## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is, including its definition, prevalence, pathophysiology, diagnostic criteria across ages, phenotypes, associated morbidities, and management principles. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative, up-to-date guideline sources to anchor the definition and diagnostic criteria. Then, I should verify prevalence estimates and reconcile differences across criteria. Next, I will examine pathophysiology and the evidence base. After that, I need to detail adult and adolescent diagnostic algorithms, including the role of AMH and exclusions. Then, I should classify phenotypes and map associated morbidities. Finally, I will synthesize management principles and highlight controversies and research gaps, ensuring each claim is supported by appropriate references.

> Let me first confirm the core definition and scope. PCOS is a heterogeneous, multisystem endocrine disorder affecting reproductive-aged women, characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovarian morphology, with substantial metabolic and psychological sequelae across the lifespan. The 2023 international guideline explicitly recognizes reproductive, metabolic, and psychological domains and integrates shared decision-making and patient-centered care into its framework [^114NTN9g] [^117ACvpo] [^114NbQzh].

> I should confirm prevalence next. Estimates vary with diagnostic criteria and population: approximately 8–13% using Rotterdam-based approaches, with some sources citing 5–18% and others up to 10–15% depending on definitions and cohorts. Adolescents show 3–11% prevalence depending on criteria, underscoring the impact of diagnostic thresholds on case ascertainment [^114n5z6q] [^114NbQzh] [^114MnVoc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality. I need to check the pathophysiology. Contemporary evidence supports a polygenic predisposition with epigenetic and developmental programming, coupled with hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian dysregulation, excess androgen exposure, insulin resistance, and adiposity-related mechanisms; importantly, insulin resistance is common even in lean women and contributes to both metabolic and reproductive dysfunction, though causality remains complex and multifactorial [^117CpVuL] [^114NbQzh] [^112xvr5S].

> Next, I should review adult diagnostic criteria and the 2023 update. Diagnosis in adults requires two of three after excluding mimics: clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, or polycystic ovarian morphology; crucially, AMH can now substitute for ultrasound to define polycystic ovarian morphology in adults, and if both irregular cycles and hyperandrogenism are present, ultrasound or AMH are not required; exclusions include thyroid disease, hyperprolactinemia, and nonclassical CAH, among others [^114NTN9g] [^111T6jk3] [^113bZato].

> Wait, let me verify the adolescent algorithm because misclassification risk is high. In adolescents, both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction are required, and neither ultrasound nor AMH should be used for diagnosis due to poor specificity; adolescents with only one feature can be labeled "at risk" with symptom management and follow-up, and the timing post-menarche matters to avoid overdiagnosis during physiologic maturation [^111T6jk3] [^116nbmP1] [^116nQGHZ].

> I will now examine the perimenopausal and menopausal context. There are no validated criteria for this life stage; a presumptive diagnosis can be made with a well-documented history of oligomenorrhea and hyperandrogenism during reproductive years, with supportive but less likely ultrasound evidence of polycystic morphology, acknowledging assay limitations for androgens post-menopause [^112Nw4mD] [^117JSkYs].

> Let me think about phenotypes because they guide risk stratification. The Rotterdam framework generates four phenotypes: A (hyperandrogenism + ovulatory dysfunction + PCOM), B (hyperandrogenism + ovulatory dysfunction), C (hyperandrogenism + PCOM), and D (ovulatory dysfunction + PCOM); phenotype A aligns with the highest metabolic risk, whereas phenotype D may be more "reproductive-only", though metabolic risk is not absent and varies by individual context [^114NbQzh] [^112xvr5S].

> I should double-check the role of AMH and its limitations. AMH has reasonable diagnostic accuracy for PCOS in adults and correlates with polycystic morphology, but there is no universal cut-off due to assay heterogeneity; in adolescents, performance is poorer, reinforcing the restriction of AMH to adult diagnosis and not for adolescent PCOS confirmation [^111K1u9H] [^114NTN9g].

> Next, I should review associated morbidities across domains. Reproductive risks include anovulatory infertility and higher gestational diabetes and hypertensive disorders. Metabolic risks include insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and increased cardiovascular risk markers. Psychological burdens include depression, anxiety, and reduced quality of life. Cancer risk is modestly elevated for endometrial cancer, with ovarian cancer risk not clearly increased [^117KpfYo] [^114P3DUY] [^116myHhh] [^112DHHtT].

> Hold on, I should verify management principles and align them with guideline strength. Lifestyle intervention is foundational for all, with emphasis on sustainable physical activity and nutrition; metformin is recommended primarily for metabolic features and is not routinely used in pregnancy; combined oral contraceptives are first-line for menstrual regulation and hyperandrogenism; letrozole is first-line for ovulation induction; shared decision-making and patient activation are emphasized to tailor care to priorities and context [^113PpF2p] [^111GXWnL] [^114NTN9g] [^1123WD1C].

> But wait, what about controversies and evidence gaps? Diagnostic criteria remain debated, with concerns about overdiagnosis in some phenotypes and underdiagnosis in others. Evidence quality is often low to moderate, necessitating ongoing research. And there is a growing call to frame PCOS more explicitly as a metabolic disorder to better align screening and treatment with cardiometabolic risk, while preserving reproductive phenotypes for clinical utility [^114NTN9g] [^114Dwkd4] [^117CpVuL] [^111DNsid].

> In summary, PCOS is a prevalent, heterogeneous endocrine disorder with reproductive, metabolic, and psychological features. Diagnosis hinges on two of three criteria after exclusions, with AMH now an acceptable surrogate for ultrasound in adults. Adolescent diagnosis requires both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction without imaging. Phenotypes stratify risk. And management is multimodal, lifestyle-centered, and individualized, with explicit attention to shared decision-making and evolving evidence [^114NTN9g] [^111T6jk3] [^114NbQzh] [^1123WD1C].

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a **common endocrine disorder** [^114NbQzh] in reproductive-aged women, defined by **hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovarian morphology** [^114JDqRv] after excluding other causes [^116qoTAs]. It affects about 8–13% of women [^114n5z6q] and is associated with insulin resistance, obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular risk, and psychological distress [^114JDqRv] [^111zT4G8] [^116myHhh]. Diagnosis in adults requires two of three features — clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound or elevated AMH [^111T6jk3] [^111K1u9H] — after ruling out mimics [^114NTN9g]; in adolescents, both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction are required, and ultrasound/AMH are not used [^116nbmP1]. Management is individualized and includes lifestyle change, hormonal therapy, and metformin for metabolic features; letrozole is first-line for ovulation induction [^113PpF2p] [^111GXWnL] [^113xdTro].

## Diagnostic criteria

The 2023 international guideline [^114NTN9g] refines the 2018 criteria [^115PeCn8] and **recommends AMH as an alternative to ultrasound** for polycystic ovarian morphology in adults [^111K1u9H] [^111T6jk3].

| **Life stage** | **Diagnostic criteria** | **Exclusion of other causes** |
|-|-|-|
| Adults | - Two of: clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism; ovulatory dysfunction; polycystic ovaries on ultrasound or elevated AMH [^111T6jk3] [^111K1u9H] | - Thyroid disease <br/> - Hyperprolactinemia <br/> - Nonclassical CAH <br/> - Cushing's <br/> - Androgen-secreting tumors [^112Nw4mD] [^113bZato] |
| Adolescents | - Both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction required <br/> - Ultrasound/AMH not recommended [^116nbmP1] | Same exclusions [^113bZato] |

---

## Clinical features

PCOS presents with **reproductive, metabolic, and psychological features**:

- **Reproductive**: oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea, infertility, hirsutism, acne, alopecia [^1166DBVf] [^112Nw4mD] [^113xdTro].
- **Metabolic**: insulin resistance, obesity, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular risk [^111zT4G8] [^112xvr5S].
- **Psychological**: depression, anxiety, reduced quality of life [^114MnVoc].

---

## Pathophysiology

PCOS is **multifactorial**, with genetic susceptibility, insulin resistance, and hyperandrogenism as key drivers [^114NbQzh] [^117CpVuL]. Insulin resistance increases androgen production and worsens metabolic risk [^113LHApx] [^117CpVuL].

---

## Long-term health risks

PCOS confers **significant long-term risks**:

- **Metabolic**: increased risk of type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease [^111zT4G8] [^112xvr5S].
- **Reproductive**: infertility, endometrial hyperplasia/cancer [^112DHHtT].
- **Psychological**: higher rates of depression, anxiety, eating disorders [^116qZ5XZ].

---

## Management

Management is **individualized and multidisciplinary**, addressing reproductive, metabolic, and psychological needs [^113xdTro] [^1123WD1C]:

- **Lifestyle**: diet, exercise, weight management for all; core therapy [^113PpF2p].
- **Pharmacologic**: combined oral contraceptives for menstrual/hyperandrogenic symptoms; metformin for metabolic features; letrozole first-line for ovulation induction [^111GXWnL] [^113xdTro].
- **Psychological**: screen for depression/anxiety, provide support and counseling [^113xdTro].

---

PCOS is a **complex endocrine disorder** with reproductive, metabolic, and psychological features; diagnosis requires careful exclusion of mimics, and management is individualized to reduce long-term risks and improve quality of life [^114NbQzh].

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 194: polycystic ovary syndrome [^1159GzjD]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries. Its etiology remains unknown, and treatment is largely symptom based and empirical. PCOS has the potential to cause substantial metabolic sequelae, including an increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and these factors should be considered when determining long-term treatment. The purpose of this document is to examine the best available evidence for the diagnosis and clinical management of PCOS.

### Do different diagnostic criteria impact polycystic ovary syndrome diagnosis for adolescents? [^115zCt1r]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Although early diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in adolescents might allow for earlier treatment and prevention of chronic disorders, incorrect or premature diagnosis carries risks of unnecessary treatment and psychological distress. There is no consensus concerning which diagnostic criteria to use for adolescents and current criteria vary. The objective of this study was to determine whether using different diagnostic criteria will affect PCOS diagnosis in adolescents.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Fifty-two patients aged 13–18 years with at least 2 of the following criteria were included in the study: (1) oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea; (2) Clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism; and (3) polycystic ovaries on ultrasonography. Patients were then categorized according to the 6 different criteria for PCOS. National Institutes of Health, Rotterdam criteria, Androgen Excess Society, Amsterdam criteria, Endocrine Society criteria, and the Pediatric Endocrine Society criteria. The characteristics of adolescents who were diagnosed with PCOS were also evaluated.

Interventions and Main Outcome Measures

Forty-one patients out of 52 (78.8%) received diagnosis with National Institutes of Health and Endocrine Society criteria, all with Rotterdam criteria, 45/52 (86.5%) with Androgen Excess Society criteria, 36/52 (69.2%) with Amsterdam criteria and 34/52 (65.4%) with the Pediatric Endocrine Society criteria.

Results and Conclusion

This study shows that the choice of guideline used does have a great effect on whether an adolescent received the PCOS diagnosis or not. For physicians using the broader criteria, care should be taken to ensure the patient does not receive diagnosis because of the physiological changes seen during puberty, which might mimic PCOS. For those using stricter criteria, close monitoring of patients who do not receive diagnosis is necessary to prevent chronic complications.

### Can anti-mullerian hormone predict the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome? A systematic review and meta-analysis of extracted data [^116XukSX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Existing biochemical tests for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have poor sensitivity and specificity. Many women with PCOS have high anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) concentrations; thus, this may be a useful addition to the diagnostic criteria.

Objective

A systematic literature review was performed to assess the true accuracy of AMH in the prediction of PCOS and to determine the optimal diagnostic threshold.

Data Sources

Published and gray literature were searched for all years until January 2013.

Study Selection

Observational studies defining PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria and assessing the value of AMH in diagnosing PCOS were selected. Ten studies of the initial 314 hits reporting AMH values in the diagnosis of PCOS were included in the meta-analysis and the construction of the summary receiver-operating characteristic curve. Four studies that plotted individual AMH serum levels of women with PCOS and controls on graphs were selected for individual data extraction.

Data Extraction

Two researchers independently assessed the abstracts resulted from the initial search against the inclusion criteria, graded the papers for selection and verification biases, and selected the papers that assessed the value of AMH in diagnosing PCOS. Data were extracted from 4 studies with the plotted individual data on graphs with the help of computer software.

Data Synthesis

The meta-analysis of the extracted data demonstrated the specificity and sensitivity in diagnosing PCOS in the symptomatic women of 79.4% and 82.8%, respectively, for a cutoff value of AMH of 4.7 ng/mL. The area under the curve was 0.87 (95% confidence interval 0.83–0.92), identical with the area under the curve of 0.87 for the summary receiver-operating characteristic curve involving 10 separate studies.

Conclusions

AMH may be a useful initial diagnostic test for PCOS subject to validation in prospective population cohorts.

Guidelines

Guidelines on polycystic ovary syndrome vary in their methodological quality, approach to diagnosis, approach to screening for health risks, and recommendations for the use of drug treatments. The 2023 update to the international polycystic ovary syndrome guidelines, which uses consensus methodology and clear grading systems for clinical recommendations, has now been released. These evidence based guidelines were developed after consultation with international multidisciplinary and consumer bodies to support clinicians and patients in the diagnosis and management of polycystic ovary syndrome and reduce variation in care.

### Controversy in clinical endocrinology: diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome: in defense of the rotterdam criteria [^116TDmmW]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Context

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a very common endocrinopathy with a heterogeneous presentation whose etiology is still uncertain. Not surprisingly, therefore, the definition of, and diagnostic criteria for, PCOS remain controversial.

Objective

The objective of the study was to review and justify the basis for the recently revised definition of PCOS arising from the joint European Society for Human Reproduction & Embryology/American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ESHRE/ASRM) Rotterdam workshop in 2003.

Intervention(S)

The Rotterdam criteria take account of the broad spectrum of presenting features of PCOS, including women with hyperandrogenism but regular menses and, more controversially, those with menstrual disturbance without overt androgen excess. POSITIONS: The Rotterdam criteria for definition and diagnosis of PCOS, in the opinion of this author, represent a significant advance in recognizing the broad spectrum of presentation of the syndrome and acknowledge that the clinical and biochemical features may vary with time within individuals. The important refinements when compared to the 1990 NIH definition of PCOS are: 1) inclusion of polycystic ovarian morphology; and 2) inclusion of subjects with hirsutism and regular menses.

Conclusions

These new diagnostic criteria for PCOS reflect the significant advances, particularly from studies of familial PCOS, in understanding of the etiology of the syndrome and the basis for its heterogeneity. Under the revised diagnostic criteria, the inclusion of women with hyperandrogenism and regular cycles has met with general agreement. The inclusion of women with oligomenorrhea and polycystic ovaries who do not have clear evidence of androgen excess is, in the opinion of this author, also justified but remains a contentious issue and one that requires further investigation.

DISCUSSION

The International Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS and the related translation program aims to provide clinicians with a quality, reliable source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide consistent clinical practice and to empower women with evidence-based information. All recommendations were formulated after an assessment of the best available evidence, multidisciplinary clinical expertise, consumer preferences and structured review by the five GDGs. Detailed methods for stakeholder engagement and guideline development can be found at. The guideline provides 166 recommendations: evidence-based recommendations (EBR) = 31, clinical consensus recommendations (CCR) = 59, and clinical practice points (CPP) = 76. Overall evidence is of low to moderate quality, requiring significant research expansion in this neglected, yet common condition.

We endorse the Rotterdam PCOS Diagnostic Criteria in adults (two of oligo- or anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound), after exclusion of related disorders. Where both oligo- or anovulation and hyperandrogenism are present, ultrasound is not necessary for diagnosis. In adolescents, both oligo-anovulation and hyperandrogenism are required, with ultrasound not recommended for diagnosis. Ultrasound criteria are refined with advancing technology. Antimüllerian hormone levels are not yet adequate for diagnosis of PCOS. Insulin resistance is recognized as a key feature of PCOS, yet clinical measurement is not recommended at the current time. Once diagnosed, assessment and management includes reproductive, metabolic, and psychological features. Education, self-empowerment, multidisciplinary care, and lifestyle intervention for prevention or management of excess weight are prioritized. Depressive and anxiety symptoms should be screened, assessed, and managed and health professionals should be aware of other impacts on emotional wellbeing and quality of life. Combined oral contraceptive pills are first-line pharmacological management for menstrual irregularity and hyperandrogenism, with no specific formulation recommended and with low-dose preparations preferred. Metformin is recommended in addition or alone, primarily for management of metabolic features. Letrozole is first-line pharmacological infertility therapy; with clomiphene and metformin both having a role, alone and in combination. In women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility, gonadotrophins are second line. In the absence of an absolute indication for IVF, women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility could be offered IVF third line where other ovulation induction therapies have failed.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^113PpF2p]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — lifestyle management recommends that lifestyle intervention (exercise alone or multicomponent diet combined with exercise and behavioural strategies) should be recommended for all women with PCOS, for improving metabolic health including central adiposity and lipid profile. Healthy lifestyle behaviours encompassing healthy eating and/or physical activity should be recommended in all women with PCOS to optimize general health, quality of life, body composition and weight management (maintaining weight, preventing weight gain and/or modest weight loss). Healthcare professionals should be aware that lifestyle management is a core focus in PCOS management, lifestyle management goals and priorities should be co-developed in partnership with women with PCOS, and value women's individualized preferences, and there are benefits to a healthy lifestyle even in the absence of weight loss.

### Consensus on women's health aspects of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): the amsterdam ESHRE / ASRM-sponsored 3rd PCOS consensus workshop group [^1166DBVf]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome — menstrual irregularity — PCOS commonly includes oligo-ovulation or anovulation, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries, while obesity and insulin resistance are commonly encountered but are not required for diagnosis. Amenorrhea is generally defined as intervals between periods exceeding 199 days, whereas oligomenorrhea involves intercycle intervals between 35 and 199 days; spontaneous ovulations can occur, with a placebo-arm randomized controlled trial reporting ovulation in 32% of cycles. In women with oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea, there is an approximately 90% chance that PCOS will also be diagnosed.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and COVID-19: an overlooked female patient population at potentially higher risk during the COVID-19 pandemic [^117EYGej]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

At a first glance, women with PCOS appear to belong to an age and sex group which is considered as less affected by COVID-19. However, it should be highlighted that within this common female patient population there is high prevalence of numerous conditions/factors which may significantly increase the risk for worse COVID-19-related outcomes. This strong overlap should not be overlooked in clinical practice, particularly since women with PCOS often receive fragmented care from multiple healthcare services. In parallel, informing women with PCOS regarding the potential risks from COVID-19 and how this may affect their management is also necessary. Overall, despite the immense challenges posed by the COVID-19 outbreak in affected countries, attention should be directed to maintain a high standard of care for complex patients, such as many women with PCOS, and provide relevant practical recommendations for optimal management in the setting of this fast moving pandemic.

### Updated adolescent diagnostic criteria for polycystic ovary syndrome: impact on prevalence and longitudinal body mass index trajectories from birth to adulthood [^114Lj8ey]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy in women of reproductive age with an estimated prevalence of 8–13%. Its pathogenesis includes insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism which drive the reproductive (menstrual dysfunction, infertility), metabolic (metabolic syndrome, diabetes, cardiovascular risk factors), and psychological (anxiety, depression, low quality of life) complications. Given the high prevalence and diverse features across the lifespan, as well as the high prevalence of obesity which further exacerbates its clinical features, PCOS contributes to the global burden of disease. It is therefore imperative to recognize the condition early to facilitate interventions and prevent complications.

Being a heterogeneous disorder, the diagnosis of PCOS is difficult and often delayed. PCOS diagnosis is based on oligo-anovulation (OA), biochemical or clinical hyperandrogenism (HA), and polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM) on ultrasound extending across the original 1990 National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria (OA and HA), the 2003 Rotterdam criteria (any two of OA, HA, and PCOM), and the Androgen Excess and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (AE-PCOS) Society criteria (HA and OA or PCOM or both). The Rotterdam criteria are now widely accepted and generate four possible diagnostic PCOS phenotypes in adult women: (A) OA + HA + PCOM, (B) OA + HA, (C) HA + PCOM, and (D) OA + PCOM. The Rotterdam criteria are recommended and endorsed by the 2018 international PCOS evidence-based guideline, which was co-developed based on unprecedented evidence synthesis and best practice methods, by world-leading multidisciplinary clinicians and researchers across 37 societies from 71 countries, with consumer engagement.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^117WToWx]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for amenorrhea, more specifically with respect to evaluation for etiology (PCOS), ES 2013 guidelines recommend to consider making a presumptive diagnosis of PCOS in perimenopausal and menopausal patients with a well-documented long-term history of oligomenorrhea and hyperandrogenism during the reproductive years. Look for the presence of polycystic ovarian morphology on ultrasound to provide additional supportive evidence, recognizing that this is less likely to present in menopausal patients.

### The diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome: the criteria are insufficiently robust for clinical research [^116PgXbM]. Clinical Endocrinology (2007). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common disorder but has considerable phenotypic variability and this has led to controversy over its exact definition and diagnosis. The objective of this study was to review the recently proposed diagnostic criteria to determine whether they were sufficiently robust for clinical and research practise. We have reviewed the literature pertaining to clinical measurement and quality of laboratory analysis in relation to clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism. The recently published statements regarding the diagnosis of PCOS assume that the clinical, laboratory and imaging studies are dichotomous variables, without considering the effect of observer subjectivity or measurement variability on the outcome. The data suggest that there is considerable uncertainty of all measurements and lack of clarity of the definition of the term 'hyperandrogenaemia' which can lead to misdiagnosis. The current diagnostic strategies for PCOS are defined too vaguely to ascertain that individuals fit the definition of the syndrome. A pragmatic approach may be taken in the management of an individual depending upon her particular symptoms and needs. However, research into the epidemiology, pathophysiology and treatment of PCOS will require the production of robust definitions of the diagnostic criteria. We propose specific criteria that would answer the criticisms that we have raised.

### Renaming PCOS – a two-state solution [^111DNsid]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

It has become evident over the past 30 years that polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is more than a reproductive disorder. It has metabolic sequelae that can affect women across the lifespan. Diagnostic criteria based on the endocrine features of the syndrome, hyperandrogenism and chronic anovulation, such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria, identify women at high metabolic risk. The additional phenotypes defined by the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria identify women with primarily reproductive rather than metabolic dysfunction.

Objective

The aim is to discuss the rationale for a separate name for the syndrome that is associated with high metabolic risk while maintaining the current name for the phenotypes with primarily reproductive morbidity.

Intervention

The NIH Office for Disease Prevention-Sponsored Evidence-Based Methodology Workshop on Polycystic Ovary Syndrome recommended that a new name is needed for PCOS. POSITIONS: The authors propose that PCOS be retained for the reproductive phenotypes and that a new name be created for the phenotypes at high metabolic risk.

Conclusions

There should be two names for the PCOS phenotypes: those with primarily reproductive consequences should continue to be called PCOS, and those with important metabolic consequences should have a new name.

### Challenges in diagnosis and understanding of natural history of polycystic ovary syndrome [^116ZAGGh]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy affecting 8%-13% of reproductive-aged women. The aetiology of the syndrome is complex, with genetic susceptibility, androgen exposure in early life and adiposity related dysfunction leading to perturbance in hypothalamic-ovarian function. PCOS clinical features are heterogeneous, with manifestations arising even in early adolescence, developing into multisystem reproductive, metabolic and psychological manifestations in adulthood. In this review, we will discuss challenges in the diagnosis of PCOS and understanding of the natural history of PCOS.

### Consensus on women's health aspects of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): the amsterdam ESHRE / ASRM-sponsored 3rd PCOS consensus workshop group [^111p8RrA]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

PCOS after menopause — conclusions and research needs indicate that age may improve many manifestations of PCOS, including normalizing ovarian size and morphology, T levels, and oligo-ovulation before menopause (level B). Priority gaps include that there are little data on long-term fecundity and precise age of menopause in women with PCOS; the long-term risk for morbidity and mortality among postmenopausal women with a history of PCOS is uncertain; there is no established phenotype for PCOS after menopause; most clinical assays are not precise for determining T levels in postmenopausal women; long-term, multicenter cohort studies are needed to assess menopausal phenotype, cardiovascular events, cancer, and other causes of morbidity/mortality; and genomewide association studies should be used to identify new genes/pathways involved in ovarian dysfunction related to age of menopause and polycystic ovaries.

Summary of Recommendations

1.0 Diagnosis of PCOS

Diagnosis in adults

1.1 We suggest that the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) be made if two of the three following criteria are met: androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction, or polycystic ovaries (PCO) (Tables 1 and 2), whereas disorders that mimic the clinical features of PCOS are excluded. These include, in all women: thyroid disease, hyperprolactinemia, and nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (primarily 21-hydroxylase deficiency by serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone [17-OHP]) (Table 3). In select women with amenorrhea and more severe phenotypes, we suggest more extensive evaluation excluding other causes (Table 4) (2|⊕⊕⊕○).

Other Diagnoses to Exclude in All Women Before Making a Diagnosis of PCOS

Table 4.
Diagnoses to Consider Excluding in Select Women, Depending on Presentation

Diagnosis in adolescents

1.2 We suggest that the diagnosis of PCOS in an adolescent girl be made based on the presence of clinical and/or biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism (after exclusion of other pathologies) in the presence of persistent oligomenorrhea. Anovulatory symptoms and PCO morphology are not sufficient to make a diagnosis in adolescents, as they may be evident in normal stages in reproductive maturation (2|⊕⊕○○).

Diagnosis in perimenopause and menopause

1.3 Although there are currently no diagnostic criteria for PCOS in perimenopausal and menopausal women, we suggest that a presumptive diagnosis of PCOS can be based upon a well-documented long-term history of oligomenorrhea and hyperandrogenism during the reproductive years. The presence of PCO morphology on ultrasound would provide additional supportive evidence, although this is less likely in a menopausal woman (2|⊕⊕○○).

2.0 Associated morbidity and evaluation

Cutaneous manifestations

2.1 We recommend that a physical examination should document cutaneous manifestations of PCOS: terminal hair growth (see hirsutism guidelines, Ref.), acne, alopecia, acanthosis nigricans, and skin tags (1|⊕⊕⊕○).

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a heterogeneous and chronic condition, today affects about 5% of women of reproductive age. PCOS is strongly associated with states of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Risk factors include genetics, metabolic profiles, and the in utero environment. Long-term consequences of PCOS include metabolic complications such as diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. Dysregulation of insulin action is closely linked to the pathogenesis of PCOS. However, whether insulin resistance is the causative factor in the development of PCOS remains to be ascertained. Moreover, the mechanism by which insulin resistance may lead to reproductive dysfunction requires further elucidation.

Rebranding PCOS as a unique reproductive/metabolic disorder — metabolic syndrome (MetS) linkage and stratification implications are noted: The metabolic syndrome is described as a constellation of cardiovascular disease risk factors associated with insulin resistance, and women with classic NIH-criteria PCOS have significantly increased rates of MetS compared with reproductively normal women of similar age and weight. Hyperandrogenism may be an independent contributor to MetS risk, endogenous androgen levels are higher in women with MetS without PCOS, and blocking androgen action or improving insulin sensitivity can improve features of MetS in PCOS. It is now widely appreciated that PCOS is a metabolic as well as a reproductive disorder, the long-term impact of related metabolic disorders remains poorly studied, and the weight of the evidence indicates that not all PCOS phenotypes have similar metabolic risk; it is critical for public health and for the design of long-term studies to stratify women with PCOS according to metabolic risk. To facilitate this, a specific name for the high-risk subset is proposed as helpful, with suggested options including Syndrome XX, Female Metabolic Syndrome (FMS), or Metabolic Reproductive Syndrome (MRS).

INTRODUCTION

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy affecting reproductive aged women, with a prevalence of between 8% and 13% depending on the population studied and definitions used. PCOS is complex with reproductive, metabolic and psychological features. Clinical practice in the assessment and management of PCOS is inconsistent, with key evidence practice gaps, whilst women internationally have highlighted delayed diagnosis and dissatisfaction with care. Current guidelines either are limited in breadth, do not follow rigorous best practice in development, have not involved consumers, or are outdated, resulting in inconsistent guidance for clinicians and women alike. To address these identified gaps, here we summarize the development process and recommendations from the first international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS, bringing together extensive consumer engagement and international collaboration with leading societies and organizations, multidisciplinary experts, and primary care representatives. In this process, the guideline development groups unanimously supported the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria for adult women.

This comprehensive evidence-based guideline builds on prior high quality guidelines and culminates from a rigorous, Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation-II (AGREEII)-compliant, evidence-based guideline development process. It provides a single source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide clinical practice with the opportunity for adaptation in relevant health systems. Together with an extensive translation program, the aim is to reduce worldwide variation in care and promote high quality service provision to improve health outcomes and quality of life in women with PCOS. The guidelines are supported by a multifaceted international translation program with co-designed resources to enhance the skills of health professionals and empower women with PCOS, with an integrated comprehensive evaluation program.

1 INTRODUCTION

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex heterogeneous multisystem disorder affecting 8%–13% of reproductive‐aged womenand 3%–11% of adolescent girlsdepending on the diagnostic criteria used and the population studied. PCOS is characterized by oligo/amenorrhoea, clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism (HA) and polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM) on ultrasound in adult women.PCOS has significant metabolic (obesity, metabolic syndrome, impaired glucose tolerance, type 2 diabetes (T2DM), cardiovascular risk factors), reproductive (anovulation, subfertility)and psychological (depression, anxiety, eating disorders, impaired quality of life), sequelae. Diagnosis of PCOS using the 2003 Rotterdam criteria is based on the presence of two of three features: oligo/amenorrhoea, clinical/biochemical HA and PCOM on ultrasound following exclusion of secondary causes. The Rotterdam criteria are recommended and endorsed by the 2018 international PCOS evidence‐based guideline (EBG) for adult women. This guideline with recommendations for PCOS diagnosis and management is underpinned by an extensive process of evidence synthesis involving 37 professional societies and consumer groups around the world, 71 experts in all aspects of PCOS, including consumers and extensive literature review with 40 systematic reviews and 20 narrative reviews detailed in the 1800 page guideline evidence document.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome: a metabolic disorder with therapeutic opportunities [^1134LYus]. Cell Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a highly prevalent endocrine disorder characterized by intertwined reproductive and metabolic abnormalities. While its causal origins remain incompletely understood, accumulating evidence suggests metabolic dysfunctions-manifested by insulin resistance, obesity, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia-as key contributors to the pathogenesis and progression of PCOS. Emerging interventions targeting these metabolic disturbances, including caloric restriction, GLP-1-based therapies, and bariatric surgery, have shown efficacy in alleviating PCOS symptoms and potentially blocking their inheritance. By addressing the metabolic roots and therapeutic opportunities in PCOS, this perspective highlights a critical shift in fundamentally recognizing PCOS as a metabolic disorder. The future promises more metabolic-focused research to unravel the underlying pathogenesis and develop precise, long-term strategies for managing this complex disease.

Study Question

What is the recommended assessment and management of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), based on the best available evidence, clinical expertise, and consumer preference?

Summary Answer

International evidence-based guidelines including 166 recommendations and practice points, addressed prioritized questions to promote consistent, evidence-based care and improve the experience and health outcomes of women with PCOS.

What Is Known Already

Previous guidelines either lacked rigorous evidence-based processes, did not engage consumer and international multidisciplinary perspectives, or were outdated. Diagnosis of PCOS remains controversial and assessment and management are inconsistent. The needs of women with PCOS are not being adequately met and evidence practice gaps persist.

Study Design, Size, Duration

International evidence-based guideline development engaged professional societies and consumer organizations with multidisciplinary experts and women with PCOS directly involved at all stages. Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II-compliant processes were followed, with extensive evidence synthesis. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied across evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation and ultimately recommendation strength.

Participants/Materials, Setting, Methods

Governance included a six continent international advisory and a project board, five guideline development groups, and consumer and translation committees. Extensive health professional and consumer engagement informed guideline scope and priorities. Engaged international society-nominated panels included pediatrics, endocrinology, gynecology, primary care, reproductive endocrinology, obstetrics, psychiatry, psychology, dietetics, exercise physiology, public health and other experts, alongside consumers, project management, evidence synthesis, and translation experts. Thirty-seven societies and organizations covering 71 countries engaged in the process. Twenty face-to-face meetings over 15 months addressed 60 prioritized clinical questions involving 40 systematic and 20 narrative reviews. Evidence-based recommendations were developed and approved via consensus voting within the five guideline panels, modified based on international feedback and peer review, with final recommendations approved across all panels.

Main Results and The Role Of Chance

The evidence in the assessment and management of PCOS is generally of low to moderate quality. The guideline provides 31 evidence based recommendations, 59 clinical consensus recommendations and 76 clinical practice points all related to assessment and management of PCOS. Key changes in this guideline include: i) considerable refinement of individual diagnostic criteria with a focus on improving accuracy of diagnosis; ii) reducing unnecessary testing; iii) increasing focus on education, lifestyle modification, emotional wellbeing and quality of life; and iv) emphasizing evidence based medical therapy and cheaper and safer fertility management.

Limitations, Reasons For Caution

Overall evidence is generally low to moderate quality, requiring significantly greater research in this neglected, yet common condition, especially around refining specific diagnostic features in PCOS. Regional health system variation is acknowledged and a process for guideline and translation resource adaptation is provided.

Wider Implications Of The Findings

The international guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS provides clinicians with clear advice on best practice based on the best available evidence, expert multidisciplinary input and consumer preferences. Research recommendations have been generated and a comprehensive multifaceted dissemination and translation program supports the guideline with an integrated evaluation program.

Study Funding/Competing Interest(S)

The guideline was primarily funded by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (NHMRC) supported by a partnership with ESHRE and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. Guideline development group members did not receive payment. Travel expenses were covered by the sponsoring organizations. Disclosures of conflicts of interest were declared at the outset and updated throughout the guideline process, aligned with NHMRC guideline processes. Full details of conflicts declared across the guideline development groups are available at https://www.monash.edu/medicine/sphpm/mchri/pcos/guideline in the Register of disclosures of interest.

PCOS affects 1 in 8 women in the United States and globally and is a well‐established metabolic condition with increased CVRFs. Nevertheless, the condition remains largely unnoticed within the cardiology field, often perceived as yet another "silent" women's health condition. Despite the recent call to action by the American Heart Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which urged health care professionals to identify women at risk using sex‐specific risk information, PCOS is still woefully underrecognized in terms of its association with CVD risk. The 2023 International Evidence‐Based Guideline in PCOSrecognized the importance of addressing this issue and, thus, commissioned and led this comprehensive systematic review and meta‐analysis. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship of clinical CVD and PCOS, defined by any criteria. The findings from this study directly informed the 2023 International Evidence‐Based PCOS Guideline.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — diabetes, metabolic syndrome (MetS), and adiposity: The severity of insulin resistance is related to the amount of abdominal obesity in women with PCOS, even when they are not obese. The odds of prevalent diabetes are approximately three times higher in women with PCOS compared with women without PCOS; in BMI-matched studies, the odds are approximately double. Women with classic PCOS are more likely to have prevalent type 2 diabetes (T2D), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and/or MetS, and in BMI-matched studies, the odds of prevalent disease are 2.5 times higher. More severe phenotypes are associated with more metabolic syndrome in both obese and nonobese women.

Discussion

This manuscript summarizes specific adolescent recommendations from the 2023 International Evidence-based PCOS Guideline. The Guideline was a result of extensive international engagement and robust methodological evidence-based processes and was independently reviewed. This manuscript provides healthcare professionals, adolescents, and their families with the most recent evidence-based recommendations to improve health outcomes. There are fewer recommendations for adolescents than for adult women highlighting the limited number of adolescent PCOS studies and emphasizing the need for further research.

Adolescent PCOS diagnosis has always been challenging as normal physiological changes overlap with adult PCOS diagnostic criteria resulting in delayed and underdiagnosis as well as potential overdiagnosis. While evidence supports the use of PCOM and AMH levels for the diagnosis of PCOS in adults, PCOM or AMH should not be used for diagnosis in adolescents to minimize the risk of overdiagnosis. PCOM or AMH can be used at approximately 8 years postmenarche when the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis is mature and evidence-based criteria for PCOM are available.

For adolescent PCOS diagnosis, the Guideline recommends the combination of menstrual irregularities defined according to the time postmenarche and clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism following the exclusion of other disorders. The use of these well-defined criteria for PCOS diagnosis during adolescence will promote accurate and timely diagnosis during this life stage. This approach will allow the detection of adolescents at considerable risk of weight gain and diabetes by establishing early screening with the management of long-term metabolic risks and enabling the optimization of long-term fertility outcomes. As delayed diagnosis has been reported in adolescents, adolescents with either menstrual irregularities or clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism can be considered "at risk" for PCOS. This tactic addresses concerns of inappropriately labeling an adolescent with a PCOS diagnosis while avoiding delayed diagnosis when appropriate follow-up is in place.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes and follow-up emphasize that life-long metabolic dysfunction in women with PCOS 'exaggerates the risk for CVD with aging, particularly after menopause' and is 'based upon insulin resistance, which occurs in most women with PCOS and is independent of and additive with obesity'. Women with PCOS 'also have more subclinical vascular disease than normal women', and 'coronary artery calcification and carotid intima media wall thickness are also increased in women with PCOS compared with matched controls (level B)'. Among nondiabetic postmenopausal women with intact ovaries, atherosclerotic CVD 'is associated with features of PCOS' (level B). However, 'evidence for increased CVD morbidity and mortality in women with PCOS… remains inconclusive' and 'uncertainty exists as to whether PCOS status per se increases cardiovascular mortality'. For monitoring, 'periodic reassessment for CVD risk is recommended (GPP)'. Consensus conclusions state that 'life-long metabolic dysfunction in women with PCOS exaggerates CVD risk, causing a possible increase in CVD events with age, especially after menopause (level B)', that 'all surrogate markers of cardiovascular risk are higher in PCOS (adjusted for age and BMI), but the association of these markers with cardiovascular events in PCOS remains unclear (level B)', and that 'endothelial dysfunction in PCOS is related to abdominal obesity and insulin resistance (level B)'. Noted research gaps include that 'data are lacking regarding ethnic and racial differences in the set point for vascular damage associated with PCOS' and that 'longitudinal studies are needed to associate cardiovascular markers with vascular events'.

Background

During adolescence, accurate diagnostic criteria and/or identification of adolescents "at risk" of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are critical to establish appropriate screening, treatment, and lifelong health plans. The 2023 International Evidence-Based Guideline for PCOS aimed to provide the most up-to-date evidence-based recommendations to improve health outcomes for individuals with PCOS, emphasizing accurate and timely diagnosis of PCOS from adolescence.

Methods

The best practice methods following the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE-II) criteria were applied. Healthcare professionals and patients/consumers reviewed extensive evidence synthesis/meta-analysis for 55 prioritized clinical questions. Databases (OVID MEDLINE, All EBM, PsycInfo, EMBASE, CINAHL) were searched until August 2022 as part of the 2023 update of the Guideline. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework guided experts on evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation, and ultimately recommendation strength.

Results

This manuscript focuses on the adolescent-specific recommendations of the 2023 Guideline. The diagnosis is based on the presence of both irregular menstrual cycles (defined according to the time postmenarche) and clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism following the exclusion of other disorders that mimic PCOS. Adolescents with only one of these features can be considered "at risk" of PCOS requiring the management of symptoms and ongoing follow-up. Polycystic ovarian morphology on pelvic ultrasonography or anti-Müllerian hormone levels should not be used for diagnosis during adolescence. Lifelong health planning is recommended to include healthy lifestyles, screening for depression and metabolic features and the transition to adult care, all underpinned by shared decision-making. Healthcare professionals should explain weight-related health risks to adolescents, while minimizing weight stigma. In adolescents with PCOS or "at risk" of PCOS, combined oral contraceptive pills are indicated for menstrual irregularity and clinical hyperandrogenism, focusing on low dose preparations, and metformin could be considered for metabolic features and cycle regulation. Overall, the evidence is limited in adolescents with PCOS, and recommendations are based on low to moderate certainty evidence.

Conclusions

Extensive international engagement and rigorous processes generated International Guideline diagnostic criteria for adolescents that differ from adult criteria and clarified appropriate screening and management strategies for PCOS during adolescence.

### Revised 2003 consensus on diagnostic criteria and long-term health risks related to polycystic ovary syndrome [^114JDqRv]. Fertility and Sterility (2004). Low credibility.

Since the 1990 National Institutes of Health-sponsored conference on polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), it has become appreciated that the syndrome encompasses a broader spectrum of signs and symptoms of ovarian dysfunction than those defined by the original diagnostic criteria. The 2003 Rotterdam consensus workshop concluded that PCOS is a syndrome of ovarian dysfunction along with the cardinal features hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovary (PCO) morphology. PCOS remains a syndrome, and as such no single diagnostic criterion (such as hyperandrogenism or PCO) is sufficient for clinical diagnosis. Its clinical manifestations may include menstrual irregularities, signs of androgen excess, and obesity. Insulin resistance and elevated serum LH levels are also common features in PCOS. PCOS is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular events.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in females, with a high prevalence. The etiology of this heterogeneous condition remains obscure, and its phenotype expression varies. Two widely cited previous ESHRE/ASRM sponsored PCOS consensus workshops focused on diagnosis (published in 2004) and infertility management (published in 2008), respectively. The present third PCOS consensus report summarizes current knowledge and identifies knowledge gaps regarding various women's health aspects of PCOS. Relevant topics addressed-all dealt with in a systematic fashion-include adolescence, hirsutism and acne, contraception, menstrual cycle abnormalities, quality of life, ethnicity, pregnancy complications, long-term metabolic and cardiovascular health, and finally cancer risk. Additional, comprehensive background information is provided separately in an extended online publication.

### Approach to the patient: diagnostic challenges in the workup for polycystic ovary syndrome [^112ZypAD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

PCOS diagnosis is complex with the diagnostic criteria generating 4 clinical phenotypes in adults: phenotype A (featuring hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and PCOM), phenotype B (hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction without PCOM), phenotype C (hyperandrogenism and PCOM without ovulatory dysfunction), and phenotype D (ovulatory dysfunction and PCOM without hyperandrogenism). In addition, clinical features of PCOS are heterogeneous with manifestations varying across individuals and the reproductive life stage. While clinical presentation in PCOS does not necessarily correlate with genotype, subdividing PCOS patients by key clinical presentation, such as the presence or absence of hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction and PCOM (ie, phenotypes A-D) is helpful to determine what diagnostic testing may be required. For example, women with clinical evidence of hyperandrogenism (eg, hirsutism) and ovulatory dysfunction require only the exclusion of mimicking disorders for the diagnosis of PCOS. Alternatively, women who present solely with menstrual dysfunction may require assessment of ovarian morphology and/or circulating androgens, and if either of these is abnormal, then exclusion of mimicking disorders. Meanwhile, women presenting with what appears to be solely hirsutism merit being evaluated by ovarian ultrasonography or AMH levels, before assessing for mimicking disorders.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — patient care and shared decision-making emphasizes that healthcare professionals should employ shared decision-making and support patient agency or ability to take independent actions to manage their health and care, and the importance of being knowledgeable about PCOS, of applying evidence-based practices when sharing news on diagnosis, treatment, and health implications, and of ascertaining and focusing on patient priorities, should be recognized. Healthcare system leaders should enable system wide changes that support healthcare professional training, knowledge and practice in sharing news optimally, shared decision making and patient agency, including ensuring adequate consultation time and accessible resources. Evidence-based strategies for shared decision making and for sharing news (such as the SPIKES framework) are readily available and should be used to inform PCOS care, all healthcare professionals partnering with women with PCOS should be knowledgeable in sharing news, in shared decision-making, and in supporting patient self-management, and evidence-based strategies and resources can be used to support patient activation, which refers to modifiable knowledge, skills, ability, confidence, and willingness to self-manage one's own health and care.

Processes aligned with all elements of the AGREE-II tool for quality guideline assessment, with extensive evidence synthesis and meta-analysis. Integrity assessment was integrated into guideline evidence synthesis processes and followed the Research Integrity in Guideline Development (RIGID) framework, with studies assessed against criteria from the Research Integrity Assessment (RIA) tool and the Trustworthiness in RAndomised Controlled Trials (TRACT) checklist. Evidence synthesis methods are outlined in the full guideline and followed best practice Guideline recommendations are presented by category, terms used, evidence quality and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework considerations. Category includes evidence-based (sufficient evidence in PCOS) or consensus (insufficient evidence in PCOS, also evidence in general or relevant populations was considered) recommendations and accompanying practice points (implementation considerations) (Table 1).

Table 1.
Categories of PCOS guideline recommendations

The terms include "should", "could" and "should not", which are informed by the nature of the recommendation (evidence or consensus), the GRADE framework and the evidence quality and are independent descriptors reflecting GDG judgement. They refer to overall interpretation and practical application of the recommendation, balancing benefits and harms. "Should" is used where benefits of the recommendation exceed harms and where the recommendation can be trusted to guide practice. Conditional recommendations are reflected using the terms "could" or "should/could consider" which are used where evidence quality was limited or available studies demonstrate little clear advantage of one approach over another, or the balance of benefits to harms was unclear. "Should not" applies when there is a lack of appropriate evidence, or harms may outweigh benefits.

Method of Development of Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines

The Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society deemed the diagnosis and treatment of PCOS a priority area in need of practice guidelines and appointed a Task Force to formulate evidence-based recommendations. The Task Force followed the approach recommended by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) group, an international group with expertise in development and implementation of evidence-based guidelines. A detailed description of the grading scheme has been published elsewhere. The Task Force used the best available research evidence to develop the recommendations. The Task Force also used consistent language and graphical descriptions of both the strength of a recommendation and the quality of evidence. In terms of the strength of the recommendation, strong recommendations use the phrase "we recommend" and the number 1, and weak recommendations use the phrase "we suggest" and the number 2. Cross-filled circles indicate the quality of the evidence, such that ⊕○○○ denotes very low quality evidence; ⊕⊕○○, low quality; ⊕⊕⊕○, moderate quality; and ⊕⊕⊕⊕, high quality. The Task Force has confidence that persons who receive care according to the strong recommendations will derive, on average, more good than harm. Weak recommendations require more careful consideration of the person's circumstances, values, and preferences to determine the best course of action. Linked to each recommendation is a description of the evidence and the values that panelists considered in making the recommendation; in some instances, there are remarks, a section in which panelists offer technical suggestions for testing conditions, dosing, and monitoring. These technical comments reflect the best available evidence applied to a typical person being treated. Often this evidence comes from the unsystematic observations of the panelists and their values and preferences; therefore, these remarks are considered.

Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) — diagnostic definitions and treatment guidance include the following: "Of the three definitions of PCOS, the one suggested by NIH, as well as the definition put forward by the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society, includes the presence of hyperandrogenism as a required criterion", whereas "the Rotterdam definition… allows for several possible phenotypes, being defined by two of three of the following criteria: menstrual irregularity, polycystic ovaries on ultrasound and hyperandrogenism. Thus, it is possible for PCOS to be diagnosed in the absence of documented hyperandrogenism". For management, "prior to initiation of any intervention, emphasis should be given to the importance of lifestyle management, especially weight reduction", and "the recommended first-line treatment for ovulation induction remains the anti-estrogen clomifene citrate (CC)". "The use of aromatase inhibitors for ovulation induction seems to be as effective as CC, but insufficient evidence is currently available on its efficacy and safety", while "Metformin alone is less effective than CC", and adding metformin to CC "should be restricted to women with glucose intolerance"; accordingly, "the routine use of this drug in ovulation induction is not recommended". If ovulation fails or no pregnancy occurs, "the proposed second-line intervention includes either exogenous gonadotropins or laparoscopic ovarian surgery (LOS)", with exogenous gonadotropins "associated with increased chances for multiple pregnancies" requiring "careful monitoring of ovarian response".

### Polycystic ovary syndrome. A diagnostic challenge [^114YQdLZ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome remains a diagnostic challenge because there is no single defining test. The clinical presentation must dictate the extent of the work-up. The typical PCOS patient has a history of irregular menses and appears hirsute. Demonstration of ovulatory dysfunction and hyperandrogenism can also be made by appropriate hormonal measurements. An ultrasound showing multiple small ovarian follicles can support a diagnosis of PCOS in the patient for whom the clinical diagnosis has been made. Other causes of hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction should be excluded.

Insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome (MetS) — polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) pathophysiology and consensus statements: Insulin resistance is a prevalent finding in the obese in general, and in women with PCOS, and it is most prevalent and severe in those with the classic NIH PCOS phenotype involving hyperandrogenism and chronic anovulation, whereas women with PCOS assessed by the Rotterdam criteria yet with regular cycles are metabolically less abnormal. In vivo insulin action is profoundly decreased in skeletal muscle secondary to signaling defects, hepatic insulin resistance is present only in obese women with PCOS, there is a synergistic negative effect of having both PCOS and obesity on insulin action, and pancreatic β-cell dysfunction is most severe in women with a first-degree relative who has T2D. Extensive evidence indicates that hyperinsulinemia contributes directly to reproductive dysfunction in PCOS, and women with classic NIH PCOS have significantly increased rates of the MetS compared with reproductively normal women of similar age and weight. Consensus conclusions state that metabolic disorders associated with PCOS are major predictors of prediabetes, diabetes, and MetS in reproductive-age women (level B); patients with MetS are an important clinical subset of women with PCOS (level B); not all PCOS phenotypes have similar metabolic risk, with the combination of hyperandrogenemia and oligomenorrhea signifying the most at-risk group (level B); and it is critical for public health and for optimum design of long-term studies to stratify women with PCOS according to metabolic risk, a goal that would be greatly facilitated by using a specific name for this high metabolic risk PCOS subset (GPP).

Discussion

The International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS and the related translation program aims to provide a high quality, reliable source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide consistent clinical practice and to empower women with evidence-based information. All recommendations were formulated after an assessment of the best available evidence, multidisciplinary clinical expertise, consumer preferences and structured review by five GDGs. The guideline provides 77 evidence-based and 54 consensus recommendations, with 123 practice points underpinned by a technical report on evidence synthesis and GRADE detailed considerations (∼6000 pages). The evidence has generally improved over the past five years but remains of low to moderate quality, requiring significant research investment into this neglected, yet common condition.

Key recommendations and updates include that PCOS should be diagnosed using the 2018 International Evidence-based Guideline criteria, which built on the consensus based 2003 Rotterdam criteria. This requires the presence of two of the following: i) clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism; ii) ovulatory dysfunction; and iii) polycystic ovaries on ultrasound; and here in 2023, alternatively anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) can now be used instead of ultrasound. Exclusion of other aetiologies. Importantly, where irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism are present, diagnosis is simplified and ultrasound or AMH are not required for diagnosis. In adolescents, both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction are required, with ultrasound and AMH not recommended due to poor specificity. AMH was highlighted as a rapidly evolving area in 2018 and evidence is now strong enough to make this new recommendation. This will significantly change practice and offers women a low cost, convenient option, without evidence of overdiagnosis.

Study Question

What is the recommended assessment and management of those with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), based on the best available evidence, clinical expertise, and consumer preference?

Summary Answer

International evidence-based guidelines address prioritized questions and outcomes and include 254 recommendations and practice points, to promote consistent, evidence-based care and improve the experience and health outcomes in PCOS.

What Is Known Already

The 2018 International PCOS Guideline was independently evaluated as high quality and integrated multidisciplinary and consumer perspectives from six continents; it is now used in 196 countries and is widely cited. It was based on best available, but generally very low to low quality, evidence. It applied robust methodological processes and addressed shared priorities. The guideline transitioned from consensus based to evidence-based diagnostic criteria and enhanced accuracy of diagnosis, whilst promoting consistency of care. However, diagnosis is still delayed, the needs of those with PCOS are not being adequately met, evidence quality was low and evidence-practice gaps persist.

Study Design, Size, Duration

The 2023 International Evidence-based Guideline update reengaged the 2018 network across professional societies and consumer organizations with multidisciplinary experts and women with PCOS directly involved at all stages. Extensive evidence synthesis was completed. Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation-II (AGREEII)-compliant processes were followed. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied across evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation and ultimately recommendation strength and diversity and inclusion were considered throughout.

Participants/ Materials, Setting, Methods

This summary should be read in conjunction with the full Guideline for detailed participants and methods. Governance included a six-continent international advisory and management committee, five guideline development groups, and paediatric, consumer, and translation committees. Extensive consumer engagement and guideline experts informed the update scope and priorities. Engaged international society-nominated panels included paediatrics, endocrinology, gynaecology, primary care, reproductive endocrinology, obstetrics, psychiatry, psychology, dietetics, exercise physiology, obesity care, public health and other experts, alongside consumers, project management, evidence synthesis, statisticians and translation experts. Thirty-nine professional and consumer organizations covering 71 countries engaged in the process. Twenty meetings and five face-to-face forums over 12 months addressed 58 prioritized clinical questions involving 52 systematic and 3 narrative reviews. Evidence-based recommendations were developed and approved via consensus across five guideline panels, modified based on international feedback and peer review, independently reviewed for methodological rigour, and approved by the Australian Government National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC).

Main Results and The Role Of Chance

The evidence in the assessment and management of PCOS has generally improved in the past five years, but remains of low to moderate quality. The technical evidence report and analyses (∼6000 pages) underpins 77 evidence-based and 54 consensus recommendations, with 123 practice points. Key updates include: i) further refinement of individual diagnostic criteria, a simplified diagnostic algorithm and inclusion of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels as an alternative to ultrasound in adults only; ii) strengthening recognition of broader features of PCOS including metabolic risk factors, cardiovascular disease, sleep apnea, very high prevalence of psychological features, and high risk status for adverse outcomes during pregnancy; iii) emphasizing the poorly recognized, diverse burden of disease and the need for greater healthcare professional education, evidence-based patient information, improved models of care and shared decision making to improve patient experience, alongside greater research; iv) maintained emphasis on healthy lifestyle, emotional wellbeing and quality of life, with awareness and consideration of weight stigma; and v) emphasizing evidence-based medical therapy and cheaper and safer fertility management.

Limitations, Reasons For Caution

Overall, recommendations are strengthened and evidence is improved, but remain generally low to moderate quality. Significantly greater research is now needed in this neglected, yet common condition. Regional health system variation was considered and acknowledged, with a further process for guideline and translation resource adaptation provided.

Wider Implications Of The Findings

The 2023 International Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS provides clinicians and patients with clear advice on best practice, based on the best available evidence, expert multidisciplinary input and consumer preferences. Research recommendations have been generated and a comprehensive multifaceted dissemination and translation programme supports the Guideline with an integrated evaluation program.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for polycystic ovary syndrome, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, ES 2013 guidelines recommend to consider making a presumptive diagnosis of PCOS in perimenopausal and menopausal patients with well-documented long-term history of oligomenorrhea and hyperandrogenism during the reproductive years. Look for the presence of polycystic ovarian morphology on ultrasound to provide additional supportive evidence, recognizing that this is less likely to present in menopausal patients.

- PCOS is the most common cause of hirsutism, with idiopathic hirsutism being the second most common

- hirsutism is not a diagnosis but a symptom/sign requiring evaluation for the underlying etiology. (high).

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) exercise intervention — Healthcare professionals and women could consider that there is a lack of evidence supporting any one type and intensity of exercise being better than another for anthropometric, metabolic, hormonal, reproductive or psychological outcomes. Any physical activity consistent with population guidelines will have health benefits and, within this, healthcare professionals should advise sustainable physical activity based on individual preferences and goals.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome [^115jZysg]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome is a heterogeneous endocrine disorder that affects about one in 15 women worldwide. The major endocrine disruption is excessive androgen secretion or activity, and a large proportion of women also have abnormal insulin activity. Many body systems are affected in polycystic ovary syndrome, resulting in several health complications, including menstrual dysfunction, infertility, hirsutism, acne, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Women with this disorder have an established increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and a still debated increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The diagnostic traits of polycystic ovary syndrome are hyperandrogenism, chronic anovulation, and polycystic ovaries, after exclusion of other conditions that cause these same features. A conclusive definition of the disorder and the importance of the three diagnostic criteria relative to each other remain controversial. The cause of polycystic ovary syndrome is unknown, but studies suggest a strong genetic component that is affected by gestational environment, lifestyle factors, or both.

### Positions statement: criteria for defining polycystic ovary syndrome as a predominantly hyperandrogenic syndrome: an androgen excess society guideline [^115EkaeM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The Androgen Excess Society (AES) charged a task force to review all available data and recommend an evidence-based definition for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), whether already in use or not, to guide clinical diagnosis and future research.

Participants

Participants included expert investigators in the field.

Evidence

Based on a systematic review of the published peer-reviewed medical literature, by querying MEDLINE databases, we tried to identify studies evaluating the epidemiology or phenotypic aspects of PCOS.

Consensus Process

The task force drafted the initial report, following a consensus process via electronic communication, which was then reviewed and critiqued by the AES Board of Directors. No section was finalized until all members were satisfied with the contents and minority opinions noted. Statements that were not supported by peer-reviewed evidence were not included.

Conclusions

Based on the available data, it is the view of the AES Task Force on the Phenotype of PCOS that there should be acceptance of the original 1990 National Institutes of Health criteria with some modifications, taking into consideration the concerns expressed in the proceedings of the 2003 Rotterdam conference. A principal conclusion was that PCOS should be first considered a disorder of androgen excess or hyperandrogenism, although a minority considered the possibility that there may be forms of PCOS without overt evidence of hyperandrogenism but recognized that more data are required before validating this supposition. Finally, the task force recognized, and fully expects, that the definition of this syndrome will evolve over time to incorporate new research findings.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American college of endocrinology, and androgen excess and pcos society disease state clinical review: guide to the best practices in the evaluation and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome – part 1 [^1166eTPA]. Endocrine Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is recognized as the most common endocrine disorder of reproductive-aged women around the world. This document, produced by the collaboration of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society (AES) aims to highlight the most important clinical issues confronting physicians and their patients with PCOS. It is a summary of current best practices in 2015. PCOS has been defined using various criteria, including menstrual irregularity, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM). General agreement exists among specialty society guidelines that the diagnosis of PCOS must be based on the presence of at least two of the following three criteria: chronic anovulation, hyperandrogenism (clinical or biological) and polycystic ovaries. There is need for careful clinical assessment of women's history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation, emphasizing the accuracy and validity of the methodology used for both biochemical measurements and ovarian imaging. Free testosterone (T) levels are more sensitive than the measurement of total T for establishing the existence of androgen excess and should be ideally determined through equilibrium dialysis techniques. Value of measuring levels of androgens other than T in patients with PCOS is relatively low. New ultrasound machines allow diagnosis of PCOM in patients having at least 25 small follicles (2 to 9 mm) in the whole ovary. Ovarian size at 10 mL remains the threshold between normal and increased ovary size. Serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone and anti-Müllerian hormone are useful for determining a diagnosis of PCOS. Correct diagnosis of PCOS impacts on the likelihood of associated metabolic and cardiovascular risks and leads to appropriate intervention, depending upon the woman's age, reproductive status, and her own concerns. The management of women with PCOS should include reproductive function, as well as the care of hirsutism, alopecia, and acne. Cycle length > 35 days suggests chronic anovulation, but cycle length slightly longer than normal (32 to 35 days) or slightly irregular (32 to 35–36 days) needs assessment for ovulatory dysfunction. Ovulatory dysfunction is associated with increased prevalence of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer, in addition to infertility. In PCOS, hirsutism develops gradually and intensifies with weight gain. In the neoplastic virilizing states, hirsutism is of rapid onset, usually associated with clitoromegaly and oligomenorrhea. Girls with severe acne or acne resistant to oral and topical agents, including isotretinoin (Accutane), may have a 40% likelihood of developing PCOS. Hair loss patterns are variable in women with hyperandrogenemia, typically the vertex, crown or diffuse pattern, whereas women with more severe hyperandrogenemia may see bitemporal hair loss and loss of the frontal hairline. Oral contraceptives (OCPs) can effectively lower androgens and block the effect of androgens via suppression of ovarian androgen production and by increasing sex hormone-binding globulin. Physiologic doses of dexamethasone or prednisone can directly lower adrenal androgen output. Anti-androgens can be used to block the effects of androgen in the pilosebaceous unit or in the hair follicle. Anti-androgen therapy works through competitive antagonism of the androgen receptor (spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, flutamide) or inhibition of 5α-reductase (finasteride) to prevent the conversion of T to its more potent form, 5α-dihydrotestosterone. The choice of antiandrogen therapy is guided by symptoms. The diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents is particularly challenging given significant age and developmental issues in this group. Management of infertility in women with PCOS requires an understanding of the pathophysiology of anovulation as well as currently available treatments. Many features of PCOS, including acne, menstrual irregularities, and hyperinsulinemia, are common in normal puberty. Menstrual irregularities with anovulatory cycles and varied cycle length are common due to the immaturity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis in the 2- to 3-year time period post-menarche. Persistent oligomenorrhea 2 to 3 years beyond menarche predicts ongoing menstrual irregularities and greater likelihood of underlying ovarian or adrenal dysfunction. In adolescent girls, large, multicystic ovaries are a common finding, so ultrasound is not a first-line investigation in women < 17 years of age. Ovarian dysfunction in adolescents should be based on oligomenorrhea and/or biochemical evidence of oligo/anovulation, but there are major limitations to the sensitivity of T assays in ranges applicable to young girls. Metformin is commonly used in young girls and adolescents with PCOS as first-line monotherapy or in combination with OCPs and anti-androgen medications. In lean adolescent girls, a dose as low as 850 mg daily may be effective at reducing PCOS symptoms; in overweight and obese adolescents, dose escalation to 1.5 to 2.5 g daily is likely required. Anti-androgen therapy in adolescents could affect bone mass, although available short-term data suggest no effect on bone loss.

Amsterdam ESHRE/ASRM PCOS consensus — this third consensus report summarizes current knowledge and knowledge gaps on women's health aspects of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), covering adolescence, hirsutism and acne, contraception, menstrual cycle abnormalities, quality of life, ethnicity, pregnancy complications, long-term metabolic and cardiovascular health, and malignancy and stroke risk. PCOS is described as the most common endocrine disorder in women, with prevalence between 6% and 10% using U.S. National Institutes of Health criteria and as high as 10% to 15% with Rotterdam criteria. PCOS is typically first identified during the early reproductive years, and clinical expression commonly includes oligo-ovulation or anovulation, hyperandrogenism (either clinical or biochemical), and the presence of polycystic ovaries. This work follows earlier ESHRE/ASRM workshops that focused on diagnosis (2004) and infertility management (2008).

Abstract

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy affecting 8%–13% of reproductive‐aged women. The aetiology of the syndrome is complex, with genetic susceptibility, androgen exposure in early life and adiposity related dysfunction leading to perturbance in hypothalamic–ovarian function. PCOS clinical features are heterogeneous, with manifestations arising even in early adolescence, developing into multisystem reproductive, metabolic and psychological manifestations in adulthood. In this review, we will discuss challenges in the diagnosis of PCOS and understanding of the natural history of PCOS.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — diagnostic algorithm (Figure 1): Step 1: Irregular cycles + clinical hyperandrogenism (exclude other causes*) = diagnosis. Step 2: If no clinical hyperandrogenism, test for biochemical hyperandrogenism (exclude other causes*) = diagnosis. Step 3: If ONLY irregular cycles OR hyperandrogenism, adolescents ultrasound is not indicated = consider at risk of PCOS and reassess later, and adults - request ultrasound for PCOM#, if positive (exclude other causes*) = diagnosis. The algorithm notes that PCOM = polycystic ovarian morphology on ultrasound and specifies exclusion of other causes = TSH, prolactin, 17-OH progesterone, FSH or if clinically indicated exclude other causes (e.g. Cushing's Syndrome, adrenal tumours); for hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, usually due to low body fat or intensive exercise, exclude clinically and with LH/FSH.

### Approach to the patient: diagnostic challenges in the workup for polycystic ovary syndrome [^112tnc1Q]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 10% to 13% of women globally. It is a condition with metabolic, reproductive, and psychological features, with health impacts across the lifespan. The etiology of PCOS is complex, with an interplay of several factors, including genetic and epigenetic susceptibility, androgen exposure in early life and adiposity-related dysfunction leading to hypothalamic-ovarian disturbance. Diagnosis is recommended based on the International PCOS Guideline criteria, with diagnosis confirmed in adults when 2 of out the following 3 criteria are met: (i) hyperandrogenism (clinical or biochemical); (ii) irregular cycles; and (iii) polycystic ovary morphology or elevated anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels. With its clinical heterogeneity, distinct phenotypes, variation across the lifespan and ethnic variation, PCOS diagnosis can present significant diagnostic challenges to clinicians.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome [^114NbQzh]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 5–18% of women, and is a reproductive, metabolic, and psychological condition with impacts across the lifespan. The cause is complex, and includes genetic and epigenetic susceptibility, hypothalamic and ovarian dysfunction, excess androgen exposure, insulin resistance, and adiposity-related mechanisms. Diagnosis is recommended based on the 2003 Rotterdam criteria and confirmed with two of three criteria: hyperandrogenism (clinical or biochemical), irregular cycles, and polycystic ovary morphology. In adolescents, both the criteria of hyperandrogenism and irregular cycles are needed, and ovarian morphology is not included due to poor specificity. The diagnostic criteria generates four phenotypes, and clinical features are heterogeneous, with manifestations typically arising in childhood and then evolving across adolescent and adult life. Treatment involves a combination of lifestyle alterations and medical management. Lifestyle optimisation includes a healthy balanced diet and regular exercise to prevent excess weight gain, limit PCOS complications and target weight reduction when needed. Medical management options include metformin to improve insulin resistance and metabolic features, combined oral contraceptive pill for menstrual cycle regulation and hyperandrogenism, and if needed, anti-androgens for refractory hyperandrogenism. In this Review, we provide an update on the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and clinical features of PCOS, and discuss the needs and priorities of those with PCOS, including lifestyle, and medical and infertility treatment. Further we discuss the status of international evidence-based guidelines (EBG) and translation, to support patient self management, healthcare provision, and to set research priorities.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^114He3Hn]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — metformin in pregnancy is presented as follows: Metformin could be considered in some circumstances (e.g., risk for preterm birth) to reduce preterm delivery and limit excess gestational weight gain, in pregnant women with PCOS. Women should be counselled that the consequences of metformin exposure on long- term offspring health remain unclear and there is a suggestion of increased childhood weight, although causality is not certain. Side effects of metformin are mostly mild, transient gastrointestinal symptoms and are not worse in pregnancy.

### Consensus on women's health aspects of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): the amsterdam ESHRE / ASRM-sponsored 3rd PCOS consensus workshop group [^114zyefQ]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — oral contraceptives (OCPs): Overall, the benefits of OCPs outweigh the risks in most patients with PCOS (level B), and in the absence of other risk factors there is no evidence that women with PCOS are at increased risk with OCPs compared with normal women (level C), although women with PCOS are more likely to have contraindications for OCP use than normal women (level C). There is no evidence for differences in effectiveness and risk among the various progestogens and when used in combination with a 20 versus a 30 μg daily dose of estrogen (level B), and subsequent fertility is not negatively affected by OCPs (level C); there is also no definitive evidence that the type of OCP determines efficacy of hirsutism control (level C). Evidence on metabolic effects is limited; a Cochrane review concluded that OCP use does not increase metabolic risk, and small studies suggest long-term OCP use either does not change or improves cardiometabolic risk parameters, while there are few randomized double-blind trials assessing these outcomes. Key research needs include that head-to-head blinded trials comparing different OCP strategies are lacking and that there is a lack of longitudinal follow-up studies after a course of OCPs.

### Anti-Müllerian hormone as a diagnostic biomarker for polycystic ovary syndrome and polycystic ovarian morphology: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111K1u9H]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Medium credibility.

Importance

As part of the 2023 international evidence-based polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) guideline, this meta-analysis investigated the inclusion of Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels in the diagnostic criteria for PCOS.

Objective

To answer the following three questions: 1) Are AMH levels effective in diagnosing PCOS in adult women? 2) Are AMH levels effective in diagnosing PCOS in adolescents? Are AMH levels effective in diagnosing polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM)?

Data Sources

Searches were conducted in six databases until July 31, 2023.

Study Selection and Synthesis

Eligible studies were those conducted in humans, published in English, and reporting sensitivity, specificity, and/or area under the curve values. Extracted data included study population, age, body mass index, AMH assay, cut-off value of AMH levels, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve values. The risk of bias was assessed using the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies tool. A random effects model was used to test diagnostic accuracy.

Main Outcomes

Pooled sensitivity and specificity to use AMH levels for PCOS diagnosis in adults as well as adolescents and for detecting PCOM in adults.

Results

Eighty-two studies were included. The adult AMH-PCOS meta-analyses (n = 68) showed a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76–0.82; I² = 86%) and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.84–0.89; I² = 91%). The adolescent AMH-PCOS meta-analysis (n = 11) showed a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.66 (95% CI, 0.58–0.73; I² = 74%) and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.71–0.83; I² = 45%). The adult AMH-PCOM meta-analysis (n = 7) showed a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.72–0.85; I² = 94%) and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.78–0.93; I² = 94%). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: This study investigated the most profound change in the 2023 international evidence-based PCOS guideline, which now recommends AMH levels for defining PCOM in adults in accordance with the diagnostic algorithm. Antimüllerian hormone levels alone are insufficient for PCOS diagnosis and are nonspecific for PCOM in adolescents. Multiple factors influence AMH levels and cause heterogeneity as well as limitations in this study. Consequently, no international cut-off value could be recommended, emphasizing the need for research on more individualized cut-off values.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114sxcpZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim was to formulate practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Participants

An Endocrine Society-appointed Task Force of experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer developed the guideline.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe both the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence.

Consensus Process

One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications enabled consensus. Committees and members of The Endocrine Society and the European Society of Endocrinology reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of these guidelines. Two systematic reviews were conducted to summarize supporting evidence.

Conclusions

We suggest using the Rotterdam criteria for diagnosing PCOS (presence of two of the following criteria: androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction, or polycystic ovaries). Establishing a diagnosis of PCOS is problematic in adolescents and menopausal women. Hyperandrogenism is central to the presentation in adolescents, whereas there is no consistent phenotype in postmenopausal women. Evaluation of women with PCOS should exclude alternate androgen-excess disorders and risk factors for endometrial cancer, mood disorders, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Hormonal contraceptives are the first-line management for menstrual abnormalities and hirsutism/acne in PCOS. Clomiphene is currently the first-line therapy for infertility; metformin is beneficial for metabolic/glycemic abnormalities and for improving menstrual irregularities, but it has limited or no benefit in treating hirsutism, acne, or infertility. Hormonal contraceptives and metformin are the treatment options in adolescents with PCOS. The role of weight loss in improving PCOS status per se is uncertain, but lifestyle intervention is beneficial in overweight/obese patients for other health benefits. Thiazolidinediones have an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio overall, and statins require further study.

### The diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome during adolescence [^1166ama1]. Hormone Research in Paediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for polycystic ovary syndrome, more specifically with respect to adolescent patients, diagnosis, AE-PCOS 2015 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to recommend any criteria to define polycystic ovary morphology in adolescent patients. Consider defining an ovarian volume > 12.0 cm³ (by formula for a prolate ellipsoid) as enlarged. Do not use follicle counts to define polycystic ovary morphology in adolescent patients.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American college of endocrinology, and androgen excess and pcos society disease state clinical review: guide to the best practices in the evaluation and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome-part 2 [^1175qogk]. Endocrine Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is recognized as the most common endocrine disorder of reproductive-aged women around the world. This document, produced by the collaboration of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the Androgen Excess Society aims to highlight the most important clinical issues confronting physicians and their patients with PCOS. It is a summary of current best practices in 2014. Insulin resistance is believed to play an intrinsic role in the pathogenesis of PCOS. The mechanism by which insulin resistance or insulin give rise to oligomenorrhea and hyperandrogenemia, however, is unclear. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies have shown that both obese and lean women with PCOS have some degree of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is implicated in the ovulatory dysfunction of PCOS by disrupting the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. Given the association with insulin resistance, all women with PCOS require evaluation for the risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and the possible risk of clinical events, including acute myocardial infarction and stroke. Obese women with PCOS are at increased risk for MetS with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; 31 to 35%) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM; 7.5 to 10%). Rates of progression from normal glucose tolerance to IGT, and in turn to T2DM, may be as high as 5 to 15% within 3 years. Data suggest the need for baseline oral glucose tolerance test every 1 to 2 years based on family history of T2DM as well as body mass index (BMI) and yearly in women with IGT. Compared with BMI- and age-matched controls, young, lean PCOS women have lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) size, higher very-low-density lipoprotein particle number, higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle number, and borderline lower LDL size. Statins have been shown to lower testosterone levels either alone or in combination with oral contraceptives (OCPs) but have not shown improvement in menses, spontaneous ovulation, hirsutism, or acne. Statins reduce total and LDL cholesterol but have no effect on HDL, C-reactive protein, fasting insulin, or homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance in PCOS women, in contrast to the general population. There have been no long-term studies of statins on clinical cardiac outcomes in women with PCOS. Coronary calcification is more prevalent and more severe in PCOS than in controls. In women under 60 years of age undergoing coronary angiography, the presence of polycystic ovaries on sonography has been associated with more arterial segments with > 50% stenosis, but the relationship between PCOS and actual cardiovascular events remains unclear. Therapies for PCOS are varied in their effects and targets and include both nonpharmacologic as well as pharmacologic approaches. Weight loss is the primary therapy in PCOS — reduction in weight of as little as 5% can restore regular menses and improve response to ovulation- inducing and fertility medications. Metformin in premenopausal PCOS women has been associated with a reduction in features of MetS. Clamp studies using ethinyl estradiol/drosperinone combination failed to reveal evidence of an increase in either peripheral or hepatic insulin resistance. Subjects with PCOS have a 1.5-times higher baseline risk of venous thromboembolic disease and a 3.7-fold greater effect with OCP use compared with non-PCOS subjects. There is currently no genetic test to screen for or diagnose PCOS, and there is no test to assist in the choice of treatment strategies. Persistent bleeding should always be investigated for pregnancy and/or uterine pathology — including transvaginal ultrasound exam and endometrial biopsy — in women with PCOS. PCOS women can have difficulty conceiving. Those who become pregnant are at risk for gestational diabetes (which should be evaluated and managed appropriately) and the microvascular complications of diabetes. Assessment of a woman with PCOS for infertility involves evaluating for preconceptional issues that may affect response to therapy or lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes and evaluating the couple for other common infertility issues that may affect the choice of therapy, such as a semen analysis. Women with PCOS have multiple factors that may lead to an elevated risk of pregnancy, including a high prevalence of IGT — a clear risk factor for gestational diabetes — and MetS with hypertension, which increases the risk for pre-eclampsia and placental abruption. Women should be screened and treated for hypertension and diabetes prior to attempting conception. Women should be counseled about weight loss prior to attempting conception, although there are limited clinical trial data demonstrating a benefit to this recommendation. Treatment for women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility should begin with an oral agent such as clomiphene citrate or letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor.

### Consensus on women's health aspects of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): the amsterdam ESHRE / ASRM-sponsored 3rd PCOS consensus workshop group [^117KpfYo]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — risks, outcomes, and management guidance — notes that women with PCOS who desire a pregnancy may be at increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes (level B), and babies born from women with PCOS may have increased morbidity and mortality (level B). Miscarriage rates are not increased in natural conceptions in women with PCOS, independent of obesity, and miscarriage rates after induction of ovulation mirror those found in other infertile populations (level A). During pregnancy, there is a higher incidence of gestational diabetes (GDM) (40% to 50%), gestational hypertensive disorders (5%), and birth of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) babies (10% to 15%), with associated fetal macrosomia. Women with PCOS should be observed closely during pregnancy as they may be at increased risk for the development of GDM, gestational hypertension, and associated complications (level B), and health should be optimized before conception with advice about smoking cessation, lifestyle, diet, and appropriate vitamin supplementation (e.g., folic acid) (GPP). Regarding metformin, the use of metformin for women with anovulatory PCOS has no benefit with respect to enhancing either fertility or live-birth rates, and its routine use is not recommended, and there is no evidence for improved live-birth rates or decreased pregnancy complications with the use of metformin either before conception or during pregnancy (level A). Pregnancy-associated risks are greater in women diagnosed by more classic (NIH) criteria as opposed to nonhyperandrogenic women (level B).

### The androgen excess and PCOS society criteria for the polycystic ovary syndrome: the complete task force report [^111ZtH1b]. Fertility and Sterility (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To review all available data and recommend a definition for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) based on published peer-reviewed data, whether already in use or not, to guide clinical diagnosis and future research.

Design

Literature review and expert consensus.

Setting

Professional society.

Patients

None.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

A systematic review of the published peer-reviewed medical literature, by querying MEDLINE databases, to identify studies evaluating the epidemiology or phenotypic aspects of PCOS.

Result(S)

The Task Force drafted the initial report, following a consensus process via electronic communication, which was then reviewed and critiqued by the Androgen Excess and PCOS (AE-PCOS) Society AE-PCOS Board of Directors. No section was finalized until all members were satisfied with the contents, and minority opinions noted. Statements were not included that were not supported by peer-reviewed evidence.

Conclusion(S)

Based on the available data, it is the view of the AE-PCOS Society Task Force that PCOS should be defined by the presence of hyperandrogenism (clinical and/or biochemical), ovarian dysfunction (oligo-anovulation and/or polycystic ovaries), and the exclusion of related disorders. However, a minority considered the possibility that there may be forms of PCOS without overt evidence of hyperandrogenism, but recognized that more data are required before validating this supposition. Finally, the Task Force recognized and fully expects that the definition of this syndrome will evolve over time to incorporate new research findings.

### Perspectives on polycystic ovary syndrome: is polycystic ovary syndrome research underfunded? [^115Z6msC]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine-metabolic abnormality with a worldwide prevalence of 4% to 21%, depending on diagnostic criteria. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the largest single funding agency in the world; it invests nearly $30.0 billion annually in biomedical research.

Evidence Acquisition

Using the NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting tool, we searched for all grants awarded by the NIH for PCOS and three other disorders with similar degrees of morbidity and similar or lower mortality and prevalence [rheumatoid arthritis (RA), tuberculosis (TB), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)].

Evidence Synthesis

We compared funding by the NIH for PCOS, RA, TB, and SLE research for the years 2006 to 2015, inclusive.

Conclusion

PCOS, compared with RA, TB, and SLE, was relatively less funded (total mean 10-year funding was $215.12 million vs $454.39 million, $773.77 million, and $609.52 million, respectively). Funding for PCOS was largely provided by one NIH Institute/Center (ICs) vs at least two ICs for SLE and RA; more individual Research Project Grants were awarded for RA, SLE, and TB than for PCOS, whereas PCOS funding was more likely to be through General Clinical Research Centers Program or Specialized Centers Program awards. Our data suggest that PCOS research may be underfunded considering its prevalence, economic burden, metabolic morbidity, and negative impact on quality of life. Greater education of NIH leaders, including those at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; other federal and state agency leads; elected leaders; and the general public by professional societies, the scientific community, and patient advocates regarding this disorder is needed.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex syndrome that affects menstrual regularity, causes hyperandrogenism, increases the risk of metabolic dysfunction and infertility, and is associated with higher rates of mental health disorders. The symptoms of PCOS are unique to each individual and will evolve throughout their reproductive lifespan and beyond. Thus, care should be personalized and provided by an appropriate team of multidisciplinary physicians and clinicians, such as dieticians and psychologists.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome as a metabolic disease [^117CpVuL]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous familial disorder affecting up to one in five women. The aetiology remains unclear, but available evidence suggests it is a polygenic disorder with epigenetic, developmental, and environmental components. The diagnostic criteria for PCOS are based on reproductive features, and the syndrome is categorized into several phenotypes that can vary by race and ethnicity. Insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction have a crucial role in the pathogenesis of the syndrome and contribute to many adverse metabolic outcomes that place a substantial burden on the health of women with PCOS across their lifespan. Metabolic abnormalities like those identified in women with PCOS are also present in their female and male first-degree relatives. Overall, more emphasis is required on defining PCOS as a metabolic disorder in addition to a reproductive one. This approach could affect the management and future treatment options for the syndrome. The rationale of the current review is to identify and analyse existing evidence for PCOS as a metabolic, as well as a reproductive, disease.

A better understanding of the different phenotypes and of their endocrine and metabolic characteristics permits investigators to distinguish three main androgen excess disorders: classic polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), mild ovulatory PCOS, and idiopathic hyperandrogenism. These androgenic phenotypes differ more for the severity of the endocrine and metabolic alteration than for the etiopathogenetic mechanisms. The appearance of a particular androgenic phenotype is determined by a sum of genetic and environmental factors, but mostly by body weight.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — after natural or assisted conception, the risk of miscarriage in PCOS is reported to be as high as 30% to 50%, and it has been suggested that the miscarriage rate is threefold higher in women with PCOS than in normal women. However, prospective randomized trials suggest the miscarriage rate is in the range of 15% to 25% and comparable with other subfertile populations.
