## Question

What is an effective controller medication for asthma?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what an effective controller medication for asthma is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the highest-credibility guidelines identify as the foundational controller class. Then, I should verify the efficacy hierarchy among controllers and when to escalate to combinations. Next, I need to check the evidence for as-needed ICS–formoterol and SMART strategies versus traditional daily ICS. After that, I will synthesize severity-specific recommendations and confirm where LAMA and LTRA fit. I should also review adherence and patient-centered factors that influence real-world effectiveness. Finally, I will validate these choices against comparative effectiveness data and outline a concise, stepwise implementation and monitoring plan [^112WXZFZ] [^111NPNLz].

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: across modern, high-credibility guidance, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the cornerstone controller therapy because they reduce airway inflammation, improve symptoms, and lower exacerbation risk across the severity spectrum, making ICS the preferred class on which most regimens are built [^112WXZFZ] [^116RJgLJ] [^111gzNiu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about all controller classes being equivalent in practice; I should distinguish categories and their roles. Low-dose ICS are first-line for mild persistent disease, while ICS–LABA combinations become the preferred maintenance for moderate to severe asthma when control is inadequate on ICS alone; LTRA are alternative second-line options for those who cannot or will not use ICS, and LAMA are add-on therapies when ICS–LABA fails to achieve control, each position supported by guideline algorithms and add-on data for tiotropium and single-inhaler triple therapy [^114nrzF9] [^113W2wX5] [^113azxef].

> Next, I should review novel reliever-controller strategies. As-needed low-dose ICS–formoterol (the AIR approach) reduces severe exacerbations and is guideline-endorsed for mild asthma and as part of MART/SMART in higher steps, often outperforming SABA-based reliever strategies while simplifying regimens; the NHLBI 2020 focused update supports ICS–formoterol in a single inhaler as both maintenance and reliever for moderate to severe persistent asthma and reduces exacerbation risk compared with higher-dose ICS plus SABA or same-dose ICS–LABA plus SABA [^111NPNLz] [^115EBeHa]. Wait, let me verify the evidence base I cite for "as-needed ICS" specifically; the Cochrane review I initially reached for focuses on digital adherence rather than anti-inflammatory reliever therapy, so I should instead rely on the dedicated as-needed ICS evidence summaries that show reduced exacerbations with ICS–formoterol or paired ICS use at symptom onset in mild asthma and practical implementation details for AIR and SMART/MART regimens [^1148QtHg] [^112h6GxW].

> I will now examine severity-specific recommendations to ensure the stepwise framework is consistent. For mild persistent asthma, preferred options are either daily low-dose ICS with a SABA reliever or as-needed low-dose ICS–formoterol, with multiple guidelines now prioritizing an ICS-containing reliever to minimize exacerbation risk from SABA-only strategies; for moderate disease, move to low- or medium-dose maintenance ICS–LABA or MART; for severe disease, use high-dose ICS–LABA and add LAMA, consider LTRA, and evaluate biologics for type 2–high phenotypes, with these steps integrated into both GINA and NHLBI algorithms and echoed by contemporary UK guidance for initial AIR and early MART in symptomatic presentations [^112h6GxW] [^116RJgLJ] [^113Waoay].

> Let me consider adherence and real-world implementation, because the "most effective" controller class on paper may underperform without a regimen patients can sustain. SMART/MART with budesonide–formoterol consistently reduces severe exacerbations versus comparators and often at lower total ICS exposure, improving adherence through regimen simplification; meta-analytic data corroborate lower exacerbation rates, and professional society guidance recommends SMART for adolescents and adults with moderate to severe persistent asthma, while patient barrier studies highlight nonadherence, medication beliefs, and technique issues as major drivers of suboptimal control that SMART can partially mitigate [^113qTweh] [^116ULioj] [^1169CcFF].

> I should double-check comparative effectiveness claims with broader syntheses. Network meta-analyses demonstrate that stepping from ICS to ICS–LABA reduces exacerbations by roughly one-third versus ICS alone, and LAMA add-on produces additional improvements in lung function and time to first severe exacerbation when ICS–LABA is insufficient, aligning with escalation pathways in guidelines and confirming the efficacy hierarchy across controller strategies [^112NjQXk] [^113W2wX5].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I briefly considered whether SABA-only might still be acceptable in truly mild, infrequent symptoms, but I need to ensure this reflects current standards; both GINA 2025 and BTS/NICE/SIGN recommend an ICS-containing reliever strategy from diagnosis to reduce severe exacerbation risk even in patients with low symptom burden, favoring as-needed low-dose ICS–formoterol for initial therapy where available and licensed [^115EBeHa] [^113Waoay].

> Next, I should review stepping down and safety since effectiveness also means minimizing treatment burden over time. Once control is stable for at least three months with good lung function, guidelines recommend stepping down ICS-containing therapy in measured increments while maintaining an anti-inflammatory reliever where appropriate; discontinuing LABA abruptly can worsen control, and the safest step-down generally involves reducing the ICS component by 25–50% with close follow-up and an action plan, avoiding complete cessation of ICS or LABA because that increases exacerbation risk [^113V7ZRi] [^116RJgLJ] [^11416gE4].

> Let me synthesize and state the answer clearly while I check that my claims align with the highest-credibility sources. The most effective controller medication class for asthma is inhaled corticosteroids, and for many patients the optimal, outcomes-focused formulation and strategy is an ICS-containing regimen that uses formoterol as both maintenance and reliever (SMART/MART) or, in mild disease, as-needed low-dose ICS–formoterol, given robust reductions in exacerbations and guideline endorsement; implement by initiating ICS-containing therapy in all persistent asthma, escalate to ICS–LABA if control is inadequate, add LAMA or consider biologics in severe disease, and leverage SMART to simplify and improve adherence, then step down cautiously once stable control is achieved [^116RJgLJ] [^111NPNLz] [^113qTweh].

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the preferred **first-line therapy** [^112WXZFZ] for persistent asthma; they reduce airway inflammation [^111uKEpJ], improve symptoms, and lower exacerbation risk [^112NjQXk] [^111QJSJM]. If control remains inadequate with ICS alone, add a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) to create an **ICS-LABA combination** [^111hgwgB], which further improves control [^111uKEpJ] and reduces exacerbations [^112NjQXk]. In moderate-to-severe asthma, **single maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART)** [^113qTweh] with ICS-formoterol is recommended [^111NPNLz] to reduce exacerbations [^116ULioj] and simplify treatment. Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) [^113azxef] or long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) [^113W2wX5] are alternatives or add-ons when ICS or ICS-LABA therapy is insufficient or not tolerated [^111uKEpJ]. Controller therapy should be **individualized** [^111uKEpJ] based on severity, control, and patient factors, with regular monitoring [^113V7ZRi] and **stepwise adjustment** [^112WXZFZ].

### Medical therapy for asthma: Updates from the NAEPP guidelines [^111QJSJM]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Proper care of patients with asthma involves the triad of systematic chronic care plans, self-management support, and appropriate medical therapy. Controller medications, such as inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta2 agonists, and leukotriene receptor antagonists, are the foundation of care for persistent asthma and should be taken daily on a long-term basis to achieve and maintain control of symptoms.

Inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred controller medication; studies have demonstrated that when inhaled corticosteroids are used consistently, they improve asthma control more effectively than any other single long-term control medication. Combining long-acting beta2 agonists and inhaled corticosteroids is effective and safe when inhaled corticosteroids alone are insufficient, and such combinations are an alternative to increasing the dosage of inhaled corticosteroids.

For patients with mild persistent asthma, leukotriene receptor antagonists are an alternative, second-line treatment option. They are easy to use, have high rates of compliance, and can provide good symptom control in many patients. Leukotriene receptor antagonists can also be used as an adjunctive therapy with inhaled corticosteroids, but for persons 12 years and older, the addition of long-acting beta2 agonists is preferred.

Inhaled short-acting beta2 agonists are the most effective therapy for rapid reversal of airflow obstruction and prompt relief of asthmatic symptoms. Increasing the use of short-acting beta2 agonists or using them more than two days per week or more than two nights per month generally indicates a need for additional therapy.

### Global initiative for asthma strategy 2021: Executive summary and rationale for key changes [^111uKEpJ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

- **Medications and strategies for symptom control and risk reduction**: Asthma medications are categorized as controllers, relievers, and add-on therapies:
	- **Controllers**: These contain inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), which reduce airway inflammation, control symptoms, and reduce the risks of exacerbations, even in mild asthma, as well as asthma-related deaths. Treatment with ICS may reduce exacerbation-related declines in lung function. "Maintenance" therapies are controllers prescribed for daily use.
	- **Relievers**: These include low-dose ICS–formoterol or short-acting beta-agonists (SABA) and contain rapid-onset bronchodilators. They are used "as needed" for quick relief of symptoms, including during exacerbations. Using ICS–formoterol as a reliever (often called an "antiinflammatory reliever" or "AIR") also reduces the risk of severe exacerbations, compared with a SABA reliever, both with or without maintenance controller treatment. SABA or ICS–formoterol is also recommended before exercise, if needed, to prevent exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.
	- **Add-on therapies**: These are mainly for patients with difficult-to-treat or severe asthma.

When choosing medications, consider local guidelines, regulatory approvals, and payer criteria.

### Optimizing asthma management: Role of long-acting muscarinic antagonists [^113W2wX5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Patients with asthma who are suboptimally responsive to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs) are frequently exposed to oral corticosteroids and high-dose ICS, which can lead to significant side effects. Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) have demonstrated efficacy and safety in a subset of these patients. This review summarizes the results of key studies using LAMAs in patients with asthma aged 12 years or older. LAMA as an add-on treatment improved lung function and asthma control in patients with uncontrolled asthma across studies. The efficacy of LAMAs as an add-on to ICS was superior to that of placebo and ICS dose escalation and comparable with that of LABAs. LAMA plus ICS plus LABA provided modest improvements in bronchodilation and increased the time to first severe exacerbation versus ICS plus LABA. Single-inhaler triple therapy was associated with decreased health care resource utilization and improved cost-effectiveness versus multiple inhalers. LAMAs were generally well tolerated; asthma exacerbations, bronchitis, and nasopharyngitis were common adverse events with LAMA in combination with ICS alone or ICS plus LABA. Thus, the overall evidence presented in this review supports the use of add-on LAMA treatment as a reasonable option in patients with asthma uncontrolled with ICS plus LABA or ICS alone.

Regarding medical management for severe asthma phenotypes, specifically with respect to ICSs and LABAs, the NHLBI 2020 guidelines recommend offering ICS-formoterol in a single inhaler used as both daily controller and reliever therapy in patients aged 12 years or older with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma rather than:

- **Higher-dose ICS**: As daily controller therapy and short-acting β-agonist for quick-relief therapy.

- **Same-dose ICS-LABA**: As daily controller therapy and short-acting β-agonist for quick-relief therapy.

### Inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2-agonist pharmacological profiles: Effective asthma therapy in practice [^111hgwgB]. Respiratory Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Fixed-dose combinations of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) and long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs) have been used to manage asthma for several years. They are the preferred therapy option for patients who do not achieve optimal control of their asthma with low-dose ICS monotherapy. In Europe, four ICS/LABA products are commercially available for asthma maintenance therapy: fluticasone propionate/formoterol fumarate, fluticasone propionate/salmeterol xinafoate, budesonide/formoterol fumarate, and beclometasone dipropionate/formoterol fumarate. Other combinations are likely to be developed over the next few years, such as mometasone/formoterol fumarate, fluticasone furoate/vilanterol, and mometasone/indacaterol.

Data from randomized, controlled clinical trials do not demonstrate a clear overall efficacy difference among ICS/LABA combinations approved for asthma therapy. Conversely, pharmacological data indicate that there may be certain advantages to using one ICS or LABA over another due to the specific pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles associated with particular treatments.

This review article summarizes the pharmacological characteristics of the various ICSs and LABAs available for the treatment of asthma, including the potential for ICS and LABA synergy. It also provides insight into the rationale for the development of the latest ICS/LABA combination approved for asthma maintenance therapy.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112WXZFZ]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for asthma, particularly concerning the initial assessment, the GINA 2025 guidelines recommend evaluating symptom control, the future risk of adverse outcomes, and treatment issues in adult, adolescent, and pediatric patients (aged 6–11 years) presenting with asthma:

- **Assess symptom control**: Review symptoms over the last 4 weeks or longer.

- **Identify risk factors**: Look for other risk factors for exacerbations, persistent airflow limitation, or side effects.

- **Measure lung function**: Conduct tests at diagnosis/initiation of treatment, 3–6 months after starting ICS-containing treatment, and periodically thereafter (at least once every 1–2 years), more frequently in at-risk patients and those with severe asthma.

- **Document treatment step**: Record the patient's treatment step.

- **Monitor inhaler technique**: Evaluate inhaler technique, adherence, and side effects.

- **Verify asthma action plan**: Ensure the patient has a written asthma action plan.

- **Discuss attitudes and goals**: Inquire about the patient's attitudes towards asthma and medications and their goals.

- **Assess multimorbidity**: Evaluate conditions contributing to symptoms and poor quality of life, and sometimes poor asthma control, such as rhinitis, rhinosinusitis, GERD, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, depression, and anxiety.

### Chronic asthma treatment: Common questions and answers [^113azxef]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Asthma affects more than 25 million people in the United States, and 62% of adults with asthma do not have adequately controlled symptoms. Asthma severity and level of control should be assessed at diagnosis and evaluated at subsequent visits using validated tools such as the Asthma Control Test or the asthma APGAR (activities, persistent, triggers, asthma medications, response to therapy) tools. Short-acting beta2 agonists are preferred asthma reliever medications. Controller medications consist of inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta2 agonists, long-acting muscarinic antagonists, and leukotriene receptor antagonists. Treatment typically begins with inhaled corticosteroids, and additional medications or dosage increases should be added in a stepwise fashion according to guideline-directed therapy recommendations from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program or the Global Initiative for Asthma when symptoms are inadequately controlled. Single maintenance and reliever therapy combines an inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta2 agonist for controller and reliever treatments. This therapy is preferred for adults and adolescents because of its effectiveness in reducing severe exacerbations.

- **Subcutaneous versus sublingual immunotherapy**: Subcutaneous immunotherapy may be considered for individuals five years and older with mild to moderate allergic asthma; however, sublingual immunotherapy is not recommended.

Patients with severe uncontrolled asthma despite appropriate treatment should be reassessed and considered for specialty referral. Biologic agents may be considered for patients with severe allergic and…

### Patients' perspective of barriers and facilitators to taking long-term controller medication for asthma: A novel taxonomy [^1169CcFF]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Within this domain, we classified barriers and matching facilitators related to patients' beliefs, perceptions, fears, and knowledge. The belief that their asthma is not serious was reported by patients who refrained from taking their medication because they disregarded the importance of their symptoms and often did not recognize asthma as a chronic condition that needed to be controlled to prevent short-term events and long-term sequelae. Fears of addiction or dependence on their medication were raised by patients who expressed concerns about becoming dependent on medication. Similarly, some patients mentioned the belief of decreasing effectiveness of the medication over time, as they assumed that daily use of medication would lead to a need for increased dosage in the future. None of these three barriers were matched by any facilitator.

The perception that medication should be used in response to symptoms, and not on a regular basis, translated into patients' intake of medication solely when experiencing symptoms, with discontinuation when symptoms abated. In contrast, the perception that self-management should be used in anticipation of triggers was a facilitator reported by patients who understood the disease as a chronic condition, accepted the need for long-term use of medication, and knew how to increase the dosage of medications in anticipation of potential triggers that could result in an asthma flare-up or exacerbation.

Another barrier was inadequate or limited knowledge about their medication, reported by patients who were unsure about their medication regimens.

### Long-term control medication use and asthma control status among children and adults with asthma [^113NihEv]. The Journal of Asthma (2017). Low credibility.

Uncontrolled asthma decreases quality of life and increases health care use. Most people with asthma need daily use of long-term control (LTC) medications to manage asthma symptoms and prevent asthma attacks. Ongoing assessment of a person's level of asthma control and medication use is crucial in determining the effectiveness of treatment to decrease the frequency and intensity of symptoms and functional limitations.

- **Objective**: To assess the use of LTC medication among children and adults with asthma and identify contributing factors for LTC medication use.

- **Methods**: We used the 2006–2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) child and adult Asthma Call-back Survey (ACBS) data to assess the level of asthma control and LTC medication use. Asthma control was classified as well controlled or uncontrolled using guideline-based measures. We used multivariable logistic regression models to identify contributing factors for LTC medication use and having uncontrolled asthma.

- **Results**: Among persons with asthma, 46.0% of children and 41.5% of adults were taking LTC medications, and 38.4% of children and 50.0% of adults had uncontrolled asthma. Among children with uncontrolled asthma (38.4%), 24.1% were taking LTC medications and 14.3% were not taking LTC medications. Among adults with uncontrolled asthma (50.0%), 26.7% were taking LTC medications and 23.3% were not taking LTC medications.

- **Conclusions**: Using BRFSS ACBS data to assess the level of asthma control and LTC medication use can identify subpopulations of persons with.

### Acute asthma exacerbations: Management strategies [^116ULioj]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, specifically in adjusting treatment and stepping up, the AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend the initiation of single maintenance and reliever therapy with an ICS-LABA. This approach aims to reduce the risk of exacerbations in patients aged ≥ 12 years with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma. It is also advised to consider initiating single maintenance and reliever therapy in pediatric patients aged ≥ 4 years with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma.

### Digital interventions to improve adherence to maintenance medication in asthma [^111dGfZD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Asthma is the most common chronic lung condition worldwide, affecting 334 million adults and children globally. Despite the availability of effective treatment, such as inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), adherence to maintenance medication remains suboptimal. Poor ICS adherence leads to increased asthma symptoms, exacerbations, hospitalizations, and healthcare utilization. Importantly, suboptimal use of asthma medication is a key contributor to asthma deaths. The impact of digital interventions on adherence and asthma outcomes is unknown.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness of digital interventions for improving adherence to maintenance treatments in asthma.

- **Search methods**: We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, which contains studies identified through multiple electronic searches and hand searches of other sources. We also searched trial registries and reference lists of primary studies. We conducted the most recent searches on 1 June 2020, with no restrictions on the language of publication. A further search was run in October 2021, but studies were not fully incorporated.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including cluster- and quasi-randomized trials of any duration in any setting, comparing a digital adherence intervention with a non-digital adherence intervention or usual care. We included adults and children with a clinical diagnosis of asthma, receiving maintenance treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures for data collection. We used GRADE to assess.

### The disease management approach to controlling asthma [^114XYDe7]. Respiratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Asthma has become an important public health issue worldwide, and certain groups, such as children, are at particular risk of the disease. Often, asthma remains under-diagnosed and under-treated. Despite these worrying trends, the disease management approach to asthma control can help most asthma patients achieve a "normal" way of life. The increased prevalence and greater diagnostic awareness of asthma have placed increased demands on healthcare resources, but effective asthma control can minimize the personal, social, and economic burdens of the condition.

Early diagnosis and immediate anti-inflammatory treatment is the first step in gaining control of symptoms. A stepwise approach is then used to classify asthma severity and treatment, with the number and frequency of medications increasing (step up) as asthma severity increases and decreasing (step down) when asthma is under control. This stepwise approach to asthma management necessitates regular review of treatment once asthma is under control. However, effective asthma management depends on successful patient education, adherence to prescribed medication, and good doctor-patient partnerships.

Treatment guidelines recommend the use of a written asthma management plan that should be agreed upon between the doctor and patient. These plans should cover all aspects of asthma treatment, including prevention steps for long-term control and action steps to stop attacks once a worsening in asthma has been recognized. This comprehensive approach to asthma management increases the likelihood of achieving asthma control.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^116FcjFQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

Ultimately, broad change in clinical practice depends on the uptake, adoption, and implementation of clinical practice recommendations by primary care providers, with input from people who have asthma and their families, as well as support from healthcare systems. This update can serve as a basis to disseminate and facilitate adoption of the asthma recommendations at all levels and to ensure optimal care and equitable outcomes for all individuals with asthma. We ask for the assistance of every stakeholder in reaching our goal: improving asthma care and the quality of life of every person with asthma.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^111gzNiu]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Summary of the evidence:

The Expert Panel specified three critical outcomes (exacerbations, asthma control, and quality of life) and one important outcome (rescue medication use) for this question. The summary of evidence for Recommendation 9 is in EtD Table XIII in Appendix B.

Three RCTs with high certainty of evidence compared SABA alone to intermittent ICS with SABA for quick relief. This treatment resulted in a 33% relative risk (RR) reduction in exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids. Two of these three trials assessed growth but found different effects on this outcome. Ducharme et al. found a 5% lower gain in height and weight in study participants receiving intermittent fluticasone (750 μg twice daily at onset of a respiratory tract infection for up to 10 days) than in participants receiving a placebo. The authors noted a significant correlation between the cumulative dose of fluticasone and changes in height. In contrast, Bacharier et al. did not find an effect on linear growth of budesonide inhalation suspension (1 mg twice daily for 7 days) in comparison with placebo in children with an "identified respiratory tract illness". Whether these differences in growth effects were due to differences in drugs, doses, duration of treatment, or other factors is not clear.

Rationale and discussion:

The main comparator for which data are available is SABA-only therapy. The demonstrated efficacy but conflicting data regarding the effect of a short course of a daily ICS with SABA for quick-relief therapy on growth led the Expert Panel to develop a conditional recommendation.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^111NVwZX]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

Considering the overall balance between benefits and harms, the Expert Panel judged the SCIT recommendation to be conditional. Individuals may consider SCIT as adjunct therapy if they have the following characteristics:

- **Place a high value on small improvements**: Emphasis on quality of life and symptom control.
- **Place a high value on reducing medication use**: Desire to lower long-term and/or quick-relief medication use.
- **Place a lower value on potential reactions**: Willingness to accept the potential for systemic reactions of varying severity.

The studies available for evaluation tended to have small samples, and study reports did not characterize the races of participants or the social determinants of health they experienced. Studies of SCIT used different protocols, lacked standardized formulations, and did not have a uniform or standardized duration of follow-up. The efficacy of SCIT, which bears an acceptable burden of harms, is based on its impact on asthma quality of life and asthma-related symptoms, with low certainty of evidence. Whether to use SCIT should be a shared decision between the individual and the health care provider, considering the individual's asthma severity and willingness to accept the potential harms related to SCIT. Clinicians should administer SCIT in a clinical setting with the capacity to monitor and treat reactions.

The enthusiasm of the Expert Panel for recommending SCIT for allergic asthma management is reduced by the slight risk of harms and variability in access (due to costs and geographical location). This variability in access can promote health inequities.

### Asthma yardstick: Practical recommendations for a sustained step-up in asthma therapy for poorly controlled asthma [^113CdJX3]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Asthma guidelines recommend a control-based approach to management that involves assessment of impairment and risk, followed by implementation of treatment strategies individualized according to the patient's needs and preferences. The fact that many patients still experience severe symptoms that negatively affect quality of life suggests that asthma control remains an objective to be achieved. Tools are available to help patients (and families) manage the day-to-day and short-term variability in asthma symptoms; however, when and how to implement a sustained step-up in therapy is less clear. The Asthma Yardstick is a comprehensive update on how to conduct a sustained step-up in asthma therapy for the patient with not well-controlled or poorly controlled asthma. Patient profiles and step-up strategies are based on guidelines, newer data, and the authors' combined clinical experience and are intended to provide a practical and clinically meaningful guide toward the goal of well-controlled asthma for every patient. The development of this tool comes in response to the continued need to proactively address the sustained loss of asthma control at all levels of severity.

### Stopping long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) for adults with asthma well controlled by LABA and inhaled corticosteroids [^115yhppk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

Poorly controlled asthma often leads to preventable exacerbations that require additional medications, as well as unscheduled hospital and clinic visits. Long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) are commonly given to adults with asthma whose symptoms are not well controlled by inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). US and UK regulators have issued warnings for LABA in asthma and now recommend they be used "for the shortest duration of time required to achieve control of asthma symptoms and discontinued, if possible, once asthma control is achieved".

- **Objectives**: To compare cessation of long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) versus continued use of LABA/inhaled corticosteroids (LABA/ICS) for adults whose asthma is well controlled, and to determine whether stopping LABA:
	1. Results in loss of asthma control or deterioration in quality of life;
	2. Increases the likelihood of asthma attacks or 'exacerbations'; or
	3. Increases or decreases the likelihood of serious adverse events of any cause.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (CAGR), www. ClinicalTrials.gov, www.who.int/ictrp/en/, reference lists of primary studies, existing reviews, and manufacturers' trial registries (GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and AstraZeneca). We searched all databases from their inception to April 2015 and imposed no restriction on language of publication.

- **Selection criteria**: We looked for parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least eight weeks' duration, in which adults whose asthma was well controlled by any dose of ICS+LABA combination therapy were randomly assigned.

### BTS/NICE/SIGN joint guideline on asthma: Diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (November 2024) - summary of recommendations [^111tJcSz]. Thorax (2025). Low credibility.

These recommendations apply to individuals aged 12 and over who are on the treatment pathway recommended by previous NICE and BTS/SIGN guidelines.

- **Transferring from other treatment pathways**: Change treatment for people with confirmed asthma who are currently using a short-acting beta 2 agonist (SABA) only to a low-dose ICS/formoterol combination inhaler used as needed (as-needed AIR therapy).

- **For asthma not controlled on current regimens**:
	- Consider changing treatment to low-dose MART for patients not controlled on:
		- Regular low-dose ICS plus SABA as needed
		- Regular low-dose ICS/LABA combination inhaler plus SABA as needed
		- Regular low-dose ICS and supplementary therapy (LTRA) plus SABA as needed
		- Regular low-dose ICS/LABA combination inhaler and supplementary therapy (LTRA) plus SABA as needed.

	- Consider changing treatment to moderate-dose MART for patients not controlled on:
		- Regular moderate-dose ICS plus SABA as needed
		- Regular moderate-dose ICS/LABA combination inhaler plus SABA as needed
		- Regular moderate-dose ICS and supplementary therapy (LTRA or LAMA, or both) plus SABA as needed
		- Regular moderate-dose ICS/LABA combination inhaler and supplementary therapy (LTRA or LAMA, or both) plus SABA as needed.

- **Considerations for MART transition**: When changing from low- or moderate-dose ICS (or ICS/LABA combination inhaler) plus supplementary therapy to MART, assess whether to stop or continue the supplementary therapy based on the degree of benefit achieved when first introduced.

### Is asthma control more than just an absence of symptoms? An expert consensus statement [^111mbunn]. Respiratory Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to progress towards a consensus definition of asthma control and evaluate the disparities between healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patient perspectives. Definitions and measures of asthma control used in clinical trials and clinical practice vary considerably. There is also misalignment between patients and HCPs in understanding and managing asthma control.

A two-stage Delphi questionnaire involving asthma specialists was conducted to identify areas of consensus on aspects of asthma control in clinical practice. The results were compared with those of a structured literature review to assess if existing guidance and measures of asthma control used in studies correlated with practice. Eighty-two panelists participated in the Delphi questionnaire. The structured literature review included 185 manuscripts and 31 abstracts.

Panelists agreed that there was no standard definition of asthma control, confirmed by the identification of 19 different composite consensus/guideline definitions and/or validated measures of control across the Delphi study and literature review. While panelists agreed on the positive associations of well-controlled asthma with patient outcomes, there was no consensus on the components or thresholds for a working definition of control.

A universally accepted definition and measure of asthma control that is utilized and understood by patients, HCPs, and researchers is required.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111ocp5s]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for asthma, specifically in relation to avoiding exacerbating medications, the GINA 2025 guidelines recommend deciding on prescribing oral or ophthalmic β-blockers on a case-by-case basis. Treatment should be initiated under the close supervision of a specialist.

### A proposed revision of the stepwise treatment algorithm in asthma [^111sZBzt]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The stepwise approach to the pharmacologic treatment of asthma is a core foundation of asthma guidelines. Through this approach, treatment intensity is increased in discrete steps to obtain symptom control and reduce exacerbation risk and is decreased following a period of prolonged control. The stepwise approach is usually shown by an algorithm, as illustrated in the 2020 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) strategy update (Figure 1). Here, we review the 2020 GINA stepwise algorithm and suggest alternative evidence-based algorithms that address potential problems with the currently recommended approach.

### Comparative effectiveness of long term drug treatment strategies to prevent asthma exacerbations: Network meta-analysis [^112NjQXk]. BMJ (2014). High credibility.

- **Methods: Systematic review and data extraction**: To identify randomised controlled trials, we assessed all Cochrane systematic reviews on chronic asthma published before 1 August 2011 and selected the 16 focused on drug interventions in adults. We evaluated all studies included in these reviews, as well as those listed as having been rejected by the Cochrane authors. An update search for all reviews was conducted using identical search terms reported in these reviews. This search was performed on 1 August 2013 in the Cochrane Airways Group register of trials, which includes trials on asthma in Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. We screened all references of included reports for eligible trials.

Eligible reports were full-text randomised controlled trials lasting at least 24 weeks, comparing different drug strategies for the maintenance treatment of asthma in adults and reporting on exacerbations. No restrictions were applied on language or publication date. For an intervention to be included in the analysis, it had to be evaluated in at least two separate trials.

One investigator removed all reports that were not full-text publications and those on interventions lasting less than 24 weeks. Two investigators independently assessed all remaining reports based on title and abstract. The full text of these reports was evaluated against the inclusion criteria. Two investigators (RL and JC) used standardised forms to independently extract data on the characteristics of publication, patients, intervention, outcomes, and risk.

### The risks, benefits, and uncertainties of stepping down asthma medications [^11381pRD]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Stepwise adjustments have been suggested as a framework to manage chronic asthma over time. In this framework, individuals with good asthma control and a low risk for future asthma exacerbations may be considered for a reduction or "step down" of their chronic asthma medications. In this article, we discuss how patients may benefit or be harmed by stepping down asthma medications. Based on the literature presented in this article, we recommend that clinicians discuss the option of stepping down with patients when symptoms are stable, lung function is near normal, and biomarkers (if measured) are near normal. Other factors that should be considered in the decision to step down include the length of asthma stability, age of the patient, time of year, and patient preferences.

Reducing the dose of inhaled corticosteroid by 25% to 50% appears to be the safest method of stepping down. A clear plan of care and follow-up is needed when stepping down asthma medications because many patients are likely to have re-exacerbations.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^1144behQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Recommendations for the use of intermittent ICS in the treatment of asthma:

Scheduled, daily ICS treatment is the currently preferred pharmacologic controller therapy for persistent asthma in individuals of all ages. Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (EPR-3), published in 2007, suggested that intermittent ICS dosing schedules may be useful in some settings, but the evidence at that time was insufficient to support a recommendation in favor of this treatment beyond a recommendation based on expert consensus.

- **Definitions of terms used in this section**: "Intermittent" ICS dosing includes courses of ICS treatment used for brief periods, usually in response to symptoms or as an add-on with or without a LABA. "Intermittent ICS dosing" does not refer to a single regimen, and its definition is specified in each of the recommendations. This dosing allows providers to prescribe specific doses, frequencies, and durations of ICS use. The decision to use intermittent ICS dosing could depend on an individual's need, also known as "as-needed" or "pro re nata" dosing, a predefined index showing worsening asthma, or some other predefined criterion.

- **Controller therapy**: This refers to medications that are taken daily on a long-term basis to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma. Both controller therapy and intermittent dosing may involve the daily use of a specific dose of an ICS. The terms "ICS-LABA" (inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta 2-agonist combination) are used in this context.

### Individualized asthma self-management improves medication adherence and markers of asthma control [^1171EpWs]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Adherence to inhaled anti-inflammatory therapy and self-management skills are essential parts of the asthma treatment plan to improve asthma control and prevent exacerbations. Whether self-management education improves long-term medication adherence is less clear.

- **Objective**: A 24-week prospective, randomized controlled trial was performed to study the effect of self-management education on long-term adherence to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy and markers of asthma control.

- **Methods**: After stabilization on ICS medication during a run-in phase, 95 adults with moderate-to-severe asthma were recruited from a large metropolitan community; 84 were randomized to individualized self-management education, including self-monitoring of symptoms and peak flow, or usual care with self-monitoring alone. The key components of the 30-minute intervention were asthma information, assessment, and correction of inhaler technique; an individualized action plan based on self-monitoring data; and environmental control strategies for relevant allergen and irritant exposures. The intervention was personalized based on pulmonary function, allergen skin test reactivity, and inhaler technique and reinforced at 2-week intervals.

- **Results**: Participants randomized to the self-management intervention maintained consistently higher ICS adherence levels and showed a 9-fold greater odds of more than 60% adherence to the prescribed dose compared with control subjects at the end of the intervention (P = .02), and maintained a 3-fold greater odds of higher than 60% adherence at the end of the trial.

### Global initiative for asthma strategy 2021: Executive summary and rationale for key changes [^111LZyUb]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Asthma control is defined as the extent to which the features of asthma are apparent or have been reduced or eliminated by controller treatment. Assess asthma control within two domains: symptom control and risk of adverse outcomes, particularly exacerbations.

- **Symptom control**: Assess symptom control from asthma-related symptom frequency, night waking, and activity limitation. For patients using short-acting β2-agonist (SABA) reliever, also assess the frequency of SABA use. Other symptom control tools include the Asthma Control Test and the Asthma Control Questionnaire (preferably the five-item version).

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116RJgLJ]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, specifically with respect to treatment adjustment and stepping down, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend offering the following options:

- **Step 5. High-dose ICS-LABA plus oral corticosteroids**: Add biologic therapy in cases of type 2-high severe asthma if eligible and reduce oral corticosteroids; optimize inhaled therapy and reduce oral corticosteroid dose; use a sputum-guided approach to reducing oral corticosteroids; switch to alternate-day dosing for low-dose oral corticosteroids.

- **Step 5. Biologic therapy plus high-dose ICS-LABA**: Discontinue other add-on medications, especially oral corticosteroids, then consider reducing the inhaled corticosteroid-long-acting β-agonist dose.

- **Step 4. Moderate-to-high-dose ICS-LABA maintenance treatment**: Continue combination ICS-LABA with a 50% reduction in the ICS component by using available formulations; recognize that discontinuing LABA may lead to deterioration; switch to maintenance and reliever therapy with ICS-formoterol, with a lower maintenance dose.

- **Step 4. Medium-dose ICS-formoterol as maintenance and reliever**: Reduce maintenance ICS-formoterol to a low dose and continue as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol reliever.

- **Step 4. High-dose ICS plus second controller**: Reduce the ICS dose by 50% and continue the second controller.

- **Step 3. Low-dose ICS-LABA maintenance**: Reduce ICS-LABA to once daily; recognize that discontinuing LABA may lead to deterioration.

- **Step 3. Low-dose ICS-formoterol as maintenance and reliever**: Reduce the maintenance dose.

### Patients' perspective of barriers and facilitators to taking long-term controller medication for asthma: A novel taxonomy [^115x43kF]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Nearly 60% of patients with persistent asthma have suboptimal asthma control, a figure that has remained unchanged since 2000 in Canada and abroad. Suboptimal asthma control is associated with preventable asthma symptoms, overuse of bronchodilators (i.e. rescue medication), functional impairment (e.g. work absenteeism), increased health service use (e.g. emergency visits), and even death. The goal of asthma management is to control the disease so that patients may lead a normal, active life and prevent long-term impairment. Through guided self-management plans, patients learn to manage their asthma under the recommendations of their physician. The cornerstone of asthma management in individuals with persistent asthma is the daily use of long-term controller medication for the disease, most notably, inhaled corticosteroids. Unfortunately, adherence to recommended medications remains very low and is recognized as the main cause of therapeutic failure and preventable asthma morbidity.

### Association of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β-agonists as controller and quick relief therapy with exacerbations and symptom control in persistent asthma: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113qTweh]. JAMA (2018). Low credibility.

Combined use of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β-agonists (LABAs) as the controller and the quick relief therapy, termed single maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART), is a potential therapeutic regimen for the management of persistent asthma.

The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the effects of SMART in patients with persistent asthma.

Data sources and study selection were conducted by searching databases such as MEDLINE via OVID, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, from inception through August 2016 and updated through November 28, 2017. Two reviewers selected randomized clinical trials or observational studies that evaluated SMART versus inhaled corticosteroids with or without a LABA as the controller therapy, and short-acting β-agonists as the relief therapy for patients aged 5 years or older with persistent asthma, while reporting on an outcome of interest.

Meta-analyses were conducted using a random-effects model to calculate risk ratios (RRs), risk differences (RDs), and mean differences with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Citation screening, data abstraction, risk assessment, and strength of evidence grading were completed by two independent reviewers.

The main outcome measure was asthma exacerbations. The results from the analyses included 16 randomized clinical trials (N = 22,748 patients), 15 of which evaluated SMART as a combination therapy with budesonide and formoterol in a dry-powder inhaler among patients aged 12 years or older (n = 22,524).

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115EBeHa]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of asthma, specifically with respect to exacerbation management in the primary care setting, the GINA 2025 guidelines recommend the following: Counsel patients who are receiving maintenance inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing medication along with as-needed short-acting β-agonists to increase the maintenance dose of ICS or ICS-long-acting muscarinic antagonist (ICS-LAMA) for the next 2–4 weeks. Initiate ICS-containing therapy in patients not currently taking controller medication to reduce the risk of further exacerbations.

### BTS/NICE/SIGN joint guideline on asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (November 2024) - summary of recommendations [^116cTeuf]. Thorax (2025). Low credibility.

Pharmacological management in children aged 5 to 11 is crucial for effective asthma control. The guideline provides detailed recommendations for the management of children in this age group.

- **Initial management in children aged 5 to 11**: Offer a twice-daily pediatric low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), with a short-acting beta 2 agonist (SABA) as needed, as initial treatment for children aged 5 to 11 years with newly diagnosed asthma [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024].

- **Medicine combination and sequencing in children aged 5 to 11**:
	- **MART pathway**: Consider pediatric low-dose MART for children with asthma that is not controlled on pediatric low-dose ICS plus SABA as needed, as long as they are assessed to have the ability to manage a MART regimen [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024]. In November 2024, no asthma inhalers were licensed for MART in children under 12, so this use would be off-label. The evidence supporting the use of MART in children aged 5 to 11 is based on the use of a dry powder inhaler.
	- Consider increasing to pediatric moderate-dose MART if asthma is not controlled on pediatric low-dose MART [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024].

	- **Conventional pathway**: Consider adding a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) to twice-daily pediatric low-dose ICS plus SABA as needed when a child is assessed as unable to manage the MART regimen. Give the LTRA for a trial period of 8 to 12 weeks (unless there are side effects), then stop it if it is ineffective [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024].

### Post hoc analysis of initial treatments and control status in the initial study: An observational study of newly diagnosed patients with asthma [^111oebUu]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Two pivotal long-term goals of asthma management are symptom control and risk reduction. Evaluation of symptom control constitutes the basis of treatment decisions in a continuous asthma management cycle composed of assessment, treatment adjustment, and response review recommended by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA). Criteria used to assess clinical control have evolved from a combination of symptoms and lung function, such as peak expiratory flow (PEF) or forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), endorsed by GINA 2012, to symptoms alone in GINA 2014 and subsequent GINA updates. The removal of lung function from the assessment of asthma control is based on the rationale that although still important in predicting risk of exacerbations, lung function testing results, i.e. spirometry, sometimes provide equivocal or even little utility for determining the level of clinical control. Valid tools that can be used to assess symptom control include simple screening tools (e.g. the 4-item questionnaires endorsed by GINA), categorical symptom control tools (e.g. Royal College of Physicians Three Questions' Tool), and numerical tools (e.g. Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ]).

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), with or without long-acting β2 agonist (LABA), have been recommended by GINA as the mainstay initial controller treatment, and leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) may be considered as an alternative option or add-on medication at steps 2 to 4. LTRA belongs to anti-leukotrienes and renders anti-inflammatory as well as bronchodilating effects via inhibiting leukotriene receptors.

### The pediatric asthma yardstick: Practical recommendations for a sustained step-up in asthma therapy for children with inadequately controlled asthma [^112PixgH]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Asthma guidelines recommend a control-based approach to management, involving the assessment of impairment and risk, followed by implementation of treatment strategies individualized according to the patient's needs and preferences. However, for children with asthma, achieving control can be elusive. Although tools are available to help children and families track and manage day-to-day symptoms, the decision of when and how to implement a longer-term step-up in care is less clear. Furthermore, treatment is challenged by the three age groups of childhood: adolescence (12–18 years old), school age (6–11 years old), and young children (≤ 5 years old). What works for one age group might not be the best approach for another. The Pediatric Asthma Yardstick provides an in-depth assessment of when and how to step up therapy for a child with not well or poorly controlled asthma.

Development of this tool follows others in the Yardstick series, presenting patient profiles and step-up strategies based on guidance documents but modified according to newer data and the authors' combined clinical experience. The objective is to provide clinicians who treat children with asthma practical and clinically relevant recommendations for each step-up and each intervention, with the intent of helping practitioners better treat their pediatric patients with asthma, particularly those who do not always respond to recommended therapies.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^114ZApJR]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

Clinician's Summary:

Most individuals aged 18 years and older with uncontrolled, moderate to severe, persistent asthma should not undergo bronchial thermoplasty (BT) to treat asthma because the benefits are small, the risks are moderate, and the long-term outcomes are uncertain. Some individuals with moderate to severe persistent asthma who have troublesome symptoms may be willing to accept the risks of BT and, therefore, might choose this intervention after shared decision-making with their healthcare provider. Clinicians should offer the procedure in the setting of a clinical trial or a registry study to enable the collection of long-term data on the use of BT for asthma.

The Expert Panel does not recommend BT for individuals aged 18 years and older as part of routine asthma care, even if these individuals have uncontrolled asthma despite using multicomponent medical therapy, because of the small benefit-to-risk ratio. The risks of BT include asthma exacerbations, hemoptysis, and atelectasis during the treatment period. Recognizing, however, that BT is currently being used, the Expert Panel offers the following suggestions for its safe use:

- **Recommendations for BT usage**:
	- BT should not be used in individuals with low lung function (FEV1 that is < 50% or 60% predicted) and life-threatening asthma.
	- BT has not been studied in individuals younger than age 18 years.
	- In the opinion of the Expert Panel, when BT is implemented, it should be used in settings that enroll participants in registries, ongoing clinical trials, or studies that track BT's long-term safety and effectiveness.

### Why and how to step down chronic asthma drugs [^11416gE4]. BMJ (2017). High credibility.

Asthma is a common chronic airway disease. The goal of asthma management is to control symptoms while minimizing the side effects of treatment. Following a period of stable asthma, clinicians should consider stepping down treatment. This approach is recommended by guidelines. Step-down has been studied for several types of asthma drug regimens, and certain approaches may have lower risk than others.

Systematic reviews of multiple trials support the following specific step-down approaches: optimizing inhaled corticosteroid dosing when stepping down oral corticosteroid, reducing inhaled corticosteroid from a higher dose, lowering inhaled corticosteroid-long acting bronchodilator (ICS-LABA) dose while adding ICS-LABA on-demand, adding leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) while lowering inhaled corticosteroid dose, and using allergen immunotherapy when reducing inhaled corticosteroid from a higher dose. Systematic reviews of multiple trials support an increased risk of asthma exacerbation for patients who completely stop taking inhaled corticosteroid or long acting bronchodilator.

Strategies to implement step-down in practice include the use of risk prediction as well as tools to support shared decision making and communication about risk between clinicians and patients.

### "As-needed" inhaled corticosteroids for patients with asthma [^1148QtHg]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). High credibility.

Prevention of severe asthma exacerbations is a primary management goal for asthma across the severity spectrum. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) decrease the risk of asthma exacerbations. However, patient adherence to ICS-containing medications as a daily maintenance therapy is poor, and many patients overuse short-acting beta-2 agonist relievers; both are associated with increased risk of severe exacerbations and death. Airway inflammation varies over time, influenced by exposures such as viral infections and allergens. As-needed ICS strategies, where patients receive ICSs (or additional ICSs if already taking controller therapy) whenever they use their reliever inhaler, empower patients to adjust their ICS intake in response to symptom fluctuation. These strategies can improve asthma morbidity outcomes, particularly by reducing severe exacerbations and the risk of adverse effects from oral corticosteroids.

In this review, the evidence for combination ICS-formoterol in a single inhaler, ICS and short-acting beta-2 agonists in separate inhalers, and combination ICS-albuterol in a single inhaler is presented, along with practical considerations, evidence gaps, and implications for clinical practice. These strategies are presented by level of asthma severity and age group. Improving access to such strategies on a global scale is imperative to improve asthma outcomes and achieve equity across populations.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113doBTf]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, specifically concerning the management of exacerbations and self-management, the GINA 2025 guidelines recommend including the following short-term self-management strategies for 1–4 weeks for worsening asthma as part of the written asthma action plans for patients on Track 2 with a combination of ICS and a short-acting β-blocker reliever:

- **Step 1, as-needed-only combination ICS-short-acting β-blocker as usual treatment**: Take 2 inhalations of ICS-short-acting β-blocker as needed for symptom relief, with a maximum of 12 inhalations in any 24-hour period.

- **Step 2, maintenance ICS as usual treatment**: Continue the usual maintenance ICS dose. Take 2 inhalations of ICS-short-acting β-blocker as needed for symptom relief, with a maximum of 12 inhalations of ICS-short-acting β-blocker in any 24-hour period.

- **Steps 3–4, maintenance ICS-long-acting β-blocker as usual treatment**: Continue the usual maintenance ICS-long-acting β-blocker dose. Take 2 inhalations of ICS-short-acting β-blocker as needed for symptom relief, with a maximum of 12 inhalations of ICS-short-acting β-blocker in any 24-hour period.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^112h6GxW]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

For individuals aged 12 years and older with mild persistent asthma, the Expert Panel recommends either of the following two treatments as part of Step 2 therapy: a daily low-dose ICS and as-needed SABA for quick-relief therapy or intermittent as-needed SABA and an ICS used concomitantly (i.e. one after the other) for worsening asthma. In this recommendation, "intermittent" ICS dosing is defined as the temporary use of an ICS in response to worsening asthma in an individual who is not taking ICS controller therapy regularly. This recommendation does not apply to ages 5 to 11 years because this therapy has not been adequately studied in this age group.

- **Implementation guidance**: Individuals aged 12 years and older with mild persistent asthma who are not taking asthma treatment may benefit from this therapy. The Expert Panel has made no recommendation for children aged 0 to 4 years or 5 to 11 years with mild persistent asthma due to insufficient evidence.

- **Candidate suitability**: Individuals aged 12 years and older with asthma and a low or high perception of symptoms may not be good candidates for as-needed ICS therapy. Regular low-dose ICS with SABA for quick-relief therapy may be preferred for such patients to avoid ICS undertreatment (low symptom perception) or overtreatment (high symptom perception).

Based on the regimen assessed in three of the four studies on intermittent ICS dosing, one approach to intermittent therapy is…

### Optimal asthma control: Time for a new target [^113Xumkj]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The stepwise approach to pharmacological treatment in adult asthma mandates that asthma treatment is progressively stepped up to achieve symptom control and reduce the risk of exacerbations, and stepped down following a period of prolonged control. This review proposes that in adults without good asthma control, well-controlled asthma can only be achieved in approximately 70% of patients across the strata of severity and only if there is a progressive increase in inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting β2 agonist therapy to a maintenance inhaled corticosteroid dose that causes the same magnitude of systemic side effects as oral prednisone at a 5-mg daily dose.

Another consideration is that in a person with asthma, there are numerous overlapping disorders that can present with symptoms indistinguishable from asthma, comorbidities that contribute to poor control, and lifestyle/environmental factors that require treatment in their own right and that, if specifically managed, might lead to better outcomes. The disparity between patients' perceptions and guideline assessment of control may be due to partially controlled asthma being associated with near-maximal levels of quality of life, with minimal impairment.

Finally, it is widely assumed that asthma symptom control equates to elimination of risk of asthma attacks, an assumption that may not apply to many patients, particularly those with more severe asthma. We propose that further research be undertaken to determine the optimal levels of asthma control and the potential value of different treatment targets, such as control of type-2 ai.

### GINA guidelines on asthma and beyond [^117Kb3cg]. Allergy (2007). Low credibility.

Clinical guidelines are systematically developed statements designed to help practitioners and patients make decisions regarding appropriate health care for specific circumstances. These guidelines are grounded in the scientific evidence on therapeutic interventions. The first asthma guidelines were published in the mid-1980s when asthma emerged as a recognized public health problem in many countries. The Global Initiative on Asthma (GINA) was launched in 1995 as a collaborative effort between the NHLBI and the World Health Organization (WHO). While the first edition was opinion-based, subsequent updates have been evidence-based. A new update of the GINA guidelines is now available, focusing on disease control. Asthma guidelines are crafted to stimulate the implementation of practical measures aimed at reducing the global burden of asthma. Although not perfect, these guidelines seem to be the best resource available to assist primary care physicians and patients in attaining optimal asthma care.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^1167KLGk]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

In GRADE, each recommendation has a direction, meaning that the recommendation is either for, or against the use of an intervention. Each recommendation is also either strong or conditional, as explained in Table IE. Strong recommendations are those for which, in the judgment of the Expert Panel after it has reviewed all of the evidence and individual judgments, all or almost all people would choose the recommended course of action. Conditional recommendations are those for which, after reviewing all of the evidence and individual judgments, the Expert Panel believes that many informed people are likely to make different decisions about whether to take the recommended course of action. A conditional recommendation implies that engaging in a shared decision-making process is essential for individuals with asthma and their health care providers.

The Expert Panel drafted, discussed, and revised the recommendations multiple times before all eligible members (those who did not have a conflict of interest for the topic) voted on each recommendation. The Expert Panel achieved consensus when more than 90% of the Expert Panel members voted in favor of a recommendation. If less than 90% of members voted in favor of a recommendation, the relevant topic team continued to revise the recommendation until it achieved consensus approval according to these criteria.

### Evidence-based asthma management [^116UfNTS]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

In 2002, the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program published evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma. However, some unresolved asthma-management issues need further research. For asthmatic children, inhaled corticosteroids are more beneficial than as-needed use of beta(2) agonists, long-acting beta(2) agonists, theophylline, cromolyn sodium, nedocromil, or any combination of those. Leukotriene modifiers are an alternative but not a preferred treatment; they should be considered if the medication needs to be administered orally rather than via inhalation. Cromolyn sodium and nedocromil are effective long-term asthma-control medications, but they are not as effective as inhaled corticosteroids. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether cromolyn benefits the maintenance of childhood asthma.

Cromolyn sodium and nedocromil are alternatives, but not preferred treatments for mild persistent asthma. Cromolyn may be useful as preventive therapy prior to exertion or unavoidable exposure to allergens. Regular inhalation of corticosteroids controls asthma significantly better than as-needed beta(2) agonists. No studies have examined the long-term impact of regular inhaled corticosteroids on lung function in children ≤ 5 years old. As monotherapy, inhaled corticosteroids are more effective than long-acting beta(2) agonists. The asthma-control benefit of inhaled corticosteroids decidedly outweighs the risks from inhaled corticosteroids. There is no high-level evidence that low-to-medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids have ocular to…

### Assessing health outcomes, quality of life, and healthcare use among school-age children with asthma [^116nSBhh]. The Journal of Asthma (2019). High credibility.

Asthma affects six million children in the United States. Most people can control their asthma symptoms with effective care, management, and appropriate medical treatment. Information on the relationship between asthma control and quality of life indicators and healthcare use among school-age children is limited.

- **Methods**: Using the 2006–2010 combined Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System Asthma Call-back Survey child data, we examined asthma control and asthma attack status among school-age (aged 5–17 years) children with asthma from 35 states and the District of Columbia. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess if having uncontrolled asthma and having ≥ 1 asthma attacks affect quality of life (activity limitation and missed school days) and healthcare use (emergency department [ED] visits and hospitalizations).

- **Results**: About one-third (36.5%) of the 8,484 respondents with asthma had uncontrolled asthma, and 56.8% reported ≥ 1 asthma attack in the past year. Having uncontrolled asthma and having ≥ 1 asthma attack were significantly associated with activity limitation (aPR = 1.43 and 1.74, respectively), missed school (1.45 and 1.68), ED visits (2.05 and 4.78), and hospitalizations (2.38 and 3.64). Long-term control (LTC) medication use was higher among respondents with uncontrolled asthma (61.3%) than respondents with well-controlled asthma (33.5%).

- **Conclusions**: Having uncontrolled asthma is associated with reduced quality of life and increased healthcare use. However, only 61.3% of respondents with uncontrolled asthma use LTC medication.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111vyWEz]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of asthma, particularly in the context of managing exacerbations and self-management, the GINA 2025 guidelines recommend considering a short course of oral corticosteroids for severe exacerbations. This includes doses of 40–50 mg/day for 5–7 days for adults and adolescents, and 0.5 mg/kg/day, with a maximum of 40 mg/day, for 3–5 days for children. Severe exacerbations may be indicated by a peak expiratory flow or FEV1 less than 60% of the individual's personal best or predicted value, or if there is no response to prior treatment over 2–3 days. It is preferable to administer doses in the morning after the initial dose to minimize insomnia. Patients should be advised about potential adverse effects. Tapering is not necessary if oral corticosteroids are taken for less than 2 weeks.

### Asthma maintenance and reliever therapy: Should this be the standard of care [^111a3w1W]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2020). High credibility.

The goal of asthma management is to achieve optimal asthma control, defined by the absence of daytime symptoms, nighttime waking, reliever use, functional limitation, lung function stability, and also to reduce the future risks of asthma exacerbations, deterioration in lung function, and the medication's adverse effects. The most widely used maintenance therapy is inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs). This review considered the evidence in which the combination of the ICS budesonide and the rapid-onset long-acting β-agonist (LABA) formoterol can be used as a standard of care for maintenance and reliever therapy in moderate to severe asthma.

- **Data sources**: The archival literature of peer-reviewed studies on the efficacy and safety of budesonide-formoterol as maintenance and reliever therapy in moderate to severe asthma.

- **Results**: The ICS-LABA combination containing budesonide-formoterol reduces the future risk of severe asthma exacerbations and provides similar levels of day-to-day asthma control compared with using high-dose ICS alone, or combination ICS-LABA therapy and short-acting β₂-agonist as a reliever.

- **Conclusion**: Budesonide-formoterol as a single combination maintenance and reliever inhaler is effective in reducing asthma exacerbation risk, requires a lower maintenance dose of ICS, and results in a simplified approach to asthma management.

### Improving asthma management: The case for mandatory inclusion of dose counters on all rescue bronchodilators [^1156rZAa]. The Journal of Asthma (2013). Low credibility.

Asthma remains a serious global health challenge. Poor control of asthma symptoms is due in part to the incorrect use of oral inhaler devices that deliver asthma medications, such as poor inhalation technique or use of a metered dose inhaler (MDI) after the recommended number of doses is expelled.

- **Objective**: To review published research on the potential for patients to overestimate or underestimate the amount of asthma rescue medication in MDIs without integrated dose-counting mechanisms.

- **Methods**: We searched PubMed and EMBASE using search terms "dose counter and asthma" and "dose counter and metered dose inhaler" for English language publications up to July 2012, with a manual search of references from relevant articles.

- **Results**: Up to 40% of patients believe they are taking their asthma medication when they actually are activating an empty or nearly empty MDI. Device design makes it impossible for an MDI to cease delivering drug doses at an exact point, and the number of actuations in an MDI may be twice the nominal number of recommended medication doses. Once the recommended number of medication doses is expelled, remaining actuations deliver decreasing concentrations of active medication and increasing concentrations of propellants and excipients. This phenomenon, called "tail-off", is particularly problematic when medications are formulated as suspensions, as are rescue medications to control acute bronchospasm. Reliable inhalation of rescue medication could reduce asthma-related morbidity.

- **Conclusion**: By helping to ensure that patients receive accurate medication doses, reliable dosing counters can play a critical role in reducing asthma-related morbidity.

### The effects of different follow-up management on asthma control: a prospective cohort study [^112ZkXGP]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disorder characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms, impaired pulmonary function, and acute exacerbations requiring emergency medical intervention. Epidemiological data indicate approximately 358 million asthma cases worldwide, of which only 28.5% have achieved optimal disease control. Substantial evidence demonstrates that uncontrolled asthma correlates significantly with inadequate patient education, deficient self-management competencies, and improper inhalation techniques, underscoring the critical need for enhanced long-term follow-up strategies.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) emphasizes the pivotal role of regular follow-ups in disease management. While conventional clinic-based follow-ups provide comprehensive clinical evaluations, they are hampered by a 35% attrition rate. Telephone follow-ups, despite improving accessibility, yield only 62.3% patient satisfaction rates. Emerging mobile health technologies present novel solutions, with clinical trials demonstrating that app-based interventions can enhance asthma control rates by 40%. WeChat, the main social media platform for Chinese people, accounting for 86% of the users, shows special prospects in chronic disease management and has improved the drug compliance of chronic disease patients by 2.1 times. Nevertheless, robust comparative evidence evaluating different asthma follow-up modalities remains scarce.

This 12-month prospective cohort study systematically compared three follow-up methods (telephone, WeChat, and respiratory outpatient clinic).

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^1176KhHc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

The outcomes did not differ in the groups treated with the two alternate regimens in the three studies, focusing on individuals aged 12 years and older. However, because none of these studies was powered as an equivalence study, the Expert Panel made a conditional recommendation. Although the studies had high certainty of evidence for asthma control and quality of life, they had low certainty of evidence for exacerbations. Taken together, this resulted in an overall low certainty for the recommendation statement. The Expert Panel made no recommendation based on this comparison for children aged 4 to 11 years because the only small included study in this population had low certainty of evidence, and one additional study had a study design that precluded evaluation for this key question.

- **Recommendation 11**: In individuals aged 4 years and older with mild to moderate persistent asthma who are likely to be adherent to daily ICS treatment, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends against a short-term increase in the ICS dose for increased symptoms or decreased peak flow.

- **Conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence**.

- **Implementation guidance**: This recommendation addresses temporary increases in the dose of an ICS that is otherwise taken as controller therapy in response to worsening asthma. For this recommendation, a short-term increase in ICS dose refers to a doubling, quadrupling, or quintupling of the regular daily dose for individuals aged 4 years and older with mild to moderate persistent asthma who are likely to adhere to their daily regimen.

### Stability of asthma symptom control in a longitudinal study of mild-moderate asthmatics [^111Reaqi]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Achieving and maintaining symptom control is a primary goal of asthma management. Although factors associated with the likelihood of achieving symptom control have been studied, there are unanswered questions on the stability of symptom control, that is, the tendency of individuals to remain at a given symptom control level over time.

- **Objective**: The objective of this study was to evaluate the stability of symptom control using a longitudinal cohort of mild-moderate asthmatics.

- **Methods**: Participants reported symptom control using the Global Initiative for Asthma criteria at five assessments during the 1-year follow-up period. We described variability in the stability of symptom control between individuals and used a random-effects logistic regression model to evaluate the impact of a suite of factors on the stability of symptom control.

- **Results**: A total of 429 individuals (67% female, mean age 51.6) contributed 2141 study visits. Individuals varied from completely stable in symptom control (18% remained at the same control level in all five visits) to completely unstable (12% changed the control level between all subsequent visits). Only 4% of between-individual variation in the stability of symptom control was explained by the included exposures, and a secondary analysis indicated that the history of symptom control stability was the best predictor of stability.

- **Conclusions**: The tendency to remain at a given control level varies significantly among patients with asthma. Only a small fraction of this variability is explained by observable characteristics.

### Global initiative for asthma strategy 2021: Executive summary and rationale for key changes [^111XN5KB]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Asthma severity is assessed retrospectively, after at least 2–3 months of treatment, from the level of treatment required to control symptoms and exacerbations. By consensus, GINA does not distinguish between so-called "intermittent" and "mild persistent" asthma because this historical distinction was arbitrary, with no evidence of a difference in the treatment response. Severe asthma remains uncontrolled despite optimized treatment with high-dose ICS–LABA or requires such treatment to prevent it from becoming uncontrolled. It is important to distinguish between severe asthma and difficult-to-treat asthma, which may be uncontrolled due to factors like incorrect inhaler technique, poor adherence, and comorbidities such as obesity and environmental exposures.

This definition of asthma severity is effective at the severe end of the spectrum but is less useful for describing mild asthma. For example, patients with infrequent or no interval symptoms can still have severe exacerbations. This risk is reduced to a similar extent by either daily ICS treatment or by ICS–formoterol taken only for symptom relief, and the baseline symptom frequency does not predict the need for daily ICS.

### Considering therapeutic options in the real world [^116FVHes]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

When choosing a drug regimen, physicians can rely on two models: their own clinical experience and results from clinical trials. Both options have problems. Overall, patients with persistent asthma symptoms often experience improved outcomes with the use of long-term controller medications on a daily basis to prevent exacerbations of symptoms. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are generally recognized as the most effective treatment for the underlying inflammatory characteristics of asthma. However, despite adequate dosing, some patients with persistent asthma remain symptomatic while taking an ICS. Therefore, it may be beneficial to administer combination therapy with an ICS and a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) in this subset of asthma patients. Another anti-inflammatory choice for persistent asthma is the leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA), either as monotherapy or in combination with an ICS. Regardless of the treatment regimen a physician chooses to prescribe, the choice of medication depends on many factors, including patient preference, physician comfort with the regimen, and cost.

### Should we apply a treatable traits approach to asthma care [^113U3MXE]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

To explore the evidence for adopting a "treatable traits" approach to asthma management, the study utilized data sources such as PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar. The databases were searched for randomized, controlled phase III or IV trials of adults containing the word "asthma" in the title published in the previous 10 years. Additionally, articles containing the title words "treatable AND trait(s)", "asthma AND biomarker(s) OR smoking OR obesity OR laryngeal OR management" were considered if published within the previous 5 years. Only English-language articles were included. The search identified 257 articles suitable for consideration. Additionally, reference lists of identified studies were manually searched, and websites of the British Thoracic Society, European Respiratory Society, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, and the Global Initiative for Asthma were reviewed for specific guidance related to asthma management.

The results highlight that the "treatable traits" are categorized into three domains: pulmonary, extrapulmonary, and behavioral and lifestyle traits. The study evaluates whether treatment should target these traits in asthma patients based on current evidence, rather than merely increasing treatment in response to symptoms as outlined in Step-up, step-down asthma management guidelines.

In conclusion, the study advocates for a broader application of the treatable traits approach in the assessment and management of inadequately controlled asthma, as opposed to relying on a step-up, step-down method based purely on patient symptoms.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114nrzF9]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to the adjustment of treatment and stepping up, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend stepping up treatment with the following adjustment options when asthma remains uncontrolled despite good adherence and inhaler technique:

- **Day-to-day adjustment using an anti-inflammatory reliever**: Adjust the number of as-needed doses of ICS-formoterol from day to day according to symptoms (by the patient), if the reliever inhaler is budesonide-formoterol or beclometasone-formoterol (with or without maintenance ICS-formoterol).

- **Short-term step up (for 1–2 weeks)**: Increase the dose of maintenance ICS for 1–2 weeks (by the patient according to the written asthma action plan or by the healthcare provider), for example, during viral infections or seasonal allergen exposure.

- **Sustained step up (for at least 2–3 months)**: Increase the low dose of maintenance ICS to medium when the symptoms are confirmed to be due to asthma, inhaler technique and adherence are satisfactory, and modifiable risk factors such as smoking have been addressed. Reduce the dose to the previous level if there is no response after 2–3 months, and consider offering alternative treatments or referring to a specialist center.

### BTS/NICE/SIGN joint guideline on asthma: Diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (November 2024) - Summary of recommendations [^113Waoay]. Thorax (2025). High credibility.

Initial management of newly diagnosed asthma in people aged 12 and over:

- **Offer a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/formoterol combination inhaler**: This should be taken as needed for symptom relief in individuals aged 12 and over with newly diagnosed asthma.

- **Specific inhalers**:
	- In November 2024, only certain budesonide/formoterol inhalers were licensed for as-needed Airway Inflammation Reduction (AIR) therapy in mild asthma. Usage of any other ICS/formoterol inhalers would thus be off-label. The evidence supporting the use of budesonide/formoterol is based on the use of a dry powder inhaler.

- **Highly symptomatic presentation or severe exacerbation**:
	- If the person presents with high symptom burden (such as regular nocturnal waking) or severe exacerbation, initiate treatment with low-dose Maintenance and Reliever Therapy (MART) alongside managing acute symptoms as indicated (which may include a course of oral corticosteroids). Consider stepping down to as-needed AIR therapy using a low-dose ICS/formoterol inhaler at a later date, contingent upon achieving asthma control.

For a brief explanation of the rationale behind these recommendations and their potential impact on practice, please refer to the committee's full discussion and evidence review.

### Long-term corticosteroid use, adrenal insufficiency and the need for steroid-sparing treatment in adult severe asthma [^111Vkt1Y]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Unfortunately, there is no established dosage or duration of OCS determined to control asthma symptoms without causing adverse effects (AEs). Experts are calling for 'OCS stewardship' to reduce risks, including adrenal insufficiency (AI), related to OCS use. To mitigate the potential for AEs, OCS use should be minimized by optimizing inhaled and biologic therapies for asthma. The availability of newer biologics has led to the advent of OCS-sparing therapies in asthma, although the process by which long-term corticosteroids should be tapered or discontinued has not been established. Consideration should be given to the risk of symptom recurrence and withdrawal-induced AI.

In 2020, a consensus statement on OCS use was issued by 131 practitioners from specialties that frequently use OCS, mostly pulmonologists, respiratory disease specialists, and allergists. More than 95% of participating experts concurred that the ultimate goal in asthma should be to avoid OCS use. When OCS are required, the dosage and duration should be minimized as much as possible. Experts also agreed that individualized tapering to a minimally effective dosage, or complete discontinuation, should be attempted for all patients receiving OCS for maintenance therapy, regardless of comorbid conditions. Regarding AI risk, the experts agreed that AI is insufficiently assessed, and patients on long-term OCS therapy should be evaluated for the risk and presence of AI. This includes patients receiving OCS dosages exceeding 2.0 g per year or more than four repeat courses of short-term OCS in one year.
