## Question

Do airway narrowing and the use of a bronchodilator reduce inflammation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether airway narrowing reduces inflammation and whether bronchodilators reduce inflammation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology linking inflammation, airway narrowing, and airflow limitation. Then, I should examine whether the mechanical act of airway narrowing could, in itself, feed back to suppress inflammation. Next, I will review the evidence for anti-inflammatory effects of bronchodilators by class (SABA, LABA, SAMA/LAMA) and contrast this with established anti-inflammatory therapies such as inhaled corticosteroids. Finally, I should confirm what guidelines and higher-quality syntheses say about clinical relevance and treatment implications in asthma and COPD, and reconcile any apparent contradictions in the literature.

> Let me first confirm definitions so I don't misinterpret the question. Airway narrowing refers to reduced airway caliber from smooth-muscle contraction, mucous plugging, and inflammatory edema, which produces airflow limitation in asthma and COPD and drives dyspnea and wheeze, while bronchodilators (β2-agonists and muscarinic antagonists) primarily relax airway smooth muscle to improve airflow, and airway inflammation is the chronic immune-mediated process with eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, cytokines, and remodeling that underlies obstructive airway disease pathobiology [^112dW3Vx] [^115ptUqt] [^114dCynX] [^1134v7VS] [^114pHVQC].

> Now, does airway narrowing itself reduce inflammation? Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — narrowing is consistently described as a downstream consequence of inflammatory mediators and autonomic tone, not a mechanism that dampens inflammatory cell recruitment or mediator release; if anything, it worsens ventilation–perfusion mismatch and mucus stasis, which can propagate local inflammatory activity rather than suppress it [^1126RZe4] [^1134v7VS] [^112dW3Vx] [^114pHVQC]. I should double-check for any reported negative feedback loops via mechanical stress, but standard sources do not describe narrowing as anti-inflammatory in clinical contexts [^1126RZe4] [^1134v7VS].

> Next, do bronchodilators reduce inflammation? Let me think this through mechanistically first: their primary action is smooth-muscle relaxation and reduced cholinergic tone, improving lung mechanics and symptoms; guidelines frame bronchodilators as the mainstay for symptom control in COPD, whereas anti-inflammatory control in asthma relies on corticosteroids, implying any anti-inflammatory signal from bronchodilators is minor or not clinically decisive [^112H6XtA] [^115ptUqt] [^112dW3Vx]. I need to check each class for evidence of independent anti-inflammatory effects and whether these translate into clinically meaningful outcomes [^112H6XtA] [^115ptUqt].

> Starting with short-acting β2-agonists (SABA), wait, let me verify that any purported anti-inflammatory effect isn't just improved airflow masquerading as reduced inflammation. The literature and contemporary practice guidance emphasize that SABAs are relievers without anti-inflammatory control, SABA-only strategies perform poorly, and overuse correlates with worse outcomes, which is consistent with absence of meaningful anti-inflammatory action in routine care [^1148QtHg] [^111iH88S] [^1147aU9S]. This is why as-needed regimens now pair reliever therapy with corticosteroid exposure to actually suppress inflammation while relieving symptoms [^1148QtHg].

> For long-acting β2-agonists (LABA), I should confirm reports of anti-inflammatory signals from allergen-challenge paradigms. Indeed, LABAs may inhibit eosinophil recruitment and stabilize mast cells acutely, but chronic airway inflammation appears largely unaffected, and LABAs are not considered anti-inflammatory monotherapy; in asthma, they must be combined with ICS to address inflammation safely and effectively [^113WDL37] [^114VKufj] [^115ptUqt]. But wait, what if synergy with ICS confounds interpretation? That synergy is real and therapeutically important, yet it does not convert LABA into an anti-inflammatory controller by itself [^112MzEcR].

> Turning to muscarinic antagonists (SAMA/LAMA), let me check for class-specific anti-inflammatory effects. In COPD, reductions in exacerbations with LABA/LAMA combinations are plausibly mediated by improvements in hyperinflation, mucus clearance, and symptoms; preclinical anti-inflammatory effects have not been convincingly demonstrated in patients, so their anti-inflammatory role remains unproven clinically in COPD [^112v7dHk]. However, in asthma, emerging evidence and expert consensus suggest LAMAs may exert additional anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects via muscarinic receptors on immune and structural cells, though they are still positioned as add-on bronchodilators, not primary anti-inflammatory controllers, which tempers the clinical weight of these mechanistic findings [^114HRXPo] [^115ptUqt].

> I should also anchor the answer with what definitively reduces airway inflammation in clinical practice. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the established anti-inflammatory therapy in asthma, lowering biomarkers such as FeNO and eosinophils, improving hyperresponsiveness and outcomes, and working synergistically with LABAs; a fixed extrafine BDP/formoterol combination shows rapid effects on both bronchoconstriction and inflammatory indices, illustrating that the anti-inflammatory component is the steroid, potentiated by LABA synergy, not bronchodilation alone [^112RvAcG] [^114dCynX] [^113MHJZx] [^112MzEcR]. In COPD, ICS have modest anti-inflammatory and exacerbation-reduction benefits in selected phenotypes, but long-acting bronchodilators remain first-line for symptom control, underscoring the distinction between bronchodilation and inflammation control [^112H6XtA] [^1134v7VS] [^112MzEcR].

> Let me now reconcile the guideline perspective so I don't overstate class effects. GOLD endorses LABA and LAMA as foundational maintenance therapy in COPD for symptom relief and exacerbation reduction, while reserving ICS for appropriate phenotypes and combinations; this supports the view that bronchodilators primarily address mechanics, with any anti-inflammatory effect not being the main therapeutic rationale in COPD [^112H6XtA] [^115JYdST]. In asthma, contemporary strategies discourage SABA-only regimens and favor ICS-containing approaches, including as-needed ICS-formoterol, precisely to ensure anti-inflammatory treatment accompanies symptom relief, again signaling that bronchodilation alone does not control inflammation [^1148QtHg].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the direct answers. Airway narrowing does not reduce inflammation; it is a pathophysiologic consequence of inflammation and autonomic tone without evidence of anti-inflammatory feedback benefit in clinical disease states [^1126RZe4] [^1134v7VS] [^112dW3Vx]. Bronchodilators, across SABA, LABA, and SAMA/LAMA classes, primarily improve airway mechanics; while there are intriguing mechanistic or challenge-model signals, clinically meaningful anti-inflammatory effects are not established for SABAs or LABAs as monotherapy, are not the main rationale for LAMAs in COPD, and should not be relied upon for inflammation control in asthma, where ICS-based therapy is required and synergizes with LABAs to improve outcomes [^1148QtHg] [^115ptUqt] [^113WDL37] [^112v7dHk] [^114HRXPo] [^112MzEcR].

Bronchodilators **do not directly reduce airway inflammation** [^1112gXm3]; they relieve bronchoconstriction and improve airflow [^115ptUqt], but inflammation persists unless treated with anti-inflammatory agents such as inhaled corticosteroids [^114dCynX]. In asthma, bronchodilators provide rapid symptom relief but do not address the underlying inflammatory process, so anti-inflammatory therapy is essential for long-term control [^1148QtHg]. In COPD, bronchodilators improve symptoms and reduce exacerbations, but their anti-inflammatory effects are limited and inconsistent; inflammation persists without targeted anti-inflammatory treatment [^112v7dHk] [^1134v7VS]. Therefore, clinicians should **combine bronchodilators with anti-inflammatory medications** to effectively manage airway inflammation [^112H6XtA] [^1148QtHg].

## Mechanisms of airway narrowing and inflammation

Airway narrowing in asthma and COPD results from bronchoconstriction, mucus hypersecretion [^1126RZe4], and airway wall thickening caused by inflammation and remodeling [^114Zno5J]. Inflammation involves multiple inflammatory cells and mediators — including eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, cytokines, and chemokines — leading to **chronic airway inflammation and structural changes** [^1119Ha8n] [^114dCynX].

---

## Bronchodilators: mechanisms of action

Bronchodilators, including beta-agonists and anticholinergics, primarily **relax airway smooth muscle** [^112dW3Vx], thereby improving airflow and reducing symptoms such as dyspnea and wheezing. Beta-agonists stimulate beta-adrenergic receptors to relax smooth muscle, while anticholinergics block muscarinic receptors, reducing bronchoconstriction and mucus secretion [^115ptUqt].

---

## Bronchodilators and inflammation: clinical evidence

### Asthma

In asthma, bronchodilators provide **rapid symptom relief** but do not address the underlying inflammatory process [^114VKufj]. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) **are the cornerstone of asthma management**, effectively reducing airway inflammation, improving lung function, and preventing exacerbations [^114dCynX]. Long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs), when combined with ICS, improve symptom control and reduce exacerbations [^113MHJZx], but their anti-inflammatory effects remain **limited and inconsistent** [^113WDL37].

---

### COPD

In COPD, bronchodilators improve symptoms, reduce exacerbations, and enhance quality of life [^112dW3Vx]; however, their anti-inflammatory effects are **limited and inconsistent**, and inflammation persists despite bronchodilator therapy [^112v7dHk]. When combined with bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) reduce exacerbations and improve symptoms [^112MzEcR], but their anti-inflammatory effects in COPD are **modest compared with asthma** [^1134v7VS] [^114DMf6e].

---

## Limitations of bronchodilators in reducing inflammation

Bronchodilators primarily target airway smooth muscle tone and **do not directly modulate inflammatory pathways** [^1112gXm3]. Therefore, inflammation persists unless specifically targeted by anti-inflammatory medications, such as corticosteroids or other agents [^1134v7VS].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of **combining bronchodilators with anti-inflammatory medications** to effectively manage airway inflammation in asthma and COPD [^112H6XtA]. Bronchodilators alone are **insufficient to control inflammation** and prevent disease progression [^1148QtHg].

---

## Conclusion

Bronchodilators primarily relieve bronchoconstriction and improve airflow but **do not significantly reduce airway inflammation** [^112v7dHk]. Effective management of airway inflammation requires anti-inflammatory medications, such as inhaled corticosteroids, used in combination with bronchodilators [^114dCynX] [^112MzEcR].

### Clinical pharmacology of bronchodilator medications [^112dW3Vx]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

Obstructive lung diseases, including asthma and COPD, are characterized by airflow limitation. Bronchodilator therapy can often decrease symptoms of airflow obstruction by relaxing airway smooth muscle (bronchodilation), decreasing dyspnea, and improving quality of life. In this review, we discuss the pharmacology of the β agonist and anticholinergic bronchodilators and their use, particularly in asthma and COPD. Expanding knowledge of receptor subtypes and G-protein signaling, agonist and antagonist specificity, and drug delivery has led to the introduction of safer medications with fewer off-target effects, medications with longer duration of action that may improve adherence, and more effective and efficient aerosol delivery devices.

### Review of drug development guidance to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: US and EU perspectives [^115ptUqt]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Low credibility.

The majority of approved COPD medications are either bronchodilators or anti-inflammatory therapies; the following briefly outlines the treatment options for COPD. There are a number of excellent reviews that summarize the safety and efficacy of these marketed COPD medications.

- **Bronchodilators**: Bronchodilators are the mainstay of pharmacological treatment of COPD. Two classes of bronchodilators can be distinguished: β2-adrenoreceptor agonists and muscarinic antagonists. The β2-adrenoreceptor agonists stimulate airway smooth muscles to induce bronchodilation. Although their anti-inflammatory properties have been postulated to contribute to their efficacy in COPD treatment, this has not been proven to be relevant for the clinical setting. Muscarinic receptors affect bronchial motor tone and mucus secretion through the cholinergic system by coupling to G-proteins Gα q/11 (M1, M3, and M5 receptor subtypes) or Gα i/o (M2 and M4 receptor subtypes). Although M2 receptors indirectly affect airway smooth muscle contraction, M3 receptors dominantly contribute to relaxation and dilation of airway smooth muscles. M3 receptors also mediate cholinergic effects on mucus secretion. Selective M3-muscarinic receptor inhibition improves bronchodilation as well as mucus production.

As summarized in Table 1, GOLD class A patients are typically well-managed on either a short-acting or long-acting bronchodilator, depending upon their symptoms. GOLD class B patients may start on a single long-acting β2-adrenoreceptor (LABA) or lon…

### Inhaled corticosteroids in asthma management [^114dCynX]. Respiratory Care (2008). Low credibility.

Asthma is a disorder of the lower airways, characterized by bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airflow limitation, the pathogenesis of which is yet to be fully understood. Regardless of its triggers, the hallmark of asthma is a state of inflammation that, when uncontrolled, results in the persistence of symptoms. Inhaled corticosteroids are established as the mainstay of asthma therapy. This paper examines what is currently available among this class of drugs including features of the ideal inhaled corticosteroid, delivery systems, dose-response relationships, adverse effects, and combination with long-acting beta agonists.

- **Equipotent doses**: Among the different types will be discussed along with several special scenarios.

Special scenarios involve the apparent incomplete or lack of response to treatment with inhaled corticosteroids among certain subgroups of patients, such as smokers and obese individuals. We will discuss the scientific basis of such resistance and suggest alternative approaches to therapy.

### Inflammation in COPD: Implications for management [^1134v7VS]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is recognized by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines as an inflammatory disease state, and treatment rationales are provided accordingly. However, not all physicians follow or are even aware of these guidelines. Research has shown that COPD inflammation involves multiple inflammatory cells and mediators, and the underlying pathology differs from asthma inflammation. For these reasons, therapeutic agents that are effective in asthma patients may not be optimal in COPD patients. COPD exacerbations are intensified inflammatory events compared with stable COPD.

The clinical and systemic consequences believed to result from the chronic inflammation observed in COPD suggest that inflammation intensity is a key factor in COPD and exacerbation severity and frequency. Although inhaled corticosteroids are commonly used and are essential in asthma management, their efficacy in COPD is limited, with only a modest effect at reducing exacerbations. The importance of inflammation in COPD needs to be better understood by clinicians, and the differences in inflammation in COPD versus asthma should be considered carefully to optimize the use of anti-inflammatory agents.

### Use of fractional exhaled nitric oxide to guide the treatment of asthma: An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^112RvAcG]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Nitric oxide (NO) is a gas that can be measured in the exhaled breath. Measuring the fraction of this gas during a steady-state exhalation, called the fractional exhaled NO (F NO), is a standardized and quantitative method for assessing the levels of this gas in exhaled breath. The source of F NO comes from the action of several different NO synthase (NOS) enzymes, but the principal source of the increased levels of NO identified in asthma comes from the inducible NOS 2 (iNOS2) enzyme that is induced in the airway epithelium from inflammation.

Functions attributed to NO include actions as a vasodilator, bronchodilator, neurotransmitter, and mediator of inflammation. A number of these roles may be protective in nature, leading to trials to augment the levels of NO in the airways through the administration of arginine and citrulline in selected individuals with asthma. There are also several homeostatic functions attributed to NO, including bactericidal and cytotoxic effects that play a role in host defense. F NO correlates well with airway eosinophilic inflammation measured in induced sputum, providing a noninvasive way to assess T2 airway inflammation in asthma.

Treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) results in a marked decrease in F NO levels in a subset of patients with ongoing inflammation. There is strong evidence that F NO levels correlate with features of T2 inflammation, particularly the levels of eosinophilia in the peripheral blood and induced sputum. In individuals with atopic asthma, F NO levels tend to correlate with elevated total serum IgE levels.

### Corticosteroid therapy and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114Ri8jT]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized in part by a chronic inflammatory state in the airways (largely from chronic noxious stimuli such as tobacco smoke), punctuated with acute inflammatory exacerbations, which are often infectious. Although pathologically and biochemically different from the inflammation of asthma, the chronic inflammation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, especially in subgroups with asthma-like features and particularly during exacerbations, might be expected to respond to corticosteroid therapy, as does asthma. Complications from long-term corticosteroid use are important, but they appear less when the corticosteroid is given via the inhaled route. Clinical evidence is particularly strong supporting the use of inhaled corticosteroids to prevent exacerbations and oral corticosteroids to reduce the duration and impact of exacerbations.

### Dual combination therapy versus long-acting bronchodilators alone for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112MzEcR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

There are various inhaler classes and delivery devices available to manage COPD. The mainstay of inhaler therapy is to effectively target the autonomic nervous system, including the beta‐adrenergic receptors (i.e. short‐acting beta agonist (SABA) and LABA) and muscarinic receptors (i.e. LAMA) in the airways. The physiological goal of inhaler therapy is to reduce inflammation and dilate the airways by affecting the inflammatory cascade and autonomic tone, respectively. This is done to favor improved lung mechanics.

Dual therapy with LABA in combination with LAMA or ICS is available for maintenance inhaler therapy, and the addition of a LAMA to ICS/LABA is available in inhalers for triple therapy. When combined with LABAs, ICSs have a synergistic effect. ICSs upregulate beta2‐adrenergic receptors, and beta2‐adrenergic agonists facilitate the translocation of steroid receptors from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Drug synergy between the beta2‐adrenergic receptor agonist and muscarinic antagonist may be due to targeting both autonomic pathways, leading to bronchial smooth muscle relaxation. Clinical studies have suggested that an ICS/LABA combination significantly improves lung function, health status, and the rate of exacerbation when compared to placebo, LABA alone, or ICS alone. However, due to the adverse effect profile, including an increased risk for pneumonia with the use of ICS, ICS/LABA combinations are not considered first‐line therapy in GOLD groups A or B.

### The bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory effect of long-acting muscarinic antagonists in asthma: An EAACI position paper [^114HRXPo]. Allergy (2025). High credibility.

As cholinergic innervation is a major contributor to increased vagal tone and mucus secretion, inhaled long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) are a pillar for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. By blocking the muscarinic receptors expressed in the lung, LAMA improve lung function and reduce exacerbations in asthma patients who remain poorly controlled despite treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β2 agonists. Asthma guidelines recommend LAMA as a third controller to be added on before the initiation of biologicals.

In addition to bronchodilation, LAMA also exert anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects by inhibiting muscarinic receptors present in neutrophils, macrophages, fibroblasts, and airway smooth muscle cells. Thus, besides bronchodilation, LAMA might provide additional therapeutic effects, thereby supporting an endotype-driven approach to asthma management. The Position Paper, developed by the Asthma Section of the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, discusses the main cholinergic pathways in the lung, reviews the findings of significant clinical trials and real-life studies on LAMA use in asthma, examines the placement of these drugs in asthma clinical guidelines, and considers the potential for personalized medicine with LAMA in both adult and pediatric asthma patients.

### Inhaled corticosteroids for cystic fibrosis [^112xSJmS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

The reduction of lung inflammation is one of the goals of cystic fibrosis therapy. Inhaled corticosteroids are often used in this respect to treat children and adults with cystic fibrosis. The rationale for this is their potential to reduce lung damage arising from inflammation, as well as their effect on symptomatic wheezing. It is important to establish the level of evidence for the risks and benefits of inhaled corticosteroids, especially in light of their known adverse effects on growth. This is an update of a previously published review; however, due to the lack of research in this area, we do not envisage undertaking any further updates.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of taking regular inhaled corticosteroids compared to not taking them in children and adults with cystic fibrosis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and hand searches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We requested information from pharmaceutical companies manufacturing inhaled corticosteroids and authors of identified trials. Date of most recent search of the Group's Trials Register: 19 November 2018.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised or quasi-randomised trials, published and unpublished, comparing inhaled corticosteroids to placebo or standard treatment in individuals with cystic fibrosis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two independent authors assessed methodological quality and risk of bias.

Regarding the medical management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, particularly concerning long-acting bronchodilators, the GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend preferring LABAs and LAMAs over short-acting agents. Exceptions include patients with only occasional dyspnea and the immediate relief of symptoms in patients already on long-acting bronchodilators for maintenance therapy.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^114vPCBP]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, particularly in managing acute exacerbations, the GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend administering inhaled short-acting β-agonists, with or without short-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMAs), as the initial bronchodilators for the treatment of acute exacerbations.

### Therapeutic responses in asthma and COPD. Bronchodilators [^1147aU9S]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

The presence of acute reversibility to bronchodilators does not distinguish asthma from COPD. Patients with either condition can benefit from bronchodilators and should be given a trial to assess their response. Some respond with a change in lung volume with less hyperinflation, while others improve their forced inspiratory flow and become much more comfortable.

- **Combination therapy**: The combination of long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs) and inhaled steroids is useful in both conditions. While anticholinergics seem to yield the best results in COPD, some patients with asthma benefit from their use. Tiotropium may be the most effective agent as monotherapy in COPD, but the combination of an inhaled steroid and a LABA may produce similar results in improving lung function.

- **Monotherapy versus combination therapy**: Long-acting bronchodilators are effective agents as monotherapy in COPD, but in asthma, they should be combined with a controller medication. Short-acting beta-agonists should be used intermittently in asthma, but may be used regularly or combined with an anticholinergic in COPD.

The roles of stereoisomers, leukotriene receptor antagonists, and type 4 phosphodiesterase inhibitors in asthma and COPD remain uncertain at this time.

### Dual combination therapy versus long-acting bronchodilators alone for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116smvh5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a globally prevalent, heterogeneous lung condition characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms with spirometry values demonstrating persistent and often progressive airflow obstruction. Influential risk factors for airway obstruction include tobacco smoke exposure, environmental exposures, low body mass index, poor education levels, and a history of tuberculosis. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the disease, there are variable degrees of airway inflammation and alveolar destruction. COPD may predominantly manifest as chronic bronchitis or emphysema.

The diagnosis requires a combination of relevant clinical symptoms and a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio of less than 0.7. Clinically, the disease is characterized by chronic dyspnea, productive cough, and exposure to a risk factor. The cornerstone of COPD management is the prevention of exacerbations, which have been linked to increased morbidity and mortality.

Mortality from COPD is the third leading cause of death worldwide, and COPD accounts for over half of the chronic respiratory diseases experienced in both males and females. Because of its progressive nature, this disease continues to burden the healthcare system globally, and efforts are being made to prevent exacerbations in order to address morbidity and mortality in these individuals in a cost-effective manner.

### Rapid effects of extrafine beclomethasone dipropionate/formoterol fixed combination inhaler on airway inflammation and bronchoconstriction in asthma: A randomised controlled trial [^113MHJZx]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2011). High credibility.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the entire bronchial tree. Persistent inflammation of the airways and increased bronchial reactivity have been recognized even in mild asthma. Guidelines suggest a step-wise approach starting with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), the mainstay of asthma therapy and the most effective anti-inflammatory treatment available for persistent asthma. Corticosteroids control airway inflammation and decrease bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR), thereby reducing asthma symptoms and improving lung function. Maximal clinical benefits from corticosteroids are expected within weeks, but recent evidence suggests that ICS can exert acute effects (within hours) on airway inflammation and BHR.

There are, however, systemic side effects at high doses of ICS, and for patients uncontrolled on a medium dose of ICS, the addition of an inhaled long-acting β2-agonist (LABA) is the preferred therapy. These two classes of drugs address complementary aspects of the pathophysiology of asthma in terms of anti-inflammatory and bronchodilating effects that neither class can achieve alone. With the addition of a LABA, improvements are seen in symptom scores and lung function, along with a decrease in the number of exacerbations. The use of a LABA with an ICS achieves clinical control in more patients at a lower dose of the ICS than if the ICS were used alone.

A fixed combination of beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) and formoterol (F) (Foster®, Chiesi Farmaceutici), delivered via a hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) pressurised metered-dose inhaler (pMDI), is characterized by its rapid effects.

### Improvement in bronchodilation following deep inspiration following a course of high-dose oral prednisone in asthma [^116Nv7bw]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Bronchodilation following deep inspiration is usually impaired in patients with asthma. This impairment may result from changes in airway mechanics due to inflammation or structural changes within the airways. Although inhaled corticosteroid treatment has been shown to improve airway responses to deep inspiration in patients with asthma, airway inflammation can persist despite inhaled corticosteroid treatment, and thus could still influence the airway mechanics during deep breaths. We hypothesized that oral steroid treatment further optimizes deep inspiration-induced bronchodilation in clinically stable asthmatic patients who are already receiving therapy with inhaled corticosteroids.

- **Methods**: Twenty-four atopic patients with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma (FEV1 > 70% predicted; provocative concentration of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 [PC20] < 8 mg/mL), treated with 250 to 2,000 μg of beclomethasone-dipropionate or equivalent, participated in a parallel-design, double-blind study. Before and after treatment with 0.5 mg/kg/d prednisone or placebo for 14 days, a methacholine challenge was performed. Deep inspiration-induced bronchodilation was measured by the ratio of flow at 40% of FVC on the flow-volume curve after maximal inspiration/flow at 40% of FVC on the flow-volume curve after partial (60% of FVC) inspiration (M/P ratio).

- **Results**: The M/P ratio significantly increased from a mean of 1.31 (range, 1.0 to 1.7) to 1.49 (range, 1.1 to 2.3) in the prednisone group. Interestingly, the improvement in the M/P ratio did not correlate with an completion of the sentence.

### Therapeutic significance of distal airway inflammation in asthma [^112q15e5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2002). High credibility.

Inflammation in asthma is not merely confined to the large central airways but also extends to the small peripheral airways. Distal lung inflammation can be observed even in patients with asthma with mild disease and normal spirometric readings. Subjects with asymptomatic asthma can exhibit significant increases in peripheral airway resistance, likely the result of distal lung inflammation.

As determined from measurements of eosinophilic and other cellular infiltrates, the inflammatory response in the distal lung can exceed that in the large airways. Nocturnal asthma, a natural model of cyclic asthma worsening, is associated with an increase in nighttime distal lung inflammation, as evidenced by the accumulation of alveolar tissue eosinophils.

Distal lung disease appears to increase the risk of asthma exacerbation, whereas disease-related anatomic changes in the small airways of the distal lung are prominent in fatal asthma. The clinical significance of distal lung disease makes this region an important therapeutic target.

- **Inhaled corticosteroids**: Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)-based preparations of inhaled corticosteroids used to treat airway inflammation produce aerosols of relatively large particle size (approximately 4 microm); such aerosols have poor access to the distal lung. New formulations of inhaled corticosteroids that use hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) propellants can have smaller particle sizes (approximately 1 microm). Extrafine HFA aerosols have better access to the distal lung, with less oropharyngeal deposition.

Imaging studies suggest that anti-inflammatory medication delivered as an aerosol is effective in addressing distal lung inflammation.

### COPD: Current therapeutic interventions and future approaches [^1112gXm3]. The European Respiratory Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Although long-acting bronchodilators have been an important advance for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), these drugs do not address the underlying inflammatory process. Currently, there are no treatments available that reduce the progression of COPD or suppress the inflammation in small airways and lung parenchyma. Several new treatments targeting the inflammatory process are now in clinical development. Some therapies, such as chemokine antagonists, are aimed at the influx of inflammatory cells into the airways and lung parenchyma that occurs in COPD, while others target inflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-alpha.

Broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory drugs, including phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors, are now in phase III development for COPD. Additional drugs that inhibit cell signaling include inhibitors of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, nuclear factor-kappaB, and phosphoinositide-3 kinase-gamma. More specific approaches involve the use of antioxidants, inhibitors of inducible nitric oxide synthase, and leukotriene B4 antagonists. Other treatments aim to combat mucus hypersecretion, and there is also ongoing research for serine proteinase and matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors to prevent lung destruction and the development of emphysema.

More research is needed to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and to develop biomarkers and monitoring techniques to aid the development of new therapies.

### Can we treat airway remodeling [^115WEknH]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic disease associated with structural changes of the airway wall. These changes lead to decreased reversibility of airway obstruction and have been generally understood as poorly reversible. Recent studies have proven that some processes involved in airway remodeling may be reversible with early detection of the disease and appropriate anti-inflammatory treatment. New treatments should be directed not only against inflammation itself but also against these chronic changes.

### Do chronic inhaled steroids alone or in combination with a bronchodilator prolong life in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients [^114jWU5R]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids, with or without long-acting beta2 adrenergic agonists, are commonly used to treat patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, aiming to attenuate symptoms and prevent exacerbations. However, whether these medications prolong survival remains uncertain.

Recent findings indicate that inhaled corticosteroids can attenuate airway and systemic inflammation, reduce airway hyperreactivity, improve patient symptoms, and prevent exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. The data on mortality are mixed. A pooled analysis of published randomized controlled trials indicated that inhaled corticosteroids reduced mortality by around 25%; however, other studies have failed to show a beneficial effect on mortality. The addition of long-acting beta2 adrenergic agonists to inhaled corticosteroids enhances the clinical effectiveness of these medications and confers incremental mortality benefits to patients. Interestingly, these medications appear to be especially beneficial in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, though large randomized controlled trials powered specifically on these endpoints are needed to confirm these early findings.

In summary, inhaled corticosteroids, especially when combined with long-acting beta2 adrenergic agonists, reduce airway inflammation and appear to prolong survival in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. They may be particularly effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of patients, pending confirmation by additional clinical studies powered specifically on these endpoints.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating effects of lebrikizumab on airway eosinophilic inflammation and remodelling in uncontrolled asthma (CLAVIER) [^112V7rpn]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2020). High credibility.

Eligible patients were aged 18‐75 years with a clinical diagnosis of asthma for at least 12 months prior to visit 1, documented bronchodilator reversibility (≥ 12% relative improvement) within 12 months prior to or during screening, and a pre-bronchodilator FEV1 of 40%–80% predicted at both screening visits 2 and 3. Patients were receiving a total daily dose of 500‐2000 μg of fluticasone propionate DPI or equivalent and were on an eligible second controller medication for at least 6 months prior to visit 1, with no changes within 4 weeks prior to visit 1. Eligible second asthma controller medications included LABAs, leukotriene receptor antagonists, long‐acting muscarinic antagonists, or theophylline. Doses for ICS and second controllers needed to remain stable throughout the study, except for theophylline which could be adjusted based on blood levels.

Uncontrolled asthma during screening was defined as a five‐item Asthma Control Questionnaire score of ≥ 1.5 and at least one of the following: daytime symptoms on more than 2 days per week, night‐time awakening at least one night per week, rescue medication use on at least 2 days per week, and/or interference with normal daily activities. Patients had to have documented absence of other clinically significant lung disease and demonstrate adherence to controller medication during screening. Key exclusion criteria are listed in the Supplement.

All patients provided written informed consent prior to study participation. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation Guidance for Good Clinical Practice.

### Novel antiinflammatory therapies for COPD [^116g1VwN]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

The biologic nature of COPD inflammation is not well understood, and agents that inhibit inflammation in COPD remain a major unmet need. However, a variety of agents with the potential to inhibit COPD inflammation are at various stages of development. Agents that have been approved for non-COPD indications but show potential for inhibiting COPD inflammation include statins, some phosphodiesterase inhibitors, certain long-acting β agonists, tiotropium bromide, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ agonist rosiglitazone, and various monoclonal antibodies.

New molecular entities specifically developed as antiinflammatory agents for COPD include an array of chemokine receptor antagonists, inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases, inhibitors of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases, and stem cells. Additionally, some innovative agents are in preclinical or early clinical stages of investigation.

### "As-needed" inhaled corticosteroids for patients with asthma [^1148QtHg]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). High credibility.

Prevention of severe asthma exacerbations is a primary management goal for asthma across the severity spectrum. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) decrease the risk of asthma exacerbations. However, patient adherence to ICS-containing medications as a daily maintenance therapy is poor, and many patients overuse short-acting beta-2 agonist relievers, both of which are associated with an increased risk of severe exacerbations and death. Airway inflammation also varies over time, influenced by exposures such as viral infections and allergens.

As-needed ICS strategies, in which patients receive ICSs (or additional ICSs, if already taking controller therapy) whenever they take their reliever inhaler, empower patients to adjust their ICS intake in response to symptom fluctuation. These strategies can improve asthma morbidity outcomes, particularly by reducing severe exacerbations and reducing the risk of adverse effects of oral corticosteroids.

In this review, the evidence for combination ICS-formoterol in a single inhaler, ICS and short-acting beta-2 agonists in separate inhalers, and combination ICS-albuterol in a single inhaler is presented. Practical considerations, evidence gaps, and implications for clinical practice for each strategy are discussed, presented by level of asthma severity and age group. Improving access to such strategies on a global scale is imperative to improve asthma outcomes and achieve equity across populations.

### Can inhaled fluticasone alone or in combination with salmeterol reduce systemic inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease? Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial [NCT00120978] [^114uXv14]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Systemic inflammation is associated with various complications in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, including weight loss, cachexia, osteoporosis, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. Inhaled corticosteroids attenuate airway inflammation, reduce exacerbations, and improve mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Whether inhaled corticosteroids by themselves or in combination with a long-acting β2-adrenoceptor agonist repress systemic inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is unknown. The Advair Biomarkers in COPD (ABC) study will determine whether the effects of inhaled corticosteroids alone or in combination with a long-acting β2-adrenoceptor agonist reduce systemic inflammation and improve health status in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

- **Methods/design**: After a 4-week run-in phase during which patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease will receive inhaled fluticasone (500 micrograms twice daily), followed by a 4-week withdrawal phase during which all inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β2-adrenoceptor agonists will be discontinued, patients will be randomized to receive fluticasone (500 micrograms twice daily), fluticasone/salmeterol combination (500/50 micrograms twice daily), or placebo for four weeks. The study will recruit 250 patients across 11 centers in western Canada. Patients must be 40 years of age or older with at least a 10 pack-year smoking history and have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease defined as a forced expiratory volume in one second to vital capacity ratio of 0.

### Toward a predict and prevent approach in obstructive airway diseases [^1167hkty]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). High credibility.

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are currently diagnosed and treated after the demonstration of variable airflow limitation and symptoms. Under this framework, undiagnosed and unchecked airway inflammation is associated with acute attacks, airway remodeling, airflow limitation, adverse effects of corticosteroids, and impaired quality of life, ultimately leading to the collection of side effects termed "people remodeling". This one-size-fits-all damage control approach aims to control symptoms and treat exacerbations rather than modify the underlying disease process.

The advent of highly effective therapies targeting proximal drivers of airway inflammation calls for a paradigm shift; upstream-acting therapies offer potential to alter the disease course and achieve clinical remission. We propose moving away from downstream firefighting and toward a "predict and prevent" model, measuring inflammation and providing anti-inflammatory therapy early, without waiting for further clinical deterioration. Much in the same way that high blood pressure and cholesterol are used to predict and prevent heart attacks, in asthma, elevated blood eosinophils and/or exhaled nitric oxide can be used to predict and prevent asthma attacks. We also advocate moving research further upstream by identifying patients with subclinical airway inflammation or disease who may be at risk of progressing to airflow limitation and associated morbidities, and intervening early to prevent them.

In summary, we call for a predict and prevent approach in obstructive airway disease.

### Inhaled corticosteroids in obstructive airway disease [^114pHVQC]. Respiratory Care (2007). Low credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids play an important role in the management of obstructive airway disease by suppressing airway inflammation, which is central to the pathophysiology of these conditions. In asthma, there is strong clinical evidence supporting the use of inhaled corticosteroids in mild, moderate, and severe persistent asthma to improve lung function, reduce exacerbations, and prevent death. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, inhaled corticosteroids improve symptoms and reduce the frequency of exacerbations and hospitalizations. They should be considered in patients with moderate-to-severe airflow limitation who have persistent symptoms despite optimal bronchodilator therapy. Although the adverse effects of corticosteroids are less pronounced when given via inhalation compared to systemic administration, they are still significant and need to be considered. Newer inhaled corticosteroids with better pharmacologic properties are being developed and are likely to be available in the near future.

### How do dual long-acting bronchodilators prevent exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112v7dHk]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Decreasing the frequency and severity of exacerbations is one of the main goals of treatment for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Several studies have documented that long-acting bronchodilators can reduce exacerbation rate and/or severity. Others have shown that combinations of long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists (LABAs) and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) provide greater reductions in exacerbation frequency than either their monocomponents or LABA/inhaled corticosteroid combinations in patients at low and high risk for these events.

In this review, small groups of experts critically evaluated mechanisms potentially responsible for the increased benefit of LABA/LAMA combinations over single long-acting bronchodilators or LABA/inhaled corticosteroids in decreasing exacerbation. These included effects on lung hyperinflation and mechanical stress, inflammation, excessive mucus production with impaired mucociliary clearance, and symptom severity. The data assembled and analyzed by each group were reviewed by all authors and combined into this manuscript.

Available clinical results support the possibility that effects of LABA/LAMA combinations on hyperinflation, mucociliary clearance, and symptom severity may all contribute to decreasing exacerbations. Although preclinical studies suggest LABAs and LAMAs have anti-inflammatory effects, such effects have not been demonstrated yet in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^111mnGKL]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, more specifically with respect to short-acting bronchodilators, GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend administering inhaled short-acting β-agonists, with or without SAMAs, as the initial bronchodilators for the treatment of acute exacerbations.

### Inhaled corticosteroid dose response in asthma: Should we measure inflammation [^116zomJA]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) titration in asthma is primarily based on symptoms and pulmonary function. However, ICSs may not be increased on this basis despite residual airway inflammation.

- **Objective**: To compare the dose-response relationships of ICSs on measures of pulmonary function, symptoms, and inflammation in patients with persistent asthma.

- **Methods**: We performed a pooled post hoc analysis of 121 patients with mild to moderate asthma from four randomized clinical trials that incorporated an ICS dose ramp. Dose ramps were 0 to 200, 0 to 800, and 200 to 800 μg/d (beclomethasone equivalents). Outcome measures included spirometry, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), symptoms, serum eosinophilic cationic protein, and blood eosinophils.

- **Results**: We found a plateau beyond a small improvement at 0 to 200 μg for forced expiratory volume in 1 second: 3.3% (95% confidence interval, 2.0%-4.7%) at 0 to 200 μg vs 0.3% (95% CI, -0.8% to 1.4%) for 200 to 800 μg (P = 0.001). A similar plateau was seen for symptom improvement beyond 0 to 200 μg. Inflammatory and AHR outcomes revealed further room for improvement beyond low-dose ICSs. There was dose-related suppression (P < .001) for fractional exhaled nitric oxide: 40.4 ppb (95% CI, 34.7–46.9 ppb) for ICS free, 26.8 ppb (95% CI, 23.4–30.2 ppb) for 200 μg, and 20.8 ppb (95% CI, 18.8–23.1 ppb) for 800 μg. Eosinophilic cationic protein concentration was significantly reduced with both higher dose ramps. Eosinophil counts also improved across all three dose ramps, with dose separation of 370/μL (95% CI, 280–4).

### Structural changes in airway diseases: characteristics, mechanisms, consequences, and pharmacologic modulation [^114Zno5J]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

In airway diseases such as asthma and COPD, specific structural changes may be observed, very likely secondary to an underlying inflammatory process. Although it is still controversial, airway remodeling may contribute to the development of these diseases and to their clinical expression and outcome.

Airway remodeling has been described in asthma in various degrees of severity, and correlations have been found between such features as an increase in subepithelial collagen or proteoglycan deposits and airway responsiveness. Although the clinical significance of airway remodeling remains a matter of debate, it has been suggested as a potential target for treatments aimed at reducing asthma severity, improving its control, and possibly preventing its development.

At the time of writing, drugs used to treat airway diseases have little influence on airway structural changes. More research should be done to identify key changes, valuable treatments, and proper interventional timing to counteract these changes. The potential of novel therapeutic agents to reverse or prevent airway remodeling is an exciting avenue and warrants further evaluation.

### Blood cell for the differentiation of airway inflammatory phenotypes in COPD exacerbations [^116ujKtM]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common, preventable, and treatable disease characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities, usually caused by significant exposure to noxious particles or gases. Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) are defined as an acute worsening of respiratory symptoms that result in additional therapy. These are important events in COPD management because they negatively impact health status, rates of hospitalization and readmission, and disease progression.

Chronic airway inflammation in COPD exacerbations involves increased numbers of inflammatory cells, such as neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes, which respond to different parts of the lung and lead to structural changes. Specific airway inflammatory cell types reflect different airway inflammatory phenotypes. Typically, COPD exacerbation is linked to a neutrophilic signature response. This shared pathway probably represents half of COPD patients. Conversely, COPD with eosinophilia (sputum eosinophilia > 3%) is present in 10–40% of patients. Eosinophilic COPD shows a favorable response to corticosteroid therapy, and eosinophilic inflammatory airway disease may highlight different genetic, biologic, and pathologic processes with increased all-cause mortality.

Four airway inflammatory subgroups were defined by the percentage of eosinophils and neutrophils in sputum.

### Can inhaled corticosteroids prevent asthma exacerbations [^112xBPT5]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Asthma exacerbations occur unpredictably, resulting in morbidity and mortality, and contribute significantly to increased healthcare costs. Inhaled corticosteroids reduce exacerbations and improve quality of life.

Recent findings indicate that the aetiopathology of asthma exacerbations is heterogeneous. Attempts to phenotype the heterogeneity of airway inflammation patterns through noninvasive monitoring have identified a subgroup of patients with eosinophilic inflammation who are most likely to respond to steroid therapy. Strategies focused on normalizing eosinophilic airway inflammation with corticosteroids have consistently led to a marked reduction in exacerbations. In contrast, their role in modulating the natural history of the disease is less certain.

In the near future, improvements in our understanding of the mechanisms of exacerbations may identify therapeutic targets. While we await these developments, inhaled corticosteroids remain the first choice anti-inflammatory therapy for asthma.

### Can inhaled fluticasone alone or in combination with salmeterol reduce systemic inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease? Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial [NCT00120978] [^114yBVtg]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids reduce serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and other circulating inflammatory cytokine levels in COPD. They also downregulate certain inflammatory cells and cytokine levels in the airways of COPD patients. Whether inhaled steroids can reduce circulating CRP levels in stable COPD is less certain. A pilot randomized clinical trial of 41 patients with COPD indicated that withdrawal of inhaled corticosteroids increased serum CRP levels by approximately 70%, whereas a two-week treatment with inhaled fluticasone reduced CRP levels by about 50%. These findings are consistent with a recently published observational study by Pinto-Plata and colleagues, who found that users of inhaled corticosteroids had serum CRP levels that were, on average, approximately 40% lower than those among corticosteroid non-users.

Recent experimental evidence indicates that long-acting β2-adrenoceptor agonists on their own can promote the translocation of the glucocorticoid receptor complexes from the cytosol to the nucleus, a process critical for effectuating the anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids. When long-acting β2-adrenoceptor agonists are added to corticosteroids, the rate of glucocorticoid receptor translocation may be accelerated. Moreover, Zhu and colleagues demonstrated in a randomized controlled trial of 140 patients with moderate to severe COPD that 12 weeks of treatment with salmeterol plus fluticasone decreased tissue expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interferon (IFN)-γ in the larger airways. They also found that combination therapy decreased sputum eosinophil levels (p = 0.03).

### Endogenous lipid mediators in the resolution of airway inflammation [^112MToJt]. The European Respiratory Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Acute inflammation in the lung is fundamentally important to host defence, but chronic or excessive inflammation leads to several common respiratory diseases, including asthma and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The resolution of inflammation is an active process. In health, events at the onset of acute inflammation establish biosynthetic circuits for specific chemical mediators that later serve as agonists to orchestrate a return to tissue homeostasis. In addition to an overabundance of pro-inflammatory stimuli, pathological inflammation can also result from defects in resolution signalling. The understanding of anti-inflammatory, pro-resolution molecules and their counter-regulatory signalling pathways is providing new insights into the molecular pathophysiology of lung disease and opportunities for the design of therapeutic strategies.

In the present review, the growing family of lipid mediators of resolution is examined, including lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, cyclopentenones, and presqualene diphosphate. Roles are uncovered for these compounds, or their structural analogues, in regulating airway inflammation.

### PDE4 inhibitors in COPD — a more selective approach to treatment [^114Aryao]. Respiratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a serious and mounting global public health problem. Although its pathogenesis is incompletely understood, chronic inflammation plays an important role, and new therapies with a novel anti-inflammatory mechanism of action may benefit the treatment of COPD. Cilomilast and roflumilast are potent and selective phosphodiesterase (PDE)4 inhibitors with an improved therapeutic index compared to the weak, non-selective PDE inhibitor, theophylline. Unlike theophylline, which is limited by poor efficacy, safety, and tolerability, the selective PDE4 inhibitors are generally well-tolerated. They have demonstrated efficacy in improving lung function, decreasing the rate of exacerbations, and enhancing quality of life, with proven anti-inflammatory effects in patients with COPD.

Theophylline is a challenging drug to use clinically, requiring careful titration and routine plasma monitoring due to the risk of toxic side effects, such as cardiovascular and central nervous system adverse events. Dose adjustments may be necessary for many patients, including smokers, the elderly, and some patients on concomitant medications. In contrast, the selective PDE4 inhibitors are convenient medications for both the patient and physician. These agents represent a therapeutic advance in the treatment of COPD due to their novel mechanism of action, potent anti-inflammatory effects, and good safety and tolerability profile.

### Contribution of small airway inflammation to the development of COPD [^1177zupt]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

We postulated that the accumulation of inflammation may be a culprit in impairing pulmonary function and structural changes in COPD. The pathophysiological changes of central and peripheral airway inflammation in COPD development are commonly identified by invasive techniques such as biopsies or operations. Nitric oxide (NO) is a biomarker of airway inflammation and aids in refining methods to discriminate exhaled NO sources from the lung. In the study, the partitioned airway inflammation leading to COPD development was investigated using measurements of exhaled NO, including FnNO (the nasal NO at a concentration of 10 mL/s), FeNO 50 (exhaled NO at a concentration of 50 mL/s), FeNO 200 (exhaled NO at a concentration of 200 mL/s), and calculated CaNO (dual-flow CaNO). Both FeNO 200 and CaNO dual were compared to determine which provided a better value for assessing peripheral airway/alveolar inflammation in COPD. The correlation between exhaled NO and white cell classification was evaluated to identify the type of inflammation during the development of COPD.

### Small airway inflammation and extrafine inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta-agonists formulations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113439wq]. Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

To summarize the evidence of small airways involvement in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) pathophysiology, and to evaluate the efficacy of extrafine formulations of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in combination with long-acting beta 2-agonists (LABAs) in the treatment of COPD.

- **Data source**: A search of the PubMed database was conducted using the keywords "COPD", "small airways", "inflammation" and "extrafine formulation". The search was limited to entries published in English before August 2016. Only studies conducted in humans were considered.

- **Study selection**: Publications were included on the basis of relevance.

- **Results**: COPD is a common, preventable, and treatable disease characterized by persistent and progressive airflow limitation. With improved understanding of COPD pathophysiology, small airways (internal diameter < 2 mm), a well-known major site of COPD-associated inflammation and remodeling, have emerged as a potential target for COPD pharmacologic therapies. The ability of extrafine formulations of ICS in combination with LABAs to achieve central and peripheral lung deposition, and the implications of the enhanced efficacy that this may bring, are discussed by examining findings from the development trials plan of the extrafine formulation of beclometasone dipropionate/formoterol fumarate (Foster®, Chiesi Farmaceutici, Italy) in patients with COPD.

There is an urgent need for improved and reliable techniques for small airways assessment in order to detect early damage, disease progression, and response to treatment.

### Inhaled corticosteroids for cystic fibrosis [^117LbP6P]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Reduction of lung inflammation is one of the goals of cystic fibrosis therapy. Inhaled corticosteroids are often used to treat children and adults with cystic fibrosis. The rationale for this is their potential to reduce lung damage arising from inflammation, as well as their effect on symptomatic wheezing. It is important to establish the level of evidence for the risks and benefits of inhaled corticosteroids, especially in light of their known adverse effects on growth.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of taking regular inhaled corticosteroids, compared to not taking them, in children and adults with cystic fibrosis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We requested information from pharmaceutical companies manufacturing inhaled corticosteroids and authors of identified trials. The date of the most recent search of the Group's Trials Register: 17 July 2014.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised or quasi-randomised trials, published and unpublished, comparing inhaled corticosteroids to placebo or standard treatment in individuals with cystic fibrosis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two independent authors assessed methodological quality and risk of bias in trials using established criteria and extracted data using standard pro formas.

- **Main results**: The searches identified 34 citations, of which 26 (representing 13 trials) were included in the analysis.

### The effects of inhaled corticosteroids on healthy airways [^113y24cR]. Allergy (2024). Low credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the cornerstone of asthma treatment. They attenuate eosinophilic airway inflammation, improve lung function, and reduce asthma symptoms, exacerbations, and mortality. However, their use is also associated with an increased risk of pneumonia. Corticosteroids modulate the expression of many molecular pathways at the level of gene transcription, through direct upregulation of anti-inflammatory molecules and β-adrenoceptors (transactivation), and suppression of pro-inflammatory genes, either through direct DNA-binding or via inhibition of pro-inflammatory transcription factor binding (transrepression).

In people with severe asthma, ICS are relatively ineffective even at high doses, but the mechanisms behind this corticosteroid insensitivity are poorly understood and likely multi-factorial. When considering the underlying molecular pathways driving both severe asthma and relative corticosteroid insensitivity, it is unclear to what extent this is driven by pathways that are not responsive to corticosteroids, as opposed to inhibition of corticosteroid signalling. Gene expression profiling in asthmatic epithelial bronchial brushings and bronchial biopsies has identified several molecular pathways present in subgroups of patients with mild, moderate, and severe asthma. Approximately 50–80% of people with steroid-naïve "mild" asthma demonstrate evidence of blood or airway eosinophilia, with a concomitant increase in the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO). This phenotype is characterised by increased expression of an airway gene.

### Effects of inhaled corticosteroids on sputum cell counts in stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A systematic review and a meta-analysis [^113idohD]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by prominent airway inflammation. The intensity of the inflammation strongly correlates with disease severity and increases even further during exacerbations. Moreover, increased expression of inflammatory markers in the sputum is associated with an increased risk of exacerbations. The attenuation of the inflammatory process, on the other hand, is associated with improvements in lung function and airway hyperresponsiveness in COPD. It is possible, therefore, that the inflammatory process is an integral component in COPD pathogenesis and may represent an important therapeutic target in improving the health status and outcomes of COPD patients.

One potential therapy for down-regulating the inflammatory process in the airways is the use of corticosteroids, which are potent but non-specific anti-inflammatory agents. Some in vitro studies have demonstrated that inhaled corticosteroids can modulate certain aspects of the inflammatory cascade in COPD; however, other studies have shown less favorable results. Despite this uncertainty, large clinical trials have shown that these medications reduce clinically relevant exacerbations by approximately 30% and improve the health status of patients with moderate to severe disease; their withdrawal, on the other hand, leads to an increased risk of exacerbations and worsening of health status. Since airway inflammation is associated with exacerbations and since inhaled corticosteroids reduce exacerbations, they may also have a salutary effect on airway inflammation in COPD.

### Effects of inhaled corticosteroids on sputum cell counts in stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review and a meta-analysis [^114DMf6e]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Whether inhaled corticosteroids suppress airway inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains controversial. We sought to determine the effects of inhaled corticosteroids on sputum indices of inflammation in stable COPD.

- **Methods**: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Databases for randomized, controlled clinical trials that used induced sputum to evaluate the effect of inhaled corticosteroids in stable COPD. For each chosen study, we calculated the mean differences in the concentrations of sputum cells before and after treatment in both intervention and control groups. These values were then converted into standardized mean differences to accommodate the differences in patient selection, clinical treatment, and biochemical procedures employed across original studies. If significant heterogeneity was present (p < 0.10), a random-effects model was used to pool data.

- **Results**: Studies utilizing a higher cumulative dose (≥ 60 mg) or longer duration of therapy (≥ 6 weeks) found that inhaled corticosteroids were uniformly effective in reducing the total cell, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts. In contrast, studies with lower cumulative doses (< 60 mg) or shorter durations of therapy (< 6 weeks) did not demonstrate a favorable effect of inhaled corticosteroids on these sputum indices.

- **Conclusions**: Our study suggests that prolonged therapy with inhaled corticosteroids may be beneficial in stable COPD by reducing airway inflammation, as reflected in sputum cell counts.

### Improving asthma management: The case for mandatory inclusion of dose counters on all rescue bronchodilators [^113HW5yS]. The Journal of Asthma (2013). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory condition of the airways, characterized by limited airflow and punctuated by acute symptoms related to hyperresponsiveness to a variety of "triggers", such as allergens or fumes. Chronic inflammation of the airways can lead to persistent alterations in airway structure, including sub-basement membrane fibrosis, mucus hypersecretion, injury to epithelial cells, smooth muscle hypertrophy, and angiogenesis. Asthma symptoms include wheezing, dyspnea, coughing, and chest tightness associated with broad but variable airflow obstruction in the lungs. During acute asthma events, symptom severity may range from mild to life-threatening due to severe bronchospasm, airway edema, impaired gas exchange, and ultimately, respiratory failure.

Asthma continues to be a serious global health challenge. Worldwide, an estimated 300 million people suffer from the disease, and prevalence is increasing. Of the 25 million Americans with asthma, 12 million experience acute symptoms, and asthma was linked to 3,447 deaths (about 9 per day) in 2007. Asthma symptoms account for about 500,000 hospitalizations and nearly 2 million emergency room visits per year in the United States.

### The pathophysiology of airway dysfunction [^1126RZe4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are distinct inflammatory disorders with differing pathophysiologic mechanisms, clinical courses, and, therefore, distinct treatment strategies. In asthma, airflow limitation is typically episodic and reversible, whereas in COPD, it is progressive and only partially reversible. Asthma is characterized by an elevated number of eosinophils in the blood and the accumulation of activated eosinophils, mast cells, and CD4+ T(H)2-lymphocytes in the lungs. In contrast, the primary inflammatory cells present in the lungs of patients with stable COPD are neutrophils, macrophages, and CD8+ lymphocytes.

Bronchoconstriction in COPD is largely regulated by cholinergically mediated vagal tone, and the pathologic processes of COPD further reduce airway patency. Bronchodilators, most notably anticholinergics, are recommended as first-line pharmacologic therapy for COPD. Proper use of inhaled anticholinergic medications has been shown to lead to significant reversibility of acetylcholine-mediated bronchoconstriction during both stable disease and exacerbations of COPD.

For patients with asthma, guidelines recommend anti-inflammatory medications, specifically inhaled corticosteroids and leukotriene-modifiers, as first-line therapy, making these agents the mainstay of asthma therapy. In contrast, the guidelines for COPD management recommend that inhaled anti-inflammatory agents be tried in patients with COPD only as second-line therapy for patients who have severe to ver.

### Pharmacotherapy and airway remodelling in asthma [^113aZMr2]. Thorax (2003). Low credibility.

Over the last few decades, attention has largely focused on airway inflammation in asthma. More recently, it has been appreciated that there are important structural airway changes, grouped together under the term "airway remodelling". It is only now that questions have been asked about the impact of treatment on these structural changes. This review examines the nature of these structural airway changes, the mechanisms of their generation, their potential consequences, and what is known about the ability of anti-asthma treatments to modulate these changes.

### State of progress in treating cystic fibrosis respiratory disease [^115MjHRu]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The inflammatory response in the airways of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is excessive and is thought to overwhelm the natural protective mechanisms of the airway. This excessive and persistent inflammation is likely the main cause of airway destruction over time, suggesting that anti-inflammatory therapy could benefit the progression of CF airway disease.

Chronic administration of oral prednisone has been shown to improve pulmonary function in children with CF but also results in significant growth impairment in a population already facing growth challenges. Inhaled corticosteroids may reduce the potential for adverse effects. However, the evidence for the benefit of chronic inhalation of corticosteroids is conflicting. There has never been a randomized controlled trial demonstrating the treatment benefit of inhaled corticosteroids, although a controlled study has shown that withdrawal of the inhaled corticosteroid fluticasone was not linked to an increased rate of exacerbation or reduced pulmonary function during a six-month post-withdrawal period. Two retrospective CF registry analyses have independently shown an association between chronic inhaled corticosteroid use and a reduced rate of lung function decline over several years. This suggests that short-term measures of respiratory health may not be perfect surrogates for longer-term disease progression. US chronic respiratory therapy guidelines recommend against the use of inhaled corticosteroids in such cases.

### Prostanoids in asthma and COPD: Actions, dysregulation, and therapeutic opportunities [^112cnD5P]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

Pathophysiologic gaps in the actions of currently available treatments for asthma and COPD include neutrophilic inflammation, airway remodeling, and alveolar destruction. All of these processes can be modulated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate-elevating prostaglandins E2 and I2 (also known as prostacyclin). These prostanoids have long been known to elicit bronchodilation and to protect against bronchoconstriction provoked by a variety of stimuli. Much less well known is their capacity to inhibit inflammatory responses involving activation of lymphocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils, as well as to attenuate epithelial injury and mesenchymal cell activation. This profile of actions identifies prostanoids as attractive candidates for exogenous administration in asthma.

By contrast, excessive prostanoid production and signaling might contribute to both the increased susceptibility to infections that drive COPD exacerbations and the inadequate alveolar repair that characterizes emphysema. Inhibition of endogenous prostanoid synthesis or signaling, thus, has therapeutic potential for these types of patients. By virtue of their pleiotropic capacity to modulate numerous pathophysiologic processes relevant to the expression and natural history of airway diseases, prostanoids emerge as attractive targets for therapeutic manipulation.

### Multidimensional assessment and tailored interventions for COPD: Respiratory utopia or common sense [^114PwBkX]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

Airway and systemic inflammation in COPD is heterogeneous, and since any one person can exhibit more than one inflammatory process, any individual may require more than one therapeutic approach. For example, targeting neutrophilic inflammation alone will treat 57% of people with COPD. Targeting eosinophilic inflammation will treat a further 34%, and targeting systemic inflammation will manage this problem in 59% of the COPD group. Drug therapy is increasingly pathway specific, and targeting all of these different pathways in all people with COPD would require three drugs: macrolide, statin, and corticosteroid. A less costly and potentially safer approach is to use individual assessment and multicomponent therapy. We have developed a multifaceted approach that is likely to be highly effective and may be safer.

The additive effects of targeted anti-inflammatory treatment to eosinophilic, neutrophilic, and systemic inflammation should show at least cumulative benefits and result in a greater proportion of the COPD population receiving effective anti-inflammatory therapy. We recognise that anti-inflammatory treatment in COPD needs to balance the nature of inflammation, treatment efficacy, and the potential for adverse effects. For example, the broad application of macrolides is effective, but there is a concern about side effects and microbial resistance. Consequently, an individually targeted approach may be a better way to maximise efficacy and minimise side effects.

### Adverse outcomes associated with short-acting beta-agonist overuse in asthma: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111iH88S]. Allergy (2025). Low credibility.

Asthma management aims to control clinical symptoms, reduce future exacerbations, and prevent fixed airway obstruction. Decreasing comorbidities and minimizing adverse effects from medications are also important in the treatment course. Short-acting beta-agonists (SABA) have a rapid-onset bronchodilatory effect and have been used to treat acute asthma symptoms for the past 30 years. In 2019, the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) introduced a novel treatment strategy: SABA monotherapy was no longer recommended for mild asthma. Instead, a combination of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and formoterol inhalers was recommended for all patients with asthma to relieve acute symptoms and reduce chronic airway inflammation concomitantly. Meanwhile, ICS-formoterol has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of exacerbations compared to SABA monotherapy. Likewise, ICS-albuterol has been considered a choice of asthma rescue therapy after the approval of the US Food and Drug Administration. In the MANDALA trial, as-needed albuterol-budesonide 180/160 mg pressurized metered-dose inhalers significantly reduced the risk of severe exacerbations by 27% compared with as-needed albuterol alone.

Despite updated GINA recommendations, SABA overuse (≥ 3 canisters annually) remains prevalent. The global study by the SABA use IN Asthma program (SABINA) has demonstrated the disease burden associated with SABA overuse among patients with asthma across multiple countries. Studies indicate that SABA overuse is often linked to ICS underuse and inadequate control of underlying airway inflammation.

### The effect of long-acting beta2-agonists on airway inflammation in asthmatic patients [^113WDL37]. Respiratory Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Early observations suggested that the inhibition by long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs) of non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness following allergen challenge was unrelated to bronchodilation or functional antagonism and might be a reflection of anti-inflammatory activity. Investigation of the effect of LABAs on airway inflammatory responses has demonstrated an inhibition of eosinophil recruitment in allergen challenge studies. Nevertheless, results from biopsy and other studies suggest that the chronic inflammatory process in asthma patients is unaffected by these drugs. There is no evidence from biopsy studies that LABAs are pro-inflammatory or that they mask existing inflammation. The beneficial effects of LABAs in allergen challenge are probably mediated through stabilization of mast cells. Recent evidence suggests that LABAs may reduce numbers of neutrophils and their associated markers; this observation needs to be confirmed in future studies and its relevance to the treatment of asthma determined.

### Can inhaled fluticasone alone or in combination with salmeterol reduce systemic inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease? Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial [NCT00120978] [^116FZFyG]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Systemic inflammation is associated with various complications in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, including weight loss, cachexia, osteoporosis, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. Inhaled corticosteroids attenuate airway inflammation, reduce exacerbations, and improve mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Whether inhaled corticosteroids by themselves or in combination with a long-acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonist repress systemic inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is unknown. The Advair Biomarkers in COPD (ABC) study will determine whether the effects of inhaled corticosteroids alone or in combination with a long-acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonist reduce systemic inflammation and improve health status in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

- **Methods/Design**: After a 4-week run-in phase during which patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease will receive inhaled fluticasone (500 micrograms twice daily), followed by a 4-week withdrawal phase during which all inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonists will be discontinued, patients will be randomized to receive fluticasone (500 micrograms twice daily), fluticasone/salmeterol combination (500/50 micrograms twice daily), or placebo for four weeks. The study will recruit 250 patients across 11 centers in western Canada. Patients must be 40 years of age or older with at least a 10 pack-year smoking history and have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease defined as forced expiratory volume in one second to vital capacity ratio.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the airway microbiome: A review for clinicians [^113CpFBb]. Respiratory Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex, heterogeneous condition characterized by progressive airflow limitation and chronic inflammation. The progressive development and long-term repeated acute exacerbation of COPD make many patients still unable to control the deterioration of the disease after active treatment, even eventually leading to death. An increasing number of studies have shown that the occurrence and development of COPD are closely related to the composition and changes in the airway microbiome.

This article reviews the interaction between COPD and the airway microbiome, the potential mechanisms of interaction, and related treatment methods. We elaborate on the internal correlation between the airway microbiome and different stages of COPD, including inflammatory endotypes and glucocorticoid and antibiotic treatment.

- **Pathophysiological mechanisms**: We analyze mechanisms such as the "vicious cycle" hypothesis, abnormal inflammation-immune response of the host, and the "natural selection" of COPD on the airway microbiome.

- **Treatment of COPD related to the microbiome**: We introduce microbiome-related COPD treatments and emphasize the predictive value of the airway microbiome for the progression, exacerbation, and prognosis of COPD. Furthermore, we highlight the guiding role of the microbiome in the clinical management of patients.

These insights aim to provide a new perspective for exploring the pathogenesis of COPD and offer clues and guidance for identifying new treatment targets.

### Effects of budesonide and formoterol on allergen-induced airway responses, inflammation, and airway remodeling in asthma [^11571euy]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Combining inhaled corticosteroids with long-acting beta(2)-agonists results in improved asthma symptom control and fewer asthma exacerbations compared with those seen after inhaled corticosteroids alone. However, there are limited data as to whether these beneficial effects are due to enhanced anti-inflammatory actions or whether such combination therapies affect airway remodeling in patients with asthma.

- **Objective**: We sought to determine the effects of inhaled budesonide/formoterol combination therapy versus inhaled budesonide alone or inhaled placebo on allergen-induced airway responses, airway inflammation, and airway remodeling.

- **Methods**: Fourteen asthmatic subjects with dual responses after allergen inhalation were included in this prospective, randomized, double-blind, 3-period crossover study. Outcomes included early and late asthmatic responses, changes in airway responsiveness, sputum eosinophilia measured before and after allergen challenge, numbers of airway submucosal myofibroblasts, and smooth muscle area measured before and after study treatment.

- **Results**: Allergen-induced sputum eosinophilia was significantly reduced by combination treatment to a greater extent than by budesonide alone. Allergen inhalation resulted in a significant increase in submucosal tissue myofibroblast numbers and produced a significant decrease in percentage smooth muscle area. Combination therapy, but not budesonide monotherapy, significantly attenuated these changes in myofibroblast numbers and smooth muscle area.

- **Conclusions**: The effects on allergen-induced changes in…

### Clarithromycin targets neutrophilic airway inflammation in refractory asthma [^115C9mw2]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with refractory asthma experience persistent symptoms despite maximal treatments with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators. The availability of add-on therapies is limited, necessitating effective options that specifically target noneosinophilic airway inflammation. Macrolide antibiotics, such as clarithromycin, display in vitro efficacy against IL-8 and neutrophils, which are key inflammatory mediators in noneosinophilic asthma.

The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of clarithromycin in patients with severe refractory asthma, particularly in a subgroup of patients with noneosinophilic asthma. Subjects with severe refractory asthma (n = 45) were randomized to receive clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) or a placebo for 8 weeks.

The primary outcome measured was sputum IL-8 concentration. Other inflammatory outcomes included sputum neutrophil numbers and concentrations of neutrophil elastase and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9. Clinical outcomes assessed included lung function, airway hyperresponsiveness to hypertonic saline, asthma control, quality of life, and symptoms. Clarithromycin therapy significantly reduced airway concentrations of IL-8 and neutrophil numbers while improving quality-of-life scores compared to placebo. Reductions in neutrophil elastase and MMP-9 concentrations were also observed, with the most marked reductions in inflammation seen in patients with refractory noneosinophilic asthma.

These findings suggest that clarithromycin therapy can modulate IL-8 levels and neutrophil accumulation effectively in cases of refractory asthma.

### Copd exacerbations: defining their cause and prevention [^112i7nCe]. Lancet (2007). Low credibility.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are episodes of worsening symptoms, leading to substantial morbidity and mortality. COPD exacerbations are associated with increased airway and systemic inflammation and physiological changes, especially the development of hyperinflation. They are triggered mainly by respiratory viruses and bacteria, which infect the lower airway and increase airway inflammation. Some patients are particularly susceptible to exacerbations and show worse health status and faster disease progression than those who have infrequent exacerbations.

Several pharmacological interventions are effective for reducing exacerbation frequency and severity in COPD, such as inhaled steroids, long-acting bronchodilators, and their combinations. Non-pharmacological therapies, such as pulmonary rehabilitation, self-management, and home ventilatory support, are becoming increasingly important but still need to be studied in controlled trials. The future of exacerbation prevention lies in assessing the optimum combinations of pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies that will result in improved health status, and reduced hospital admission and mortality associated with COPD.

### Are asthma and COPD a continuum of the same disease [^113GgHa1]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are common heterogeneous diseases with significant impacts on morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. In most cases, the main features and pathophysiology differ substantially between asthma and COPD, allowing differentiation of both entities and provision of appropriate treatment. The recognition of a subgroup of patients who clinically present with features of both conditions, known as asthma-COPD overlap syndrome, has reignited the debate over whether asthma and COPD are different manifestations of the same disease (the so-called Dutch hypothesis) or unique processes (the British hypothesis controversy).

There is enough heterogeneity in the clinical and mechanistic profiles of these three diseases, and subsets thereof, to suggest that a new approach relying on the concept of endotypes of obstructive airways disease may be more useful. This characterization has provided the basis for new research avenues that may eventually lead to the development of targeted drugs. This review focuses on the knowledge of asthma, COPD, and asthma-COPD overlap syndrome phenotypes with an emphasis on mechanisms of disease and how these may define endotypes, providing a more rational approach to research and clinical care.

### The role of inflammation and anti-inflammatory medication in asthma [^114VKufj]. Respiratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways involving a wide range of cells and mediators. First-line therapy of persistent asthma involves the use of inhaled corticosteroids to control the underlying inflammation of the airways. Inhaled beta2-agonists are also widely used in asthma therapy and are the most effective bronchodilators currently available. The short-acting beta2-agonists are now used on an as-needed basis for rapid relief of symptoms. In recent years, long-acting inhaled beta2-agonists have had an increasing role in the management of asthma, particularly in patients with moderate to severe asthma. This class of drug has a long duration of action and is recommended as add-on treatment to inhaled corticosteroids in the long-term control of asthma.

New therapies have been added to asthma therapy as our understanding of the pathogenesis of asthma has increased. The use of multiple therapies necessitates a clear understanding of the mode of action of the drugs and any potential interaction or overlap of effect. For many people, asthma is associated with complex therapy; thus, treatment developments that simplify asthma treatment are an important step forward in asthma management.

### Contribution of small airway inflammation to the development of COPD [^116sdgFb]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death worldwide in 2020. It is characterized by progressive and not fully irreversible airway obstruction in lung function. The natural history of COPD pathogenesis involves the destruction and loss of the terminal and transitional bronchioles because small airways narrow and disappear, inducing emphysema before a decline in lung function. The destruction of the small airways can be visualized on a thoracic micro-computed tomography scan when the emphysematous lesions become large enough. Even in the absence of emphysema, airway wall thickening with lumen narrowing is commonly observed as thickening of lung texture in the chest X-ray of chronic bronchitis. However, little attention has been paid to the pathophysiological changes occurring in the lungs of individuals at risk when they develop COPD.

COPD progresses over decades until the later development of symptoms or exacerbations. Understanding the early pathophysiological changes of COPD that encompass chronic bronchitis and emphysema is important to prevent its progression. Indeed, several large clinical trials targeting severe COPD have failed because the patients already had "irreversible disease" characterized by parenchymal destruction and remodeling of large numbers of central and peripheral airways. Inflammation develops initially in peripheral airways, then gradually to the complete airway, leading to the accelerated loss of lung function in the lungs of almost all smokers. It was reported that chronic inflammation…

### Airway inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Comparisons with asthma [^1119Ha8n]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive syndrome characterized by expiratory airflow limitation due to chronic inflammation of the airways and lung parenchyma. In the majority of cases, the airway inflammatory response in COPD is initiated by smoking. Chronic exposure to cigarette smoke causes damage to central airways, peripheral airways, and terminal airspaces, resulting in physiological and clinical abnormalities. Although COPD shares some clinical features with asthma, another common airway inflammatory disease, distinct differences exist in the phenotypic characteristics of airway inflammation between COPD and asthma.

In asthma, eosinophils are the most prominent inflammatory cells, while mast cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages also play important roles. In contrast, COPD's airway inflammatory infiltrate is primarily composed of neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes, with eosinophils playing a minor role except during exacerbations. These contrasting inflammatory phenotypes have significant implications for the clinical and physiological manifestations of these diseases, as well as their respective therapies.
