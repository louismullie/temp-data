## Question

which antiplatelet therapy is best for curing TB

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antiplatelet therapy is best for curing TB. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fundamental premise of TB cure and whether antiplatelets have any antimycobacterial effect. Then, I should define the clinical context where antiplatelets have been studied in TB, chiefly TB meningitis and stroke prevention. Next, I will review head-to-head and adjunctive evidence for aspirin versus clopidogrel in TBM. After that, I should examine pharmacology and drug–drug interactions, especially with rifampicin. Finally, I will synthesize clinical implications, dosing, safety, and provide a practical recommendation grounded in trial data and TB treatment standards [^116RR7N2] [^1152Hop1] [^114L6SHN].

> Let me first confirm the core premise so we don't jump to conclusions. Antiplatelet therapy does not cure tuberculosis; TB cure requires bactericidal/sterilizing antitubercular regimens, such as isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and companion agents tailored to resistance patterns, or specialized regimens for drug-resistant disease like bedaquiline–linezolid–pretomanid when indicated, none of which are replaced by aspirin or clopidogrel [^116RR7N2] [^115HUMzt] [^115KstpJ]. Wait, let me verify CNS-specific considerations: in TB meningitis, rifampicin CSF penetration can be inadequate at standard doses, and intensified rifampicin and adjuncts like linezolid have been explored to improve microbiologic and clinical outcomes, reinforcing that antimicrobial optimization, not antiplatelet therapy, is the cornerstone for cure in TBM [^115czHtc].

> Next, I should review where antiplatelets even fit. TB meningitis carries a high risk of ischemic infarction from inflammatory endarteritis and a prothrombotic milieu; antiplatelet therapy has been tested as an adjunct to standard ATT plus corticosteroids to reduce stroke and disability, not to eradicate mycobacteria or achieve microbiologic cure, and this distinction is essential to maintain throughout the analysis [^114L6SHN] [^117V3iy5]. I need to ensure the outcome of interest is framed properly: stroke prevention and functional outcomes as adjunctive endpoints, while ATT and steroids remain standard of care for TBM [^114L6SHN].

> I will now examine the most relevant comparative trial. The ACT TBM randomized open-label study allocated patients with TBM to aspirin 75 mg daily, clopidogrel 75 mg daily, or standard therapy, all on top of ATT plus dexamethasone; blinded outcome assessment found no statistically significant differences among groups in clinical stroke and/or imaging-defined cerebral infarction at one or three months, nor in mortality or major bleeding, indicating no superiority of aspirin over clopidogrel or vice versa for these endpoints in TBM at the tested doses and durations [^1152Hop1] [^111rZi4N] [^112PXTPf]. Let me double-check dosing and exposure duration so I do not misstate the regimen: both antiplatelets were given at 75 mg daily for 90 days as add-on to RHZE-based therapy plus dexamethasone, consistent with pragmatic cerebrovascular prevention dosing in non-TB populations [^113MTDME].

> Hold on, I should corroborate this with broader evidence. Prior RCTs and a meta-analysis of adjunctive aspirin in TBM suggest a signal for reduced new-onset stroke without a mortality benefit, though the overall credibility is limited by small sample sizes and heterogeneity; thus, while aspirin may modestly reduce incident stroke, the certainty is low, and these data do not establish aspirin as superior to clopidogrel in TBM, especially given the negative head-to-head signal in ACT TBM [^117Nx8us] [^114L6SHN]. Let me also note the older single-center trial that reported reduced stroke and mortality with aspirin 150 mg versus placebo; however, methodological limitations and loss to follow-up temper confidence, which I must keep in mind to avoid overinterpretation [^117TjcrR].

> Now, I need to check drug-specific factors, particularly pharmacology and interactions in the TB context. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and at low doses primarily reduces thromboxane-mediated platelet activation, while at higher doses it may exert anti-inflammatory effects that are sometimes hypothesized to be beneficial in TBM, though the RCT signal comes largely from low-dose regimens and remains inconsistent for hard outcomes like mortality [^114L6SHN]. I initially thought rifampicin's potent enzyme induction might blunt clopidogrel's effect by accelerating clearance, but wait, let me verify the actual pharmacokinetic data: rifampicin increases formation of clopidogrel's active metabolite via CYP induction, leading to greater P2Y12 blockade and platelet inhibition in healthy-volunteer studies, which introduces potential variability and possibly greater bleeding risk, even though ACT TBM did not show excess major bleeding on clopidogrel compared with aspirin or standard care in the short term [^112xZQtW] [^1152Hop1]. I should confirm safety again: in ACT TBM, major bleeding was rare and similar across arms, supporting that low-dose adjunctive antiplatelet therapy appears reasonably safe in this setting when patients are appropriately selected and monitored [^1152Hop1].

> Let me synthesize the clinical implications carefully. For curing TB, neither aspirin nor clopidogrel has any role, and antimicrobial therapy must be prioritized and optimized for drug-susceptible and drug-resistant disease, including attention to CNS penetration in TBM where appropriate [^116RR7N2] [^115czHtc]. For adjunctive stroke prevention in TBM, no agent is proven superior based on ACT TBM; aspirin has slightly more cumulative evidence from meta-analyses for reducing new-onset stroke, but with modest effect sizes and low certainty, whereas clopidogrel shows no clear advantage and carries a pharmacokinetic interaction with rifampicin that can amplify platelet inhibition unpredictably, so if an antiplatelet is chosen, aspirin is a reasonable default for simplicity, availability, and fewer interaction concerns, acknowledging that overall benefit remains unproven and should not detract from timely ATT plus steroids and supportive neurocritical care [^1152Hop1] [^114L6SHN].

> I should double-check practical details before making a bedside recommendation. If used, low-dose aspirin 75 mg daily for up to 90 days alongside standard ATT and dexamethasone mirrors the regimen studied, with vigilance for gastrointestinal bleeding and individualized reassessment if hemorrhagic complications, neurosurgical needs, or contraindications arise; this is an adjunct and remains optional given the uncertain impact on major outcomes beyond incident stroke signal in some studies [^113MTDME] [^117Nx8us]. I need to ensure we do not conflate this with microbiologic management: adherence to the full antitubercular regimen and, in TBM, consideration of rifampicin dosing strategies and CNS-penetrant agents when indicated, are the decisive drivers of cure and survival, not antiplatelet choice [^115czHtc] [^116RR7N2].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the final message. The premise that antiplatelets cure TB is incorrect; TB cure depends on appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and in TBM the best available randomized evidence shows no significant difference between aspirin and clopidogrel for preventing stroke or reducing mortality, with low absolute event rates and similar safety over 90 days, so neither agent is "best", and if an antiplatelet is selected as an adjunct, aspirin is preferred for simplicity and more consistent, albeit low-certainty, supportive data, while clinicians focus on optimizing ATT and corticosteroid therapy to drive outcomes [^1152Hop1] [^111rZi4N] [^114L6SHN] [^116RR7N2].

No antiplatelet therapy cures TB [^116RR7N2]; only standard **anti-tubercular regimens** [^115KstpJ] eradicate Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Antiplatelets like aspirin or clopidogrel **are not substitutes for anti-TB drugs** and do not improve microbiological cure or mortality. In TB meningitis, low-dose aspirin may reduce new strokes [^117Nx8us] but does not lower mortality, and clopidogrel offers no added benefit [^1152Hop1] [^112PXTPf]. Antiplatelets are not recommended for TB treatment and should only be used for standard cardiovascular indications.

---

## Mechanism of action of antiplatelet therapy

Antiplatelet agents inhibit platelet aggregation and thrombus formation, reducing ischemic events in cardiovascular disease [^116ctQwr]. They **do not have direct antimicrobial activity** against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of TB.

---

## Standard anti-tubercular therapy

The standard treatment for active TB [^116RR7N2] involves a combination of anti-tubercular drugs, including:

- **Isoniazid**
- **Rifampin**
- **Pyrazinamide**
- **Ethambutol**

These drugs are **administered in combination regimens** to effectively eradicate Mycobacterium tuberculosis and achieve microbiological cure [^115KstpJ].

---

## Role of antiplatelet therapy in tuberculosis

Antiplatelet therapy does **not have a direct role** in curing TB. However, it has been investigated as an adjunctive therapy in specific clinical scenarios, such as tuberculous meningitis (TBM), where it may potentially reduce the risk of ischemic stroke associated with TBM [^115czHtc].

---

## Clinical evidence on antiplatelet therapy in tuberculosis

Several clinical studies have **evaluated the efficacy and safety of antiplatelet therapy**, particularly aspirin, in TBM, including evidence that **aspirin in TBM** was associated with a significant reduction in new-onset stroke in a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112pc8e8] (hazard ratio 0.51, 95% CI 0.29–0.87, p = 0.01), although it did not significantly reduce mortality or the composite outcome of mortality and new-onset stroke, while **clopidogrel in TBM** was evaluated in the ACT TBM randomized trial [^112PXTPf], which found no significant difference in clinical stroke, radiological infarction, or mortality between clopidogrel, aspirin, and standard treatment groups [^1152Hop1].

---

## Safety considerations and drug interactions

Antiplatelet therapy carries a **risk of bleeding complications**, particularly in patients with thrombocytopenia or coagulopathies. Additionally, drug interactions between antiplatelet agents and anti-tubercular drugs, such as rifampin [^112xZQtW], may increase the risk of bleeding and other adverse effects [^111eihSm].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines **do not recommend antiplatelet therapy** as a primary or adjunctive treatment for TB. Antiplatelet therapy is only recommended for specific cardiovascular indications and not for the treatment of infectious diseases such as TB.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Antiplatelet therapy **does not cure TB** and is not recommended as a primary or adjunctive treatment for TB. The standard treatment for TB involves combination anti-tubercular drug regimens, which are effective in eradicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis [^116RR7N2]. Antiplatelet therapy may have a limited role in specific clinical scenarios, such as reducing the risk of ischemic stroke in TBM [^112pc8e8], but it does not significantly impact overall mortality or cure rates in TB patients.

### Efficacy and safety of aspirin as an adjunctive therapy in tubercular meningitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Nx8us]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Low credibility.

The meta-analysis from randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of aspirin as an adjunctive therapy in tubercular meningitis, in addition to anti-tubercular therapy, did not show a significant reduction in mortality (primary outcome) or the composite outcome of mortality and new-onset stroke. However, aspirin significantly reduced new-onset stroke compared to placebo in patients with tubercular meningitis, with a hazard ratio of 0.51 (95% CI 0.29–0.87, p = 0.01), and a Number Needed to Treat (NNT) of 10. Sensitivity analyses by Mai et al. and Misra et al. also showed similar results. Although a significant reduction was not seen in mortality or composite outcomes, a statistically significant reduction in new-onset stroke was observed with aspirin compared to placebo.

Since one of the main complications of tubercular meningitis is cerebral stroke (with a reported incidence of approximately 13–57%), which can lead to poor clinical outcomes, and considering that mortality is about three times higher in young tubercular meningitis patients with stroke compared to those without, even an NNT of 10 could have potential clinical significance in terms of reducing mortality and preventing new-onset stroke, thereby preventing disability.

Tubercular meningitis creates a hypercoagulable state with decreased protein S and increased factor VIII. Aspirin, due to its antiplatelet action, can inhibit platelet aggregation at low doses (75–150 mg). This property allows it to prevent ischemic cerebrovascular events, such as new-onset strokes. However, at high doses (> 150 mg), aspirin has an anti-inflammatory action.

### Trecator [^115KstpJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Trecator is primarily indicated for the treatment of active tuberculosis in patients with *M. tuberculosis* resistant to isoniazid or rifampin, or when there is intolerance on the part of the patient to other drugs. Its use alone in the treatment of tuberculosis results in the rapid development of resistance. It is essential, therefore, to administer a suitable companion drug or drugs, the choice being based on the results of susceptibility tests.

- **Indications and usage**: If the susceptibility tests indicate that the patient's organism is resistant to one of the first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs (i.e. isoniazid or rifampin) yet susceptible to ethionamide, ethionamide should be accompanied by at least one drug to which the *M. tuberculosis* isolate is known to be susceptible. If the tuberculosis is resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin, yet susceptible to ethionamide, ethionamide should be accompanied by at least two other drugs to which the *M. tuberculosis* isolate is known to be susceptible.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Trecator and other antibacterial drugs, Trecator should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Patient nonadherence to prescribed treatment can result in treatment failure.

### Pyrazinamide [^116RR7N2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Pyrazinamide is indicated for the initial treatment of active tuberculosis in adults and children when combined with other antituberculous agents. The recommendation of the CDC for drug-susceptible disease is to use a six-month regimen for the initial treatment of active tuberculosis, consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide given for two months, followed by isoniazid and rifampin for four months.

Patients with drug-resistant disease should be treated with regimens individualized to their situation. Pyrazinamide frequently will be an important component of such therapy. In patients with concomitant HIV infection, the physician should be aware of the CDC's recommendations. It is possible these patients may require a longer course of treatment.

Pyrazinamide is also indicated after treatment failure with other primary drugs in any form of active tuberculosis. It should only be used in conjunction with other effective antituberculous agents.

See the recommendations of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the American Thoracic Society for complete regimen and dosage recommendations.

### A randomised trial to assess the efficacy of add-on therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel to the standard medical therapy alone in patients with tubercular meningitis: ACT TBM [^112PXTPf]. The Lancet Regional Health. Southeast Asia (2025). Low credibility.

The benefit of antiplatelet therapy for stroke prevention or treatment among patients with tubercular meningitis (TBM) is uncertain. We hypothesized that add-on therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel to standard treatment would be safe and effective in reducing clinical stroke and/or cerebral infarction in patients with TBM.

This was a randomized, open-label, superiority trial with blinded outcome assessment. Patients with suspected TBM were randomized to receive either add-on oral aspirin 75 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg, along with ATT (anti-tubercular treatment), or only ATT. Clinical follow-up, MRI brain, and MR Angiogram were performed at baseline, one month, and three months from randomization. The primary outcome was a reduction in the occurrence of clinical stroke and/or imaging-based cerebral infarction at one and three months. The safety outcome was the occurrence of major or minor bleeding. Key secondary outcomes included mortality at one and three months and the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at three months.

A total of 237 patients with TBM were randomized (77 in the aspirin group, 77 in the clopidogrel group, and 83 in the standard treatment group). At one month, clinical stroke outcome was available for 66 (85.7%), 72 (93.5%), and 69 (83.1%) patients, and MRI brain results were available for 61 (79.2%), 65 (84.4%), and 62 (74.7%) patients, respectively. Clinical stroke was observed in one (1.5%) patient in the aspirin group, none (0.0%) in the clopidogrel group, and three (4.3%) patients in the standard group (across group comparison p = 0.2). Imaging-based cerebral infarction was observed in six…

### A phase 2A trial of the safety and tolerability of increased dose rifampicin and adjunctive linezolid, with or without aspirin, for human immunodeficiency virus-associated tuberculous meningitis: The LASER-TBM trial [^115czHtc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most severe form of tuberculosis (TB), with high mortality rates, up to 50%, among those coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Survivors often bear a significant burden of disability due to neurological sequelae, including stroke, epilepsy, inflammatory complications within the spinal cord, and cognitive impairment. Drug regimens used to treat TBM are largely based on those used for pulmonary TB. There is a critical need to design and evaluate new regimens that account for the drugs' differing ability to penetrate the central nervous system (CNS) while counteracting the dysregulated immune response occurring in TBM to improve outcomes for this disease.

Rifampicin, at standard adult doses, seldom achieves adequate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations. Therefore, it is likely that higher doses would increase CNS bactericidal activity. Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in TBM have evaluated high-dose rifampicin (13 mg/kg intravenous [IV] and 15 mg/kg oral) with conflicting results. A recent pharmacokinetic (PK) study suggested that doses higher than 15 mg/kg may improve outcomes by showing approximately 8-fold and approximately 6-fold higher CSF exposures with 35 mg/kg (oral) and 20 mg/kg (IV) doses, respectively, compared with the standard oral dose (10 mg/kg). Linezolid, now part of the World Health Organization recommended treatment for drug-resistant TB, is known to have broad tissue penetration, including into the CNS. Two observational studies of linezolid found favorable outcomes…

### A randomised trial to assess the efficacy of add on therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel to the standard medical therapy alone in patients with tubercular meningitis: ACT TBM [^114N6JEx]. The Lancet Regional Health. Southeast Asia (2025). Low credibility.

We conducted statistical analysis by calculating the sample size based on the estimated effect of aspirin in TBM. This was not directed at a sample size to observe differences between aspirin and clopidogrel. A previous study by Mai and colleagues showed an absolute risk difference of −16.2% (95% CI −33.1 to 2.0%) between the intervention with aspirin (81 mg, 6.7%) and the control arm (22.9%). We calculated the sample size for a two-sided test with an 80% power, resulting in 77 patients per group. Considering a loss to follow-up of 10%, 85 patients were planned for inclusion in each group. Thus, the total estimated sample size was 260 patients.

In a previous RCT on secondary ischemic stroke prevention, clopidogrel was slightly more effective in reducing composite vascular endpoints and hemorrhagic complications, although other studies have not confirmed this observation. Therefore, we included an equal number of cases in the clopidogrel arm to assess any differences between the two antiplatelet agents. Clinical and radiological data were collected using a predesigned proforma and analyzed using the R tool. Continuous variables were assessed using the Student's t-test, Mann Whitney U test, or Kruskal Wallis test as necessary. Qualitative variables were assessed using the Chi-square test. A two-sided p-value of < 0.05 was considered significant. Data were analyzed, and primary outcomes were presented using both intention-to-treat and per protocol approaches, following a complete cases analysis method. Intention-to-treat analysis included all randomized patients.

A report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines, and the American Stroke Association, American Association of Neuroscience Nurses, American Association of Neurological Surgeons, American College of Radiology, American Society of Neuroradiology, Congress of Neurological Surgeons, Society of Atherosclerosis Imaging and Prevention, Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, Society of Interventional Radiology, Society of NeuroInterventional Surgery, Society for Vascular Medicine, and Society for Vascular Surgery [^113kMk6W]. Circulation (2011). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for carotid artery stenosis, specifically with respect to antiplatelet therapy, the 2011 guidelines from AANN/AANS/ACC/ACR/AHA/ASA/ASNR/CNS/SAIP/SCAI/SIR/SNIS/SVM/SVS recommend initiating antiplatelet therapy with aspirin alone (75–325 mg daily), clopidogrel alone (75 mg daily), or the combination of aspirin plus extended-release dipyridamole (25 and 200 mg BID, respectively). This approach is preferred over the combination of aspirin with clopidogrel for patients with obstructive or nonobstructive extracranial carotid atherosclerosis and those who have sustained ischemic stroke or TIA.

### Clinical impact of rapid drug susceptibility testing to accompany fluoroquinolone-containing universal tuberculosis regimens: A Markov model [^114BxGe4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

To appropriately treat tuberculosis (TB) with regimens that combine novel and older drugs, evidence-based, context-specific strategies for drug-susceptibility testing (DST) will be required.

- **Methods**: We created a Markov state-transition model of 100,000 adults with TB receiving a novel fluoroquinolone (FQ)-containing regimen. We estimated clinical outcomes and resource utilization with no FQ-DST, universal FQ-DST, or FQ-DST only for patients with rifampin-resistant TB ("targeted FQ-DST"). We considered scenarios of stronger (South Africa) and weaker (Southeast Asia) correlation of fluoroquinolone resistance with rifampin resistance, with sensitivity analysis for other setting and regimen characteristics.

- **Results**: Relative to no FQ-DST, targeted FQ-DST increased cure of FQ-resistant TB by 7.5% (interquartile range [IQR], 6.7%-9.2%) in South Africa and 1.7% (IQR, 0.7%-2.5%) in Southeast Asia. However, rare FQ resistance among the more prevalent rifampin-susceptible TB accounted for 50% of FQ-resistant TB in South Africa and 83% in Southeast Asia. As a result, universal FQ-DST further increased cure of FQ-resistant TB by 3.4% (IQR, 2.3%-5.4%) in South Africa and 5.8% (IQR, 5.1%-6.3%) in Southeast Asia. With targeted FQ-DST, one additional patient was cured per 50 (IQR, 42–70) tests in South Africa and 44 (IQR, 37–51) in Southeast Asia. When expanding from targeted to universal FQ-DST, one additional cure required 3,500 (IQR, 2,300–5,500) tests in South Africa and 410 (IQR, 370–450) in Southeast Asia.

- **Conclusions**: FQ-DST improved patient outcomes and was particularly impactful in settings.

### Tuberculosis control interventions targeted to previously treated people in a high-incidence setting: a modelling study [^112SiPeb]. The Lancet Global Health (2018). High credibility.

We project that within 10 years in this setting, a combination of targeted active case finding and secondary isoniazid preventive therapy could avert more than a third of incident tuberculosis cases and tuberculosis deaths. Targeted active case finding alone could have a notable effect on tuberculosis prevalence and mortality, but is expected to have a smaller effect on incidence; our simulations suggest that a marked effect of targeted active case finding is achieved when it can be coupled with secondary isoniazid preventive therapy. Our projections show that much of the effect of targeted active case finding and secondary isoniazid preventive therapy accrues in the first few years after their implementation. The diminishing effect over time suggests a saturation effect, which might imply that such targeted interventions could be used within an adaptive control strategy.

Our study constitutes a first step towards better understanding the effect of interventions targeted to previously treated people in high-incidence settings. However, several limitations must be noted. We applied our model to a specific setting with a high tuberculosis incidence and where high rates of retuberculosis due to relapse and reinfection had been previously reported. We note that the effect of interventions targeted at previously treated people, which we project for this setting, might not be easily generalized to other high-incidence settings for several reasons. High rates of retuberculosis have been reported from several other high-incidence settings. However, the population-

### Efficacy and safety of aspirin as an adjunctive therapy in tubercular meningitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114L6SHN]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Low credibility.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) September 2018 report, tuberculosis (TB) is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide and a leading killer of patients who are HIV positive. TB is a global epidemic, with 10 million people diagnosed with tuberculosis and 1.5 million dying from the disease, as per the 2018 WHO report. Tubercular meningitis (TBM) is an important neuro-infectious condition that results in high mortality and morbidity with chronic neurological sequelae.

One significant factor contributing to the high morbidity and mortality in these patients is stroke. The mortality rate is three times higher in TBM patients with infarction compared to those without. This could be explained by the hypothesis that TBM represents a hypercoagulable state. A decrease in protein S and an increase in factor VIII lead to a prothrombotic state, which could be the reason for ischemic stroke and neuropathy in these patients. Stroke occurs in approximately 15% to 57% of TBM patients, especially in severe cases and those with an advanced stage. Among them, about 20% of patients experience focal neurological deficits.

The recommended therapy for these patients includes anti-tubercular therapy along with corticosteroids and supportive care. However, even with the best care, the prognosis for these patients remains poor due to neurological sequelae and high mortality.

### Efficacy and safety of aspirin as an adjunctive therapy in tubercular meningitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112pc8e8]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Low credibility.

Tubercular meningitis (TBM) is associated with high mortality and stroke, along with chronic neurological sequelae, even with the best care and antitubercular therapy. Studies have shown that aspirin as an adjunctive therapy might play some role in the management of TBM. This systematic review and meta-analysis was planned to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aspirin as an adjunctive therapy in TBM patients.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic search of randomized controlled trials in patients with tubercular meningitis published up to October 2019 in all major clinical journals. The study was registered with PROSPERO with registration number: CRD42019136689. Articles were tested for eligibility and assessed for quality and various biases. Data synthesis and analysis were performed using Review Manager 5.3. The primary endpoint for efficacy assessment was mortality at three months. The secondary endpoint was stroke or a composite outcome of stroke and mortality at three months. Adverse effects were also assessed as a secondary safety endpoint.

- **Findings**: Overall, three eligible randomized controlled trials with 365 participants were included, which provided quantitative data for this meta-analysis. The analysis of primary and secondary endpoints was conducted using a fixed-effect model. There was no significant reduction in mortality [hazard ratio 0.78 (95% CI 0.45–1.35, p = 0.37)] and the composite outcome of mortality and new-onset stroke [hazard ratio 0.86 (95% CI 0.60–1.24, p = 0.43)] in the aspirin group as compared to the placebo. However, aspirin, as compared to placebo, significantly reduced…

### A randomised trial to assess the efficacy of add on therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel to the standard medical therapy alone in patients with tubercular meningitis: ACT TBM [^1152Hop1]. The Lancet Regional Health, Southeast Asia (2025). High credibility.

The primary efficacy outcome, defined as clinical stroke and/or imaging-based cerebral infarction, was assessed at one month for 208 patients and at three months for 184 patients. Using an intention-to-treat approach with a complete cases analysis method, the primary outcome at one month occurred in 24 (11.5%) patients: six (9.1%) in the aspirin group, eight (11.1%) in the clopidogrel group, and ten (14.3%) in the standard treatment group. After three months, a new primary outcome (clinical stroke and/or radiological infarction) occurred in 11 (6.0%) patients: four (6.7%) in the aspirin group, four (6.1%) in the clopidogrel group, and three (5.1%) in the standard treatment group. No significant difference was found in the primary efficacy outcome at either one month or three months across the three groups and between groups. The results of the per protocol analysis for the primary efficacy outcome aligned with the intention-to-treat analysis. The sensitivity analysis, using best-case and worst-case scenarios, is detailed in Supplementary Table S4.

- **Safety outcome**: There was no difference in safety outcomes. Major bleeding was observed in only two patients: one (1.3%) in the clopidogrel group and one (1.3%) in the standard treatment group. Gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in three patients: one (1.3%) in the clopidogrel group and two (2.5%) in the standard treatment group.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of peripheral arterial and aortic diseases [^114yCNcp]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

For the medical management of carotid artery stenosis, particularly concerning antiplatelet therapy, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend the initiation of dual antiplatelet therapy with low-dose aspirin and clopidogrel (75 mg) for the first 21 days or longer. This should be followed by clopidogrel 75 mg or long-term aspirin to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis not undergoing carotid endarterectomy or stenting.

Regarding the medical management of peripheral artery disease — specifically in relation to antiplatelet therapy — the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend initiating antiplatelet therapy with aspirin alone (75–160 mg once daily) or clopidogrel alone (75 mg once daily) to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with symptomatic PAD.

### A randomised trial to assess the efficacy of add on therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel to the standard medical therapy alone in patients with tubercular meningitis: ACT TBM [^1115CwHz]. The Lancet Regional Health. Southeast Asia (2025). High credibility.

This study adds to the existing literature on the efficacy of antiplatelets in patients with TBM. It provides a large sample size with younger and sicker patients, a standardized ATT plus dexamethasone regimen, and a separate group for clopidogrel.

Limitations of the study include the inability to complete the predicted sample size and follow-up (clinical and MRI imaging) for all patients, likely due to mortality, the COVID-19 pandemic, being too disabled for a clinical follow-up, or being lost to follow-up. The lack of data on potentially sicker patients or those who may have died might account for the relatively lower mortality observed in our trial. The missing data could also lead to an incomplete estimation of cerebral infarction on imaging and stroke occurrence. The estimated sample size may have been too small to show any difference. Patients also had a variable history of disease onset, which could further reduce the potential benefit of the treatment.

The diagnosis of TBM can be delayed due to its chronic nature of evolution. Since a higher number of complications may occur in the earlier phase of the disease, events may be underestimated, although they could happen anytime during the course of the illness. Prevalent baseline clinical stroke or imaging-based infarction and low incidence of new stroke or infarction might have undermined the effects of antiplatelets in preventing vascular events. Sensitivity analysis showed variation in results at one and three months, likely due to the lack of known true events. This has questionable validity, and results cannot be generalized to all patients with TBM.

### Role of aspirin in tuberculous meningitis: A randomized open label placebo controlled trial [^117TjcrR]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2010). Low credibility.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of aspirin in preventing stroke and mortality in tuberculous meningitis (TBM), patients diagnosed with TBM based on clinical, MRI, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) criteria were randomized to receive either aspirin 150 mg daily or a placebo. All patients received a four-drug antitubercular treatment regimen, RHZE (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol), with or without corticosteroids. The primary endpoint was MRI-proven stroke at 3 months, while secondary endpoints included mortality and functional outcomes assessed by the Barthel Index score at 3 months. Adverse drug reactions were also analyzed.

A total of 118 TBM patients were randomized into aspirin and placebo groups. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, including severity of meningitis, MRI, and CSF changes, showed no significant differences between the two groups. Nineteen (16.1%) patients were lost to follow-up. Twenty-one (33.3%) patients developed stroke after randomization, with an insignificantly lower incidence in the aspirin group (24.2%) compared to the placebo group (43.3%; OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.12–1.39). Aspirin resulted in an absolute risk reduction of stroke by 19.1% and a significant reduction in mortality compared to placebo (21.7% vs. 43.4%, P = 0.02).

On binary logistic regression analysis, age (OR 1.09, CI 1.03–1.14, P = 0.001) was identified as the only independent risk factor for stroke, and aspirin was significantly associated with survival (OR 3.17, 95% CI 1.21–8.31). Aspirin was well-tolerated, and no patient required withdrawal due to side effects.

### Antifibrinolytic therapy to reduce haemoptysis from any cause [^1149MbzP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). High credibility.

Haemoptysis is a common pathology around the world, occurring with more frequency in low-income countries. It has different etiologies, many of which have infectious characteristics. Antifibrinolytic agents are commonly used to manage bleeding from different sources, but their usefulness in pulmonology is unclear.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of antifibrinolytic agents in reducing the volume and duration of haemoptysis in adult and paediatric patients.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) in The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and LILACS for publications that describe randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of antifibrinolytic therapy in patients presenting with haemoptysis. We also performed an independent search in MEDLINE for relevant trials not yet included in CENTRAL or DARE. Searches are up to date at the time of writing, to the 19th of September 2016. We conducted electronic and manual searches of relevant national and international journals. We reviewed the reference lists of included studies to locate relevant RCTs. An additional search was carried out to find unpublished RCTs.

- **Selection criteria**: We included RCTs designed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of antifibrinolytic agents in reducing haemoptysis in adult and paediatric patients of both genders presenting with haemoptysis of any etiology and severity. The intervention of interest was the administration of antifibrinolytic agents compared with placebo or no treatment.

### Platelets restrict the oxidative burst in phagocytes and facilitate primary progressive tuberculosis [^114oYWnu]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Platelets are generated in the capillaries of the lung, control hemostasis, and display immunological functions. Tuberculosis primarily affects the lung, and patients show platelet changes and hemoptysis. A role of platelets in the immunopathology of pulmonary tuberculosis requires careful assessment.

- **Objectives**: To identify the dynamics and interaction partners of platelets in the respiratory tissue and establish their impact on the outcome of pulmonary tuberculosis.

- **Methods**: Investigations were primarily performed in murine models of primary progressive pulmonary tuberculosis by analyzing mouse strains with variable susceptibility to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. This was done using platelet depletion and the delivery of antiplatelet drugs.

- **Measurements and main results**: Platelets were present at the site of infection and formed aggregates with different myeloid subsets during experimental tuberculosis. Such aggregates were also detected in patients with tuberculosis. Platelets were detrimental during the early phase of infection, and this effect was uncoupled from their canonical activation. Platelets left lung cell dynamics and patterns of antimycobacterial T-cell responses unchanged but hampered antimicrobial defense by restricting the production of reactive oxygen species in lung-residing myeloid cells. Platelets are detrimental in primary progressive pulmonary tuberculosis and orchestrate lung immunity by modulating innate immune responsiveness. These findings suggest that they may be amenable to new interventions for this deadly disease.

### Twelve months of isoniazid compared with four months of isoniazid and rifampin for persons with radiographic evidence of previous tuberculosis: An outcome and cost-effectiveness analysis [^117X15nh]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Isoniazid taken daily for 12 months and isoniazid and rifampin taken daily for 4 months are both recommended options for patients with radiographic evidence of previous tuberculosis and positive tuberculin skin tests who have not had prior treatment. We compared the completion rates, number of adverse effects, and cost-effectiveness of these two regimens.

Patients were treated at the San Francisco Tuberculosis Clinic from 1993 through 1996. A Markov model was developed to assess impact on life expectancy and costs. One thousand twenty-two patients, with a mean age of 52 years and over 90% foreign-born, were treated; 545 received isoniazid and 477 received isoniazid and rifampin. For isoniazid, 79.8% completed 12 months of therapy and 4.9% had adverse effects versus 83.6% completion and 6.1% adverse effects for isoniazid and rifampin (p > 0.05 for all between-group comparisons).

Both regimens increased life expectancy by 1.4–1.5 years. Compared with isoniazid, isoniazid and rifampin produced net incremental savings of $135 per patient treated. In patients with radiographic evidence of prior tuberculosis who have not been previously treated, isoniazid for 12 months and isoniazid and rifampin for 4 months have similar rates of completion and adverse effects, and both increase life expectancy compared with no treatment. Isoniazid and rifampin for 4 months is cost-saving compared with isoniazid alone. This advantage was maintained even when compared with 9 months of isoniazid, the new American Thoracic Society/Centers for Disease Control (ATS/CDC) recommendation for treatment with isoniazid alone.

Haemoptysis is a common pathology worldwide, occurring more frequently in low-income countries. It has various etiologies, many of which are infectious. Antifibrinolytic agents are commonly used to manage bleeding from different sources, but their usefulness in pulmonology remains unclear.

### Thrombocyte inhibition restores protective immunity to mycobacterial infection in zebrafish [^112dY3TF]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Infection-induced thrombocytosis is a clinically important complication of tuberculosis infection. Recent studies have highlighted the utility of aspirin as a host-directed therapy modulating the inflammatory response to infection, but have not investigated the possibility that the effect of aspirin is related to an antiplatelet mode of action.

- **Methods**: In this study, we utilize the zebrafish-Mycobacterium marinum model to show mycobacteria drive host hemostasis through the formation of granulomas. Treatment of infected zebrafish with aspirin markedly reduced mycobacterial burden. This effect is reproduced by treatment with platelet-specific glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, demonstrating a detrimental role for infection-induced thrombocyte activation.

- **Results**: We find that the reduction in mycobacterial burden is dependent on macrophages and granuloma formation, providing the first in vivo experimental evidence that infection-induced platelet activation compromises protective host immunity to mycobacterial infection.

- **Conclusions**: Our study illuminates platelet activation as an efficacious target of aspirin, a widely available and affordable host-directed therapy candidate for tuberculosis.

### Dedicated outreach service for hard to reach patients with tuberculosis in London: Observational study and economic evaluation [^113iSuvw]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

- **Principal findings, strengths, and limitations of study**: The Find and Treat service appears to be cost-effective, based on a threshold of £20,000-£30,000/QALY gained, used by NICE. Although analyses of each Find and Treat component should be interpreted with caution because of overlapping costs between the two services, they both seem to be cost-effective separately. We obtained similar results when we made assumptions that were more unfavorable to the Find and Treat service. In the most unfavorable case, where data were interpreted unfavorably in five instances to create a very highly unlikely scenario, the mobile screening unit had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of about £26,000. NICE would often still consider this ratio to be acceptable, particularly since during model parameterization, whenever data were not available, we made conservative assumptions to ensure that the benefit of Find and Treat was not overestimated.

One limitation of our analysis is the absence of a trial randomizing tuberculosis cases to be either managed or not managed by the Find and Treat service. The absence of randomization meant that we could not be sure of the outcomes of Find and Treat managed cases if the service did not exist. Consequently, we based our model of such outcomes on controls with active tuberculosis in London's enhanced tuberculosis surveillance system who presented for care. Although we chose controls to have at least one risk factor to represent the potential target population for the Find and Treat service, the service also manages extremely high-risk groups not fully represented by these controls.

### 2011 ASA/ACCF/AHA/AANN/AANS/ACR/ASNR/CNS/SAIP/SCAI/SIR/SNIS/SVM/SVS guideline on the management of patients with extracranial carotid and vertebral artery disease: Executive summary. A report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines, and the American Stroke Association, American Association of Neuroscience Nurses, American Association of Neurological Surgeons, American College of Radiology, American Society of Neuroradiology, Congress of Neurological Surgeons, Society of Atherosclerosis Imaging and Prevention, Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, Society of Interventional Radiology, Society of NeuroInterventional Surgery, Society for Vascular Medicine, and Society for Vascular Surgery [^113t51Uq].

Regarding medical management for vertebral artery stenosis, particularly concerning antiplatelet therapy, the 2011 guidelines from AANN/AANS/ACC/ACR/AHA/ASA/ASNR/CNS/SAIP/SCAI/SIR/SNIS/SVM/SVS recommend initiating antiplatelet agents rather than oral anticoagulants (OACs) in patients with atherosclerosis of the extracranial vertebral arteries, irrespective of the presence or absence of ischemic symptoms.

### Post-tuberculosis sequelae and the burden of "long TB": Continuing TB care after treatment completion [^114WT1BF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

In the nearly 80 years since the publication of the landmark trial "Streptomycin Treatment of Pulmonary Tuberculosis" (TB) — the first ever randomized clinical trial — TB research and care have been understandably focused on pathogen eradication and microbiologic cure. An inherent feature of this focus on microbiologic outcomes, which has been dutifully performed by TB programs built around administering directly observed therapy, is that TB care ends at the completion of a certain number of doses of antitubercular medications. Consequently, TB cure rates and mortality rates from TB have steadily improved in recent decades, representing a major advance for global public health.

This focus on microbiologic cure has, however, led to a myopic view of TB as a disease defined primarily by detection of the pathogen. Although there is an increasing recognition that the binary categorization of latent TB infection versus active TB disease is an oversimplification, the relatively recent conceptualization of TB as having a more nuanced microbiologic and clinical spectrum has yet to incorporate a post-treatment state into this continuum. Thus, the approach to TB is analogous to a situation in which those suffering cerebrovascular accidents have their acute pathology addressed only to be discharged without follow-up care or regard for their long-term neurologic debility.

The fact that TB is an infectious disease, with treatment centered on the pathogen, has seemingly led to a sense of fatalism regarding its sequelae. This fatalism is evident in the care of individuals with persistent lung damage after treatment.

### Tuberculosis control interventions targeted to previously treated people in a high-incidence setting: a modelling study [^117SgAcm]. The Lancet Global Health (2018). Low credibility.

Although our projections are consistent with the epidemiology of tuberculosis in other high-incidence communities in South Africa, we expect interventions among previously treated people to be less effective in settings with lower tuberculosis incidence, where a smaller proportion of the tuberculosis burden is attributable to former tuberculosis patients. For example, previously treated people accounted for 4.1% of the adult population and for 13% of prevalent tuberculosis cases in Lusaka, Zambia, and for 1.5% and 15%, respectively, in Nigeria — two settings with lower tuberculosis incidence than our study setting. Nonetheless, given that new approaches for tuberculosis control are most needed in areas where tuberculosis incidence has been persistently high, our results suggest that efforts to both prevent and rapidly detect and treat the disease will produce important health benefits. In our scenario analysis, for which we lowered the force of infection by 50%, we noted that targeted active case finding in combination with secondary isoniazid preventive therapy reduced the expected number of incident tuberculosis cases and deaths to a lesser extent but still averted a third of incident cases.

Differences in the prevalence of HIV in a population might influence the effect of interventions targeted to previously treated people in several ways. Communities with higher HIV prevalence might experience more re-tuberculosis given the elevated risk of re-infection with tuberculosis among HIV-infected individuals, and thus benefit more from similar interventions.

### Antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs in interventional radiology [^111eihSm]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

In treating peripheral arterial disease, a profound knowledge of antiplatelet and anticoagulative drug therapy is helpful to assure a positive clinical outcome and to anticipate and avoid complications. Side effects and drug interactions may have fatal consequences for the patient, so interventionalists should be aware of these risks and able to control them. Aspirin remains the first-line agent for antiplatelet monotherapy, with clopidogrel added where dual antiplatelet therapy is required. In cases of suspected antiplatelet drug resistance, the dose of clopidogrel may be doubled; prasugrel or ticagrelor may be used alternatively. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (abciximab or eptifibatide) may help in cases of hypercoagulability or acute embolic complications. Desmopressin, tranexamic acid, or platelet infusions may be used to decrease antiplatelet drug effects in cases of bleeding.

Intraprocedurally, anticoagulant therapy treatment with unfractionated heparin (UFH) still is the means of choice, although low molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) are suitable, particularly for post-interventional treatment. Adaptation of the LMWH dose is often required in renal insufficiency, which is frequently found in elderly patients. Protamine sulphate is an effective antagonist for UFH; however, this effect is less for LMWH. Newer antithrombotic drugs, such as direct thrombin inhibitors or factor X inhibitors, have limited importance in periprocedural treatment, with the exception of treating patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).

### A randomised trial to assess the efficacy of add on therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel to the standard medical therapy alone in patients with tubercular meningitis: ACT TBM [^1139S5dJ]. The Lancet Regional Health. Southeast Asia (2025). High credibility.

- **Results**:

- **Participants**: A total of 237 TBM patients were enrolled in the trial and randomized into aspirin, clopidogrel, and standard treatment groups. At one month, the clinical stroke outcome was available for 66 (85.7%) patients in the aspirin group, 72 (93.5%) patients in the clopidogrel group, and 69 (83.1%) patients in the standard treatment group; MRI brain scans were available for 61 (79.2%), 65 (84.4%), and 62 (74.7%) patients, respectively. At three months, clinical stroke outcomes for the aspirin, clopidogrel, and standard groups were available for 60 (77.9%), 63 (81.8%), and 59 (71.1%) patients, respectively; MRI brain scans were available for 57 (74.0%), 60 (77.9%), and 55 (66.3%) patients, respectively.

The reasons for patient dropout at one and three months were death, withdrawal, or loss to follow-up for primary outcome assessment. The trial was planned for three years and was extended by an additional six months. Patients and/or their families were counseled for compliance and asked to maintain empty strips of the intervention medication during follow-up. Apart from patients who either died, withdrew from the trial, or were lost to follow-up for primary outcome assessment, no significant compliance issues were observed.

### The role of aspirin in childhood tuberculous meningitis [^114xwaq7]. Journal of Child Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Arterial stroke is the main cause of poor outcomes in childhood tuberculous meningitis. Aspirin has an antithrombotic action at low dose and anti-ischemic and anti-inflammatory properties, which are dose-related. The aim of the study was to explore the possible benefits of aspirin in children with tuberculous meningitis. A total of 146 consecutive children with a diagnosis of probable tuberculous meningitis were studied.

Patients were randomized into three groups: (1) placebo group, (2) low-dose aspirin group, and (3) high-dose aspirin group. Twenty-nine additional patients who received aspirin before admission were excluded from the randomized study, but they continued on low-dose aspirin. Aspirin, irrespective of dose, did not show any significant benefit regarding morbidity (hemiparesis and developmental outcome) and mortality. Aspirin was well tolerated, but one death was probably related to aspirin. The outcome of the high-dose aspirin group compared favorably with the other treatment groups despite younger age and more severe neurological involvement at baseline, which needs further investigation.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of coronary artery disease, particularly in relation to antiplatelet therapy, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA 2023 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy for at least 12 months. This approach aims to reduce bleeding risk in selected patients with chronic coronary disease who have been treated with PCI and a drug-eluting stent, following a completed 1–3-month course of dual antiplatelet therapy.

### Effect of antiplatelet treatments on patients with COVID-19 infection: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111nD2kb]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Despite the rationale that early antiplatelet intervention would lower the risk of major organ dysfunction, the effectiveness of this approach remains controversial. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effect of antiplatelet treatments on patients with COVID-19 infection. An electronic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, MEDLINE, Wanfang, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). Meta-analysis and statistical analyses were completed using the RevMan 5.3 and Stata 12.0 software.

A total of 9 articles representing data from 5,970 participants were included in this study. The meta-analysis showed that antiplatelet agents were not associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease (OR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.64 to 1.50, P = 0.94; I² = 65%), while an adjusted analysis indicated that antiplatelet agents were not associated with an increased risk of mortality (OR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.40 to 1.06, P = 0.498; I² = 0%).

The results of this study reveal that while there is no significant benefit on mortality demonstrated with the use of antiplatelet agents, the upper bound of the confidence interval suggests that there is unlikely to be a compelling risk of harm associated with this practice. The benefit and risk of the use of antiplatelet agents should be fully considered, especially in the presence of thrombocytopenia status in patients with COVID-19.

### Consistent reduction in periprocedural myocardial infarction with cangrelor as assessed by multiple definitions: Findings from CHAMPION PHOENIX (Cangrelor versus standard therapy to achieve optimal management of platelet inhibition) [^115ARjyr]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Because the majority of ischemic events that occurred during the first 48 hours of CHAMPION PHOENIX were type 4a MIs related to PCI, these data highlight the need for adequate and effective antithrombotic therapies. Guidelines recommend that patients undergoing PCI be treated with oral antiplatelet therapies before or immediately after the procedure. The oral P2Y12 inhibitors currently used in practice have a delayed onset of action and do not result in antiplatelet effects for approximately 60 to 120 minutes.

The delay in the onset of antiplatelet effect is particularly problematic for patients such as those treated with ad hoc PCI after elective coronary angiography or in patients undergoing PCI for acute coronary syndrome. In these cases, little antiplatelet effect may be present during the actual PCI. Furthermore, some medications, such as those used during moderate sedation, may delay the onset of antiplatelet effects.

Intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors are available and can be used in patients undergoing PCI who are not pretreated with an oral P2Y12 inhibitor. However, prior studies showed that the majority of benefit from glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors occurred in patients with elevated cardiac biomarkers. The EARLY-ACS trial and ACUITY trial demonstrated that the routine use of these agents in these populations increased the risk of bleeding without significant improvements in clinical outcomes. As a result, the use of these agents is limited.

### Drug regimens identified and optimized by output-driven platform markedly reduce tuberculosis treatment time [^112CL8zr]. Nature Communications (2017). High credibility.

Both regimens comprised previously approved drugs, and the first regimen (PRS Regimen I) comprised exclusively generic drugs. Both regimens were markedly more efficacious than the Standard Regimen in reducing the lung burden of M. tuberculosis. For example, at four weeks after the start of treatment, mice treated with PRS Regimen I had 1.3 logs fewer CFU in their lungs than mice treated with the Standard Regimen, while mice treated with PRS Regimen IIC had 4.0 logs fewer lung CFU counts than Standard Regimen-treated mice.

Both regimens were also markedly more efficacious than the Standard Regimen in achieving relapse-free cure. Whereas the Standard Regimen required 12 weeks to achieve 80% relapse-free cure and 16 weeks to achieve 100% relapse-free cure in our in vivo model, PRS Regimen I achieved these milestones in 8 and 12 weeks, respectively, and PRS Regimen IIC in 3 and 4 weeks, respectively.

Thus, compared with the Standard Regimen, PRS Regimens I and IIC reduced the duration of treatment required to achieve 80% relapse-free cure by 33 and 75%, respectively, and 100% relapse-free cure by 25% and 75%, respectively. In addition, as discussed below, PRS Regimen II achieves lung culture negativity and relapse-free cure in the mouse model faster than other regimens shown to accelerate treatment. If our results in mice extrapolate to humans, PRS Regimen IIC would be expected to reduce the duration of treatment of TB from 6–8 months, as is currently the case for the Standard Regimen, to 1½–2 months.

Moreover, as neither PRS Regimen I nor PRS Regimen II includes INH, RIF, or fluorquinolones, these regimens present alternative strategies for tuberculosis treatment.

### Potentiation of clopidogrel active metabolite formation by rifampicin leads to greater P2Y12 receptor blockade and inhibition of platelet aggregation after clopidogrel [^112xZQtW]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2010). Low credibility.

The thienopyridine P2Y(12) receptor antagonist clopidogrel reduces the risk of arterial thrombosis, and individual pharmacodynamic responses to clopidogrel are believed to reflect the levels of active metabolite (AM) generated. Rifampicin increases the inhibitory effect of clopidogrel on platelet aggregation (PA). This study was conducted to analyze the response to clopidogrel before and during administration of rifampicin, focusing on the relationship between individual AM levels and P2Y(12) blockade.

- **Methods**: Healthy volunteers received a 600-mg loading dose of clopidogrel, followed by 75 mg daily for 7 days. After a washout period and treatment with rifampicin [300 mg twice a day (b.i.d.)], the same regimen of clopidogrel was administered. Clopidogrel AM levels were measured over 4 hours after the loading dose, and the unblocked P2Y(12) receptor number was assessed using a (33) P-2MeSADP binding assay. PA was measured by optical aggregometry with ADP and TRAP.

- **Results**: Rifampicin enhanced clopidogrel AM production [area-under-the-curve (AUC): clopidogrel 89 ± 22 ng h mL(-1), clopidogrel+rifampicin 335 ± 86 ng h mL(-1), P < 0.0001], increased P2Y(12) blockade (unblocked receptors: clopidogrel 48 ± 24, clopidogrel+rifampicin 4 ± 2, P < 0.0001), and reduced PA (5 μmol L(-1) ADP: clopidogrel 20 ± 4, clopidogrel+rifampicin 5 ± 2, P < 0.01). Increasing numbers of unblocked receptors were required for an aggregation response with a decreasing concentration of ADP. PA induced by ADP 2 μmol L(-1) was particularly sensitive to low levels of receptor blockade.

### A randomised trial to assess the efficacy of add on therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel to the standard medical therapy alone in patients with tubercular meningitis: ACT TBM [^111rZi4N]. The Lancet Regional Health. Southeast Asia (2025). High credibility.

Mortality data was available for 226 patients at one month and for 198 patients at three months. There was no significant difference in mortality at one and three months follow-up across the three groups and between groups. Using an intention-to-treat approach following a complete cases analysis method, at one month, a total of 18 patients (8.0%) died: seven (9.6%) in the aspirin group, four (5.3%) in the clopidogrel group, and seven (9.0%) in the standard treatment group. At three months, 13 new deaths (6.6%) were recorded: four (6.2%) in the aspirin group, four (5.9%) in the clopidogrel group, and five (7.6%) in the standard treatment group.

A large number of patients remained dependent (mRS ≥ 2) in all treatment groups at three months [34 (48.0%) in aspirin, 30 (42.2%) in clopidogrel, and 34 (47.2%) in standard treatment groups] and nine months [20 (30.8%) in aspirin, 21 (32.3%) in clopidogrel, and 21 (31.8%) in standard treatment groups]. There was no significant difference in functional outcome at both one month and three months across the three groups and between groups. Moreover, no significant difference was observed between aspirin and clopidogrel groups in the occurrence of cerebral infarction or stroke, mortality, and functional outcome. Secondary outcomes using per protocol analysis did not differ from intention-to-treat analysis, except for functional outcome at three months in the adjusted model of relative risk.

### New measurable indicator for tuberculosis case detection [^113LcfDD]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Reversing global tuberculosis (TB) incidence by 2015 is included in the Millennium Development Goals. Progress towards this goal is measured by prevalence and death rates (indicator 23) and the proportion of cases detected and cured under a directly observed treatment strategy (DOTS) (indicator 24). For indicator 24, the World Health Organization (WHO) has formulated the following goals: a case detection rate of 70% and a cure rate of 85%. If both targets are achieved, the effect on TB transmission will be considerable.

WHO defines the cure rate as the proportion of new cases of smear-positive TB that were cured through treatment; this rate is routinely measured by treatment registers. The case detection rate is the proportion of incident smear-positive TB cases detected through a TB program. It is measured as the notification rate of new cases of smear-positive TB divided by the estimated incidence rate.

Incidence is estimated by using various sources of information. An important element in these estimates is the proposed relationship between the incidence of TB and the annual risk for TB infection. Styblo estimated that, in the absence of control, a 1% (i.e. 1,000/100,000) annual risk for infection would correspond with an incidence of new cases of smear-positive TB of approximately 50 per 100,000. In other words, in the absence of control measures, 50 cases would generate 1,000 infections; i.e. the average patient with a new case of smear-positive TB would generate approximately 20 infections over time.

### Antiplatelet drugs [^116ctQwr]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

Platelets play a major role in thromboembolic diseases, making antiplatelet therapy crucial for treatment and prophylaxis. Upon vascular injury, platelets rapidly adhere to the exposed subendothelial matrix, leading to their activation. This activation results in the recruitment of additional platelets from circulation to form a stable arterial platelet plug. While controlled plug formation is desired to prevent excessive blood loss and promote wound healing, pathological conditions can result in occlusive thrombi, leading to severe clinical complications such as myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke.

Many antiplatelet approaches have been investigated, targeting various stages of thrombus formation. This review examines antiplatelet agents that interfere with the three principal phases of thrombus formation: platelet adhesion, amplification of platelet activation, and platelet aggregation. For each stage, novel experimental targets and clinically established antiplatelet strategies are reviewed. Limitations and potential benefits are discussed for each target.

### Newly formed reticulated platelets undermine pharmacokinetically short-lived antiplatelet therapies [^113d5kK8]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2017). Low credibility.

Aspirin, together with thienopyridine P2Y12 inhibitors, commonly clopidogrel, is a cornerstone of antiplatelet therapy. However, many patients receiving this therapy display high on-treatment platelet reactivity, which is a major therapeutic hurdle to the prevention of rethrombotic events. The emergence of uninhibited platelets after thrombopoiesis has been proposed as a contributing factor to high on-treatment platelet reactivity. Here, we investigate the influences of platelet turnover on platelet aggregation in the face of different dual-antiplatelet therapy strategies.

- **Approach and results**: Traditional light transmission aggregometry, cytometry, advanced flow cytometric imaging, and confocal microscopy were used to follow the interactions of populations of platelets from healthy volunteers and patients with stable cardiovascular disease. Newly formed reticulated platelets disproportionately contributed to, and clustered at, the core of forming aggregates. This phenomenon was observed particularly in samples from patients treated with aspirin plus a thienopyridine but was absent in samples taken from patients treated with aspirin plus ticagrelor.

- **Conclusions**: Reticulated platelets are more reactive than older platelets and act as seeds for the formation of platelet aggregates even in the presence of antiplatelet therapy. This is coherent with the emergence of an uninhibited subpopulation of reticulated platelets during treatment with aspirin plus thienopyridine, explained by the short pharmacokinetic half-lives of these drugs.

### Long-term treatment outcomes in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis [^111BgupY]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to describe long-term treatment outcomes in patients with multidrug-resistant/rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/RR-TB) and validate established outcome definitions for MDR/RR-TB treatment.

Among patients with MDR/RR-TB admitted to a German MDR/RR-TB referral center from September 1, 2002, to February 29, 2020, we compared long-term treatment outcomes derived from individual patient follow-up with treatment outcomes defined by WHO-2013, WHO-2021, and the Tuberculosis Network European Trials Group-2016.

In a total of 163 patients (mean age, 35 years; standard deviation, 13 years; 14 of 163 [8.6%] living with HIV; 109 of 163 [66.9%] men, 149 of 163 [91.4%] migrating to Germany within 5 years), the treatment of culture-confirmed MDR/RR-TB was initiated. Additional drug resistance to a fluoroquinolone or a second-line injectable agent was present in 15 of the 163 (9.2%) Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains; resistance against both drug classes was present in 29 of the 163 (17.8%) strains. The median duration of MDR/RR-TB treatment was 20 months (interquartile range, 19.3–21.6 months), with a median of five active drugs included. The median follow-up time was 4 years (47.7 months; interquartile range, 21.7–65.8 months). Among the 163 patients, cure was achieved in 25 (15.3%), 82 (50.3%), and 95 (58.3%) patients according to the outcome definitions of WHO-2013, WHO-2021, and the Tuberculosis Network European Trials Group-2016, respectively. The lost to follow-up rate was 17 of 163 (10.4%). Death was more likely in patients living with HIV (hazard ratio, 4.

### Aminoglycosides and capreomycin in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: Individual patient data meta-analysis of 12 030 patients from 25 countries, 2009–2016 [^115oMu9S]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

As new drugs are developed for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), the role of currently used drugs must be reevaluated.

- **Methods**: We combined individual-level data on patients with pulmonary MDR-TB published during 2009–2016 from 25 countries. We compared patients receiving each of the injectable drugs and those receiving no injectable drugs. Analyses were based on patients whose isolates were susceptible to the drug they received. Using random-effects logistic regression with propensity score matching, we estimated the effect of each agent in terms of standardized treatment outcomes.

- **Results**: More patients received kanamycin (n = 4330) and capreomycin (n = 2401) than amikacin (n = 2275) or streptomycin (n = 1554), opposite to their apparent effectiveness. Compared with kanamycin, amikacin was associated with 6 more cures per 100 patients (95% confidence interval, 4–8), while streptomycin was associated with 7 (95% CI, 5–8) more cures and 5 (95% CI, 4–7) fewer deaths per 100 patients. Compared with capreomycin, amikacin was associated with 9 (95% CI, 6–11) more cures and 5 (95% CI, 2–8) fewer deaths per 100 patients, while streptomycin was associated with 10 (95% CI, 8–13) more cures and 10 (95% CI, 7–12) fewer deaths per 100 patients treated. In contrast to amikacin and streptomycin, patients treated with kanamycin or capreomycin did not fare better than patients treated with no injectable drugs.

- **Conclusions**: When aminoglycosides are used to treat MDR-TB and drug susceptibility test results support their use, streptomycin and amikacin, not kanamycin, are more effective.

### Current antiplatelet therapies: benefits and limitations [^1148FsCo]. American Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet therapy is the criterion standard for the treatment of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention and those with acute coronary syndromes. Clopidogrel, in combination with aspirin, is the standard of care for reducing cardiovascular events in these patients. However, patients receiving currently available antiplatelet therapy may still develop atherothrombotic events. Despite the clinical benefits achieved with clopidogrel, significant clinical limitations are associated with its use. This article summarizes the understanding of the benefits and limitations of the commonly used antiplatelet therapies.

### Clinical management of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in 16 European countries [^117UitY3]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a major burden to public health in Europe. Reported treatment success rates are around 50% or less, and cure rates are even lower.

To document management and treatment outcomes in patients with MDR-TB in Europe, a prospective cohort study was conducted. Management and treatment outcomes were analyzed, stratified by the incidence of patients with MDR-TB across Europe. Outcomes were compared using World Health Organization and alternative simplified definitions by the Tuberculosis Network European Trialsgroup (TBNET).

A total of 380 patients with MDR-TB were recruited and followed between 2010 and 2014 in 16 European countries. Patients in high-incidence countries, compared with those in low-incidence countries, were treated more frequently with standardized regimens (83.2% vs. 9.9%), experienced delayed treatment initiation (median, 111 vs. 28 days), developed more additional drug resistance (23% vs. 5.8%), and had increased mortality (9.4% vs. 1.9%). Notably, only 20.1% of patients using pyrazinamide had proven susceptibility to the drug.

According to World Health Organization outcome definitions, the frequency of cure (38.7% vs. 9.7%) was higher in high-incidence countries. Simplified outcome definitions, which include one year of follow-up after treatment, showed similar frequencies of relapse-free cure in low- (58.3%), intermediate- (55.8%), and high-incidence (57.1%) countries, but the highest frequency of failure was noted in high-incidence countries (24.1% vs. 14.6%).

### Potential of pan-tuberculosis treatment to drive emergence of novel resistance [^114hNQ8z]. Emerging infectious diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Another potential concern about using novel drugs, such as bedaquiline in all patients, is that the broader population scale of acquired resistance might leave many patients without effective treatment options. We did not identify any clinical pathways by which this scenario was likely to occur. In our model, RR-TB was treated similarly in both scenarios (dependent on DST coverage), and showed high enough rates of durable cure to cause preexisting RR-TB to decrease over time in the pan-TB scenario. Meanwhile, although we modeled retreatment with a rifamycin-based regimen for a substantial proportion of RS-TB cases that were not cured with the initial pan-TB regimen treatment (some of which had resistance to B, X, or both), we projected similar levels of complex resistance with this approach as with continued use of a rifamycin-based first-line regimen followed by the use of novel drugs after selection of rifampin resistance. This finding suggests that, even as resistance accumulated to components of a pan-TB regimen, most patients for whom the pan-TB regimen was ineffective would (once identified by DST) have existing rifamycin-based regimens as back-ups.

In reality, many of the characteristics of future pan-TB regimens are unknown. Although the pan-TB target regimen profile seeks to improve regimen duration, tolerability, and pharmacologic forgiveness, the effects of those improvements on adherence and ultimately effectiveness may be unpredictable and setting-dependent. Our model suggests that if the difference in effectiveness is small between a pan-TB regimen and the rifamycin-based approach, the eventual impact on resistance and treatment options might not differ significantly.

- **Study flow chart**: Baseline characteristics are outlined in Table 1, Supplementary Tables S1–S3. The mean age of the patients was 29.93 (± 14.07) years with a female preponderance (59%). At admission, altered sensorium was present in 153 (65%) patients and seizure had occurred in 88 (37%) patients. TBM diagnosis was definite in 122 (51%), highly probable in 96 (41%), and probable in 19 (8%). CSF GeneXpert was positive in 111 (47%) among 178 tested patients. CSF AFB was detected in only one among the 222 tested and mycobacterium grew in only 12 (5.1%) among 99 cultures available. Nearly half, 117 (49%) of the patients, had advanced BMC grade 3 severity of TBM at admission and the majority (61%) were moderate to severely disabled on the modified Rankin scale (mRS 4 and 5). Other comorbidities were uncommon. The presence of extraneural tuberculosis and previous ATT exposure were evenly distributed among the groups.

### A randomised trial to assess the efficacy of add on therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel to the standard medical therapy alone in patients with tubercular meningitis: ACT TBM [^113MTDME]. The Lancet Regional Health. Southeast Asia (2025). High credibility.

The aspirin group received standard weight-based ATT, which included rifampicin (∼10 mg/kg, based on weight), isoniazid (∼5 mg/kg, based on weight), pyrazinamide (∼15–30 mg/kg, based on weight), ethambutol (∼15 mg/kg, based on weight), or streptomycin (0.75–1 gm/day). They were also given steroids and an additional treatment with aspirin 75 mg daily. The clopidogrel group received standard weight-based ATT, steroids, and additional treatment with clopidogrel 75 mg daily. The standard treatment group received only ATT and steroids.

The general protocol included a 4-drug ATT (RHZE/S) for two months, followed by a 3-drug ATT (RHZ) typically for the next 10 months, as TBM patients are usually treated for durations varying from 12 to 18 months. Aspirin and clopidogrel were administered for the initial 90 days in groups 1 and 2, respectively. A pragmatic dose of 75 mg was used, a common practice in routine clinical settings for stroke prevention and treatment. Dexamethasone was the preferred steroid, administered for a minimum duration of eight weeks. It was given intravenously (up to 0.4 mg/kg/day in 3–4 divided doses) during the hospital stay, with oral maintenance thereafter. Extended steroid use was permitted based on the treating physicians' discretion, depending on clinical or radiological response to treatment.

- **Outcomes**: The primary efficacy outcome was the occurrence of clinical stroke and/or cerebral infarction on MRI brain at one and three months of follow-up. The primary safety outcomes included any major or minor bleeding, as per the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis definition, and any haematemesis or intracerebral haemorrhage (parenchymal, subarachnoid, or subdural).

### A randomised trial to assess the efficacy of add on therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel to the standard medical therapy alone in patients with tubercular meningitis: ACT TBM [^111zjGFX]. The Lancet Regional Health. Southeast Asia (2025). Low credibility.

At baseline, clinical stroke was noted in 40 patients (17%) out of 235 available records. Using an intention-to-treat approach following a complete cases analysis method, at one month, clinical stroke occurred in four patients (1.9%): one (1.5%) in the aspirin group, none in the clopidogrel group, and three (4.3%) in the standard treatment group. At three months, a new clinical stroke had occurred in five more patients (2.7%): two (3.3%) in the aspirin group, one (1.6%) in the clopidogrel group, and two (3.4%) in the standard treatment group. There was no significant difference in the occurrence of clinical stroke at both one month and three months across the three groups and between groups [Table 2].

- **Occurrence of clinical stroke and imaging-based cerebral infarction**:

- **At baseline**: 215 CT scans and 225 MRI scans were available, which detected 32 (14.8%) and 72 (31%) infarctions, respectively.
- **MRI at one month**: Was available for 188 patients and at three months was available for 172 patients. MRI detected new infarctions compared to the baseline in 21 (11.2%) patients: six (9.8%) in the aspirin group, eight (12.3%) in the clopidogrel group, and seven (11.3%) in the standard treatment group.
- **At three months**: MRI detected new infarctions compared to the MRI at one month in seven (4.1%) patients: two (3.5%) in the aspirin group, three (5.0%) in the clopidogrel group, and two (3.6%) in the standard treatment group.

There was no significant difference in the occurrence of MRI-detected infarctions across the groups.

### A randomised trial to assess the efficacy of add on therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel to the standard medical therapy alone in patients with tubercular meningitis: ACT TBM [^117V3iy5]. The Lancet Regional Health. Southeast Asia (2025). High credibility.

Tubercular meningitis (TBM) remains the most serious form of extrapulmonary TB, with high rates of death and disability. Ischemic stroke in TBM is an important cause of mortality and morbidity, typically affecting the small and medium-sized intracranial vessels. The mechanism is presumed to be inflammatory in origin, leading to endarteritis, local thrombosis, or accelerated atherosclerosis. Occurrence of cerebral infarction can be silent or present as a clinical stroke or worsening sensorium. Approximately 17–64% and 45–50% of patients with TBM show evidence of infarction on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, respectively, with or without clinical features suggestive of stroke.

Aspirin and clopidogrel are antiplatelet agents commonly used for the secondary prevention of ischemic cerebrovascular disease. Aspirin may have an additional benefit due to its anti-inflammatory effect and has been studied previously in TBM. In two former studies, the absolute risk reduction in the prevention of stroke was 19.1% and 16.2%, respectively. Pooled analysis observed no reduction in mortality but a significant reduction in the rate of new stroke, with a hazard ratio of 0.51 (95% CI 0.29–0.87, p = 0.01). However, these studies are limited by small sample sizes or methodological concerns, and the results are too variable to draw specific recommendations. Clopidogrel has not been evaluated previously in TBM.

The present study is aimed at investigating the effect of aspirin and clopidogrel on the occurrence of clinical stroke and/or cerebral infar.

### A randomised trial to assess the efficacy of add on therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel to the standard medical therapy alone in patients with tubercular meningitis: ACT TBM [^112CuiCk]. The Lancet Regional Health. Southeast Asia (2025). Low credibility.

The benefit of antiplatelet therapy for stroke prevention or treatment among patients with tubercular meningitis (TBM) is uncertain. We hypothesized that add-on therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel to standard treatment would be safe and effective in reducing clinical stroke and/or cerebral infarction in patients with TBM.

- **Methods**: This was a randomized, open-label, superiority trial with blinded outcome assessment. Patients with suspected TBM were randomized to receive either add-on oral aspirin 75 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg along with ATT (anti-tubercular treatment), or only ATT. Clinical follow-up, MRI brain, and MR Angiogram were performed at baseline, one, and three months from randomization. The primary outcome was the reduction in the occurrence of clinical stroke and/or imaging-based cerebral infarction at one and three months. The safety outcome was the occurrence of major or minor bleeding. Key secondary outcomes included mortality at one and three months and modified Rankin scale (mRS) at three months.

- **Findings**: A total of 237 patients with TBM were randomized (77 in the aspirin group, 77 in the clopidogrel group, and 83 in the standard treatment group). At one month, clinical stroke outcome was available for 66 (85.7%), 72 (93.5%), and 69 (83.1%) patients, and MRI brain was available for 61 (79.2%), 65 (84.4%), and 62 (74.7%) patients, respectively. Clinical stroke was observed in one (1.5%) patient in the aspirin group, none (0.0%) in the clopidogrel group, and three (4.3%) patients in the standard group (across group comparison p = 0.2); imaging-based cerebral infarction was observed in six (9.8%).
