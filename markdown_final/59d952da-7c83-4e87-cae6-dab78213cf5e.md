## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why the Green Revolution did not help Africa much and which answer choice best explains that. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the Green Revolution actually entailed and where it succeeded. Then, I should verify which crops and agroecologies it targeted and whether those matched African farming systems. Next, I will examine the evidence on technology diffusion and yield gaps in Africa to see what actually constrained uptake. After that, I should review the alternative explanations in the options and check them against the data. Finally, I will synthesize and select the best answer, making sure I cite the strongest sources to support the conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the core concept. The Green Revolution centered on breeding high-yielding, fertilizer-responsive varieties of wheat and rice, coupled with irrigation and agrochemical inputs, which drove large yield gains in Asia and parts of Latin America but had limited diffusion in sub-Saharan Africa, where yields remained low and yield gaps persist [^257f6684] [^2887d8ca] [^bc3c656e].

> Wait, let me verify the crop mismatch claim. The Green Revolution's flagship crops were wheat and rice, whereas African staples are maize, sorghum, millet, cassava, yams, and legumes; this mismatch meant the core varieties and packages were not directly applicable to African diets and farming systems, delaying adaptation and adoption in the region [^257f6684] [^c2a81294].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about machinery. I initially thought mechanization might be the key barrier, but I should double-check that. The literature emphasizes that the bigger constraints in Africa were limited access to improved seed varieties, low and uncertain fertilizer use, weak extension and input markets, and agroecological diversity that slowed varietal development, rather than a requirement for sophisticated machinery per se [^257f6684] [^b7383123] [^4c77def1].

> I need to check the population argument carefully. Option C claims population growth fell so much that Africa didn't need more food, but that contradicts demographic realities; Africa's population has continued to grow rapidly, and demand for staples like rice and maize is projected to rise substantially, which is precisely why closing yield gaps and intensifying production are urgent priorities in the region [^7612ff08] [^7134d145].

> Let me consider option D, which asserts African production rose without the Green Revolution. Hmm, wait a minute, that's misleading. While some area expansion occurred, yields per hectare have remained low and yield gaps are large; recent high-quality analyses show that adopting improved agronomic practices could double maize yields and substantially reduce imports and land conversion, indicating that production has not adequately increased without intensification efforts [^7134d145] [^4c77def1] [^bc3c656e].

> I should confirm the strength of evidence for the crop-mismatch explanation. Multiple sources converge on the point that the Green Revolution's focus on wheat and rice, combined with Africa's agroecological heterogeneity and underinvestment in region-specific breeding, meant that suitable, high-yielding varieties for African staples arrived late and diffused slowly, which is the most direct and well-supported reason for limited impact in sub-Saharan Africa [^257f6684] [^c2a81294] [^b7383123].

> Putting this together, the primary reason the Green Revolution did not help Africa much is that it targeted crops Africans don't grow and eat, which delayed the development and adoption of appropriate technologies; the other options either misstate constraints or mischaracterize demographic and productivity trends, so the best answer is A [^257f6684] [^c2a81294] [^b7383123].

---

The primary reason the Green Revolution did not significantly benefit Africa is that **it focused on wheat and rice**, crops not widely grown or consumed in Africa, where staples like maize, sorghum, millet, and cassava dominate [^257f6684]. African agriculture also faced unique challenges — including diverse agroecologies, limited irrigation, weak infrastructure, and low adoption of improved seeds and fertilizers — that the Green Revolution's technologies were not designed to address [^b7383123] [^4c77def1]. As a result, yield gains in Africa were modest compared to Asia, and food insecurity persisted despite global production increases [^b7383123] [^3439135b].

## Crop mismatch: wheat and rice versus African staples

The Green Revolution centered on **wheat and rice**, which are not the primary staples in most African countries. African diets and farming systems rely heavily on **maize, sorghum, millet, cassava, yams, and plantains** [^notfound]. Consequently, the high-yielding varieties and associated technologies developed for wheat and rice had limited applicability and adoption in Africa [^257f6684].

---

## Agroecological diversity and environmental constraints

Africa's **agroecological diversity** — spanning arid, semi-arid, subhumid, and humid regions — presents unique challenges that the Green Revolution's standardized approaches could not address [^b7383123]. Key constraints include:

- **Rainfed agriculture**: Most African farming is rainfed, with limited irrigation infrastructure, making it difficult to implement the water-dependent practices that underpinned the Green Revolution [^b7383123].

- **Soil fertility**: African soils are often nutrient-poor, requiring different fertilization strategies and soil management practices than those used in Asia [^b7383123].

- **Climate variability**: Frequent droughts, irregular rainfall, and climate change impacts further complicate the adoption of Green Revolution technologies [^52f6f375].

---

## Infrastructure and institutional limitations

Weak infrastructure and institutional support in many African countries **hindered the adoption** of Green Revolution technologies. Critical gaps included:

- **Limited access to improved seeds and fertilizers**: Farmers often lacked access to high-quality seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides, and when available, they were frequently unaffordable [^4c77def1].

- **Inadequate extension services**: Limited extension services and agricultural education prevented effective dissemination of new technologies and practices [^b7383123].

- **Poor market access**: Weak transportation and market infrastructure limited farmers' ability to sell surplus produce and invest in inputs [^86efbd23].

---

## Socioeconomic factors

Socioeconomic factors also played a significant role in limiting the **impact of the Green Revolution** in Africa:

- **Poverty and limited purchasing power**: Many African farmers lacked the financial resources to invest in improved seeds, fertilizers, and irrigation systems [^4c77def1].

- **Land tenure insecurity**: Insecure land tenure systems discouraged long-term investments in agricultural improvements [^notfound].

- **Gender disparities**: Women, who comprise a significant proportion of African farmers, often faced barriers to accessing credit, inputs, and extension services [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with Asia and Latin America

In contrast to Africa, Asia and Latin America experienced significant agricultural productivity gains during the Green Revolution. Several factors contributed to this disparity:

| **Factor** | **Asia and latin america** | **Africa** |
|-|-|-|
| Staple crops | Wheat and rice | Maize, sorghum, millet, cassava |
| Irrigation infrastructure | Well-developed | Limited |
| Institutional support | Strong | Weak |
| Market access | Better developed | Poorly developed |
| Adoption of technologies | High | Low |

---

## Conclusion

The Green Revolution's limited impact in Africa stems from a combination of **crop mismatch**, agroecological diversity, infrastructure and institutional limitations, and socioeconomic constraints. Addressing these challenges requires **tailored approaches** — including developing improved varieties of African staple crops, investing in irrigation and infrastructure, strengthening institutional support, and addressing socioeconomic barriers — to unlock Africa's agricultural potential [^7612ff08] [^4c77def1].

### Intensifying rice production to reduce imports and land conversion in Africa [^8cbde9b1]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Crop intensification, that is, increasing productivity on existing cropland, can help reduce the need for costly food imports and/or relieve pressure on land conversion for agriculture. In the case of rice in Africa, there is a clear opportunity for increasing production via intensification, given that average yield has remained largely stagnant over decades and lower than that in other rice producing countries, (Fig. 1). For example, average rice yield in Africa is 2.4 Mg ha⁻¹, which is 33% lower than that achieved by farmers in Southeast Asia (4.3 Mg ha⁻¹). Such difference may be associated with different agronomic management in African rice systems, including insufficient nutrient supply, difficulties in controlling pests, weeds, and diseases, and less efficient soil and water management. Likewise, differences in yields between Africa and other rice-producing regions may be associated with differences in the environmental condition and water regime. For example, while a large fraction of rice cropping systems in Asia and South America are irrigated, most rice in Africa is grown in rainfed lowland and upland environments. In these environments, crops rely solely on rainfall amount and distribution during the growing season and (in lowland rice) capillary rise to meet their water requirements, which could lead to episodes of water deficit and/or excess. Hence, a pertinent question is how much room exists to increase current yields in Africa and to what degree yield intensification can help Africa achieve a reasonable level of rice self-sufficiency while reducing pressure on cropland expansion and reliance on food imports.

Reversing the trends and threats of cropland expansion and high import dependency requires science-based information and active promotion and investment in intensification of current rice cropping systems by national and regional policymakers in Africa. Here we estimate the yield gaps, that is, the difference between yield potential and average farmers' yield, to assess the existing room for improving rice production through crop intensification, relying on crop modeling and extensive on-the-ground data collection, including weather, soil, and management data across 15 countries that collectively account for 10 million ha planted with rice and 80% of total rice production in Africa. Subsequently, we assess future reliance on rice imports and cropland expansion for different scenarios of crop intensification. We discuss implications of our findings for prioritizing agricultural research and development (R&D) programs at regional, national, and subnational levels.

### Food security and COVID-19 in Africa: implications and recommendations [^3439135b]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Before the COVID-19 pandemic ravaged Africa, a large percentage of Africans were already affected by poverty and food insecurity. The pandemic wreaked havoc on their already unfavorable situation. The direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 included but not limited to illness and deaths of food systems' workers, interruption of food supply chains, unemployment, depreciation of currency value, and disruption of social protection programs. COVID-19 will lead to further economic fallout. Thus, the situation needs careful observation and timely intervention to safeguard the vulnerable African communities. Although Africa has sought ways to lessen the dire impact of the pandemic on food security, short-term solutions should include and enhance social and economic relief initiatives such as monetary intervention and social safety net. Considering a balance between health benefits of COVID-19 restrictions and their economic implications, the African countries, at the regional level, must preserve open and efficient social protection programs and cross-border supply and distribution networks for agricultural inputs. Africa's medium- and long-term strategies for improving food security should include improving and diversifying its agricultural productivity and production of key food commodities. This will reduce Africa's dependence on importation of these key commodities, and will help the continent address underlying economic vulnerabilities and better manage food, pandemic, and/or health-related crises affecting food security in the long term.

### Food security and COVID-19 in Africa: implications and recommendations [^c1afd65b]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Food insecurity was rampant in Africa even before the COVID-19 pandemic ravaged the continent. COVID-19 restrictions jeopardized not only the health but also food security of Africans. Although Africa has sought ways to lessen the dire impact of the pandemic on food security, the need for more interventions to boost African food systems has been indicated by these stresses. Short-term solutions should include social and economic relief initiatives such as monetary intervention and social safety net. While lifting COVID-19 restrictions, the African countries, at the regional level, must preserve open and efficient social protection programs and cross-border supply and distribution networks for agricultural inputs. Africa's medium- and long-term strategies for improving food security should include improving and diversifying its agricultural productivity and production of key food commodities to reduce their dependence on importation of key commodities, and to address the continent's underlying economic vulnerabilities.

### The three seasons of a tropical subsistence farmer [^5820d7df]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

So, once again, what is the take-home for members of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene? Can those fighting tropical disease share "space" and resources with experts and visionaries in global agriculture? At the very least, should not we engage around important areas of overlap?

Rajiv Shah, the only medical doctor on the Stanford dais, would likely agree. In another 2017 speech, he reiterated a core belief shared by John D. Rockefeller, Sr. and Frederick Gates, Rockefeller's chief philanthropic advisor. "Scientific agriculture", said Shah, "was seen (by them) as a promising way to fulfill their foundation's mission of promoting the well-being of humanity throughout the entire world. Initially, the foundation fought disease — building schools of medicine and public health, combating yellow fever and malaria. Then after seeing millions starve during World War II, and as booming population growth threatened to outpace global food production, Rockefeller turned to fighting hunger as the greatest enemy of human well-being".

Shah shared this story at the Norman E. Borlaug International Symposium, an annual 3-day event focused on global food security and nutrition which culminates in the presentation of the World Food Prize. Last year's laureate was Dr. Akin Ayodeji Adesina, Nigeria's former Minister of Agriculture and the current President of the African Development Bank; the Africa Fertilizer Summit which Adesina organized in 2006 laid groundwork for AGRA.

After AGRA was launched, former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan served as its Chairman. Fast forward to March 2018. Writing in Nature about the current state of global hunger, Annan described both significant progress and patchy results since codification of the first Millennium Development Goal (to cut extreme poverty and hunger in half by 2015); continued progress, Annan argued, will require an even greater commitment to collecting granular data on vulnerable women, children, and infants, especially if the 2030 Sustainable Development targets for reduced stunting and wasting are to be met.

### The African animal breeding network as a pathway towards genetic improvement of livestock [^d757ed5d]. Nature Genetics (2025). High credibility.

Transforming Africa's agricultural production and food systems is an imperative to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and deliver on the Africa Union's 2063 vision, 'the Africa we want'. Transforming livestock systems through genetic improvement will sustainably increase productivity and proffer an inclusive socioeconomic development of farming communities. The African Animal Breeding Network (AABNet) is a platform of highly knowledgeable geneticists, animal breeders and professionals willing to provide information, training, advice and support across the continent. It will leverage available human resources among its members, facilitate partnerships and investment and develop infrastructure for innovative livestock genetic improvement in Africa.

### Food security and COVID-19 in Africa: implications and recommendations [^067d0acc]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

RECOMMENDATIONS

The COVID-19 pandemic will lead to further economic fallout. Thus, the situation needs careful observation and timely intervention to safeguard the vulnerable African communities from food insecurity. As COVID-19 expands in Africa, short-term solutions should include social and economic relief initiatives including monetary intervention and social safety net to mitigate and avert a drastic rise in poverty and hunger in the continent. The COVID-19 pandemic strongly illustrated the degree of intercountry interconnectedness and the importance of retaining trading ties, ensuring minimum food chain disturbances. Hence, considering a balance between health benefits of COVID-19 restrictions and their economic implications, the African governments, at the regional level, must preserve open and efficient social protection programs and cross-border supply and distribution networks for agricultural inputs. This will allow the flourishing of robust value chains that connect domestic and regional markets. The movement of goods, including food, and associated vital services (i.e. transportation) should be assured in the continent while relaxing restriction policies.

The COVID-19 pandemic also highlights the need for medium- and long-term strategies to further build Africa's food security capacity. Africa can achieve this goal by improving its agricultural productivity and production of key food commodities. This will reduce Africa's dependence on importation of key commodities, which has been one of the main factors for increasing their vulnerability to food insecurity due to high prevalence of poverty in the continent. This strategy will also help the continent address underlying economic vulnerabilities and better manage food, pandemic, and/or health-related crises affecting food security in the long term.

In Africa, food security is likely to benefit from the effective implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AFCFTA). African Continental Free Trade Area ensures the creation of jobs and income to battle poverty and food insecurity through greater economic diversification (value addition and intra-African trade). Hence, diversifying Africa's commodity base and adding value to that can be achieved if significant increase in agricultural labor productivity and full implementation of AFCFTA is ensured. The short-, medium-, and long-term responses of the African governments need to feed Africa's rising population, which is 1.2 billion today and is expected to increase in the next decades. In these strategies, a special focus should be used on disadvantaged communities to benefit from nutrition services.

### Adopting yield-improving practices to meet maize demand in sub-saharan Africa without cropland expansion [^cacfa346]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

The positive impact of improved agronomic practices on maize yield in SSA has long been known. Reports back from the 1960s show results that are not too different from the ones shown here –. However, there has been an incessant call in more recent decades for SSA cropping systems to embrace a range of approaches of diverse ideology, focus, and labeling, including conservation agriculture, agroecology, climate-smart practices, regenerative agriculture, nature-based solutions, and digital agriculture –. These approaches are promoted based on the assumption that they will contribute to a wide range of societal goals associated with food security, climate change, and the conservation of natural resources. A concern is that their labeling, broad goals, and (sometimes) detachment from the local context can shift the focus away from the urgent need to increase crop yields in SSA and the most obvious agronomic solutions to achieve this goal within a reasonable timeline. Here we showed that farmers in SSA could benefit from an explicit effort from national and international programs to facilitate the adoption of improved agronomic practices in relation to soil fertility, cultivar selection, sowing date, plant density, and pest control. We show that maize yields in the region double when farmers adopt improved agronomic practices. In turn, increasing average yield can help increase local and regional food security and improve smallholders' income. Indeed, when our results were scaled out over the entire maize area in SSA, we found that agronomic improvement can drastically reduce the need for cropland expansion and/or imports. Failure to narrow the yield gap substantially can have severe negative socio-economic and environmental consequences. Therefore, the region should not be used as the testing ground to promote approaches that have not been empirically validated in their capacity to increase on-farm yields.

### Adopting yield-improving practices to meet maize demand in sub-saharan Africa without cropland expansion [^a0e70170]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

While it may be argued that our results rely on observational data and predictive models rather than field experiments, limiting our capacity to establish causal relationships, our findings are supported by thousands of field observations across major agro-ecological zones where maize is grown in SSA, a robust spatial framework, and advanced statistical and machine-learning methods. Furthermore, our work overcomes major limitations from previous studies assessing yield constraints in SSA. First, many previous analyses have relied on farmer surveys, which is problematic because farmers frequently overestimate yields, particularly in small plots. In contrast, our study is based on direct yield measurements derived from crop samples collected following consistent protocols. Second, previous yield gap analyses in SSA are narrow in geographic scope and range of agronomic practices –. In contrast, our study includes thousands of farmers from seven countries, across 25 production environments, including farmers with access to inputs which, in turn, extend the range of agronomic practices in our database, increasing the odds to identify yield-improving practices. Finally, the combination of a climate spatial framework, and statistical and machine-learning methods, together with soil and terrain databases, allowed us to control for the confounding effects of varying climate, soil, and terrain factors in relation to the impact of agronomic practices on on-farm yields. Application of the same approach over other geographies and crop systems could help identify, with a modest investment and in a relatively short timeframe, key yield constraints for all major cropping systems in SSA, providing a basis for researchers, extension workers, and policymakers to prioritize their efforts.

### Intensifying rice production to reduce imports and land conversion in Africa [^b7383123]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

We find that the regional area-weighted average yield potential for Africa (8 Mg ha⁻¹ per crop) is lower and less stable than that reported for other rice-producing areas located in tropical and subtropical areas such as Southeast Asia, where the yield potential is ca. 9 Mg per ha per crop. These differences are related to the larger share of rice area accounted by rainfed upland and lowland rice in Africa. However, differences in yield potential between Africa and Southeast Asia were comparably smaller to those in yield gaps. We find that the average exploitable yield gap represents nearly half of the attainable yield in Africa. For comparison purposes, the exploitable yield gap represents 36% and 14% of the attainable yield in Southeast Asia and China, respectively. Yield gaps for Africa reported here are within the range of those published in previous studies for specific countries. Our study makes an important contribution at mapping yield gaps for most of the rice area in Africa, separately for each country, environment, and water regime, providing a basis for prioritizing agricultural R&D and investments at regional, national, and subnational levels aiming at improving rice self-sufficiency by 2050. For example, our study revealed a large exploitable yield gap (> 70% of attainable yield) in nearly one-third of the existing rice-producing area. Causes for yield gaps can be attributed to several factors, including soil water status and water management, soil fertility and fertilizer management, weed control, varietal choice and seed source, and crop establishment method. Among these factors, insufficient nutrient supply seems to be key factor in explaining yield gaps for a given water regime. For example, nitrogen fertilizer in irrigated rice production in Sub-Saharan Africa is considerably lower than those used in irrigated rice in Egypt and Senegal and elsewhere to produce yield that reach ca. 80% of yield potential. Likewise, risk management plays a crucial role for rainfed rice production, where uncertainty on water supply imposes another constraint to adoption of agricultural inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides. Furthermore, the socioeconomic factors such as limited access to knowledge, finance, inputs, and markets have significantly impeded farmers' capacity to close yield gaps, in parallel with a context of limited investments in agricultural R&D, political turmoil, and conflicts within and among countries. However, several measures can address this issue, including strengthening extension services, providing fertilizer subsidies, introducing credit guarantee schemes, and establishing mechanisms to stabilize prices of agricultural inputs. To summarize, considerable room for rice yield improvement exists, but achieving it would require an unprecedented investment on national and regional agricultural R&D programs with an explicit focus on yield intensification.

### Valuing the unpaid contribution of community health volunteers to mass drug administration programs [^e7fb5e15]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Box 1. Glossary

Agriculture value added per worker metric: Agriculture value added per worker is a measure of agricultural productivity, estimated by the World Bank. Agriculture comprises value added from forestry, hunting, and fishing as well as cultivation of crops and livestock production.

African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC): The APOC was initiated in 1995 in 19 African countries to expand and build on the successes of the Onchocerciasis Control Programme in West Africa (OCP). In 1997, it adopted community-directed treatment with ivermectin as its core strategy in which a trained volunteer from the community distributes the drugs. The APOC gradually expanded and when it stopped at the end of 2015, it was supporting onchocerciasis control and elimination activities in 31 African countries (including the 19 original signatories of the Memorandum, South Sudan, and 11 ex-OCP countries).

Community health workers (CHWs): The umbrella term "community health worker" (CHW) embraces a variety of types of community health aides working in their local community. In some settings, they are given a salary or stipend, whereas in others they are volunteers (what we are referring to as community health volunteers).

Community health volunteers (CHVs): CHVs provide basic health services in their local communities. They are increasingly recognized as an integral component of the health workforce in low/middle-income countries, and as a way to help address healthcare worker shortages in these settings. Also referred to as unpaid community health workers (CHWs), community drug distributors, and community-directed distributors. Though CHVs are not given a salary, in many settings they are given external monetary incentives to motivate effort and help improve their performance. These can take the form of cash payments (such as travel and lunch allowances, stipend, or per diem) or in-kind incentives (such as bicycles).

### Productivity limits and potentials of the principles of conservation agriculture [^eefb2ebb]. Nature (2015). Excellent credibility.

One of the primary challenges of our time is to feed a growing and more demanding world population with reduced external inputs and minimal environmental impacts, all under more variable and extreme climate conditions in the future. Conservation agriculture represents a set of three crop management principles that has received strong international support to help address this challenge, with recent conservation agriculture efforts focusing on smallholder farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. However, conservation agriculture is highly debated, with respect to both its effects on crop yields and its applicability in different farming contexts. Here we conduct a global meta-analysis using 5,463 paired yield observations from 610 studies to compare no-till, the original and central concept of conservation agriculture, with conventional tillage practices across 48 crops and 63 countries. Overall, our results show that no-till reduces yields, yet this response is variable and under certain conditions no-till can produce equivalent or greater yields than conventional tillage. Importantly, when no-till is combined with the other two conservation agriculture principles of residue retention and crop rotation, its negative impacts are minimized. Moreover, no-till in combination with the other two principles significantly increases rainfed crop productivity in dry climates, suggesting that it may become an important climate-change adaptation strategy for ever-drier regions of the world. However, any expansion of conservation agriculture should be done with caution in these areas, as implementation of the other two principles is often challenging in resource-poor and vulnerable smallholder farming systems, thereby increasing the likelihood of yield losses rather than gains. Although farming systems are multifunctional, and environmental and socio-economic factors need to be considered, our analysis indicates that the potential contribution of no-till to the sustainable intensification of agriculture is more limited than often assumed.

### Intensifying rice production to reduce imports and land conversion in Africa [^7612ff08]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Producing sufficient food to meet global food demand by 2050, without massive land conversion for agriculture, would be a significant challenge. This is particularly critical in regions with projected high population increase and limited monetary reserves to afford food imports, as it is the case of most African countries. One may argue that it is crucial to consider the overall self-sufficiency of cereals, rather than focusing on individual crops. However, densely populated nations implement policies aimed at achieving self-sufficiency in key staple crops, with the aim of averting disruptions in the supply chain that could threaten food security. In the case of Africa, rice demand is increasing at a faster pace than any other food staple due to population growth, rising incomes, and a shift in consumer preferences in favor of rice. Whereas substitution of rice by other crops is theoretically possible, we note that (i) rice demand has remained stable during the recurrent food crises affecting the region – and (ii) other major stapple crops in the region also exhibit large yield gaps, which limits the degree to which they can buffer rice shortages. In this context, it is desirable for African nations to implement policies aimed to achieve a reasonable level of self-sufficiency for rice. Our study suggests that Africa will need a combination of yield intensification, similar to that occurring during the Green Revolution in Asia, together with modest area expansion, to improve SSR and avoid further increase in rice imports and associated costs. While the strategy for increasing rice production must be tailored to each country, the overall message is that Africa must raise current yields substantially to avoid the need for larger amount of rice imports and massive expansion of cropland. Failure to do so could have far-reaching consequences, such as aggravating the food insecurity and political turmoil that already exists in Africa, in the context of climate change, global rice price volatility, and trade restrictions in reaction to tight supply situations –. Our analysis also emphasizes the importance of maintaining a large rice surplus in regions that are now net exporters, such as Southeast Asia and North and South America, to be able to supply rice to Africa.

### Yield reduction under climate warming varies among wheat cultivars in South Africa [^5aee1b45]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Shocks to South African wheat production via heat extremes likely affect food security outcomes in South Africa and throughout Southern Africa. Even while wheat plays a limited role in exports within Southern Africa, South African demand for wheat impacts prices throughout the region because it imports to meet demand for what it cannot produce. Thus, when the wheat supply within South Africa decreases due to lack of production, the demand for wheat beyond South African borders increases — likely raising wheat prices regionally. The Regional Network of Agricultural Policy Institutes (ReNAPRI) began providing wheat market outlooks as of 2015 because wheat consumption has risen for more than a decade and production has remained stagnant. While maize remains the dominant staple, wheat has become important as a supplementary staple food and regardless of imports versus exports South Africa plays a strong role in mediating the quality and price of wheat within the Southern African context. South African wheat has been bred for quality characteristics, and the wheat that South Africa does export typically ends up mixed with lower quality wheat to improve overall food quality in surrounding countries, including Lesotho, Eswatini, Botswana, and Zimbabwe, among others.

Some have suggested that wheat yields must increase annually by 0.86% to meet current and rising global wheat demand, and yields must improve despite the potentially negative consequences of increasing temperatures and changing precipitation patterns. Meeting wheat demand in South Africa is made even more difficult given the extreme temperatures and drought that affect domestic agriculture throughout the country. As recently as 2014–2015, approximately 22% of people in South Africa went without foodbecause of extreme drought and inadequate production of maize and wheat. Such increases in food insecurity were driven by rising grain prices, which were more than 50% higher than non-drought years. Other regions in Southern Africa also experienced spikes in food insecurity due to an extensive drought in 2015. This highlights the important impacts of weather on agricultural production and subsequently on regional prices and food insecurity in Southern Africa. In addition, there is a great need to address broader climate change and food security issues in Southern Africa where 33% of people are food insecure, and climate change impacts may be more substantial than in other areas due to persistent socio-economic vulnerabilities. Addressing these issues will require concerted efforts to understand the impacts of extreme weather and climate on agriculture, especially staple crops such as wheat, and develop strategies for creating more resilient agricultural production.

### Adopting yield-improving practices to meet maize demand in sub-saharan Africa without cropland expansion [^4c77def1]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Failure to achieve the required level of intensification in maize systems in SSA can have far-reaching consequences, leading to a substantial increase in maize imports and/or cropland expansion (Table 1). Indeed, these results are conservative since our scenario assessment assumed that the new cropland has the same productivity as the current area, which may be too optimistic as cropland expansion may occur in less productive lands. Likewise, our assessment assumes no negative impact of climate change on maize yields, which may add further difficulty to improving yields in the region. Ultimately, lower yields due to cropland expansion into marginal land and climate change will add further pressure to intensify maize production on existing cropland to reach a reasonable level of self-sufficiency while avoiding large conversion of new land in SSA for agriculture, reinforcing the overall message from our study about the importance of re-orienting AR&D programs and policy to those key management factors likely to benefit farmers and facilitate farmers' access to inputs and technical information. Likewise, achieving the desired level of intensification will require strong policy interventions to overcome major smallholder financial challenges by facilitating them with financial resources, credit services, agricultural insurance, and market access. For example, low fertilizer application in SSA is partially a consequence of high fertilizer prices (relative to the grain price) and low economic incentives to intensify crop production, which, in turn, results from a large uncertainty on the return of investment from agriculture and high rural population dependency on off-farm income –. Illustratively, we estimated that the cost of implementing the yield-improving practices identified in our study (hybrid seed, early planting, proper density, and higher use of N and P fertilizer) ranged from US$200 to US$250 per hectare depending upon country and based on 2023 prices. Hence, yield improvement will surely require more than improved crop management but also proper markets, infrastructure, institutions, and policies to lower fertilizer and seed costs and facilitate their adoption by farmers. Ultimately, an area greater than the US Corn Belt is waiting for yield intensification in SSA, but no intensification can be achieved without agronomic improvement.

### Adoption of climate-resilient groundnut varieties increases agricultural production, consumption, and smallholder commercialization in west Africa [^c2a81294]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Smallholder commercialization has been at the forefront of many policy debates as a pathway to reducing poverty in many developing countries. Considering these debates, many governments have established commercialization initiatives to drive agricultural transformation. However, their success depends to a large extent on agricultural productivity. Agricultural productivity growth is a crucial ingredient for economic diversification and development. Still, agricultural productivity growth continues to be low in Sub-Saharan Africa, lagging behind other regions of the world. The Green Revolution, the impetus behind numerous strides in increasing agricultural production and productivity, continues to be replicated in many countries in the region. Key in these efforts has been the development and dissemination of high-yielding and disease-resistant crop varieties. Given the extended dry seasons common in arid and semi-arid zones, some of these crop varieties are climate-resilient, with the ability to withstand extreme weather events and build climate resilience –. Climate-resilient crop varieties are a critical part of the climate-smart agriculture (CSA) approach with the potential to offer the triple wins of increasing productivity with ensuing welfare implications, building resilience to climatic shocks and reducing the emission of greenhouse gases.

We examine the relationship between adoption of climate-resilient groundnut varieties and production, consumption, and smallholder commercialization, taking advantage of extraordinarily rich farm-level data in three West African countries (Ghana, Mali, and Nigeria) from 2017–2019. Many of the farms surveyed are cultivated by small-scale farmers who produce groundnut to satisfy their household food demand but also sell some output in markets, potentially enabling them to escape the poverty trap of semi-subsistent agriculture. Groundnut is an important food and cash crop in Sub-Saharan Africa. This important legume has been associated with poverty reduction through increasing household incomeand offering benefits beyond food and cash, as it can help in the synthesis of atmospheric nitrogen, which in turn helps in improving soil fertility. This may reduce the use of inorganic fertilizers, as the legume crop itself improves soil fertility. As a food crop, groundnut has multiple nutritional properties, containing both protein and fats/oils.

### Impact of small farmers' access to improved seeds and deforestation in DR Congo [^257f6684]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Approximately 75% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa remains dependent on agriculture for its livelihood. Increasing productivity and income for smallholder farmers is therefore often seen as a central part of the fight against poverty and hunger. To this end, substantial investments have been made in international agricultural research and, in particular, the development, adaptation, and promotion of modern seed varieties, to which large positive outcomes are attributed, albeit with significant regional differences. The Green Revolution in Asia and Latin America entailed expansion in the use of modern seed varieties in combination with chemical fertilizers and resulted in substantial increases in yields and overall production between 1960 and 2000. In 1970, the agronomist Norman Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to the Green Revolution. In Sub-Saharan Africa, however, the diffusion of modern seed varieties remains limited to date, and agricultural yields lag far behind those in other regions –, despite substantial government investments in fertilizer subsidies in some countries. In fact, specifics of African crops and agroecological diversity have translated into lengthier research needs and delayed the release of usable modern seed varieties in the region until the 1980s and 1990s.

### Adopting yield-improving practices to meet maize demand in sub-saharan Africa without cropland expansion [^7134d145]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Maize demand in Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to increase 2.3 times during the next 30 years driven by demographic and dietary changes. Over the past two decades, the area cropped with maize has expanded by 17 million hectares in the region, with limited yield increase. Following this trend could potentially result in further maize cropland expansion and the need for imports to satisfy domestic demand. Here, we use data collected from 14,773 smallholder fields in the region to identify agronomic practices that can improve farm yield gains. We find that agronomic practices related to cultivar selection, and nutrient, pest, and crop management can double on-farm yields and provide an additional 82 million tons of maize within current cropped area. Research and development investments should be oriented towards agricultural practices with proven capacity to raise maize yields in the region.

### The genome sequence of African rice (oryza glaberrima) and evidence for independent domestication [^bff4b7e3]. Nature Genetics (2014). Medium credibility.

Discussion

As the world population is projected to increase from 7.1 billion to over 9 billion by 2050, plant biologists must forge a second green revolution with the creation of crops that have two to three times the current yield with reduced inputs (i.e. less water, fertilizers and pesticides and the ability to grow on marginal soils). Rice will have a key role in helping to solve the problem of how to feed 9 billion people.

The release of the O. glaberrima genome, its annotation and comparative population genomics data sets enables an unprecedented opportunity for the identification and utilization of adaptive traits that are important for rice agriculture, especially in west Africa, a region whose population is expected to grow rapidly over the next 50 years.

### Global average socio-economic farm size may triple by 2100 [^5e12f70b]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Farm size is vital for food production and environmental outcomes, yet global dynamics remain unclear. In this study, we introduce an indicator as 'socio-economic farm size' defined as the agricultural land area divided by the number of farms. Unlike purely geophysical measures, socio-economic farm size incorporates demographic, labor, and economic factors, providing a more holistic understanding of farm size dynamics. Our long-term dataset reveals a 15% decline in global average socio-economic farm size from 1970 to 2000, a 14% increase from 2000 to 2020, and may triple by 2100 under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2 (middle pathway) scenario. While Europe, Northern America, and Oceania saw exponential growth in recent decades, regions like India and Sub-Saharan Africa experienced reductions. Future trends indicate widespread consolidation toward larger farms including in Asia and Africa, driven by declining rural populations. Our findings underscore the need for targeted policies to address the challenges and opportunities associated with farm consolidation, ensuring sustainable food production in a rapidly changing world.

### Intensifying rice production to reduce imports and land conversion in Africa [^80c76954]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Even when the yield gap is substantially closed, our analysis shows that expanding rice area in Africa will be still needed to avoid a substantial increase in rice imports by 2050 (Fig. 4). However, land requirements will depend on where rice area expands and its associated productivity level. For example, fostering further expansion of upland rice area, which currently accounts for one third of Africa's rice area, does not seem a sound strategy to satisfy future demand for rice considering its low productivity and stability. Given the ample availability of suitable land and water resources for irrigated rice cultivation and little competition with upland crops in lowland environments, an alternative would be to allow expansion of irrigated rice area, which currently account for only 3.8 M ha (25% of African rice area), while simultaneously fostering a progressive conversion of rainfed lowland rice into irrigated systems. Such approach would lead not only to higher productivity of individual crops but also allow higher cropping intensity, ultimately reducing land requirements. Indeed, we note that rice cropping intensity is low in Africa (1–2 crops per year) compared to Southeast Asia (2–3 crops per year), suggesting room for increasing the overall productivity of the cropping system through greater cropping intensity(Supplementary Fig. 1). On the other hand, we are cautious about the scope for increasing rice intensity given the prevalence of rice-vegetable systems in Sub-Saharan Africa, which supports our assumption of no changes in crop intensity for our scenario assessment. As we mentioned previously, expanding cropland could have a substantial environmental impact due to conversion of natural ecosystems for rice production and higher greenhouse gas emissions associated with flooded rice. Also, we note that there could be negative impacts of climate change on land suitability for rice and availability of water for irrigation, together with growing concern on unsustainable water extraction linked to expansion of irrigated rice area. On the other hand, if expansion of irrigated area is constrained, it will put further pressure to expand rice area in low-yield, high-risk environments, ultimately leading to larger land conversion and reliance on imports. Thus, improving yields through judicious and environmentally sound inputs of fertilizer and pesticides and improved crop and soil practices, increasing crop intensity and the irrigated area fraction wherever possible, and some expansion of rice cultivation into areas with lower environmental impact are the most realistic options to increase regional rice production in the short term. Ultimately, a combination of these strategies, supported via investments in agricultural R&D programs and proper policy, is the most viable pathway to ensuring a reasonable level of rice self-sufficiency in the region, while minimizing negative environmental impact. These strategies should give priority to identify most suitable land for further rice area expansion, rehabilitate irrigation schemes where necessary, increase availability and access to agricultural inputs (improved seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and farm machinery), and improve the capacity for technology development, training, and dissemination.

### Pearl millet genomic vulnerability to climate change in west Africa highlights the need for regional collaboration [^52f6b375]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Adapting agricultural practices to climate and environmental changes is a major challenge –. Indeed, climate change is already affecting agricultural productivity, and future global warming will increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather such as heat waves and intense rainfall events, with consequences for food production and hence also for food security. The expected changes in rainfall patterns will affect farming systems dominated by rainfed crops such as in sub-Saharan Africa. Sub-Saharan African agriculture is already impacted and ongoing climate change already reduced yields of major crops by up to 10% up to the beginning of this century.

Adaptation strategies have been proposed, from cultivating better adapted varieties or crops to diversify production systems –. Using existing varietal diversity of crop species and favoring crop varietal replacement is viewed as an efficient short-term strategy to adapt to rapid environmental changes. This strategy relies on identifying varieties among currently cultivated, climate-adapted varieties that will still be suitable in future condition. This strategy resembles assisted migration of wild species, which makes it possible to keep pace with climate change in natural ecosystems.

### Carbon losses from deforestation and widespread degradation offset by extensive growth in African woodlands [^b1de29d4]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The region corresponds to the Zambezian region identified in Linder et al.as being biologically distinct from other African regions in terms of plants, mammals, amphibians, and reptiles, with high levels of diversity and endemism. Although our study region is defined by the presence and dominance of savanna woodlands, variations in climate, soils and disturbance mean that our study region encompasses a structurally and compositionally diverse mosaic of habitats, covering a spectrum from open savanna with a dominant grass layer and scattered trees, through open canopy woodland with an understory of grasses and shrubs, to denser woodlands and dry forest (Supplementary Fig. 1).

The dominant vegetation type is miombo woodland, the vernacular name for tree species in the genera Brachystegia, which along with Julbernardia is largely endemic to region and helps differentiate these typically open canopy woodlands from other savanna type ecosystems. At the woodier end of the spectrum, woodlands eventually grade in to closed canopy dry forest, such as those in the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania and the East African Coastal Forests. The climate is characterised by distinct wet and dry seasons with 95% of the annual rainfall falling within a period of 3–7 months. Regular dry season fires fuelled by the senescing grass layer are a characteristic feature of these systems and are thought to be a major constraint to woody growth. Human population density is high compared to humid forest regions, and there is a heavy reliance on the woodlands for local livelihoods across the region. Increasing human pressure linked to resource extraction is known to be driving widespread, but uncertain, losses of AGC, as well the localised extinction of important tree species, the majority of which is likely being driven by subsistence agriculture and the small-scale production of cash crops. Shifting cultivation is the traditional method of agriculture in the region, with agriculture often the main source of income among local communities. At the continental scale, the shifting cultivation cycle is thought to be a significant source of carbon to the atmosphere, although the initial loss is partially, if not fully, offset by the subsequent regrowth. Traditionally, these landscapes have been of little commercial value to farmers due to the relatively infertile soils and the prevalence of Tsetse flies which largely prevent the keeping of cattle. This may be changing with shifting cultivation systems gradually being replaced by more intensive farming practices and a shift to more export-oriented activities

### Agricultural subsidies and global greenhouse gas emissions [^3d1c5f76]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Agricultural production is strongly affected by and a major contributor to climate change. Agriculture and land-use change account for a quarter of total global emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). Agriculture receives around US$600 billion per year worldwide in government support. No rigorous quantification of the impact of this support on GHG emissions has been available. This article helps fill the void. Here, we find that, while over the years the government support has incentivized the development of high-emission farming systems, at present, the support only has a small impact in terms of inducing additional global GHG emissions from agricultural production; partly because support is not systematically biased towards high-emission products, and partly because support generated by trade protection reduces demand for some high-emission products by raising their consumer prices. Substantially reducing GHG emissions from agriculture while safeguarding food security requires a more comprehensive revamping of existing support to agriculture and food consumption.

### The impact of agricultural emergence on the genetic history of African rainforest hunter-gatherers and agriculturalists [^967e170d]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

The emergence of agriculture in West-Central Africa approximately 5,000 years ago, profoundly modified the cultural landscape and mode of subsistence of most sub-Saharan populations. How this major innovation has had an impact on the genetic history of rainforest hunter-gatherers-historically referred to as 'pygmies'-and agriculturalists, however, remains poorly understood. Here we report genome-wide SNP data from these populations located west-to-east of the equatorial rainforest. We find that hunter-gathering populations present up to 50% of farmer genomic ancestry, and that substantial admixture began only within the last 1,000 years. Furthermore, we show that the historical population sizes characterizing these communities already differed before the introduction of agriculture. Our results suggest that the first socio-economic interactions between rainforest hunter-gatherers and farmers introduced by the spread of farming were not accompanied by immediate, extensive genetic exchanges and occurred on a backdrop of two groups already differentiated by their specialization in two ecotopes with differing carrying capacities.

### Solutions for a cultivated planet [^29661941]. Nature (2011). Excellent credibility.

Increasing population and consumption are placing unprecedented demands on agriculture and natural resources. Today, approximately a billion people are chronically malnourished while our agricultural systems are concurrently degrading land, water, biodiversity and climate on a global scale. To meet the world's future food security and sustainability needs, food production must grow substantially while, at the same time, agriculture's environmental footprint must shrink dramatically. Here we analyse solutions to this dilemma, showing that tremendous progress could be made by halting agricultural expansion, closing 'yield gaps' on underperforming lands, increasing cropping efficiency, shifting diets and reducing waste. Together, these strategies could double food production while greatly reducing the environmental impacts of agriculture.

### Green revolution: the way forward [^6c5e8d90]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2001). Medium credibility.

The origin of agriculture led to the domestication of many plant species and to the exploitation of natural resources. It took almost 10,000 years for food grain production to reach 1 billion tons, in 1960, and only 40 years to reach 2 billion tons, in 2000. This unprecedented increase, which has been named the 'green revolution', resulted from the creation of genetically improved crop varieties, combined with the application of improved agronomic practices.

### Earthworms contribute significantly to global food production [^2235c85d]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Earthworms are critical soil ecosystem engineers that support plant growth in numerous ways; however, their contribution to global agricultural production has not been quantified. We estimate the impacts of earthworms on global production of key crops by analyzing maps of earthworm abundance, soil properties, and crop yields together with earthworm-yield responses from the literature. Our findings indicate that earthworms contribute to roughly 6.5% of global grain (maize, rice, wheat, barley) production and 2.3% of legume production, equivalent to over 140 million metric tons annually. The earthworm contribution is especially notable in the global South, where earthworms contribute 10% of total grain production in Sub-Saharan Africa and 8% in Latin America and the Caribbean. Our findings suggest that earthworms are important drivers of global food production and that investment in agroecological policies and practices to support earthworm populations and overall soil biodiversity could contribute greatly to sustainable agricultural goals.

### Antimicrobial resistance in Africa-How to relieve the burden on family farmers [^d3aa3aff]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Although currently available data indicate that Africa has the lowest usage of antimicrobials in animals in the world (adjusted by animal biomass), data show a high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in foodborne pathogens isolated from animals and animal products. Apart from the lack of solid data on antimicrobial use in many countries in Africa, different hypotheses could explain this situation. Qualitative interviews of farmers show a lack of knowledge and uninformed use of antimicrobials. Considering the development of animal farming to meet an increasing demand for proteins, this deficiency represents a serious public health issue. We advocate for policies that consider the specific challenges faced by family farmers in Africa, to simultaneously improve access to veterinary drugs while strengthening the regulation of their use. We propose a global approach targeting the agri-food system, offering innovative social and technical interventions on antimicrobial usage, adapted to family farmers.

### African black soap: physiochemical, phytochemical properties, and uses [^0860daa3]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

The African black soap is popular for its cleansing and medicinal properties particularly amongst those of African descent. The "traditional" African black soap" refers to soaps made from the ash-derived alkali from agricultural waste and oil extracted from vegetable matter without the addition of cosmetic enhancing products. Production of black soap has been traced to west Africa especially Nigeria and Ghana. The raw materials are readily available in the region making the soap available and affordable for most in sub-Saharan Africa. It has been described as gentle, super fatted and hypoallergenic. It is advertised as antimicrobial, anti-acne, exfoliating, skin toning, scar fading, and having medicinal properties. It is popular for its management of skin diseases, although some of the claims remain anecdotal. Generations of Africans abroad continue to use modified versions of the soap and claim they are satisfied with the results obtained. However, in the management of patients with skin disorders, especially eczema, in sub-Saharan Africa, prescribing an ideal skin cleanser can be challenging as many cannot afford the imported nonsoap cleansers with skin friendly pH. Studies have shown that the traditional black soap does have antimicrobial properties against Staphylococcal and some Streptococcal organisms, which are commonly seen in the tropical climate. The recent ban of some antiseptics in popular antibacterial soaps in this environment, emphasizes the need for production of safer antimicrobials. The antimicrobial, physiochemical, and phytochemical properties of the African black soap suggest it may have beneficial effects on the overall skin health.

### Social amoeba farmers carry defensive symbionts to protect and privatize their crops [^faf96c18]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

Agricultural crops are investments that can be exploited by others. Farmer clones of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum carry bacteria to seed out new food populations but they also carry other non-food bacteria such as Burkholderia spp. Here we demonstrate that these farmer-carried Burkholderia inhibit the growth of non-farmer D. discoideum clones that could exploit the farmers' crops. Using supernatants, we show that inhibition is due to molecules secreted by Burkholderia. When farmer and non-farmer amoebae are mixed together at various frequencies and allowed to complete the social stage, the ability of non-farmers to produce spores falls off rapidly with an increase in the percentage of farmers and their defensive symbionts. Conversely, farmer spore production is unaffected by the frequency of non-farmers. Our results suggest that successful farming is a complex evolutionary adaptation because it requires additional strategies, such as recruiting third parties, to effectively defend and privatize crops.

### Establishing African genomics and bioinformatics programs through annual regional workshops [^cd46c107]. Nature Genetics (2024). High credibility.

The African BioGenome Project (AfricaBP) Open Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics aims to overcome barriers to capacity building through its distributed African regional workshops and prioritizes the exchange of grassroots knowledge and innovation in biodiversity genomics and bioinformatics. In 2023, we implemented 28 workshops on biodiversity genomics and bioinformatics, covering 11 African countries across the 5 African geographical regions. These regional workshops trained 408 African scientists in hands-on molecular biology, genomics and bioinformatics techniques as well as the ethical, legal and social issues associated with acquiring genetic resources. Here, we discuss the implementation of transformative strategies, such as expanding the regional workshop model of AfricaBP to involve multiple countries, institutions and partners, including the proposed creation of an African digital database with sequence information relating to both biodiversity and agriculture. This will ultimately help create a critical mass of skilled genomics and bioinformatics scientists across Africa.

### Wheat and maize flour fortification: practical recommendations for national application [^462acc1f]. CDC (2008). Medium credibility.

Background — global guidance and potential impact — The World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization "published in 2006 the Guidelines on Food Fortification with Micronutrients (WHO/FAO, 2006)". Fortification of widely consumed foods "has the potential to improve nutritional status of a large proportion of the population, and neither requires changes in dietary patterns nor individual decision for compliance", and when appropriately implemented "is an effective, simple, and inexpensive strategy" to supply vitamins and minerals. Worldwide production is substantial: "more than 600 million metric tons of wheat and maize flour are milled annually", and current industrial-scale wheat flour fortification coverage is regionally heterogeneous: "97% in the Americas, 31% in Africa, 44% in Eastern Mediterranean, 21% in South-East Asia, 6% in Europe, and 4% in the Western Pacific regions in 2007 (FFI, 2008)".

### Increase in African dust flux at the onset of commercial agriculture in the sahel region [^8d61f719]. Nature (2010). Excellent credibility.

The Sahara Desert is the largest source of mineral dust in the world. Emissions of African dust increased sharply in the early 1970s (ref. 2), a change that has been attributed mainly to drought in the Sahara/Sahel region caused by changes in the global distribution of sea surface temperature. The human contribution to land degradation and dust mobilization in this region remains poorly understood, owing to the paucity of data that would allow the identification of long-term trends in desertification. Direct measurements of airborne African dust concentrations only became available in the mid-1960s from a station on Barbados and subsequently from satellite imagery since the late 1970s: they do not cover the onset of commercial agriculture in the Sahel region approximately 170 years ago. Here we construct a 3,200-year record of dust deposition off northwest Africa by investigating the chemistry and grain-size distribution of terrigenous sediments deposited at a marine site located directly under the West African dust plume. With the help of our dust record and a proxy record for West African precipitation we find that, on the century scale, dust deposition is related to precipitation in tropical West Africa until the seventeenth century. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, a sharp increase in dust deposition parallels the advent of commercial agriculture in the Sahel region. Our findings suggest that human-induced dust emissions from the Sahel region have contributed to the atmospheric dust load for about 200 years.

### Impact of small farmers' access to improved seeds and deforestation in DR Congo [^09a95a00]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

An important contribution of the study is to demonstrate the value of distinguishing between primary and secondary forest deforestation. The distinction both reflects decision-making at the household level and has major ramifications for biodiversity. Tropical forests support at least two-thirds of the world's biodiversityon less than 10% of Earth's land surface. Primary forest, in particular, is critical for maintaining much of the world's biodiversity –. Species abundance and uniqueness are often much lower in secondary than in primary forest. And while ecosystem service provision and ecosystem recovery in secondary forest is an active area of research, it is well recognized that primary forest provide specific habitat types and characteristics that are not present in secondary forest. Many species are dependent on these unique properties and cannot survive without it. Hence deforestation of primary forest leads to irreversible losses in biodiversity.

Distinguishing between deforestation from primary and secondary forest hence is key to understanding the environmental trade-offs involved with agricultural intensification practices. While modern crop varieties have a large potential to improve livelihoods, the tension with possible negative effects on environmental outcomes needs to be considered in nuanced and context-specific ways. Our results show that improving access to modern cereal varieties in the Congo Basin, in the absence of accompanying policies to improve soil fertility management, may have a high cost for biodiversity due to its effects on the primary forest.

The distinction between forest types can also be important for understanding the carbon sequestration implications of deforestation. While secondary forest can sequester atmospheric CO₂ 10–20 times faster than primary forest, there is also large heterogeneity in carbon sequestration in secondary forest, as it varies with the age of the secondary forest, land-use history, number of times cleared, soil fertility, forest type, fragmentation, etc. In specific instances, average carbon in the secondary forest can be much lower than in primary forest. Overall, the trade-offs in terms of carbon sequestration deserve further research.

### Enhancing the crops to feed the poor [^79eb5989]. Nature (2002). Excellent credibility.

Solutions to the problem of how the developing world will meet its future food needs are broader than producing more food, although the successes of the 'Green Revolution' demonstrate the importance of technology in generating the growth in food output in the past. Despite these successes, the world still faces continuing vulnerability to food shortages. Given the necessary funding, it seems likely that conventional crop breeding, as well as emerging technologies based on molecular biology, genetic engineering and natural resource management, will continue to improve productivity in the coming decades.

### Genome-wide association study and pathway-level analysis of kernel color in maize [^d05a213a]. G3 (2019). Medium credibility.

Malnutrition, or hidden hunger, remains a serious issue, even as increased agricultural productivity has helped to provide more energy and calories on a global scale. As much as half of the world's population may be deficient in one or more micronutrients, with 125–130 million pre-school children and 7 million pregnant women suffering from vitamin A deficiency (VAD). Biofortification, the improvement of crop nutritional quality through breeding and/or agronomics, has been proposed as a sustainable tool to help with addressing micronutrient malnutrition, and has been found to be cost-effective. Improvement of provitamin A carotenoid levels is generally a promising target, given that naturally occurring yellow and orange-pigmented accessions have been identified for many commonly white-pigmented, starchy staple foods such as maize, cassava, banana, and sweet potato.

For biofortification to be effective, micronutrient densities must reach levels that impact human health, and the varieties and final food products must be acceptable to growers and consumers. Through decades of technical and broader contextual work, the international breeding organizations of CIMMYT, IITA and HarvestPlus, and partners have achieved the successful development of provitamin A-dense maize varieties, nearing target nutrient levels, which also have local and regional adaptation and relevance. Specifically, there has been a need to develop maize with distinctly orange kernel color for enhanced product recognition and enhanced consumer acceptance, including in certain sub-Saharan African nations where white maize is preferred but outreach and educational initiatives have successfully linked enhanced nutritional properties to the novel orange color (reviewed in). For the consistent and facilitated development of biofortified, provitamin A-dense maize varieties that meet target nutrient levels and also have strongly orange endosperm, it is important to identify and dissect the genetic loci underlying kernel color, including as relates to carotenoid content and composition. Relatedly, genetic loci showing consistent associations with darker orange color could in turn be targets for marker-assisted selection (MAS), in parallel with selection for provitamin A levels and improved or maintained agronomic performance.

### Managing nitrogen for sustainable development [^6fe622da]. Nature (2015). Excellent credibility.

Improvements in nitrogen use efficiency in crop production are critical for addressing the triple challenges of food security, environmental degradation and climate change. Such improvements are conditional not only on technological innovation, but also on socio-economic factors that are at present poorly understood. Here we examine historical patterns of agricultural nitrogen-use efficiency and find a broad range of national approaches to agricultural development and related pollution. We analyse examples of nitrogen use and propose targets, by geographic region and crop type, to meet the 2050 global food demand projected by the Food and Agriculture Organization while also meeting the Sustainable Development Goals pertaining to agriculture recently adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. Furthermore, we discuss socio-economic policies and technological innovations that may help achieve them.

### Impact of small farmers' access to improved seeds and deforestation in DR Congo [^0aedba29]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Plot-level data on conversion decisions come from a household survey collected 1.5 years after the voucher distribution (July 2014), after planting for the main season was completed. A second wave of data was collected after the harvest between November 2014 and March 2015. This is the main source of plot-level data used in the analysis, as its timing allows us to fully capture the impact of modern seed varieties on households' conversion decisions. The household head (often a man in this context) was asked for detailed information about all the plots the household cultivated in the main season of 2014, including crop use, prior use of the plot, the period of fallow, planting and harvesting dates, tenure, etc. A separate module asked for recall data, for each plot, on agricultural labor for all main agricultural activities (clearing, land preparation, sowing, weeding, and harvesting), separately for men and women in the household, estimating both the number of people and the hours worked to obtain an estimate of total man-days. The module similarly asked for any hired labor and participation in labor exchanges. Data on agricultural wage labor income by household members come from an income module with all household members. Household surveys are further described in the Supplementary Methods and Supplementary notes. Quantitative data collection and questionnaire design was preceded by extensive qualitative interviews and piloting before each wave. Qualitative fieldwork was also used to deepen understanding of farmers' land conversion decisions and to triangulate findings.

Sample selection for the surveys was based on village census and administrative data from the voucher distribution. In each of the treatment villages, we randomly drew two beneficiaries assigned the 30, 60, and 90% subsidy and three beneficiaries assigned the 100% subsidy for a total of 9 households per treatment village. The sample selection was stratified based on the households' membership in producer organizations, on having a leadership position in the village, and on polygyny. In each control village, 12 households were randomly selected based on the same stratification criteria.

From the household data, we can exploit differences in subsidy levels at the household level to measure forest conversion decisions at a granular (plot)-level and to distinguish between primary and secondary forest. We further rely on households' labor allocation for field preparation as an indirect measure of deforestation. Given the limited supply of labor at peak demand times in the study area and the labor intensity of tree cover removal, changes in land use decisions should translate into labor reallocation at the household level.

Our study takes place in the former Equateur province, as defined before the 2015 administrative reform. Specifically, the study area covers Nord Ubangi, Sud-Ubangi, and Mongala, which were part of the Equateur province in 2015 and are now defined as three separate provinces. We refer to the Equateur province in the rest of the article, corresponding to the denomination at the time of data collection.

The Equateur province is a remote forested region, part of the broader Congo Basin forest, with high levels of food insecurity and poverty. Households in the province derive most of their income from small-scale subsistence agriculture through shifting cultivation of staples, complemented by the gathering of forest products, fishing, and hunting. The agricultural potential of the region is believed to be large, but productivity is very low, partly due to remoteness and lack of access to modern technologies. Smallholders generally use a limited range of inputs, including handheld tools and low-yielding local seed varieties. The availability of chemical fertilizers is very limited in the region, as are other soil fertility management practices other than the fallowing. And as the agro-climatological conditions are not conducive for large livestock (disease-prone humid forest environment), manure use is limited. Households rely mostly on family labor, and labor availability is constrained in periods of peak labor demand (preparation, planting, and harvesting). Commercialization is hampered by very low road density, poor road quality, and long distances to markets.

### Guidelines for foodborne disease outbreak response. 2nd ed [^171dfde3]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

Changes in food production and preparation — Food can be contaminated anywhere along the supply chain from farm to fork, and the demand for processed and ready-to-eat foods has led to industrialization of food production with concentrated animal feeding operations, increasingly intense agricultural practices, and broadening distribution of food products; changes in agricultural, processing, or packaging methods might facilitate bacterial contamination or growth, use of antibiotics in livestock and poultry most likely has contributed to increased human infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria, and broadening distribution has contributed to outbreaks involving larger numbers of people, multiple states, and even multiple countries.

### Impact of small farmers' access to improved seeds and deforestation in DR Congo [^9f6b595b]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Since the 1960s, the increased availability of modern seed varieties in developing countries has had large positive effects on households' well-being. However, the effect of related land use changes on deforestation and biodiversity is ambiguous. This study examines this question through a randomized control trial in a remote area in the Congo Basin rainforest with weak input and output markets. Using plot-level data on land conversion combined with remote sensing data, we find that promotion of modern seed varieties did not lead to an increase in overall deforestation by small farmers. However, farmers cleared more primary forest and less secondary forest. We attribute this to the increased demand for nitrogen required by the use of some modern seed varieties, and to the lack of alternative sources of soil nutrients, which induced farmers to shift towards cultivation of land cleared in primary forest. Unless combined with interventions to maintain soil fertility, policies to promote modern seed varieties may come at the cost of important losses in biodiversity.

The context is further characterized by relative land abundance and the informality of the tenure system. When there is still primary forest within the village boundaries, access to it is allocated by village leaders, clan leaders, or family chiefs, depending on the prevailing allocation system. Once a household has cleared a primary forest plot, a long-term right to cultivate that plot is generally established. That said, there is considerable heterogeneity in the institutional structure of land allocation across villages as a result of inconsistent local agricultural policies, often dating back to the colonial regime.

Farmers practice slash-and-burn cultivation and, therefore, regularly open new fields in the forest. This process requires labor-intensive land preparation. First, trees and woody plants are cut down, and the vegetation is left to dry. Then, before the beginning of the rainy season, the biomass is burnt to create a layer of nutrient-rich ash and eliminate pests and weeds. Farmers typically cultivate several plots during the main agricultural season (average plot size: 0.6 hectares, average number of plots: 4.4). Some of those plots are on land that was already under cultivation the year before, while others require clearing of primary or secondary forest or overgrown fallow land. Household decisions regarding which fields to cultivate take place during the dry season preceding the main rainy season. Qualitative interviews conducted as part of the study's fieldwork revealed that farmers are keenly aware of the soil fertility implications of those decisions. There is also a short agricultural season from August to November, during which only part of the farmers cultivate, but as it is uncommon to open new fields in the forest for the short agricultural season, we concentrate on the main season.

### Pearl millet genomic vulnerability to climate change in west Africa highlights the need for regional collaboration [^a1f68ca3]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Climate change is already affecting agro-ecosystems and threatening food security by reducing crop productivity and increasing harvest uncertainty. Mobilizing crop diversity could be an efficient way to mitigate its impact. We test this hypothesis in pearl millet, a nutritious staple cereal cultivated in arid and low-fertility soils in sub-Saharan Africa. We analyze the genomic diversity of 173 landraces collected in West Africa together with an extensive climate dataset composed of metrics of agronomic importance. Mapping the pearl millet genomic vulnerability at the 2050 horizon based on the current genomic-climate relationships, we identify the northern edge of the current areas of cultivation of both early and late flowering varieties as being the most vulnerable to climate change. We predict that the most vulnerable areas will benefit from using landraces that already grow in equivalent climate conditions today. However, such seed-exchange scenarios will require long distance and trans-frontier assisted migrations. Leveraging genetic diversity as a climate mitigation strategy in West Africa will thus require regional collaboration.

### Impact of small farmers' access to improved seeds and deforestation in DR Congo [^159833fe]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Consistent with the increased allocation of labor to households farms and labor sharing, we find a decrease in household members' agricultural wage income (i.e. from wage labor outside the household farm) in the treatment groups, though it is not significant (P -value for a test of joint significance 0.25; first bar cluster of Fig. 5). A likely interpretation is that the promotion of modern seed varieties increased the economic returns of family labor for forest clearing, and therefore led to a reallocation of family labor toward this task. However, given the relative isolation of the labor market, there is not enough labor available to meet the increased demand for agricultural expansion and land clearing. This could explain why there is no overall increase in deforestation at the village level (see Fig. 3). Hence the labor data broadly support the overall findings. Because the data does not cover large commercial farms or plantations, we are, however, not able to assess the broader implications for the agricultural labor market and for land use in the commercial sector.

### A soft selective sweep during rapid evolution of gentle behaviour in an africanized honeybee [^bd0dedce]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

It is also noteworthy that gentle honeybees that are genetically distinct from the extant EHB populations can evolve rapidly from a small founder population of AHB. This is an important result as EHB in particular are principal pollinators of many domesticated plant species, but they are under threat from multiple sources, endangering production of many important agricultural and horticultural crops. Genetically diverse gentle honeybees could help secure agricultural production by providing pollinators more resistant to threats such as parasites and diseases. The evolution of gAHB also provides a paradigm for the adaptation of social organisms to new environments. The ability of eusocial insects to generate and maintain diversity within a colony at loci mechanistically involved with complex traits such as behaviour may be a key to their evolutionary success.

### Reimagining nutrition education for pregnant adolescents in the face of climate change: a community approach [^b35eabd7]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2024). High credibility.

Skill development and collaborative support to improve access to food

Access to food in our study was affected both directly and indirectly by climate change: prolonged droughts and unpredicted rainfall had affected production from kitchen gardens and livestock directly, reducing overall calorie consumption as well as consumption of healthy foods, such as vegetables, fruits and animal-source foods. In Kenya, reduced precipitation in the southern areas, including Kilifi County, has negatively impacted the agricultural sector, which relies heavily on rain-fed food production. Reduced rainfall also affects crop production indirectly by reducing pasture, which forces livestock and sometimes even wild animals from local nature reserves, to feed on the kitchen gardens. Access to food was also indirectly affected due to livestock diseases and the loss of income generated from meat and dairy products. Climate change is known to make livestock susceptible to diseases as they suffer from heat stress and altered disease-causing pathogens. The implications of these consequences are significant, particularly in areas already vulnerable to food insecurity, as climate projections for Kenya show a rise between 1 and 4°C in average annual temperature in the decades to come.

Nutrition education can play a crucial role in facilitating skill development in the community and mobilising resources in order to improve access to food. As suggested by the community, future efforts should focus on teaching young adolescents practical skills for farming, reserving water and treating livestock diseases. A recent study done among resource-poor Giriama farmers in South East Kenya showed that water conservation structures such as retention ditches and Zai-pits (small basins in which the seeds are planted) were well accepted by the community. Challenges, such as the high cost of labour for the establishment of such structures, could be faced by local support from the village leader. In many African countries, trust in community leaders is much higher than in elected government officials or donor organisations, which potentially facilitates effective leadership and establishing collaboration in the community to put up water structures or share essential nutrients. Support from the agricultural ministry through agricultural extension officers would be helpful to educate the community on treating livestock diseases and to provide pesticides and fertilisers.

Our antibiotic weapons were central to founding our modern medicine, agriculture and military, and modernisation of our very form of life through helping us: shift our hygiene practices in hospitals and farms; increase our — demands for — efficiency, speed and scale of animal production and medical practices; empower our (im)patients, freeing us from illness and dispelling our dis-ease; reduce our need and calls for convalesce; increase modern pharmaceuticals' and other industries' profits and ensure we emerged victorious in our wars. All that was required was for us to pop the right pill. So, we developed and marketed a range of tailored antibiotic weaponry to target different aspects of our daily battles for germ-free bodies and environments, including: soaps, detergents, toothpastes, livestock feed and even attempts at germ-eradicating sweets (candettes), ice-cream and lipstick. As antibiotic wars came to be infrastructural to almost every aspect of our daily lives, some of us went as far as to prophesise that the time was approaching when our bacterial invaders would become a matter of our past, and our dream of a well-ordered, rational and enlightened society free of germs would finally become our reality.

### Alternative protein sources: science powered startups to fuel food innovation [^ce0b89fa]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

In 2022 almost 735 million people, 9.2% of the global population, were undernourishedand as we are entering the second quarter of this century, the world faces a formidable task of feeding a growing population projected to reach 10 billion by 2050. It is further aggravated by substantial food losses due to climate change and crop diseases. To address this task requires a 50% increase in global food production in the next 25 yearsand the significance of food innovation becoming increasingly evident in order to create solutions tackling the urgency and scale of this food security challenge.

The World Resources Report 'Creating a Sustainable Food Future'identified 22 solutions to address this need, which were grouped into five categories: (1) reduction of growth in demand for food and other agricultural products; (2) increase in food production without expanding agricultural land; (3) protection and restoration of natural ecosystems; (4) increase in fish supply; and (5) reduction of greenhouse gasses emissions from agricultural production. To implement these solutions, supporting the sustainable development goalsand also addressing the food security challenge, require new technologies and product innovations, i.e. it is essential to find innovative ways to produce and distribute food more efficiently and sustainably. Achieving this goal can involve developing novel farming techniques (precision agriculture), exploring alternative protein sources, or implementing smart technologies to reduce waste and optimise food supply chains.

Considerable efforts have been put in place to address this challenge ranging from precision agriculture to food innovation (Fig. 1). This involves truly cross disciplinary innovation efforts for example, genetic modifications to increase crops' resilience, different antibacterial strategies to improve food security, sensorsand big data advances for precision farming, artificial intelligence (AI) and block chain technologies to manage food supply, advancement in material science to develop functional packaging materials, tissue engineering in the development of alternative protein sourcesetc.

Multidisciplinary approaches to address food security challenge: innovation focal points.

Multidisciplinary approaches are required to effectively address the Food Security Challenge which result in innovation technologies and approaches, e.g. advancement in genetic engineering to develop high-yield and disease resistant crops; using drones and big data analytics for precision farming; expanding use of 3D bioprinting to produce non-animal based meat alternatives. Note: the diagram aims to provide an overview of innovation examples across different scientific areas rather to list all scientific fields involved in the Food Security area.

### Impact of small farmers' access to improved seeds and deforestation in DR Congo [^4eb3ef32]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

We further find that exposure to modern varieties changed the nature of deforestation. We hypothesized this is driven by an increase in demand for soil nutrients generated by modern seed varieties for cereals, which was met neither by local fertilizer markets nor the government's agricultural rehabilitation project. In the Congo Basin forest of Equateur, the absence of fertilizers and the lack of information on soil conservation practices meant that previously uncultivated land gave the highest cereal yields — a feature that local farmers are well aware of, following land-and-crop rotation recommendations introduced by agronomists during colonial times. In this setting, smallholder farmers with increased access to modern cereal varieties accelerated the clearing of the primary forest while cultivating less land converted from the secondary forest or other land uses. Exogenous variation in the type of seeds that were offered to farmers helps understand the mechanism. Where cereals were the predominant modern seed variety offered, subsidies led to an increase in the deforestation of the primary forest by beneficiary households. In contrast, modern seed variety promotion led to more limited deforestation in villages where more legumes were available for purchase, in line with the historical recommendations that legumes be planted on poorer soils given their lower need for nitrogen. This last finding comes with a caveat, as the random variation in the availability of cereals versus legumes was not planned for in the original experimental design. The increased access to legumes is found in villages where a larger proportion of treated households used their subsidies and they bought smaller quantities. We cannot fully rule out that these other differences also influenced land conversion decisions. Distinguishing farmers' soil fertility management decisions for legumes versus cereals hence deserves further research with experimental variation in exposure to different crops. Even so, the results in this study point to the importance of promoting modern seed varieties in combination with soil fertility management practices to achieve sustainable intensification, especially in contexts where smallholders use the primary forest as a source of nitrogen for improved cereals cultivation, asalso concludes.

### Future changes in the trading of virtual water [^24f0e5d3]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Fig. 2
Virtual water trade fluxes by water type, region, and crop in 2100.

a Average global virtual green water trade (billion m³), b virtual blue water trade (billion m³), and c virtual nonrenewable groundwater trade (billion m³) by crop and aggregate GCAM region in 2100 for all SSP2-RCP6.0 GCM scenarios (n = 5). Positive values represent exports while negative values imply virtual water imports.

Virtual blue water trading shows significant differences arising in China, Pakistan, India, and the Middle East as the availability of water for irrigation decreases and populations change throughout the century(Fig. 2b; Supplementary Figs. 4–7). In 2100, globally, China represents a large source of virtual water exports due to the trading of wheat and rice products (Fig. 2b). Interestingly, China shifts from importer currently, to exporter in the future, because of a reduced growth rate after 2030 that ultimately causes population to decline. Reduced domestic demands allow the use of all excess production to meet international agricultural demands. Regions in Africa experience nearly the opposite effect as population rapidly increases throughout the century, resulting in increasing demand that is unmet by domestic production (Supplementary Fig. 3). The United States represents another main source of future virtual blue exports through corn, fibers, and oil crops, with a corresponding import of only miscellaneous crops (MiscCrops, e.g. fruits, vegetables, nuts), as part of the southwestern United States shifts production away from MiscCrops toward the end of the century. Finally, we have found an intensification of VWT in the early part of the century as population growth continues and exports originate from water-intensive regions of the Middle East, Pakistan, and India, while toward the end of the century, exports come from water-rich areas that require smaller amounts of water to grow (Supplementary Fig. 2). This shifting of global food production accounts for demand changes, water scarcity changes, and groundwater depletion that together result in an inability to meet demands from domestic production alone, consistent with previous studies.

### Agricultural subsidies and global greenhouse gas emissions [^cbfeb182]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Support intended to influence production practices and processes, such as subsidies on fertilizers, pesticides, or improved seeds, also matter. In practice, these mostly aim to stimulate agricultural production which may induce more emissions unless improved practices are more resource efficient. Higher use of inputs such as fertilizer may be an additional source of GHG emissions though improved, climate-resilient seeds may help improve environmental outcomes. Some support programs, like the reformed Common Agricultural Policy of the EU, condition support on compliance with environment-friendly production processes and land conservation practices.

The OECD's GSS estimate includes support for activities such as agricultural research, development, and training intended to raise agricultural productivity. Productivity gains tend to reduce the emission intensity of agricultural production, for instance, through reduced use of intermediate inputs. Some new technologies appear able to both reduce emission intensities and lower costs (see, for example, Mernit).

This article focuses on the implications of current agricultural support policies for GHG emissions. It applies a rigorous model-based analysis of the impacts of incentives on agricultural outputs and emissions. This analysis provides an opportunity to consider all the influences outlined above — impacts on overall output, differences in incentives across countries and commodities, as well as differences in farm technologies and practices used for production. It also allows us to examine the extent and potential implications of environmental conditionalities incorporated in producer support measures. We consider not just the total emissions per unit of output, but also the source of those emissions — whether they are, for instance, from enteric fermentation by ruminants or methane emissions from rice cultivation.

### Breeding future crops to feed the world through de novo domestication [^c1f3ed0e]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

New challenges lead to the shift of breeding objectives

After the Industrial Revolution, crop breeding objectives were greatly changed. Crops were supplied or managed with a large amount of fossil-fueled products, including fertilizer and pesticide, freshwater from irrigation systems, and farm machinery. Thus, the breeding objectives were shifted to develop high-yield varieties to adapt to new farming systems. One example was the Green Revolution, which was represented by the development of semi-dwarf wheat and rice varieties that were capable of responding to fertilizer and irrigation without lodging. Between 1950 and 1984, as the Green Revolution updated the global agriculture system, world grain production increased by 250%, but the energy input increased by ~50 times.

However, future agriculture is still facing great challenges. First, the world population is estimated to reach 10–12 billion by the end of this century, requiring at least 50% increase in total food productivity, but the use of fossil fuel is likely to be greatly restricted before that. Second, the world is facing a rapid climate change and more frequent extreme weather conditions, which have become major threatens to agriculture. What are the new strategies to further increase crop yield? How to create crops that are highly resistant to extreme weather conditions and capable of rapid adaptation to climate changes? Answers to these questions are urgently needed.

### Guidelines for foodborne disease outbreak response. 2nd ed [^893880d8]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

Changes in food production and preparation — Changes in food-production technology and improved growing, harvesting, packaging, and transportation practices contribute to trends in foodborne disease, with industrialization leading to concentrated animal feeding operations and increasingly intense agricultural practices that can facilitate spread of disease and contamination of food products; changes in agricultural processing or packaging can facilitate bacterial contamination or growth, and routine use of antibiotics to promote the growth of livestock and poultry most likely has contributed to increased human infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria; broadening distribution of foods has contributed to outbreaks of foodborne disease involving larger numbers of people, multiple states, and even multiple countries; recent interest in eating locally produced foods has resulted in increased numbers of small food producers and direct-to-consumer marketing, and although the effect on foodborne disease trends is yet to be determined, implementation of improved food-safety measures could be more challenging among more widespread smaller food producers, many of which are exempted from food-safety regulations that pertain to other retail food establishments.

Results

Historical LULCC since the industrial revolution

Figure 1 shows the global historical LULCC from 1850 to 2014 based on the Land-Use Harmonization 2 (LUH2) dataset, which is the land-use forcing for the CMIP6 "historical" experiment (see Methods). The global fractional coverage of primary vegetation (including forest and non-forest) in 2014 was reduced by 89.2% relative to that in 1850, while secondary vegetation, cropland, grazing land, and urban land exhibited increases of 81.2%, 172.6%, 176.9%, and 1349.5%, respectively (Fig. 1a). Humans have disturbed a majority of primary vegetation globally (Fig. 2). Secondary vegetation showed significant increases over mid-latitude Eurasia and the eastern USA. Cropland expansion was mainly distributed around the Great Lakes of North America, south of the Amazon, central Africa, north of the Caspian Sea, and India. The expansion of grazing land was more significant, mainly located in the USA, south of the Amazon, central and southern Africa, central Asia, and Australia. Although the area of urban land is smaller than the other four types of land cover, its relative change was the largest, mainly over the eastern USA, Europe, and China.

### COP27 climate change conference: urgent action needed for Africa and the world [^0d9371f5]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2022). High credibility.

The damage to Africa should be of supreme concern to all nations. This is partly for moral reasons. It is highly unjust that the most impacted nations have contributed the least to global cumulative emissions, which are driving the climate crisis and its increasingly severe effects. North America and Europe have contributed 62% of carbon dioxide emissions since the Industrial Revolution, whereas Africa has contributed only 3%.

Yet it is not just for moral reasons that all nations should be concerned for Africa. The fight against the climate crisis needs all hands on deck. The acute and chronic impacts of the climate crisis create problems such as poverty, infectious disease, forced migration, and conflict that spread through globalised systems. These knock-on impacts affect all nations. COVID-19 served as a wake-up call to these global dynamics and it is no coincidence that health professionals have been active in identifying and responding to the consequences of growing systemic risks to health. But the lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic should not be limited to pandemic risk. Instead, it is imperative that the suffering of front-line nations, including those in Africa, be the core consideration at COP27; in an interconnected world, leaving countries to the mercy of environmental shocks creates instability that has severe consequences for all nations.

The primary focus of climate summits remains to rapidly reduce emissions so that global temperature rises are kept to below 1.5.ß.C. This will limit the harm. But, for Africa and other vulnerable regions, this harm is already severe. Achieving the promised target of providing US$100 billion of climate finance a year is now globally critical if we are to forestall the systemic risks of leaving societies in crisis. This can be done by ensuring these resources focus on increasing resilience to the existing and inevitable future impacts of the climate crisis, as well as on supporting vulnerable nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions: a parity of esteem between adaptation and mitigation. These resources should come through grants not loans, and be urgently scaled up before the current review period of 2025. They must put health-system resilience at the forefront, as the compounding crises caused by the climate crisis often manifest in acute health problems. Financing adaptation will be more cost-effective than relying on disaster relief.

### Deforestation reduces rainfall and agricultural revenues in the Brazilian amazon [^ce96993c]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Anticipating the impacts of deforestation on the region's ecosystem services, especially rainfall regulation for agriculture, is paramount to convince policymakers and other stakeholders to act before it is too late. Indeed, acknowledging those risks could help steer Brazil back to a course that sustainably integrates agricultural production and environmental conservation. Brazil's agribusiness and their global partners are testing the limits of nature by expanding into natural forests at the risk of reducing the rainfall that sustains its productivity. The current land-use trajectory in the Brazilian Amazon, therefore, puts the largely rainfed agricultural systems of the country on an unsustainable pathway.

### Closing yield gaps through nutrient and water management [^bc3c656e]. Nature (2012). Excellent credibility.

In the coming decades, a crucial challenge for humanity will be meeting future food demands without undermining further the integrity of the Earth's environmental systems. Agricultural systems are already major forces of global environmental degradation, but population growth and increasing consumption of calorie- and meat-intensive diets are expected to roughly double human food demand by 2050 (ref. 3). Responding to these pressures, there is increasing focus on 'sustainable intensification' as a means to increase yields on underperforming landscapes while simultaneously decreasing the environmental impacts of agricultural systems. However, it is unclear what such efforts might entail for the future of global agricultural landscapes. Here we present a global-scale assessment of intensification prospects from closing 'yield gaps' (differences between observed yields and those attainable in a given region), the spatial patterns of agricultural management practices and yield limitation, and the management changes that may be necessary to achieve increased yields. We find that global yield variability is heavily controlled by fertilizer use, irrigation and climate. Large production increases (45% to 70% for most crops) are possible from closing yield gaps to 100% of attainable yields, and the changes to management practices that are needed to close yield gaps vary considerably by region and current intensity. Furthermore, we find that there are large opportunities to reduce the environmental impact of agriculture by eliminating nutrient overuse, while still allowing an approximately 30% increase in production of major cereals (maize, wheat and rice). Meeting the food security and sustainability challenges of the coming decades is possible, but will require considerable changes in nutrient and water management.

### Unveiling African rainforest composition and vulnerability to global change [^247cbab8]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

Africa is forecasted to experience large and rapid climate change 1 and population growth 2 during the twenty-first century, which threatens the world's second largest rainforest. Protecting and sustainably managing these African forests requires an increased understanding of their compositional heterogeneity, the environmental drivers of forest composition and their vulnerability to ongoing changes. Here, using a very large dataset of 6 million trees in more than 180,000 field plots, we jointly model the distribution in abundance of the most dominant tree taxa in central Africa, and produce continuous maps of the floristic and functional composition of central African forests. Our results show that the uncertainty in taxon-specific distributions averages out at the community level, and reveal highly deterministic assemblages. We uncover contrasting floristic and functional compositions across climates, soil types and anthropogenic gradients, with functional convergence among types of forest that are floristically dissimilar. Combining these spatial predictions with scenarios of climatic and anthropogenic global change suggests a high vulnerability of the northern and southern forest margins, the Atlantic forests and most forests in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where both climate and anthropogenic threats are expected to increase sharply by 2085. These results constitute key quantitative benchmarks for scientists and policymakers to shape transnational conservation and management strategies that aim to provide a sustainable future for central African forests.

### Ancient DNA and deep population structure in sub-saharan African foragers [^8646e5e8]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

Multiple lines of genetic and archaeological evidence suggest that there were major demographic changes in the terminal Late Pleistocene epoch and early Holocene epoch of sub-Saharan Africa 1–4. Inferences about this period are challenging to make because demographic shifts in the past 5,000 years have obscured the structures of more ancient populations 3,5. Here we present genome-wide ancient DNA data for six individuals from eastern and south-central Africa spanning the past approximately 18,000 years (doubling the time depth of sub-Saharan African ancient DNA), increase the data quality for 15 previously published ancient individuals and analyse these alongside data from 13 other published ancient individuals. The ancestry of the individuals in our study area can be modelled as a geographically structured mixture of three highly divergent source populations, probably reflecting Pleistocene interactions around 80–20 thousand years ago, including deeply diverged eastern and southern African lineages, plus a previously unappreciated ubiquitous distribution of ancestry that occurs in highest proportion today in central African rainforest hunter-gatherers. Once established, this structure remained highly stable, with limited long-range gene flow. These results provide a new line of genetic evidence in support of hypotheses that have emerged from archaeological analyses but remain contested, suggesting increasing regionalization at the end of the Pleistocene epoch.

Results

Overview

The Industrial Revolution ushered in an era of growing GDP, energy use and GHGe, all of which expanded towards unprecedented levels (Fig. 1a). While the overall trajectory of these variables is somewhat similar in the long run, if we look more closely their historical paths differ at crucial junctures (Fig. 1b). During the nineteenth century and until the First World War, global GDP and emissions were very much "coupled": they grew at a similar yearly cumulative rate (~1.4%). In other words, the carbon intensity of the global economy, i.e. GHGe per unit of GDP, remained relatively stable (Supplementary Fig. 1a). During the interwar period, between 1914 and 1945, we can see the first global decoupling between GDP and GHGe. Global economic growth maintained its pace, despite relative stagnation in the West (as referred to in the historical regions of the Maddison Project), while emissions slowed down, mainly because the largest emitters (i.e. Western countries, Supplementary Fig. 2) reduced their fossil-fuel emissions. In the decades following the Second World War, both economic growth and emissions accelerated dramatically. Economic historians refer to this period as the "golden age of (Western) economic growth", while in the environmental literature, it is known as the era of the "great acceleration" of resource use and environmental impacts. In this context, the global economy grew significantly faster than emissions (3.8% compared to 2.3%), resulting in decades of relative decoupling, as the carbon intensity of the economy fell substantially. Since 1990, both economic growth and emissions slowed down relative to the post-war era, although their rate of growth remains above pre-Second World War trends. Emissions have slowed down to a larger extent than GDP, and so the carbon intensity of the global economy has decreased at an unprecedented pace (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Relative decoupling persisted, as GDP continued to grow faster than emissions, but much like in the preceding periods, there was no evidence of absolute decoupling at the global level.

Discussion

Can we sustain economic growth and at the same time reduce its environmental impacts to keep humanity within a "safe operating space?" This question, one of the most important for our collective future, still lacks a consensus answer. Our results can inform that debate in the following ways.

First, historical data chart our direction of travel. Continuing to expand output while reducing absolute emission levels requires that we drastically reduce the carbon intensity of the global economy (i.e. GHGe per unit of GDP), and, additionally, that rising economic activity (encouraged by these efficiency gains) does not result in a decrease in absolute emissions — thus avoiding the "rebound effect". Does history suggest we are moving in that direction? During the first century and a half following the Industrial Revolution and its initial spread in the West, global economic output, resource use, and emissions were coupled and grew at roughly the same pace. This means that, at the global scale, technological change did not result in a significant fall in emissions per unit of GDP, except (partially) during the interwar years. Some countries were already experiencing instances of decoupling throughout the nineteenth century, although these were mostly explained by the slowing down of deforestation processes rather than by substantial emission-mitigating technological change. It was only after World War II that a more generalized pattern of relative decoupling emerged. New technologies and their global diffusion, as well as service-oriented structural change in advanced economies, substantially reduced the energy required per unit of output –. Furthermore, the transition from coal to oil and gas, and more recently towards renewable energy sources, reduced the GHG emitted per unit of energy, thus decoupling (to an extent) emissions from energy use.

### Assessing the efficiency of changes in land use for mitigating climate change [^6cfc2049]. Nature (2018). Excellent credibility.

Land-use changes are critical for climate policy because native vegetation and soils store abundant carbon and their losses from agricultural expansion, together with emissions from agricultural production, contribute about 20 to 25 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions 1,2. Most climate strategies require maintaining or increasing land-based carbon 3 while meeting food demands, which are expected to grow by more than 50 per cent by 2050 1,2,4. A finite global land area implies that fulfilling these strategies requires increasing global land-use efficiency of both storing carbon and producing food. Yet measuring the efficiency of land-use changes from the perspective of greenhouse gas emissions is challenging, particularly when land outputs change, for example, from one food to another or from food to carbon storage in forests. Intuitively, if a hectare of land produces maize well and forest poorly, maize should be the more efficient use of land, and vice versa. However, quantifying this difference and the yields at which the balance changes requires a common metric that factors in different outputs, emissions from different agricultural inputs (such as fertilizer) and the different productive potentials of land due to physical factors such as rainfall or soils. Here we propose a carbon benefits index that measures how changes in the output types, output quantities and production processes of a hectare of land contribute to the global capacity to store carbon and to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions. This index does not evaluate biodiversity or other ecosystem values, which must be analysed separately. We apply the index to a range of land-use and consumption choices relevant to climate policy, such as reforesting pastures, biofuel production and diet changes. We find that these choices can have much greater implications for the climate than previously understood because standard methods for evaluating the effects of land use 4–11 on greenhouse gas emissions systematically underestimate the opportunity of land to store carbon if it is not used for agriculture.

### Carbon pricing drives critical transition to green growth [^37e09110]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Second, we show that carbon pricing is not a blanket policy that will be successful everywhere. In countries that lack the potential for renewable energy, raising the CP would represent a blanket tax on energy and may not drive the economy to a low-carbon regime(Fig. 4 b). Phasing out coal power plants, the single largest source of global greenhouse gas emissions (20%), is another major challenge as retiring or re-purposing them requires large amounts of private investment and public support. Meanwhile, the behavior of private investment is increasingly influenced by ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) standards. This trend prompts a growing number of investment funds and other stakeholders to prioritize sustainability. In the longer term, a careful balance is needed to redirect how existing infrastructure could be used without going so far as to incentivize building new infrastructure and avoidable carbon lock-in. The potential for rapid and material global emissions reductions appears to have gone unnoticed thus far; it is about time that the benefits of fuel switching received greater attention.

### Promoting and implementing the mediterranean diet in the Southern hemisphere: the Chilean experience [^7924d250]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Increasing scientific evidence shows that the Mediterranean lifestyle -including a characteristic dietary pattern as well as psychosocial and cultural features- has beneficial effects on human health. However, production and use of some of the distinctive components (e.g., olive oil, red wine, nuts, legumes, fish and seafood) of the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) are not exclusively confined to the Mediterranean Basin, but are also found in other world regions, including California, Southwestern Australia, South Africa, and Chile. Central Chile exhibits a Mediterranean climate and Chilean agriculture and culinary traditions show striking similarities to Mediterranean countries. Using a MedDiet index adapted to food habits in Chile, we found that only 10% of the adult population displays this healthy eating behavior. Furthermore, high scores in the MedDiet index correlate with lower prevalence of overweight, obesity, and metabolic syndrome in Chilean adults. High adherence to a Mediterranean-like diet is also associated with better psychological wellbeing. Finally, a pilot study investigating the effects of a Mediterranean diet in Chile -as part of a 'food-at-work intervention'- showed a significant improvement in diet quality which was associated with a 35% reduction in the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome. Increased appreciation and application of a Mediterranean-like dietary pattern may therefore improve health and quality of life in the population of Chile, where non-communicable chronic diseases are increasingly common.

### QTG-finder2: a generalized machine-learning algorithm for prioritizing QTL causal genes in plants [^b0ec1243]. G3 (2020). Medium credibility.

Improving crop production to address the rapid increase in the global food demand, combined with increasing limitations of arable land, remains a major challenge. The world population is expected to exceed 9 billion by 2050 and will require a 70% increase in global food production. Between 1985 and 2005 the world's croplands increased by only about 2.4%. Therefore, a significant increase of crop yield is required to feed the growing population, especially when there are increasing uncertainties of the changing climate.

Two common approaches used to improve crop yield and other agriculturally important traits are plant breeding and genome editing. Although plant breeding contributed significantly to crop yield improvement in the past century, it is facing obstacles such as limited sources of genetic variation and time-consuming phenotyping and germplasm evaluation. With the advancement of CRISPR/Cas9 technology, genome editing has become a much faster way to enhance crop traits and it is possible to introduce novel alleles for a single gene via targeted mutagenesis. However, genome editing will require identification of the trait-associated genes or the causal variants. Many trait-associated causal genes in quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been validated by mutational analysis and functional complementation experiments.

### Guidelines for foodborne disease outbreak response. 2nd ed [^00cc8fce]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

Foods associated with a processor/producer — control of source during foodborne disease outbreaks emphasizes coordinated regulatory action and criteria for market removal. Trace-back investigations can help identify contamination points and guide targeted environmental assessments, and early engagement with the processor/producer and the appropriate food-regulatory agency can help identify implicated products. When implicated foods might be in distribution, at retail establishments, or in the homes of consumers, the food-regulatory agency will take the lead on recall activities if it has adequate information to accurately identify the contaminated item. Contact the appropriate regulator with jurisdiction; the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates most foods while the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) regulates meat, poultry, and most out-of-shell egg products. Regulators may coordinate with manufacturers on recalls and may ask retailers to remove product and distributors to withhold distribution; recall at the processor level generally requires federal and/or state action, and in some jurisdictions local health jurisdictions will embargo food, and under the Food Safety Modernization Act, FDA can order the embargo of food for up to 30 days without a court order. Questions to ask in considering whether to remove food from the market include "Is risk to consumers ongoing?", "Is the product still on the market or in the distribution system?", and "Is the product likely to be in the homes of consumers?", and removal is justified if there is a strong epidemiologic association between illness and consumption of the food even if the pathogen has not been isolated, OR if definitive lab results show the outbreak pathogen is present in the product based on a representative, properly handled sample to avoid cross-contamination.

### Effect of increased concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide on the global threat of zinc deficiency: a modelling study [^e8e5f7c9]. The Lancet: Global Health (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Increasing concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) lower the content of zinc and other nutrients in important food crops. Zinc deficiency is currently responsible for large burdens of disease globally, and the populations who are at highest risk of zinc deficiency also receive most of their dietary zinc from crops. By modelling dietary intake of bioavailable zinc for the populations of 188 countries under both an ambient CO2 and elevated CO2 scenario, we sought to estimate the effect of anthropogenic CO2 emissions on the global risk of zinc deficiency.

Methods

We estimated per capita per day bioavailable intake of zinc for the populations of 188 countries at ambient CO2 concentrations (375–384 ppm) using food balance sheet data for 2003–07 from the Food and Agriculture Organization. We then used previously published data from free air CO2 enrichment and open-top chamber experiments to model zinc intake at elevated CO2 concentrations (550 ppm, which is the concentration expected by 2050). Estimates developed by the International Zinc Nutrition Consultative Group were used for country-specific theoretical mean daily per-capita physiological requirements for zinc. Finally, we used these data on zinc bioavailability and population-weighted estimated average zinc requirements to estimate the risk of inadequate zinc intake among the populations of the different nations under the two scenarios (ambient and elevated CO2). The difference between the population at risk at elevated and ambient CO2 concentrations (ie, population at new risk of zinc deficiency) was our measure of impact.

Findings

The total number of people estimated to be placed at new risk of zinc deficiency by 2050 was 138 million (95% CI 120–156). The people likely to be most affected live in Africa and South Asia, with nearly 48 million (32–63) residing in India alone. Global maps of increased risk show significant heterogeneity.

Interpretation

Our results indicate that one heretofore unquantified human health effect associated with anthropogenic CO2 emissions will be a significant increase in the human population at risk of zinc deficiency. Our country-specific findings can be used to help guide interventions aimed at reducing this vulnerability.

### Sustainable intensification for a larger global rice bowl [^2887d8ca]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is the main staple food for nearly half the world's population, accounting for 21% of global calorie intake while using 11% of global cropland. Rice yields have increased steadily since the onset of the Green Revolution in the late 1960s, driven by adoption of high-yielding rice cultivars, intensive use of agricultural inputs, and investments in irrigation infrastructure, extension education services, and subsidies. Global rice consumption is projected to increase from 480 million tons (Mt) milled rice in 2014 to nearly 550 Mt by 2030, driven by both population increase and economic growth in developing countries. However, there are a number of concerns about the future sustainability of rice cropping systems. First, yield growth rates have slowed down, and even reached a plateau, in some major rice-producing regions such as California (USA), China, Indonesia, and South Korea. Second, negative environmental impact is a concern because rice production consumes 30%, 14%, and 10%, respectively, of global use of irrigation water, fertilizers, and pesticides –, leading in some cases to negative environmental impacts. Furthermore, rice cultivation is an important source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, accounting for 30 and 11% of global agricultural methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O) emissions, respectively. Third, high labor requirements and other associated costs make rice production less attractive to farmers in some regions, especially where national governments are becoming reluctant to provide price support mechanisms and subsidies.

### Molecular identification of the wheat male fertility gene Ms1 and its prospects for hybrid breeding [^2569cb38]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

With the predicted growth in world population to over nine billion by 2050, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (July 2005) set a target of 60% increased food production by that year. This is an ambitious target for two reasons: there are serious concerns about the viability of existing production systems and the sustainability of current growth rates in crop production, and the predicted environmental changes are expected to have an overall negative effect on agricultural production, with serious crop declines in some countries. Wheat is grown more widely than any other crop and delivers around 20% of our food calories and protein. To increase global production by 60% will require a lift in the rates of gain from the current 1 to 1.6% per annum. Improvements in disease resistance and stress tolerance offer opportunities for small increases in productivity but major jumps in yield are hard to achieve and are expected to come through shifts in the way we breed wheat and other crops. However, many important new genetic and genomic technologies are difficult to apply to wheat since this plant has a large complex genome, an allohexaploid, which is 50 times larger than rice.

### Determinants of woody cover in African savannas [^f015394c]. Nature (2005). Excellent credibility.

Savannas are globally important ecosystems of great significance to human economies. In these biomes, which are characterized by the co-dominance of trees and grasses, woody cover is a chief determinant of ecosystem properties. The availability of resources (water, nutrients) and disturbance regimes (fire, herbivory) are thought to be important in regulating woody cover, but perceptions differ on which of these are the primary drivers of savanna structure. Here we show, using data from 854 sites across Africa, that maximum woody cover in savannas receiving a mean annual precipitation (MAP) of less than approximately 650 mm is constrained by, and increases linearly with, MAP. These arid and semi-arid savannas may be considered 'stable' systems in which water constrains woody cover and permits grasses to coexist, while fire, herbivory and soil properties interact to reduce woody cover below the MAP-controlled upper bound. Above a MAP of approximately 650 mm, savannas are 'unstable' systems in which MAP is sufficient for woody canopy closure, and disturbances (fire, herbivory) are required for the coexistence of trees and grass. These results provide insights into the nature of African savannas and suggest that future changes in precipitation may considerably affect their distribution and dynamics.

### An agricultural digital twin for mandarins demonstrates the potential for individualized agriculture [^ac27bd1d]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Digital twin for fruit quality management

The overarching goal is to increase the fruit quality, but too many factors are associated with it. As presented in this study, fruit quality significantly varies between orchards and within orchards (e.g. the Iab orchard in Fig. 8). In particular, given the regular data updates, the tree-level variations and the longitudinal patterns can be monitored for the purpose of quality control. In this sense, individualized agriculture will become a feasible agricultural system in the future. The current agricultural system, which produces high-quality products in small areas, such as greenhouses, can be expanded and applied to large areas of open fields in the future. The application of individualized agriculture is essential not only for the production of high-quality agricultural products in large areas but for multi-variety small-scale production systems as well. Recently, space agriculture has been explored in the context of space development, and the application of individualized agriculture is fundamental to produce agricultural products in a limited space.

An agricultural DT must be a shared tool for stakeholders. It requires active discussion among stakeholders, updates on a regular basis, and continuous improvements for helpful real-world feedback. For policymakers, data visualization like Fig. 2 can guide their regional decisions. Such information can be reflected in the budget of policymakers who are in charge of agricultural soils and fertilizer supply in Jeju Island. For distributors, data visualizations like Figs. 6, 7, and 8 can support inter-orchard quality assessment and tracking. If more detailed information is available than presented in this study, a DT can provide information regarding yield forecasts, expected profits, and management of distributed fruit. For researchers, data visualization like Figs. 3 and 4 can help understand regional and inter-orchard variations, generate and test hypotheses, and make practical suggestions. They can even plan matched studies by cultivar and conduct cultivar-specific studies. Finally, for farmers, Fig. 8 can help assess intra-orchard fruit quality and monitor longitudinal patterns after performing particular agricultural practices, and a DT can present detailed information at tree-level.

### Green growth in the mirror of history [^060b324f]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Beyond the formidable technical challenges involved, such a transition would need to meet the requirements of fairness. Not every country, and not every person, has contributed equally to climate change (Supplementary Fig. 3). Acknowledging the principle of "shared but differentiated responsibilities", each country's remaining fair share depends on historical cumulative emissions, and so efforts should also be diverse. Moreover, such a transition would need to take into account not just climate impacts, which are the only ones we examine in this study, but also other environmental impacts which can be equally harmful to human wellbeing.

Third, our results highlight emission reductions during economic recessions. Rather disturbingly, history tells us that emission reduction in the past owes at least as much (if not more) to recessions than to episodes of genuine green growth. Modern economic development and anthropogenic GHGe have been historically so closely intertwined that most fossil-fuel emission reduction has taken place during times of contraction rather than expansion of economic activity. Importantly, this does not imply that to save the planet we should hope for socio-economic crises: recessions reduce emissions primarily because of the conjunctural slowdown of economic activity, not because they make the structure of output or employment "greener". If they did, their impact on emissions would be sustained through time, and the data show otherwise. Instead, what the historical mirror suggests is that economic growth as we know it since industrialization is by default coupled with rising emissions. This does not entitle us to predict that the future will follow this pattern. But if genuine green growth becomes the new norm, it will enter the archives as a discontinuity in historical development.

### Improved human greenspace exposure equality during 21century urbanization [^0d5d8a19]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Prominent spatial differences in urban greenspace trends have been revealed across our sample of global cities, particularly in the contrast between cities in the Global North and Global South. Global North cities that are highly urbanized have become greener over the past two decades, the likely cause of which is more green real estate building and green urban planning and city management by both private and public developers and agencies. On the other hand, cities with lower levels of urbanization in the Global North are still experiencing vegetation cover loss (Fig. 1a). This contrast highlights the different priorities for greening management policy and action in Global North and Global South cities. Global North cities might encourage optimizing greenspace provision configuration and quality to maximize greening benefits (e.g. climate cooling), and minimize risks (e.g. pollen allergy). Global South cities may need to increase green planting programs to make up for the reduction in physical greenspace coverage. Interestingly, a turning point in the trend of greenspace provision and exposure was observed around the year 2011, when the world's urban population exceeded the rural populationand natural and anthropogenic activities plausibly related to a net global vegetation greening (e.g. CO2 fertilization, climate change, land-use change, and nitrogen deposition) have been enhanced. Prior to this, cities globally, were experiencing a decline in greenspace coverage, but after 2011, the trend reversed turning to a positive increase, indicating a net greenspace provision.

Global cities, represented by our 1028 samples experienced a net increase in exposure to greenspace during the start of this century (Fig. 1b). With the exception of cities in South America, all regions in the world, namely, cities in North American, European, African, Asian, Australian, and Oceanian, experienced increased greenspace (Table 1) over this period. Compared with greenspace coverage, greenspace exposure has changed with a larger magnitude due to greenspace-human interactions. The trend occurred through urbanization-induced vegetation loss in the outer belts of cities with a much lower populationand concurrently, greenspace coverage increases and population grows in new urban areas. Our findings show a substantial difference in greenspace exposure change rates between cities in the Global North and Global South, with cities in the Global North experiencing approximately seven times for the increase rate of greenspace exposure compared to those in the Global South (Table 1).

Indicator 2.2.3: urban greenspace — headline finding: the proportion of urban centres with moderate or higher levels of greenness decreased from 18% in 2015 to 13% in 2022 in low HDI countries, with little variation across other HDI groups

Green spaces can reduce the intensity of heat at the neighbourhood scale in urban centres, while positively affecting physical and mental health, providing local improvements in air quality, and helping reduce the risk of urban floods by reducing water runoff. – This indicator uses satellite measurements of vegetation (measured with the normalised difference vegetation index [NDVI]) overlayed with population data to estimate greenspace exposure for 1041 urban centres with over 500 000 inhabitants across 174 countries. Global urban greenness has remained low (mean NDVI = 0.34) since 2015. In very high HDI countries, 36% of urban centres had at least moderate levels of greenness, against 18% in high HDI countries, 36% in medium HDI countries, and 13% in low HDI countries. Concerningly, low HDI countries are the only HDI group to experience a reduction in exposure to moderate or higher levels of urban greenspace, with a drop from 18% in 2015 to 13% in 2022.

Indicator 2.2.4: global multilateral funding for health adaptation programmes — headline finding: $1.16 billion of Green Climate Fund (GCF) financing was dedicated to adaptation projects in 2022, with 17.66% ($205 million) going towards projects with potential health benefits

Financing is a key mechanism of country-level health adaptation; multilateral funding organisations can provide meaningful financing contributions to countries' health-related adaptation efforts. This indicator reports on multilateral funding assigned by the Green Climate Fund (GCF), one of seven multilateral funding mechanisms under the UNFCCC, for health-related adaptation projects. In 2022, 20 projects on adaptation, or on both adaptation and mitigation, were approved for a total of $1.16 billion. Of this funding, 17.66% ($205 million) went to projects with potential health benefits, with 12 of the 15 health-specific projects focusing on improved water and food security. As this indicator considers only GCF funding, it does not capture all climate funding, but does provide a representative sample of funding priorities.
