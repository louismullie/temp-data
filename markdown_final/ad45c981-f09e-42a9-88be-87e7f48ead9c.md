## Question

lipids in 25 year old

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about lipid screening and management for a 25-year-old individual. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about who should be screened and how to obtain the initial lipid measurements. Then, I should assess how common and clinically meaningful dyslipidemia is in young adults. Next, I will review risk-enhancing factors and secondary causes. After that, I need to interpret lipid values and thresholds in this age group. Then, I will outline lifestyle and pharmacologic management strategies, including monitoring. Finally, I should clarify follow-up intervals, communicate lifetime risk, and summarize practical recommendations based on guidelines and cohort data [^111yM6LJ].

> Let me first confirm screening eligibility and test modality in a 25-year-old not on lipid therapy, because I need to ensure we start with the right test under the right conditions. The 2018/2019 AHA/ACC multisociety guideline recommends obtaining a fasting or nonfasting plasma lipid profile in all adults aged 20 years and older to estimate ASCVD risk and document baseline LDL-C, with a repeat fasting panel if a nonfasting sample shows triglycerides ≥ 400 mg/dL, which fits this patient's age and allows for practical nonfasting collection with reflex to fasting when needed [^111yM6LJ] [^117FuEpU] [^115eZYdk]. I should also note that ESC/EAS guidance supports lipid profiling in young adults for risk assessment, reinforcing early baseline characterization of lipid status [^114my1o2].

> Next, I should review how prevalent and prognostically relevant dyslipidemia is in young adulthood, because that frames the urgency of intervention. The CARDIA cohort demonstrated that 87% of participants had nonoptimal lipids during ages 20–35, and cumulative exposures tracked strongly with midlife coronary artery calcium, rising from 8% CAC with optimal LDL < 70 mg/dL to 44% CAC with LDL ≥ 160 mg/dL, highlighting the importance of lipid levels in the 20s for later subclinical atherosclerosis burden [^111seh9d]. Let me also consider additional signals: lipid abnormalities track from youth to adulthood, with correlations in the 0.43–0.56 range in the Young Finns study, underscoring persistence of risk profiles over time [^114vpUiA]. Although lower in credibility, real-world data in early CAD suggest triglycerides and the TG/HDL ratio are particularly salient predictors in younger patients, a pattern that often emerges in metabolic phenotypes seen in the 20s and 30s [^115yQYXQ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before checking risk-enhancing factors and secondary causes, because in a 25-year-old the 10-year risk will appear low while lifetime risk and modifiers matter. I should confirm family history of premature ASCVD and evaluate for features suggestive of familial hypercholesterolemia, particularly if LDL-C is ≥ 190 mg/dL, as endorsed by AHA/ACC guidance for early identification and cascade screening considerations [^115eLZFi]. I need to check for diabetes, especially type 1, where lipid assessment and monitoring are recommended at initiation or adjustment of therapy and at least annually, since glycemic disorders compound lifetime risk from a young age [^111p4zUn] [^115KwzFF]. I should also review secondary causes such as hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, cholestatic liver disease, and medications including corticosteroids and retinoic acid derivatives, as these are common and reversible drivers of dyslipidemia in young adults [^111mwmAv]. Let me remember inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or HIV, where lipids should be rechecked 2–4 months after disease control given inflammation's complex effects on lipoproteins and ASCVD risk [^111wr2Jr]. For women of childbearing potential, I need to ensure pregnancy status is clarified before considering statins, and discuss contraception and reproductive planning upfront given contraindications during pregnancy, with a plan to re-evaluate lipids after pregnancy when physiology normalizes [^115eLZFi].

> Now, I will interpret lipid values and potential targets, keeping in mind that thresholds guide both intensity of lifestyle intervention and the threshold for pharmacotherapy in young adults. Let me verify LDL-C categories often applied in guidelines and practice: optimal < 100 mg/dL, borderline high 130–159 mg/dL, high 160–189 mg/dL, and very high ≥ 190 mg/dL, with the latter suggesting severe hypercholesterolemia and prompting evaluation for FH and statin therapy initiation according to AHA/ACC recommendations [^111yM6LJ]. Wait, I should also consider non-HDL-C, particularly when triglycerides are elevated, because non-HDL-C captures atherogenic lipoproteins and predicts events from youth into adulthood; recent pooled cohorts show HRs around 1.42 per z-score increase in childhood and 1.50 in adulthood, while CCS guidelines endorse non-HDL-C or ApoB as preferred parameters when triglycerides are > 1.5 mmol/L, which is common in younger adults with metabolic risk [^111mTxW9] [^111kPhbZ]. If the initial measurement is nonfasting and triglycerides are ≥ 400 mg/dL, I should double-check with a fasting profile to accurately classify severity and pancreatitis risk, as per AHA/ACC guidance [^115eZYdk].

> I will now outline lifestyle therapy, because for most 25-year-olds with nonoptimal lipids but without severe hypercholesterolemia, early, sustained risk-factor modification provides the greatest lifetime yield. Let me think about dietary patterns with reduced saturated fat and cholesterol and higher soluble fiber, consistent with heart-healthy patterns such as Mediterranean or DASH; sustained counseling from infancy through young adulthood in the STRIP program yielded durable improvements in LDL-C and broader metabolic health into the mid-20s, illustrating the long arc of benefit from dietary quality and adherence beginning early in life [^113VejJY] [^115MA1B4]. I should emphasize regular physical activity, weight optimization, smoking abstinence, and alcohol moderation as synergistic measures that favorably affect triglycerides, HDL-C, insulin resistance, and blood pressure within guideline-directed prevention frameworks for young adults [^111yM6LJ].

> Let me consider when to add pharmacotherapy, and I need to ensure I do not over-treat low short-term risk while not missing high-lifetime-risk phenotypes. I should confirm that LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL in a 25-year-old triggers statin therapy for severe hypercholesterolemia, with high-intensity statins generally preferred in the absence of contraindications, along with evaluation for FH and family cascade screening per AHA/ACC guidance [^111yM6LJ]. But wait, if triglycerides are severely elevated (for example ≥ 500 mg/dL), I should prioritize triglyceride-lowering to mitigate pancreatitis risk while continuing comprehensive lifestyle therapy and addressing secondary causes; after triglyceride reduction, I can return focus to atherogenic cholesterol metrics for ASCVD prevention in a stepwise manner [^111yM6LJ]. I should double-check monitoring intervals after pharmacotherapy initiation or dose change; fasting lipids should be rechecked in 4–12 weeks and then every 3–12 months to assess adherence and response, as recommended in cardiometabolic guidelines and diabetes standards of care when relevant to comorbid glycemic disorders [^111NrRas] [^117F7QE1]. I need to counsel on adverse effects, noting that myalgias are commonly reported in practice registries with frequencies around 27–33% among users, and I should use shared decision-making to maintain adherence while troubleshooting tolerability, especially over decades of anticipated therapy in young adults [^114zUpoV].

> Next, I should review follow-up cadence and communicate lifetime risk clearly, but I need to be careful with interval recommendations. Initially, I thought repeating a lipid panel every 4–6 years for low-risk individuals aligned with VA/DoD guidance; wait, let me verify that before concluding. Hold on, I should verify the VA/DoD recommendation; in fact, the VA/DoD 2020 guideline advises considering a lipid panel no more often than every 10 years for primary prevention in adults not on statins, so my initial 4–6 year interval attribution to VA/DoD was incorrect, and a more conservative rescreening interval is reasonable in truly low-risk individuals, with shorter intervals if risk factors emerge or change [^114Sv53X]. I need to ensure that for patients who start therapy, or those with diabetes, inflammatory disease, or other risk-enhancing conditions, monitoring is more frequent per disease-specific guidance, while reinforcing that earlier lipid lowering yields greater relative risk reductions because the age-related gradient in relative risk is steepest in younger adults, even as absolute event rates remain low in the short term [^112cUGew]. If triglycerides are > 1.5 mmol/L or the phenotype suggests atherogenic dyslipidemia, assessing non-HDL-C or ApoB can refine risk and guide therapy, consistent with CCS recommendations for younger adults with metabolic traits [^111kPhbZ].

> Finally, let me synthesize practical, patient-centered recommendations for a typical 25-year-old. I should obtain a baseline fasting or nonfasting lipid panel now if never done, with reflex fasting testing if nonfasting triglycerides are ≥ 400 mg/dL, and document LDL-C, non-HDL-C, HDL-C, and triglycerides as a foundation for lifetime risk management and trend monitoring over time [^111yM6LJ] [^115eZYdk]. I should interpret values with attention to LDL-C thresholds, non-HDL-C when triglycerides are elevated, and the presence of risk enhancers such as family history and secondary causes, recognizing that most young adults benefit most from intensive lifestyle changes and that statins are typically reserved for LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL or genetically mediated high-risk conditions, with structured follow-up to assess adherence and response if therapy is initiated [^111kPhbZ] [^111yM6LJ]. I will counsel that early optimization of lipids in the 20s and 30s substantially reduces the development of coronary plaque and long-term ASCVD, as seen in CARDIA and related analyses, and I will set a monitoring cadence that reflects baseline risk, comorbidities, and whether pharmacotherapy is used, aiming for periodic reassessment of global risk factors alongside lipid metrics to minimize cumulative exposure across the life course [^111seh9d] [^114Sv53X] [^111NrRas].

---

For a healthy 25-year-old, the typical lipid profile is: **LDL-C 90–130 mg/dL**, **HDL-C 40–60 mg/dL**, **triglycerides 70–150 mg/dL**, and **total cholesterol 150–200 mg/dL**. Lifestyle factors — diet, activity, weight, smoking, and alcohol — strongly influence these levels [^111Vy1gH], and early dyslipidemia [^111mwmAv] increases lifetime ASCVD risk [^111seh9d]. Screening is recommended at **age 20** [^111yM6LJ] and every 4–6 years if low risk, with earlier or more frequent testing for family history or other risk factors [^115eLZFi]. Management emphasizes lifestyle change, with pharmacotherapy for severe or familial dyslipidemia.

---

## Normal lipid profile ranges for 25-year-olds

The table below summarizes typical lipid ranges for healthy 25-year-olds [^111GGngR]:

| **Lipid parameter** | **Normal range** |
|-|-|
| LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) | 90–130 mg/dL (2.3–3.4 mmol/L) |
| HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) | 40–60 mg/dL (1.0–1.5 mmol/L) |
| Triglycerides (TG) | 70–150 mg/dL (0.8–1.7 mmol/L) |
| Total cholesterol (TC) | 150–200 mg/dL (3.9–5.2 mmol/L) |

---

These ranges reflect typical values in healthy young adults; **individual targets may vary** with risk factors and guideline recommendations [^114my1o2].

---

## Factors influencing lipid levels in 25-year-olds

Several factors influence **lipid levels** in young adults:

- **Diet**: High saturated/trans fats and refined carbs raise LDL and TG; diets rich in unsaturated fats, fiber, and omega-3s improve lipids [^113VejJY].
- **Physical activity**: Regular aerobic activity increases HDL and lowers LDL/TG [^111mwmAv].
- **Body weight**: Overweight/obesity raise LDL/TG and lower HDL [^111Vy1gH].
- **Smoking**: Lowers HDL and raises LDL/TG [^111mwmAv].
- **Alcohol consumption**: Moderate intake may raise HDL; excess increases TG and LDL [^111mwmAv].
- **Genetics**: Familial hypercholesterolemia and other disorders can cause severe dyslipidemia [^111yM6LJ].

---

## Prevalence of dyslipidemia in 25-year-olds

Dyslipidemia is **common in young adults**, with ~27% of US adults having elevated LDL, ~23% having low HDL, and ~30% having elevated triglycerides. These abnormalities often appear in young adulthood and persist into later life [^114vpUiA] [^114WRtMU], increasing ASCVD risk [^111seh9d].

---

## Health risks associated with abnormal lipid levels

Abnormal lipids in young adults **increase long-term ASCVD risk** [^114WRtMU] via atherosclerosis: elevated LDL and triglycerides promote plaque formation, raising the risk of coronary artery disease (myocardial infarction and angina), ischemic stroke, and peripheral artery disease. Early dyslipidemia is linked to subclinical atherosclerosis [^111seh9d] and higher lifetime ASCVD risk.

---

## Recommended screening guidelines

Initial screening should **begin at age 20** [^111yM6LJ] with a fasting or nonfasting lipid profile [^117FuEpU] to estimate ASCVD risk and document baseline LDL-C. For low-risk individuals, repeat screening every 4–6 years, with more frequent testing if lipids are elevated or risk factors are present. A fasting lipid profile is recommended when there is a family history of premature ASCVD or genetic hyperlipidemia [^115eLZFi].

---

## Lifestyle interventions for lipid management

Lifestyle interventions are **first-line** for dyslipidemia in young adults:

- **Dietary modifications**: Reduce saturated/trans fats; increase fiber, fruits, vegetables, and omega-3s [^113VejJY].
- **Physical activity**: ≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity.
- **Weight management**: Achieve and maintain healthy weight [^111Vy1gH].
- **Smoking cessation**: Stop tobacco use [^111mwmAv].
- **Alcohol moderation**: Limit intake [^111mwmAv].

---

## Pharmacological treatments

Pharmacotherapy is considered when **lifestyle changes are insufficient** or in **severe dyslipidemia**:

- **Statins**: First-line for elevated LDL or familial hypercholesterolemia.
- **Ezetimibe**: Add-on or alternative to statins.
- **PCSK9 inhibitors**: For severe hypercholesterolemia or statin intolerance.
- **Fibrates and omega-3 fatty acids**: For severe hypertriglyceridemia.

---

## Long-term cardiovascular implications

Abnormal lipids at age 25 have **significant long-term effects** [^114WRtMU], including accelerated atherosclerosis [^111seh9d], increased cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral artery disease), and reduced life expectancy due to higher ASCVD risk. Early detection and management can mitigate these risks [^111mTxW9].

---

## Gender differences in lipid profiles

In young adults, **gender differences** exist, with women typically having higher HDL than men [^111GGngR], while men often have higher LDL and generally higher triglycerides. Hormonal and lifestyle factors contribute to these patterns [^116cDpAD].

---

Lipid profiles in 25-year-olds are shaped by lifestyle, genetics, and gender; early dyslipidemia increases lifetime ASCVD risk, so **early detection and lifestyle change** are key, with pharmacotherapy for severe or familial cases [^111yM6LJ].

Dyslipidemia causes coronary heart disease in middle-aged and elderly adults, but the consequences of lipid exposure during young adulthood are unclear.

- **Objective**: To assess whether nonoptimal lipid levels during young adulthood cause atherosclerotic changes that persist into middle age.

- **Design**: Prospective cohort study.

- **Setting**: Four cities in the United States.

- **Participants**: 3,258 participants from the 5,115 black and white men and women recruited at age 18 to 30 years in 1985 to 1986 for the CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) study.

- **Measurements**: Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and coronary calcium. Time-averaged cumulative exposures to lipids between age 20 and 35 years were estimated by using repeated serum lipid measurements over 20 years in the CARDIA study. These measurements were then related to coronary calcium scores assessed later in life (45 years [SD, 4]).

- **Results**: 2,824 participants (87%) had nonoptimal levels of LDL cholesterol (≥ 2.59 mmol/L [≥ 100 mg/dL]), HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides (≥ 1.70 mmol/L [≥ 150 mg/dL]) during young adulthood. Coronary calcium prevalence two decades later was 8% in participants who maintained optimal LDL levels (< 1.81 mmol/L [< 70 mg/dL]) and 44% in participants with LDL cholesterol levels of 4.14 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) or greater (P < 0.001). The association was similar across race and sex and strongly graded, with odds ratios for coronary calcium of 1.5 (95% CI, 0.7 to 3.3) for LDL cholesterol level.

### Dyslipidemia [^111mwmAv]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on dyslipidemia:

- **Definition**: Dyslipidemia is a disorder of lipid metabolism characterized by elevated LDL cholesterol, decreased HDL cholesterol, and/or increased triglycerides, contributing to the development of atherosclerosis.

- **Pathophysiology**:
	- **Primary dyslipidemia**: Due to genetic abnormalities
	- **Secondary dyslipidemia**:
		- **Lifestyle factors**: Obesity, physical inactivity, high-carbohydrate and high-fat diets, smoking, alcohol use
		- **Medical conditions**: Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, renal failure, cholestatic liver disease, nephrotic syndrome
		- **Medications**: Corticosteroids, progestogens, androgenic steroids, thiazide diuretics, beta blockers, oral estrogens, retinoic acid derivatives

- **Epidemiology**:
	- **Prevalence in the US**: An estimated 53% of adults have at least one lipid abnormality
	- **Specific lipid abnormalities**:
		- **Elevated LDL cholesterol**: 27%
		- **Decreased HDL cholesterol**: 23%
		- **Increased triglycerides**: 30%

- **Disease course**: Lipid abnormalities contribute to the formation of atherosclerotic plaque, leading to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, and peripheral artery disease (PAD).

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Treatment with statins is associated with a relative reduction in the risk of major adverse vascular events of 22% in men and 16% in women for every 1.0 mmol/L (38.6 mg/dL) reduction in LDL cholesterol.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of dyslipidemia, particularly with respect to indications for screening, the 2019 guidelines from the AAPA, ABC, ACC, ACPM, ADA, AGS, AHA, APhA, ASPC, and PCNA recommend obtaining a fasting lipid profile in adult patients aged ≥ 20 years. This is especially advised for individuals with a family history of premature atherosclerotic vascular disease or genetic hyperlipidemia. It aids in the understanding and identification of familial lipid disorders.

### Comparison of serum lipid values in patients with coronary artery disease at < 50, 50 to 59, 60 to 69, and > 70 years of age [^115yQYXQ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

We evaluated the relation between lipids and the precocity of coronary artery disease (CAD) in the real world, as characterized by increasing statin use. The highest mean values of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and the ratio of triglycerides to HDL cholesterol were found when CAD was detected in patients who were < 50 years of age (p < 0.01 for all); the opposite occurred for HDL cholesterol (p < 0.01). Triglycerides and the ratio of triglycerides to HDL cholesterol were the most powerful independent variables related to the precocity of CAD.

### Limited impact on health and access to care for 19- to 25-year-olds following the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act [^115rt64w]. JAMA Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) allowed young adults to remain on their parents' insurance until 26 years of age. Reports indicate that this has expanded health coverage.

- **Objective**: To evaluate coverage, access to care, and health care use among 19- to 25-year-olds compared with 26- to 34-year-olds following PPACA implementation.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Data from the Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System and the National Health Interview Survey, which provide nationally representative measures of coverage, access to care, and health care use, were used to conduct the study among participants aged 19 to 25 years (young adults) and 26 to 34 years (adults) in 2009 and 2012.

- **Exposure**: Self-reported health insurance coverage.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Health status, presence of a usual source of care, and ability to afford medications, dental care, or physician visits.

- **Results**: Health coverage increased between 2009 and 2012 for 19- to 25-year-olds (68.3% to 71.7%). Using a difference-in-differences (DID) approach, after adjustment, the likelihood of having a usual source of care decreased in both groups but more significantly for 26- to 34-year-olds (DID, 2.8%; 95% CI, 0.45 to 5.15). There was no significant change in health status for 19- to 25-year-olds compared with 26- to 34-year-olds (DID, -0.5%; 95% CI, -1.87 to 0.87). There was no significant change for 19- to 25-year-olds compared with 26- to 34-year-olds in the percentage who reported receiving a routine checkup in the past year (DID, 0.3%; 95% CI, -2.25 to 2.85).

### Relation between copper, lipid profile, and cognition in elderly Jordanians [^113TE7fA]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of the study was to examine the association of serum copper and lipid concentrations with changes in cognitive function in elderly Jordanian individuals. The study population consisted of two groups: 52 dementia patients and 50 control subjects. All individuals were screened using the Mini-Mental State Examination and Clock Drawing Test. Serum copper and lipid profiles were also assessed. Results were statistically evaluated at the p < 0.05 level of significance.

The dementia group had 10.1% higher copper levels than control subjects, but this difference was not statistically significant. No significant differences could be found between the two groups in lipid profile levels. There was no significant correlation between serum copper, lipid profile, and cognitive decline in elderly Jordanians.

- **Demographic variables**: Educational level less than 12 years and illiteracy demonstrated a 3.29-fold (p = 0.026) and 6.29-fold (p = 0.002) increase in the risk of developing dementia, respectively.
- **Coffee intake**: Demonstrated a protective effect against cognitive decline, with a 6.25-fold lower risk with increased coffee intake.

### Lipid testing among patients with diabetes who receive diabetes care from primary care physicians [^1176Ubsp]. Diabetes Care (2003). Low credibility.

To identify factors related to lipid testing among patients with diabetes who receive diabetes care from primary care physicians, the study utilized North Carolina Medicare claims to identify individuals with diabetes who were cared for by primary care physicians. Lipid testing was examined in relation to sociodemographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, physician specialty, and mortality.

Based on Medicare claims from July 1997 through June 1999, 13,660 diabetic North Carolina residents with Medicare, aged 65–75, had received HbA(1c) testing from a single primary care physician during at least three of four consecutive 6-month intervals. During these two years, 31% had no lipid profile and 24% had only one lipid profile. Caucasians were 1.6 times more likely than African Americans to receive lipid profiles. Patients not receiving state Medicare assistance were 1.4 times more likely to have a lipid profile than the presumably lower-income patients receiving assistance. Patients with stroke and heart failure were less likely to receive lipid profiles. Those with no lipid profile were almost twice as likely to die from cardiovascular disease than those with at least two lipid profiles.

Adherence to lipid testing recommendations by primary care physicians for elderly patients with diabetes shows significant room for improvement. The most vulnerable patients — African Americans, the economically disadvantaged, and the medically complex — are the least likely to receive lipid testing.

### Time trends in population cholesterol levels 1986–2004: Influence of lipid-lowering drugs, obesity, smoking and educational level. The northern Sweden MONICA study [^111Vy1gH]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

To explore time trends in population total cholesterol, five population-based cross-sectional surveys were conducted between 1986 and 2004 as part of the northern Sweden MONICA study, including data from 8,827 men and women. The results indicated that age-adjusted cholesterol levels declined in men aged 25–64 years, from 6.38 to 5.78 mmol/L, and in women, from 6.32 to 5.51 mmol/L. Between 1994 and 2004, subjects aged 65–74 years were also included, showing decreases in cholesterol levels from 6.35 to 5.76 mmol/L for men, and from 7.11 to 6.24 mmol/L for women. The decreases were continuous over surveys and age groups, except in young and middle-aged men where no further decline was observed after 1999. Cohorts born between 1920 and 1939 demonstrated decreases in cholesterol over the period, while no change was observed in those born thereafter. In 2004, one-fourth of men and one-third of women aged 25–74 years achieved cholesterol levels below 5.0 mmol/L. It was noted that individuals with lower educational levels, a body mass index of 25 or higher, or who were smokers, maintained higher cholesterol levels throughout the 18 years. The use of lipid-lowering drugs, attributed to 9% of the population in 2004, was estimated to contribute, at most, to a reduction of 0.13 mmol/L in population cholesterol levels.

In conclusion, significant decreases in cholesterol levels were observed over the 18-year period. Reduced smoking may have contributed to this trend, whereas increasing obesity likely attenuated it. Lipid-lowering drugs, until recently, have had minimal effect. Socio-economic inequalities remain a persistent factor.

### Comparison of a novel method vs the Friedewald equation for estimating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels from the standard lipid profile [^115DqcJU]. JAMA (2013). Low credibility.

In clinical and research settings worldwide, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is typically estimated using the Friedewald equation. This equation assumes a fixed factor of 5 for the ratio of triglycerides to very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TG:VLDL-C); however, the actual TG:VLDL-C ratio varies significantly across the range of triglyceride and cholesterol levels.

- **Objective**: To derive and validate a more accurate method for LDL-C estimation from the standard lipid profile using an adjustable factor for the TG:VLDL-C ratio.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A convenience sample of consecutive clinical lipid profiles was obtained from 2009 through 2011 from 1,350,908 children, adolescents, and adults in the United States. Cholesterol concentrations were directly measured after vertical spin density-gradient ultracentrifugation, and triglycerides were directly measured. Lipid distributions closely matched the population-based National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Samples were randomly assigned to derivation (n = 900,605) and validation (n = 450,303) data sets.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Individual patient-level concordance in clinical practice guideline LDL-C risk classification using estimated vs. directly measured LDL-C (LDL-CD).

- **Results**: In the derivation data set, the median TG:VLDL-C was 5.2 (IQR, 4.5–6.0). The triglyceride and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels explained 65% of the variance in the TG:VLDL-C ratio. Based on strata of triglyceride and non-HDL-C values, a 180-cell table of median.

### Common lipid-altering gene variants are associated with therapeutic intervention thresholds of lipid levels in older people [^1121KGXD]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

The InCHIANTI Study of Aging recruited a total of 1,453 individuals from two towns in Tuscany, Italy, forming a population-representative sample. Of these participants, 1,155 respondents were aged 65 years or older and were eligible for inclusion in the study. The study design and protocol are detailed elsewhere. Initial assessments were conducted at participants' homes between September 1998 and March 2000, followed by two separate clinic visits 2–3 weeks later. Follow-up assessments occurred in 2001–2003 and 2004–2006. DNA was extracted from blood samples collected during the initial clinic visit, and all study participants, who were of white European descent, were asked to provide blood samples. The study received approval from the Italian National Institute of Research and Care of Aging Ethical Committee.

- **Serum measures**: Blood samples were collected in the morning after participants fasted for at least 8 hours. Serum was separated, and commercial enzyme tests (Roche Diagnostics, GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) were used to determine HDL and triglyceride levels, while LDL levels were calculated using the Friedewald formula.

- **Myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease outcomes**: Myocardial infarction or stroke events were recorded through self-report questionnaires with the question, "Have you ever had an event?" during the baseline assessment and "Has your doctor reported an event since last interview?" at the two follow-up interviews. Information was combined from both sources.

### Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels from childhood to adulthood and cardiovascular disease events [^111mTxW9]. JAMA (2024). High credibility.

Elevated non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), a recommended measure of lipid-related cardiovascular risk, is common in children and increases the risk of adult cardiovascular disease (CVD). Whether the resolution of elevated childhood non-HDL-C levels by adulthood is associated with a reduced risk of clinical CVD events is unknown.

The objective of this study was to examine the associations of non-HDL-C status between childhood and adulthood with incident CVD events. This research utilized individual participant data from six prospective cohorts of children (mean age at baseline, 10.7 years) in the United States and Finland. Recruitment took place between 1970 and 1996, with a final follow-up in 2019.

- **Exposures**: Child (age 3–19 years) and adult (age 20–40 years) non-HDL-C age- and sex-specific z scores were assessed. Categories were established according to clinical guideline-recommended cut-offs for dyslipidemia.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Incident fatal and nonfatal CVD events were adjudicated through medical records.

Over a mean follow-up duration of 8.9 years after age 40, 147 CVD events occurred among 5,121 participants (60% women; 15% Black). Both childhood and adult non-HDL-C levels were associated with an increased risk of CVD events, with hazard ratios (HR) of 1.42 (95% CI, 1.18–1.70) and 1.50 (95% CI, 1.26–1.78) for a 1-unit increase in z score, respectively. However, the association for childhood non-HDL-C was reduced after adjusting for adult levels, with an HR of 1.12 (95% CI, 0.89–1.41). A complementary analysis indicated that both childhood non-HDL-C levels and the change between childhood and adulthood were significant factors.

### Tracking of serum lipid levels, blood pressure, and body mass index from childhood to adulthood: The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study [^114vpUiA]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

The study aimed to examine the tracking and predictiveness of childhood lipid levels, blood pressure, and body mass index for risk profiles in adulthood, as well as to determine the best age to measure these childhood risk factor levels.

Study subjects were participants of the longitudinal Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study, which started in 1980 with children aged 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 years. A total of 2204 subjects participated in the 27-year follow-up in 2007, when they were aged 30 to 45 years.

In both sex groups and all age groups, childhood risk factors were significantly correlated with levels in adulthood. The correlation coefficients for cholesterol levels and body mass index ranged from 0.43 to 0.56 (P < .0001), while those for blood pressure and triglyceride levels ranged from 0.21 to 0.32 (P < .0001). To identify children with abnormal adult levels, cutoff points for lipid and blood pressure values from the National Cholesterol Education Program and the National High Blood Pressure Education Program were used, as well as international cutoff points for overweight and obesity. Age seemed to affect these associations, with the best sensitivity and specificity rates observed in 12- to 18-year-old subjects.

Childhood blood pressure, serum lipid levels, and body mass index showed strong correlations with values measured in middle age. These associations appeared to strengthen with increased age at the time of measurement.

### Metabolite profiles and the risk of metabolic syndrome in early childhood: A case-control study [^113XHV6x]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

- **Methods**:

	- **Study participants**: This study was conducted among children from the Family Atherosclerosis Monitoring In EarLY life (FAMILY) study. FAMILY is a prospective birth cohort study involving 857 predominantly white families that include 901 children recruited from Hamilton, Ontario, between 2002 and 2009, with a 10-year follow-up. Of the 676 children who completed a follow-up 5-year visit, 557 had complete anthropometric and clinical data and complete records of maternal gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Fasting serum specimens were available for 491 children who were considered for this study (consort diagram Additional file 1: Fig. S1).

	- **Biospecimen and clinical data collection**: Data collection occurred at the 5-year follow-up visit through questionnaires, physical measurements, and laboratory analysis of biospecimens as published previously. Fasting blood samples were collected, and serum was fractionated within 2 hours from collection according to standard protocols, stored at −80 °C, and shipped on dry ice. Cholesterol (LDL, HDL, and total cholesterol), triglycerides, and glucose from the fasting serum samples were analyzed at the McMaster Children's Hospital and Hamilton Health Sciences Central Research Laboratories following standardized analysis protocols.

	- **MetS in children: MetS case selection**: Cohort-specific percentiles were calculated for waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and serum fasting glucose using the most complete data sets for each variable from the total number of children who attended the 5-year visit. Standardized BMI-for-age z-scores were also determined.

### Comparison of the characteristics at diagnosis and treatment of children with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) from eight European countries [^115NnzNL]. Atherosclerosis (2020). Low credibility.

The proportion of children taking lipid-lowering therapy by follow-up age is shown in Fig. 1 (and Supplementary Table 5), and the baseline characteristics of those later taking and not taking a statin are shown in Supplementary Table 6. Overall, there was a significantly higher proportion of those where a mutation had been identified in the treated group compared to the not treated group (93% vs. 76%, p < 2.2 x 10⁻¹⁶) and a slightly higher proportion of boys than girls on treatment (50% vs. 46%, p = 0.02).

- **Treatment factors**: As shown in Supplementary Table 8, possible factors explaining this include a higher proportion of boys than girls having a detected mutation (87% vs. 84%, p = 0.05), and a family history of CHD (10% vs. 8%, p = 0.01). Overall, the boys had a lower mean age (7 years vs. 8 years, p = 0.0002) and a lower mean baseline total cholesterol (7.48 mmol/l vs. 7.62 mmol/l, p = 0.01).

- **Diagnostic levels**: At diagnosis, those subsequently on statin treatment had slightly lower mean concentrations of triglycerides (p = 0.008) and slightly higher HDL levels (p = 0.02). Mean diagnostic levels of total and LDL-C were significantly higher in the subsequently treated group. For LDL-C, the mean (SD) was 6.01 (± 1.35) mmol/l compared to 5.26 (± 1.43) mmol/l in the untreated group (p < 2.2 x 10⁻¹⁶).

- **Statin usage in young children**: The number of children under the age of 8 with available follow-up data was small, representing only 11% of all cohorts (n = 256) and 7% when the Greek cohort was excluded. Nevertheless, as expected, in all countries, the proportion of children on a statin under the age of 8 years was low, overall being 5% and ranging from 0% in the Czech Republic and Greece to 40%.

Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). High credibility.

In 2007, a meta-analysis of 61 prospective studies analyzed ischemic heart disease mortality as a function of total cholesterol or non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), stratified by sex and age (5th to 9th decade). Relative risk of ischemic heart disease mortality related to the level of total cholesterol or non-HDL-C was highest among 40–49 year-olds. Relative risk decreased in a graded fashion with each advancing decade, but it remained statistically significant to age 80–89 years. In contrast, absolute risk was lowest in the youngest age group and increased with advancing age.

The prospective Copenhagen General Study investigated the association of LDL-C with incident myocardial infarction (MI) and ASCVD in 91,131 participants ranging in age from 20–100 years old; 10,591 participants were 70–79 years old and 3,188 participants were 80–100 years old. Higher LDL-C was predictive of incident MI and ASCVD independent of age. As in the Prospective Studies Collaboration, relative risks of MI and ASCVD (expressed as adjusted hazard ratios (HRadj)) were highest in the youngest (20–49 year-old) age group (MI HRadj 1.68 [95% CI 1.45–1.87]; ASCVD HRadj 1.47 [95% CI 1.32–1.64]) and lowest in the oldest (80–100 year-old) age group (MI HRadj 1.28 [95% CI 1.08–1.52]; ASCVD HRadj 1.16 [95% CI 1.05–1.29]). By contrast, absolute risk of events was lowest in the youngest age group and highest in the oldest age group. Based on these prospective observational data, the authors estimated the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent MI or…

### Lipid distributions in the global diagnostics network across five continents [^111GGngR]. European Heart Journal (2023). Low credibility.

Lipid measurements

Each country's laboratory instruments, reagents, proficiency program participation, and population served for lipid measurements are detailed in Supplementary Data Online, Table S2. In the United States and Brazil, the Martin-Hopkins equation was used for determination of LDL-C. Direct chemical-based LDL-C assays were used for determination of LDL-C in Australia, India, Japan, Republic of Korea, Turkey, Slovakia, Germany, and Switzerland. The remaining countries used the Friedewald equation to estimate LDL-C. All laboratories participated in one or more proficiency programs to ensure the accuracy of all lipid measurements.

Statistical analysis

Results from all patients aged 20–89 years were extracted from each laboratory's clinical database and shared with the Global Diagnostics Network writing group in aggregate by individual lipid components (total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglycerides). The mean and standard deviation for each lipid component were assessed by sex and by sex-stratified age groups. Calculated and directly assessed LDL-C measurements were combined for analysis. Lipid levels were examined in mmol/L and mg/dL units; mg/dL units were converted to standard international (SI) units (mmol/L) for cholesterol by multiplying by 0.02586 and for triglycerides by multiplying by 0.01129. Given the focus of lipid treatment guidelines on LDL-C, proportions of results in the following guideline-based LDL-C categories were also assessed for each country's total population and by sex: < 1.55 mmol/L (< 60 mg/dL), 1.55–2.58 mmol/L (60–99 mg/dL), 2.59–3.35 mmol/L (100–129 mg/dL), 3.36–4.1

### A real-world evaluation of a tertiary care childhood obesity intervention to reduce metabolic risk in a hard-to-reach urban population [^116pQty6]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Abnormal lipid levels were defined as: TC ≥ 160 mg/dL; HDL ≤ 40 mg/dL; LDL ≥ 110 mg/dL; and TG ≥ 110 mg/dL for those 12 yrs. and older or ≥ 90th percentile for age and sex. An abnormally high fasting glucose level was defined as ≥ 110 mg/dL. Metabolic risk was defined as the presence of 3 or more of the following: increased waist circumference, systolic or diastolic hypertension, high TG level, low HDL level, or elevated fasting glucose concentration.

At follow-up, approximately 62% of participants experienced a reduction in or maintenance of BMI% 95, and 68% had a reduction in or maintenance of BMI z-score. There were significant reductions in both BMI% 95 and BMI z-score. The average difference in percentage points of BMI% 95 at follow-up compared to baseline was −3.0 (95% CI: −5.0, −1.1; p < 0.003). The mean difference in BMI z-score units at follow-up compared to baseline was −0.15 (95% CI: −0.2, −0.1; p < 0.0001).

Table 5 shows changes in mean blood pressure, lipid levels, and glucose measures for participants who had abnormal levels at baseline. Participants with systolic or diastolic hypertension at baseline had an average improvement in blood pressure of −15.3 mmHg (p < 0.0001) and −9.6 mmHg (p < 0.0001), respectively. Significant improvements in HDL and LDL were also observed for participants who had abnormal levels at baseline.

Primordial and primary prevention is the cornerstone for cardiometabolic health. In the randomised, controlled Special Turku Coronary Risk Factor Intervention Project (STRIP; n = 1116), a 20-year dietary counselling intervention was provided to children biannually from infancy, and cardiometabolic health benefits were observed among participants in the intervention group. Here, we report on the key results of the first follow-up conducted 6 years after the conclusion of the intervention, at age 26 years.

- **Methods**: The randomised controlled STRIP study recruited children at age 5 months from well-baby clinics in Turku, Finland, and randomly assigned them to either an intervention or control group; group allocation was unmasked. The intervention introduced participants to a heart-healthy diet, characterised by a low proportional intake of saturated fat and cholesterol, through dietary counselling and nutrition education sessions for parents and children from the age of 7 months to 20 years. Children in the control group received only basic health education provided at Finnish well-baby clinics and school health care. We assessed diet, lifestyle, and cardiometabolic risk factor data, including blood pressure, anthropometry, serum biochemistry (lipids, apolipoproteins, glucose, and insulin), and homoeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in participants at age 26 years.

- **Findings**: A total of 1116 children were included in the original STRIP study, of whom 551 provided data at the age 26 years follow-up, and data for 507 participants were analysed (243 in the intervention group).

### Comparison of lipid profiles and attainment of lipid goals in patients < 65 years versus patients ≥ 65 years (from the Lipid Treatment Assessment Project [L-TAP] 2) [^116Ji3oJ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

There is a well-established link between dyslipidemia and cardiovascular events, although this risk is modified by age. Little is known about how the treatment of dyslipidemia and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goal attainment differ between older and younger patients. We obtained clinical data from 9,926 dyslipidemic patients across nine countries in North and Latin America, Europe, and Asia from 2006 through 2007. Multivariate regressions were performed to determine predictors of lipid level goal attainment.

The study sample consisted of 5,733 adults < 65 and 4,193 adults ≥ 65 years old. Compared with younger patients, older patients were more likely to have diabetes (32.5% vs. 30.0%, p = 0.0014) and hypertension (73.4% vs. 57.0%, p < 0.0001). They were more frequently classified as high risk (68.6% vs. 53.2%, p < 0.0001) and more likely to be taking a statin (79.1% vs. 72.0%, p < 0.0001). However, they were less likely to smoke (8.2% vs. 17.6%, p < 0.0001) or to have metabolic syndrome (29.0% vs. 34.4%, p < 0.0001). Older patients had lower LDL cholesterol levels (95.1 vs. 103.9 mg/dl, p < 0.0001) and higher levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (54.2 vs. 51.5 mg/dl, p < 0.0001).

LDL cholesterol goal attainment was 74.7% in older and 71.1% in younger patients (p = 0.036). Older patients were more likely to achieve LDL targets whether at low risk (89.8% vs. 84.6%, p = 0.002), moderate risk (79.0% vs. 71.9%, p = 0.0006), or high risk (70.5% vs. 64.4%, p < 0.0001). In conclusion, older patients had different risk profiles and better lipid levels compared with their younger counterparts, and they were more likely to achieve LDL targets.

### Statin use and adverse effects among adults > 75 years of age: Insights from the Patient and Provider Assessment of Lipid Management (PALM) Registry [^114zUpoV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). High credibility.

Statin use and symptoms among older adults in routine community practice have not been well characterized since the release of the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline.

- **Methods and results**: We compared statin use and dosing between adults > 75 and ≤ 75 years old who were eligible for primary or secondary prevention statin use without considering guideline-recommended age criteria. The patients were treated at 138 US practices in the Patient and Provider Assessment of Lipid Management (PALM) registry in 2015. Patient surveys also evaluated reported symptoms while taking statins. Multivariable logistic regression models examined the association between older age and statin use and dosing. Among 6717 people enrolled, 1704 (25%) were > 75 years old.

- **Primary prevention**: Use of any statin or high-dose statin did not vary by age group: any statin, 62.6% in those > 75 years old versus 63.1% in those ≤ 75 years old (P = 0.83); high-dose statin, 10.2% versus 12.3% in the same groups (P = 0.14).

- **Secondary prevention**: Older patients were slightly less likely to receive any statin (80.1% versus 84.2% [P = 0.003]; adjusted odds ratio, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.66–1.01 [P = 0.06]), but were much less likely to receive a high-intensity statin (23.5% versus 36.2% [P < 0.0001]; adjusted odds ratio, 0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.45–0.65 [P = 0.0001]). Among statin users, older patients were slightly less likely to report any symptoms (41.3% versus 46.6%; P = 0.003) or myalgias (27.3% versus 33.3%; P < 0.001).

### Population-based plasma lipidomics reveals developmental changes in metabolism and signatures of obesity risk: A mother-offspring cohort study [^115qJN8N]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

To interrogate the changes in lipidomic profiles in early childhood, we compared the plasma lipidomic profiles of the child at birth with those at 6 years of age. A marked change (log 2 FC = −2.10 to 6.25) in the offspring lipidome was observed 6 years post-birth, with 68% of the lipids showing a relatively higher abundance and 6% showing a lower abundance in circulation (Fig. 1 E). The lipid species that were present at higher concentrations in cord blood included PUFA-containing lysoglycerophospholipid species such as LPC(20:4), LPC(22:6), LPE(20:4), and LPE(22:6), as well as several diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol species such as DG(16:0_22:6), TG(50:4) [NL-20:4], TG(56:8) [NL-22:6], and TG(58:8) [NL-22:6].

We also compared the 6-year-old pediatric and adult (postnatal mother: mean age 36 years) plasma lipidome using linear regression models. There was a substantial overlap between the pediatric and adult plasma lipidomic profiles, and the differences were smaller in magnitude than those observed in pregnancy and at birth. Levels of 40 (8%) lipid species in adults, and one lipid (PE(P-18:0/22:4)) in children, were higher (Fig. 1 F). The lipids with significantly increased levels in adults were phospholipid and triacylglycerol species that predominantly contained eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The PE-plasmalogen (PE(P)) species that were present at a higher concentration in adults contained EPA, whereas those present at a higher concentration in child plasma contained DHA.

### Myocardial infarction in young adults with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ≤ 100 mg/dL: Clinical profile and 1-year outcomes [^112fUZSz]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

The study objectives were to define the clinical profile of young adults with optimal low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels who present with acute myocardial infarctions (MIs), compare and contrast the differences in the clinical profiles of young adults admitted to the hospital with MIs who have LDL cholesterol levels ≥ 160 mg/dL, and evaluate the clinical outcomes for the two groups at 1 year.

- **Design**: A retrospective chart review was conducted on all young men (55 years) and women (65 years) admitted to the hospital for MIs within a 2-year period (n = 232). A history of cardiovascular risk factors and 1-year outcomes were obtained.

- **Setting**: The study was conducted in a rural community medical center serving a tri-state area in the midwestern United States.

- **Patients**: Patients were included in this analysis if (1) a lipid profile was drawn within 24 hours of hospital admission and (2) the patient was not receiving a statin medication on hospital admission.

- **Measurements and results**: Of the 183 patients who met the inclusion criteria, as many as 68% (124 patients) had LDL cholesterol levels ≥ 160 mg/dL. Patients were categorized into group 1 if their LDL cholesterol level was ≥ 160 mg/dL. In group 2, 92% of patients were placed on a statin medication. By 1 year, the mean LDL cholesterol level had decreased.

### Case report: Papular xanthoma in a 10-year-old female with abnormal lipid profile [^116c5kw2]. Pediatric Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Papular xanthoma is a rare normolipemic xanthomatous skin disease that primarily occurs in adults. Although this uncommon disorder has been documented in children, nearly all reported cases in the literature involved children with a normal lipid profile. We present the case of a 10-year-old girl who exhibited multiple papule xanthomas on her face, accompanied by an abnormal lipid profile. To our knowledge, this is only the second reported case of papular xanthoma in the pediatric population associated with an abnormal lipid profile.

### Trajectories of blood lipid concentrations over the adult life course and risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality: Observations from the Framingham study over 35 years [^114WRtMU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Using Samples 2A to 2E, we created trajectories for blood concentrations of total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, triglycerides, and non-HDL-C. Descriptions of each of the trajectory groups are given in a table not included in the text. As expected, because of our inclusion of lipid-lowering medication as a time-varying covariate in the trajectory models, the proportion of participants taking lipid-lowering medications directly increased with trajectory groups corresponding to increasing levels of total cholesterol, LDL-C, triglycerides, and non-HDL-C, and decreasing levels of HDL-C.

The figure displays expected group percentages and plots of the trajectories for each of the lipids.

- **Total cholesterol trajectories**: Panel A displays these, while Panel C displays the LDL-C trajectories, and Panel E shows non-HDL-C trajectories. For these lipids, groups 1 and 2 contain individuals with relatively stable lipid concentrations that range from optimal (total cholesterol: 155–165 mg/dL; LDL-C: 80–90 mg/dL; non-HDL-C: 100–115 mg/dL) to borderline (total cholesterol: 190–200 mg/dL; LDL-C: 115–120 mg/dL; non-HDL-C: 145–137 mg/dL) values. In total cholesterol group 3, cholesterol levels are elevated (220–235 mg/dL) and stable, while in the third LDL-C trajectory group, lipid levels are elevated (145 mg/dL) but decrease to borderline levels (125 mg/dL) after age 60. Similar to LDL-C group 3, non-HDL-C group 3 contains individuals whose concentrations are initially elevated (185 mg/dL) but decrease over time.

With this study, we aimed to address the following questions:

- **Correlation between umbilical cord and venous blood lipids**: Do umbilical cord blood lipid concentrations correlate with venous blood lipid concentrations in newborns?
- **Change in lipid concentrations over time**: What is the change in lipid concentrations from birth, to 2 months, and then to 14–16 months of age?
- **Prediction of dyslipidaemia**: Do lipid concentrations at birth predict dyslipidaemia at 2 months and 14–16 months of age?
- **Impact of various factors on lipid concentrations**: Do factors such as sex, gestational age, birth weight, breastfeeding, and parental lipid concentrations impact the child's lipid concentrations?

### Lescolxl [^113xnorr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Median percent change in lipid levels in adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia**: Fluvastatin capsules were studied in two open-label, uncontrolled, dose-titration trials.

- **HeFH in pediatric patients aged 10 years and older**: The first trial enrolled 29 pre-pubertal males, aged 9 to 12 years, who had an LDL-C level > 90th percentile for age and one parent with primary hypercholesterolemia and either a family history of premature ischemic heart disease or tendon xanthomas. The mean baseline LDL-C was 226 mg/dL (range, 137 to 354 mg/dL). All patients were started on fluvastatin capsules 20 mg daily with dose adjustments every 6 weeks to 40 mg daily, then 80 mg daily (40 mg twice daily), to achieve an LDL-C goal between 97 to 124 mg/dL. Endpoint analyses were performed at Year 2. Fluvastatin decreased plasma levels of Total-C and LDL-C by 21% and 27%, respectively. The mean achieved LDL-C was 161 mg/dL (range, 74 to 336 mg/dL).

The second trial enrolled 85 male and female patients, aged 10 to 16 years, who had an LDL-C > 190 mg/dL or LDL-C > 160 mg/dL and one or more risk factors for coronary heart disease, or LDL-C > 160 mg/dL and a proven LDL-receptor defect. The mean baseline LDL-C was 225 mg/dL (range, 148 to 343 mg/dL). All patients were started on fluvastatin capsules 20 mg daily with dose adjustments every 6 weeks to 40 mg daily, then 80 mg daily (LESCOL XL tablet), to achieve an LDL-C goal of < 130 mg/dL. Endpoint analyses were performed at Week 114.

### A 39-year-old woman with hypercholesterolemia [^114Q6FzV]. JAMA (2006). Low credibility.

Ms. T, a 39-year-old woman, has a total cholesterol level of 277 mg/dL (7.17 mmol/L) and well-controlled hypertension; her brother had a stroke in his 30s. She is primarily concerned with her mother's history of breast cancer, but she would like to know if she can take a dietary supplement or if she needs to take cholesterol-lowering medication, and if so, whether she will need to continue it as well as adhere to her diet for the rest of her life. Her estimated 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) is 1% to 2% using the Framingham Risk Score, but that may underestimate her true risk as an African American woman with a family history of CHD. Recommendations for her, her longer-term risk for CHD, and evidence for lipid-lowering therapies are discussed.

### Four-dimensional trapped ion mobility spectrometry lipidomics for high throughput clinical profiling of human blood samples [^113fWcez]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The next experiments were performed to learn how the individual lipidomes change over time. For reliable marker discovery and profiling, readily occurring diurnal changes of plasma lipidome, particularly of lipid mediators, are mitigated by standardized sampling procedures. Intra-individual multidien change or stability of lipidome beyond the diurnal fluctuations is, in our opinion, an additional valuable attribute to factor in for selecting and qualifying lipid clinical markers. The overlap between the respective symbols of all three time-points in the radar plot (Fig. 7a) indicated that the intra-individual lipidome was relatively constant over time. In addition, a Friedman test, chosen because the three time-points are dependent, was performed to understand the time-point variation in the lipidome. The output of the Friedman test evidenced no significant difference between the time points (Supplementary Fig. 15). The time-point variation of individual lipid classes in positive and negative ion mode (Supplementary Fig. 16) was also investigated for one of the individuals. The evaluation indicated a very low standard deviation (SD) between the time-points for most of the lipids. TG species exhibit the highest multidien variation (≥ 20%) in plasma, serum, and whole blood, which is in line with the more dynamic bodily metabolic processing of TGs.

A comparative assessment of levels of selected lipids determined by 4D lipidomics in negative and positive ion mode and by MRM (Supplementary Table 7) in all blood matrices of one individual (total 45 samples) showed CV values ≤ 25%.

### Prospective, randomized, infancy-onset trial of the effects of a low-saturated-fat, low-cholesterol diet on serum lipids and lipoproteins before school age: The special Turku coronary risk factor intervention project (STRIP) [^115MA1B4]. Circulation (2000). Low credibility.

We showed previously that repeated dietary counseling during the first 3 years of life reduces the concentration of serum nonfasting cholesterol. We have now extended the study to children 5 years of age and analyzed fasting blood samples, enabling LDL cholesterol calculations for the first time.

- **Methods and results**: Families of 7-month-old infants (n = 1062) were randomized to a control group (n = 522) or an intervention group (n = 540) that received individualized dietary counseling. The aims were a fat intake of 30% to 35% of daily energy, a saturated/monounsaturated/polyunsaturated fatty acid ratio of 1:1:1, and a cholesterol intake of < 200 mg/d. Nutrient intakes were studied biannually, nonfasting serum lipid values were studied annually, and fasting values were studied at 5 years of age. The intervention children always had lower intakes of saturated fat and cholesterol than the control children. The intervention boys had 0.39 mmol/L (P: < 0.0001) lower mean serum cholesterol values than the control boys between 13 and 60 months of age, but among girls, the difference was of marginal significance (0.15 mmol/L, P: = 0.052). Five-year-old intervention boys had 9% lower mean serum LDL cholesterol concentrations than the control boys (P: = 0.0002; 95% CI, -0.39 to -0.12 mmol/L), whereas no difference was observed in girls. In both sexes, serum triglyceride concentrations were similar in the 2 groups.

- **Conclusions**: The restriction of saturated fat and cholesterol intake by repeated, individualized dietary counseling since infancy resulted in lower serum total and LDL cholesterol concentrations.

### Association between lipid profile and circulating concentrations of estrogens in young men [^116cDpAD]. Atherosclerosis (2009). Low credibility.

Men exhibit higher rates of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality compared to pre-menopausal women. This sexual dimorphism may be linked to the sex-specific effects of sex steroids on cardiovascular risk factors. Unlike androgens, estrogens have not been extensively investigated concerning cardiovascular phenotypes in men.

- **Methods**: We examined associations of estradiol and estrone, as well as their precursors (total testosterone as well as androstenedione), with traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as lipids, blood pressure, and body mass in 933 young (median age: 19 years), apparently healthy Polish men.

- **Results**: Total estradiol was associated with total cholesterol (p = 0.006) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (p < 0.001), while estrone showed the strongest associations with both total cholesterol (p < 0.001) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (p < 0.001) in the unadjusted ANOVA analysis. In the multivariable adjusted models, a one standard deviation increase in estradiol level was linked to a 6%-standard deviation increase in total cholesterol (standardized beta = 0.06, p = 0.038) and a 6%-standard deviation decrease in HDL-cholesterol (standardized beta = -0.06, p = 0.036). An increase in estrone levels by one standard deviation was associated with respective 12%- and 13%-standard deviation increases in total cholesterol (standardized beta = 0.12, p < 0.001) and LDL-cholesterol levels (standardized beta = 0.12, p < 0.001) after controlling for other predictors of lipids. Estrone correlated linearly with androstenedione (r = 0.2).

### Long-term effectiveness of maternal dietary counseling in a low-income population: A randomized field trial [^115G633C]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

To assess the impact of dietary counseling given to mothers during the first year of infants' lives on food consumption, nutritional status, and lipid profile of the children up to 7 to 8 years old.

- **Methods**: The randomized trial was conducted with 500 mothers who gave birth to full-term infants with a birth weight of ≥ 2500 g between October 2001 and June 2002 in São Leopoldo, Brazil. Mothers were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 200) and control groups (n = 300). Those in the intervention group received counseling on breastfeeding and complementary feeding by 12 fieldworkers who conducted 10 home visits during the first year of the children's lives. Blinded fieldworkers assessed dietary and anthropometric data at 12 to 16 months, 3 to 4 years, and 7 to 8 years, and lipid profiles at 3 to 4 years and 7 to 8 years old. The lipid profile was the primary outcome.

- **Results**: Of the 500 recruited children, 397 underwent the 12- to 16-month, 354 the 3- to 4-year, and 315 the 7- to 8-year assessment. The energy-dense food intake was significantly lower in the intervention group at 12 to 16 months and 3 to 4 years old. At 3 to 4 years, serum lipid levels did not differ between groups. At 7 to 8 years, high-density lipoprotein levels were 0.11 mmol/L higher (0.00 to 0.20), and triglyceride concentration was 0.13 mmol/L lower (-0.25 to -0.01) in intervention children but only among the girls. Overweight/obesity rates did not differ between groups.

- **Conclusions**: Dietary counseling for mothers during infancy decreased energy-dense food consumption and improved lipid profile.

### Tasigna [^1149DvLm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Monitoring laboratory tests**: Complete blood counts should be performed every 2 weeks for the first 2 months and then monthly thereafter. Perform chemistry panels, including electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, liver enzymes, lipid profile, and glucose prior to therapy and periodically. Electrocardiograms should be obtained at baseline, 7 days after initiation, and periodically thereafter, as well as following dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Monitor lipid profiles and glucose periodically during the first year of Tasigna therapy and at least yearly during chronic therapy. Should treatment with any HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (a lipid-lowering agent) be needed to treat lipid elevations, evaluate the potential for a drug-drug interaction before initiating therapy, as certain HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are metabolized by the CYP3A4 pathway [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Assess glucose levels before initiating treatment with Tasigna and monitor during treatment as clinically indicated. If test results warrant therapy, physicians should follow their local standards of practice and treatment guidelines.

- **Fluid retention**: In the randomized trial in patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML in chronic phase, severe (Grade 3 or 4) fluid retention occurred in 3.9% and 2.9% of patients receiving Tasigna 300 mg twice daily and 400 mg twice daily, respectively, and in 2.5% of patients receiving imatinib. Effusions (including pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, ascites) or pulmonary edema were observed in 2.2% and 1.1% of patients receiving these treatments.

### Universal lipid screening in 9- to 11-year-olds before and after 2011 guidelines [^117KXw8X]. Academic Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine whether the 2011 guidelines for universal routine screening for dyslipidemia in children aged 9 to 11 years, published by the Expert Panel on Integrated Guidelines for Cardiovascular Health and Risk Reduction in Children and Adolescents and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, are being followed by pediatric primary-care providers.

- **Methods**: Retrospective data were obtained for 63,951 well-child visits (WCV) in children aged 9 to 11 years from two health care systems and one insurance program from 2009 to 2015. The proportion of WCV that had a lipid panel or total cholesterol test performed within one year of the visit was compared for 2009–2011 versus 2013–2015. Associations between demographic variables and lipid screening were evaluated with logistic regression. The frequency of tested children who had abnormal lipid results was evaluated.

- **Results**: Only 3.5% of 9- to 11-year WCV had lipid tests performed in association with the visit before and after the guidelines. Of those tested, 43% had an abnormal lipid result.

- **Conclusions**: Utah clinicians rarely follow guidelines for universal lipid screening of children aged 9 to 11. This represents a missed opportunity to identify children at risk for early-onset cardiovascular disease.

### Universal lipid screening among 9- to 11-year-old children: Screening results and physician management [^1134K8KJ]. Clinical Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

- **Associations between patient characteristics and lipid screening results**: Table 1 shows the associations between patient characteristics and lipid screening results. Children with overweight and those with obesity were more likely to have an abnormal lipid screen (P < 0.001). In contrast, the child's gender, age, insurance status, race/ethnicity, and family history of CVD were not associated with having an abnormal lipid screen. In a multivariate analysis, the odds of an abnormal screen for children with overweight/obesity was 4.19 times greater than children with a normal BMI for age percentile (confidence interval = 2.3–7.5, P < 0.001). Figure 3 demonstrates the association between an elevated BMI and/or a family history of CVD with an abnormal lipid screen. Notably, 30.1% (19/62) of children with an abnormal lipid screen had neither an elevated BMI nor a family history of CVD.

### Lipid testing among youth in Medicaid: The role of social determinants of health and providers [^113NKiyL]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

To assess recent temporal trends in guideline-compliant pediatric lipid testing, researchers examined the influence of social determinants of health (SDoH) and provider characteristics on the likelihood of testing in youth.

In this observational, multiyear cross-sectional study, lipid testing prevalence was calculated by year among 268,627 12-year-olds from 2015 through 2019 enrolled in Florida Medicaid. These individuals were eligible for universal lipid screening during ages 9 to 11. Additionally, 11,437 22-year-olds (2017–2019) eligible for screening during ages 17–21 were included. Trends in testing prevalence were compared by SDoH and health risk factors at two recommended ages, and associations between patient characteristics and provider type on lipid testing were modeled using generalized estimating equations.

Testing among 12-year-olds remained low between 2015 and 2019, with the highest prevalence in 2015 (8.0%) and the lowest in 2017 (6.7%). Screening compliance among 22-year-olds was highest in 2017 (21.1%) and fell to 17.8% in 2019. Hispanics and non-Hispanic Blacks in both age groups had about 2%-3% lower testing prevalence than non-Hispanic Whites. Among 12-year-olds, testing was 12.3% vs. 7.7% with and without obesity, and 14.4% vs. 7.6% with and without antipsychotic use. Participants who saw providers more likely to prescribe lipid testing were more likely to receive testing (OR = 2.3, 95% CI 2.0–2.8, P < .001).

In conclusion, although lipid testing prevalence was greatest among high-risk children, the overall prevalence of lipid testing in youth remains very low.

### Repeated serum lipid measurements during the peri-hospitalization period [^1173wT5t]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

The early treatment of hyperlipidemia in hospitalized patients confers potential benefit, yet total cholesterol is known to vary with acute illness, often delaying treatment decisions. A prospective study was conducted involving 61 patients (mean age 57 years; 49% women) admitted to an acute care community hospital with various diagnoses. Random nonfasting lipid profile measurements were taken at admission, followed by second fasting lipid profile measurements on day 3 of hospitalization or upon discharge (whichever occurred first), and final fasting lipid profile measurements 4 weeks after discharge.

All individual values of the lipid profile decreased at discharge, whereas the ratios of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) to HDL did not change significantly. The 95% confidence interval around the total cholesterol/HDL ratio for each patient was within the same National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III treatment recommendation category 42.6% of the time, whereas corresponding intervals for total cholesterol and LDL were within a single treatment category only 6.6% of the time. The total cholesterol/HDL ratio was significantly more consistent with regard to treatment implications than LDL or total cholesterol (p < 0.0001).

In conclusion, serum lipid values vary significantly during and following a hospital stay, whereas the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL remains relatively stable. This ratio may therefore serve as a more reliable basis for early treatment decisions in dyslipidemia.

### The relationship between payer type and lipid outcomes in response to clinical lifestyle interventions in youth with dyslipidemia [^113YLNA4]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

We generated summary statistics, including counts, percentages, means, and medians, as appropriate for distribution, to describe categorical and continuous study variables. Baseline characteristics were compared between payer types using t-tests for continuous data and chi-squared tests for categorical data. The triglyceride level was natural log-transformed due to a non-normal distribution. We defined abnormal lipid levels for males and females as an LDL-C greater than or equal to 130 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L), an HDL-C less than 40 mg/dL (1.03 mmol/L), non-HDL-C greater than 145 mg/dL (3.75 mmol/L), and a triglyceride level greater than or equal to 150 mg/dL (1.69 mmol/L). Race/ethnicity was self-reported and categorized as White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, other, and unknown.

BMI categorization was as follows:

- **For patients younger than 18 years, BMI was categorized as**:
	- underweight (BMI < 5th percentile)
	- normal (BMI 5th–84th percentile)
	- overweight (BMI ≥ 85th to 94th percentile)
	- obese (BMI ≥ 95th percentile)

- **For young adults aged 18–25 years old, absolute BMI cutoffs were used**:
	- normal (BMI < 25 kg/m²)
	- overweight (25 – < 30 kg/m²)
	- obese (≥ 30 kg/m²)

Corresponding BMI categories were then combined for those younger and older than 18 years of age.

### Is waist-to-height ratio a useful indicator of cardio-metabolic risk in 6–10-year-old children [^113gADPz]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Childhood obesity is a significant public health problem worldwide. Visceral obesity, particularly associated with cardio-metabolic risk, has been traditionally assessed by body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference. However, both methods rely on sex-and age-specific percentile tables and are influenced by sexual maturity. Waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) is easier to obtain, does not involve tables, and can be used to diagnose visceral obesity, even in normal-weight individuals. This study aims to compare WHtR to the 2007 World Health Organization (WHO) reference for BMI in screening for the presence of cardio-metabolic and inflammatory risk factors in 6–10-year-old children.

- **Methods**: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 175 subjects selected from the Reference Center for the Treatment of Children and Adolescents in Campos, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The subjects were classified according to the 2007 WHO standard as normal-weight (BMI z score > -1 and < 1) or overweight/obese (BMI z score ≥ 1). Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), fasting glycemia, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglyceride (TG), Homeostatic Model Assessment — Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), leukocyte count, and ultrasensitive C-reactive protein (CRP) were also analyzed.

- **Results**: There were significant correlations between WHtR and BMI z score (r = 0.88, p < 0.0001), SBP (r = 0.51, p < 0.0001), DBP (r = 0.49, p < 0.0001), LDL (r = 0.25, p < 0.0008), HDL (r = -0.28, p < 0.0002), TG (r = 0.26, p < 0.0006), HOMA-IR (r = 0.83, p < 0.0001), and CRP (r = 0.51, p < 0.0001). The WHtR and BMI areas under the curve were…

- **Dyslipidemia screening**: If there is a family history of hypercholesterolemia or a cardiovascular event before age 55 years, or if family history is unknown, then consider obtaining a fasting lipid profile on children over 2 years of age soon after diagnosis, once glucose control has been established. If family history is not of concern, then consider the first lipid screening at puberty (age 10 or older). For children diagnosed with diabetes at or after puberty, consider obtaining a fasting lipid profile soon after diagnosis, after glucose control has been established. Annual monitoring is reasonable if lipids are abnormal. If LDL cholesterol values are within the accepted risk levels, defined as below 160 mg/dL (4.1 mmol/l), or LDL cholesterol is over 30 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/l) with one or more CVD risk factors, this is considered reasonable. The goal of therapy is an LDL cholesterol value below 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/l).

- **Retinopathy**: The first ophthalmologic examination should be obtained once the child is 10 years of age or older and has had diabetes for 3 to 5 years. After the initial examination, an annual routine follow-up is generally recommended. Less frequent examinations may be acceptable.

### Cloudy cornea with arcus juvenilis in a case of dense deposit disease [^113RKge7]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A 25-year-old male patient presented with complaints of blurred vision in both eyes for the past two years. The patient was a known case of nephrotic syndrome with dyslipidemia, for which he had been on diuretics and lipid-lowering agents for three years. On examination, his visual acuity was 6/9 in both eyes, with a cloudy cornea and arcus juvenilis. Fundus examination was within normal limits.

Upon systemic evaluation, his lipid profile was deranged, with increased serum total cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides. Serum high-density lipoprotein was decreased. Renal function tests revealed elevated serum creatinine with significant proteinuria. Renal biopsy findings were suggestive of dense deposit disease on immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy.

Ocular manifestations of dense deposit disease are characterized by retinal drusen, pigmentary atrophy, choroidal neovascular membrane, and atypical serous retinopathy. To the best of our knowledge, anterior segment changes in dense deposit disease have not been reported. This is the first case reporting cloudy cornea with arcus juvenilis in a case of dense deposit disease.
