## Question

A 74-year-old male presents to his primary care physician complaining of left lower back pain. He reports a four-month history of worsening left flank pain. More recently, he has started to notice that his urine appears brown. His past medical history is notable for gout, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and myocardial infarction status-post stent placement. He has a 45 pack-year smoking history and drinks 2–3 alcoholic beverages per day. His temperature is 100.9°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 145/80 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 20/min. Physical examination is notable for left costovertebral angle tenderness. A CT of this patient's abdomen is shown in figure A. This lesion most likely arose from which of the following cells?
A. Proximal tubule cells
B. Distal convoluted tubule cells
C. Mesangial cells
D. Perirenal adipocytes

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which renal cell type is the most likely origin of the lesion seen on CT in a 74-year-old man with flank pain, hematuria, and systemic features, and to choose among proximal tubule cells, distal convoluted tubule cells, mesangial cells, or perirenal adipocytes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and whether it fits renal cell carcinoma. Then, I should verify the histologic subtypes of RCC and their established cells of origin. Next, I will examine the strength of evidence linking clear cell and papillary RCC to proximal tubule epithelium. After that, I need to check whether distal tubule or collecting duct origins are plausible alternatives in this context. Finally, I will consider why mesangial and perirenal adipocyte options are incorrect and synthesize the most likely answer with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical picture. Flank pain, hematuria, and systemic features in a heavy smoker raise concern for renal cell carcinoma, particularly clear cell RCC, which is the most common subtype and often presents with hematuria and flank pain. Given the patient's risk profile, RCC is a leading consideration here, so I should anchor on that diagnosis before proceeding to cell of origin questions [^e4b7aaaf].

> Next, I should review which RCC subtypes arise from which nephron segments. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check the canonical assignments. Clear cell RCC and papillary RCC are consistently attributed to proximal tubule epithelium, whereas chromophobe RCC is thought to originate from distal tubule/collecting duct intercalated cells. This proximal origin for ccRCC and pRCC is supported by multiple independent datasets and reviews, so proximal tubule origin is the default expectation for the most common RCCs in adults [^e86ba53f] [^42be7f70] [^883b5198].

> Wait, let me verify the evidentiary strength for proximal tubule as the cell of origin. Single-cell transcriptomics and lineage-mapping studies have shown that ccRCC and pRCC tumor programs map most closely to proximal tubule and proximal tubule progenitor-like states, reinforcing that these malignancies arise from proximal nephron segments rather than distal segments or mesenchymal cells. This strengthens the inference that a solid renal mass in an adult is most likely proximal tubule–derived if it is RCC [^e86ba53f] [^42be7f70] [^883b5198].

> I will now examine the alternative options. Distal convoluted tubule cells are not the typical origin of clear cell or papillary RCC; chromophobe RCC is the main distal/collecting duct–derived subtype, and there is no indication in the vignette that the lesion is chromophobe rather than clear cell or papillary, so distal tubule origin is less likely here. Mesangial cells are glomerular and do not give rise to RCC, so that option is incorrect. Perirenal adipocytes are stromal/supportive tissue and are not epithelial precursors of RCC, although they can be part of the tumor microenvironment; thus, they are not the cell of origin in this context [^42be7f70] [^e4b7aaaf].

> But wait, what if the lesion is not a classic RCC? Could it still be proximal tubule–derived? Even in rarer or mixed renal tumors, when RCC components are present, they still most often trace transcriptionally to proximal tubule programs, and collision tumors involving RCC elements commonly share a proximal tubule origin. This consistency across modalities supports choosing proximal tubule cells as the most likely origin unless there is specific evidence of a distal/collecting duct tumor type [^4def6bb7] [^e86ba53f].

> Let me synthesize and double-check the conclusion. Given the clinical likelihood of RCC in this patient and the established cell of origin for the most common RCC subtypes, the lesion most likely arose from proximal tubule epithelial cells. Therefore, the best answer is A. Proximal tubule cells, with the caveat that definitive subtype would require histopathology, but the pretest probability strongly favors proximal tubule origin here [^e86ba53f] [^42be7f70] [^883b5198].

---

The most likely origin of the renal lesion in this 74-year-old male with flank pain, hematuria, and systemic symptoms is **proximal tubule cells** [^e86ba53f], as clear cell and papillary renal cell carcinomas — the most common renal malignancies in adults — arise from the proximal tubule epithelium [^42be7f70]. Distal convoluted tubule cells give rise to chromophobe RCC, mesangial cells are glomerular and not a source of renal cell carcinoma, and perirenal adipocytes are supportive stroma rather than epithelial precursors [^883b5198].

---

## Histopathological evidence for proximal tubule origin

- **Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)**: ccRCC is the most common renal malignancy in adults, accounting for approximately 70–75% of cases [^c5d9ea95]. Extensive histopathological and molecular studies have demonstrated that ccRCC originates from the proximal tubule epithelial cells [^e86ba53f]. The proximal tubule is responsible for the majority of reabsorption and secretion processes in the nephron, making it highly metabolically active and susceptible to malignant transformation [^bb12e49a].

- **Papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC)**: pRCC is the second most common renal malignancy, accounting for approximately 10–15% of cases. Recent single-cell transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility studies have identified proximal tubule cells as the cell of origin for pRCC, particularly a specific subtype of proximal tubule cells with distinct molecular signatures [^8bdfa695] [^883b5198].

- **Molecular markers**: Proximal tubule-specific markers such as aquaporin-1 (AQP1), megalin (LRP2), and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) are frequently expressed in ccRCC and pRCC, further supporting their origin from proximal tubule cells [^notfound].

---

## Clinical correlation with patient presentation

The patient's presentation with flank pain, hematuria, and systemic symptoms (fever, tachycardia) is **highly consistent with renal cell carcinoma**, particularly ccRCC or pRCC. These malignancies typically present with:

- **Flank pain**: Due to tumor growth and invasion of renal parenchyma or surrounding structures.

- **Hematuria**: Resulting from tumor invasion of the renal pelvis or calyces, causing bleeding into the urinary tract.

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, weight loss, and fatigue are common paraneoplastic manifestations of renal cell carcinoma.

Given the patient's risk factors (smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia) and clinical presentation, the likelihood of renal cell carcinoma originating from proximal tubule cells is **significant** [^e4b7aaaf].

---

## Distal convoluted tubule cells

Distal convoluted tubule cells are primarily involved in **fine regulation of electrolyte balance, acid-base homeostasis, and blood pressure control** [^757d3bf9]. Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (chRCC) is known to originate from distal tubule cells, particularly intercalated cells of the collecting duct [^883b5198]. However, chRCC typically presents with a different clinical profile and is less commonly associated with hematuria and systemic symptoms compared to ccRCC and pRCC [^notfound].

---

## Mesangial cells

Mesangial cells are located within the **renal glomerulus** and primarily function in supporting the glomerular capillary network and regulating filtration. They are not involved in the pathogenesis of renal cell carcinoma and therefore cannot be considered the origin of the lesion in this patient [^883b5198].

---

## Perirenal adipocytes

Perirenal adipocytes are **supportive stromal cells** surrounding the kidney and are not epithelial in origin. They do not give rise to renal cell carcinoma and are not implicated in the pathogenesis of renal malignancies [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and answer

Based on the clinical presentation, histopathological evidence, and molecular studies, the renal lesion most likely arose from **proximal tubule cells** [^e86ba53f]. Clear cell and papillary renal cell carcinomas, which are the most common renal malignancies in adults, originate from proximal tubule epithelial cells [^42be7f70]. Therefore, the correct answer is **A. Proximal tubule cells**.

### The kidney precision medicine project and single-cell biology of the injured proximal tubule [^16edd26b]. The American Journal of Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has led to major advances in our understanding of proximal tubule subtypes in health and disease. The proximal tubule serves essential functions in overall homeostasis, but pathologic or physiological perturbations can affect its transcriptomic signature and corresponding tasks. These alterations in proximal tubular cells are often described within a scRNA-seq atlas as cell states, which are pathophysiological subclassifications based on molecular and morphologic changes in a cell's response to that injury compared with its native state. This review describes the major cell states defined in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project's scRNA-seq atlas. It then identifies the overlap between the Kidney Precision Medicine Project and other seminal works that may use different nomenclature or cluster proximal tubule cells at different resolutions to define cell state subtypes. The goal is for the reader to understand the key transcriptomic markers of important cellular injury and regeneration processes across this highly dynamic and evolving field.

### Proximal tubular secretory clearance: a neglected partner of kidney function [^9f09c1b7]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

The secretion of small molecules by the proximal tubules of the kidneys represents a vital homeostatic function for rapidly clearing endogenous solutes and medications from the circulation. After filtration at the glomerulus, renal blood flow is directed through a network of peritubular capillaries, where transporters of the proximal tubules actively secrete putative uremic toxins and hundreds of commonly prescribed drugs into the urine, including protein-bound substances that cannot readily cross the glomerular basement membrane. Despite its central physiologic importance, tubular secretory clearance is rarely measured or even estimated in clinical or research settings. Major barriers to estimating tubular solute clearance include uncertainty regarding optimal endogenous secretory markers and a lack of standardized laboratory assays. The creation of new methods to measure tubular secretion could catalyze advances in kidney disease research and clinical care. Differences in secretory clearance relative to the GFR could help distinguish among the causes of CKD, particularly for disorders that primarily affect the tubulointerstitium. As the primary mechanism by which the kidneys excrete medications, tubular secretory clearance offers promise for improving kidney medication dosing, which is currently exclusively on the basis of filtration. The differing metabolic profiles of retained solutes eliminated by secretion versus glomerular filtration suggest that secretory clearance could uniquely inform uremic toxicity, refine existing measures of residual kidney function, and improve prediction of cardiovascular and kidney disease outcomes. Interdisciplinary research across clinical, translational, and laboratory medicine is needed to bring this often neglected kidney function into the limelight.

### The proximal tubule, protein uptake, and the riddle of the segments [^c696bcca]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

The proximal tubule is divided anatomically into 3 distinct segments-S1 to S3-on the basis of differences in cellular ultrastructure, but the functional processes that define and shape these remain elusive. In a new study, Christensen used 3-dimensional nephron reconstruction, electron microscopy, and antibody staining to precisely map protein uptake to the structure of the proximal tubule. They reported striking axial patterns in endocytosis along the segments, which showed substantial plasticity in disease states.

### Protein handling in kidney tubules [^be697074]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

The kidney proximal tubule reabsorbs and degrades filtered plasma proteins to reclaim valuable nutrients and maintain body homeostasis. Defects in this process result in proteinuria, one of the most frequently used biomarkers of kidney disease. Filtered proteins enter proximal tubules via receptor-mediated endocytosis and are processed within a highly developed apical endo-lysosomal system (ELS). Proteinuria is a strong risk factor for chronic kidney disease progression and genetic disorders of the ELS cause hereditary kidney diseases, so deepening understanding of how the proximal tubule handles proteins is crucial for translational nephrology. Moreover, the ELS is both an entry point for nephrotoxins that induce tubular damage and a target for novel therapies to prevent it. Cutting-edge research techniques, such as functional intravital imaging and computational modelling, are shedding light on spatial and integrative aspects of renal tubular protein processing in vivo, how these are altered under pathological conditions and the consequences for other tubular functions. These insights have potentially important implications for understanding the origins of systemic complications arising in proteinuric states, and might lead to the development of new ways of monitoring and treating kidney diseases.

### How much can the tubule regenerate and who does it? An open question [^48718ec8]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

The tubular compartment of the kidney is the primary site of a wide range of insults that can result in acute kidney injury (AKI), a condition associated with high mortality and an increased risk to develop end-stage renal disease. Nevertheless, kidney function is often quickly recovered after tubular injury. How this happens has only partially been unveiled. Indeed, although it has clearly been demonstrated that regenerated epithelial cells arise from survived intratubular cells, the true entity, as well as the cellular source of this regenerative process, remains mostly unknown. Is whichever proximal tubular epithelial cell able to dedifferentiate and divide to replace neighboring lost tubular cells, thus suggesting an extreme regenerative ability of residual tubular epithelium, or is the regenerative potential of tubular epithelium limited, and mostly related to a preexisting population of intratubular scattered progenitor cells which are more resistant to death? Gaining insights on how this process takes place is essential for developing new therapeutic strategies to prevent AKI, as well as AKI-related chronic kidney disease. The aim of this review is to discuss why the answers to these questions are still open, and how further investigations are needed to understand which is the true regenerative potential of the tubule and who are the players that allow functional recovery after AKI.

### Blood pressure regulation by the angiotensin type 1 receptor in the proximal tubule [^18a8f24c]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Homeostatic actions of the RAS, such as increasing blood pressure (BP) and vasoconstriction, are mediated via type 1 (AT1) receptors for angiotensin II. All components of the RAS are present in the renal proximal tubule, which reabsorbs the bulk of the glomerular filtrate, making this segment of the nephron a location of great interest for solute handling under RAS influence. This review highlights recent studies that illustrate the key role of renal proximal tubule AT1 receptors in BP regulation.

Recent Findings

A variety of investigative approaches have demonstrated that angiotensin II signaling via AT1a receptors, specifically in the renal proximal tubule, is a major regulator of BP and sodium homeostasis. Reduction of proximal tubule AT1a receptors led to lower BPs, whereas overexpression generally caused increased BPs.

Summary

AT1a receptors in the proximal tubule are critical to the regulation of BP by the kidney and the RAS. The pattern of BP modulation is associated with alterations in sodium transporters. As a key site for sodium homeostasis, the renal proximal tubule could hence be a potential target in the treatment of hypertension.

### Development of a microphysiological model of human kidney proximal tubule function [^31c58d9d]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

The kidney proximal tubule is the primary site in the nephron for excretion of waste products through a combination of active uptake and secretory processes and is also a primary target of drug-induced nephrotoxicity. Here, we describe the development and functional characterization of a 3-dimensional flow-directed human kidney proximal tubule microphysiological system. The system replicates the polarity of the proximal tubule, expresses appropriate marker proteins, exhibits biochemical and synthetic activities, as well as secretory and reabsorptive processes associated with proximal tubule function in vivo. This microphysiological system can serve as an ideal platform for ex vivo modeling of renal drug clearance and drug-induced nephrotoxicity. Additionally, this novel system can be used for preclinical screening of new chemical compounds prior to initiating human clinical trials.

### Mechanistic insights into the primary and secondary alterations of renal ion and water transport in the distal nephron [^23384ab8]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Functional specificity of renal segments and associated pathologies

Proximal tubules. The proximal tubule, subdivided into three segments (proximal convoluted tubule [PCT], proximal straight tubule, and proximal segment 3 [S3]), represents roughly 80% of the renal epithelial cells. It plays multiple roles (Fig. 2), mainly by reabsorbing large amounts of molecules (low molecular mass proteins, amino‐acids, sugars, water) and ions (P i, K +, HCO 3 –, Na +, etc.). For instance, it reabsorbs around 85% of the filtered P i and 70% of the filtered Na +. Proximal tubules also play a central role in acid–base regulation by reabsorbing the majority of filtered bicarbonate and producing ammonia, allowing protons to be secreted under the ammonium form (for review, see). Because of these general functions, the alteration of the proximal tubule may have global effects, known as the renal Fanconi syndrome and characterized by a loss of Pi, leading to hypophosphatemia, of glucose, amino‐acids, and proteins in addition to the development of renal tubular acidosis and apparition of cystinosis. More specific alterations lead to isolated syndromes; for instance, an X‐linked mutation of the CLCN5 genes (encoding for a chloride/proton exchanger) causes the Dent syndrome. Pharmacological treatments also impact the proximal tubule functions. For instance, the anticancer drug, cisplatin, specifically targets and kills the proximal tubule cells of the S3 segment, leading to tubular damage and dysfunction with Na +, K +, and Mg 2+ wasting that may, ultimately, end in acute kidney disease. This cell specificity is due to the expression of OCT2 (organic cation transporter 2) at the basolateral membrane of the proximal tubule cells, allowing cisplatin to be highly concentrated in their cytoplasm. On the other hand, proximal tubule cells may be purposefully targeted to treat diseases. Thus, a recent major advance in the treatment of diabetes and hypertension concerns the inhibition of a sodium/glucose transporter (SGLT2) localized at the apical side of the proximal tubule cells. This inhibition has demonstrated a remarkable efficiency in the treatment of diabetes by allowing the kidney to excrete glucose, but it is also a promising therapy to decrease blood pressure that is or is not associated with diabetes, and has proven efficient in reducing GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) decline in proteinuric chronic kidney diseases.

Renal glucose transport. Reabsorption of glucose by SGLT2 (SLC5A2) transporters in early proximal tubule (upper cell model) and SGLT1 (SLC5A1) in late proximal tubule (lower cell model). In both cell types, transport is energized by Na + /K + -ATPases. Glucose exits cells via GLUT2 (SLC2A2) transporters.

This review will focus on inhibitors of proximal tubule transport processes and their established or possible use in the context of kidney disease (Table 1). These inhibitors either increase clearance of metabolites or modulate proximal tubule metabolism, or both, and thereby exert beneficial effects. Open issues and challenges will be discussed.

INTRODUCTION

The proximal tubule is the nephron segment responsible for the reabsorption of approximately 60% of the filtered amount of water and salt. Moreover, it reabsorbs nearly all filtered glucose and amino acids, and a major part of filtered phosphate, bicarbonate and low molecular weight proteins. Reabsorption of these important solutes is achieved by the concerted action of various plasma membrane transport proteins located in the luminal and basolateral membranes of the cells lining the proximal tubule.

Morphologically, the proximal tubule is optimized to maximize transport. Both, luminal and basolateral membranes have a highly enlarged surface to interact with primary urine or interstitial fluids/blood. The luminal membrane is formed by microvilli, while the basolateral membrane is largely invaginated. Most transport processes are driven by the activity of the basolaterally located Na + /K + -ATPase, a pump that hydrolyses ATP to pump 3 Na + to the basolateral interstitial space in exchange for 2 K + ions that are pumped into cells (see Fig. 1). Na + /K + -ATPase activity creates a chemical gradient for sodium (which is around 140 mmol/L in primary urine and about 10 mmol/L intracellularly) and an electrical gradient (with a transmembrane potential of around –60 mV) that together favour the inward flux of Na + and cotransport of other substrates even against their chemical gradient (e.g. for amino acids, glucose or phosphate). This transcellular transport of substrates then also energizes paracellular movement of further ions including also calcium, bicarbonate, sodium and chloride. The enormous transport activity of the proximal tubule thus depends mostly on Na + /K + -ATPase activity and the provision of sufficient amounts of ATP. Proximal tubule cells are very rich in mitochondria that mostly use aerobic fatty acid oxidation to generate ATP, while there is only very little glycolytic activity. Mitochondrial activity depends on sufficient oxygen supply and this strong dependency explains also the high vulnerability of proximal tubule cells to hypoxic insults such as in acute kidney injury. On the other hand, conditions that reduce or increase the workload of the proximal tubule, e.g. because of changes in filtered solute load, affect overall energy metabolism and requirements of proximal tubule cells.

### Effects of ATRAP in renal proximal tubules on angiotensin-dependent hypertension [^390baa06]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Generation of PT‐KO Mice

To investigate the functional role of renal proximal tubule ATRAP in angiotensin‐dependent hypertension, we generated PT‐KO mice using the Cre/loxP system and Pepck ‐Cre. To determine expression and distribution of ATRAP in the kidneys of PT‐KO mice, we performed immunohistochemical examination using anti‐ATRAP antibody and antibodies against specific nephron markers. Specifically, we used a monoclonal antibody against calbindin‐D, a calcium‐binding protein expressed primarily in distal tubules, and a monoclonal antibody against megalin, which is specifically expressed in the apical side of proximal tubules. Consecutive sections stained with specific antibodies showed specifically reduced ATRAP immunostaining in renal proximal tubules of PT‐KO mice compared with WT mice (Figure 1 A).

To more strictly evaluate proximal tubule–specific reduction of ATRAP expression in PT‐KO mice, we compared ATRAP expression in proximal and distal tubules between PT‐KO and WT mice using LMD. We distinguished between proximal and distal tubules based on morphological features (eg, brush border) and then microdissected them from the kidneys of PT‐KO and WT mice (Figure 1 B). Megalin mRNA expression was predominantly observed in a sample from proximal tubules but not distal tubules (Figure 1 C). Calbindin‐D mRNA expression was almost all observed in a sample from distal tubules but not proximal tubules (Figure 1 D). These results show correct sampling by LMD. ATRAP mRNA expression was decreased by ≈80% in proximal tubules of PT‐KO mice compared with WT mice (2‐factor ANOVA followed by Bonferroni multiple comparison test, P < 0.01; Figure 1 E). In contrast, ATRAP mRNA expression in distal tubules was comparable between PT‐KO and WT mice.

### Tubular injury in diabetic kidney disease: early diagnosis and intervention strategies [^6b9303f8]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Therefore, this review aims to evaluate the crucial role of renal tubular injury in DKD pathogenesis, going beyond the traditional focus on the glomerulus. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying renal tubular injury is of great significance for developing novel therapeutic interventions, identifying drug intervention targets, and halting DKD progression.

A comprehensive literature search was conducted using the PubMed and Web of Science databases for articles published from inception until 30 June 2025. The search terms included combinations of 'diabetic kidney disease', 'diabetic nephropathy', 'tubular injury', 'proximal tubule', 'mechanism', 'biomarker', 'therapy', and 'treatment'. The search was focused on original research articles, systematic reviews, and meta‐analyses. Articles were selected based on their relevance to the molecular mechanisms, biomarkers, and therapeutic interventions specific to tubular injury in DKD.

### Proximal renal tubular acidosis: a not so rare disorder of multiple etiologies [^5b03b74f]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Bicarbonate is freely filtered, and its concentration in the glomerular filtrate is equal to that in plasma (∼25 mEq/L). The majority of the filtered HCO 3 (∼80%) is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule and the remaining 20% is reclaimed by the loop of Henle, distal tubules and collecting tubules. In an individual with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 100 mL/min, ∼2500 mEq of HCO 3 is filtered daily, and virtually all of this HCO 3 is reabsorbed so that essentially none appears in the urine. Because the vast majority of HCO 3 is normally reclaimed in the proximal tubule, the finding of urinary HCO 3 wastage is usually taken as evidence of a defect in proximal tubular HCO 3 reabsorption. When there is a major defect in HCO 3 reabsorption in the proximal tubule, a larger quantity of filtered HCO 3 is delivered to the distal segments, including the thick ascending limb, overwhelming the distal system and thereby causing urinary HCO 3 wastage, which is the hallmark of the derangement underlying proximal (or Type II) RTA.

In recent years, there has been significant progress in the understanding of the mechanisms causing genetic proximal renal tubular acidosis (RTA). Moreover, new causes of drug-induced RTA have been recognized. In this review, we will discuss the mechanisms involved in the causation of hereditary proximal RTA as well as acquired causes with an emphasis on drug-induced proximal RTA.

Isolated proximal RTA versus Fanconi syndrome

Proximal RTA as an isolated defect in HCO 3 transport is rare. It is characterized by a decreased rate of HCO 3 reabsorption in the proximal tubule in the absence of alterations in the transport of other solutes. The impairment in HCO 3 reabsorption was initially characterized as a decrease in the renal threshold for HCO 3 reabsorption.

More commonly, proximal RTA is associated with generalized dysfunction of the proximal tubule as part of the Fanconi syndrome. Isolated proximal RTA can be autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive and sporadic (Table 1). The autosomal recessive type is associated with severe growth retardation, ocular abnormalities such as glaucoma, cataracts and band keratopathy, and mental retardation. Autosomal dominant proximal RTA, to our knowledge, has been reported in a single Costa Rican family. The clinical features include mild growth retardation and reduced bone density. Sporadic isolated proximal RTA is a non-familial transient disorder that has been reported during infancy. Patients with this disorder have defective renal and intestinal bicarbonate reabsorption.

### Proximal tubule responses to injury: interrogation by single-cell transcriptomics [^0cc82ab8]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in approximately 10–15% of patients admitted to hospital and is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Despite recent advances, management of patients with AKI is still mainly supportive, including the avoidance of nephrotoxins, volume and haemodynamic management and renal replacement therapy. A better understanding of the renal response to injury is the prerequisite to overcome current limitations in AKI diagnostics and therapy.

Recent Findings

Single-cell technologies provided new opportunities to study the complexity of the kidney and have been instrumental for rapid advancements in the understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of AKI.

Summary

We provide an update on single-cell technologies and we summarize the recent discoveries on the cellular response to injury in proximal tubule cells from the early response in AKI, to the mechanisms of tubule repair and the relevance of maladaptive tubule repair in the transition to chronic kidney disease.

### Controlling nephron precursor differentiation to generate proximal-biased kidney organoids with emerging maturity [^21947797]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The kidney maintains fluid homeostasis by reabsorbing essential compounds and excreting waste. Proximal tubule cells, crucial for reabsorbing sugars, ions, and amino acids, are highly susceptible to injury, often leading to pathologies necessitating dialysis or transplants. Human pluripotent stem cell-derived kidney organoids offer a platform to model renal development, function, and disease, but proximal nephron differentiation and maturation in these structures is incomplete. Here, we drive proximal tubule development in pluripotent stem cell-derived kidney organoids by mimicking in vivo proximal differentiation. Transient PI3K inhibition during early nephrogenesis activates Notch signaling, shifting nephron axial differentiation towards epithelial and proximal precursor states that mature to proximal convoluted tubule cells broadly expressing physiology-imparting solute carriers including organic cation and organic anion family members. The "proximal-biased" organoids thus acquire function, and on exposure to nephrotoxic injury, display tubular collapse and DNA damage, and upregulate injury response markers HAVCR1/KIM1 and SOX9 while downregulating proximal transcription factor HNF4A. Here, we show that proximally biased human-derived kidney organoids provide a robust model to study nephron development, injury responses, and a platform for therapeutic discovery.

### Metabolic heavyweight: thick ascending limb or proximal tubule? Next round [^062c800e]. Kidney International (2025). Medium credibility.

In this issue of Kidney International, investigators define the thick ascending limb as the most metabolically active cell in the kidney using a combination of single-cell techniques and mass spectrometry imaging with stable isotope tracing studies. They show that the thick ascending limb is particularly susceptible to acute kidney injury and resistant to repair. These data are discussed in the context of the longstanding debate regarding the relative roles of thick ascending limb and proximal tubules in acute kidney injury.

### Proximal tubule angiotensinogen modulation of arterial pressure [^c4840e0f]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although the existence of a complete intrarenal renin-angiotensin system is now well established, its role in modulating tubule sodium transport and blood pressure is incompletely understood. Several recent studies have shed light on one component of the system, proximal tubule-derived angiotensinogen (AGT). This review discusses the synthesis, regulation and function of AGT in the proximal tubule.

Recent Findings

Under normal sodium intake, AGT within the S1 and S2 segments of the proximal tubule may derive from the systemic circulation, whereas the S3 segment synthesizes AGT. Urinary AGT likely primarily reflects proximal tubule-derived AGT. Proximal tubule AGT synthesis is regulated by high Na intake, angiotensin-II and inflammatory cytokines. Transgenic expression of mouse AGT in the proximal tubule causes hypertension. Overexpression of rat AGT in the proximal tubule leads to hypertension, enhanced reactive oxygen species generation via NADPH oxidase, tubular apoptosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis; these effects can be mitigated by catalase overexpression.

Summary

Proximal tubule-derived AGT has the potential to modulate blood pressure and sodium balance, and promote renal injury. Interactions with the systemic renin-angiotensin system may influence the role of proximal tubule-derived AGT in the kidney.

### Mitochondrial organization in the developing proximal tubule is controlled by LRRK2 [^d1cd7605]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The proximal tubule of the nephron performs energy-demanding functions such as resorption of water, amino acids and glucose. Formation of the energy-producing machinery is an essential step in proximal tubule epithelial cell differentiation, and this report asks how mitochondria are localized within these cells. We show that mitochondria move from the apical to basolateral side of the proximal tubule cell coincident with the initiation of lumen flow and that proximal tubules deficient in filtration maintain mitochondria in the apical position. Mitochondrial localization depends on the activity of LRRK2 and modeling fluid flow on cultured proximal tubule epithelial cells demonstrates that LRRK2 activity is regulated by fluid shear stress, explaining how onset of flow in the newly differentiated proximal tubule may trigger the apical-to-basolateral dissemination of mitochondria. These findings indicate that mitochondrial redistribution is one component of a cellular program in the nascent proximal tubule that drives function and that this process is triggered by flow.

### SARS-CoV-2 causes a specific dysfunction of the kidney proximal tubule [^386f3107]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is commonly associated with kidney damage, and the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is highly expressed in the proximal tubule cells. Whether patients with COVID-19 present specific manifestations of proximal tubule dysfunction remains unknown. To test this, we examined a cohort of 49 patients requiring hospitalization in a large academic hospital in Brussels, Belgium. There was evidence of proximal tubule dysfunction in a subset of patients with COVID-19, as attested by low-molecular-weight proteinuria (70–80%), neutral aminoaciduria (46%), and defective handling of uric acid (46%) or phosphate (19%). None of the patients had normoglycemic glucosuria. Proximal tubule dysfunction was independent of pre-existing comorbidities, glomerular proteinuria, nephrotoxic medications or viral load. At the structural level, kidneys from patients with COVID-19 showed prominent tubular injury, including in the initial part of the proximal tubule, with brush border loss, acute tubular necrosis, intraluminal debris, and a marked decrease in the expression of megalin in the brush border. Transmission electron microscopy identified particles resembling coronaviruses in vacuoles or cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum in proximal tubule cells. Among features of proximal tubule dysfunction, hypouricemia with inappropriate uricosuria was independently associated with disease severity and with a significant increase in the risk of respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation using Cox (adjusted hazard ratio 6.2, 95% CI 1.9–20.1) or competing risks (adjusted sub-distribution hazard ratio 12.1, 95% CI 2.7–55.4) survival models. Thus, our data establish that SARS-CoV-2 causes specific manifestations of proximal tubule dysfunction and provide novel insights into COVID-19 severity and outcome.

### Sirtuin and metabolic kidney disease [^935c62c4]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Proximal tubule–specific Sirt1 genetically modified mice

Proximal tubules, which actively mediate reabsorption and require vast quantities of energy, suggesting the potential importance of Sirt1 in this tissue. Sirt1 is also thought to have a critical role in nephropathy and renal injury in diabetes, an energy metabolism dysfunction disease. The biological significance of Sirt1 was examined using proximal tubule–specific Sirt1 genetically modified mice. In STZ-induced diabetic mice models, expression of Sirt1 in proximal tubules of wild-type mice was significantly reduced at 8 weeks after STZ administration, and further reduced at 24 weeks. Reduction in glomeruli was first observed at 24 weeks after administration. At 8 weeks, serum glucose increased, whereas albuminuria, signifying glomerular failure, was not yet observed, indicating that proximal tubule integrity was disrupted at the molecular level before glomerular failure. Overexpression of Sirt1 in proximal tubules of transgenic mice improved the downregulation of Sirt1 not only in proximal tubules but also in podocytes at 24 weeks after STZ administration. Although Sirt1 was overexpressed only in proximal tubules and serum glucose levels did not fall in transgenic mice, albuminuria at 24 weeks was scarcely detected and foot process effacement of podocytes was mitigated. The amelioration of albuminuria in transgenic mice was not complete and it is deduced that Sirt1 overexpression in proximal tubules followed by Sirt1 recovery in podocytes overcame, to a certain extent, a harmful influence of high glucose on podocytes.

Gene profiling showed a significant difference in expression levels of claudin-1, a tight junction component, between STZ-treated wild-type and transgenic mice. In wild-type mice, claudin-1 expression was only detected in parietal epithelial cells (PEC) of the Bowman' capsule, and was strongly expressed in PEC and glomerular podocytes in the diabetic model. The increased expression was suppressed in transgenic mice. Using laser microdissection, it was observed that STZ administration in wild-type mice resulted in decreased Sirt1 expression in both proximal tubules and PEC and increased claudin-1 expression in PEC. In transgenic mice, although the mice overexpressed Sirt1 only in proximal tubules, the Sirt1 expression level increased also in PEC, and claudin-1 expression decreased in PEC.

Introduction of claudin-1 expression vector into cultured podocytes led to suppression of podocin and synaptopodin expression, which regulate the albumin permeability of podocytes. Furthermore, the injection of claudin-1 gene-integrated Sendai virus vector successfully led to overexpression of claudin-1 protein in the kidneys of wild-type mice and resulted in increased albuminuria and aggravation of podocyte foot process effacement.

See supplementary material, Video S1, for a 3D reconstruction. (B) Percentage of STCs present as single cells or in groups of more than two cells in each normal human kidney. (C) Percentage of STCs at inner bends of proximal tubule and located elsewhere inside proximal tubule in each normal human kidney. (D) Immunofluorescence staining of normal human kidney for vimentin (red) and PFKP (green). STCs show co‐expression of both markers (white arrows).

Additionally, we identified PFKP as a novel STC marker, confirmed by co‐expression with vimentin (Figure 1D). STCs stained for PFKP or vimentin were observed in AQP1, glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), and megalin (LRP2) expressing proximal tubule segments (supplementary material, Figure S3A–C*). GLUT2 and LRP2 are expressed in the proximal tubule segments S1 and S2, whereas AQP1 is highly expressed in the proximal straight tubules and shows a less abundant expression in the convoluted part of the proximal tubule. These data indicate the presence of STCs in all segments of the proximal tubule.

### Deletion of the epidermal growth factor receptor in renal proximal tubule epithelial cells delays recovery from acute kidney injury [^5be0b197]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in 1% of hospital admissions, and up to 7% of hospitalized patients develop AKI. At present, therapy for AKI is predominantly supportive, and the mortality remains unacceptably high. Ischemia–reperfusion injury (I–R) is one of the most common causes of AKI, and the underlying pathogenesis involves the injury to nephron segments both from ischemia itself and from the inflammatory response. The S3 segment of the proximal tubules is most vulnerable to I–R injury. As a result of I–R injury, renal proximal tubule cells exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction, ATP depletion, impaired solute and ion transport, loss of cell polarity, and cytoskeletal disruption.

The kidney has a remarkable capacity for regeneration, as evidenced by complete recovery of renal function following I–R injury. However, there remains controversy about the mechanisms underlying renal recovery from AKI. It is now considered unlikely that bone marrow–derived stem cells serve as the direct precursor for regenerating tubule epithelial cells, although some studies have suggested that an interstitial, non-epithelial stem cell population might exist in adult kidney that could be recruited after injury to supply epithelial progenitors and contribute directly to nephron repair. Studies in which renal epithelial cells were labeled using Cre-Lox technology have demonstrated that intrinsic epithelial cells are the major cells responsible for nephron repair in response to I–R injury.

### Renal metabolism and hypertension [^bb12e49a]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Nephron segment metabolism and physiology

Each nephron segment has distinct physiological characteristics, and substrate utilization and metabolic pathway activities vary substantially between nephron segments and are generally consistent with oxygen availability (Fig. 1C). In regions where PO 2 is high, nephrons use primarily oxidative phosphorylation to produce ATP, whereas segments where PO 2 is low rely mainly on glycolysis. However, the current understanding of nephron segmental metabolism is mainly based on studies that measured specific substrate utilization, ATP production, and abundance or activities of a small number of metabolic enzymes in nephron segments isolated from rats, mice, and other animal models –. One should be cautious with extrapolating these findings to nephron segmental metabolism in vivo because metabolism is highly dynamic and dependent on the cellular milieu and anatomical context.

The proximal tubule reabsorbs ~65% of the filtered NaCl and water and nearly all filtered glucose and amino acids. Part of this reabsorption may occur passively through the paracellular space. Na + /K + -ATPase activity per unit length of the tubule segment and mitochondrial density and enzyme abundance in the proximal tubule are lower than or similar to the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle and the distal convoluted tubule, but higher than other nephron segments. Free fatty acids appear to be a significant energy source for the proximal tubule (Fig. 1C). Other substances that the proximal tubule may use as fuel include glutamine, lactate, and ketone bodies –. The proximal tubule has significant gluconeogenetic capabilities –. Gluconeogenesis may compete with Na + /K + -ATPase for ATP in the proximal tubule.

The thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle reabsorbs 20–25% of the filtered NaCl without reabsorbing water. Glucose may be the primary energy source in thick ascending limb, even though lactate, fatty acids, and ketone bodies may also contribute. Glycolytic capabilities are present in the thick ascending limb and subsequent nephron segments and largely absent in the proximal tubule –. The thin descending and ascending limbs of the loop of Henle do not have significant active transport.

The distal convoluted tubule and the collecting duct reabsorb 5–10% of the filtered sodium and are the final segments that may control sodium excretion and urine flow rate. Substrate utilization in the cortical collecting duct is qualitatively similar to the thick ascending limb –. The importance of glucose as the main energy source appears to increase, and that of fatty acids decreases, as the collecting duct progresses to the renal inner medulla region.

### Effects of ATRAP in renal proximal tubules on angiotensin-dependent hypertension [^9d034086]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Endogenous ATRAP is highly expressed in proximal tubules, with one question being the in vivo functional role of proximal tubule ATRAP. In this regard, we have recently shown that ATRAP plays an important role in inhibiting kidney aging, possibly through a SIRT1 (sirtuin 1)–mediated mechanism independent of blocking Ang II–AT1R signaling, which further protects normal lifespan. 34 Compared with WT mice, systemic ATRAP KO mice show more advanced age–associated mitochondrial abnormalities and subsequently increased reactive oxygen species production in proximal tubules of the kidney, as well as exacerbated age‐associated tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Consequently, further studies are needed to investigate the functional role of proximal tubule ATRAP in kidney aging using PT‐KO mice.

This study has some limitations. First, we could not exclude the possibility of functional compensation in the mechanism due to embryonic silencing of the gene. Some gene deletions show no phenotypic changes because of functional compensation by closely related or duplicate genes. Functional compensation is also attributed to alternative metabolic pathways or regulatory networks. 35 Further studies are needed to exclude the possibility of functional compensation for the deletion of ATRAP in proximal tubules. Second, because of the statistical design, the results of this study do not unequivocally prove that ATRAP deficiency in the proximal nephron does not affect angiotensin‐dependent hypertension. However, considering the results of our previous studies using systemic ATRAP KO mice and renal tubule–dominant ATRAP transgenic mice, 15, 18 ATRAP in the proximal tubules is not likely to play a major role in angiotensin‐dependent hypertension. In conclusion, ATRAP deficiency in the proximal nephron does not obviously enhance angiotensin‐mediated hypertension in vivo.

### Effects of ATRAP in renal proximal tubules on angiotensin-dependent hypertension [^14ff6315]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Regarding the regulatory role of renal proximal tubule AT1R in physiological and pathophysiological BP regulation, Gurley et al reported that proximal tubule–specific AT1R deficiency reduces baseline BP and further suppresses BP elevation in response to chronic Ang II infusion. In their study, they used proximal tubule‐specific AT1R‐deficient mice that were generated by the Cre/loxP system using PEPCK ‐Cre. 17 In contrast, using another line of proximal tubule‐specific AT1R‐deleted mice, Li et al showed that proximal tubule–specific AT1R deficiency reduces baseline BP but does not affect the pressor response to chronic Ang II infusion. 26 These controversial results indicate that pathophysiology of BP elevation in response to chronic Ang II infusion is not exclusively mediated through the mechanism of AT1R activation in proximal nephrons.

In addition, a previous study reported that chronic Ang II stimulation does not affect proximal tubule fluid reabsorption or sodium delivery to distal nephron segments but rather that sodium reabsorption was increased in distal nephron segments by dual distal nephron blockade with amiloride and bendroflumethiazide in Ang II–infused mice. 27 Hashimoto et al also observed that disruption of tissue angiotensin‐converting enzyme did not alter proximal tubule fluid reabsorption, as assessed by a micropuncture technique in a tissue‐specific angiotensin‐converting enzyme KO model. 28 These results suggest that distal, but not proximal, nephron segments play a critical role in AT1R signal‐mediated renal sodium reabsorption and BP regulation, at least under in vivo conditions of chronic Ang II stimulation. This may be one of the reasons why ATRAP deficiency in proximal nephrons does not obviously affect the pressor response to Ang II.

Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) — Prolonged warm ischemia followed by reperfusion in mammalian kidneys produces extensive necrosis destroying the proximal tubules of the outer stripe of the medulla, with proximal convoluted tubules becoming necrotic as well, while distal nephron involvement is minimal unless medullary oxygenation is specifically targeted. Although these animals develop severe ARF, not much else resembles the clinical syndrome in humans, and the term "acute tubular necrosis" does not accurately reflect the morphological changes in this condition.

### Loss of proximal tubular transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 15 exacerbates kidney injury through loss of fatty acid oxidation [^88ceb258]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

Loss of fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) in the proximal tubule is a critical mediator of acute kidney injury and eventual fibrosis. However, transcriptional mediators of FAO in proximal tubule injury remain understudied. Krüppel-like factor 15 (KLF15), a highly enriched zinc-finger transcription factor in the proximal tubule, was significantly reduced in proximal tubule cells after aristolochic acid I (AAI) treatment, a proximal tubule-specific injury model. Proximal tubule specific knockout of Klf15 exacerbated proximal tubule injury and kidney function decline compared to control mice during the active phase of AAI treatment, and after ischemia-reperfusion injury. Furthermore, along with worsening proximal tubule injury and kidney function decline, knockout mice exhibited increased kidney fibrosis as compared to control mice during the remodeling phase after AAI treatment. RNA-sequencing of kidney cortex demonstrated increased transcripts involved in immune system and integrin signaling pathways and decreased transcripts encompassing metabolic pathways, specifically FAO, and PPARα signaling, in knockout versus control mice after AAI treatment. In silico and experimental chromatin immunoprecipitation studies collectively demonstrated that KLF15 occupied the promoter region of key FAO genes, CPT1A and ACAA2, in close proximity to transcription factor PPARα binding sites. While the loss of Klf15 reduced the expression of Cpt1a and Acaa2 and led to compromised FAO, induction of KLF15 partially rescued loss of FAO in AAI-treated cells. Klf15, Ppara, Cpt1a, and Acaa2 expression was also decreased in other mouse kidney injury models. Tubulointerstitial KLF15 independently correlated with eGFR, PPARA and CPT1A appearance in expression arrays from human kidney biopsies. Thus, proximal tubule-specific loss of Klf15 exacerbates acute kidney injury and fibrosis, likely due to loss of interaction with PPARα leading to loss of FAO gene transcription.

### Exploring the origin and limitations of kidney regeneration [^3f18e198]. The Journal of Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Epidemiological findings indicate that acute kidney injury (AKI) increases the risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD), although the molecular mechanism remains unclear. Genetic fate mapping demonstrated that nephrons, functional units in the kidney, are repaired by surviving nephrons after AKI. However, the cell population that repairs damaged nephrons and their repair capacity limitations remain controversial. To answer these questions, we generated a new transgenic mouse strain in which mature proximal tubules, the segment predominantly damaged during AKI, could be genetically labelled at desired time points. Using this strain, massive proliferation of mature proximal tubules is observed during repair, with no dilution of the genetic label after the repair process, demonstrating that proximal tubules are repaired mainly by their own proliferation. Furthermore, acute tubular injury caused significant shortening of proximal tubules associated with interstitial fibrosis, suggesting that proximal tubules have a limited capacity to repair. Understanding the mechanism of this limitation might clarify the mechanism of the AKI-to-CKD continuum.

### The calcium sensing receptor modulates fluid reabsorption and acid secretion in the proximal tubule [^95ef7c9c]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

The proximal tubule uses a complex process of apical acid secretion and basolateral bicarbonate absorption to regulate both luminal acidification and fluid absorption. One of the primary regulators of apical acid secretion is the luminal sodium-hydrogen exchanger expressed along the apical membrane of the proximal tubule. Similarly, the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is also located along the luminal membrane of the proximal tubule. Here we investigated the role of CaSR in proton secretion and fluid reabsorption in proximal tubules by modulating luminal calcium concentration, using both in vivo micropuncture in rats and in vitro perfused mouse proximal tubules. Using CaSR knockout mice and a calcimimetic agent, we found that increased proton secretion and fluid reabsorption were CaSR dependent. Activating CaSR by either raising the luminal calcium ion concentration or by the calcimimetic caused a concomitant increase in sodium-dependent proton extrusion and fluid reabsorption, whereas in proximal tubules isolated from CaSR knockout mice varying calcium ion concentration had no effect. Application of a calcimimetic in lower concentrations of calcium ion stimulated these processes in vitro and in vivo. Thus, in both rats and mice, increased luminal calcium concentration leads to enhanced fluid reabsorption in the proximal tubule, a process related to activation of CaSR.

### Single cell derived mRNA signals across human kidney tumors [^e86ba53f]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

As cancer cells evolve from normal cells, they may retain patterns of messenger RNA (mRNA) characteristic of the cell of origin. In such cases, the cancer cell transcriptome may contain information that can identify the cancer cell of origin, its differentiation state, or trajectory towards a cancer cell. It is therefore conceivable that tumor transcriptomes can be used to identify the cells from which tumors arise and test fundamental hypotheses regarding tumor's differentiation states, such as the "fetalness" of childhood tumors or the dedifferentiation of adult tumors towards a fetal state.

Single cell transcriptomics allows for a direct quantitative comparison to be made between single tumor and relevant normal cell transcriptomes. For example, single cell transcriptomes identified that a specific subtype of proximal tubular cells are the normal cell correlate of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cells. Such experiments can also reveal more precise information about normal cells within the tumor microenvironment. However, the high resource requirements of single cell transcriptomics preclude investigations of large patient cohorts, which are required to study rare subtypes, test the generalizability of such signals and determine associations with clinical parameters. An alternative approach is to identify the presence of single cell derived mRNA signals in bulk tumor transcriptomes, utilizing normal single cell transcriptomes as a reference. Smaller numbers of single cancer cell experiments can then be used to validate cellular signals identified.

### Flow stimulated endocytosis in the proximal tubule [^f154936a]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The proximal tubule plays a critical role in the reabsorption of ions, solutes and low molecular weight proteins from the glomerular filtrate. Although the proximal tubule has long been known to acutely modulate ion reabsorption in response to changes in flow rates of the glomerular filtrate, it has only recently been discovered that proximal tubule cells can similarly adjust endocytic capacity in response to flow. This review synthesizes our current understanding of mechanosensitive regulation of endocytic capacity in proximal tubule epithelia and highlights areas of opportunity for future investigations.

Recent Findings

Recent studies have reported that the endocytic capacity of proximal tubule cells is dramatically increased upon exposure to flow and the accompanying fluid shear stress. Modulation of this pathway is dependent on increases in intracellular calcium initiated by bending of the primary cilium, and also requires purinergic receptor activation that is mediated by release of extracellular ATP. This article summarizes what is currently known about the signaling cascade that transduces changes in flow into alterations in endocytosis. We discuss the implications of this newly described regulatory pathway with respect to our understanding of protein retrieval by the kidney under normal conditions, and in diseases that present with low molecular weight proteinuria.

Summary

Primary cilia act as mechanotransducers that modulate apical endocytic capacity in proximal tubule cells in response to changes in fluid shear stress.

### The biology of epithelial cell tight junctions in the kidney [^5e7a907c]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Nearly 50 years have lapsed since the tight junction between epithelial cells was first identified by electron microscopy. The tight junction was once viewed as a static structure providing a barrier to paracellular movement and restricting proteins to the apical or basolateral membrane. Recent insights into the molecular composition of tight junctions reveal surprising complexity and dynamic regulation. Epithelia along the nephron exemplify a diversity of tight junctions that contribute to more than a 100-fold difference in permeability from the proximal tubule to the collecting duct. Tight junctions along the nephron form during kidney development and must reassemble after tubular injury. Hereditary diseases, animal models, and cell culture studies provide a variety of new perspectives on the function of tight junctions in health and disease.

Distinct COOs for cancers with different histologies

Beyond displaying cell subset granularity, SCOOP also identified histological cancer subtypes with different COOs. We first examined three subtypes of kidney renal cell carcinoma (RCC): clear cell RCC (ccRCC), papillary RCC (pRCC), and chromophobe RCC (chRCC). Both ccRCC and pRCC are thought to originate from the proximal tubule in the kidney, while it is suspected that chRCC originates from the distal tubule. SCOOP predicted proximal tubule progenitor-like (PTPL) cells as the ccRCC and pRCC COO and collecting duct, intercalated cell type A (ICA) from the distal tubule as the chRCC COO, confirming prior work while again demonstrating cell subset granularity in its prediction (Fig. 3a; Supplementary Fig. 5 when training with cell features across tissues). In agreement, individual patient somatic mutation profiles demonstrate higher similarity between ccRCC and pRCC in comparison to chRCC (Fig. 3b).

### Proximal tubule-derived amphiregulin amplifies and integrates profibrotic EGF receptor signals in kidney fibrosis [^cd030610]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Sustained activation of EGF receptor (EGFR) in proximal tubule cells is a hallmark of progressive kidney fibrosis after AKI and in CKD. However, the molecular mechanisms and particular EGFR ligands involved are unknown.

Methods

We studied EGFR activation in proximal tubule cells and primary tubular cells isolated from injured kidneys in vitro. To determine in vivo the role of amphiregulin, a low-affinity EGFR ligand that is highly upregulated with injury, we used ischemia-reperfusion injury or unilateral ureteral obstruction in mice with proximal tubule cell-specific knockout of amphiregulin. We also injected soluble amphiregulin into knockout mice with proximal tubule cell-specific deletion of amphiregulin's releasing enzyme, the transmembrane cell-surface metalloprotease, a disintegrin and metalloprotease-17 (ADAM17), and into ADAM17 hypomorphic mice.

Results

Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1)-dependent upregulation of amphiregulin transcript and protein amplifies amphiregulin signaling in a positive feedback loop. YAP1 also integrates signals of other moderately injury-upregulated, low-affinity EGFR ligands (epiregulin, epigen, TGF α), which also require soluble amphiregulin and YAP1 to induce sustained EGFR activation in proximal tubule cells in vitro. In vivo, soluble amphiregulin injection sufficed to reverse protection from fibrosis after ischemia-reperfusion injury in ADAM17 hypomorphic mice; injected soluble amphiregulin also reversed the corresponding protective proximal tubule cell phenotype in injured proximal tubule cell-specific ADAM17 knockout mice. Moreover, the finding that proximal tubule cell-specific amphiregulin knockout mice were protected from fibrosis after ischemia-reperfusion injury or unilateral ureteral obstruction demonstrates that amphiregulin was necessary for the development of fibrosis.

Conclusions

Our results identify amphiregulin as a key player in injury-induced kidney fibrosis and suggest therapeutic or diagnostic applications of soluble amphiregulin in kidney disease.

### Activation of HIF2 α in kidney proximal tubule cells causes abnormal glycogen deposition but not tumorigenesis [^c5d9ea95]. Cancer Research (2013). Low credibility.

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common primary cancer arising from the kidney in adults, with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) representing approximately 75% of all RCCs. Increased expression of the hypoxia-induced factors-1α (HIF1α) and HIF2α has been suggested as a pivotal step in ccRCC carcinogenesis, but this has not been thoroughly tested. Here, we report that expression of a constitutively activated form of HIF2α (P405A, P530A, and N851A, named as HIF2αM3) in the proximal tubules of mice is not sufficient to promote ccRCC by itself, nor does it enhance HIF1αM3 oncogenesis when coexpressed with constitutively active HIF1αM3. Neoplastic transformation in kidneys was not detected at up to 33 months of age, nor was increased expression of Ki67 (MKI67), γH2AX (H2AFX), or CD70 observed. Furthermore, the genome-wide transcriptome of the transgenic kidneys does not resemble human ccRCC. We conclude that a constitutively active HIF2α is not sufficient to cause neoplastic transformation of proximal tubules, arguing against the idea that HIF2α activation is critical for ccRCC tumorigenesis.

### Targeted disruption of a proximal tubule-specific TMEM174 gene in mice causes hyperphosphatemia and vascular calcification [^d9bd0ab6]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The proximal tubules play a critical role in phosphate (Pi) homeostasis by reabsorbing Pi via sodium-dependent Pi cotransporters. NPT2A is a major proximal-specific Pi cotransporter, whose expression is regulated by circulating hormones, such as parathyroid hormone (PTH) and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). In this study, we aimed to find a novel regulator in Pi homeostasis.

Methods

Using RNA-seq and RT-qPCR analysis, we identified proximal tubule cell-enriched genes. We next used RNAi screening of the identified proximal tubular cell-enriched genes to identify a novel proximal tubule-specific gene that contributes to FGF23- and PTH-mediated inhibition of Pi uptake and NPT2 reduction. We created mice lacking this novel regulator of Pi homeostasis to examine whether the novel regulator contributes to Pi homeostasis in vivo.

Results

We identified 54 kidney-enriched genes, 19 of which are expressed in renal primary proximal tubule cells. One of the proximal tubule-specific genes, TMEM174, interacted with NPT2A, and its knockdown blocked the reduction of NPT2A protein by FGF23 and PTH treatments in human and opossum proximal tubule cells. TMEM174 KO mice had significantly increased levels of serum Pi, FGF23, and PTH, resulting in vascular calcification.

Conclusions

TMEM174 is a novel regulator of Pi homeostasis that interacts with NPT2A.

A total of 200 ng of recombinant human (h) IL-6 was added to media with and without freshly isolated proximal tubules after 20 minutes of either normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Media human IL-6 concentration was determined after five minutes of incubation. Human IL-6 was significantly reduced in the media containing normoxic proximal tubules versus normoxic and hypoxic media without proximal tubules (✱ p < 0.02, n = 5 to 6). Media human IL-6 was higher in hypoxic proximal tubules versus normoxic proximal tubules († P = 0.05, n = 6).

To determine if hIL-6 is resorbed by renal proximal tubules and remains intact, hIL-6 was measured in the proximal tubule pellets after centrifugation. hIL-6 (pg) was 18 ± 3 in normoxic proximal tubules and was 8 ± 1 in hypoxic proximal tubules (P < 0.01, n = 5 to 6). Since very little intact hIL-6 was contained in renal proximal tubules, these data demonstrate that hIL-6 is degraded in the presence of renal proximal tubules and that hypoxic proximal tubules are less able to metabolize hIL-6 than normoxic proximal tubules.

### Low potassium activation of proximal mTOR / AKT signaling is mediated by kir4.2 [^012ccb92]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The renal epithelium is sensitive to changes in blood potassium (K +). We identify the basolateral K + channel, Kir4.2, as a mediator of the proximal tubule response to K + deficiency. Mice lacking Kir4.2 have a compensated baseline phenotype whereby they increase their distal transport burden to maintain homeostasis. Upon dietary K + depletion, knockout animals decompensate as evidenced by increased urinary K + excretion and development of a proximal renal tubular acidosis. Potassium wasting is not proximal in origin but is caused by higher ENaC activity and depends upon increased distal sodium delivery. Three-dimensional imaging reveals Kir4.2 knockouts fail to undergo proximal tubule expansion, while the distal convoluted tubule response is exaggerated. AKT signaling mediates the dietary K + response, which is blunted in Kir4.2 knockouts. Lastly, we demonstrate in isolated tubules that AKT phosphorylation in response to low K + depends upon mTORC2 activation by secondary changes in Cl - transport. Data support a proximal role for cell Cl - which, as it does along the distal nephron, responds to K + changes to activate kinase signaling.

SGLT2 inhibitors — mechanism of action and systemic effects — act by blocking the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) in the proximal tubule, which is responsible for approximately 90% of urinary glucose reabsorption; inhibition lowers glucose via glucosuria that is more pronounced with hyperglycemia, diminishes as blood glucose normalizes, and is smaller as eGFR decreases. The risk of hypoglycemia is extremely low unless combined with insulin or insulin secretagogues, and beyond glycemia these agents cause diuretic and natriuretic effects, promote weight loss, and lower systolic blood pressure. Proposed contributors to cardiovascular and renal benefit include reductions in preload and afterload through diuresis, alterations in myocardial metabolism, and prevention of myocardial fibrosis.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, ertugliflozin) cause glucosuria by inhibiting reabsorption of filtered glucose in the proximal tubule and can result in some weight loss in T2DM, with trials of 12–52 weeks using dapagliflozin and canagliflozin showing weight loss of 2–3 kg and a meta-analysis demonstrating an MD at two years compared to placebo of −2.99 kg (95% CI: −3.64 to −2.34); warnings include ketoacidosis, genital mycotic infections, and rare necrotizing fasciitis, there remains a boxed warning for canagliflozin in the setting of foot ulcers or amputations, and renal function should be monitored with use.

### The lipid 5-phoshatase SHIP2 controls renal brush border ultrastructure and function by regulating the activation of ERM proteins [^43ca6e0a]. Kidney International (2017). Low credibility.

The microvillus brush border on the renal proximal tubule epithelium allows the controlled reabsorption of solutes that are filtered through the glomerulus and thus participates in general body homeostasis. Here, using the lipid 5-phosphatase Ship2 global knockout mice, proximal tubule-specific Ship2 knockout mice, and a proximal tubule cell model in which SHIP2 is inactivated, we show that SHIP2 is a negative regulator of microvilli formation, thereby controlling solute reabsorption by the proximal tubule. We found increased PtdIns(4,5)P2 substrate and decreased PtdIns4P product when SHIP2 was inactivated, associated with hyperactivated ezrin/radixin/moesin proteins and increased Rho-GTP. Thus, inactivation of SHIP2 leads to increased microvilli formation and solute reabsorption by the renal proximal tubule. This may represent an innovative therapeutic target for renal Fanconi syndrome characterized by decreased reabsorption of solutes by this nephron segment.

### Efficient and precise single-cell reference atlas mapping with symphony [^ce47b84f]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Symphony maps tumor-derived cells onto a healthy atlas

Given that Symphony maps unseen query cells to their most similar reference type, we hypothesized that Symphony may be able to map tumor-derived cells onto an atlas of corresponding healthy tissue. As an exploratory analysis, we built a reference (= 27,203 cells) of healthy fetal kidneyand mapped a renal cell carcinoma (RCC) dataset (= 34,326 cells), transferring reference cell type labels to the query using 10-NN and comparing the predicted labels to the original annotations from Bi et al. (Methods, Fig. 6). As a sanity check, we observed excellent correspondence between the original and predicted annotations for immune and stromal cell types (Fig. 6c). We next examined the mapping results for the cells from the three tumor programs (TP1, TP2, and Cycling Tumor) originally defined by Bi et al. We found that TP1 and TP2 both primarily mapped to the reference "Proximal tubule" cell type and its direct precursor ("Medial S shaped body"); Cycling Tumor primarily mapped to "Medial S shaped body", "Proximal tubule", and "Proliferating distal renal vesicle", concordant with a more actively proliferating phenotype (Fig. 6d). These results are consistent with prior literature, as RCC has been thought to arise from proximal tubule cells. Compared to the immune/stromal compartments, the tumor cells exhibited higher per-cell mapping metrics, indicating that they are less well-represented by the reference (Fig. 6e). This example demonstrates how intentionally mapping novel cell types, such as cancer cells onto a healthy atlas, can potentially provide biologically informative results.

### Mechanistic insights into the primary and secondary alterations of renal ion and water transport in the distal nephron [^a159164d]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Alterations of ion transport systems in PC (Fig. 5) or IC (Fig. 6) of the CD are at the origin of many different diseases having global repercussions on the organism by inducing modifications of electrolyte balances (Table 1). These last decades, effort has mainly been focused on the identifications of the dysfunctional components of the ion transport system, with a lot of success, as reviewed above. To better understand the mechanisms of theses tubulopathies and the diversity of symptoms that are, in many circumstances, not related to the genotype, we believe that further investigations should now be orientated toward the analysis of the consequences of these primary or secondary perturbations. To understand how these dysfunctions of the ion transport systems impact the cell physiology, its metabolism, and its proliferative rates, how they induce ER or oxidative stresses and how they evolve in time may be an interesting field of research to better characterize and manage these tubulopathies.

### Does membrane trafficking play a role in regulating the sodium / hydrogen exchanger isoform 3 in the proximal tubule? [^6108d079]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The proximal tubule sodium/hydrogen exchanger continuously reabsorbs the bulk of the filtered sodium, controlling salt delivery to the distal nephron which is critical for tubuloglomerular feedback autoregulation and for fine control of salt excretion in the distal nephron. This review focuses on recent studies of the mechanisms of regulation of sodium transport in the proximal tubule, and addresses whether results from studies in proximal tubule cell lines are applicable to the proximal tubule in situ.

Recent Findings

Recent in-vivo studies provided evidence that sodium/hydrogen exchanger isoform 3 can move into and out of the apical microvilli accompanied by parallel changes in renal sodium transport: the exchanger is retracted from the microvilli in response to hypertension, parathyroid hormone or dopamine treatment and moved into the microvilli in response to sympathetic nervous system stimulation, puromycin aminonucleoside induced nephritic syndrome, and insulin treatment. Studies in cultured opossum kidney proximal tubule cells provided evidence for clathrin coated vesicle mediated, dynamin dependent, cytoskeleton dependent internalization of sodium/hydrogen exchanger isoform 3 from the surface to an endosomal pool in response to dopamine or parathyroid hormone. In the intact proximal tubule there is evidence for a two-step internalization process: (1) from villi to the intermicrovillar cleft region and (2) to a higher density membrane pool that may be either below the microvilli or deep in intermicrovillar clefts. Recent studies have described a significant inactive pool of the exchanger in the intermicrovillar region in vivo that may serve as a storage and recruitable pool.

Summary

The molecular mechanisms responsible for increasing or decreasing sodium transport in the proximal tubule appear to include redistribution of sodium/hydrogen exchanger isoform 3 to or from the microvillar region. Detailed studies in cultured proximal tubule cell lines provide evidence for endocytosis and exocytosis of the exchanger dependent on cytoskeleton and clathrin coated vesicles. In vivo, the apical membrane is differentiated into discrete villar and intermicrovillar membrane domains and the intermicrovillar domain, not observed in cultured cells, may serve as a recruitable storage pool for sodium/hydrogen exchanger isoform 3.

### Sirtuin and metabolic kidney disease [^4db2a470]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Renal tubule–glomeruli communication hypothesis and its mediator

These data implied that decreased Sirt1 expression in proximal tubules leads to a decrease in glomerular Sirt1 and subsequent upregulation of glomerular claudin-1. It was thought that the release of an unknown mediator from proximal tubules affected Sirt1 expression in podocytes and glomeruli. The authorsnamed such a potential retrograde functional association between proximal tubules and glomeruli as 'renal tubule–glomeruli communication' (Figure 3). In in vitro experiment, conditioned medium obtained from proximal tubule cells cultured with high glucose medium led to significant suppression of Sirt1 and upregulation of claudin-1 in cultured podocytes. This result suggested that there was a humoral factor secreted from proximal tubule cells that regulated Sirt1 and claudin-1 expressions in podocytes. NMN is an intermediary metabolite of nicotinic acid metabolism (Figure 1), and its generation decreases when Sirt1 activity decreases. In the previous report, NMN is secreted from perivascular adipose tissue and alters vascular smooth muscle cell morphology, suggesting its function as a mediator for cell-to-cell interaction. In proximal tubule cells, NMN decreased when cells were cultured with high glucose. Addition of NMN to the conditioned medium obtained from proximal tubule cells cultured with high glucose medium restored Sirt1 expression and reduced claudin-1 expression in podocytes. Fluorescence staining for NMN showed that the intracellular NMN level decreased in proximal tubule cells cultured with high glucose. The NMN level also decreased in the kidney of STZ-administered diabetic mice, and did not change in transgenic mice. Intrarenal administration of fluorescent-labeled NMN showed NMN first accumulated mainly in the renal tubule 1 h after administration, and was subsequently transferred to glomeruli 2–4 h after administration.

These sets of experiments provide the evidence for NMN as a mediator of renal tubule–glomeruli communication. Similar events are not detected in the 5/6 renal ablation model, suggesting that hyperglycemic stimulation is important in the pathological process. Consistently, in this study, essential parts of the results in STZ-induced diabetic mice were reproduced not only in obese-type diabetic db/db mice but also in the db/db mice crossed with proximal tubule–specific Sirt1 transgenic mice. Moreover, the phenotypes observed in diabetic mice were reproduced in tissue culture systems using proximal tubular cell line, HK-2 cell, and primary podocytes exposed to high glucose. The phenotypes in STZ-treated mice in this study are primarily due to diabetic condition, but not to STZ-induced nephrotoxicity.

### Altered cholesterol localization and caveolin expression during the evolution of acute renal failure [^9467843f]. Kidney International (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Renal cortical/proximal tubule cholesterol accumulation, with preferential localization within plasma membrane "detergent resistant microdomains" (DRMs: rafts/caveolae), is a hallmark of the maintenance phase of acute renal failure (ARF). This study addressed two related issues: (1) Are maintenance-phase cholesterol increases accompanied by an up-regulation of caveolin, a DRM/caveolar-associated cholesterol binding protein? (2) Is DRM cholesterol/caveolin homeostasis acutely altered during the induction phase of ARF?

Methods

Mouse kidneys were subjected to ischemia ± reperfusion (I/R) followed by assessment of cholesterol DRM partitioning. Acute cell injury effects on potential caveolin release from isolated proximal tubules or into urine also were assessed. Finally, renal cortical/isolated proximal tubule caveolin levels were determined 18 hours after I/R or myoglobinuric ARF.

Results

Acute ischemia causes a rapid shift of cholesterol into cortical DRMs (> 22%). Cholesterol migration into DRMs also was observed in ATP-depleted cultured proximal tubule (HK-2) cells. Acute hypoxic or toxic tubule injury induced plasma membrane caveolin release (Western blot). By the maintenance phase of ARF, marked renal cortical/proximal tubule caveolin increases resulted.

Conclusions

Acute proximal tubular injury damages caveolar/DRM structures, as determined by cholesterol maldistribution and caveolin release. Post-injury, there is a dramatic up-regulation of renal cortical/proximal tubule caveolin, suggesting an increased caveolar mass. These findings indicate, to our knowledge for the first time, that dysregulation of caveolae/raft microdomain expression is a correlate of, and potential participant in, the induction and maintenance phases of ischemic and toxic forms of experimental ARF.

### Renal collision tumours: three additional case reports [^4def6bb7]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

The origin of the association between different tumour types in collision tumours is unclear. Therefore, different hypotheses have been proposed to explain its histogenesis. First, there may be two distinct cell lines proliferating simultaneously after a common oncogenic stimulus from the microenvironment, thereby causing two tumours with different phenotypes. Second, the first tumour could alter the organ's microenvironment, causing the second tumour to have a different phenotype. Third, common precursor stem cells can differentiate into two different lineages and, therefore, cause two distinct tumours. Lastly, the appearance of two distinct tumours in the same anatomical site could have arisen accidentally after different oncogenic stimuli. In Case 1, the two tumours, CCRCC and PRCC, had a common origin from the proximal tubule cells, thus pointing to the third hypothesis. In contrast, since AML originates from perivascular epithelioid cells different from PRCC, the histogenesis of Case 2 could be attributed to the second or fourth hypothesis. Moreover, since CCRCC originates from proximal tubule cells and CDC originates from distal tubule cells, the histogenesis of Case 3 would be similar to that of Case 2. Therefore, in-depth genomic studies on representative samples of collision tumours are fundamental for the elucidation of the somatic mutations responsible for these renal entities. Knowledge on the histogenesis mechanism of collision tumours can enable the development of targeted therapies for advanced or metastatic tumours.

In conclusion, collision tumours, which are composed of two distinct types of renal cell carcinoma, are rare and are usually discovered accidentally or due to symptoms related to tumour expansion. Histological diagnosis of biopsy specimens is challenging and requires exhaustive sampling of all associated tumour components. As the clinical impact of this entity has not been established due to its rarity, its management is based on standard guidelines for classic renal tumours. The histogenesis of such tumours is controversial, and its prognosis depends on the nucleolar grade and/or stage of the most aggressive component.

### Kidney proximal tubule lipoapoptosis is regulated by fatty acid transporter-2 (FATP2) [^d344100b]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Albuminuria and tubular atrophy are among the highest risks for CKD progression to ESRD. A parsimonious mechanism involves leakage of albumin-bound nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) across the damaged glomerular filtration barrier and subsequent reabsorption by the downstream proximal tubule, causing lipoapoptosis. We sought to identify the apical proximal tubule transporter that mediates NEFA uptake and cytotoxicity. We observed transporter-mediated uptake of fluorescently labeled NEFA in cultured proximal tubule cells and microperfused rat proximal tubules, with greater uptake from the apical surface than from the basolateral surface. Protein and mRNA expression analyses revealed that kidney proximal tubules express transmembrane fatty acid transporter-2 (FATP2), encoded by Slc27a2, but not the other candidate transporters CD36 and free fatty acid receptor 1. Kidney FATP2 localized exclusively to proximal tubule epithelial cells along the apical but not the basolateral membrane. Treatment of mice with lipidated albumin to induce proteinuria caused a decrease in the proportion of tubular epithelial cells and an increase in the proportion of interstitial space in kidneys from wild-type but not Slc27a2- / - mice. Ex vivo microperfusion and in vitro experiments with NEFA-bound albumin at concentrations that mimic apical proximal tubule exposure during glomerular injury revealed significantly reduced NEFA uptake and palmitate-induced apoptosis in microperfused Slc27a2-/- proximal tubules and Slc27a2-/- or FATP2 shRNA-treated proximal tubule cell lines compared with wild-type or scrambled oligonucleotide-treated cells, respectively. We conclude that FATP2 is a major apical proximal tubule NEFA transporter that regulates lipoapoptosis and may be an amenable target for the prevention of CKD progression.

### MTOR activation initiates renal cell carcinoma development by coordinating ERK and p38MAPK [^5940cc86]. Cancer Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) mainly originates from renal proximal tubules. Intriguingly, disruption of genes frequently mutated in human RCC samples thus far has only generated RCC originated from other renal tubule parts in mouse models. This hampers our understanding of the pathogenesis of RCC. Here we show that mTOR signaling, often activated in RCC samples, initiates RCC development from renal proximal tubules. Ablation of Tsc1, encoding an mTOR suppressor, in proximal tubule cells led to multiple precancerous renal cysts. mTOR activation increased MEK1 expression and ERK activation, and Mek1 ablation or inhibition diminished cyst formation in Tsc1 -deficient mice. mTOR activation also increased MKK6 expression and p38MAPK activation, and ablation of the p38α-encoding gene further enhanced cyst formation and led to RCC with clear cell RCC features. Mechanistically, Tsc1 deletion induced p53 and p16 expression in a p38MAPK-dependent manner, and deleting Tsc1 and Trp53 or Cdkn2a (encoding p16) enhanced renal cell carcinogenesis. Thus, mTOR activation in combination with inactivation of the p38MAPK-p53/p16 pathway drives RCC development from renal proximal tubules. Moreover, this study uncovers previously unidentified mechanisms by which mTOR controls cell proliferation and suggests the MEK-ERK axis to be a potential target for treatment of RCC. SIGNIFICANCE: Mouse modeling studies show that mTOR activation in combination with inactivation of the p38MAPK-p53/p16 axis initiates renal cell carcinoma that mimics human disease, identifying potential therapeutic targets for RCC treatment.

### HIF activation identifies early lesions in VHL kidneys: evidence for site-specific tumor suppressor function in the nephron [^07d6a59d]. Cancer Cell (2002). Low credibility.

Mutations in the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene are associated with hereditary and sporadic clear cell renal carcinoma. VHL acts in a ubiquitin ligase complex regulating hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), but the link between this function and cancer development is unclear. Here we show that in the kidneys of patients with VHL disease, HIF activation is an early event occurring in morphologically normal single cells within the renal tubules. In comparison, dysplastic lesions, cystic lesions, and tumors showed evidence of additional mechanisms that amplify HIF activation. Detection of cells with constitutive HIF activation identified a large number of previously unrecognized foci of VHL inactivation. In proximal tubules these were almost entirely unicellular, whereas multicellular foci were almost exclusively seen in the distal nephron.

### Characterizing the tumor suppressor activity of FLCN in birt-hogg-dubésyndrome cell models through transcriptomic and proteomic analysis [^ef5a908a]. Oncogene (2025). Medium credibility.

Although the involvement of FLCN in cell growth control is better understood, it is still not clear how dysregulation of this pathway following FLCN loss could predispose patients to multiple RCC subtypes with different mutational signatures. Therefore, we wanted to further study the tumorigenic mechanisms underlying FLCN loss. To do this, we studied a human kidney proximal tubule (HK2) cell line, as proximal tubule cells in the kidney are considered to be the origin cell in BHD tumor formation. We observed increased tumorigenic properties after long-term knockdown of FLCN in HK2 cells (after they had been cultured for one year), while short-term FLCN knockdown had little ability to transform these cells. We examined the transcriptome profiles of these cells to reveal the enrichment of genes linked to cell cycle control, a tumorigenic feature that became more prominent with long-term loss of FLCN. To better understand the function of FLCN, we then carried out proteomic analysis of FLCN interactors, which were also mapped to multiple cell cycle regulators and included components of the DNA damage machinery. Our findings suggest that alterations in cell cycle control upon FLCN loss enhance cancer progression in patients with BHD.

The distal convoluted tubule is the nephron segment that lies immediately downstream of the macula densa. Although short in length, the distal convoluted tubule plays a critical role in sodium, potassium, and divalent cation homeostasis. Recent genetic and physiologic studies have greatly expanded our understanding of how the distal convoluted tubule regulates these processes at the molecular level. This article provides an update on the distal convoluted tubule, highlighting concepts and pathophysiology relevant to clinical practice.

### Metallothionein isoform 3 and proximal tubule vectorial active transport [^1d6d930c]. Kidney International (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Metallothionein isoform 3 (MT-3) is expressed in the proximal tubule cells of the human kidney. The goal of the present study was to further characterize the basal expression of MT-3 in the proximal tubule and to determine if MT-3 participates in the maintenance of proximal tubule cell function.

Methods

Expression of MT-3 mRNA was determined in the intact proximal tubule using microdissection and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Basal expression of MT-3 mRNA and protein was determined in cultured human proximal tubule (HPT) cells and an immortalized proximal tubular cell line, HK-2 cells, using RT-PCR and immunoblotting. The MT-3 gene was stably transfected into the HK-2 cell line using the pcDNA3.1/Hygro (+) vector.

Results

MT-3 mRNA was detected in the proximal tubule of the in situ kidney with relative expression in excess to that of the beta-actin housekeeping gene. The mortal HPT cells were shown to express both MT-3 mRNA and protein and to form domes, while immortal HK-2 cells were shown to have no expression of MT-3 mRNA and protein nor to form domes. The stable transfection of MT-3 in HK-2 restored MT-3 expression and dome formation to the HK-2 cells.

Conclusions

MT-3 mRNA is present in the human proximal tubule, and MT-3 expression is involved in the transport function of a human renal cell line that retains properties of the proximal tubule.

### Kidney cancer with thyroid metastasis combined with thyroid carcinoma, a case report [^9c391a2e]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a malignant tumor that originates from the inner wall of the proximal tubule. It is the third-most common genitourinary cancer site after prostate and bladder cancer. RCC accounts for approximately 90% of renal tumors, and its pathological types mainly include clear cell carcinoma. Approximately 30% of patients have metastatic disease at the time of RCC diagnosis, and 25% develop metastatic disease following nephrectomy. The most common sites of metastasis are the lungs (75%), followed by the regional lymph nodes (65%), liver (40%), and bone (40%). Thyroid metastasis secondary to RCC rarely occurs. However, RCC is the most common primary tumor in metastatic thyroid cancer. The five-year relative survival for European RCC patients, diagnosed between 2000 and 2007, was 60.6%. This rate was reportedly 72.4% according to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program database from 2004 to 2010. The timing of the onset for thyroid metastasis in RCC is prolonged, and the median time from the diagnosis of RCC to the discovery of thyroid metastasis is estimated to be 8.8 years. Compared to those with other single-site metastases, patients with thyroid metastasis have a better survival after thyroidectomy. Total thyroidectomy was not associated with a better survival than partial thyroidectomy. For the treatment of RCC metastatic to thyroid, the current clinical guidelines do not give clear treatment recommendations. In view of the particularity of this patient, that is, remote metastasis was found by chance eight years after kid surgery, the patient was given Outpatient follow-up after multidisciplinary consultation.

### KidneyNetwork: using kidney-derived gene expression data to predict and prioritize novel genes involved in kidney disease [^b5852041]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Data retrieval and sample clustering

We selected 878 kidney samples (Fig. S 2), which we clustered and plotted using the UMAP algorithm (Fig. 1). Generally, the data clusters into three main clusters: primary non-tumor kidney data, kidney developmental samples and proximal tubule, glomerulus and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) samples.

Fig. 1
UMAP visualization of the kidney-derived expression data.

878 samples group into three main clusters: healthy primary tissue (middle and bottom), developmental samples (left) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) samples (right). On the left side of the figure, clustering of pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived podocytes and PSC-derived organoids with primary fetal samples and nephron progenitor cells can be seen. On the right side, RCC samples cluster close to proximal tubule samples, and the RCC cluster closest to healthy primary tissue samples consists of non-clear cell RCC (nccRCC) samples. In the middle and at the bottom, healthy primary kidney samples cluster based on their tissue of origin.

KidneyNetwork improves gene‒phenotype predictions

First, we updated GeneNetwork with the updated HPO database (Fig. S 6) and optimized the gene network building pipeline (Fig. S 7). These changes yielded an improvement in the general GeneNetwork compared to the previous version (Fig. S 8). We then used the improved pipeline to build the kidney-specific gene regulatory network. As expected, given the small sample size, this version of the kidney-specific network performed less well than GeneNetwork (Fig. S 9). Subsequently, combining GeneNetwork and the kidney specific gene co-expression network into KidneyNetwork yielded our best results for kidney-related HPO-terms (Fig. 2A; Table S5). The prediction AUC, precision, sensitivity and f1-scores for each predicted pathway are provided (Table S6).

### Urine interleukin-6 is an early biomarker of acute kidney injury in children undergoing cardiac surgery [^775910a4]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

To confirm that murine IL-6 is not detected by the human IL-6 ELISA, recombinant murine IL-6 at 1,000, 500, 100, and 65 pg/mL concentrations were assayed with the human ELISA kit and no human IL-6 was detected. Thus, hIL-6 detected in the serum and urine post-injection of hIL-6 is not indicative of endogenous (murine) production of IL-6, but does reflect the metabolism/elimination of circulating IL-6 in AKI.

Addition of recombinant human IL-6 to murine proximal tubules

To directly examine the role of renal proximal tubules in IL-6 metabolism, freshly isolated proximal tubules or media containing 1% BSA were exposed to 20 minutes of normoxia or hypoxia at which time 16.6 ng of recombinant human IL-6 (hIL-6) was added to the media. After five minutes, percent LDH release and media hIL-6 was determined.

The percent of LDH release is a measure of hypoxia-induced membrane injury and increased percent LDH release is an indicator of proximal tubular necrosis (that is, the higher the percent LDH, the higher the degree of proximal tubular membrane disruption). The percent of LDH release was 7 ± 1 in normoxic proximal tubules + hIL-6 and was 36 ± 2 in hypoxic proximal tubules (P < 0.0001, n = 5 to 6). In separate experiments, percent LDH was determined in normoxic and hypoxic proximal tubules without addition of hIL-6 to ensure that the addition of hIL-6 did not have an effect on membrane injury; in these experiments percent LDH release was 11 ± 1 in normoxic proximal tubules (P = NS vs. normoxic proximal tubules + hIL-6, n = 5 to 6) and was 34 ± 4 in hypoxic proximal tubules (P = NS vs. hypoxic proximal tubules + hIL-6). Thus, addition of hIL-6 did not affect hypoxia-induced membrane injury.

### Urine interleukin-6 is an early biomarker of acute kidney injury in children undergoing cardiac surgery [^d56f25eb]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

To test our hypothesis that serum/circulating IL-6 is filtered and remains intact in the urine in AKI with proximal tubule injury, hIL-6 was given intravenously to mice with pre-renal azotemia (renal failure without proximal tubule injury) or ischemic AKI (renal failure with proximal tubule injury) and urine was collected for one hour. The use of hIL-6 in this experiment is advantageous because it is homologous to murine IL-6 and expected to be handled in a similar manner, but it does not cross react with murine IL-6 on the ELISA test used to measure it; thus, potential confounding effects of endogenous murine IL-6 production are avoided. If our hypothesis that circulating IL-6 is filtered by the glomerulus and then resorbed and metabolized by the proximal tubule were correct, then urine hIL-6 would be low in mice with functioning kidneys and high in mice with AKI. Indeed, urine hIL-6 was dramatically increased in ischemic AKI and was reduced in pre-renal azotemia and controls with normal renal function. Finally, to directly examine IL-6 metabolism by proximal tubules, hIL-6 was added to the media of normal and hypoxic isolated proximal tubules and hIL-6 was reduced in the media of normal versus injured hypoxic proximal tubules. Together these data suggest that renal filtration coupled with impaired proximal tubule metabolism of IL-6 contributes to the increase in urine IL-6 observed in AKI.

### Cellular and physical microenvironments regulate the aggressiveness and sunitinib chemosensitivity of clear cell renal cell carcinoma [^e4b7aaaf]. The Journal of Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) mainly originates from the proximal convoluted tubules and accounts for 85% of renal cancer cases in the United States [1]. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a major histological subtype of RCC that is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Forty percent of patients with ccRCC develop tumor metastases, and their 5‐year survival rate is circa 10% [2]. Previous epidemiological studies demonstrated that obesity is a major risk factor for RCC [3, 4]. In addition, elevated body mass index in both men and women and abdominal obesity in women may play an important role in the carcinogenesis and homeostasis of RCC [5, 6, 7].

The microenvironment includes both cellular and physical factors, and it regulates the homeostasis and function of both normal and tumor cells. For example, cell–cell interactions and the surrounding physical stimuli cooperate to form a specific microenvironment. The kidney is surrounded by perirenal adipose tissue (Figure 1A). Macrophage infiltration commonly occurs in many types of tumor, including RCC. Tumor‐surrounding adipose tissue and tumor‐associated macrophages (TAMs) are major components of the RCC cellular microenvironment [8, 9] (Figure 1B). RCC has a highly elaborate microvasculature network that generates interstitial fluid flow, which is the movement of fluid through the extracellular compartments of tissues (Figure 1C). Therefore, from the histopathological viewpoint, adipose tissue, macrophages, and fluid flow all contribute to the RCC microenvironment.

The cortical distal nephron is a heterogenous structure where the fine regulation of electrolyte and water balance takes place. Among the other segments, previous reports have emphasized the importance of the connecting tubule in sodium and potassium renal handling. Kovacikova et al. report that the connecting tubule is also the major segment in electrogenic urinary acidification, thus reinforcing the central role of this segment in overall electrolyte transport.

### Scalable production of uniform and mature organoids in a 3D geometrically-engineered permeable membrane [^5e54e949]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

We further examined the cell-type proportions in each kidney organoid from both AggreWell and UniMat (Supplementary Table 5 and Supplementary Fig. 12). These findings were then juxtaposed with a recently published scRNA-seq dataset for human and mouse nephrons with a focus on core nephron segments such as podocytes, broad proximal tubules (including early proximal tubules), and loop of Henle/distal tubules (Fig. 5d). In the AggreWell samples, podocytes constituted 35.74%, broad proximal tubules 48.58%, and loop of Henle/distal tubules 15.68% (Fig. 5d). This distribution aligns with prior findings using the Morizane protocol, which showed high percentages of podocytes and proximal tubules. Remarkably, kidney organoids from the UniMat exhibited a 4.5-fold decrease in podocytes (7.97%), but higher proportions of broad proximal tubules (60.93%) and loop of Henle/distal tubules (31.10%). These proportions more closely resemble the cellular composition of natural nephrons in both mice, and humans, (Fig. 5d). Significantly, within the broad proximal tubule category, the proportion of early proximal tubules was 18.7% in UniMat, as compared to 62% in AggreWell, highlighting a higher presence of mature proximal tubules in the former. The higher tubule-to-glomerulus ratio observed in UniMat-cultured kidney organoids is strongly associated with enhanced WNT4 expression — a key signaling molecule in kidney development processes such as the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition and nephron formation, (Supplementary Fig. 13). This elevated WNT signaling in the UniMat system is likely driven by the efficient delivery of the WNT agonist CHIR99021 (CHIR) during the critical nephron patterning stage on days 9–11 through the permeable membrane. Beyond nephron cells, there was a noticeable difference in the NPC cluster: AggreWell exhibited a fraction 1.7 times higher than that of UniMat (Fig. 5e). This further demonstrated the enhanced maturity of kidney organoids cultivated on the UniMat platform (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Table 5). Given that tissue structure and function hinge on cellular compositions, these results emphasize the greater in vivo relevance of kidney organoids generated using UniMat.

### Evidence for involvement of nonesterified fatty acid-induced protonophoric uncoupling during mitochondrial dysfunction caused by hypoxia and reoxygenation [^7adbbde5]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Proximal tubules subjected to hypoxia in vitro under conditions relevant to ischaemia in vivo develop an energetic deficit that is not corrected even after full reoxygenation. We have provided evidence that accumulation of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) is the primary reason for this energetic deficit. In this study, we have further investigated the mechanism for the NEFA-induced energetic deficit.

Methods

Mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsi) was measured in digitonin-permeabilized, freshly isolated proximal tubules by safranin O uptake. Addition of the potassium/proton exchanger nigericin enables the determination of the mitochondrial proton motive force (Deltap) and the proton gradient (DeltapH). ATP was measured luminometrically and NEFA colorimetrically.

Results

Tubule ATP content was depleted after hypoxia and recovered incompletely, even after full reoxygenation. Mitochondrial safranin O uptake was decreased in proximal tubules after hypoxia and reoxygenation (H/R). This decrease was attenuated by delipidated bovine serum albumin (dBSA) or citrate. Addition of nigericin increased safranin O uptake of mitochondria in normoxic proximal tubules, but not in proximal tubules after H/R. Addition of dBSA restored the effect of nigericin to increase mitochondrial safranin O uptake. Addition of the NEFA oleate had the same impact on mitochondrial safranin O uptake as subjecting proximal tubules to H/R.

Conclusion

The mechanism of the NEFA-induced energetic deficit in freshly isolated rat proximal tubules induced by H/R is characterized by impaired ATP production after full reoxygenation, impaired recovery of Deltapsi and Deltap, abrogation of DeltapH and sensitivity to citrate, consistent with involvement of the tricarboxylate carrier. The data support the concept that protonophoric uncoupling by NEFA movement on anion carriers plays a critical role in proximal tubule mitochochondrial dysfunction after H/R.

Radiopharmaceutical choice — Radiopharmaceuticals for assessment of renal function and anatomy can be grouped into three broad categories: those filtered by the glomerulus, those primarily secreted by the renal tubules via the organic anion transporter 1, and those retained in the renal tubules via proximal tubule receptor-mediated endocytosis from the glomerular filtrate. Adult and pediatric consensus groups recommend tubular agents (99mTc-MAG3, 99mTc-L, L-ethylenedicysteine, or 123I-orthoiodohippurate) for diuretic renography because tubular tracers are much more efficiently extracted by the kidney than 99mTc-DTPA, making washout easier to evaluate, and because of parenchymal retention, neither 99mTc-glucoheptonate nor 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid is an appropriate tracer for diuretic renography to evaluate suspected obstruction.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Spironolactone and its active metabolites are specific pharmacologic antagonists of aldosterone, acting primarily through competitive binding of receptors at the aldosterone-dependent sodium-potassium exchange site in the distal convoluted renal tubule. Spironolactone causes increased amounts of sodium and water to be excreted, while potassium is retained. Spironolactone acts both as a diuretic and as an antihypertensive drug by this mechanism. It may be given alone or with other diuretic agents that act more proximally in the renal tubule.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Aldosterone antagonist activity: Increased levels of the mineralocorticoid, aldosterone, are present in primary and secondary hyperaldosteronism. Edematous states in which secondary aldosteronism is usually involved include congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome. By competing with aldosterone for receptor sites, Spironolactone provides effective therapy for the edema and ascites in those conditions. Spironolactone counteracts secondary aldosteronism induced by the volume depletion and associated sodium loss caused by active diuretic therapy.

### RASSF1A protein expression and correlation with clinicopathological parameters in renal cell carcinoma [^8bf10225]. BMC Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Results

Expression of RASSF1A protein

The presence of RASSF1A protein in primary tumor specimens and corresponding histologically normal surrounding parenchyma was investigated using immunohistochemical analysis of TMA slides of 318 patients with CC-RCC. Specific immunopositivity for RASSF1A was exclusively observed in the cytoplasm of tumor and normal tubular epithelial cells. Positivity of RASSF1A was found to be significantly decreased in tumoral cells when compared to normal tubular epithelial cells (p < 0.001, paired t-test). In tumors a mean positivity of 19% (median 11%) was detected and 85% of tumors exhibited a RASSF1A labeling index of ≤ 25% (fig. 1 and 2).

Figure 1
Differential expression of RASSF1A in clear cell carcinoma of the kidney. Immunohistochemical analysis of RASSF1A expression in CC-RCC specimens exhibiting < 25% (A) and > 25% (B) labeling index.

Frequency plot of RASSF1A immunopositivity in CC-RCC. Frequency of RASSF1A immunopositivity (% labeling index) as observed in clear cell RCC. In approximately 85% of tumors a RASSF1A positivity of less than 25% was observed.

Considering that most of renal cell carcinomas are assumed to derive from epithelial cells of the proximal tubules labeling of RASSF1A protein both in the proximal and distal tubules of histologically normal materials were separately analyzed for a subgroup of 90 tissue samples. An almost complete staining for epithelial cells of the proximal and distal tubules with labeling index of nearly 100% was observed thus no significant difference of RASSF1A immunopositivity between proximal or distal tubules could be found (p = 0.22).

Tenofovir — observational CKD risk and exposure characteristics: Tenofovir was associated with a 16%–55% relative increase in the incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in large observational studies (sample sizes 6843 to 10 841), corresponding to 2–5 excess CKD cases per 1000 patient‑years. In a case series of tenofovir‑associated acute kidney injury, the average duration of exposure was 11 months (range 1–29 months). Tenofovir was associated with greater GFR declines when combined with atazanavir, amprenavir, or a ritonavir‑boosted protease inhibitor, and after discontinuation for kidney damage, GFR and proximal tubule dysfunction tended to improve during follow‑up but did not always return to baseline.

Cystatin C — an alternative filtration marker — is described as a small protease inhibitor protein produced by all nucleated cells that is filtered at the glomerulus and then completely reabsorbed and degraded by the proximal tubule, and it is not as affected by muscle mass as creatinine. However, cystatin C levels are affected by fat mass (higher in obesity) and may be affected by inflammation, smoking, corticosteroids, or thyroid disease, and testing is becoming more widely available though it currently is more expensive than creatinine. Prior research has found that cystatin C has a more linear association with adverse outcomes while creatinine has a U-shaped relationship, where both very low creatinine levels and high creatinine levels are associated with adverse outcomes.

### Evidence of renal angiomyolipoma neoplastic stem cells arising from renal epithelial cells [^241b2754]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Renal angiomyolipomas (AML) contain an admixture of clonal tumour cells with features of several different mesenchymal lineages, implying the existence of an unidentified AML neoplastic stem cell. Biallelic inactivation of TSC2 or TSC1 is believed to represent the driving event in these tumours. Here we show that TSC2 knockdown transforms senescence-resistant cultured mouse and human renal epithelial cells into neoplastic stem cells that serially propagate renal AML-like tumours in mice. mTOR inhibitory therapy of mouse AML allografts mimics the clinical responses of human renal AMLs. Deletion of Tsc1 in mouse renal epithelia causes differentiation in vivo into cells expressing characteristic AML markers. Human renal AML and a renal AML cell line express proximal tubule markers. We describe the first mouse models of renal AML and provide evidence that these mesenchymal tumours originate from renal proximal tubule epithelial cells, uncovering an unexpected pathological differentiation plasticity of the proximal tubule.

Glucosuria and urinary symptoms — Glucosuria can occur when blood glucose levels are elevated, including in undiagnosed or poorly controlled diabetes mellitus and in those taking sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors for type 2 diabetes mellitus; SGLT2 inhibitors work by blocking glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule, decreasing blood glucose and facilitating urinary excretion. Glucosuria potentially contributes to urinary symptoms via urothelial irritation and osmotic diuresis, and diabetes-related changes in detrusor muscle pathophysiology, neuronal impairment, and urothelial dysfunction, along with hyperglycemia-associated increased thirst and polydipsia, can further drive urinary symptoms.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^5dcf354c]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) renal toxicity in children includes both glomerular and proximal tubular effects with rare severe outcomes and identifiable risk contexts. New-onset renal impairment and worsening renal impairment have been reported in adults and children receiving TDF, and in one study renal toxicity led to the discontinuation of TDF in 6 of 159 (3.7%) children with HIV who were treated with TDF. The main target of TDF nephrotoxicity is the renal proximal tubule, and subclinical renal tubular damage is more common than clinically apparent renal tubular injury. Increased urinary beta-2 microglobulin was identified in 12 of 44 children (27%) on TDF versus 2 of 48 (4%) not treated with TDF. In Gilead Study 352 of 98 participants aged 2 to 12 years (median drug exposure of 104 weeks), four participants were discontinued for renal tubular dysfunction between 84 and 156 weeks on TDF therapy. Although TDF is clearly associated with a decline in glomerular filtration rate, the effect is generally small, severe glomerular toxicity is rare, and irreversible renal failure is quite rare but has been reported. In children, renal dysfunction may be more common when TDF is used with boosted protease inhibitors than with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, plasma tenofovir (TFV) concentrations are higher when TDF is coadministered with boosted protease inhibitors, plasma TFV is the metabolite most closely associated with both glomerular and proximal tubular toxicity, and TAF is associated with a lower risk of renal toxicity than TDF.

### BBOX1 restrains TBK1-mTORC1 oncogenic signaling in clear cell renal cell carcinoma [^abb29a51]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), a metabolic disease originating from renal proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) epithelial cells, remains incompletely understood in terms of its initiating signaling events. Here, we identify γ-butyrobetaine hydroxylase 1 (BBOX1), a key enzyme in carnitine synthesis predominantly expressed in PCT cells, as a tumor suppressor in ccRCC. BBOX1 expression is lost during ccRCC malignant transformation, and its restoration reduces cell viability in physiological medium and inhibits xenograft tumor growth. Transcriptomic analyses reveal that BBOX1 suppresses critical metabolic pathways including mTORC1 signaling and glycolysis in ccRCC. Further, we identify TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) as an essential mediator of mTORC1 and glycolysis activation and as a target of BBOX1-mediated tumor suppression. Mechanistically, BBOX1 disrupts TBK1 activation by preventing its interaction with the upstream activator doublecortin-like kinase 2 (DCLK2). This BBOX1-DCLK2-TBK1 axis unveils an important mechanism in ccRCC metabolic dysregulation and highlights potential therapeutic strategies.

### Epigenetic silencing and CRISPR-mediated reactivation of tight junction protein claudin10b (CLDN10B) in renal cancer [^b5932976]. Clinical Epigenetics (2025). Medium credibility.

CLDN10 gene is represented by two protein coding isoforms, both expressed in kidney (CLDN10A, CLDN10B). The role of splice variants of CLDN10 or the antisense transcript are not part of the present study. Nevertheless, future CLDN10 research should take possible splice variants into account. It was reported that overexpressed CLDN10 splicing isoforms including exon 4 (containing the 4th transmembrane domain) generates proteins localized in the cytoplasmic membrane, while proteins produced from isoforms lacking exon 4 are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, this exon skipping event seems rare in humans, since there is no evidence for exon 4 skipping in publically available human RNA-Seq data. The CLDN10 antisense transcript may add another layer of regulation beyond promoter hypermethylation, to be explored in future studies. We found that CLDN10 hypermethylation only occurs on the B isoform, whereas the A isoform is hypomethylated in PT-ccRCC and conventional/sporadic ccRCC and pRCC. This inverse methylation pattern was also consistent in ccRCC cell lines and identifies renal from other cancer cell lines. It could be speculated that during carcinogenesis CLDN10B becomes hypermethylated and silenced, whereas CLDN10A is hypomethylated and induced expression. It will be interesting to study the functional link between hypermethylation of CLDN10B and how its loss leads to induction of CLDN10A. Further studies will clarify if CLDN10A compensates for CLDN10B loss. Future studies should explore whether our observation is specific to RCCs from the TAL, where CLDN10B is mainly expressed. In chromophobe RCC subtype, which originates from the cortical collecting ducts, we did not observe hypermethylation of CLDN10B, and only partial hypomethylation of the A isoform, which is in line with the predominant CLDN10B expression in the TAL and CLDN10 in proximal tubules. The observation of CLDN10B loss by hypermethylation in ccRCC leads us to speculate on its diverse function in different regions of the kidney tubular system. CLDN10B in the proximal tubule would rather plays a role in maintaining tissue integrity as a tight junction protein connecting neighboring cells. Its loss contributes to ccRCC formation, especially when combined with VHL loss, a key driver of ccRCC. In contrast, CLDN10B expression in the thick ascending limb (TAL) regulates ion selectivity, and its hypermethylation might also impair this function. However, since TAL cells do not typically give rise to ccRCC, this CLDN10B dysfunction in the TAL is unlikely to contribute to tumorigenesis. CLDN10B mutations are clinically significant, causing the rare recessive HELIX syndrome, a type of Claudinopathy. Although HELIX syndrome patients, mostly children and young adults, have not shown increased RCC susceptibility, with only 20 cases reported, it remains unclear whether they may develop RCC later, particularly under immunosuppressive conditions. In renal cancer, mutation of CLDN10 is rare and hypermethylation likely causes a loss of function of the B isoform. Expression analysis of CLDN10 using databases like TCGA (KIRC-ccRCC, KIRP-pRCC) can be misleading, as they do not necessarily distinguish between the A and B isoforms, both of which are expressed in kidney tissue. Nevertheless, and clinically relevant, we and others observed loss of CLDN10 expression is associated with decreased patient survival and advanced tumor staging in ccRCC, irrespective of isoform levels. This was consistent with previous research indicating CLDN10 as a RCC biomarker. Distinguishing between the isoforms is essential to understand the epigenetic silencing of CLDN10B. Clinically, we found that hypermethylation of CpG probes of CLDN10B correlated with reduced survival for ccRCC. CLDN10B hypermethylation extends across its CGI and into regions with high CpG content (shore and shelf), found in primary renal clear cell carcinoma, papillary cell carcinoma, and in PT-ccRCC. CLDN10B expression was restored with pharmacological demethylation (5-Aza-2'deoxycytidine), suggesting its epigenetic regulation as a potential therapeutic target for cancer. We first established its tumor-suppressive role in conventional 2D cell cultures and in 3D cultures in the HEK cell model. Overexpressing CLDN10B in HEK293T was detectable along the cell membrane by immunofluorescence, in line with its tight junction formation. We observed CLDN10B growth suppressive function by reduced wound healing and cell cycle arrest in S phase and in reduced spheroid size in 3D culture. The immortal renal cell line HEK, while a superior model for transfection, is not a perfect representation of renal cancer subtypes. Follow-up studies should therefore include renal cell lines from ccRCC or pRCC to validate CLDN10B's growth-suppressive role. Nevertheless, HEK cells exhibit a similar epigenetic silencing of many tumor suppressor genes, making them a useful model for epigenetic modulation. CLDN10B induction altered the mRNA expression pattern toward GO-terms of 'cell adhesion' and 'extracellular matrix' and the GO-term 'regulation of cell death'. However, it must be mentioned that we did not observe apoptosis induction by subG1 phase in our cell cycle analysis. Plasmid-based overexpression or inducible cell lines often produce high protein levels, which may not accurately reflect tumor suppressors behavior like CLDN10B. Detecting CLDN10B protein is challenging due to non-specific results of commercial antibodies. To study CLDN10B in its natural context, we used an approach based on its endogenous induction and reactivation. We identified putative E-boxes of the CLDN10B promoter that could serve as binding motifs for transcription factors. Using a direct CRISPR-Cas9 approach, we induced CLDN10B by targeting E-boxes, possibly generating indels. We speculate that this is due to the loss of repressive factors, binding to the E-Box that silence CLDN10B. This endogenous CLDN10B induction was associated with distinct proteomic changes indicative of a shift toward cellular polarity, supporting CLDN10B as a regulator of cell polarity or even epithelial organization. Interestingly, the CLDN10B binding partners and their network differ from the proteomic changes observed upon CLDN10B induction. The protein network associated with overexpressed CLDN10B is linked to heat shock protein binding, mitochondrial function, and cellular transport. We identified more co-precipitating partners for CLDN10B than those listed in the IntAct database, with a partial overlap that supports our approach. Although CLDN10B localizes to the membrane, it still interacts with proteins related to mitochondria and cellular transport, consistent with a previous report highlighting a role for CLDN10B in mitochondria. However, we believe that overexpression approaches has its limitations. Overexpressing CLDN10B may identify non-representative partners that do not reflect its natural interactions. We conclude that correct dosing of CLDN10B is crucial for understanding its endogenous function. Overinduction or overexpression may not accurately represent natural levels. Consequently, we prioritized analyzing endogenous levels through our epigenetic editing approach and reversed the epigenetic silencing of CLDN10B to explore its tumor-suppressive function in an endogenous context. However, we observed relevant limitations with the dCas9-TET1 system, particularly due to off-target effects. Overexpression of TET1, even without specific targeting, triggered CLDN10B expression induction, which aligns with our previous findings on TET1 inducing ubiquitous demethylation of other target genes and is furthermore also consistent with other studies on TET use. This effect is likely linked to the activity of TET dioxygenases, which trigger a gradual demethylation process. Consequently, overexpressing TET1 replicates the effects of systemic demethylation treatments, such as Aza, and should therefore be employed sparingly. Our unpublished data demonstrated the specificity of CLDN10 CRISPR-dCas targeting using the guides employed in this study, with no significant off-target effects detected through whole methylome EPIC2 analysis. Additionally, we confirmed that the guides used for CLDN10 targeting do not bind to other genomic sites. Nevertheless, targeting the CLDN10B promoter with VP160 and TET1 in the dCas9 system not only demethylated and reactivated CLDN10B but also restored its tumor-suppressive function in a wound healing assay. VP160 proved more effective, likely due to its additional role as a transcriptional activator, increasing CLDN10B levels strongly. Both our observations and previous reports suggest that dCas9-VP160 has the ability to demethylate genomic regions through steric hindrance of DNMT activity. Given TET1's limited impact on CLDN10B induction and the elevated baseline expression in its presence, we used dCas9-VP160 and demonstrate CLDN10B's tumor-suppressive effects also in the 3D spheroid model. Building on our hypothesis that CLDN10B functions as a tumor suppressor in renal cancer, we now confirm its epigenetic silencing in renal cancer. Our renal cell line study further supports its tumor-suppressive role by demonstrating its growth-inhibitory function. Future studies are underway to further establish its tumor suppressor function in renal cancer. The kidney's tubular system depends on cellular polarity and tight junctions, and disruptions can lead to diseases like kidney cancer. In this study, we discovered that Claudin 10B (CLDN10B) is epigenetically silenced by DNA hypermethylation in renal cancers, including clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), papillary renal carcinoma (pRCC) and post-transplant ccRCC, whereas CLDN10A becomes hypomethylated. The CLDN10B silencing was associated with poor patient survival and advanced tumors. We demonstrated that CLDN10B functions as a tumor suppressor, inhibiting cellular growth. By using a gene-specific CRISPR-based epigenetic editing strategy, we successfully reactivated endogenous CLDN10B, restoring its tumor-suppressive function. Our findings highlight CLDN10B as a promising therapeutic target in renal cancer.

### The SNMMI and EANM practice guideline for renal scintigraphy in adults [^cbcbcbcb]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2018). Medium credibility.

Static renal cortical agents — 99m-Tc-DMSA and 99m-Tc-GH are "mainly bound in the proximal tubule in the renal cortex for a prolonged time after injection" and are suitable for static imaging; 99m-Tc-DMSA is commonly used due to higher retention "(30% vs 5–10% of glucoheptonate)", and because its kidney retention is high, "the radiation dose of DMSA is significant and the administered dose should be chosen with that in mind".

### Na + and K + transport by the renal connecting tubule [^a1a6eff4]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The connecting tubule is emerging as a nephron segment critical to the regulation of Na+ and K+ excretion and the maintenance of homeostasis for these ions. The segment is difficult to study, however, and much of the available information we have concerning its functions is indirect. Here, we review the major transport mechanisms and transporters found in this segment and outline several unsolved problems in the field.

Recent Findings

Recent electrophysiological and immunohistochemical measurements together with theoretical studies provide a more comprehensive view of ion transport in the connecting tubule. New signaling pathways governing Na+ and K+ transport have also been described.

Summary

Key questions about how Na+ and K+ transport are regulated remain unanswered. Is the connecting tubule the site of final regulation of both Na+ and K+ excretion? If so, how are the transport rates of these two ions independently controlled?

### GOLPH2 expression in renal cell cancer [^3acfd12b]. BMC Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Results

GOLPH2 immunostaining was easy to evaluate with the typical cytoplasmic and in most cases perinuclear accentuated staining pattern. In normal renal tissue we detected GOLPH2 with its characteristic fine granular staining pattern more often and with a stronger staining intensity in the distal tubules than in proximal tubules (Figure 1). For 97 cases matching normal renal tissue was evaluated. None of these cases were completely negative for GOLPH2, 8 cases were scored 1+ and 89 cases 2+. Renal glomeruli were often completely negative or displayed only few cells with weak to moderate positivity.

Figure 1
GOLPH2 immunohistochemistry in normal renal tissue. A/B GOLPH2 expression in normal renal tissue with the typical perinuclear granular staining pattern being more prominent in the distal tubules, although occasionally proximal tubules (star) were also strongly positive (A). Staining with Tamm-Horsfall protein in a subsequent tissue section validates the localization of GOLPH2 (B).

Staining intensities of GOLPH2 in RCC were: negative – 29 (27.9%), 1+ – 30 (28.8%), 2+ – 34 (31.5%) and 3+ – 11 (10.6%). GOLPH2 positivity was significantly higher in papillary and chromophobe RCC if compared to clear cell RCC (Table 1, Figure 2). Other associations or correlations (data not shown) with clinico-pathological parameters could not be detected.

### Molecular mechanisms of renal magnesium reabsorption [^5221fbee]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Magnesium is an essential cofactor in many cellular processes, and aberrations in magnesium homeostasis can have life-threatening consequences. The kidney plays a central role in maintaining serum magnesium within a narrow range (0.70–1.10 mmol/L). Along the proximal tubule and thick ascending limb, magnesium reabsorption occurs via paracellular pathways. Members of the claudin family form the magnesium pores in these segments, and also regulate magnesium reabsorption by adjusting the transepithelial voltage that drives it. Along the distal convoluted tubule transcellular reabsorption via heteromeric TRPM6/7 channels predominates, although paracellular reabsorption may also occur. In this segment, the NaCl cotransporter plays a critical role in determining transcellular magnesium reabsorption. Although the general machinery involved in renal magnesium reabsorption has been identified by studying genetic forms of magnesium imbalance, the mechanisms regulating it are poorly understood. This review discusses pathways of renal magnesium reabsorption by different segments of the nephron, emphasizing newer findings that provide insight into regulatory process, and outlining critical unanswered questions.

### Modeling renal cell carcinoma in mice: andInactivation drive tumor grade [^49d3e479]. Cancer Discovery (2017). Low credibility.

Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is characterized by BAP1 and PBRM1 mutations, which are associated with tumors of different grade and prognosis. However, whether BAP1 and PBRM1 loss causes ccRCC and determines tumor grade is unclear. We conditionally targeted Bap1 and Pbrm1 (with Vhl) in the mouse using several Cre drivers. Sglt2 and Villin proximal convoluted tubule drivers failed to cause tumorigenesis, challenging the conventional notion of ccRCC origins. In contrast, targeting with PAX8, a transcription factor frequently overexpressed in ccRCC, led to ccRCC of different grades. Bap1 -deficient tumors were of high grade and showed greater mTORC1 activation than Pbrm1 -deficient tumors, which exhibited longer latency. Disrupting one allele of the mTORC1 negative regulator, Tsc1, in Pbrm1 -deficient kidneys triggered higher grade ccRCC. This study establishes Bap1 and Pbrm1 as lineage-specific drivers of ccRCC and histologic grade, implicates mTORC1 as a tumor grade rheostat, and suggests that ccRCCs arise from Bowman capsule cells. Significance: Determinants of tumor grade and aggressiveness across cancer types are poorly understood. Using ccRCC as a model, we show that Bap1 and Pbrm1 loss drives tumor grade. Furthermore, we show that the conversion from low grade to high grade can be promoted by activation of mTORC1. Cancer Discov; 7(8); 900–17. ©2017 AACR.

### Oncogenic cell tagging and single-cell transcriptomics reveal cell type-specific and time-resolved responses to vhl inactivation in the kidney [^cf93912e]. Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Aside from these findings, single-cell transcriptomic analyses of cells across different renal epithelial cell identities revealed a surprising level of heterogeneity in response to Vhl inactivation. The Vhl 'marking' strategy also enabled us to define changes in the numbers of Vhl -null cells, irrespective of any morphological abnormality. These analyses revealed striking changes over time in the numbers of surviving Vhl -null cells in different regions of the kidney. In the cortex and outer medulla, principally composed of proximal tubules, the number of Vhl -null cells increased substantially. In contrast, a marked decrease in Vhl -null cells was observed in the papilla. This indicated that some renal epithelial populations may be intolerant of Vhl inactivation even in their native context, again potentially contributing to the tissue specificity of VHL -associated oncogenesis.

Based on the absence of neoplastic lesions in unmarked models of Vhl inactivation, it has been assumed that Vhl inactivation has no oncogenic action without inactivating mutations in one or more other genes such as Pbrm1 or Bap1 (,–). These genes reside on human chromosome 3p and are commonly inactivated as part of the initiating chromothripsis event in human RCC and/or subsequently mutated. Nonetheless, the truncal nature of VHL mutation in ccRCC evolution, and the long latency postulated between biallelic VHL inactivation and PBRM1 / BAP1 inactivation suggest that time-accrued effects of VHL inactivation inform the oncogenic trajectory of at least some renal cells. With the caveat that we cannot identify individual cells that are on a certain trajectory to cancer, detailed analysis of marked Vhl -null cells revealed multiple effects of potential relevance to VHL -associated oncogenesis.

Our analyses of Vhl inactivation were focused on two time points: early (1–3 weeks) and late (4–12 months) that were respectively designed to capture early effects of Vhl inactivation such as activation of the HIF transcriptional cascade or track delayed effects. HIF is rapidly activated in hours following loss of VHL-dependent proteolysis and a fully activated HIF transcriptional cascade might be expected in days. Unexpectedly however, although no further interventions were performed, Vhl -null cells manifested marked late changes in gene expression as revealed by analyses at the later time points. These changes did not reflect an obvious gain or loss of amplitude of the HIF transcriptional response but rather reflected two principal changes: reduced expression of proximal tubular differentiation genes and induction of genes involved in lipid metabolism, both of which are observed in VHL -associated ccRCC.

### SNMMI procedure standard / EANM practice guideline on pediatric [99mTc] Tc-DMSA renal cortical scintigraphy: an update [^2ca613ae]. SNMMI (2022). High credibility.

Pediatric [99mTc]Tc-DMSA renal cortical scintigraphy — definitions note that [99mTc]Tc-DMSA is a combination of dimercaptosuccinic acid taken up by the proximal convoluted tubules and technetium-99m, and scanning involves intravenous injection of [99mTc]Tc-DMSA followed by planar imaging using a high-, or ultra-high-resolution collimator, when possible with additional pinhole collimator planar imaging or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).

### Expression of ksp-cadherin during kidney development and in renal cell carcinoma [^590e5151]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

E-cadherin expression is restricted to the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the human kidney, whereas N-cadherin and cadherin-6 expression are found on proximal tubules. Cadherin-8 can only be detected on developing tubular structures. This rather complex pattern of cadherin expression in the normal adult kidney is mirrored by cadherin expression in RCC. More than 70% of all RCCs are clear cell carcinomas that are thought to originate from proximal tubular epithelial cells. Therefore, most of the analysed RCC cell lines synthesised N-cadherin and cadherin-6. Expression of cadherin-6 can serve as a prognostic marker for tumour progression. Some RCC cell lines also express E-cadherin and cadherin-8, but since these cadherins are only found to be expressed on distal tubules or during development, respectively, their expression in the renal tumour cells must be regarded as an aberrant expression pattern.

Although Ksp-cadherin is the only tissue-specific cadherin of the kidney, its expression pattern in RCC has not been studied in detail so far. To analyse Ksp-cadherin expression in the human kidney, reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) analyses of embryonic kidney RNA and immunohistochemistry of embryonic and adult kidneys were performed. The mRNA expression pattern in normal renal tissues and in tumour tissues was compared by in situ hybridisation and by quantitative and qualitative RT–PCR analyses. By immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis, the Ksp-cadherin protein expression of 11 RCC cell lines and of native tumour tissue was analysed and compared to the expression within the normal part of the affected kidneys, since alterations in the expression pattern of Ksp-cadherin may be helpful for early diagnosis of RCC.

### Single-cell chromatin accessibility landscape in kidney identifies additional cell-of-origin in heterogenous papillary renal cell carcinoma [^8bdfa695]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC) is the most heterogenous renal cell carcinoma. Patient survival varies and no effective therapies for advanced pRCC exist. Histological and molecular characterization studies have highlighted the heterogeneity of pRCC tumours. Recent studies identified the proximal tubule (PT) cell as a cell-of-origin for pRCC. However, it remains elusive whether other pRCC subtypes have different cell-of-origin. Here, by obtaining genome-wide chromatin accessibility profiles of normal human kidney cells using single-cell transposase-accessible chromatin-sequencing and comparing the profiles with pRCC samples, we discover that besides PT cells, pRCC can also originate from kidney collecting duct principal cells. We show pRCCs with different cell-of-origin exhibit different molecular characteristics and clinical behaviors. Further, metabolic reprogramming appears to mediate the progression of pRCC to the advanced state. Here, our results suggest that determining cell-of-origin and monitoring origin-dependent metabolism could potentially be useful for early diagnosis and treatment of pRCC.

### Kidney stones and the risk of renal cell carcinoma and upper tract urothelial carcinoma: the Netherlands cohort study [^6609e483]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

There is uncertainty regarding the biological mechanism that may relate kidney stones to kidney cancer. Kidney stones are presumed to cause chronic irritation in the local environment of the kidney and ureter. – In general, chronic irritation and infection recruit inflammatory cells, which secrete cytokines and chemokines. In turn, free radical species from oxygen and nitrogen are produced, facilitating the onset of cancer through, among others, increased cell proliferation. However, more insight on the role of kidney stones in this process is needed to elucidate the found associations.

Chow et al. found that most renal pelvis and ureter cancers occurred on the same side as kidney stone formation, which could indicate that kidney stones are exerting the effect in UTUC. In animal studies, induced stone formation was correlated to the development of bladder cancer. By suppressing stone formation in rats, the effect of kidney stones could be attributed to the irritative stimulation by kidney stones, rather than to metabolites of the stone inducing factor. However, both ccRCC and pRCC are thought to originate from the proximal convoluted renal tubule. It is deemed unlikely that stones or stone-forming crystals deposit in the proximal convoluted renal tubule. Kidney stones tend to form in locations where there is a combination of supersaturation of the urine and where there is a change in the luminal diameter of the renal tubules, such as the loop of Henle, the distal tubules and in the collecting ducts. Therefore, urinary solutes or a predisposing lifestyle, rather than actual stone formation in the kidney, might play a role in the development of these cancer subtypes. In contrast to pRCC, ccRCC risk was not associated with a history of kidney stones in this study. In general, genetic susceptibility and the interaction with environmental exposures are believed to influence RCC risk. Hypothetically, tumour development could be related to the presence of stone-forming salts in the filtrate of the proximal tubules. The presence of these solutes may affect cell metabolism, which could potentially result in the development of distinct renal cancer subtypes.
