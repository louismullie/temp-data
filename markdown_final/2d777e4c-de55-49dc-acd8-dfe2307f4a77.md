what are fordyce spots?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what Fordyce spots are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about a precise definition and common synonyms. Then, I should verify typical clinical morphology and size. Next, I'll review the usual anatomical locations. After that, I need to assess clinical significance and any reported associations. I will then differentiate Fordyce spots from similarly named or commonly confused entities. Finally, I should consider management options, emphasizing when no treatment is needed and when cosmetic therapies might be reasonable.

> Let me first confirm the definition. Fordyce spots, also called Fordyce granules, are ectopic (heterotopic) sebaceous glands — meaning normal sebaceous glands located in sites where sebaceous glands are not typically found, such as oral mucosa and genital skin, and they are benign in nature [^1121SCt5] [^116kN55w] [^113sdkKv] [^117VgNyY].

> I need to verify the core clinical features. Classically, they present as multiple, small, dome-shaped papules that are whitish to yellowish, usually measuring about 1–3 mm, and are typically asymptomatic; they are cosmetically noticeable more than medically significant [^116kN55w]. Wait, let me double-check size ranges — reports commonly cite 1–3 mm, with some noting 2–3 mm, which is consistent across sources and within normal clinical variability [^1121SCt5] [^116kN55w]. Although generally asymptomatic, on genital skin they may occasionally cause pruritus, frictional discomfort, or concern during sexual activity, but they remain benign [^1121SCt5].

> Next, I should review anatomic distribution. The most frequent locations are the oral mucosa (including the vermilion border of the lips and buccal mucosa) and the genital skin in males and females, aligning with the concept of ectopic sebaceous units at mucocutaneous sites [^113sdkKv] [^116kN55w] [^1121SCt5]. I should confirm whether specific intraoral sites are overrepresented — one report in HNPCC carriers emphasized lower gingival and vestibular mucosa, which still fits within the oral-mucosal spectrum of Fordyce granules [^117VgNyY].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about their medical significance. I need to ensure we're clear that Fordyce spots are a common normal variant with no malignant potential or systemic risk; they typically require no treatment beyond reassurance [^112JdZ3p] [^116kN55w]. But wait, what if there are purported associations? A small case–control study suggested a high prevalence of Fordyce granules in families with HNPCC/Lynch syndrome; however, given design limitations and the isolated nature of this finding, it should be interpreted cautiously and not considered a defining or screening marker in routine practice [^117VgNyY].

> I will now examine the differential to avoid mislabeling. First, I should distinguish Fordyce spots from angiokeratomas of Fordyce — despite the similar eponym, angiokeratomas are vascular lesions (blue-to-red papules, often scrotal) that can bleed and are histologically dilated dermal vessels with overlying hyperkeratosis; these are unrelated to sebaceous Fordyce spots and have different management pathways [^115RFM7M]. Hmm, wait a minute — I initially almost borrowed genital site details from angiokeratoma papers to describe Fordyce spots; that would conflate two distinct entities, so I should correct that and keep angiokeratomas separate from ectopic sebaceous Fordyce granules in both description and therapy [^1155pKqR] [^112f4V11]. Second, let me also avoid confusion with Fox-Fordyce disease, which is a pruritic apocrine duct occlusion disorder in axillary/apocrine areas, pathophysiologically distinct from Fordyce spots and managed differently [^111Z6Y4W] [^1177FbAf] [^114FxAKv].

> Now, I need to consider management. I should confirm that no treatment is medically necessary unless for cosmetic or symptomatic reasons, in which case options include: micro‑punch excision for clustered genital lesions, ablative lasers such as superpulsed CO2 for lip lesions, and intralesional or insulated microneedle radiofrequency to minimize surface injury; systemic isotretinoin has shown variable responses for prominent labial Fordyce spots, and any procedural approach should balance efficacy with the risk of scarring or dyspigmentation [^1121SCt5] [^113sdkKv] [^116kN55w] [^112JdZ3p]. Hold on, I should verify recurrence data — micro‑punch series reported no recurrences on follow‑up, but sample sizes are small, so counseling should remain cautious and individualized [^1121SCt5].

> In summary, let me reconsider the core answer to ensure completeness. Fordyce spots (Fordyce granules) are benign ectopic sebaceous glands that present as multiple 1–3 mm whitish‑yellow papules most commonly on the lips/oral mucosa and genital skin; they are a normal anatomic variant with no malignant potential, typically asymptomatic, and managed with reassurance unless cosmetic or symptomatic concerns prompt elective therapies such as CO2 laser, micro‑punch excision, or focused radiofrequency, with isotretinoin offering inconsistent benefit for prominent lip lesions [^1121SCt5] [^116kN55w] [^113sdkKv] [^112JdZ3p]. I should double-check that I've clearly separated them from angiokeratomas of Fordyce and from Fox‑Fordyce disease to prevent misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment choices [^1155pKqR] [^112f4V11] [^115RFM7M] [^111Z6Y4W].

Fordyce spots are **benign ectopic sebaceous glands** that appear as small, painless, yellow-white papules [^112JdZ3p] on the lips, oral mucosa [^117VgNyY], or genital skin. They are **non-infectious and not sexually transmitted** [^112JdZ3p], requiring no treatment unless for cosmetic reasons. If desired, options include CO2 laser [^113sdkKv], electrosurgery [^116kN55w], or micro-punch excision, with low recurrence and minimal scarring [^1121SCt5]. They are common, asymptomatic, and have **no malignant potential** [^112JdZ3p].

---

## Clinical appearance and distribution

- **Appearance**: Small (1–3 mm), painless, yellow-white or flesh-colored papules [^112JdZ3p] [^1121SCt5].
- **Common sites**: Lips, oral mucosa [^117VgNyY], genital skin (scrotum, shaft of penis, labia majora, inner thigh, lower abdomen).
- **Symptoms**: Typically asymptomatic [^112JdZ3p]; may cause cosmetic concern or mild itching/discomfort during sexual activity [^1121SCt5].

---

## Histological features

Histology shows **ectopic sebaceous glands** without associated hair follicles, characterized by **enlarged sebaceous lobules** and central ducts opening to the surface.

---

## Etiology and pathogenesis

The **etiology** reflects benign ectopic sebaceous glands and is neither infectious nor sexually transmitted, while the **pathogenesis** involves normal sebaceous glands located at atypical sites (oral or genital mucosa) [^112JdZ3p].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The **differential diagnosis** includes pearly penile papules, molluscum contagiosum, genital warts, milia, syringomas, lichen planus, leukoplakia, mucoceles, and herpes simplex virus lesions.

---

## Treatment options

- **No treatment**: Typically unnecessary unless for cosmetic reasons [^112JdZ3p].
- **CO2 laser**: Effective with excellent cosmetic results [^113sdkKv].
- **Electrosurgery**: Intralesional electrocoagulation with insulated microneedle radiofrequency [^116kN55w].
- **Micro-punch excision**: Effective with low recurrence and minimal scarring [^1121SCt5].
- **Topical isotretinoin**: Variable efficacy; may reduce size/number.

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis is excellent; the condition is benign with **no malignant potential** [^112JdZ3p]. Complications are rare and may include **mild scarring or hyperpigmentation** after treatment.

---

## Patient education and counseling

Education should emphasize that these lesions are **benign, common, non-infectious, and not sexually transmitted** [^116kN55w]. Counseling should focus on **reassurance**, with treatment pursued **only if cosmetically desired** [^112JdZ3p].

---

Fordyce spots are **benign ectopic sebaceous glands** that are asymptomatic and non-infectious, with no malignant potential. Treatment is **optional** and effective options are available for cosmetic concerns.

### Micro-punch technique for treatment of Fordyce spots: A surgical approach for an unpleasant condition of the male genital [^1121SCt5]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Fordyce spots are ectopic sebaceous glands, ranging between 2 and 3 mm in diameter. These benign lesions are most frequently located in the oral mucosa and genital skin. Especially in the male genital region, they can cause itching, discomfort during sexual activities, and are aesthetically unpleasant. So far, a variety of therapeutic procedures have been reported with varying success and recurrence rates. In the present retrospective study (n = 23 patients between 2003 and 2011), we present our surgical approach by means of the micro-punch technique. Using this effective method, we achieved very satisfactory functional and cosmetic results. There were no signs of recurrence during postoperative observations from 12 up to 84 months (median = 51.3 months).

### Dichotomous long-term response to isotretinoin in two patients with Fordyce spots [^112JdZ3p]. Pediatric Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Fordyce spots are benign, enlarged sebaceous glands that commonly present as tiny yellow papules on various body surfaces, including the lips. Although these lesions are asymptomatic, in some patients, they are abundant and conspicuous, leading to concerns regarding their cosmetic appearance. The response of Fordyce spots to isotretinoin therapy is poorly documented in the literature, which contains only one case report of an affected patient treated with a short course of isotretinoin (35 mg/kg in total). Herein, we report a dichotomous long-term response to a standard course of isotretinoin in two patients with Fordyce spots of the lips and concomitant acne.

### A case of successful treatment of Fordyce spots with a single insulated microneedle radiofrequency device [^116kN55w]. Dermatologic Therapy (2019). Low credibility.

Fordyce spots are ectopic sebaceous glands which typically present as asymptomatic, multiple whitish or yellowish 1–3 mm sized papules on the lips. Several therapeutic approaches have been proposed, such as laser, electrical or chemical ablation, and micropunch excision. However, these modalities pose the risk of scarring from inevitable surface damage. In this report, we present a case of Fordyce spots which was successfully treated with intralesional electrocoagulation using a proximally insulated microneedle and monopolar radiofrequency device, resulting in marked cosmetic improvements without surface damage.

### Treatment of Fordyce spots with CO2 laser [^113sdkKv]. Dermatologic Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Fordyce spots are heterotopic sebaceous glands that can be located at the lips' vermilion or the oral mucosa. Although this is considered a rather common disorder, a treatment for this condition, which sometimes affects patients from a cosmetic viewpoint, has not yet been described.

- **Objective**: To evaluate CO2 superpulsed laser treatment in two subjects with Fordyce spots.

- **Methods**: Two patients with papules and yellowish plaques at the upper lip, corresponding to Fordyce spots, were treated with the Coherent Ambulase CO2 superpulsed laser (Coherent Medical, Palo Alto, CA). After informed consent was obtained, two to three passes were performed in one session using 2 and 4 W and a spot size of 2 mm.

- **Results**: Complete re-epithelization was observed two weeks later, with no residual Fordyce papules in the treated area and no side effects.

- **Conclusion**: Our findings suggest that CO2 superpulsed laser can be considered a safe and effective treatment for patients with Fordyce spots, offering excellent cosmetic results.

### Ytfk activates the stringent response by triggering the alarmone synthetase Spot in Escherichia coli [^1171ifh4]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The SpoT-YtfK ratio controls the switch of SpoT activities. Interestingly, we did not select the spoT allele in the multicopy suppressor assay. To determine whether SpoT level is involved in the regulation of (p)ppGpp synthetase and hydrolase activities, we monitored the growth of a ΔrelA mutant carrying plasmid pEG25-spoT on SMG plates. As shown in Fig. 1b, induction of spoT failed to suppress the growth defect of a ΔrelA mutant on SMG medium. This result supports the notion that ectopic production of SpoT is not associated with an increased level of (p)ppGpp. Importantly, we observed that induction of spoT above 50 µM of IPTG rendered the WT strain unable to grow on SMG plates (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Moreover, strong induction of spoT triggered an amino acid auxotrophic phenotype in the ΔrelA mutant (Supplementary Fig. 1a). These results strongly support that a high level of SpoT reduces the basal level of (p)ppGpp, consistent with previous observations. Finally, we observed that induction of spoT complements the amino acid auxotrophic phenotype of the ppGpp 0 strain only at concentrations below 250 µM IPTG. Taken together, these data suggest that artificial control of SpoT level determines the switching from (p)ppGpp synthesis to degradation.

Our observation that ectopic production of YtfK triggers SpoT-dependent (p)ppGpp accumulation in the absence of external stresses (Fig. 1c) raises the possibility that the regulation of SpoT activity by YtfK is likely to act by a change in the SpoT/YtfK ratio. To address this possibility, we thoroughly monitored the growth phenotype of the WT strain.

### Enskyce [^114cUvjW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Breakthrough bleeding, spotting, and amenorrhea are frequent reasons for patients discontinuing oral contraceptives. In cases of breakthrough bleeding, as with all instances of irregular vaginal bleeding, nonfunctional causes should be considered. In situations of undiagnosed persistent or abnormal vaginal bleeding, adequate diagnostic measures are necessary to rule out pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology has been excluded, allowing time or switching to another formulation may solve the problem. Changing to an oral contraceptive with a higher estrogen content can minimize menstrual irregularity; however, this should be done only if necessary, as it may increase the risk of thromboembolic disease.

- **Use of oral contraceptives in the event of a missed menstrual period**: If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period, and discontinue oral contraceptive use if pregnancy is confirmed. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out.

### Purpuric eruption in a child [^115SZFvg]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

- **Diagnosis**: The question asks for the diagnosis based on a purpuric eruption in a child. The options included:

	- A. Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP): Incorrect. HSP is a type of small-vessel vasculitis seen mostly in children, commonly after an upper respiratory tract infection. It presents with palpable purpura and is often associated with extracutaneous manifestations such as arthralgias, abdominal pain, and nephritis. Pathology in HSP shows leukocytoclastic vasculitis of small vessels.

	- B. Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF): Incorrect. The patient had no relevant travel history to endemic regions. Additionally, RMSF is commonly preceded by systemic symptoms such as fever, severe headache, and myalgias. Pathology in RMSF shows early perivascular edema, erythrocyte extravasation, thrombosis, and vasculitis in later lesions.

	- C. Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD): Incorrect. HFMD presents with oval-shaped vesicles on the hands and feet and oral lesions which were not present in this patient.

	- D. Papular purpuric gloves and socks syndrome (PPGSS): Correct. The clinical presentation of erythematous and purpuric patches on the hands and feet were consistent with this condition. Serum testing showed Coxsackie B6 as the culprit, a previously reported cause of PPGSS. Pathology showed a superficial perivascular mixed infiltrate of lymphocytes and eosinophils and dermal hemorrhage. Because histopathologic findings in PPGSS are nonspecific and common to viral exanthems, biopsy is not needed as part of the evaluation. In this case, it was performed to exclude vasculitis.

	- E. Exanthematous drug eruption: The text related to this option is truncated in the original document, hence no further details are provided.

### Treatment of angiokeratomas of Fordyce with topical rapamycin 0.25% cream [^11773Zch]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

For our patient, given the undetectable blood rapamycin level and satisfaction with the cost of therapy and minimal side effect profile, we anticipate that he will be able to continue this medication long-term for further improvement of his angiokeratomas of Fordyce. However, future studies are required to evaluate the true efficacy and safety, including the consequences of long-term use. Topical rapamycin may be a promising alternative treatment for patients with angiokeratomas of Fordyce who are unable to tolerate other therapeutic options.

### Fox-Fordyce disease exacerbated by hyperhidrosis [^111Z6Y4W]. Pediatric Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Fox-Fordyce disease is an uncommon disorder that primarily affects postpubertal females. It is characterized by intensely pruritic, papular eruptions in apocrine-gland bearing regions. Due to its rarity and the scant literature available, there is a lack of definitive treatment options or pathognomonic diagnostic indicators. We report a 16-year-old boy with typical findings of Fox-Fordyce disease, including numerous grouped, rounded (1–3 mm), skin-colored papules confined to the axillary and periareolar areas bilaterally. These lesions started before puberty and were exacerbated by hyperhidrosis.

### The genetic architecture of coordinately evolving male wing pigmentation and courtship behavior in Drosophila elegans and Drosophila gunungcola [^116WrVVd]. G3 (2014). Low credibility.

Traits for QTL analysis

As previously described, approximately half of the backcross progeny males lacked wing spots, resulting in skewed distributions of wing spot size measurements from the normal distribution. Normality of trait value distribution is a basic assumption of continuous variables in most QTL mapping methods. Because we could not transform the backcross progeny spot size distributions to normal distributions, we analyzed the wing spot trait in three ways: Spot Presence, Spot Size 1, and Spot Size 2.

- **Spot presence**: The wing spot trait was scored as presence (1) or absence (0), regardless of the size of the spot, and categorical IM was performed.
- **Spot size 1**: The full backcross spot size datasets were used, including individuals with no wing spot pigmentation.
- **Spot size 2**: Only individuals with pigment in the wing spot area were used. Both IM and CIM were performed on the Spot Size 1 and Spot Size 2 backcross datasets.

For the courtship score trait, we used a numerical system with 0 referring to D. gunungcola-like courtship and 4 referring to D. elegans-like courtship. The interspecific difference in courtship behavior can also be dissected into several discrete elements. Therefore, we scored the presence or absence of three courtship elements: Wing Display, Circling, and Body Shaking in backcross males and analyzed them using categorical IM. These courtship elements were previously described in detail.

Epistatic interaction analysis

Pairwise interactions between markers were tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA) to identify any significant epistatic interactions.

### Instinct: Multi-sample integration of spatial chromatin accessibility sequencing data via stochastic domain translation [^113V7B2a]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

In stage 2, we task the discriminator with distinguishing between the real data matrix and the fake data matrix, while also discerning the categories of spots. Here, the categories of spots corresponding to are defined by the target domains.

Four types of loss functions are employed in stage 2 to train the model, including adversarial loss, classification loss, reconstruction loss, and a new loss function called latent loss.

- **Adversarial loss**: Remains the same as in stage 1.
- **Classification loss**: Remains the same as in stage 1.
- **Reconstruction loss and latent loss**: Calculated as follows, where spot representation and the assigned target category correspond to the target domains. The generator is trained to accurately map spots to domains of target slices.

We developed the latent loss to better remove the batch effects between samples:

- **Spot representation**: For each spot, we identify positive samples and negative samples. A positive sample, a negative sample, and the spot form a triplet. We use triplet loss to encourage the spot to be close to its positive samples and far from negative samples in the latent space. The positive samples are the nearest neighbors selected for the spot during the PNG process, while the negative samples are randomly chosen from the same slice as the spot, following the manner of STAligner. Here, the i-th positive sample and the j-th negative sample found for the spot, respectively, are represented, and the hyperparameter of triplet loss is denoted.

However, we cannot guarantee that all positive samples found for a particular spot are the same type as that spot. In fact, if a spot belongs to a type specific to a certain slice, or if the number of spots…

### Targeting cellular senescence with senotherapeutics: Development of new approaches for skin care [^117449mH]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Aging of the skin is evidenced by increased wrinkles, age spots, dryness, and thinning with decreased elasticity. Extrinsic and intrinsic factors including UV, pollution, and inflammation lead to an increase in senescent cells (SnCs) in skin with age that contribute to these observed pathological changes. Cellular senescence is induced by multiple types of damage and stress and is characterized by the irreversible exit from the cell cycle with upregulation of cell cycle-dependent kinase inhibitors p16INK4a and p21CIP1. Most SnCs also developed an inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that drives further pathology through paracrine effects on neighboring cells and endocrine effects on cells at a distance.

Recently, compounds able to kill senescent cells specifically, termed senolytics, or suppress the SASP, termed senomorphics, have been developed that have the potential to improve skin aging as well as systemic aging in general. Here, we provide a summary of the evidence for a key role in cellular senescence in driving skin aging. In addition, the evidence for the potential application of senotherapeutics for skin treatments is presented. Overall, topical, and possibly oral senotherapeutic treatments have tremendous potential to eventually become a standard of care for skin aging and related skin disorders.

### Fordyce granules and hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer syndrome [^117VgNyY]. Gut (2005). Low credibility.

Germline mutations in mismatch repair (MMR) genes are found in only about half of clinically diagnosed families with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer syndrome (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome. Early identification of gene carriers is essential to reduce cancer incidence and overall mortality.

- **Aims**: Recent evidence indicates an increase in size and number of sebaceous glands following activation of the hedgehog pathway, a crucial signalling pathway for animal development that is aberrantly activated in several types of cancer. This study aimed to assess a possible association between Fordyce granules (FGs — that is, ectopic sebaceous glands on the oral mucosa) and HNPCC.

- **Methods**: A total of 15 members of five different genetically unrelated HNPCC kindreds (MLH1 gene mutation n = 8; undetectable MLH1 protein at immunochemistry n = 4; clinical diagnosis n = 3) and 630 genetically unrelated age- and sex-matched healthy controls were examined. Following an examination of the oral mucosa surface, subjects were categorised as either FGs positive or FGs negative.

- **Results**: Evidence of FGs was significantly associated with HNPCC (13/15 (86.7%) affected patients v 6/630 (0.95%) controls; p < 0.0001), with a relative risk of 91.0 (95% confidence interval 40.05–206.76). The observed difference remained significant when carriers of germline mutations in MMR genes were considered (8/15 v 6/630; p < 0.0001). The most common site for the FGs in HNPCC patients was the lower gingival and vestibular oral mucosa.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings suggest that a previously unrecognised activation of…

### The striate artery, hematoma, and spot sign on coronal images of computed tomography angiography in putaminal intracerebral hemorrhage [^1162JBbo]. Stroke (2013). Low credibility.

A spot sign is a bright spot on computed tomography angiography source images, which is predictive of hematoma growth in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage, although the cause of the spot sign is unclear. Our aim was to investigate the spot sign seen on computed tomography angiography and a striate artery, which is a presumed site of intracerebral hemorrhage bleeding origin in the putamen.

- **Methods**: In consecutive cases of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage in the putamen, spot signs and striate arteries were evaluated. Coronal reformat images of computed tomography angiography were created to visualize the striate arteries. Acute deterioration, defined as hematoma enlargement, emergency hematoma removal, or death within the day of admission, was reviewed.

- **Results**: Of the 141 patients undergoing computed tomography angiography, 15 of the 30 patients (50%) who had spot signs showed an intrahematoma striate artery (termed spot and tail sign), which was a linear density extending from the middle cerebral artery toward the spot sign. Acute deterioration occurred more frequently in patients who had a spot and tail sign compared with patients who had spot signs without intrahematoma striate arteries (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that hematoma volume, spot signs, and intrahematoma striate arteries were independent predictors of acute deterioration (P < 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: The presence of a spot and tail sign, assumed to indicate active bleeding from the striate artery, could be a more sensitive predictor of acute deterioration than the presence of a spot sign alone.

### Spatio-temporal analysis of prostate tumors in situ suggests pre-existence of treatment-resistant clones [^112E4w1D]. Nature Communications (2022). Low credibility.

**Specific criteria for determination of responding factors**: The number of spots of a responding factor was required to have a majority of spots located pre-ADT, with at most a few spots located post-ADT. This cutoff was arbitrarily set to be 50% of spots in the factor needed to be annotated by the pathologist as residual cancer. The number of spots of the factor post-ADT should be greater than 15%. A factor was included as a non-responding factor if the factor had activity in a minimum of 10 spots in at least one biopsy post-ADT. For spot-wise factor analysis described in Fig. 4, qualifying spots are required to, post-ADT, be annotated by the pathologist as either one or a mix of the following: 'PCa', 'PCa infiltration in desmoplastic stroma', 'Suspicious for residual PCa' (if other spots from the same factor belong to spots locat…).

### Annovera [^115pSG28]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Bleeding irregularities and amenorrhea

Bleeding and/or spotting that occurs at any time while the vaginal system is inserted is considered "unscheduled" bleeding/spotting. Bleeding/spotting that occurs during the dose-free week when the vaginal system is out is considered "scheduled" bleeding.

- **Unscheduled and scheduled bleeding and spotting**: Females using ANNOVERA may experience unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding and spotting, especially during the first month of use. If unscheduled bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles on ANNOVERA, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different CHC. Based on subject diaries from the two clinical efficacy trials of ANNOVERA [see Clinical Trial Experience (6.1)], 5–10% of females experienced unscheduled bleeding per 28-day cycle. The average number of days with unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting in treatment cycles 1 to 13 for those females who experienced unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting was 1 day or less per cycle. A total of 41 subjects (1.7%) discontinued use due to menstrual disorders, including metrorrhagia, menorrhagia, and abnormal withdrawal bleeding.

- **Amenorrhea and oligomenorrhea**: Females who are not pregnant and use ANNOVERA may experience amenorrhea. Based on subject diary data from two clinical trials for up to 13 cycles, amenorrhea occurred in 3–5% of females per cycle using ANNOVERA and in 0.9% of females in all 13 cycles. If scheduled bleeding does not occur, consider…

### Whitish outer retinal spots in retinal detachment: Longitudinal follow-up, multimodal imaging, and clinical utility [^116Q8Exi]. Ophthalmology Retina (2022). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to characterize the poorly understood phenomenon of whitish outer retinal spots that occasionally appear in retinal detachment (RD).

The design was a retrospective, consecutive case series involving patients with RDs that had ophthalmoscopically visible whitish outer retinal spots.

- **Methods**: All RDs with whitish outer retinal spots identified by one examiner over a 4-year interval were included, and records were retrospectively reviewed.

- **Main outcome measures**: Clinical and surgical observations, photography, and OCT.

- **Results**: Whitish outer retinal spots were visualized in 51 occurrences of RDs: 45 in rhegmatogenous retinal detachments (RRDs), 5 in tractional RDs, and 1 in exudative RD. In RRDs, the spots usually formed an arcuate band located between the causative retinal break and the attached retina. However, 6 RRDs had spots located between a peripheral gutter of subretinal fluid and attached retina. In 11 eyes, the spots were observed to appear over time or to propagate to areas of detached retina more distal to the break. The spots corresponded to hyperreflective foci in the ellipsoid/interdigitation layers on OCT. The spots were isofluorescent on fluorescein angiography. The average duration of symptoms before surgical repair was 27.7 days. In 7 of 23 eyes surgically repaired by the author, the distribution of the spots assisted in localizing an occult retinal break. The spots sometimes appeared or persisted in areas of residual subretinal fluid but invariably resolved after retinal reattachment.

In conclusion, whitish outer retinal spots can occur in all types of RDs.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis in adults with phototherapy and systemic therapies [^116JF1LH]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for atopic dermatitis, specifically concerning systemic antihistamines, the 2024 AAD guidelines indicate that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of oral antihistamines for managing atopic dermatitis.

### Evolution of computed tomography angiography spot SIGN is consistent with a site of active hemorrhage in acute intracerebral hemorrhage [^115WszPm]. Stroke (2014). Low credibility.

CT angiography spot sign predicts hematoma expansion in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The spot sign may represent a site of active extravasation, a locus of arrested hemorrhage forming fibrin globes, or represent associated epiphenomena such as hypertensive microaneurysms. We sought to describe the evolution of spot signs over 60 seconds in acute ICH using dynamic CT angiography and determine whether they grow and diffuse into the hematoma as would be expected with active extravasation.

- **Methods**: We prospectively identified consecutive patients presenting with spontaneous ICH less than 6 hours from symptom onset who completed dynamic CT angiography imaging over a 60-second acquisition protocol. We determined spot positivity, quantified spot volumes, and then used repeated-measures ANOVA to assess changes in spot volume over time.

- **Results**: We collected data on 35 patients; 13 of 35 (37%) patients were spot-positive. Spot-positive patients had larger median ICH volume compared with spot-negative patients (median 10.7 versus 49.2 mL; P = 0.007). Maximal spot sign volumes ranged from 0.02 to 2.8 mL (median 0.17 mL). Spot sign volumes increased significantly with time (P < 0.001) and seemed to disperse into the hematoma in all cases. Three of 13 (23%) spot-positive patients presented with 2 distinct spot signs, but the remaining patients either had only 1 spot sign or different contiguous components of an irregularly shaped spot sign.

- **Conclusions**: In this dynamic CT angiography study of ICH, spot signs evolve consistent with sites of active extravasation.

### An Alzheimer's disease mechanism based on early pathology, anatomy, vascular-induced flow, and migration of maximum flow stress energy location with increasing vascular disease [^112nhLfo]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Low credibility.

Maps of hot spots, cisterns, and early pathology locations for three various diseases reveal critical insights into Alzheimer's pathology.

Figure 1 shows a basal view map of the early disease phase locations for tau, Aβ, and α-synuclein pathology. These can be compared in Figures 2 and 3 with the locations of the major subarachnoid brain cisterns and MRI-designated CSF hot spots, respectively. In Figure 1, major arteries serving the brain are shown in red. The two major arteries are the carotid pair feeding the upper part of the circle of Willis and the basilar artery that flows over the pons. These two systems are weakly interconnected, forming the circle of Willis. The subarachnoid cisterns are formed by CSF flowing between the subarachnoid layer and the bottom layer in the artery-filled space depicted in Figure 2. Parkinson's disease stages in the table of Figure 1 refer to early α-synuclein pathology. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) stages in the table of Figure 1 refer to early tau pathology, except where noted for Aβ pathology. Black and dark gray regions in Figure 3 are designated as CSF hot spots.

### Finacea foam [^1152TA4L]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

The efficacy and safety of Finacea Foam were evaluated in two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, 12-week clinical trials (Trials 1 and 2) in subjects with papulopustular rosacea, with a mean lesion count of 21.3 (range 12 to 50) inflammatory papules and pustules. A total of 1362 subjects (681 active; 681 vehicle), aged 19 to 92 years with a mean age of 50.6 years, 95.7% Caucasian, and 73.4% female, participated in the trials.

- **Exclusions**: Subjects were excluded if they had ocular rosacea, phymatous rosacea, plaque-type rosacea lesions, required systemic treatment, were known non-responders to azelaic acid, or had hypersensitivity to any study drug ingredients.

Finacea Foam or its vehicle was to be applied twice daily for 12 weeks. No other topical or systemic medication affecting rosacea or evaluability was permitted during the studies. Participants were instructed to avoid foods and beverages that may provoke erythema, flushing, and blushing, such as spicy food, hot drinks, and alcohol. They were also advised to avoid products that may cause local irritation, including soaps, alcohol-containing cleansers, tinctures, astringents, abrasives, and peeling agents.

The efficacy endpoints were:

- Nominal change in inflammatory lesion count from baseline.
- Success defined as a score of "clear" or "minimal" with at least a 2-step reduction from baseline on a 5-point scale.

### Hedgehog topological defects in 3D amorphous solids [^115ZWKQM]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

- **Correlation between the soft spots and the topological defects**: The color map visualizes the 3D average topological charge density. The black symbols are the locations of soft spots, identified using the softness parameter in Eq. (7). Pair correlation functions between HTDs, such as monopoles (p) and anti-monopoles (n), and plastic soft spots (s) for different frequencies are shown. Note that for better visualization, the curves for ω > 1.1 are shifted upward by constant factors in this and all other similar datasets (see Supplementary Fig. 4 for extended data).

In Fig. 2b and 2c, the correlation between HTDs and soft spots is depicted. Our results reveal that both positive and negative defects exhibit strong correlations with soft spots at short and intermediate distances at low frequency. However, these correlations quickly vanish as ω increases (see Supplementary Fig. 4). This outcome presents marked differences from the 2D case, where soft spots predominantly correlate with negative defects at short distances. In the 3D context, the sign of the topological charge Q does not play an important role. In fact, this could have been anticipated by examining the definition of the topological charge Q in Eq. (1) and recalling that the sign of the eigenvector field in the normal mode analysis is arbitrary. Since the sign of the eigenvector field e k is arbitrary, the sign of the topological charge Q derived from it is also arbitrary and lacks physical significance. This explains our findings, which do not present any difference between positive and negative defects up to statistical fluctuations.

### Oral manifestation like Forchheimer spots of dengue fever [^112EEpkz]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Low credibility.

A 6-year-old boy of mixed Japanese and Caucasian origin presented with a 4-day history of fever, cough, and blepharedema in 2014. He had a medical history of bronchial asthma and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, treated with methylphenidate. Blood test results indicated a mild decrease in white blood cell count (1,990/µL) and thrombocyte counts (9.6 × 10⁴/µL) without liver and kidney dysfunction. The dengue NS1 antigen tested positive, identifying the dengue virus as type 1. The patient had not traveled abroad in the past 2 weeks; however, there was an outbreak of dengue fever in Japan in 2014. He exhibited spotted submucosal hemorrhages on the hard palate and rose-colored spots on the soft palate. As his fever subsided, a diffuse rash appeared on day 6 of the illness without severe complications, and the rose-colored spots improved by day 7. The boy did not display symptoms specific to rubella, measles, or scarlet fever, which are occasionally associated with Forchheimer spots.

Oral manifestations of dengue infection, excluding submucosal hemorrhages, are uncommon (less than 10%). However, some authors report occurrences in 14–43% of cases, often as diffuse mucosal erythema or mucosal involvement. Furthermore, Siler et al. reported that 19% of dengue fever patients, experimentally infected by mosquito bites, displayed throat congestion. Yet, red spots on the soft palate, such as Forchheimer spots, have not been documented in the literature.

### Epidemiological survey of the quantity and anatomical position of facial pigmented spots in relation to age in 454 Japanese women [^112VaAv6]. The Journal of Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Facial pigmented spots are one of the phenotypes of skin aging, yet no quantitative analysis of spot features such as color intensity, size, anatomical position, and number on the cheek has been performed. In the study, we conducted an epidemiological survey of 454 Japanese women in their 20s to 70s and analyzed age-related changes and site differences of facial pigmented spots. Using image analysis of high-resolution digital facial photographs, 4,912 individual pigmented spots were quantified according to color, size, anatomical position, and total number on the cheek.

As a result of color analysis, the color intensity of individual pigmented spots increased with aging, significantly so between ages 30s and 50s. The age-related increase in the melanin index of facial spots was confirmed in all sites, but it did not significantly differ between facial subregions. Regarding the size of pigmented spots, the frequency of large spots increased with age, and large spots were detected in all facial sites. The total number of pigmented spots on the entire cheek increased with aging, significantly so between the 20s and 40s. The number of pigmented spots tended to increase from the region near the canthi to the lower cheeks. Notably, the number of spots markedly increased in the buccal regions compared to the infraorbital and zygomatic regions.

The data and methodology presented in the study can link the state of facial pigmentation with the various factors involved in the histological development of pigmented spots. This opens new possibilities in the fields of skin pharmacology.

### Differential diagnosis of round or discoid lesions [^111Z96DE]. Clinics in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Dermatologists are tasked with diagnosing various skin conditions across different age groups. The process of dermatologic diagnosis involves the identification of a primary lesion, utilizing morphologic clues to categorize the pathological process causing the eruption. Additionally, the distribution and grouping of lesions aid in supporting a specific diagnosis. Dermatologists, drawing on clinical experience and exposure to similarly appearing skin lesions in lectures, texts, and journals, employ pattern recognition, either consciously or subconsciously, to develop their differential diagnosis. Round and discoid patches and plaques are extremely prevalent in dermatology clinical practice. This contribution reviews the dermatologic conditions that present as round or discoid lesions and outlines an approach to diagnosis.

### Multicenter accuracy and interobserver agreement of spot SIGN identification in acute intracerebral hemorrhage [^116jRanP]. Stroke (2014). Low credibility.

Rapid, accurate, and reliable identification of the computed tomography angiography spot sign is required to identify patients with intracerebral hemorrhage for trials of acute hemostatic therapy. We sought to assess the accuracy and interobserver agreement for spot sign identification.

A total of 131 neurology, emergency medicine, and neuroradiology staff and fellows underwent imaging certification for spot sign identification before enrolling patients in three trials targeting spot-positive intracerebral hemorrhage for hemostatic intervention (STOP-IT, SPOTLIGHT, STOP-AUST). Ten intracerebral hemorrhage cases (spot-positive/negative ratio, 1:1) were presented for evaluation of spot sign presence, number, and mimics. True spot positivity was determined by consensus of two experienced neuroradiologists. Diagnostic performance, agreement, and differences by training level were analyzed.

Mean accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for spot sign identification were 87%, 78%, and 96%, respectively. Overall sensitivity was lower than specificity (P < 0.001) because true spot signs were incorrectly perceived as spot mimics. Interobserver agreement for spot sign presence was moderate (k = 0.60). When true spots were correctly identified, 81% correctly identified the presence of single or multiple spots. The median time needed to evaluate the presence of a spot sign was 1.9 minutes (interquartile range, 1.2–3.1 minutes). Diagnostic performance, interobserver agreement, and time needed for spot sign evaluation were similar among staff physicians and fellows.

### Cellular heterogeneity of pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte grafts is mechanistically linked to treatable arrhythmias [^112VNEGP]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2024). High credibility.

For each spot, we calculated its human score as the total number of reads that were mapped to the human genome and its pig score as that mapped to the pig genome. In tissue with RA-PSC-CM treatment, we assigned a spot as human if its human score was greater than 30 and its pig score was less than 350. These thresholds were defined based on density distributions of values across all spots. Principal-component analysis of all spots based on all human and pig genes clearly distinguished human and pig spots (Extended Data Fig. 8a).

In total, we identified 62 human spots in the RA-PSC-CM sample and 50 human spots in the PSC-CM sample. Spot assignment was consistent with experimental immunofluorescent evidence (Extended Data Fig. 8b). Based on physical spatial distance, we further classified a pig spot as a human-like interfaced spot if this pig spot was among the 20 nearest neighbors of a human spot and its distance to the human spot was less than 1,500 pixels (Extended Data Fig. 7e). These interfaced (human-like) spots could dominantly contain pig cells with a minority of human cells. They clearly represented the neighborhood where cellular interactions could occur through mechanisms such as paracrine ligand–receptor signaling.

- **Differential expression analysis**: After quality control, although there was only one biological sample for each condition, we used the observation that spots were measured separately and independently…

### Mechanical-scan-free multicolor super-resolution imaging with diffractive spot array illumination [^1119siCq]. Nature Communications (2024). Low credibility.

Increasing the number of illumination spots is desirable for improving the effective field of view (FoV); however, achieving this capability in a super-resolution spot array while maintaining good uniformity is challenging. Linear programming has been used to obtain globally optimal phase distributions of SLMs for linearly polarized incident beams with a single super-resolution spot. However, diffractive optical elements have rarely been used to achieve multi-spot resolution beyond the diffraction limit. Two super-resolution spots were designed by modifying the IFTA algorithm. Notably, Ogura et al. modified the IFTA to design super-resolution spot arrays using DOEs. However, a light efficiency of only ~10% was achieved with a 3 × 3 spot array, with the spot size reduced to 0.8 Airy. Furthermore, our group previously proposed a modified algorithm and experimentally achieved ~30% light efficiency with a 3 × 3 spot array with a spot size of 0.5 Airy, which is undesirable in nanoscale imaging applications.

To obtain a super-resolution spot, the sampling interval in the focal plane must be reduced by applying a zero-padding operation to the input plane. The size of the input plane zero-padding was at least 1/8 the size of the original spot to ensure that the spot details could be precisely described. The size of the phase hologram is approximately by according to the resampling technique, i.e. the size of the 50 × 50 (N = 50) spot array is two orders of magnitude larger than the 3 × 3 (N = 3) spot array if the sampling precision is the same.

### Reconstruction of the tumor spatial microenvironment along the malignant-boundary-nonmalignant axis [^112dCt1m]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The CNV scores of each spot were added to the clustered Seurat object. In combination with the HE staining, CNV labels with high median CNV scores (usually 2–4) were included in "MalLabels", and spots within these labels were initially defined as core spots of malignant spots.

Based on the clustering result, if more than half of the spots in the cluster are identified as MalLabel, this cluster will be defined as a malignant cluster. Cottrazm calculated the coordinates of the centroid of malignant cluster k (Ci Mal, k) and normal cluster (Ci normal) based on UMAP embeddings. Then, Cottrazm calculated the Euclidian distance from spot i in malignant cluster k to Ci Mal, k, denoted as radius to Ci Mal (rt i, k), and to Ci normal, denoted as radius to Ci normal (rn i, k). The label of spot i (nbr i) was defined according to the following rule:

- **Find neighbor spots of tumor core**: Cottrazm arranged spatial spots on hexagonal lattices and applied a natural way to define the neighboring spots. Briefly, it utilized the spatial information along each axis, using the image pixel coordinates and corresponding array coordinates of each spot to fit a linear model. Cottrazm then added the distances along each axis and multiplied this by a scaled factor to obtain the Manhattan distance, denoted as radius (r), which represents the maximum distance between neighboring spots. Next, for any two spots in spatial (spot i and spot j), the Manhattan distance between them (pdist i, j) was calculated using the image pixel coordinate. When pdist i, j ≤ r, these two spots are considered neighbors; otherwise, they are not neighbors.

### Pigmented nail lesions: When to observe, when to biopsy, when to widely excise, and when to amputate [^112mLvk5]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Pigmented nail lesions present challenging problems. The differential diagnosis is broad, ranging from common self-limiting conditions, such as subungual hematoma and infection, to potentially fatal conditions, such as subungual melanoma. Clinical assessment, along with adjuncts like dermoscopy and imaging, is usually insufficient to establish a diagnosis. Consequently, a nail bed biopsy is often required. However, this procedure is not innocuous and may result in permanent nail deformity. Subjecting every patient with nail pigmentation to a biopsy can result in an unacceptably high rate of negative test results. Furthermore, the histopathologic diagnosis of subungual melanoma remains challenging for several reasons. Once the diagnosis of subungual melanoma is established, the definitive treatment is controversial because the existing guidelines have largely been adapted from those for cutaneous melanoma. This review presents an approach to the diagnosis and management of pigmented subungual lesions, particularly subungual melanoma, based on the latest available evidence.

### Treatment of angiokeratomas of Fordyce with topical rapamycin 0.25% cream [^1155pKqR]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Angiokeratomas are benign vascular neoplasms clinically described as well-defined hyperkeratotic, red-to-black papules or plaques. Histologically, they appear as dilated blood vessels in the papillary dermis that form lacunae with associated acanthosis and rete ridge elongation. Multiple variants of angiokeratomas exist, including angiokeratoma of Fordyce (located on the genitalia, including the scrotum), angiokeratoma corporis diffusum (associated with Fabry disease), angiokeratoma of Mibelli (located on acral sites), solitary or multiple angiokeratomas (often located on lower extremities), and angiokeratoma circumscriptum (congenital and occurs on the trunk and extremities).

While angiokeratomas are typically asymptomatic, they can bleed, cause pruritus or pain, and impact psychological health, ultimately driving a patient to seek care. A wide variety of therapeutic options have previously been described, including surgical excision, electrodessication, cautery, cryotherapy, and laser. Here, we describe a patient who demonstrated a positive response to topical rapamycin (sirolimus), an unconventional method of treatment.

### Fox-Fordyce disease: Pulsed dye laser versus fractional Colaser treatment [^1177FbAf]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

A 28-year-old woman presented to the clinic with multiple, itchy skin lesions over both axillae that had persisted for 4 years and increased in number, becoming aggravated during the summer. Previously, these lesions were treated with 1% topical clindamycin phosphate solution twice daily for 2 months, with no improvement. Physical examination showed numerous well-defined round, follicular, skin-colored papules, 2 to 3 mm in diameter, over bilateral axillae. The hair in both axillae was sparse, with normal adjacent skin. A 4-mm punch biopsy from the left armpit revealed mild-infundibular follicular dilatation associated with keratin plugging. Furthermore, there was a mild-perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with occasional eosinophils.

The treatment plan included 3 sessions of pulsed dye laser (PDL) for the right axilla and a fractional CO2 laser for the left axilla at 6-week intervals. However, the interval between the second and third sessions was delayed from 6 weeks to 5 months due to patient travel. The devices used were PDL Candela Vbeam Perfecta and the Lutronic fractional CO2 laser. The PDL settings were fluence of 8 J/cm², spot size of 7 mm, 85 pulses, pulse duration of 3 ms, and level-2 dynamic cooling device. For the fractional CO2 laser, TIP 120 was employed, set at scan-type static, 60 mJ, 30 W power, and 100 spots/cm² density. The endpoint for the fractional CO2 laser was white spots, and the PDL showed mild erythema due to nonpurpuric settings.

### Juleber [^117WcdKk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Breakthrough bleeding, spotting, and amenorrhea are frequent reasons for patients discontinuing oral contraceptives. In breakthrough bleeding, as in all cases of irregular bleeding from the vagina, nonfunctional causes should be considered. In cases of undiagnosed persistent or abnormal bleeding from the vagina, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated to rule out pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another formulation may solve the problem. Changing to an oral contraceptive with a higher estrogen content, while potentially useful in minimizing menstrual irregularity, should be done only if necessary, since this may increase the risk of thromboembolic disease.

- **Use of oral contraceptives in the event of a missed menstrual period**:
	1. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period, and oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed.
	2. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out.

### Evaluation of actual vs expected photodynamic therapy spot size [^113iQCYp]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2009). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of the photodynamic therapy (PDT) laser spot size on the retina generated by two Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved lasers.

- **Design**: Prospective observational case series.

- **Methods**: Fundus photographs were taken of one eye of each of 10 subjects with the WinStation 4000 fundus photography system (OIS; Ophthalmic Imaging Systems, Sacramento, California, USA); disc size was calculated using OIS software. Slit-lamp photographs were taken of the PDT laser spot focused on the retina adjacent to the optic disc, using various spot sizes in combination with three different contact lenses and two different lasers. Spot size on the retina was determined by measuring the ratio of disc diameter to spot diameter in Adobe Photoshop (San Jose, California, USA) and applying this ratio to the OIS disc measurements.

- **Results**: Spot size at the retina averaged 87% of the expected spot size for the Coherent Opal laser (Coherent Inc, Santa Clara, California, USA) and 104% of the expected spot size for the Zeiss Visulas laser (Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc, Dublin, California, USA) (P = 0.002). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the percentage of expected spot size decreased with a larger spot diameter (P = 0.01 for Coherent laser; p = 0.02 for Zeiss laser).

- **Conclusions**: PDT spot size at the retina appears to be consistently smaller than expected for the Coherent laser, while the spot size was consistently within 10% of the expected size for the Zeiss laser. The deviation from expected size increased with a larger spot size when using the Coherent laser.

### On the definition of dermatological disease. Part 1: conceptual frameworks [^117NQuDb]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Terms such as 'neurotic excoriations' might best be avoided as they invite judgments on the affected people. Even morphological terms such as nodules or erythema have become imprecise due to sloppy and inappropriate usage. The word 'carcinoma', used for low-risk basal cell carcinoma, might also be challenged as this term usually implies to a patient a very serious disease that can kill, whereas such occurrences are exceedingly rare.

Some names, such as 'atopic dermatitis' (AD), create an air of spurious precision. 'Atopic' means specific IgE antibodies to common environmental allergens, but many people with the classic AD phenotype are not atopic, especially in the community and in developing countries. The World Allergy Organization Nomenclature Committee has proposed a more logical classification of eczema, as depicted in a guideline figure. It could even be argued that dividing the eczema phenotype into atopic and non-atopic types has done little to increase predictive ability in terms of prognosis or treatment compared with the predictive information that filaggrin gene mutations provide. This serves as a warning against prematurely splitting diseases into subtypes based on possible epiphenomena.

### Treatment of angiokeratoma of Fordyce with pulsed dye laser [^112f4V11]. Dermatologic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Angiokeratomas of Fordyce are typically asymptomatic vascular lesions characterized by blue-to-red papules with a scaly surface, most often located on the scrotum. Although considered benign, the lesions may bleed, either spontaneously or secondary to rupture, leading to patient anxiety and social embarrassment.

- **Objective**: The objective was to determine the safety and effectiveness of the 585-nm pulsed dye laser for the treatment of angiokeratomas of Fordyce.

- **Methods**: Twelve patients with Fitzpatrick skin type II to IV were treated for angiokeratomas of Fordyce with pulsed dye laser (5.5–8.0 J/cm²) in two to six sessions. Lesion clearance was evaluated by two specialists based on digital photographs taken before the first treatment and two months after the last treatment.

- **Results**: Seven patients had an excellent response (clearance rating 75%-100%), and five patients had a good response (clearance rating 50%-75%). Transient purpura and pain were present in all patients. Bleeding during treatment occurred in five patients. There were no permanent side effects.

- **Conclusion**: Pulsed dye laser is effective and safe for the treatment of angiokeratoma of Fordyce, with minimum side effects, providing an additional nonablative therapeutic option.

### Treatment of angiokeratoma of Fordyce with long-pulse neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet laser [^115RFM7M]. Dermatologic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Angiokeratomas are typically asymptomatic, blue-to-red papules with a scaly surface located on the scrotum, shaft of the penis, labia majora, inner thigh, or lower abdomen. The treatment of angiokeratomas may be necessary if they bleed and lead to patient anxiety.

- **Objective**: To determine the safety and effectiveness of long-pulse 1,064 neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser for the treatment of angiokeratomas of Fordyce.

- **Materials and methods**: Ten consecutive patients with angiokeratoma of Fordyce were treated with long-pulse Nd:YAG laser in two to six sessions. The three authors independently assessed the improvement of the lesion based on digital photographs taken before the treatment and 2 months after the end of the treatment.

- **Results**: Significant (> 75%, 50%, < 75%) improvement was seen in six and two patients, respectively. Complete improvement was achieved in one patient. Transient swelling, purpura, bleeding, and some pain in the treated area were noted in all patients as short-term side effects. There were no permanent side effects.

- **Conclusion**: The long-pulse Nd:YAG laser is a highly effective and safe treatment for angiokeratoma of Fordyce.

### Dynamical control enables the formation of demixed biomolecular condensates [^11424VWu]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

In vivo colocalization analysis of CLN3 and BNI1 was conducted using the BIGFish spot detection algorithm, which identifies puncta as local maxima in the smFISH channels given a specified object radius. Puncta (spot) detection can be achieved through two methods:

- **Single function call**: Enumerates the spots directly.
- **Series of intermediate detection steps**: Provides the same results as the single function call but offers more debugging information. This method was selected for its enhanced troubleshooting capabilities in developing the spot detection pipeline. Using this approach, a spot radius (r) of 150 nm (1.389 pixels) was established for detection.

Maximum intensity projections were utilized, and images with uneven illumination or regions of non-overlapping hyphae were excluded from the analysis. For each image where the number of CLN3 and BNI1 spots were within an order of magnitude, the centers of identified RNA spots were calculated. A CLN3 spot was deemed colocalized with a BNI1 spot if any BNI1 center was less than 2r from the CLN3 center. The fraction colocalized refers to the number of CLN3 spots having at least one BNI1 spot less than 2r away, divided by the total number of CLN3 spots.

For the pixel shift analysis, the centers of CLN3 spots were simultaneously shifted by 2r in both the x and y directions before overlap determination. Subsequently, using the shifted CLN3 spot centers, it was assessed whether any BNI1 spot was less than 2r away.

### What is a capillary malformation [^115MzVEs]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Today, the designation "capillary malformation" is widely used as a modern name for what was formerly called a nevus flammeus or port-wine stain. This new terminology, however, is inaccurate and ambiguous. There are at least nine different skin disorders fulfilling the criteria of a capillary malformation. Examples include nevus anemicus, cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita, angiokeratoma circumscriptum, and several vascular lesions that, in the author's view, do not represent nevi, such as the nuchal or glabellar salmon patch and the cutaneous changes of Rendu-Osler disease. Hence, I propose that we should use "capillary malformation" as an umbrella term and not as a name for a specific cutaneous entity.

Dermoscopy of TAF may reveal dilated follicular canals filled with massive hyperkeratotic plugs/follicular spicules and few hair shafts. Although inflammation is not thought to be involved in the etiology of TAF, it may be present in some cases, appearing as reddish-brownish discoloration of the surrounding skin on dermoscopic examination.

- **Aggregated white-yellow globules surrounded by crown vessels**: Incorrect. Aggregated white-yellow globules, also known as the "cumulus sign", surrounded by bending blood vessels with central extension are findings seen in the diagnosis of sebaceous hyperplasia. Additional dermoscopic features…

### Laser test spot practices among dermatologists [^112vCbox]. Dermatologic Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Laser test spots are a preliminary assessment performed on a small area of the skin to evaluate patients' reactions to laser therapy. Despite their recognized importance, there is a gap in knowledge among dermatologists regarding laser test spot practices.

- **Objective**: The authors aim to explore dermatologists' test spot practices.

- **Methods**: A survey was conducted among members of the Association of Academic Cosmetic Dermatology.

- **Results**: Laser test spot practices varied widely between dermatologists, with 3.0% "always", 22.7% "frequently", 54.5% "occasionally", 16.7% "rarely", and 3.0% "never" performing test spots. Most dermatologists (59.4%) wait more than 2 weeks before evaluating a test spot. Furthermore, 68.3% of the respondents use the same laser settings for the test spot as they would for the actual treatment. Regarding location, 60.9% of dermatologists perform laser test spots in the same area intended for treatment, while 39.1% choose another inconspicuous area.

- **Conclusion**: Establishing definitive protocols for laser test spots may reduce variability in practice and enhance the overall safety and efficacy of laser treatments.

### Visudyne [^116yN4Ug]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Visudyne (verteporfin for injection) therapy is a two-step process requiring administration of both the drug and light. The first step is the administration of Visudyne. The second step is the activation of Visudyne with light from a nonthermal diode laser. Physicians should re-evaluate patients three months after treatment. If choroidal neovascular leakage is detected on fluorescein angiography, therapy may be repeated.

- **Lesion size determination**: The greatest linear dimension (GLD) of the lesion should be estimated by fluorescein angiography and color fundus photography. This measurement should include all classic and occult CNV, blood and/or blocked fluorescence, and any serous detachments of the retinal pigment epithelium. Fundus cameras with magnification within the range of 2.4–2.6X are recommended. The GLD of the lesion on the fluorescein angiogram must be corrected for the fundus camera's magnification to obtain the GLD of the lesion on the retina.

- **Spot size determination**: The treatment spot size should be 1,000 microns larger than the GLD of the lesion on the retina, allowing a 500-micron border to ensure full coverage of the lesion. The maximum spot size used in clinical trials was 6,400 microns. The nasal edge of the treatment spot must be positioned at least 200 microns from the temporal edge of the optic disc, even if this results in a lack of photoactivation of CNV within 200 microns of the optic nerve.

The recommended dosage of Visudyne is 6 mg/m².

### Apri28 day [^114XuCmd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Additional instructions for all dosing regimens**: Breakthrough bleeding, spotting, and amenorrhea are frequent reasons for patients discontinuing oral contraceptives. In cases of breakthrough bleeding or any irregular vaginal bleeding, nonfunctional causes should be considered. Adequate diagnostic measures are necessary to rule out pregnancy or malignancy for undiagnosed persistent or abnormal vaginal bleeding. If pathology is excluded, time or changing to another formulation might resolve the issue. Switching to an oral contraceptive with higher estrogen content may minimize menstrual irregularity but should only be done if necessary due to the increased risk of thromboembolic disease.

- **Use of oral contraceptives in the event of a missed menstrual period**: If a patient has not followed the prescribed schedule and misses a period, pregnancy should be considered, and oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed. If the patient followed the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out.

### Daysee [^115FH61J]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Women using Daysee may experience unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting, especially during the first 3 months of use. Bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or by changing to a different contraceptive product. If unscheduled bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, evaluate for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy.

When prescribing Daysee, the occurrence of fewer planned menses (4 per year instead of 13 per year) should be weighed against the occurrence of increased unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting. The primary clinical trial (PSE-301) that evaluated the efficacy of Daysee also assessed unscheduled bleeding. The participants in the 12-month clinical trial (N = 1,006) completed the equivalent of 8,681 28-day cycles of exposure and were composed primarily of women who had used oral contraceptives previously (89%) as opposed to new users (11%). A total of 82 (8.2%) of the women discontinued Daysee, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting.

Scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding and/or spotting remained fairly constant over time, with an average of 3 days of bleeding and/or spotting per each 91-day cycle. Unscheduled bleeding and unscheduled spotting decreased over successive 91-day cycles.

- **Table content**:
	- The number of days with unscheduled bleeding in treatment cycles 1 and 4 was documented. Likewise, the number of days with unscheduled spotting in treatment cycles 1 and 4 was recorded.

This information illustrates the trend of reduced unscheduled bleeding and spotting over time, offering important insights into the overall bleeding profile of Daysee users during treatment.

### Alyacen 1/35 [^112w9Wd8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). Low credibility.

Breakthrough bleeding, spotting, and amenorrhea are frequent reasons for patients discontinuing oral contraceptives. In cases of breakthrough bleeding, and all instances of irregular vaginal bleeding, nonfunctional causes should be considered. For undiagnosed persistent or abnormal bleeding from the vagina, adequate diagnostic measures are necessary to rule out pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another formulation may resolve the problem. Switching to an oral contraceptive with a higher estrogen content can be useful in minimizing menstrual irregularity. However, it should be done only if necessary, as it may increase the risk of thromboembolic disease.

- **Use of oral contraceptives in the event of a missed menstrual period**: If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period, and oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out.

### Consensus statement on diagnostic criteria for PHACE syndrome [^114kKnKw]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

A subgroup of patients with infantile hemangiomas have associated structural anomalies of the brain, cerebral vasculature, eyes, sternum, and/or aorta in the neurocutaneous disorder known as PHACE syndrome. The diagnosis has been broadly inclusive by using a case definition of a facial hemangioma plus ≥ 1 extracutaneous features, leading to numerous reports of potential associated disease features, many of uncertain significance. This consensus statement was thus developed to establish diagnostic criteria for PHACE syndrome.

- **Methods**: A multidisciplinary group of specialists with expertise in PHACE syndrome drafted initial diagnostic criteria based on review of published, peer-reviewed medical literature and clinical experience. The group convened both in executive and general sessions during the PHACE Syndrome Research Conference held in November 2008 for discussion and used a consensus method. All conflicting recommendations were subsequently reconciled via electronic communication and teleconferencing.

- **Results**: These criteria were stratified into two categories: (1) PHACE syndrome or (2) possible PHACE syndrome. Major and minor criteria were determined for the following organ systems: cerebrovascular, structural brain, cardiovascular, ocular, and ventral/midline. Definite PHACE requires the presence of a characteristic segmental hemangioma or hemangioma > 5 cm on the face or scalp plus one major criterion or two minor criteria. Possible PHACE requires the presence of a hemangioma > 5 cm on the face or scalp plus one minor criterion.

### Angiokeratoma of Fordyce response to long pulsed Nd:YAG laser treatment [^113g1Qrn]. Dermatologic Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Angiokeratoma of Fordyce can be easily diagnosed by their typical erythra and cured by various therapeutic methods including surgery, electrocoagulation, cryotherapy, or various laser systems. Which are the optimal therapeutic methods? There are no consensus opinions in the reported articles. We present our characteristic treatment with the application of long pulsed neodymium-doped yttrium-aluminum-garnet (lpNd:YAG) laser in the treatment of angiokeratoma of Fordyce. A 1064 nm lpNd:YAG laser (spot size: 5 mm/7 mm, energy: 90–130 J/cm², and pulse duration: 10–20 ms) was used to treat the patient's lesions. The desirable clinical endpoint of the treatment was lesions shrunk and turned pallor immediately after the irradiation. The treatment interval was at least 8 weeks.

Of the 11 patients, 9 were cured and 2 showed improvement. The mean number of treatment sessions was 2.2. None of the patients experienced scar formation or any other side effects. All of them were satisfied with the treatment results. We conclude that angiokeratoma of Fordyce responded well to lpNd:YAG laser treatment, which provided a simple, rapid, and no bleeding approach for treating angiokeratoma of Fordyce.

### Spot SIGN in intracerebral hemorrhage: Critical reappraisal and future clinical implications [^113kC2Lc]. Stroke (2025). Low credibility.

Different populations, computed tomography (CT) imaging protocols, criteria to define spot signs, and timing of acquisition among studies resulted in heterogeneous findings regarding the prevalence and predictive performance of the spot sign. A meta-analysis of 5087 patients revealed a prevalence of 23%, pooled positive predictive value of 0.60, and sensitivity of 0.57 for predicting HE. These results were in line with two other meta-analyses. However, mounting evidence supports an increase in predictive performance when earlier time from onset, higher density, and spatial evolution features (change in size) of the spot signs are evaluated, especially when incorporated into a score. A multicenter analysis demonstrated a moderate interrater agreement (κ = 0.60) and a median time needed to assess the spot sign of 2 minutes. Yet, a more recent study showed an excellent interrater agreement (κ = 0.93).

It is important to note that the standard definition of HE (≥ 33% or ≥ 6 mL) represents an arbitrary oversimplification of a severity spectrum, and the predictive performance of the spot sign with other definitions and more granular categorizations has been underinvestigated. Notably, in one study, the spot sign was the individual radiological marker with the highest positive predictive value (0.51) for severe HE (≥ 66% or ≥ 12.5 mL).

### Bier spots in two children [^116Q5fsG]. Pediatric dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Bier spots manifest as a distinct pattern of vascular mottling commonly reported in young adults, with the youngest documented case at 15 years old. We describe two cases involving children aged 11 and 12 years.

- **Patient 1**: An 11-year-old boy presented with white spots on the dorsal aspect of his hands.
- **Patient 2**: A 12-year-old girl exhibited similar spots on the dorsal aspect of her left forearm and left hand.

In both patients, the spots were noticeable when the extremities were in a dependent position and disappeared upon elevation of the limbs. Both children were otherwise healthy.

### Dasetta 1/35 [^112mokmE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Headache**: The onset or exacerbation of migraine, or the development of headache with a new pattern that is recurrent, persistent, or severe, requires discontinuation of oral contraceptives and evaluation of the cause.

- **Bleeding irregularities**: Breakthrough bleeding and spotting are sometimes encountered in patients on oral contraceptives, especially during the first three months of use. Nonhormonal causes should be considered, and adequate diagnostic measures taken to rule out malignancy or pregnancy in the event of breakthrough bleeding, as in the case of any abnormal vaginal bleeding. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another formulation may solve the problem. In the event of amenorrhea, pregnancy should be ruled out. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was preexistent.

- **Ectopic pregnancy**: Ectopic as well as intrauterine pregnancy may occur in contraceptive failures.

### Treatment of angiokeratomas of Fordyce with topical rapamycin 0.25% cream [^114VSr2F]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 61-year-old man presented with numerous lesions on the scrotum, which were increasing in number, enlarging, and tender. A shave biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of angiokeratoma. Treatment with a 595-nm pulsed dye laser (PDL) was initiated, with subsequent treatments performed at 4 and 6 months. Although a mild decrease in the size of lesions was noted after each PDL session, the lesions persisted, and the patient was unable to tolerate the PDL sessions due to pain. The lesions remained large and symptomatic, prompting the patient to express a preference for topical treatment.

Thus, he was started on off-label topical rapamycin, with 1 mg tablets compounded into a 0.25% cream, applied twice daily to the affected areas. The medication, obtained from a local compounding pharmacy and covered by Medicaid insurance, was generally well-tolerated apart from an initial transient mild burning irritation lasting approximately 10 minutes post-application. This sensation no longer occurred with continued use.

- **Figures**:
	- **Fig 1A**: Lesions after PDL and before topical rapamycin initiation.
	- **Fig 1B**: Mild reduction in size and number of scrotal angiokeratomas after 3 months of twice-daily topical application of rapamycin 0.25% cream.
	- **Fig 1C**: Sustained improvement in the size and number of scrotal angiokeratomas after 7 months of twice-daily topical application of rapamycin 0.25% cream.

At the 3-month follow-up, the patient reported a resolution of pain and tenderness as well as a subjective "50% improvement" in the condition.

### Spot SIGN in intracerebral hemorrhage: Critical reappraisal and future clinical implications [^113WJmp9]. Stroke (2025). Low credibility.

The CTA spot sign has been historically considered a binary variable, present or absent. However, a more nuanced assessment, considering certain recently described high-risk features, may help refine its predictive performance. Broadly, we can categorize these features as static or dynamic, depending on whether they can be evaluated on a single-phase or multiphase/dynamic CTA imaging protocol. These static and dynamic features of the spot sign might allow for a more granular stratification of hematoma expansion (HE) occurrence and severity risk.

- **Recommended definitions and imaging protocols of spot sign**: A summary of these protocols is provided in Table 3, which is further discussed in detail in the text below.

- **Hematoma expansion risk stratification**: Figure 1 illustrates the risk stratification based on static and dynamic features of the spot sign. It includes an illustration of spot sign features that progressively increase the risk for hematoma expansion occurrence and severity. The gray circle represents the spot sign, while the blue arrows represent its dynamic changes, indicating volume increase or pseudodecrease in case the contrast expansion dilutes with the surrounding hematoma (light gray area). The black circle represents a noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) hypodensity sign. Some of these features have been previously addressed with specific names, such as computed tomography (CT) density (i.e. iodine sign), volume modifications over time (i.e. extravasation rate, leakage rate), and connection with the striate artery (i.e. spot and tail sign).

Table 3 is mentioned in the text as providing a summary of recommended definitions and imaging protocols for spot sign features, which are further discussed in the main text.

### Fox-Fordyce disease treated with fractional CO2 laser: A case report [^114FxAKv]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

Oral treatments, such as isotretinoin and contraceptives, as well as procedural treatments like surgical excision and liposuction, have been attempted in isolated cases. Two cases of Fox-Fordyce disease (FFD) successfully treated with botulinum toxin have also been recently published, presenting another promising therapeutic possibility.

Fractional lasers have not been extensively used for treating FFD lesions. There has been one published case of FFD treated with a fractional CO2 laser, where the lesions and pruritus improved dramatically over the course of three sessions. The degree of success seen in our patient, as well as in this previous case, suggests that fractional CO2 laser may be an effective option in the management of FFD. Future studies investigating efficacy and durability with larger sample sizes and longitudinal follow-up should be conducted to further evaluate this promising treatment modality for this condition.

### AMPA receptors in the synapse turnover by monomer diffusion [^117YEHWt]. Nature Communications (2019). Low credibility.

Colocalization of two fluorescent molecules is defined as the event where two fluorescent spots, representing these molecules, become localized within 240 nm of each other. In single-color experiments using ATTO594, a cross-correlation analysis was employed. When two fluorescent spots, each representing a single molecule of ATTO594, are located close together, the probability that this method can discriminate between the two spots increases with an increase in the distance between the two ATTO594 molecules. The threshold distance for detecting one or two spots was found to occur at 240 nm in the present experimental setup, determined by the signal-to-noise ratio of the instrument and the optical diffraction limit. Using this definition, colocalized trajectories were obtained, and colocalization durations were estimated.

In two-color simultaneous single fluorescent-molecule tracking experiments using the dye pair of ATTO594 and rhodamine110, the distance between the two molecules was directly measured from the locations (x, y-positions) of each differently colored molecule. Even when examining pairs of different-colored molecules that are known to be truly associated, the probability of scoring the two molecules as associated is limited by the localization accuracies of each molecule and the accuracies of superimposing the two images. Based on the accuracies determined here, we found that for truly associated molecules, the probability of scoring the two molecules as associated increases to 99% when using the criterion that the molecules are within the defined distance threshold.

### Café au lait spots: When and how to pursue their genetic origins [^114TW14N]. Clinics in Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Café au lait spots are common birthmarks that appear sporadically and are associated with several genetic syndromes. Dermatologists are frequently consulted by other physicians and parents to evaluate these birthmarks. In certain cases, determining when and how to pursue further evaluation can be challenging. Diagnostic challenges may include the appearance of individual lesions, areas and patterns of cutaneous involvement, and associated features (or the lack thereof). This review aims to clarify when and how to evaluate a child with multiple or patterned café au lait spots. Additionally, it seeks to explain emerging concepts in understanding the genetics of these lesions.

### Asymptomatic violaceous plaques on the dorsal hand [^114EC34C]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

- **Question 2**: Which of the following is true regarding prognosis?
	A. Benign condition with spontaneous regression
	B. Benign condition with persistent lesions
	C. Premalignant condition with potential for progression to angiosarcoma
	D. Malignant condition with local destruction
	E. Invasive malignant condition

- **Answers**:
	A. Benign condition with spontaneous regression – Incorrect. MCAH is considered benign, and although lesions have been reported to spontaneously regress at times, this is uncommon.
	B. Benign condition with persistent lesions – Correct. MCAH lesions rarely regress spontaneously. The condition is benign, and treatment is available by patient preference for cosmetic purpose.
	C. Premalignant condition with potential for progression to angiosarcoma – Incorrect. This is a benign condition with no risk for progression to any kind of cutaneous malignancy.
	D. Malignant condition with local destruction – Incorrect. MCAH is a benign condition. No morbidity or mortality is associated with MCAH.
	E. Invasive malignant condition – Incorrect. This is a benign, noninvasive condition.

### Trichodystrophies: A hair-raising differential diagnosis [^115wz23p]. Clinics in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

The appearance of an individual's hair is often reflective of internal health. Patients with hair shaft disorders commonly present with fragile, lusterless, sparse hair, in addition to psychosocial distress. Hair shaft disorders may be hereditary or acquired and can present in children or adults. Due to their varied presentations, the differential diagnosis for hair disorders is broad and often confusing. The authors present a question-by-question guide to assist clinicians in arriving at the correct diagnosis.
