## Question

PCL test for stability

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to test posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) stability and identify combined injuries. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the history and mechanism to trigger suspicion. Then, I should standardize the examination setup and execute the posterior drawer in neutral. Next, I will add rotational variants of the posterior drawer to screen PMC and PLC contributions, quantify laxity with stress radiography, and corroborate with secondary clinical signs. After that, I should confirm on MRI while avoiding common pitfalls. Finally, I will integrate grading thresholds and implications for treatment, including when combined reconstruction is needed, and I'll keep verifying for potential misinterpretations at each step [^112fG382] [^115oKbuH] [^11144WY7] [^1145KDZ6] [^112TGBTQ] [^115PuCRb].

> Let me first confirm the historical red flags and clinical phenotype that raise suspicion for PCL injury: high-energy mechanisms such as dashboard injury, hyperflexion or hyperextension, or a direct posterior force to the proximal tibia are classic, with patients often male and in their 20s–30s; unlike ACL tears, isolated PCL injuries more often present with pain (patellofemoral, anteromedial, or posterior) and less overt instability, especially with inclines, and high-energy mechanisms should prompt vigilance for concomitant PMC/PLC injuries [^112fG382] [^111zdDCU].

> I need to ensure a standardized exam setup because side-to-side comparisons and constitutional laxity can confound interpretation; I should examine bilaterally, document Beighton score for generalized hyperlaxity, and position the patient supine with knee at 90° flexion and hip at approximately 45° flexion as a baseline for the posterior drawer, aligning my grading with established schemes such as AMA, Hughston, and Harner to keep the assessment reproducible [^115oKbuH] [^112fG382].

> I will now examine the posterior drawer test in neutral rotation as the primary signpost of PCL insufficiency, stabilizing the femur and applying a posterior force to the proximal tibia to gauge translation relative to the contralateral side; I should confirm grading by side-to-side differences rather than absolute values, remembering that clinical test accuracy varies with examiner experience and chronicity due to scar-mediated pseudo-stability, so I must avoid overconfidence in a single maneuver [^115oKbuH] [^114QSXJg].

> Next, I should review the posterior drawer under tibial rotation to interrogate peripheral stabilizers; in internal rotation, the PMC tightens, and in external rotation the PLC tightens, which should modulate posterior translation if those structures are intact; interpretation initially noted that a decrease in posterior translation in internal rotation suggests a PMC injury — wait, let me verify that logic because decreased translation under a tightening maneuver actually implies an intact, compensating PMC, not an injured one, so I should correct this: reduction of PTT in IR points to an intact PMC, whereas relative increase or failure to reduce PTT in IR raises concern for PMC injury, and conversely, reduction of PTT in ER suggests an intact PLC, with persistence or increase in ER raising suspicion for PLC compromise [^115oKbuH] [^11144WY7].

> Hold on, I should quantify laxity objectively to reduce examiner bias; posterior stress radiography at 90° flexion with a standardized posterior force provides reproducible PTT, and a side-to-side difference greater than 8 mm strongly supports a complete PCL tear and in symptomatic patients is a reasonable operative threshold, though I should acknowledge variability across devices and protocols and document my technique for follow-up comparability [^1145KDZ6] [^115PuCRb].

> I need to check for secondary clinical signs that triangulate the diagnosis: a positive posterior sag (Godfrey) and a positive quadriceps active test are supportive, while I must remember that a positive reverse pivot shift generally requires combined PCL plus PLC deficiency; isolated PCL or isolated PLC injuries alone do not reproducibly produce a positive reverse pivot shift, so if I see a large reverse pivot shift, I should verify posterolateral involvement alongside PCL laxity [^111qT4Mq] [^114QSXJg].

> But wait, what if rotational instability seems discordant; I should double-check the dial test setup because tibial positioning matters — applying an anterior force to a PCL-PLC–deficient knee during dial testing can artificially increase external rotation, potentially leading to overestimation of PLC laxity, so I must standardize tibial AP positioning when comparing 30° and 90° flexion [^111E7ymX].

> Next, I should review MRI to confirm morphology and associated injuries, but I need to ensure I do not over-rely on MRI in chronic or recurrent cases where a scarred, elongated PCL may appear "intact"; a sagittal T2 AP diameter ≥ 7 mm (native ≤ 6 mm in most uninjured knees) and increased intraligamentous signal on fat-suppressed PD images suggest PCL tearing, bone bruise patterns are common acutely, and I must avoid the "buckled PCL sign" pitfall, which actually indicates anterior tibial translation from an ACL tear rather than PCL deficiency [^112TGBTQ].

> Let me consider the biomechanical and clinical implications of missed or undertreated PCL insufficiency; in vitro work shows substantial increases in posterior tibial translation during flexion after PCL sectioning and altered patellofemoral mechanics, and both PCL deficiency and even reconstructed states can carry elevated patellofemoral contact pressures under load, which may explain persistent anterior knee pain and downstream degenerative changes if posterior laxity remains [^116amuXZ] [^113BokMD].

> I should confirm grading and integrate treatment decision thresholds carefully: partial tears with PTT up to roughly 10 mm are typically managed nonoperatively initially, while complete tears with PTT > 10 mm or side-to-side difference > 8 mm on stress radiographs, particularly with symptoms or high-demand athletes, merit operative consideration, and when PLC or PMC injuries coexist, stabilizing all injured structures is essential to restore posterior and rotatory stability and protect the PCL graft from overload [^115oKbuH] [^115PuCRb] [^11528SQr].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about reconstruction configuration without context; double-bundle PCL reconstruction more closely restores native laxity across the arc of motion biomechanically and has shown small advantages in posterior laxity reduction clinically, though long-term outcome differences can be modest and technique-specific, so graft choice, tunnel positioning, and addressing concomitant PLC/PMC pathology may be as critical as bundle number in achieving stability [^117VfnB4] [^111xGsxG] [^11528SQr].

> Finally, I will synthesize the clinical pathway to minimize missed combined injuries: history raising PCL suspicion prompts bilateral neutral posterior drawer, followed by posterior drawer in internal and external rotation to screen PMC and PLC contributions, then objective quantification with posterior stress radiography, MRI confirmation of tear characteristics and associated lesions while avoiding "buckled PCL" misreads, and a graded decision toward nonoperative care for low-grade isolated tears versus operative stabilization when translation exceeds thresholds or when combined peripheral injuries are present, ensuring I re-check any contradictory findings before finalizing the plan [^115oKbuH] [^1145KDZ6] [^112TGBTQ] [^115PuCRb].

The posterior drawer test is the **primary clinical test for PCL stability** [^114QSXJg], assessing posterior tibial translation at 90° of knee flexion. Grade I: **0–5 mm**, Grade II: **6–10 mm**, and Grade III: **> 10 mm** indicate increasing instability [^115oKbuH]. Accuracy is highest at **90° of flexion** and findings should be compared with the contralateral knee [^114QSXJg]. The quadriceps active test and posterior sag sign are useful adjuncts [^114QSXJg], while stress radiography [^1145KDZ6] and MRI [^112TGBTQ] provide objective confirmation and grading.

## Clinical tests for PCL stability

---

### Posterior drawer test

- **Description**: The primary clinical test for PCL stability, performed with the patient supine, knee flexed to 90°, and foot stabilized. The examiner applies a posterior force to the proximal tibia, assessing posterior tibial translation relative to the femur [^115oKbuH] [^11144WY7].

- **Grading**: Posterior translation is graded as follows [^115oKbuH]:

| **Grade** | **Translation** | **Clinical interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| I | 0–5 mm | Mild instability |
| II | 6–10 mm | Moderate instability |
| III | > 10 mm | Severe instability |

- **Accuracy**: The posterior drawer test is most accurate at 90° of knee flexion, where posterior tibial translation is maximal [^114QSXJg].

- **Limitations**: The test may be less reliable in acute injuries due to pain, swelling, or muscle guarding, and in chronic injuries due to adaptive changes [^114QSXJg].

---

### Quadriceps active test

In the quadriceps active test, the patient lies supine with the knee flexed to 90° and the foot stabilized, then contracts the quadriceps, producing anterior tibial translation if the PCL is deficient. A **positive test** indicates **PCL deficiency**, as quadriceps contraction compensates for the lack of posterior restraint [^114QSXJg].

---

### Posterior sag sign

For the posterior sag sign, with the patient supine and knees flexed to 90°, the examiner observes tibial position relative to the femur; posterior sag indicates **PCL deficiency**. Clinically, it is a **simple and reliable** indicator of PCL instability [^114QSXJg].

---

### Dial test

The dial test assesses rotational instability associated with combined PCL and posterolateral corner (PLC) injuries and is performed at 30° and 90° of knee flexion, comparing external rotation with the contralateral knee [^111E7ymX]. Increased external rotation at **90°** suggests **PCL involvement**, whereas increased rotation at both **30° and 90°** indicates combined PCL and PLC injury [^11528SQr] [^111qT4Mq].

---

## Imaging modalities for PCL stability assessment

---

### Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

- **Accuracy**: MRI is highly sensitive and specific for acute PCL injuries, with reported accuracy up to 100% [^112TGBTQ].

- **Limitations**: MRI may be less accurate in chronic injuries due to scar formation or healed but insufficient ligaments [^112TGBTQ].

- **Clinical utility**: MRI provides detailed visualization of the PCL and associated structures, aiding in diagnosis and treatment planning [^112TGBTQ].

---

### Stress radiography

Stress radiography objectively quantifies posterior tibial translation, providing a reliable measure of PCL instability. It is particularly **useful in chronic or complex injuries**, where clinical examination may be less reliable [^1145KDZ6].

---

## Biomechanical considerations

The PCL consists of **two bundles**, the anterolateral (ALB) and posteromedial (PMB), which function synergistically to restrain posterior tibial translation and resist rotational instability [^115pAsC9] [^116r8kTH] [^112TGBTQ]. Injury to the PCL alters knee kinematics, increasing posterior tibial translation and patellofemoral contact pressures, potentially leading to degenerative changes [^116amuXZ] [^113BokMD].

---

## Clinical implications of PCL instability

PCL instability **significantly impacts knee function**, causing pain, instability, and reduced quality of life [^113q5zDe]. Chronic PCL deficiency can lead to degenerative changes, particularly in the patellofemoral and medial compartments [^116amuXZ]. Treatment decisions depend on the severity of instability, patient activity level, and associated injuries.

---

## Summary of PCL stability assessment

| **Test** | **Clinical utility** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Posterior drawer | Primary test for posterior instability | Less reliable in acute/chronic injuries |
| Quadriceps active | Confirms PCL deficiency | Requires patient cooperation |
| Posterior sag | Simple indicator of PCL instability | Subjective |
| Dial test | Assesses rotational instability | Complex injuries |
| MRI | Highly accurate for acute injuries | Less accurate in chronic injuries |
| Stress radiography | Objective quantification of instability | Radiation exposure |

The posterior drawer test is the **primary clinical test for PCL stability**, assessing posterior tibial translation at 90° of knee flexion [^114QSXJg]. **Grade I: 0–5 mm**, **Grade II: 6–10 mm**, and **Grade III: > 10 mm** indicate increasing instability [^115oKbuH]. **Accuracy is highest at 90° of flexion** and findings should be compared with the contralateral knee [^114QSXJg]. The quadriceps active test and posterior sag sign are useful adjuncts [^114QSXJg], while stress radiography [^1145KDZ6] and MRI [^112TGBTQ] provide objective confirmation and grading.

Despite reliable clinical tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) continues to be the most accurate diagnostic modality to identify isolated and combined PCL injuries. Although the sensitivity and specificity of acute PCL injuries are reported to be up to 100%, this is not applicable for chronic and recurring PCL injuries, since scar formation or healing in a stretched, insufficient conformation may incorrectly portray an intact appearance of the PCL.

The AP diameter, as measured on sagittal T2-weighted MRI scans, of the native PCL has been shown to be ≤ 6 mm in 92% of patients without a history of knee trauma. In surgically confirmed PCL tears, the corresponding AP diameter was found to be ≥ 7 mm in 94% of patients. An increased AP diameter (≥ 7 mm) on sagittal T2-weighted images is, therefore, indicative of PCL injuries.

Another sign of PCL tears is an increased intraligamentary signal intensity on fat-suppressed proton-density MR images, which may appear in a longitudinal striated configuration. A buckled conformation of the PCL seen on sagittal MR images mimics a slack appearance of the PCL and is caused by anterior displacement of the tibia. However, the buckled PCL sign is a secondary sign of ACL tears and should not be misinterpreted as a sign of PCL deficiency.

Specific bone bruise patterns are considered to be secondary signs of ligamentous knee injuries, which additionally provide insights into the injury mechanism. Acute isolated PCL injuries and combined PCL and PLC injuries have been associated with a bone bruise in more than 80% of patients.

### Stress radiography for the diagnosis of knee ligament injuries: a systematic review [^1145KDZ6]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2014). Low credibility.

Stress radiography is a widely used diagnostic tool to assess injury to the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments and the medial and lateral structures of the knee. However, numerous techniques have been reported in the literature with no clear consensus on which methodology is best for assessing ligament stability.

- **Questions/purposes**: The purpose of this review was to identify which stress radiographic techniques have support in the literature for the diagnosis of acute or chronic knee ligament injuries. It also aimed to define which technique is most accurate and reliable for diagnosing knee ligament injuries and to compare the use of stress radiography with other diagnostic tests.

- **Methods**: Two independent reviewers performed a systematic review of PubMed (MEDLINE), the EMBASE library, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register for English language studies published from January 1970 to August 2013 on the diagnosis of knee ligament injuries using stress radiography. Information describing the ligament(s) investigated, stress radiographic technique, magnitude of force, measures of accuracy and reliability, and comparative diagnostic tests were extracted. Risk of bias was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool.

- **Results**: A total of 16 stress techniques were described for stress radiography of the knee. The diagnostic accuracy of stress radiography, including sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values, varied considerably depending on the technique and choice of displacement or gapping threshold. Excellent reliability was reported for the techniques examined.

In the authors' approach (PWW, VM), the posterior drawer test is performed in internal, neutral, and external rotation of the tibia to assess additional injuries of the peripheral capsuloligamentous structures since biomechanical studies have shown that the structures of the PMC and PLC are secondary restraints against internal and external tibial torque, respectively. Furthermore, all PCL injuries are classified according to the classifications proposed by the American Medical Association, Hughston and colleagues, and Harner et al. Grade I and II injuries are considered partial tears involving ligament strain or individual fiber disruption, quantified by a PTT of 10 mm. All tests are performed bilaterally to evaluate side-to-side differences and are complemented by the assessment of generalized hyperlaxity based on the Beighton scoring system.

### Evolving evidence in the treatment of primary and recurrent posterior cruciate ligament injuries, part 2: Surgical techniques, outcomes and rehabilitation [^117VfnB4]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021).

- **Clinical outcomes following PCL-R**: Biomechanical studies have demonstrated that only anatomic double-bundle (DB) PCL-R is able to restore native knee laxity across the entire range of motion, whereas single-bundle (SB) PCL-R leads to residual posterior laxity. Consequently, several clinical studies have advocated for DB PCL-R, demonstrating improved clinical and functional outcomes compared to SB PCL-R.

A randomized controlled trial comparing isolated SB (n = 22) and DB (n = 24) allograft PCL-R reported significant improvements in patient-reported outcomes. Improvements were noted in the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Form, Lysholm Score, and Tegner Activity Scale, along with reduced knee laxity (KT-1000) for both techniques with a minimum of two years of follow-up. The DB group showed superior results in knee laxity and objective and subjective IKDC compared to the SB group.

Another randomized controlled trial showed similar results, with significantly less residual posterior tibial translation (PTT) measured on posterior stress radiographs in patients undergoing isolated DB (n = 28) PCL-R compared to SB (n = 25) PCL-R. However, the authors questioned the clinical relevance of the statistically significant difference of 1.4 mm between the groups. Accordingly, no difference in clinical and radiological outcomes, failure, and survival rates between SB (n = 28) and DB (n = 36) PCL-R could be observed in long-term follow-up, with a minimum of 10 years.

### Evolving evidence in the treatment of primary and recurrent posterior cruciate ligament injuries, part 1: anatomy, biomechanics and diagnostics [^11528SQr]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

A considerable part of the literature focuses on how to best restore native PCL biomechanics in a manner that translates to clinical success following operative treatment of PCL injured patients. Biomechanical studies have reported anatomic double-bundle (DB) PCL reconstruction (PCL-R) to provide superior restoration of knee laxity and kinematics compared to anatomic single-bundle (SB) reconstruction. Anatomic DB PCL-R has been shown to be superior to anatomic SB PCL-R in providing restraint to posterior tibial translation (PTT) between 15° and 120°, and internal rotation above 90° of knee flexion. Conversely, results published by another investigation have raised the concern that tensions exerted on the posteromedial bundle (PMB) graft fixed at 30° during DB PCL-R result in excessively restricted residual anterior-posterior (AP) translation of the knee, while the SB technique provides a superior replication of the native knee laxity.

- **Fig. 3**:
	- Right knee from a posterior view demonstrating single-bundle vs. double-bundle posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (PCL-R).
	- a: Transtibial single-bundle PCL-R.
	- **B**: Transtibial double-bundle PCL-R.

The structures of the posterolateral corner (PLC) of the knee, including the lateral collateral ligament, popliteus tendon, and popliteofibular ligament (Fig. 1), have been identified as restraints against PTT, varus torque, and tibial external rotation and, therefore, act synergistically with the PCL. Increased in situ forces of the intact PCL have been demonstrated in externally loaded, isolated PLC-deficient knees, indicating the importance of detecting and treating PLC injuries concurrently with PCL-R.

### How well do anatomical reconstructions of the posterolateral corner restore varus stability to the posterior cruciate ligament-reconstructed knee [^114mTW78]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

With grade 3 posterolateral injuries of the knee, reconstructions of the lateral collateral ligament, popliteus tendon, and popliteofibular ligament are commonly performed in conjunction with a posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction to restore knee stability.

- **Hypothesis**: A lateral collateral ligament reconstruction, alone or with a popliteus tendon or popliteofibular ligament reconstruction, will produce normal varus rotation patterns and restore posterior cruciate ligament graft forces to normal levels in response to an applied varus moment.

- **Study design**: Controlled laboratory study.

- **Methods**: Forces in the native posterior cruciate ligament were recorded for 15 intact knees during passive extension from 120 degrees to 0 degrees with an applied 5 N.m varus moment. The posterior cruciate ligament was removed and reconstructed with a single bundle inlay graft tensioned to restore intact knee laxity at 90 degrees. Posterior cruciate ligament graft force, varus rotation, and tibial rotation were recorded before and following a grade 3 posterolateral corner injury. Testing was repeated with lateral collateral ligament, lateral collateral ligament plus popliteus tendon, and lateral collateral ligament plus popliteofibular ligament graft reconstructions; all grafts were tensioned to 30 N at 30 degrees with the tibia locked in neutral rotation.

- **Results**: All three posterolateral graft combinations rotated the tibia into slight valgus as the knee was taken through a passive range of motion. During the varus test, popliteus tendon and popliteofibular ligament reconstructions showed distinct outcomes…

### Knee kinematics in anterior cruciate ligament-substituting arthroplasty with or without the posterior cruciate ligament [^112mv6nJ]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2013). Low credibility.

Few studies have compared functional kinematics in knees using identical prostheses with or without the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). This study contrasted in vivo knee kinematics with an anterior cruciate ligament-substituting arthroplasty with and without PCL retention. We hypothesized that knees without PCLs would exhibit less femoral posterior translation and consequently less maximum knee flexion.

Fifty-six knees were studied using dynamic radiography at least one year post-surgery, with twenty-seven knees retaining the PCL and twenty-nine knees having the PCL sacrificed. Consistent with our hypothesis, PCL-sacrificing knees showed more anterior femoral condylar positions. Contrary to our hypothesis, PCL-sacrificing knees demonstrated greater knee flexion during kneeling (122° versus 115°). Contracted PCLs in severely deformed knees likely were the cause of limited flexion in some retaining knees.

### Evolving evidence in the treatment of primary and recurrent posterior cruciate ligament injuries, part 1: Anatomy, biomechanics and diagnostics [^113a4vGX]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) represents an intra-articular structure composed of two distinct bundles. Considering the anterior and posterior meniscofemoral ligaments, a total of four ligamentous fiber bundles of the posterior knee complex act synergistically to restrain posterior and rotatory tibial loads. Injury mechanisms associated with high-energy trauma and accompanying injury patterns may complicate diagnostic evaluation and accuracy. Therefore, a thorough and systematic diagnostic workup is necessary to assess the severity of the PCL injury and to initiate an appropriate treatment approach. Since structural damage to the PCL occurs in more than one-third of trauma patients experiencing acute knee injury with hemarthrosis, background knowledge for management of PCL injuries is important. In part 1 of the evidence-based update on management of primary and recurrent PCL injuries, the anatomical, biomechanical, and diagnostic principles are presented. This paper aims to convey the anatomical and biomechanical knowledge needed for accurate diagnosis, facilitating subsequent decision-making in the treatment of PCL injuries.

### Posterior cruciate ligament rupture alters in vitro knee kinematics [^116amuXZ]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2002). Low credibility.

Isolated posterior cruciate ligament injuries are usually treated nonoperatively, although some patients remain symptomatic, and degenerative changes within the patellofemoral joint and the medial compartment of the tibiofemoral joint have been observed in follow-up studies. An in vitro simulation of knee squatting was conducted to quantify the influence of the posterior cruciate ligament on tibiofemoral and patellofemoral kinematics. For five knee specimens, knee kinematics were measured before and after sectioning the posterior cruciate ligament and compared using a Wilcoxon signed rank test.

- **Kinematic parameters**:
	- Only the tibial posterior translation and patellar flexion changed significantly after sectioning the posterior cruciate ligament. The posterior translation of the tibia increased significantly between 25 degrees and 90 degrees of flexion. The average increase in posterior translation exceeded 10 mm at 90 degrees of flexion. Patellar flexion increased significantly from 30 degrees to 90 degrees of flexion, with the average patellar flexion increase peaking at 4.4 degrees at 45 degrees of flexion.

Increased tibial translation could adversely influence joint stability. Increased patellar flexion could elevate the pressure within the patellofemoral joint, especially at the inferior pole, leading to degenerative changes within the patellofemoral joint.

### A comprehensive meta-analysis of clinical and biomechanical outcomes comparing double-bundle and single-bundle posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction techniques [^111xGsxG]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reconstruction techniques have historically focused on single-bundle (SB) reconstruction of the larger anterolateral bundle without addressing the codominant posteromedial bundle. The SB technique has been associated with residual laxity and instability, which led to the development of double-bundle (DB) reconstruction techniques.

- **Purpose**: To perform a meta-analysis of comparative clinical and biomechanical studies to differentiate the pooled outcomes of SB and DB PCL reconstruction cohorts.

- **Study Design**: Meta-analysis and systematic review; level of evidence, 3.

- **Methods**: Six databases were queried in February 2022 for literature directly comparing clinical and biomechanical outcomes for patients or cadaveric specimens undergoing DB PCL reconstruction against SB PCL reconstruction. Biomechanical outcomes included posterior tibial translational laxity, external rotational laxity, and varus laxity at 30° and 90° of knee flexion. Clinical outcomes included the side-to-side difference in posterior tibial translation during postoperative stress radiographs, the risk of a major complication, and the following postoperative patient-reported outcome measures: Lysholm, Tegner, and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective and objective scores. A random-effects model was used to compare pooled clinical and biomechanical outcomes between the cohorts.

- **Results**: Fifteen biomechanical studies and 13 clinical studies were included in this meta-analysis. The DB group demonstrated significantly less posterior tibial translation.

### Gait adaptations at 8 years after reconstruction of unilateral isolated and combined posterior cruciate ligament injuries [^112ysFUH]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The study found no side-to-side differences in the PCL group for any of the spatiotemporal or kinematic parameters. The lack of differences between limbs in the PCL group aligns with previous investigations of self-paced walking in patients at 4 years after untreated unilateral isolated PCL injuries, as well as in patients approximately 3 years after unilateral isolated PCL or multiple knee ligament reconstruction. Conversely, some side-to-side kinetic differences were observed. Notably, reconstructed limbs of the PCL group displayed smaller peak knee flexion moments during early stance compared with contralateral limbs, corroborating findings previously reported in patients at 3 years after unilateral multiple knee ligament reconstruction. While the aforementioned study observed a 19% side-to-side difference in peak knee flexion moments, the present analysis noted only a 7% difference. This discrepancy is likely explained by the heterogeneity of the injured structures between samples. In the study by Hart et al, only 80% of patients underwent PCL reconstruction, and most (20/25) also had ACL involvement. In the current study, 100% of patients underwent PCL reconstruction, and only about a third (8/26) also had ACL involvement. Moreover, reconstructed limbs of the PCL group displayed smaller peak knee external rotation moments during early stance, likely attributable to the smaller knee flexion moments, as well as smaller peak hip extension moments during late stance compared with contralateral limbs.

### A 10-year prospective trial of a patient management algorithm and screening examination for highly active individuals with anterior cruciate ligament injury: Part 2, determinants of dynamic knee stability [^114VAva2]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

To clarify the determinants of dynamic knee stability early after anterior cruciate ligament injury, this study used a cohort study design (diagnosis) with a level of evidence of 1.

Three hundred forty-five consecutive patients who were regular participants in International Knee Documentation Committee level I/II sports before injury and had an acute isolated anterior cruciate ligament injury from the practice of a single orthopedic surgeon underwent a screening examination. This included clinical measures, knee laxity, quadriceps strength, hop testing, and patient self-reported knee function, conducted a mean of 6 weeks after injury when impairments were resolved. Independent t tests were performed to evaluate differences in quadriceps strength and anterior knee laxity between potential copers and noncopers. Hierarchical regression was performed to determine the influence of quadriceps strength, preinjury activity level, and anterior knee laxity on hop test performance, as well as the influence of timed hop, crossover hop, quadriceps strength, preinjury activity level, and anterior knee laxity on self-assessed global function.

Results indicated that neither anterior knee laxity nor quadriceps strength differed between potential copers and noncopers. Quadriceps strength influenced hop test performance more significantly than did preinjury activity level or anterior knee laxity, but the variance accounted for by quadriceps strength was low (range, 4%-8%). Timed hop performance was the only variable that affected self-assessed global function.

Traditional surgical decision making based on these parameters should be reconsidered.

### Rehabilitation versus surgical reconstruction for non-acute anterior cruciate ligament injury (ACL SNNAP): a pragmatic randomised controlled trial [^114crzEC]. Lancet (2022). High credibility.

The disease of anterior cruciate ligament injury can be associated with various clinical symptoms and signs. These include knee instability, a positive pivot shift test, involvement in sports, medial collateral ligament tear, knee tenderness, hemarthrosis, knee pain, knee effusion, gait disturbance, and swelling. It may also lead to an ACL tear, inability to walk, a positive anterior drawer test, decreased knee range of motion (ROM), meniscal tear, and other conditions such as adolescents with segond fracture, genu valgum, and a positive patellar glide test and Lachman test.

### Evolving evidence in the treatment of primary and recurrent posterior cruciate ligament injuries, part 2: surgical techniques, outcomes and rehabilitation [^114UWM8w]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

Isolated and combined posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries are associated with severe limitations in daily, professional, and sports activities, as well as with devastating long-term effects for the knee joint. As the number of primary and recurrent PCL injuries increases, so does the body of literature, with high-quality evidence evolving in recent years. However, the debate about the ideal treatment approach, such as operative vs. non-operative; single-bundle vs. double-bundle reconstruction; transtibial vs. tibial inlay technique, continues. Ultimately, the goal in the treatment of PCL injuries is restoring native knee kinematics and preventing residual posterior and combined rotatory knee laxity through an individualized approach.

Certain demographic, anatomical, and surgical risk factors for failures in operative treatment have been identified. Failures after PCL reconstruction are increasing, confronting the treating surgeon with challenges, including the need for revision PCL reconstruction. Part 2 of the evidence-based update on the management of primary and recurrent PCL injuries will summarize the outcomes of operative and non-operative treatment, including indications, surgical techniques, complications, and risk factors for recurrent PCL deficiency. This paper aims to support surgeons in decision-making for the treatment of PCL injuries by systematically evaluating underlying risk factors, thus preventing postoperative complications and recurrent knee laxity.

### Evolving evidence in the treatment of primary and recurrent posterior cruciate ligament injuries, part 1: anatomy, biomechanics and diagnostics [^112fG382]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

A thorough and systematic diagnostic workup, including patient history, standardized clinical knee examination, and imaging, is essential for each patient to precisely identify posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and concomitant ligamentous, meniscal, and cartilage injuries for appropriate and individualized treatment decision-making.

Obtaining detailed information about the patient's medical history, injury mechanism, chief complaint, as well as social, professional, and athletic demands, is crucial. Typically, patients presenting with PCL injuries are aged between 20 and 35 years and have a history of high-energy trauma caused by a motor vehicle or sport-related injury. More precisely, a posterior-directed force acting on the proximal tibia leads to posterior tibial translation, ultimately causing a disruption of the PCL. Other injury mechanisms include hyperflexion and hyperextension, which are associated with a proximal tear location and anterior tibial plateau compression fractures. Excessive varus, valgus, internal, or external torque of the tibia are also mechanisms that may relate to concomitant injuries of peripheral capsuloligamentous structures, menisci, and cartilage.

Clinically, patients primarily report pain or discomfort after an acute PCL injury. The pain commonly affects the patellofemoral, anteromedial, or posterior part of the knee and occurs during uphill or downhill walks. Unlike in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) deficiency, patients with isolated PCL tears rarely report symptoms of instability. However, the perception of instability becomes more pronounced in chronic and combined injuries.

### Evolving evidence in the treatment of primary and recurrent posterior cruciate ligament injuries, part 1: anatomy, biomechanics and diagnostics [^115pAsC9]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

Anatomical studies have increased awareness of the bundle configuration and insertion zones of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and their close relationship to the meniscofemoral ligaments (MFLs). Biomechanical studies further demonstrate the length and orientation change patterns of the individual PCL bundles, highlighting their codominant and synergistic functions. Specifically, the anterolateral bundle (ALB) is the larger and more important bundle, most commonly reconstructed in single-bundle PCL reconstruction (PCL-R) surgery. Double-bundle reconstructions are biomechanically superior and may be utilized in cases with chronic high-grade posterior instability. Extended basic knowledge can be translated into improved diagnostic workup, thus facilitating an individual treatment approach.

### Injuries of the posterior cruciate ligament and posterolateral corner of the knee [^113Pt7do]. Injury (2006). Low credibility.

Injuries of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and posterolateral corner (PLC) of the knee are less common than those of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), and their significance is often underappreciated in the acute setting. Even when recognized, knowledge of the natural history and outcomes of treatment has lagged behind the understanding of ACL injuries, leading to confusion regarding the indications for operative treatment.

Recent developments in the understanding of the anatomy and biomechanics of this knee area have led to improvements in management and renewed interest in these potentially disabling injuries. This review aims to update trauma generalists on these recent developments and improve diagnosis through heightened suspicion and the use of appropriate special investigations. The principles of managing both isolated and combined injuries to the PCL and PLC, in both acute and chronic settings, are described.

### Posterior cruciate ligament injuries: What do we really know [^116tYcY9]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

While the concept of anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction has not been proven to be superior to individualized anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction, this may be different for PCL reconstruction. There is biomechanical evidence demonstrating favorable results in restoring native knee kinematics and laxity for double-bundle versus single-bundle PCL reconstruction. Double-bundle PCL reconstruction requires thorough anatomical knowledge for accurate tunnel placement, and although biomechanical evidence exists, clinical proof of its superiority over single-bundle PCL reconstruction is still pending. Accordingly, the concept of graft configuration (single bundle vs. double bundle) may be of secondary importance, while the graft choice (autograft vs. allograft) may be of primary importance. At least in ACL reconstruction, autografts, especially quadriceps tendon autografts, are becoming increasingly popular due to low surgical graft failure rates.

### Different patient and activity-related characteristics result in different injury profiles for patients with anterior cruciate ligament and posterior cruciate ligament injuries [^111zdDCU]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). High credibility.

Injuries to the cruciate ligaments, including anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) tears, are severe injuries affecting athletes' ability to return to sport. Previous studies have demonstrated a higher incidence of PCL injuries in men, while female athletes appear to run a greater risk of sustaining an ACL injury. Furthermore, ACL injuries are reported to occur more commonly in young high-level female athletes, whereas males affected by an ACL injury are reported to be somewhat older. A higher body mass index (BMI) has also been related to an increased risk of sustaining cruciate ligament injuries and has been reported to be an important contributory factor in combined knee ligament injuries.

Additionally, different injury profiles of knee ligament injuries have been linked to different types of injury mechanisms. ACL injuries have usually been associated with non-contact sports, and PCL injuries with high-energy trauma. Consequently, PCL injuries more frequently coincide with additional knee ligament tears, while ACL injuries more often occur with concomitant meniscal lesions.

Despite the rising incidence of cruciate ligament injuries and their negative impact on both sports participation and general knee function, the specific injury profiles for ACL and PCL injuries are yet to be described. The purpose of this study was to explore and compare patient characteristics, including patient sex, age, BMI, and activity at the time of injury, as well as injury profiles in patients undergoing either ACL or PCL reconstruction.

### Functional assessments for decision-making regarding return to sports following ACL reconstruction. Part II: Clinical application of a new test battery [^1114pRE9]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2015). Low credibility.

In this test battery, over 90% of the patients achieved values within the "norm" compared to the healthy controls on the stability tests. Webster et al. demonstrated that subjects with an ACL-reconstructed knee have inferior stabilizing abilities compared to the abilities of healthy controls even 2.5 years after surgery. Their findings are supported by other researchers. A systematic review by Howells et al. found high discrepancies for the stability and postural performance of patients following ACL reconstruction. They documented that ACL surgery leads to limitations in the single-legged and two-legged stability tests, which is in good accordance with our data.

Most studies investigating the neuromuscular outcome following ACL surgery use various hop tests. Myklebust et al. found that even professional athletes, with their extensive rehabilitation and training programs, have deficits in hop test performance in the reconstructed limb compared to the performance on the uninjured side. Furthermore, the hop test performance correlates with the ability for a return to play.

A test battery for determining a "safe" return to play must assess postural abilities and hop tests as well as speed and muscle strength testing.

This study has several limitations. This pilot study included only a limited number of subjects, and no standardized clinical data in terms of knee scores or instrumented ACL laxity tests were gathered. To show a positive influence regarding re-rupture, a higher number of patients and longer follow-up are needed.

### The pivot shift [^1174xCKJ]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2008). Low credibility.

The Lachman and the pivot shift are the two clinical tests most commonly used to assess instability in the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)-deficient knee. Because it is quantifiable, the Lachman test has become the benchmark for assessing the success of ACL reconstruction. As a result, surgical techniques have been developed that effectively eliminate anterior laxity of the knee. Recent studies have shown, however, that rotational stability is not always restored after ACL reconstruction.

Furthermore, there is mounting evidence that the pivot shift examination correlates with functional instability and patient outcomes better than does any other physical examination test. This test attempts to reproduce the functional combined rotary and translational instability in the ACL-deficient knee. Although the pathologic kinematics of the pivot shift are difficult to measure, recent technological advances have allowed more accurate and objective descriptions of the pivot shift, which have furthered our understanding of the complex motions involved. These advances may lead to a method of quantifying the pivot shift for research purposes and, ultimately, to ACL reconstruction that is tailored specifically to each patient's objectively measured rotational instability.

### Restriction of posterior tibial translation during the posterior drawer test in internal or external rotation is dependent on peripheral stabilizers of the knee: A biomechanical robotic investigation [^11144WY7]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Ruptures of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) frequently occur in combination with injuries of the posterolateral or posteromedial structures. The posterolateral complex comprises the lateral collateral ligament (LCL) and arcuate complex, consisting of the popliteus tendon (PT), popliteofibular ligament (PFL), and auxiliary structures. The posteromedial complex comprises the medial collateral ligament (MCL), the posterior oblique ligament (POL), the posteromedial capsule, and the semimembranosus tendon. It is generally accepted that the PCL is the primary restraint to posterior tibial translation (PTT). However, both the posterolateral and posteromedial complexes have previously been shown to restrict PTT when injured in isolation or in combination with the PCL. Based on anatomic and biomechanical observations, the posteromedial structures tighten in internal rotation and may therefore better restrict PTT in internal rotation, while the posterolateral structures tighten in external rotation and may therefore restrict PTT better in external rotation.

Clinically, injuries of the PCL are typically evaluated using the posterior drawer test. Additionally, the posterior drawer test in internal and external rotation was proposed as a clinical evaluation to differentiate between isolated PCL tears and combined posteromedial and posterolateral instability. However, the specific influence of the peripheral structures on restricting PTT in internal or external rotation is unclear thus far.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of the peripheral structures on posterior tibial translation during the posterior drawer test.

### Gait adaptations at 8 years after reconstruction of unilateral isolated and combined posterior cruciate ligament injuries [^113QTZS8]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

It remains unclear how posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reconstruction influences long-term lower extremity joint biomechanics.

- **Purpose**: To determine whether patients who underwent PCL reconstruction exhibited long-term alterations in lower limb gait mechanics.

- **Study design**: Controlled laboratory study.

- **Methods**: A total of 26 patients underwent gait analyses at 8.2 ± 2.6 years after primary unilateral PCL reconstruction. Sex- and age-matched healthy controls were analyzed for comparison. Gait data were collected using motion capture and force plates. Hip, knee, and ankle angles and moments were compared during initial contact, early stance, and late stance for the reconstructed and uninjured contralateral limbs of patients who underwent PCL reconstruction (PCL group) as well as the limbs of healthy control participants (CON group).

- **Results**: No side-to-side kinematic differences were noted between the reconstructed and contralateral limbs of the PCL group; some trivial differences were noted in knee and hip moments. However, major differences between the PCL and CON groups occurred at the knee. Reconstructed and contralateral limbs of the PCL group exhibited larger knee flexion angles during initial contact (Δ = 7.0° [P < .001] and Δ = 6.9° [P < .001], respectively), early stance (Δ = 5.8° [P = 0.003] and Δ = 6.7° [P < .001], respectively), and late stance (Δ = 7.9° [P < .001] and Δ = 8.0° [P < .001], respectively) compared with the CON group. During early stance, contralateral limbs of the PCL group displayed larger knee flexion moments (Δ = 0.20 N·m/k

### Effect of tibial positioning on the diagnosis of posterolateral rotatory instability in the posterior cruciate ligament-deficient knee [^111E7ymX]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

To determine whether the positioning of the tibia affects the degree of tibial external rotation observed during a dial test in a posterior cruciate ligament (PCL)-posterolateral corner (PLC)-deficient knee, a laboratory investigation was conducted in a biomechanics laboratory. The hypothesis was that an anterior force applied to the tibia in the combined PCL-PLC-deficient knee would result in increased tibial external rotation during a dial test.

The methods involved measuring the degree of tibial external rotation with 5 Nm of external rotation torque applied to the tibia at both 30 degrees and 90 degrees of knee flexion. Before the torque application, an anterior force, a posterior force, or a neutral force was applied to the tibia. External rotation measurements were repeated after the sequential sectioning of the PCL, the posterolateral structures, and the fibular collateral ligament (FCL).

Baseline testing of the intact specimens demonstrated a mean external rotation of 18.6 degrees with the knee flexed to 30 degrees (range 16.1–21.0 degrees) and a mean external rotation of 17.3 degrees with the knee flexed to 90 degrees (range 13.8–20.0 degrees). Sequential sectioning of the PCL, popliteus and popliteofibular ligament, and the FCL led to a significant increase in tibial external rotation compared with the intact knee for all testing scenarios. After sectioning the popliteus and popliteofibular ligament, an anterior force application during testing resulted in a mean tibial external rotation that was 5 degrees greater than during testing in the neutral condition.

### Posterior cruciate ligament and posterolateral corner deficiency results in a reverse pivot shift [^111qT4Mq]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2012). Low credibility.

As measured via static stability tests, the PCL is the dominant restraint to posterior tibial translation while the posterolateral corner is the dominant restraint to external tibial rotation. However, these uniplanar static tests may not predict multiplanar instability. The reverse pivot shift is a dynamic examination maneuver that may identify complex knee instability.

- **Questions/purposes**: In this cadaver study, we asked whether (1) isolated sectioning or (2) combined sectioning of the PCL and posterolateral corner increased the magnitude of the reverse pivot shift and (3) the magnitude of the reverse pivot shift correlated with static external rotation or posterior drawer testing.

- **Methods**: In Group I, we sectioned the PCL followed by structures of the posterolateral corner. In Group II, we sectioned the posterolateral corner structures before sectioning the PCL. We performed posterior drawer, external rotation tests, and mechanized reverse pivot shift for each specimen under each condition and measured translations via navigation.

- **Results**: Isolated sectioning of the PCL or posterolateral corner had no effect on the reverse pivot shift. Conversely, combined sectioning of the PCL and posterolateral corner structures increased the magnitude of the reverse pivot shift. The magnitude of the reverse pivot shift correlated with the posterior drawer and external rotation tests.

- **Conclusions**: Combined sectioning of the PCL and posterolateral corner was required to cause an increase in the magnitude of the mechanized reverse pivot shift.

### Graft tension of the posterior cruciate ligament using a finite element model [^111F2quD]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2014). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to analyze the change in length and tension of the reconstructed single-bundle posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) with three different femoral tunnels at different knee flexion angles using a three-dimensional finite element method.

The right knees of 12 male subjects were scanned with a high-resolution computed tomography scanner at four different knee flexion angles (0°, 45°, 90°, and 135°). Three types of single-bundle PCL reconstruction were then conducted in a 90° flexion model: femoral tunnels were created in anterolateral (AL), central, and posteromedial (PM) regions of the footprint. Length versus flexion curves and tension versus flexion curves were generated.

Between 0° and 90° of knee flexion, changes in length and tension in the PM grafts were not significant, whereas the lengths and tension of the AL and central grafts significantly increased in the same flexion range. The length and tension of the PM grafts at 135° of knee flexion were significantly higher than those at 90° of knee flexion, whereas the AL and the central grafts showed only slight length changes beyond 90° of flexion. However, the tension of the AL graft increased significantly beyond 90° of flexion.

Changes in graft length and tension were generally affected by different femoral tunnels and knee flexion angles. In groups with the AL and PM single-bundle reconstruction, the graft tension increased beyond 90° of knee flexion when the graft is tensioned at 90° of flexion.

### Review for the generalist: Evaluation of anterior knee pain [^1128LUof]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

- **Special tests**:
	1. **Patellar tilt test**: The patient is supine with the knee extended. Apply downward pressure to the medial edge of the patella to assess lateral patellar restraints. The test is positive if the patellar tilt angle is more than 5 degrees.

	2. **Medial and lateral patellar glide**: Push the patella medially and laterally, noting the degree of movement relative to the width of the patella. More than 75% translation indicates hypermobility.

	3. **Quadriceps setting/grind test, patellar inhibition**: Apply suprapatellar resistance while the patient performs isometric quadriceps contraction with the knee in full extension. Pain indicates a positive test.

	4. **Patellar compression test**: Directly compress the patella into the trochlea. Pain is indicative of articular cartilage degeneration or acute chondral injury.

	5. **Patellar apprehension test**: Apply lateral pressure to the patella at 30° knee flexion. It is positive if the patient feels instability or pain.

	6. **Lachman test**: This is positive for anterior cruciate insufficiency if there is anterior translation of the tibia on the femur with the knee in 30° flexion.

	7. **Posterior drawer test**: This is positive for posterior cruciate ligament insufficiency if there is posterior translation of the tibia on the femur with the knee in 90° flexion.

	8. **McMurray's test**: Positive for a meniscal tear if there is a palpable or audible click. The patient is supine, flexing the hip to 90° and maximally flexing the knee followed by passive knee extension. First, apply external tibial rotation while applying a varus stress at the knee (for the lateral meniscus), and then internal tibial rotation while applying a valgus stress (for the medial meniscus).

	9. **Trendelenburg test**: Positive.

### Microstructural and mechanical properties of the posterior cruciate ligament: A comparison of the anterolateral and posteromedial bundles [^116r8kTH]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2016). Low credibility.

The microstructural organization, specifically collagen fiber alignment, of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), which likely corresponds with its functional properties, has only been described qualitatively in the literature to our knowledge. This study aimed to quantify the tensile mechanical and microstructural properties of the PCL and compare these qualities between the anterolateral and posteromedial bundles.

- **Methods**: Twenty-two knee specimens from 13 donors (8 male and 5 female; mean age and standard deviation at the time of death, 43.0 ± 4.1 years; mean body mass index, 30.0 ± 6.7 kg/m²) were dissected to isolate the PCL, with each bundle split into three regions. Mechanical testing of each regional sample included preconditioning, followed by a ramp-and-hold stress-relaxation test and a quasi-static ramp-to-failure test. A high-resolution, division-of-focal-plane polarization camera was used for microstructural analysis to evaluate the average direction of collagen orientation and the degree of alignment in that direction. Results were compared between the anterolateral and posteromedial bundles and across the regions of each bundle.

- **Results**: The anterolateral and posteromedial bundles demonstrated largely equivalent mechanical and microstructural properties. Elastic moduli in the toe and linear regions were not different; however, the posteromedial bundle exhibited significantly more stress relaxation (p = 0.004). There were also few differences in microstructural properties between bundles.

### Reconstruction of the posterior oblique ligament and the posterior cruciate ligament in knees with posteromedial instability [^112BqNsZ]. Arthroscopy (2012). Low credibility.

Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries are often associated with injuries to the posteromedial structures of the knee. The study aimed to test different reconstruction techniques for the posteromedial corner's structures in a biomechanical experiment.

- **Methods**: Kinematic studies were conducted on 10 cadaveric knees exposed to a 134-N posterior tibial load, 10-Nm valgus torque, and 5-Nm internal torque at 0°, 30°, 60°, and 90° of flexion. The posterior tibial translation (PTT) was measured using a robotic/universal force-moment sensor testing system for various conditions: (1) intact knees, (2) PCL-deficient knees, (3) knees with deficiencies of both the PCL and the posteromedial structures, (4) knees with only the PCL reconstructed, (5) knees with both the PCL and posterior oblique ligament (POL) reconstructed, and (6) knees with the PCL, medial collateral ligament (MCL), and POL reconstructed. Kinematic data were analyzed using a 2-factor repeated analysis of variance.

- **Results**: When both the PCL and the posteromedial structures were compromised, PTT increased significantly at all flexion angles under a posterior tibial load (P < .05). Additional reconstruction of the POL improved PTT at all flexion angles compared to knees where only the PCL was reconstructed. Reconstruction of the MCL had no significant effect on PTT.

- **Conclusions**: This study demonstrates that recons

### Specific fibre areas in the femoral footprint of the posterior cruciate ligament act as a major contributor in resisting posterior tibial displacement: A biomechanical robotic investigation [^114SuoN4]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). High credibility.

The study examined the sequential cutting of the femoral footprint of the PCL. It was found that the major contributors (> 10% contribution) to the PCL's ability to restrain posterior tibial translation (PTT) force were located at the proximal border of the PCL footprint. These contributors were positioned away from the cartilage border and directly adjacent to the medial intercondylar ridge (Figures 2 and 4).

- **Heatmap visualization**: Figure 4 illustrates the contribution of each cutting step of the femoral footprint of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) in restricting posterior tibial translation at different flexion angles. The contribution of each step is presented as the mean percentage of the total PCL contribution.

Areas 6, 9, 12, and 15 were identified as statistically significant contributors to the restraint of PTT force (Table 1 and Figure 5). Notably, area 12 consistently exhibited the highest contribution (≥ 30%) across all flexion angles. Collectively, areas 6, 9, and 12 contributed between 52.2% and 75.9% from 0° to 90° of flexion. It was not possible to clearly assign these areas to either the anterolateral or posteromedial bundle.

- **Fibre bundles contribution**: Table 1 highlights fibre bundles that significantly contribute to the posterior cruciate ligament's ability to restrain a posterior tibial translation force.

- **Cutting steps contribution**: Figure 5 shows the relative contribution of the cutting steps to the restraining force of the posterior cruciate ligament at different flexion angles. Multiple comparisons were performed against the intact state of the posterior cruciate ligament, with statistical significance considered at p < 0.05.

This investigation improves the understanding of the specific fibre contributions within the femoral footprint of the PCL, particularly emphasizing areas 6, 9, and 12 as key contributors in resisting posterior tibial displacement.

### Postural orientation in subjects with anterior cruciate ligament injury: Development and first evaluation of a new observational test battery [^112cv6QF]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2010). Low credibility.

Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is associated with mechanical instability and defective neuromuscular function, and can lead to further injury, increased joint loading, and osteoarthritis. Patients with ACL injury demonstrate altered postural orientation, manifested as observable "substitution patterns" (SPs); however, no one has applied a clinically useful method to systematically study postural orientation in these patients. We investigated the presence of such patterns in 24 adults with ACL injury and in 49 controls, alongside the development and initial evaluation of a new test battery for SPs.

The rationale behind the test for SPs was to characterize postural orientation as the ability to maintain appropriate relationships between body segments and the environment during weight-bearing movements. In this first study, patients displayed SPs more frequently and/or more clearly on both their injured and uninjured sides than did controls. Inter-rater and intra-rater reproducibility was good at a group level. Future studies of validity, responsiveness, and the inclusion of other subgroups of patients with ACL injury will need to determine if the test for SPs can be used in the diagnostics of defective neuromuscular function following knee injury. This includes planning and carrying out training and rehabilitation, and deciding the appropriate time to return to activity and sports after an ACL injury.

### Incomplete bicruciate knee injuries: Results of treatment with isolated anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction [^1168boEe]. Arthroscopy (2002). Low credibility.

To determine how the presence of a partial injury to the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) in conjunction with an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear affects the outcome of ACL reconstruction, a case series study was conducted.

Between 1990 and 1998, 18 patients with surgically documented complete ACL ruptures and partial PCL tears, referred to as "incomplete bicruciate knee injuries", were treated with arthroscopic ACL reconstruction and PCL observation. Fifteen patients (83%) were available for follow-up evaluation at a mean of 60 months postoperatively. Follow-up evaluation consisted of physical examination, standard radiographs, isokinetic muscle testing, KT instrumented laxity testing, stress radiographs for posterior and total anterior-posterior translation, and Lysholm, Tegner, and IKDC outcome scores.

Results at follow-up indicated that 11 patients had a negative Lachman test, while 4 exhibited a 1+ Lachman (3 to 5 mm translation). Instrumented arthrometer tests showed less than 3 mm of increased anterior translation versus the opposite knee on manual maximum testing at 30 degrees in 11 patients and 3 to 5 mm translation in the remaining 4 patients, with an average of 1.3 mm increased translation. Symptomatic posterior instability was present in only 1 patient, who sustained a repeat injury resulting in a complete PCL tear postoperatively. Final IKDC outcome scores were normal or near normal in 13 patients (87%) and abnormal in 2 (13%). The average Lysholm score was 93 at follow-up, with only 1 patient having a score lower than 80.

Overall, these findings elucidate the outcomes of ACL reconstruction in the context of partial PCL injuries.

### An isolated rupture of the posterior cruciate ligament results in reduced preoperative knee function in comparison with an anterior cruciate ligament injury [^112UG3N4]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2013). Low credibility.

To investigate differences in preoperative knee function (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, KOOS), the time period from injury to surgery, and associated injuries was the focus when comparing primary isolated posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions.

Isolated primary ACL and PCL reconstructions registered in the Norwegian National Knee Ligament Registry from 2004 through 2010 were included (n = 71 primary PCLs and 9,649 primary ACLs). Linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the preoperative KOOS subscale values.

The preoperative KOOS in the PCL group (n = 71) and ACL group (n = 9,649) was significantly different for the subscales symptoms (mean difference, -8.4; 95% CI: -12.8 to -4.0), pain (mean difference, -15.9; 95% CI: -20.3 to -11.4), activities of daily living (mean difference, -12.9; 95% CI: -17.4 to -8.4), sport and recreation (mean difference, -15.9; 95% CI: -22.6 to -9.3), and quality of life (mean difference, -7.9; 95% CI: -12.4 to -3.5). The primary isolated PCL-reconstructed knees had a median time from injury to surgery of 21 months compared to 8 months for ACL injuries. The ACL-injured knees had more associated injuries, including meniscus and full-thickness cartilage lesions, than the PCL-injured knees.

Surgically treated knees with an isolated rupture of the PCL exhibited worse knee function preoperatively compared with knees with an isolated ACL injury; in addition, the delay to surgery was longer. Meniscal lesions were found more frequently in ACL-injured knees.

### Changes in knee laxity and ligament force after sectioning the posteromedial bundle of the posterior cruciate ligament [^112PrmpJ]. Arthroscopy (2006). Low credibility.

Our purpose was to evaluate the role of the posteromedial (PM) bundle of the native posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) in restraining posterior tibial translation and the effects of sectioning of the PM bundle on PCL forces.

- **Methods**: The PCL's femoral origin was mechanically isolated using a cylindrical coring cutter. A cap of bone containing the ligament fibers was attached to a load cell that recorded resultant force in the ligament as the knee was passively extended from 120 degrees to 0 degrees, without and with simulated tibial loading conditions. Anteroposterior laxity was also measured after load cell installation. The PM bundle was cut at its femoral origin, and all tests were repeated.

- **Results**: Cutting the PM bundle produced small but statistically significant increases in mean laxity at 0 degrees (+1.06 mm) and 10 degrees (+0.83 mm) of flexion. Mean laxities at 30 degrees, 45 degrees, 70 degrees, and 90 degrees were unchanged. Forces in the remaining anterolateral bundle were not significantly different from those in the intact ligament for any mode of tibial loading, except for the valgus moment, where sectioning of the PM bundle significantly reduced the PCL force at 0 degrees and 5 degrees of flexion.

- **Conclusions**: The relatively small increases in mean laxity after cutting of the PM bundle show that it plays a minor role in restraining posterior tibial translation. The minor changes in ligament force profiles after cutting of the PM bundle indicate that the remaining anterolateral bundle fibers continued to be loaded in a near-normal fashion.

### Different injury patterns exist among patients undergoing operative treatment of isolated PCL, combined PCL/ACL, and isolated ACL injuries: A study from the Swedish National Knee Ligament Registry [^113q5zDe]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2022). High credibility.

Despite their rarity, with an estimated incidence of 1–6%, posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) tears are devastating knee injuries that negatively impact subsequent knee function. During the 2010s, numerous studies from national knee ligament registries have offered valuable insights into the injury patterns and clinical outcomes of operatively treated PCL injuries. The PCL's larger cross-sectional area and superior tensile strength compared to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) make it more resistant to tears, resulting in PCL tears predominantly occurring during high-intensity sports and traffic-related traumas. Contrary to the traditional view that PCL tears mainly result from traffic accidents, the majority of operatively treated PCL injuries are induced by sports activities.

A non-operative approach is generally favored for the initial treatment of PCL tears; however, isolated PCL tears account for 38% of operatively treated PCL injuries in Scandinavia. Although isolated PCL reconstruction (PCL-R) has shown comparable improvements in subjective outcomes to isolated ACL reconstruction (ACL-R), patients undergoing PCL-R report inferior preoperative knee function. While these findings underline the detrimental effect of PCL tears on knee joints, the exact factors contributing to inferior knee function and return to sport rates in this patient population remain unclear. Intra-articular pathology and concomitant knee ligament injuries are frequent findings with a well-established negative impact.

### Evolving evidence in the treatment of primary and recurrent posterior cruciate ligament injuries, part 2: surgical techniques, outcomes and rehabilitation [^113YsMeR]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

Owing to the anatomy of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and the complex nature of PCL injuries, there is no consensus for a specific operative technique when considering posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (PCL-R). Many biomechanical and clinical research efforts have enabled the development of techniques focusing on anatomic restoration of native knee kinematics.

Variations between the different reconstructive techniques depend primarily on tunnel placement, graft choice, graft positioning and fixation, and the choice of an arthroscopic or open surgical approach. While studies have reported that both single-bundle (SB) and double-bundle (DB) PCL-R improve knee kinematics, biomechanical results have recently shown DB PCL-R to more closely approximate the native state of the ligament.

Assessing intraoperative ligament balance in the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL)-retaining total knee arthroplasty (TKA) can be achieved by quantifying tibio-femoral contact forces. Ligament balancing may involve selectively releasing PCL fibers; however, the effects of the extent and location of PCL release on compartmental contact forces are not well understood. To investigate these effects, we developed a computational model to quantify changes in medial and lateral contact forces resulting from targeted PCL fiber release.

- **Methods**: Computational models of 10 cadaver knees (five men and five women with a mean age of 63 years) were virtually implanted with a cruciate-retaining TKA. Passive knee flexion was simulated under three PCL conditions: all PCL fibers retained, all PCL fibers resected, and only the central PCL fibers released. Tibio-femoral contact forces in the medial and lateral compartments at 90° of flexion were measured for each PCL condition.

- **Results**: Resecting the PCL resulted in a reduction of contact forces by a median of 24.2 N (P ≤ 0.01) medially and a median of 11.1 N (P ≤ 0.01) laterally. Selective release of only the central PCL fibers reduced medial and lateral contact forces by medians of 11.5 N (P ≤ 0.05) and 4.5 N (P ≤ 0.05), representing 47% and 50% of the reduction observed with complete PCL resection, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Resecting the PCL asymmetrically impacts compartmental contact forces, with a greater reduction observed in the medial compartment.

### Specific fibre areas in the femoral footprint of the posterior cruciate ligament act as a major contributor in resisting posterior tibial displacement: A biomechanical robotic investigation [^111EXheK]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Low credibility.

The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is typically described as a two-bundle structure, consisting of the anterolateral bundle (ALB) and the posteromedial bundle (PMB). The ALB is more active in early flexion, while the PMB becomes more active in deep flexion. However, no clear dominance of a bundle is evident at different flexion angles, and insufficiency of both bundles must be present to result in clinically perceivable posterior instability.

To restore physiological biomechanical functions in a PCL-deficient knee, reconstructing the PCL with a graft mimicking the native restraint is favorable. This approach helps prevent osteoarthritis and preserves sporting activity. However, the optimal femoral and tibial tunnel positions for PCL reconstruction (PCLR) remain subject to debate. Due to the large surface area of the femoral footprint, different tunnel positions are possible, including single-bundle ALB and PMB reconstructions, isometric reconstructions, and double-bundle reconstructions, utilizing a wide array of possible surgical techniques.

For the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), specific fiber areas of the femoral and tibial footprint have been biomechanically shown to be the primary contributors in restraining anterior tibial translation (ATT), thereby guiding clinicians on femoral tunnel positioning. Similarly, the femoral footprint of the PCL comprises discernible fiber areas, which might demonstrate different contributions in restraining posterior tibial translation (PTT).

The purpose of this study was to investigate the different contributions of specific fiber areas within the femoral footprint of the PCL, aiding in the understanding of optimal surgical techniques for PCLR.

### Clinical outcomes after anterior cruciate ligament injury: Panther symposium ACL injury clinical outcomes consensus group [^114xSwHP]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Low credibility.

Clinical assessment of ACL injury treatment should include measures of anteroposterior and rotatory knee laxity.

The evaluation of knee joint laxity is a cornerstone for assessing the outcome of ACL treatment. Quantitative measures of knee joint laxity increase the reliability and validity of these assessments. The anatomic properties of the ACL make it a primary passive restraint to both anteroposterior (AP) and rotatory forces of the knee joint. As such, a valid assessment of knee joint laxity is key in evaluating the outcome of surgical treatment after ACL injury. This assessment should ideally occur at multiple follow-up points to detect any changes over time.

Failure to eliminate knee joint laxity with ACL reconstruction may indicate treatment failure. In contrast, patients undergoing non-operative treatment should be assessed for excessive laxity or the propagation of knee joint laxity. The latter scenario might signal a need for subsequent operative treatment, though it is important to distinguish between laxity and instability. Knee joint laxity is defined as the passive response of the knee joint when an external force or torque is applied, while instability is the patient's perception of symptoms during functional movement, independent of laxity.

Thus, knee joint laxity can be reliably measured and reported, making it the preferred metric for clinical outcome assessment. To minimize risk of bias, assessors should be blinded whenever possible, and all participating assessors should be trained in using a standardized execution technique for the laxity test.

### Anterolateral knee biomechanics [^112pG3wL]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Although changes in internal rotational laxity are examined and may be diagnostic for specific ligament injuries during a clinical evaluation of the knee, the resulting data do not indicate how much of the applied load (internal rotation torque in the case of testing for anterolateral rotational instability - ALRI) is resisted by each anatomical structure. To determine which structures are the primary restraints, a different test must be employed, where the changes in load are measured when a constant tibial displacement test is repeated after cutting a structure.

The method of sequential cutting of anatomical structures was introduced by the work of Butler et al, which led to the identification of the cruciate ligaments as the primary restraints to tibial anterior and posterior translation. They held the femur and tibia in a materials testing machine, displaced the tibia a known distance, and recorded the required force. They repeated the anterior translation after cutting the ACL, and the reduction in force represented what was previously resisted by the ACL. However, that method held the bones rigidly, preventing secondary movements. In particular, the release of tibial internal rotation allowed 30% more anterior translation. Consequently, test rigs with many sliding and rotating bearings were developed to allow multiple degrees of freedom of motion when the tibia was displaced, leading to detailed data on the roles of the ligaments, such as those for the PCL bundles. The problem then was that the repetition of the drawer force could not be continued.

### Augmentation or reconstruction of PCL? A quantitative review [^113qjDsx]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2013). Low credibility.

The purpose of this quantitative review is to document the effectiveness and complications of posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) surgery and compare the outcomes, advantages, and disadvantages of reconstructive and augmentation procedures.

A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Medline, Ovid, Google Scholar, and Embase databases using the combined keywords "PCL reconstruction", "PCL augmentation", "clinical outcomes", and "functional outcomes" with no limit for the year of publication. Articles were included if they reported data on clinical, functional, and imaging outcomes for patients who had undergone reconstruction or augmentation of the PCL for management of PCL injuries. Two authors screened the selected articles for title, abstract, and full text in accordance with predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The methodological quality of all articles was assessed by two authors according to the Coleman methodology score. The critical appraisal was made using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale.

A total of 34 studies, including 22 retrospective, 9 prospective, and 5 randomized control trials, were included by full text. The modified Coleman methodology score averaged 70.8 (SD 6.5), with a median of 73 (range from 60 to 82). At IKDC assessment, the average rate of normal (A) and nearly normal (B) outcomes was 89.8% (SD 4.2) (from 85 to 93%; median 91.4) after PCL augmentation and 80.1% (SD 12.4) after PCL reconstruction (from 57.2 to 100%; median 81.8%) were rated as normal (A) and nearly normal (B). The average Lysholm knee scores after PCL augmentation were not provided fully in the original text.

### Biomechanical properties of femoral posterior cruciate ligament fixations [^113ouxRe]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2014). Low credibility.

The success of reconstructions of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) primarily depends on the fixation strength at the tendon-bone interface. However, reliable data regarding the mechanical characteristics of PCL fixation techniques are limited. This study aimed to investigate the biomechanical properties of various femoral PCL fixation techniques.

Fresh human cadaver quadriceps and hamstring tendons were harvested and fixed into porcine femora using different methods: a press-fit fixation by suturing the tendon over a bone bridge (group A), a novel implant post-fixation (group B), and an interference screw fixation (group C). Each group comprised 10 specimens. The constructs underwent cyclic stretching and were subsequently loaded until failure. The evaluation focused on elongation during cyclic loading, stiffness, failure mode, and maximum failure load.

Elongation during cyclical loading was significantly greater between the 1st and 20th cycle than between the 20th and 500th cycle in all groups (p < 0.05). The maximum failure loads were: 409 ± 71 N (range 336–517 N) in group QA, 456 ± 58 N (range 347–510 N) in group QB, 548 ± 116 N (range 400–798 N) in group QC, 472 ± 114 N (range 316–676 N) in group HA, 494 ± 98 N (range 371–668 N) in group HB, and 498 ± 87 N (range 391–687 N) in group HC. Notably, the failure load was significantly higher for group QB compared to group QA (p < 0.05).

This study marks the first investigation into the biomechanical properties of femoral PCL fixations. It demonstrates that implant-free fixation techniques, such as press-fit or post-fixations, can withstand biomechanical forces comparable to those of interference screw fixation. The novel fixations demonstrate promising results in biomechanical resilience.

### The PCL index is correlated with the control of rotational kinematics that is achieved after anatomic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction [^117WinM8]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) index quantifies the curvature of the PCL seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that is caused by a change in tibiofemoral alignment in the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)-deficient knee. It has been proposed that the PCL index may be useful in assessing the success of ACL reconstruction (ACLR). The purpose of this study was to test if the PCL index is predictive of in vivo rotational kinematics and joint laxity measures in knees of patients after single-bundle ACLR. The hypothesis was that the PCL index is predictive of rotational knee kinematics and objective laxity scores.

- **Study design**: Controlled laboratory study.

- **Methods**: At a mean of 18.1 months postoperatively, the PCL index was defined on MRI in 16 patients prospectively followed up after anatomic single-bundle ACLR and in 16 matched controls. The patients were evaluated with 3-dimensional motion analysis during (1) descending and pivoting as well as (2) landing and pivoting tasks. The side-to-side difference in tibial rotation range of motion between the reconstructed knee and the contralateral intact knee was calculated. The side-to-side difference in anterior tibial translation was measured with a KT-1000 arthrometer. Linear regression models were used with the PCL index as a predictor of the side-to-side difference in tibial rotation for each task and the side-to-side difference in anterior tibial translation.

- **Results**: The PCL index of the reconstructed knees was significantly lower compared with that of the control knees (P < .001).

### Balancing the posterior cruciate ligament during cruciate-retaining fixed and mobile-bearing total knee arthroplasty: Description of the pull-out lift-off and slide-back tests [^113thVnD]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2008). Low credibility.

Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) preservation is a technically demanding procedure, but one that has been associated with excellent long-term results. It is crucial during this procedure that the PCL be placed under appropriate tension so that the kinetic benefits of its retention can be gained and the adverse effects of it being excessively tight or lax can be avoided. We describe two simple intraoperative tests that assess PCL tension in fixed- and mobile-bearing TKA.

- **The pull-out lift-off (POLO) test**: This is performed in fixed bearing knees and ensures appropriate PCL tension by confirming that it is neither too loose nor too tight.

- **The slide-back test**: This is applicable for rotating platform knees, providing an analogous evaluation for achieving proper PCL tension.

The authors have previously described the POLO test; however, this publication is no longer in print and, therefore, is not accessible as a reference. We deemed it appropriate to describe it again alongside the analogous test for rotating platform TKAs.

### Evolving evidence in the treatment of primary and recurrent posterior cruciate ligament injuries, part 2: Surgical techniques, outcomes and rehabilitation [^115PuCRb]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

Indications for PCL-R

Operative treatment of posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries is indicated for patients with symptomatic grade III (complete) tears displaying inadequate functional improvement in response to non-operative treatment. Furthermore, patients with PCL injuries with high-grade knee laxity or those combined with intraarticular or capsuloligamentous injuries should be considered for operative treatment. A side-to-side difference in posterior tibial translation (PTT) greater than 8 mm, revealed by stress radiography, indicates a complete PCL tear and presents an indication for operative treatment for symptomatic patients.

Additionally, the patient's demands are essential in treatment decision-making, leading to the recommendation of PCL-R in an athletic population. There is currently insufficient evidence in the literature to support a definitive treatment protocol; however, the historical preference towards non-operative treatment of isolated PCL injuries has recently shifted in favor of operative treatment. Indications for operative treatment may be based on increased translational and rotational tibial movement compared to contralateral PCL-intact knees, as measured on in vivo kinematic analyses. An increasing number of intra-articular injuries (e.g. meniscus, cartilage), pathological changes of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), and increased joint contact pressure (tibiofemoral and patellofemoral) have been observed in PCL-deficient patients.

A failure rate of 1–25% after primary PCL-R is reported, increasing to 45% if unfavorable patient-reported outcomes are noted.

### Tibial tunnel placement in posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A systematic review [^112SY4LM]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Reconstruction of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) yields less satisfying results than anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with respect to laxity control. Accurate tibial tunnel placement is crucial for successful PCL reconstruction using arthroscopic tibial tunnel techniques. A discrepancy between anatomical studies of the tibial PCL insertion site and surgical recommendations for tibial tunnel placement remains. The objective of this study was to identify the optimal placement of the tibial tunnel in PCL reconstruction based on clinical studies.

In a systematic review of the literature, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Review, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were screened for articles about PCL reconstruction from January 1990 to September 2011. Clinical trials comparing at least two PCL reconstruction techniques were extracted and independently analysed by each author. Only studies comparing different tibial tunnel placements in the retrospinal area were included.

This systematic review found no comparative clinical trial for tibial tunnel placement in PCL reconstruction. Several anatomical, radiological, and biomechanical studies have described the tibial insertion sites of the native PCL and have led to recommendations for placement of the tibial tunnel outlet in the retrospinal area. However, surgical recommendations and the results of morphological studies are often contradictory.

Reliable anatomical landmarks for tunnel placement are lacking. Future randomized controlled trials could compare precisely defined tibial tunnel placements to establish better surgical guidelines.

### Primary stability of three posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction procedures: A biomechanical in vitro study [^114uDFXa]. Arthroscopy (2005). Low credibility.

Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reconstruction procedures have not been thoroughly evaluated under cyclic loading conditions. We tested the hypothesis that PCL reconstruction with a quadrupled flexor-tendon graft and fixation using tapes and staples is biomechanically superior to that fixed with sutures, a button, and a post-screw, and is comparable to reconstruction with a bone–patellar tendon–bone (BPTB) graft.

- **Study design**: In vitro biomechanical study.

- **Methods**: A total of 45 porcine knees were used. The quadrupled flexor-tendon graft was fixed using the suture/button/post-screw procedure in 15 knees, and with the tape/staples procedure in another 15 knees. The remaining 15 knees underwent reconstruction with a BPTB graft secured with screws, serving as the standard control. In each group of 15 knees, 5 underwent tensile testing without cyclic loading, and 10 underwent the same tensile test after 5,000 cycles of load-controlled or displacement-controlled loading.

- **Results**: Each type of cyclic loading produced larger biomechanical changes in the knees fixed with the suture/button/post-screw procedure than in the knees secured using the other two procedures.

- **Conclusions**: In PCL reconstruction, the tape/staples procedure is biomechanically superior to the suture/button/post-screw procedure and is comparable to the BPTB/screws procedure with regard to the ultimate failure load. Neither of the procedures using the quadrupled flexor-tendon graft was comparable to the BPTB graft in linear stiffness and the initial displacement after load-controlled cyclic testing.

### The effect of posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction on patellofemoral contact pressures in the knee joint under simulated muscle loads [^113BokMD]. American Journal of Sports Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The mechanism of cartilage degeneration in the patellofemoral joint (PFJ) and medial compartment of the knee following posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury remains unclear. PCL reconstruction has been recommended to restore kinematics and prevent long-term degeneration. However, the effect of reconstruction techniques on PFJ contact pressures is unknown.

- **Purpose**: To measure PFJ contact pressures after PCL deficiency and reconstruction.

- **Method**: Eight cadaveric knees were tested with the PCL intact, deficient, and reconstructed. Contact pressures were measured at 30 degrees, 60 degrees, 90 degrees, and 120 degrees of flexion under simulated muscle loads. Knee kinematics were measured by a robotic testing system, and the PFJ contact pressures were measured using a thin film transducer. A single bundle Achilles tendon allograft was used in the reconstruction.

- **Results**: PCL deficiency significantly increased the peak contact pressures measured in the PFJ relative to the intact knee under both an isolated quadriceps load of 400 N and a combined quadriceps/hamstrings load of 400 N/200 N. Reconstruction did not significantly reduce the increased contact pressures observed in the PCL-deficient knee.

- **Conclusion**: The elevated contact pressures observed in the PCL-deficient knee and reconstructed knee might contribute to the long-term degeneration observed in both the non-operatively treated and PCL-reconstructed knees.

### Physical examination tests for the diagnosis of posterior cruciate ligament rupture: A systematic review [^114QSXJg]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

A systematic literature review was conducted to summarize and evaluate research on the accuracy of physical examination tests for diagnosing posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) tears. Rupture of the PCL is a severe knee injury that can lead to delayed rehabilitation, instability, or chronic knee pathologies. To our knowledge, there is currently no systematic review of studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of clinical examination tests to assess the integrity of the PCL.

A comprehensive systematic literature search was performed in MEDLINE from 1946, Embase from 1974, and the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database from 1985 until April 30, 2012. Studies were considered eligible if they compared the results of physical examination tests performed in the context of a PCL physical examination to those of a reference standard (arthroscopy, arthrotomy, magnetic resonance imaging). Methodological quality assessment was performed by two independent reviewers using the revised version of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool.

The search strategy revealed 1,307 articles, of which 11 met the inclusion criteria for this review. In these studies, 11 different physical examination tests were identified. Due to differences in study types, patient populations, and methodological quality, a meta-analysis was not indicated. Presently, most physical examination tests have not been evaluated sufficiently to be confident in their ability to either confirm or rule out a PCL tear.
