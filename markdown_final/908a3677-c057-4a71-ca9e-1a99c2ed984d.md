## Question

Management and treatment of patient with acute heart failure. EF 25%, fluid over load, age 84. Is she a candidate for gdmt?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether an 84-year-old woman with acute decompensated heart failure and an ejection fraction of 25% is a candidate for guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), and how to approach initiation and titration in this context. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and phenotype, including whether this is HFrEF and whether there are any reversible precipitants. Then, I should verify hemodynamic stability and congestion status to decide if GDMT can be started now or needs to wait. Next, I will review the four foundational GDMT classes and their evidence base, including any age-specific considerations. After that, I need to outline a practical, stepwise initiation and titration plan with safety monitoring. Finally, I should consider special issues in older adults, discharge planning, and follow-up, and then synthesize a clear recommendation with caveats and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical phenotype and stage. An LVEF of 25% meets the definition of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and acute decompensation with fluid overload places her in Stage C, which is exactly where GDMT is indicated unless contraindicated, so the answer is yes in principle, assuming we can safely initiate therapy now [^8a20c5cd] [^22b4bca3].

> Wait, let me verify hemodynamic stability before jumping to GDMT. I need to check blood pressure, heart rate, organ perfusion, and the severity of congestion. If she is hypotensive, in shock, or has evidence of low forward flow, I should prioritize stabilization and inotropes rather than starting neurohormonal blockade, whereas if she is normotensive or mildly hypotensive but perfusing well, GDMT can proceed with caution and close monitoring [^ed01d7b9] [^300d5aa7].

> I will now examine the four foundational GDMT classes and their evidence. The 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA guideline endorses ARNI (or ACEi/ARB if ARNI is not suitable), a beta-blocker, an MRA, and an SGLT2 inhibitor as the core pillars for HFrEF, with robust mortality and hospitalization benefits when used together and titrated to target doses, and this applies regardless of diabetes status for SGLT2 inhibitors [^22b4bca3] [^ff7c3977]. Hold on, I should verify whether age changes this. The guideline and contemporary expert consensus affirm that age alone is not a contraindication, and older adults still benefit from GDMT, albeit sometimes at lower achieved doses with careful monitoring [^2a1c7b7b] [^05c35795].

> Next, I should review initiation strategy in the setting of acute decompensation. The 2024 ACC expert consensus recommends initiating GDMT as early as feasible after hemodynamic stabilization, and even starting SGLT2 inhibitors during hospitalization when the patient is being decongested, given favorable safety and early outcome signals. STRONG-HF demonstrated that rapid up-titration with close follow-up is safe and reduces 180-day death or HF readmission, including in older adults, though benefits may be attenuated in the very elderly and require vigilance for hypotension and renal changes [^383a2c00] [^ea4c659f] [^c4ce7be1]. Let me reconsider the timing: if she is still very congested, I should prioritize diuresis first, then layer in GDMT once she is euvolemic and hemodynamically stable to minimize hypotension and renal injury risk [^ed01d7b9].

> I need to ensure a safe sequencing and titration plan. A practical approach is to start low and go slow: begin with low doses of ARNI (or ACEi/ARB), a beta-blocker, an MRA, and an SGLT2 inhibitor, then titrate every 1–2 weeks as tolerated to target doses used in trials, recognizing that many older adults will not reach full target doses and that the highest tolerated dose is acceptable. I should double-check for contraindications such as severe hyperkalemia, significant renal dysfunction, or prior angioedema before choosing ARNI, and monitor potassium and creatinine closely after each up-titration [^59c0ca0c] [^22b4bca3] [^2a1c7b7b]. But wait, what if her blood pressure is borderline low? In that case, I should favor starting with SGLT2 inhibitor and MRA first, then add ARNI/ACEi/ARB and beta-blocker once blood pressure improves with decongestion, to reduce hypotension risk [^notfound].

> Let me think about special considerations in an 84-year-old. Older adults have higher risks of hypotension, renal dysfunction, hyperkalemia, and falls, so I should start at the lowest effective doses, uptitrate more gradually, and consider deprescribing or dose reduction if adverse effects emerge. I should confirm that the patient and caregivers understand the regimen and can adhere, and I should screen for polypharmacy and drug interactions that could worsen tolerability [^2a1c7b7b] [^05c35795]. Hold on, I should verify that the benefit still holds despite lower doses. Yes, even partial dosing confers benefit, and the incremental gains from adding all four classes are substantial, so I should persist unless there is true intolerance [^59c0ca0c] [^22b4bca3].

> Next, I should review discharge planning and follow-up. I need to ensure she leaves the hospital with a written diuretic plan, clear GDMT schedule with dose targets, and early follow-up within 7–14 days to reassess congestion, renal function, electrolytes, and blood pressure, with a plan to continue uptitration. STRONG-HF and CONNECT-HF reinforce that early, protocolized follow-up improves GDMT optimization and outcomes, and that discharge on GDMT predicts continued use and titration at 12 months [^c4ce7be1] [^5b407547]. I should confirm that a multidisciplinary approach is in place to support adherence, education, and rapid response to changes in status [^0b0e90c1].

> I should double-check for reversible precipitants and comorbidities that could delay or modify therapy. Common triggers include infection, ischemia, arrhythmias, medication nonadherence, and uncontrolled hypertension; addressing these can improve stability and tolerance of GDMT. Additionally, I need to screen for anemia, thyroid disease, and valvular disease, as these can worsen HF and influence medication choices and sequencing [^ed01d7b9] [^300d5aa7].

> Let me synthesize the answer clearly. Yes, this 84-year-old with acute decompensated HFrEF and EF 25% is a candidate for GDMT, provided she is hemodynamically stabilized and euvolemia is being achieved. I should initiate the four foundational classes as soon as feasible, starting low and titrating carefully, with heightened vigilance for hypotension, renal function, and electrolytes, and with a plan for close early follow-up. If she remains unstable or in shock, I should stabilize first and defer neurohormonal blockade until perfusion improves, but I should not abandon GDMT solely due to age [^22b4bca3] [^383a2c00] [^2a1c7b7b].

This 84-year-old with acute heart failure and EF 25% is a **candidate for GDMT** once hemodynamically stable and euvolemic [^ed01d7b9]. GDMT should be **initiated during hospitalization** [^f1140c55] or soon after discharge, with careful monitoring for hypotension, renal dysfunction, and hyperkalemia [^ea4c659f]. Start low and titrate slowly, prioritizing SGLT2 inhibitor and ARNI/ACEi/ARB, then add beta-blocker and MRA as tolerated [^2b61453d]. If instability occurs, adjust dosing or sequencing, but avoid stopping GDMT unless absolutely necessary [^adb1462f]. Early, individualized GDMT can reduce mortality and readmissions even in older adults [^c4ce7be1] [^6dc91fe8].

## Indications for GDMT in elderly patients with acute heart failure

Current guidelines support GDMT for HFrEF regardless of age, provided there are **no absolute contraindications** [^2a1c7b7b]. In older adults, GDMT reduces mortality, hospitalizations, and improves quality of life, though careful monitoring is essential [^c4ce7be1] [^f92a3957].

---

## Recommended GDMT components and dosing considerations

The four foundational classes for HFrEF are:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Key considerations in elderly patients** |
|-|-|-|
| Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors | - ARNI (sacubitril/valsartan) <br/> - ACE inhibitors (lisinopril, enalapril) <br/> - ARBs (losartan, valsartan) | - Start low <br/> - Titrate slowly <br/> - Monitor for hypotension and renal dysfunction [^2a1c7b7b] |
| Beta-blockers | - Metoprolol succinate <br/> - Carvedilol <br/> - Bisoprolol | - Start low <br/> - Titrate slowly <br/> - Monitor for bradycardia and fatigue [^2a1c7b7b] |
| Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists | - Spironolactone <br/> - Eplerenone | - Monitor for hyperkalemia and renal dysfunction [^2a1c7b7b] |
| Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors | - Dapagliflozin <br/> - Empagliflozin | - Favorable safety profile <br/> - Can be initiated during hospitalization [^e1b4cf9b] |

---

## Timing and sequencing of GDMT initiation

GDMT should be **initiated during hospitalization** or soon after discharge once the patient is hemodynamically stable and euvolemic [^f1140c55]. Sequencing should be individualized: start with SGLT2 inhibitor and ARNI/ACEi/ARB, then add beta-blocker and MRA as tolerated [^2b61453d]. Rapid up-titration with close follow-up is supported by STRONG-HF, which showed reduced 180-day death or HF readmission [^c4ce7be1].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment of GDMT in elderly patients

Frequent monitoring is essential in older adults:

- **Blood pressure**: Monitor for hypotension, especially with ARNI/ACEi/ARB and beta-blockers [^e7a29e48].
- **Renal function**: Monitor creatinine and eGFR; adjust dosing if significant decline occurs [^adb1462f].
- **Electrolytes**: Monitor potassium, particularly with MRAs [^aea8a71e].
- **Symptoms**: Assess for dizziness, fatigue, and falls [^2a1c7b7b].

---

## Potential benefits and risks of GDMT in elderly patients

Benefits include reduced mortality, fewer hospitalizations, and improved quality of life, even in older adults [^c4ce7be1] [^f92a3957]. Risks include hypotension, renal dysfunction, hyperkalemia, and polypharmacy; these can be mitigated by careful dosing, monitoring, and patient education [^2a1c7b7b].

---

## Alternative therapies and adjunctive treatments

If GDMT is not tolerated, consider:

- **Ivabradine**: For persistent elevated heart rate despite beta-blocker [^e5595e49].
- **Vericiguat**: For worsening HFrEF despite GDMT [^83d78618].
- **Palliative care**: For advanced HF or poor tolerance of therapy [^22b4bca3].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

This patient is a **candidate for GDMT** once stabilized. Initiate during hospitalization or soon after discharge, start low, titrate slowly, and monitor closely for adverse effects. Early, individualized GDMT can improve outcomes even in older adults [^c4ce7be1].

Assessment of patients hospitalized with acute decompensated HF — In patients hospitalized with HF, severity of congestion and adequacy of perfusion should be assessed to guide triage and initial therapy, and the common precipitating factors and the overall patient trajectory should be assessed to guide appropriate therapy. For patients admitted with HF, treatment should address reversible factors, establish optimal volume status, and advance guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) toward targets for outpatient therapy. Initial triage includes clinical assessment of the hemodynamic profile for severity of congestion and adequacy of perfusion.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — diagnostic and therapeutic challenges include that there is "no single test that definitively establishes the diagnosis", so clinicians "must consider" potential mimics that may present with "signs of congestion and/or symptoms of dyspnea, exercise intolerance, or congestion with preserved EF". Even after diagnosis, "therapeutic challenges remain", and clinicians must consider comorbidities, nonpharmacological options, and guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) "to improve quality of life, reduce HF as well as non-HF hospitalizations, and improve survival". Delivery of care "requires multidisciplinary collaboration", and the document's purpose is to provide "practical and streamlined pathways for diagnosis and management, incorporating the emerging data from clinical trials".

Hospital initiation and titration of ARNI and guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT): Initiation of ARNI during an acute decompensated heart failure hospitalization is feasible after hemodynamic stabilization; in PIONEER-HF, up to 25% of patients developed hypotension when treated with sacubitril/valsartan, and ensuring that patients are not volume-depleted at initiation may help avoid this. TRANSITION demonstrated that about one-half of patients could achieve the target dose within 10 weeks after in-hospital initiation or soon after discharge, and following discharge, ongoing efforts toward GDMT optimization (including titration to target doses whenever possible) should continue. STRONG HF showed that intensive and rapid initiation and titration of GDMT with in-person follow-up after hospitalization was safe and tolerated and resulted in a reduction in 180-day HF hospitalizations and/or CV deaths.

### Optimization of guideline-directed medical therapy during hospitalization for heart Failure: mind the gap! [^b4342109]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Contemporary management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) consists of 4 foundational pillars of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) that have demonstrated incremental benefits in morbidity and mortality for patients with HFrEF. However, despite the high-quality evidence to support their use, rates of GDMT utilization remain dishearteningly low, and when GDMT is prescribed, it frequently occurs at subtarget doses. Hospitalization for decompensated heart failure is a pivotal moment in a patient's clinical trajectory that, for some, signifies the incident heart failure diagnosis and for others indicates a risk-enhancing event. Aggressive implementation of GDMT during a heart failure hospitalization, when the patient can be closely monitored while being decongested, is safe and significantly reduces subsequent morbidity and mortality. Despite the opportunity, GDMT optimization during a hospitalization for decompensated heart failure has been underutilized.

### 2023 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^3306af7d]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Approach to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) emphasizes that clinicians should perform testing, as guided by history and physical examination, to exclude cardiac and noncardiac heart failure (HF) mimics and identify comorbidities in individuals with dyspnea and/or edema and preserved EF, and should implement an HFpEF treatment plan with specific attention to management of comorbidities, nonpharmacological management, and guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT). Because many individuals with HFpEF do not present initially to cardiovascular specialists, multidisciplinary collaboration comprises essential components of care, including: primary care clinicians recognizing HFpEF as a potential diagnosis in persons with dyspnea, exertional intolerance, and edema, initiating diagnostic testing and appropriate GDMT, and recognizing when a cardiology referral is warranted; cardiology specialists (cardiologists and cardiology advanced practice professionals) who may also assess for alternative diagnoses explaining dyspnea, edema, and preserved EF and optimize GDMT; heart failure specialists who pursue advanced testing in case of diagnostic dilemma, manage special or unusual cardiomyopathies, identify clinical trial eligibility, and assess need and eligibility for advanced therapies including heart transplantation; and collaboration that may include electrophysiologists, interventional cardiologists or cardiac surgeons, endocrinologists, nephrologists, and pulmonologists.

Maintenance or optimization of GDMT during hospitalization — recommendations: In hospitalized patients with HFrEF, preexisting guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) should be continued and optimized unless contraindicated; mild decreases in renal function or asymptomatic reductions in blood pressure during HF hospitalization are not reasons to routinely discontinue diuresis or other GDMT; GDMT should be initiated during hospitalization after clinical stability is achieved; and if GDMT must be stopped during hospitalization, it should be reinitiated and further optimized as soon as possible.

Heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) — evidence scope and evaluation: There are no prospective RCTs for patients specifically with HFmrEF (LVEF, 41%–49%). Thus, it may be reasonable to treat these patients with GDMT used for treatment of HFrEF. Patients with HFmrEF should have repeat evaluation of LVEF to determine the trajectory of their disease process.

Given the current state of affairs, most practitioners who claim that patients are receiving 'guideline‐directed medical therapy' are making a judgment that is not based on objective criteria. 8 No set of standards has been developed to define 'optimal medical therapy'. Anyone who asserts that their patients are being managed appropriately is providing a well‐intentioned (but personal) opinion, since no one has defined what combination of treatments should be considered 'optimal', 'acceptable', 'adequate', 'reasonable' or 'guideline‐directed'.

Older adults with HFrEF — GDMT use and dosing: The page notes the evidence gap because "The upper range for inclusion in HF clinical trials has typically been age 75 ± 5 years; in essence, there are very few randomized data for drugs or devices in patients older than 80 years of age". Nonetheless, "the 4 classes of Class I therapies have generally consistent efficacy in older individuals", and "target doses for GDMT should be attempted in older patients, with close surveillance for any adverse drug reactions". It cautions that "Optimal doses for older patients may be lower than those studied in trials or tolerated in younger patients", that "'deprescribing', or the process of medication withdrawal or dose reduction to correct or prevent medication-related complications, may be an appropriate action", and that "financial toxicity related to cost of GDMT may be a particular issue for elderly individuals".

### Great debate: in patients with decompensated heart failure, acetazolamide in addition to loop diuretics is the first choice [^0f15d299]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Medical therapy for heart failure (HF) has made substantial progress during recent years, and the 'fantastic four' drugs angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors, beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA), and sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) markedly improve prognosis in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Early initiation of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) is key in patients diagnosed with HF as most drugs have been shown to reduce hard clinical endpoints such as cardiovascular death and HF hospitalization as early as some weeks after randomization.STRONG-HF has proved that an intensified treatment strategy of rapid up-titration of GDMT and close follow-up compared with usual care after an acute heart failure (AHF) admission reduced symptoms, improved quality of life, and decreased the risk of all-cause death or HF readmission after 6 months.

In sharp contrast to the myriad of randomized trials constituting the evidence base for GDMT in HFrEF, until recently, there has been virtually no randomized study investigating the most important medical therapy for all patients with acute decompensated or chronic HF with congestion, i.e. diuretics. While placebo-controlled larger studies with diuretics in HF are absent, the Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation (DOSE) study in 2011 found no difference between bolus dosages of furosemide vs. continuous infusion but a non-significant trend towards greater symptomatic improvement in the high-dose group. In clinical practice, adequate treatment of congestion and volume overload is key for symptom improvement in all patients with decompensated HF; frequent challenges include the assessment of diuretic response/resistance especially in the early phase and the best approach towards stepped pharmacologic diuretic strategies by combining additional diuretics with furosemide. Two-month treatment with tolvaptan initiated for acute treatment of patients hospitalized with HF had no effect on its primary endpoint of long-term mortality or HF-related morbidity in 4133 patients included in the EVEREST trial. It did show a significantly greater decrease in weight on Day 1. However, while statistically significant, the percentage of patients with at least a two-grade improvement in oedema at 7 days was 73.8% vs. 70.5%, leading to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 30.3. Furthermore, tolvaptan is an aquaretic agent that induces more water loss in contrast to other diuretic agents, which also induce natriuresis.

### Clinical management and therapeutic optimization of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and low blood pressure. A clinical consensus statement of the heart failure association (HFA) of the ESC [^e7a29e48]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite major advancements in heart failure (HF) management and guideline recommendations over the past two decades, real-world evidence highlights suboptimal implementation of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Low blood pressure (BP) is common in HFrEF patients and represents a major perceived barrier to implementing life-saving treatments in clinical practice, as physicians are often concerned about symptomatic hypotension and its consequences. Although low BP can be seen in those hospitalized with signs of shock, the most common scenario involves non-severe, asymptomatic hypotension in patients receiving foundational therapy for HFrEF, where premature down-titration or discontinuation of GDMT should be avoided. This clinical consensus statement provides a comprehensive overview of low BP in HFrEF, including its definition, risk factors, and effects of HF therapies on BP. We propose management pathways to optimize HFrEF treatment in the context of low BP, ultimately aiming to improve patient outcomes.

### An Indian expert consensus on patient-profile-based implementation of guideline-directed medical therapy in the management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: APPROACH-HF [^ecd474aa]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is a significant contributor to the impaired quality of life, hospitalizations and mortality globally as well as in India. Early and rapid initiation of the "4 pillars" of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) has been shown to significantly improve both morbidity and mortality associated with HFrEF. However, despite robust clinical evidence and proven benefits GDMT is significantly underutilized in clinical practice. Lack of simplified yet patient profile tailored treatment protocols, concerns regarding safety or tolerability of medications, and therapeutic inertia commonly contribute to underutilization. An Indian expert consensus was developed using the modified Delphi technique to address the GDMT underutilization. This expert consensus provides the guidance on use of GDMT based on the patient profiles encountered commonly in clinical practice with an objective of aiding the optimal GDMT utilization and thereby improving the clinical outcomes in patients with HFrEF.

The care of patients with chronic heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction should be determined by the evidence from large‐scale randomized controlled trials that form the basis of accepted standards of practice. Numerous guideline documents have issued recommendations to clinicians. 1, 2 These describe the treatments that should be prescribed (class I); those that are appropriate but are not mandated (class II); and those that should not be used (class III). However, guidelines typically do not describe what constitutes an acceptable standard of care. As a result of this uncertainty, practitioners who adhere to only one or two recommendations could contend that they are treating patients with heart failure 'in accordance with the guidelines'.

### Mortality and guideline-directed medical therapy in real-world heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction [^a6517301]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

6 CLINICAL PERSPECTIVES

6.1 Competencies in medical knowledge

The failure to treat patients eligible for GDMT with the full extent of pharmacologic therapy in routine clinical practice contributes to the high mortality rate of HF, an increasingly prevalent condition. Patient nonadherence, medication intolerance, and contraindications compound this problem. Improved attention to state‐of‐the‐art care, together with broadening treatment options, would help reduce preventable deaths and improve quality of life for cardiovascular patients.

6.2 Translational outlook

Investigating causes behind patient nonadherence is an important avenue for future research, and the development of more nonpharmacologic treatment options may aid in the treatment of patients who are intolerant of or unresponsive to traditional GDMT.

### GDMT for heart failure and the clinician's conundrum [^e750efcb]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Therapeutic advances in management of CHF have decreased mortality and have impacted progression in patients with mild to moderate heart failure. Aggressive campaigns by cardiology societies aimed at increasing implementation of these measures in routine practices have almost generalized the treatment of heart failure irrespective of individual variations of clinical status of patients and stages of heart failure. This explains why morbidity compression and quality of life improvement have not been realized fully particularly in patients with advanced disease. To examine whether GDMT for CHF is backed by unambiguous evidence of clinical efficacy for its global implementation in every patient at all stages of the syndrome. ACC/AHA, ESC Guidelines for CHF, and their updates were reviewed. Clinical trial cited in the guideline documents and other pertaining published literatures were analyzed. FINDINGS: Many of the recommended GDMT for CHF lack unequivocal evidence of clinical efficacy in patients with diverge etiology of heart failure and concomitant comorbid conditions Some of the recommendations which are useful in early stages, lack evidence of efficacy in more advanced stages of heart failure. Application of results of research trials in patients beyond their inclusion and exclusion criteria, appears mere extrapolation, Clinicians are faced with the conundrum of implementing the recommendations without indubitable evidence of their efficacy in every patient of their practice. CONCLUSION: A reappraisal of Guidelines is needed to address outstanding questions pertaining to the efficacy of recommendations and plug the knowledge gaps without assumption and extrapolation of results of RCTs beyond their inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Heart failure (HF) affects over 60 million individuals globally. Contemporary guideline-directed medical therapies (GDMT) reduce cardiovascular mortality and HF hospitalizations. However, medication non-adherence represents a critical barrier limiting real-world efficacy of GDMT. This scientific statement aims to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding, measuring, and addressing medication non-adherence in HF management across diverse healthcare settings. Addressing medication non-adherence requires systematic, multifaceted approaches targeting individual patient barriers while implementing system-level interventions. Polypills, digital monitoring platforms, enhanced patient education and empowerment, and multidisciplinary care models represent promising strategies to optimize therapeutic adherence and improve clinical outcomes in HF management.

### Use of evidence-based therapy in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction across age strata [^b3a54497]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) enrol selected populations, and this may compromise generalizability and limit the implementation of their findings into clinical practice. Most RCTs in heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) do not explicitly exclude older patients, but these are often poorly represented, though HF is highly prevalent and incident in older populations. Age per se is not a contraindication to guideline‐directed medical therapy (GDMT), but lower use of GDMT has frequently been observed in older patients. Potential explanations might be perceived contraindications and reduced tolerance, patient preferences, or clinical inertia. Moreover, the limited evidence supporting the incremental prognostic effect of GDMT target dose (TD) achievement in older patients might lead clinicians to a more cautious approach to uptitration. Finally, among older patients, the current GDMT implementation status in octogenarians is even more rarely investigated since this population was underrepresented in previous registry‐based studies focused on the use of therapies.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive overview on the current implementation status of HF evidence‐based therapy and explore reasons for underuse/underdosing in a large and unselected national cohort of HFrEF patients across different age strata and within specific subgroups of interest.

Care coordination in HFrEF — patients with HFrEF frequently require consultative care delivered by electrophysiology specialists to implant, monitor, and adjust devices such as ICDs or CRT devices, and comorbidities are particularly common in the elderly, with more than 50% of patients with HF on Medicare having 4 or more non-CV comorbidities and more than 25% having 6 or more. As new medications and devices become available that require optimal communication between multiple parties, including the patient, care coordination is especially important; possible approaches include a "consultative" approach or a "team" approach, and all approaches to HFrEF management need to be patient-centered, use shared decision-making, and involve communication across disciplines. Randomized trials have demonstrated the superiority of the team-based approach over usual care in patients with HFrEF with respect to the risks of death, hospitalization, lengths of stay, and quality of life, and these outcomes are generally attributed to greater adherence to GDMT, higher proportions of patients receiving effective medication doses, and earlier recognition of HF signs and symptoms.

### 2023 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^ff8cab66]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — scope and diagnostic definition are outlined, noting that heart failure (HF) carries a lifetime risk at age 40 of approximately 20%, and that HFpEF continues to rise and now accounts for more than 50% of HF cases with outcomes comparable to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), while often under-recognized with substantial resource utilization. Per the Universal Definition of HF, diagnosis requires symptoms and/or signs of HF caused by structural/functional cardiac abnormalities and at least 1 of the following: elevated natriuretic peptides or objective evidence of cardiogenic pulmonary or systemic congestion. HFpEF is defined as a clinical diagnosis of HF with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50%, whereas EFs between 40% and 50% are noted as HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF). The document also notes that HFpEF is not synonymous with diastolic dysfunction and lists pivotal issues to address in HFpEF care, including how to approach a person with shortness of breath, overcome diagnostic dilemmas and identify a need for further testing, rule out mimics to avoid missed diagnosis, manage comorbidities and care complexities, initiate and optimize GDMTs, determine when and why to refer to a cardiologist or HF specialist, improve access to care, and recognize sex-specific differences in diagnosis and care management.

The 2013 (with updates in 2016 and 2017) American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and 2016 European Society of Cardiology guidelines provide practical evidence-based clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of both acute and chronic heart failure (HF). Both guidelines address noninvasive and invasive testing to establish the diagnosis of HF with reduced ejection fraction and HF with preserved ejection fraction. Extensive trial evidence supports the use of guideline-directed medical therapy and device-based therapies for the optimal management of patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction. Specific recommendations are also provided for HF with preserved ejection fraction although the evidence is substantially weaker. Management of medical comorbidities is now addressed in both guidelines. Acute HF and end-stage disease requiring advanced therapies are also discussed. This review compares specific recommendations across the spectrum of HF phenotypes and disease severity, highlights areas where differences exist, and lists consequential studies published since the latest guidelines.

Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) initiation strategy and phenotype considerations indicate that a combination of 4 classes can be started at the same time at low doses with more than one titration at a time, while sequencing may be necessary in other cases; the Writing Committee affirms directly initiating ARNI whenever possible to avoid delays; initiation and titration may require considering patient phenotype, with ARNI often better tolerated when the patient is still congested ("wet") and beta-blockers better tolerated when the patient is less congested ("dry") with an adequate resting heart rate; beta-blockers should not be newly initiated in decompensated signs or symptoms but can be continued in decompensated HF, and only evidence-based beta-blockers should be used in HFrEF.

Table 1
Mortality and Readmission Rates for AHF: A Global Perspective

The combined findings of these registries demonstrate that, despite many differences in patients' characteristics, age, background disease, and treatment, morbidity and mortality rates after an AHF admission are high and are similar across the globe. Mortality within 90 days of an AHF event is consistently ≈10% to 15%, and readmission rates are 20% to 30% and higher, in the United States, in Europe, and across Asia, Africa, and South America. AHF is therefore a malignant disease affecting the whole planet. In places where registries and data are available longitudinally, it seems that these severe adverse outcomes have not decreased over the past decades, and may have even increased, especially in the United States.

Treatment of

Despite these staggering numbers and associated costs, until recently no therapies had been shown to improve these dire outcomes. Because of this lack of effective therapy, of the 90 pages of the 2022 Heart Failure Clinical Practice Guidelines, only 3 were dedicated to AHF, despite the fact that most adverse outcomes in patients with HF occur during or immediately after an AHF event. These guidelines recommend that patients with AHF are diuresed with loop diuretics intravenously and then orally with careful monitoring of symptoms and signs of HF, fluid balance, and weight (level of evidence 1b). In those who are nonresponsive, an intensified diuretic regimen, including either more loop diuretics or a second‐line diuretic, may be considered (level of evidence 2b). Intravenous vasodilators may be used to relieve congestion in selected patients, especially those without hypotension (level of evidence 2b). Additional treatments may be considered in patients in shock or at risk of shock. Furthermore, it is recommended that guideline‐directed medical therapy (GDMT) should be continued or started in those with lower ejection fraction. In addition, some workup to assess the presence of possible precipitating factors should be undertaken (previously described). When such workup identifies potential precipitants, those should be addressed as much as possible. In some cases, the therapeutic implications are straightforward, such as is the case of an acute myocardial infraction, infections, such as a pneumonia, or pulmonary embolism. In other cases, evidence is lacking to help the physician decide on the best therapeutic approach, as is the case with some valvular lessions.

Figure 7B — titration of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) outlines trajectory-based inpatient actions: Patients with decompensated HFrEF "should be diuresed and started on SGLT inhibitor unless contraindicated or cost prohibitive", while those "with an improving trajectory… should have optimization of GDMT". For a new diagnosis, "initiation of all 4 pillars of GDMT should be attempted", and for chronic HF on partial therapy, care "should have personalized therapy to fill in gaps, considering a switch from an ACE inhibitor/ARB to ARNI if appropriate". In chronic Class IV HF with decompensation, "caution is required…; these patients may not tolerate even low doses of beta blockers and RAS, although an attempt at titration may be made". If the short-term course is "stalled or worsening", patients "should have re-evaluation of comorbidities and consideration of other diagnoses". Long-term course "should be reevaluated, with consideration of goals of care, candidacy for advanced therapies, and experimental treatments". The "ideal goal is initiation of all 4 pillars of GDMT… in the hospital on a baseline of diuretic therapy", with "a plan for ongoing addition and titration of GDMT after discharge", including a "Loop diuretic plan on discharge". The figure lists the GDMT pillars as "SGLT inhibitors ARNI or ACEI/ARB beta-blockers MRA".

### Safety, tolerability and efficacy of up-titration of guideline-directed medical therapies for acute heart failure in elderly patients: a sub-analysis of the STRONG-HF randomized clinical trial [^c4ce7be1]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

STRONG-HF examined a high-intensity care (HIC) strategy of rapid up-titration of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) and close follow-up after acute heart failure (AHF) admission. We assess the role of age on efficacy and safety of HIC.

Methods and Results

Hospitalized AHF patients, not treated with optimal GDMT were randomized to HIC or usual care. The primary endpoint of 180-day death or HF readmission occurred equally in older (> 65years, n = 493, 74 ± 5years) and younger patients (53 ± 11years, adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.73–1.43, p = 0.89). Older patients received slightly lower GDMT to day 21, but same doses at day 90 and 180. The effect of HIC on the primary endpoint was numerically higher in younger (aHR 0.51, 95% CI 0.32–0.82) than older patients (aHR 0.73, 95% CI 0.46–1.15, adjusted interaction p = 0.30), partially related to COVID-19 deaths. After exclusion of COVID-19 deaths, the effect of HIC was similar in younger (aHR 0.51, 95% CI 0.32–0.82) and older patients (aHR 0.63, 95% CI 0.32–1.02, adjusted interaction p = 0.56), with no treatment-by-age interaction (interaction p = 0.57). HIC induced larger improvements in quality of life to day 90 in younger (EQ-VAS adjusted-mean difference 5.51, 95% CI 3.20–7.82) than in older patients (1.77, 95% CI -0.75 to 4.29, interaction p = 0.032). HIC was associated with similar rates of adverse events in older and younger patients.

Conclusion

High-intensity care after AHF was safe and resulted in a significant reduction of all-cause death or HF readmission at 180days across the study age spectrum. Older patients have smaller benefits in terms of quality of life.

Concomitant guideline-directed medical therapy

Figure 4 illustrates the medication management of patients based on LVEF phenotype (≤ 40% or > 40%). Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) was optimized early from the time of randomization. At randomization, the rates of GDMT were 84% for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEi/ARB) or angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), 77% for beta-blockers, 68% for mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), 52% for sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) in patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, and 32% with quadruple GDMT. By 7 days, these rates improved to 85%, 89%, 75%, 70%, and 47%, respectively, indicating an optimized GDMT. The rates of SGLT2i in patients with LVEF > 40% were 50% at randomization and 60% at 7 days. The median daily dose of oral furosemide was 60 mg/day (IQR: 40, 80) at 7 days, decreasing to 40 mg/day (IQR: 20, 80) at 8 weeks. No differences were observed between colchicine and placebo groups (see Supplementary material).

Definitions — guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HF with LV systolic dysfunction: GDMT requires individualization but ideally should include the combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, a beta-blocker, mineralocorticoid antagonist (MRA), and a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i), with therapy adjusted to target doses as tolerated. Sacubitril/valsartan is indicated for patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II to IV HF, ivabradine should be considered in patients in sinus rhythm who remain with elevated heart rates (> 70 beats/min) after maximally tolerated beta-blocker dose, diuretics are adjusted as needed to control fluid retention, and in selected patients the addition of aldosterone antagonists and hydralazine plus nitrate combinations should be considered. Patients who are going to receive substantial benefit from medical treatment alone usually show some clinical improvement during the first 3 to 6 months, medical therapy is also assumed to include adequate rate control for tachyarrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, and it is recommended that GDMT be provided for ≥ 3 months before planned reassessment of LV function to consider device implantation; if LV function improves to the point where primary prevention indications no longer apply, then device implantation is not indicated.

### Initiation, continuation, switching, and withdrawal of heart failure medical therapies during Hospitalization [^48934bdc]. JACC: Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients with worsening heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) spend a large proportion of time in the hospital and other health care facilities. The benefits of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) in the outpatient setting have been shown in large randomized controlled trials. However, the decision to initiate, continue, switch, or withdraw HFrEF medications in the inpatient setting is often based on multiple factors and subject to significant variability across providers. Based on available data, in well-selected, treatment-naïve patients who are hemodynamically stable and clinically euvolemic after stabilization during hospitalization for HF, elements of GDMT can be safely initiated. Inpatient continuation of GDMT for HFrEF appears safe and well-tolerated in most hemodynamically stable patients. Hospitalization is also a potential time for switching from an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker to sacubitril/valsartan therapy in eligible patients, and is the subject of ongoing study. Therapy withdrawal or need for dose reduction is rarely required, but if needed identifies a particularly at-risk group of patients with progressive HF. If recurrent intolerance to neurohormonal blockers is observed, these patients should be evaluated for advanced HF therapies. There is an enduring need for using the teachable moment of HFrEF hospitalization for optimal initiation, continuation, and switching of GDMT to improve post-discharge patient outcomes and the quality of chronic HFrEF care.

Universal definition of heart failure — patient and clinician perspective explains that relying solely on symptoms can be confusing because symptoms are nonspecific and subjective, and that patients may become asymptomatic (NYHA functional class I) while structural, cellular, and molecular abnormalities continue to worsen. Although Stage C HF uses the phrase "current or previous symptoms", patients may interpret lack of signs and symptoms as being out of HF and be less likely to adhere to care, and health care professionals may be less likely to optimize guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) when symptoms are mild or absent.

### OPTImal PHARMacological therapy for patients with heart failure: rationale and design of the OPTIPHARM-HF registry [^caae4934]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

Patients with heart failure (HF) remain often undertreated for multiple reasons, including treatment inertia, contraindications, and intolerance. The OPTIimal PHARMacological therapy for patients with Heart Failure (OPTIPHARM-HF) registry is designed to evaluate the prevalence of evidence-based medical treatment prescription and titration, as well as the causes of its underuse, in a broad real-world population of consecutive patients with HF across the whole ejection fraction spectrum and among different clinical phenotypes.

Methods

The OPTIPHARM-HF registry (NCT06192524) is a prospective, multicenter, observational, national study of adult patients with symptomatic HF, as defined by current international guidelines, regardless of ejection fraction. Both outpatients and inpatients with chronic and acute decompensated HF will be recruited. The study will enroll up to 2500 patients with chronic HF at approximately 35 Italian HF centres. Patients will be followed for a maximum duration of 24months. The primary objective of the OPTIPHARM-HF registry is to assess prescription and adherence to evidence-based guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) in patients with HF. The primary outcome is to describe the prevalence of GDMT use according to target guideline recommendation. Secondary objectives include implementation of comorbidity treatment, evaluation of sequence of treatment introduction and up-titration, description of GDMT implementation in the specific HF population, main causes of GDMT underuse, and assessment of cumulative rate of cardiovascular events.

Conclusion

The OPTIPHARM-HF registry will provide important implications for improving patient care and adoption of recommended medical therapy into clinical practice among HF patients.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) — hypertension management prioritizes guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) and modest BP goals. HFrEF is "defined as left ventricular ejection fraction < 40%". In HFrEF with hypertension, "uptitration of HF GDMT to the maximally tolerated dose is recommended for hypertension control", and although "the optimal BP goal is unknown; however, a goal SBP < 130 mm Hg should at least be attained in patients with hypertension and HFrEF". For congestion, "Diuretics should be added as needed for volume overload". If BP remains elevated despite GDMT, "Dihydropyridine CCB may be used", whereas "Nondihydropyridine CCB may be harmful in patients with HFrEF… and are not recommended for hypertension management".

### Universal definition and classification of heart failure: a report of the Heart Failure Society of America, heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology, Japanese heart failure society and writing committee of the universal definition of heart failure [^8a20c5cd]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

In this document, we propose a universal definition of heart failure (HF) as the following: HF is a clinical syndrome with symptoms and or signs caused by a structural and/or functional cardiac abnormality and corroborated by elevated natriuretic peptide levels and or objective evidence of pulmonary or systemic congestion. We propose revised stages of HF as follows. At-risk for HF (Stage A), for patients at risk for HF but without current or prior symptoms or signs of HF and without structural or biomarkers evidence of heart disease. Pre-HF (stage B), for patients without current or prior symptoms or signs of HF, but evidence of structural heart disease or abnormal cardiac function, or elevated natriuretic peptide levels. HF (Stage C), for patients with current or prior symptoms and/or signs of HF caused by a structural and/or functional cardiac abnormality. Advanced HF (Stage D), for patients with severe symptoms and/or signs of HF at rest, recurrent hospitalizations despite guideline-directed management and therapy (GDMT), refractory or intolerant to GDMT, requiring advanced therapies such as consideration for transplant, mechanical circulatory support, or palliative care. Finally, we propose a new and revised classification of HF according to left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The classification includes HF with reduced EF (HFrEF): HF with an LVEF of ≤ 40%; HF with mildly reduced EF (HFmrEF): HF with an LVEF of 41% to 49%; HF with preserved EF (HFpEF): HF with an LVEF of ≥ 50%; and HF with improved EF (HFimpEF): HF with a baseline LVEF of ≤ 40%, a ≥ 10-point increase from baseline LVEF, and a second measurement of LVEF of > 40%.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

ACC 2024 heart failure hospitalization focused update — executive summary highlights that heart failure (HF) affects nearly 6.7 million Americans and that patients admitted with HF have a 20% to 30% risk of death within 1 year, with goals of hospitalization including assessment and optimization of therapy to address the long-term trajectory after discharge. The update harmonizes with the 2022 ACC/AHA/HFSA HF Guideline and ECDP documents concerning optimization of therapy in chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and Figure 1 places increased emphasis on establishing all 4 pillars of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HFrEF in the hospital, when possible, along with ensuring appropriate follow-up to monitor tolerance and continue titration. The figure also now includes sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) inhibition; given the robust evidence for safety and efficacy of SGLT inhibitors, their use can be considered earlier than or concomitant with neurohormonal antagonists such as beta-blockers, angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs)/angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and mineralocorticoid antagonists (MRAs). For initiation strategies, patients may have a new HFrEF diagnosis, in which case initiation of all 4 pillars of GDMT should be attempted; patients with chronic HF on partial GDMT should receive personalized therapy to fill in gaps, considering a switch from an ACE inhibitor/ARB to ARNI, if appropriate, and caution is required for patients with chronic Class IV HF with decompensated HF, some of whom may not tolerate neurohormonal antagonists, even in low doses.

### Optimizing foundational therapies in patients with HFrEF: how Do we translate these findings into clinical care? [^f378516c]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Given the high risk of adverse outcomes in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), there is an urgent need for the initiation and titration of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) that can reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality. Clinical practice guidelines are now emphasizing the need for early and rapid initiation of therapies that have cardiovascular benefit. Recognizing that there are many barriers to GDMT initiation and optimization, health care providers should aim to introduce the 4 pillars of quadruple therapy now recommended by most clinical practice guidelines: angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors, beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors. A large proportion of patients with HFrEF do not have clinical contraindications to GDMT but are not treated with these therapies. Early initiation of low-dose combination therapy should be tolerated by most patients. However, patient-related factors such as hemodynamics, frailty, and laboratory values will need consideration for maximum tolerated GDMT. GDMT initiation in acute heart failure hospitalization represents another important avenue to improve use of GDMT. Finally, removal of therapies that do not have clear cardiovascular benefit should be considered to lower polypharmacy and reduce the risk of adverse side effects. Future prospective studies aimed at guiding optimal implementation of quadruple therapy are warranted to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with HFrEF.

### Mortality and guideline-directed medical therapy in real-world heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction [^ee64ff4d]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Heart failure (HF) is a growing epidemic that affects approximately 23 million people worldwide and 6.2 million in the United States. It is associated with high rates of hospitalization, and 5‐year mortality after diagnosis is as high as 75%. The type and management of HF is increasingly characterized by ejection fraction (EF). Patients with an EF of 40% or less, accompanied by structural abnormalities in the left ventricle, are said to have reduced EF. These cases make up about half of all HF patients. Clinical guidelines for the treatment of HFrEF have been tested extensively with strong improvements in condition and include one medication from at least two classes. Either an angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE‐I) or one of its alternatives, plus a beta blocker (BB) and in many cases, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, constitute guideline‐directed medical therapy (GDMT) and are recommended in HFrEF. These medications have been demonstrated to significantly improve prognosis, reduce HF hospitalizations, and decrease the risk of cardiovascular death. Unfortunately, the multidrug regimen of GDMT is more difficult to implement and optimize outside of the setting of controlled clinical trials. Many HFrEF patients are not maintained on GDMT, which is potentially caused by gaps in clinical implementation, drug tolerability, and/or patient comorbidities. In this analysis, we consider such patient‐level factors in characterizing the uptake of and effect of GDMT among real‐world HFrEF patients in the United States. The purpose of our study is to establish the impact of GDMT (and the lack thereof) on overall mortality. Our hypotheses were (1) a substantial portion of real‐world HFrEF patients are not receiving GDMT; (2) those patients not on GDMT will have reduced survival over 1–2 years.

Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) after hospitalization in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF): treatment gaps. Nearly half (46%) of patients with HFrEF have no changes made to oral GDMT in the 12 months after hospitalization despite many being discharged on suboptimal doses. From claims-based studies, 42% of patients with HFrEF are not prescribed any GDMT within 30 days post-index hospitalization, and 45% are prescribed either no oral GDMT or monotherapy within 1-year post-index hospitalization. From CHAMP-HF, initiation or dose increases of beta blockers, ACEi-ARB-ARNi, and MRA occur in ≤ 10% of patients with HFrEF within 1 year of hospitalization. Very few eligible patients with HFrEF receive target doses of beta blockers (18.7%), ACEi-ARB (10.8%), or ARNi (2.0%), and less than 10% of patients with HFrEF are on target doses of ACEi-ARB-ARNi, beta blockers, and MRA within 12 months of an index hospitalization.

### Optimal initial intravenous loop Diuretic Dosing in acute decompensated heart Failure [^9ad63e79]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Optimizing HF medical therapy from admission to discharge is critical in reducing morbidity and mortality associated with ADHF hospitalizations. Performance and quality benchmarks such as initiating GDMT before discharge and implementing thorough monitoring and follow-up postdischarge have been shown to reduce HF readmissions. While individual strategies for hospital diuretic management can reduce patient-reported congestion and improve urine output, they have not been shown to reduce hospital LOS, readmissions, or mortality. To enhance the quality of care for diuretic management in ADHF patients, a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach is required early in hospital management, akin to the early, goal-directed therapy bundles used in septic shock. The concept of early "door-to-diuretic" has shown promising outcomes, associating with reduced 30-day readmission and mortality. Therefore, a comprehensive approach should include the early administration of optimal initial IV diuretics, coupled with vigilant monitoring and diuretic adjustment based on patient response to both initial and subsequent dosing. The inclusion of key collaborators involved in the first 24 hours of admission is crucial to these time-sensitive efforts and includes first responders, the emergency department team, and any admitting teams (both cardiology and non-cardiology services). The recently concluded Efficacy of a Standardized Diuretic Protocol in Acute Heart Failure and Pragmatic Urinary Sodium-based Treatment Algorithm in Acute Heart Failure trials provide valuable insights into such strategies with standardized natriuresis-guided diuretic strategies in patients admitted for ADHF.

### Pragmatic trial of messaging to providers about treatment of acute heart failure: the PROMPT-AHF trial [^edc0a7cb]. American Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute Heart failure (AHF) is among the most frequent causes of hospitalization in the United States, contributing to substantial health care costs, morbidity, and mortality. Inpatient initiation of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) is recommended for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization. However, underutilization of GDMT prior to discharge is pervasive, representing a valuable missed opportunity to optimize evidence-based care. The PRagmatic Trial Of Messaging to Providers about Treatment of Acute Heart Failure tests the effectiveness of an electronic health record embedded clinical decision support system that informs providers during hospital management about indicated but not yet prescribed GDMT for eligible AHF patients with HFrEF. PRagmatic Trial Of Messaging to Providers about Treatment of Acute Heart Failureis an open-label, multicenter, pragmatic randomized controlled trial of 1,012 patients hospitalized with HFrEF. Eligible patients randomized to the intervention group are exposed to a tailored best practice advisory embedded within the electronic health record that alerts providers to prescribe omitted GDMT. The primary outcome is an increase in the proportion of additional GDMT medication classes prescribed at the time of discharge compared to those in the usual care arm.

### Titration of medications after acute heart Failure is safe, tolerated, and effective regardless of risk [^c3275386]. JACC: Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) decisions may be less affected by single patient variables such as blood pressure or kidney function and more by overall risk profile. In STRONG-HF (Safety, tolerability and efficacy of up-titration of guideline-directed medical therapies for acute heart failure), high-intensity care (HIC) in the form of rapid uptitration of heart failure (HF) GDMT was effective overall, but the safety, tolerability and efficacy of HIC across the spectrum of HF severity is unknown. Evaluating this with a simple risk-based framework offers an alternative and more clinically translatable approach than traditional subgroup analyses.

Objectives

The authors sought to assess safety, tolerability, and efficacy of HIC according to the simple, powerful, and clinically translatable MAGGIC (Meta-Analysis Global Group in Chronic) HF risk score.

Methods

In STRONG-HF, 1,078 patients with acute HF were randomized to HIC (uptitration of treatments to 100% of recommended doses within 2 weeks of discharge and 4 scheduled outpatient visits over the 2 months after discharge) vs usual care (UC). The primary endpoint was the composite of all-cause death or first HF rehospitalization at day 180. Baseline HF risk profile was determined by the previously validated MAGGIC risk score. Treatment effect was stratified according to MAGGIC risk score both as a categorical and continuous variable.

Results

Among 1,062 patients (98.5%) with complete data for whom a MAGGIC score could be calculated at baseline, GDMT use at baseline was similar across MAGGIC tertiles. Overall GDMT prescriptions achieved for individual medication classes were higher in the HIC vs UC group and did not differ by MAGGIC risk score tertiles (interaction nonsignificant). The incidence of all-cause death or HF readmission at day 180 was, respectively, 16.3%, 18.9%, and 23.2% for MAGGIC risk score tertiles 1, 2, and 3. The HIC arm was at lower risk of all-cause death or HF readmission at day 180 (HR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.50–0.86) and this finding was robust across MAGGIC risk score modeled as a categorical (HR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.62–0.68 in tertiles 1, 2, and 3; interaction nonsignificant) for all comparisons and continuous (interaction nonsignificant) variable. The rate of adverse events was higher in the HIC group, but this observation did not differ based on MAGGIC risk score tertile (interaction nonsignificant).

Conclusions

HIC led to better use of GDMT and lower HF-related morbidity and mortality compared with UC, regardless of the underlying HF risk profile. (Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of Rapid Optimization, Helped by NT-proBNP testinG, of Heart Failure Therapies [STRONG-HF]; NCT03412201).

### Treatment of congestive heart failure… [^4dfa0bc3]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Early recognition and prevention therapies, combined with lifestyle modification, are essential in the treatment of heart failure. Therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, β-blockers, and diuretics is now standard. Digoxin is added to improve clinical symptoms, especially in patients with atrial fibrillation. Aldosterone antagonists may be recommended in select patients with stable New York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure. The practitioner should carefully titrate these medications to avoid excessive volume depletion but allow for some decreased renal function. 8, 52 Undertitration of primary diuretics can diminish the patient's response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and increase the frequency of adverse effects of treatment with β-blockers. 53, 54 Although ACE inhibitors and digoxin have weak diuretic properties, 53–56 only primary diuretics can control fluid overload adequately.

Loop diuretics should be used as first-line agents, with thiazides added for refractory fluid overload. Diuretic treatment should be combined with a low-salt diet, 8 a β-blocker, and an ACE inhibitor. 2, 3. The practitioner should begin with oral furosemide, 20 to 40 mg once daily. Dose titration goals are maintenance of adequate renal perfusion, avoidance of symptomatic hypotension, and achievement of stable weight. Hydrochlorothiazide, 25 mg, can be added with refractory fluid overload to escalating furosemide doses. Patients with NYHA classes II and III heart failure were randomized to enalapril maleate or a combination of hydralazine plus isosorbide dinitrate, with both regimens added to conventional therapy. At 2 years, enalapril reduced the risk for death 28% more than the combination vasodilator therapy.
60. Blockade of β-adrenergic receptors, previously contraindicated as a heart failure treatment, is now a pivotal treatment modality.

The patients studied in the trial had stable NYHA class III or IV heart failure, an ejection fraction of less than 0. 35, a serum creatinine level of less than 221 µmol/L, and a potassium level of less than
5. 0 mmol/L. 8 Patients were treated with an ACE inhibitor and a loop diuretic but were not allowed potassium-sparing diuretics.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy after hospitalization for acute heart failure: insights from the CONNECT-HF [^490085aa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

A significant gap remains in the initiation and uptitration of guideline‐directed medical therapy (GDMT) in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). This implementation gap exists despite strong clinical guideline recommendations to use GDMT to reduce morbidity and improve clinical outcomes, including mortality, for patients and families affected by HFrEF. A prior analysis of registry participants in the United States demonstrated that the use of GDMT for chronic HFrEF remained consistently low and unaltered between baseline and 12‐month follow‐up in a stable outpatient setting. However, there is a scarcity of data regarding patterns of medication changes and barriers to GDMT implementation for patients after hospitalization for decompensated HF, particular for patients with HF with a range of insurers. Importantly, the clinical benefits of GDMT become apparent within days to weeks after initiation. Considering that ≈25% of patients hospitalized for decompensated HF die or are readmitted within 30 days, HF hospitalizations may represent an important opportunity to initiate and titrate GDMT. Therefore, analyzing data that includes the hospitalization period is crucial to optimize postdischarge management.

The CONNECT‐HF (Care Optimization Through Patient and Hospital Engagement Clinical Trial for Heart Failure) trial was a large, pragmatic trial designed to assess the effect of a hospital and postdischarge quality improvement intervention, involving monthly audit and feedback reports on GDMT performance to hospitals, compared with usual care. The high‐intensity intervention did not improve the implementation of GDMT at discharge or over time. To gain further insights into the factors associated with GDMT implementation beyond the effect of the quality improvement intervention, our objective was to identify factors associated with implementing GDMT in patients with HFrEF.

### Contemporary guideline-directed medical therapy in de novo, chronic, and worsening heart failure patients: first data from the TITRATE-HF study [^7d3248e0]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

Despite clear guideline recommendations for initiating four drug classes in all patients with heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and the availability of rapid titration schemes, information on real-world implementation lags behind. Closely following the 2021 ESC HF guidelines and 2023 focused update, the TITRATE-HF study started to prospectively investigate the use, sequencing, and titration of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) in HF patients, including the identification of implementation barriers.

Methods and Results

TITRATE-HF is an ongoing long-term HF registry conducted in the Netherlands. Overall, 4288 patients from 48 hospitals were included. Among these patients, 1732 presented with de novo, 2240 with chronic, and 316 with worsening HF. The median age was 71years (interquartile range [IQR] 63–78), 29% were female, and median ejection fraction was 35% (IQR 25–40). In total, 44% of chronic and worsening HFrEF patients were prescribed quadruple therapy. However, only 1% of HFrEF patients achieved target dose for all drug classes. In addition, quadruple therapy was more often prescribed to patients treated in a dedicated HF outpatient clinic as compared to a general cardiology outpatient clinic. In each GDMT drug class, 19% to 36% of non-use in HFrEF patients was related to side-effects, intolerances, or contraindications. In the de novo HF cohort, 49% of patients already used one or more GDMT drug classes for other indications than HF.

Conclusion

This first analysis of the TITRATE-HF study reports relatively high use of GDMT in a contemporary HF cohort, while still showing room for improvement regarding quadruple therapy. Importantly, the use and dose of GDMT were suboptimal, with the reasons often remaining unclear. This underscores the urgency for further optimization of GDMT and implementation strategies within HF management.

### Rapid sequence initiation of device therapy in heart Failure [^a704b729]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

To achieve the full benefits of GDMT, they must first be prescribed by the clinicians, the patients should not have any absolute or relative contraindications, achieve tolerability to target doses, and finally adhere to them in the long run. There are multiple factors that adversely impact the use of long-term consistent drug therapy, including tolerability (eg, kidney function, blood pressure, heart rate, electrolyte imbalance, side effects) and adherence (eg, financial aspects, polypharmacy, lifestyle, and social considerations). Given these, it is no surprise that achieving GDMT in HF is challenging and may in part explain the overall suboptimal use of these drugs and even worse trends in achieve target doses of drugs among eligible patients. For example, in a cohort of ∼15,000 patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction, 70% had a record of medical therapies (a beta-blocker and either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor), and only 57% had concurrent medication fills, suggesting that 43% of patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction may not be on medical therapies, let alone optimal doses of these therapies. The conventional approach can overlook or delay patients who are not on GDMT (eg, due to nontolerance and/or nonadherence) from being evaluated for device-based therapies. It is important to note that the intolerant patients tend to be sicker with higher risk than the general HF population. Timely therapy, drugs and devices, has the potential to provide clinical and health status benefits in these patients and slow the disease progression. Conventional approaches can enormously delay appropriate device therapy to eligible patients as evaluation for these typically follow GDMT optimization. This is important as patients with HF have up to a 60% loss in life expectancy compared with general population.

### Optimization of evidence-based heart failure medications after an acute heart failure admission: a secondary analysis of the STRONG-HF randomized clinical trial [^d01652de]. JAMA Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, this post hoc secondary analysis from the STRONG-HF study demonstrated that higher achieved doses of HF GDMT medications were associated with better outcomes and greater improvement of quality of life, with the best results seen in patients treated with an average dose of 90% or more of maximally recommended doses. Therefore, when patients can tolerate higher doses of GDMT, all efforts should be made to rapidly uptitrate patients with AHF to optimal doses of the 3 and (likely) 4 pillars of HF medications, including RASis, BBs, MRAs and SGLT2is.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy after hospitalization for acute heart failure: insights from the CONNECT-HF [^5b407547]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In this secondary analysis of the CONNECT‐HF trial, we observed, that following hospital discharge, the rates of GDMT use and achievement of ≥ 50% of the target dose were low shortly after discharge and remained unchanged during the 12‐month follow‐up period. Most notably, use of GDMT at discharge was significantly associated with use and achievement of ≥ 50% of the target dose of GDMT at 12 months. These findings underscore the importance of initiating GDMT in patients with HFrEF at the time of HF hospitalization.

### Real-world analysis of guideline-based therapy after hospitalization for heart failure [^afc580c5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a disabling, progressive clinical syndrome characterized by inadequate ventricular filling or ejection of blood. 1 In the United States, > 650 000 people are diagnosed with HF annually, and incidence increases with age 2; estimated 5‐year mortality after diagnosis is ≈50%. 3, 4 Over 20% of patients have an HF‐related hospitalization in the year after diagnosis. 5, 6 Outcomes following HF‐related hospitalization are poor; within 30 days of hospital discharge, 25% of patients are readmitted, and 10% of patients die. 7, 8

Approximately half of patients with HF have a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), characterized by systolic dysfunction and defined clinically by a left‐ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%. 1 The American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association guidelines recommend that patients with HFrEF receive dual therapy with beta‐blockers (BBs) in combination with angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs) if patients tolerate ACEIs or ARBs. 1, 9, 10 In patients who remain symptomatic despite these therapies, the addition of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) is recommended as triple therapy. Diuretics are used for symptomatic management of fluid retention. Most patients with HFrEF (> 98%) are candidates for guideline‐directed medical therapy, having no absolute contraindications to treatment. 11 Despite the availability and efficacy of these therapies, suboptimal use in real‐world clinical practice remains high. 11, 12, 13 As intolerance accounts for only ≈5% to 20% of underutilization in treated patients, 14 the need for prudent initiation and uptitration of HF therapies persists.

Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2024). High credibility.

Heart failure with improved ejection fraction (HFimpEF) — outpatient continuation of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) quality measure defines the eligible population as patients age ≥ 18 y with prior HFrEF (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] ≤ 40%) and a subsequent LVEF > 40% who continue GDMT in the outpatient setting; the numerator is patients initially diagnosed with HFimpEF who continued to have GDMT prescribed during the measurement period, and the denominator is patients age ≥ 18 y medically managed in the outpatient setting with HFimpEF. Denominator exclusions are heart transplant and LVAD; exceptions include documented medical or patient reasons for not continuing GDMT. The measurement period is 12 mo, data sources include EHR and administrative claims, attribution is to the individual practitioner and medical practices, and the care setting is outpatient. Documentation notes include that therapy is to be continued at ≥ 1 visit in the 12-mo period and that "medically managed" includes ≥ 2 outpatient encounters. The rationale states that posttreatment improvement indicates remission and stopping HF medications is associated with relapse and reduced LVEF. The guideline recommendation states: "GDMT should be continued to prevent relapse of HF and LV dysfunction, even in patients who may become asymptomatic" (Class 1, Level of Evidence: B-R).

### Use of evidence-based therapy in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction across age strata [^d1a9fc02]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims

In older patients, guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (< 40%; HFrEF) is not contraindicated, but adherence to guidelines is limited. We investigated the implementation of GDMT in HFrEF across different age strata in a large nationwide cohort.

Methods and Results

Patients with HFrEF and HF duration ≥ 3months registered in the Swedish HF Registry between 2000–2018 were analysed according to age. Multivariable logistic and multinomial regressions were fitted to investigate factors associated with underuse/underdosing. Of 27430 patients, 31% were < 70years old, 34% 70-79years old, and 35% ≥ 80years old. Use of treatments progressively decreased with increasing age. Use of renin-angiotensin system/angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors, beta-blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists was 80%, 88% and 35% in age ≥ 80years; 90%, 93% and 47% in age 70-79years; and 95%, 95% and 54% in age < 70years, respectively. Among patients with an indication, use of implantable cardioverter defibrillator and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) was 7% and 23% in age ≥ 80years; 22% and 42% in age 70-79years; and 29% and 50% in age < 70years, respectively. Older patients were less likely treated with target doses or combinations of HF medications. Except for CRT, after extensive adjustments, age was inversely associated with the likelihood of GDMT use and target dose achievement.

Conclusion

In HFrEF, gaps persist in the use of medications and devices. In disagreement with current recommendations, older patients remain undertreated. Improving strategies and a more individualized approach for implementing use of GDMT in HFrEF are required, particularly in older patients.

ACC/AHA stages of heart failure (HF) — definitions and criteria: Stage A (At risk for HF) includes individuals at risk for HF but "without symptoms, structural heart disease, or cardiac biomarkers of stretch or injury", including those with "hypertension, atherosclerotic CVD, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and obesity, exposure to cardiotoxic agents, genetic variant for cardiomyopathy, or positive family history of cardiomyopathy". Stage B (Pre‑HF) requires "No symptoms or signs of HF and evidence of 1 of the following:" structural heart diseasea (e.g., "Reduced ejection fraction, reduced strain", "Ventricular hypertrophy", "Chamber enlargement", "Wall motion abnormalities", "Valvular heart disease"), "Evidence for increased filling pressuresa" ("By invasive hemodynamic measurements" or "By noninvasive imaging suggesting elevated filling pressures [eg, Doppler echocardiography]"), or biomarkers/risks ("Patients with risk factors and increased levels of BNPsb or Persistently elevated cardiac troponin in the absence of competing diagnoses"). Stage C (Symptomatic HF) is "Structural heart disease with current or previous symptoms of HF". Stage D (Advanced HF) is "Marked HF symptoms that interfere with daily life and with recurrent hospitalizations despite attempts to optimize GDMT" (guideline‑directed medical therapy).

Stage C HFrEF — digoxin pharmacological treatment: COR 2b; LOE B-R state, "In patients with symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) despite guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) (or who are unable to tolerate GDMT), digoxin might be considered to decrease hospitalizations for HF". Evidence cited notes only one large randomized trial predating current GDMT in NYHA class II to III patients, with 2 to 5 years of digoxin showing no effect on mortality but a modest reduction in the combined risk of death and hospitalization and no significant effect on health-related QOL; use "requires caution" and is reserved for those symptomatic despite optimization of GDMT. Dosing and safety notes include that digoxin is usually initiated at a low dose; GDMT is expected to be optimized before considering addition; higher serum digoxin concentrations are linked to higher death risk (≥ 1.2 ng/mL and ≥ 1.6 ng/mL); therapy may be continued in the absence of a contraindication or discontinued with caution; clinical worsening after withdrawal has been shown; and typical dosing is 0.125 to 0.25 mg daily, with low doses (0.125 mg daily or every other day) initially if the patient is > 70 years.

### Navigating between scylla and charybdis: challenges and strategies for implementing guideline-directed medical therapy in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^3cf273d5]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) has the potential to reduce the risks of mortality and hospitalisation in patients with heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). However, real-world data indicate that many patients with HFrEF do not receive optimised GDMT, which involves several different medications, many of which require up-titration to target doses. There are many challenges to implementing GDMT, the most important being patient-related factors (comorbidities, advanced age, frailty, cognitive impairment, poor adherence, low socioeconomic status), treatment-related factors (intolerance, side-effects) and healthcare-related factors that influence availability and accessibility of HF care. Accordingly, international disparities in resources for HF management and limited public reimbursement of GDMT, coupled with clinical inertia for treatment intensification combine to hinder efforts to provide GDMT. In this review paper, authors aim to provide solutions based on available evidence, practical experience, and expert consensus on how to utilise evolving strategies, novel medications, and patient profiling to allow the more comprehensive uptake of GDMT. Authors discuss professional education, motivation, and training, as well as patient empowerment for self-care as important tools to overcome clinical inertia and boost GDMT implementation. We provide evidence on how multidisciplinary care and institutional accreditation can be successfully used to increase prescription rates and adherence to GDMT. We consider the role of modern technologies in advancing professional and patient education and facilitating patient-provider communication. Finally, authors emphasise the role of novel drugs (especially sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors), and a tailored approach to drug management as evolving strategies for the more successful implementation of GDMT.

### HFSA 2010 comprehensive heart failure practice guideline [^8292e483]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome characterized by high mortality, frequent hospitalization, reduced quality of life, and a complex therapeutic regimen. Knowledge about HF is accumulating so rapidly that individual clinicians may be unable to readily and adequately synthesize new information into effective strategies of care for patients with this syndrome. Trial data, though valuable, often do not give direction for individual patient management. These characteristics make HF an ideal candidate for practice guidelines. The 2010 Heart Failure Society of America comprehensive practice guideline addresses the full range of evaluation, care, and management of patients with HF.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy after hospitalization for acute heart failure: insights from the CONNECT-HF [^065ab8a8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

We examined the factors associated with the use and titration to at least 50% of the target dose of GDMT using a data set originating from a HF hospitalization. Our analysis identified that GDMT use at hospital discharge is the strongest factor associated with use and titration to at least 50% of the target dose of GDMT at 12 months, outweighing the association of the quality improvement intervention itself. This finding underscores the critical need for initiating GDMT during hospitalization for patients with HFrEF. Notably, this result aligns with the findings of OPTIMIZE‐HF (Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients With Heart Failure), Get With The Guidelines‐HF, the STRONG‐HF (Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of Rapid Optimization, Helped by NT‐proBNP [N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide] Testing, of Heart Failure Therapies) trial, and the updated clinical practice guidelines, which emphasize an intensive strategy of initiation and uptitration of GDMT before discharge and early after discharge. It is essential for clinicians to acknowledge that a significant proportion of patients hospitalized for HF have a high risk of either death or rehospitalization within 30 days postdischarge. Given that the clinical benefits of quadruple therapy appear within days to weeks after initiation and incremental additive benefits of these medications, commencing these medications during the hospital stay can help overcome clinical inertia and potentially prevent avoidable deaths and readmissions among these high‐risk patients.

### Translating the 2021 ESC heart failure guideline recommendations in daily practice: results from a heart failure survey. A scientific statement of the ESC council for cardiology practice and the heart failure association of the ESC [^83b8b186]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Real-world data show that guidelines are insufficiently implemented, and particularly guideline-directed medical therapies (GDMT) are underused in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in clinical practice. The Council for Cardiology Practice and the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) developed a survey aiming to (i) evaluate the perspectives of the cardiology community on the 2021 ESC heart failure (HF) guidelines, (ii) pinpoint disparities in disease management, and (iii) propose strategies to enhance adherence to HF guidelines.

Methods and Results

A 22-question survey regarding the diagnosis and treatment of HFrEF was delivered between March and June 2022. Of 457 physicians, 54% were general cardiologists, 19.4% were HF specialists, 18.9% other cardiac specialists, and 7.7% non-cardiac specialists. For diagnosis, 52.1% employed echocardiography and natriuretic peptides (NPs), 33.2% primarily used echocardiography, and 14.7% predominantly relied on NPs. The first drug class initiated in HFrEF was angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ACEi/ARNi) (91.2%), beta-blockers (BB) (73.8%), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) (53.4%), and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (48.1%). The combination ACEi/ARNi + MRA+ BB was preferred by 39.3% of physicians, ACEi/ARNi + SGLT2 inhibitors + BB by 33.3%, and ACEi/ARNi + BB by 22.2%. The time required to initiate and optimize GDMT was estimated to be < 1month by 8.3%, 1-3months by 52%, 3-6months by 31.8%, and > 6months by 7.9%. Compared to general cardiologists, HF specialists/academic cardiologists reported lower estimated time-to-initiation, and more commonly preferred a parallel initiation of GDMT rather than a sequential approach.

Conclusion

Participants generally followed diagnostic and treatment guidelines, but variations in HFrEF management across care settings or HF specialties were noted. The survey may raise awareness and promote standardized HF care.

### Use of evidence-based therapy in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction across age strata [^d2f8c8a2]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims

In older patients, guideline‐directed medical therapy (GDMT) for heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (< 40%; HFrEF) is not contraindicated, but adherence to guidelines is limited. We investigated the implementation of GDMT in HFrEF across different age strata in a large nationwide cohort.

Methods and results

Patients with HFrEF and HF duration ≥ 3 months registered in the Swedish HF Registry between 2000–2018 were analysed according to age. Multivariable logistic and multinomial regressions were fitted to investigate factors associated with underuse/underdosing. Of 27 430 patients, 31% were < 70 years old, 34% 70–79 years old, and 35% ≥ 80 years old. Use of treatments progressively decreased with increasing age. Use of renin–angiotensin system/angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors, beta‐blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists was 80%, 88% and 35% in age ≥ 80 years; 90%, 93% and 47% in age 70–79 years; and 95%, 95% and 54% in age < 70 years, respectively. Among patients with an indication, use of implantable cardioverter defibrillator and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) was 7% and 23% in age ≥ 80 years; 22% and 42% in age 70–79 years; and 29% and 50% in age < 70 years, respectively. Older patients were less likely treated with target doses or combinations of HF medications. Except for CRT, after extensive adjustments, age was inversely associated with the likelihood of GDMT use and target dose achievement.

Conclusion

In HFrEF, gaps persist in the use of medications and devices. In disagreement with current recommendations, older patients remain undertreated. Improving strategies and a more individualized approach for implementing use of GDMT in HFrEF are required, particularly in older patients.

### Post-discharge prognosis of patients admitted to hospital for heart failure by world region, and national level of income and income disparity (REPORT-HF): a cohort study [^6dc91fe8]. The Lancet: Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Background

Heart failure is a global public health problem, affecting a large number of individuals from low-income and middle-income countries. REPORT-HF is, to our knowledge, the first prospective global registry collecting information on patient characteristics, management, and prognosis of acute heart failure using a single protocol. The aim of this study was to investigate differences in 1-year post-discharge mortality according to region, country income, and income inequality.

Methods

Patients were enrolled during hospitalisation for acute heart failure from 358 centres in 44 countries on six continents. We stratified countries according to a modified WHO regional classification (Latin America, North America, western Europe, eastern Europe, eastern Mediterranean and Africa, southeast Asia, and western Pacific), country income (low, middle, high) and income inequality (according to tertiles of Gini index). Risk factors were identified on the basis of expert opinion and knowledge of the literature.

Findings

Of 18102 patients discharged, 3461 (20%) died within 1 year. Important predictors of 1-year mortality were old age, anaemia, chronic kidney disease, presence of valvular heart disease, left ventricular ejection fraction phenotype (heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [HFrEF] vs preserved ejection fraction [HFpEF]), and being on guideline-directed medical treatment (GDMT) at discharge (p < 0·0001 for all). Patients from eastern Europe had the lowest 1-year mortality (16%) and patients from eastern Mediterranean and Africa (22%) and Latin America (22%) the highest. Patients from lower-income countries (ie, ≤ US$3955 per capita; hazard ratio 1·58, 95% CI 1·41–1·78), or with greater income inequality (ie, from the highest Gini tertile; 1·25, 1·13–1·38) had a higher 1-year mortality compared with patients from regions with higher income (ie, > $12235 per capita) or lower income inequality (ie, from the lowest Gini tertile). Compared with patients with HFrEF, patients with HFpEF had a lower 1-year mortality with little variation by income level (p interaction for HFrEF vs HFpEF < 0·0001).

Interpretation

Acute heart failure is associated with a high post-discharge mortality, particularly in patients with HFrEF from low-income regions with high income inequality. Regional differences exist in the proportion of eligible patients discharged on GDMT, which was strongly associated with mortality and might reflect lack of access to post-discharge care and prescribing of GDMT.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^22b4bca3]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

AHA/ACC/HFSA 2022 guideline — treatment of HFrEF stages C and D outlines a stepwise algorithm beginning with guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT): for HFrEF with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40% (Stage C), initiate ARNI in NYHA II–III (1), ACEI or ARB in NYHA I–IV (1), beta blocker (1), MRA (1), SGLT2i (1), and diuretics as needed (1); Step 1 medications "may be started simultaneously at initial (low) doses", or "may be started sequentially" "without need to achieve target dosing before initiating next medication", and doses "should be increased to target as tolerated". Patient scenarios guide additional therapy: NYHA III–IV in African American patients → hydral-nitrates (1); NYHA II–III; LVEF ≤ 35%; > 1 y survival → ICD (1); NYHA II–III, ambulatory IV; LVEF ≤ 35%; NSR and QRS ≥ 150 ms with LBBB → CRT-D (1). Reassessment follows to "Reassess symptoms, labs, health status, and LVEF"; if refractory HF (Stage D), proceed to referral for HF specialty care with options including, in select patients, durable MCS (1), cardiac transplant (1), palliative care (can be initiated before Stage D) (1), and investigational studies; continue GDMT with serial reassessment and optimize dosing, adherence and patient education, and address goals of care.

### Acute heart failure: current pharmacological treatment and perspectives [^828570d7]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute heart failure (AHF) represents the most frequent cause of unplanned hospital admission in patients older than 65 years. Symptoms and clinical signs of AHF (e.g. dyspnoea, orthopnoea, oedema, jugular vein distension, and variation of body weight) are mostly related to systemic venous congestion secondary to various mechanisms including extracellular fluids, increased ventricular filling pressures, and/or auto-transfusion of blood from the splanchnic into the pulmonary circulation. Thus, the initial management of AHF patients should be mostly based on decongestive therapies on admission followed, before discharge, by rapid implementation of guideline-directed oral medical therapies for heart failure. The therapeutic management of AHF requires the identification and rapid diagnosis of the disease, the diagnosis of the cause (or triggering factor), the evaluation of severity, the presence of comorbidities, and, finally, the initiation of a rapid treatment. The most recent guidelines from ESC and ACC/AHA/HFSA have provided updated recommendations on AHF management. Recommended pharmacological treatment for AHF includes diuretic therapy aiming to relieve congestion and achieve optimal fluid status, early and rapid initiation of oral therapies before discharge combined with a close follow-up. Non-pharmacological AHF management requires risk stratification in the emergency department and non-invasive ventilation in case of respiratory failure. Vasodilators should be considered as initial therapy in AHF precipitated by hypertension. On the background of recent large randomized clinical trials and international guidelines, this state-of-the-art review describes current pharmacological treatments and potential directions for future research in AHF.

### Factors associated with maintenance of an improved ejection fraction: an echocardiogram-based registry study [^140d1be0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Heart failure with improved ejection fraction (HFimpEF) has been increasingly recognized as a distinct clinical entity, with unique characteristics that differ from the long‐established syndromes of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. HFimpEF is currently defined by an initial clinical presentation of heart failure and an accompanying left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40%, with subsequent improved LVEF on follow‐up imaging. While these patients can now be identified with routine echocardiography, assessing and stratifying their likelihood for maintained LVEF > 40%, as well as their risk for future cardiac events, remains a challenge. While current guidelines support continuing patients with HFimpEF on the same guideline‐directed medical therapy (GDMT) recommended for all patients with HFrEF, evidence remains relatively limited as to which characteristics are key prognostic indicators in this heterogeneous group of patients.

A randomized trial aimed to assess the phased withdrawal of GDMT in patients with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy and improved ejection fraction (EF) demonstrated a higher rate of HFrEF relapse in patients that discontinue GDMT. These findings encouraged the revision of the terminology from heart failure with recovered EF to HFimpEF, since studies have demonstrated that the improved EF does not represent a true recovery of normal cardiac function. Factors associated with HFimpEF have been previously described. Evidence to date suggests that younger age, female sex, and the lack of history of ischemic heart disease have all been associated with initial improvement in EF. However, factors associated with maintenance of an improved LVEF remain largely unknown.

Using a large cohort of patients with HFrEF who demonstrated subsequent improvement in LVEF, we assessed the clinical characteristics and therapeutic interventions associated with maintaining an improved LVEF beyond 9 months after the initial improvement phase.

### Need for a unified decision-making tool for ultrafiltration therapy in heart failure; call for action [^b7d79d4a]. American Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Although ultrafiltration portends several theoretical advantages over the standard therapy for acute decompensated heart failure, it might not be the optimal treatment for all patients presenting with an episode of decompensation. It is not yet clear how to prospectively identify the subset of patients that would benefit from this therapeutic modality. Based on the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying acute decompensated heart failure, early ultrafiltration therapy can be an appropriate initial management strategy for those patients with diuretic resistance whose associated renal dysfunction is related to hemodynamic changes rather than a structural abnormality. In the absence of widely accepted consensus guidelines, ultrafiltration use is currently subject to considerable variations among physicians. A clinical tool (eg, a scoring system) that is based on the individual patient's characteristics is therefore needed to prospectively identify the appropriate candidates for this therapy. Using this system is likely to portend better outcomes while helping to avoid unnecessary exposure to potential risks of extracorporeal therapies.

### Early initiation of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in acute heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e1b4cf9b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We present here the largest meta‐analysis of RCTs assessing efficacy and safety of early initiation of SGLT2is in 2320 patients hospitalized for AHF, regardless of LVEF or diabetic status. Hence, we provide evidence that, in settings of AHF (1) early use of SGLT2is is associated with a reduction in all‐cause death and HF rehospitalizations, and (2) initiation before discharge showed an even greater improvement in survival. These results advocate for the possible initiation of SGLT2is as soon as possible in patients with AHF according to inclusion/exclusion criteria used in the studies.

While both recent American and European HF consensus, clearly reaffirmed the imperative need to implement a 4‐drug therapy (GDMT) as soon as possible (SGLT2i, β blockers, angiotensin‐converting‐enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist), numerous studies identified critical gaps in the speed of their introduction, highlighting widespread therapeutic inertia. A rapid uptitration of GDMT to the maximum tolerated dose is also a key point in both the American and European guidelines. Yet, failure to initiate GDMT at discharge from an HF hospitalization is associated with a substantial risk that this therapy will never be initiated during subsequent follow‐ups or will be started with significant delay and an increase in mortality. Conversely, improved survival is favored by and proportional to the number of GDMTs that can be introduced. Some consensuses advocate for the introduction of the 4 pillars at least at a small dose, rather than prioritizing only 1 family, but the level of evidence remains poor. The 2022 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Failure Society of America guidelines also emphasize the recommendation that in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction requiring hospitalization, preexisting GDMT should be maintained whenever possible. They further highlight that the cornerstone of AHF management is the effectiveness of the decongestion strategy, recommending the addition of a second diuretic alongside loop diuretics when diuresis is inadequate to relieve symptoms. This approach could potentially include the use of SGLT2is. Whether in acute or chronic settings, it is often the fear of side effects (AKI, hypotension, ketoacidosis) that makes physicians reluctant to introduce and uptitrate GDMT, in both American and European reports. Our meta‐analysis demonstrates that, on the contrary, the introduction of SGLT2is before discharge can be performed safely, without increasing the risk of adverse events, while reducing all‐cause death by 46%, compared with 26% in the overall cohort, also including patients with introduction within 3 days after discharge. Therefore, their widespread and rapid use represents a significant opportunity to reduce post‐AHF death, which remains unacceptably high.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy after hospitalization for acute heart failure: insights from the CONNECT-HF [^e0e31568]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Significant gap remains in the implementation of guideline‐directed medical therapy (GDMT) in patients with heart failure after a hospitalization. We aimed to evaluate the use and titration of GDMT at discharge and over a 12‐month period after hospital discharge and to identify factors associated with GDMT use and titration.

Methods and Results

The CONNECT‐HF (Care Optimization Through Patient and Hospital Engagement Clinical Trial for Heart Failure) trial evaluated the effect of a hospital and postdischarge quality improvement intervention in participants with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. In this secondary analysis, we examined use and titration to at least 50% of the target dose of GDMTs at hospital discharge and over time. Among 4646 participants (mean age 63 years, 34% women), GDMT use did not numerically improve from discharge to 12 months: beta blockers (84%–78%), angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers/angiotensin receptor‐neprilysin inhibitors (73%–65%), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (39%–36%), and sodium‐glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (1.5%–2.1%). Achieving ≥ 50% of the target dose also showed little change over 12 months: beta blockers (35%–32%), angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers/angiotensin receptor‐neprilysin inhibitors (28%–25%). For all medications, use of GDMT at discharge was associated with the use and achieving ≥ 50% of the target dose at 12 months.

Conclusions

Following a hospitalization for heart failure, GDMT use remained low and did not numerically improve over 12 months. Use of GDMT at discharge was significantly associated with the use of GDMT over time, highlighting the importance of initiating GDMT during hospitalization.

### Safety indicators in patients receiving high-intensity care after hospital admission for acute heart failure: the STRONG-HF trial [^aea8a71e]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of Rapid Optimization, Helped by NT-proBNP Testing, of Heart Failure Therapies (STRONG-HF) demonstrated the safety and efficacy of rapid up-titration of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) with high-intensity care (HIC) compared with usual care in patients hospitalized for acute heart failure (HF). In the HIC group, the following safety indicators were used to guide up-titration: estimated glomerular filtration rate of < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, serum potassium of > 5.0 mmol/L, systolic blood pressure (SBP) of < 95 mmHg, heart rate of < 55 bpm, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide concentration of > 10% higher than predischarge values.

Methods and Results

We examined the impact of protocol-specified safety indicators on achieved dose of GDMT and clinical outcomes. Three hundred thirteen of the 542 patients in the HIC arm (57.7%) met ≥ 1 safety indicator at any follow-up visit 1–6 weeks after discharge. As compared with those without, patients meeting ≥ 1 safety indicator had more severe HF symptoms, lower SBP, and higher heart rate at baseline and achieved a lower average percentage of GDMT optimal doses (mean difference vs the HIC arm patients not reaching any safety indicator, -11.0% [95% confidence interval [CI] -13.6 to -8.4%], P < .001). The primary end point of 180-day all-cause death or HF readmission occurred in 15.0% of patients with any safety indicator vs 14.2% of those without (adjusted hazard ratio 0.84, 95% CI 0.48–1.46, P = 0.540). None of each of the safety indicators, considered alone, was significantly associated with the primary end point, but an SBP of < 95 mm Hg was associated with a trend toward increased 180-day all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 2.68, 95% CI 0.94–7.64, P = 0.065) and estimated glomerular filtration rate decreased to < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 with more HF readmissions (adjusted hazard ratio 3.60, 95% CI 1.22–10.60, P = 0.0203). The occurrence of a safety indicator was associated with a smaller 90-day improvement in the EURO-QoL 5-Dimension visual analog scale (adjusted mean difference -3.32 points, 95% CI -5.97 to -0.66, P = 0.015).

Conclusions

Among patients with acute HF enrolled in STRONG-HF in the HIC arm, the occurrence of any safety indicator was associated with the administration of slightly lower GDMT doses and less improvement in quality of life, but with no significant increase in the primary outcome of 180-day HF readmission or death when appropriately addressed according to the study protocol.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) — hypertension — Clinical trials assessing the impact of goal blood pressure reduction on outcomes in patients with HFrEF and hypertension are lacking, and the optimal blood pressure goal and antihypertensive regimen are not known; antihypertensive therapy is associated with a decrease in incident heart failure in the general population with a more stringent SBP target < 120 mm Hg, whereas low blood pressure not due to antihypertensive treatment has been associated with poor outcomes in HFrEF. Nevertheless, hypertension in patients with HFrEF represents an opportunity to maximize guideline‑directed medical therapy (GDMT) to goal blood pressures defined by the ACC/AHA hypertension guidelines.

Introduction and background

The burden of heart failure (HF) in the UK is increasing and is now similar to the four most common cancers combined.HF accounts for 2% of the total National Health Service budget, with 70% of these costs due to hospitalisations. Optimal guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), a standardised treatment approach for managing patients with HF, is estimated to reduce unplanned hospital admissions, lower mortality by > 70% and improve quality of life. The absence of GDMT can increase the risk of a person dying from HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) by 29%.

In the UK, the HF patient care pathway generally begins with a referral from primary care to a hospital for suspected HF based on clinical symptoms, ECG findings and elevated levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP). If the diagnosis is confirmed, hospital treatment stabilises patients and discharges them back into the community with a treatment plan including GDMT. However, many HF patients are not yet on optimal therapy at discharge due to several factors including patient drug tolerability, blood pressure or renal function concerns. General Practitioners (GPs) and other primary healthcare professionals are expected to continue optimising GDMT to target doses as per National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) or European Society of Cardiology guidelines.

Hence, primary care has a central role in preventing hospitalisations by providing optimal care for HF patients including GDMT. But GDMT remains underused in general practice. An analysis by NICE demonstrated that nationally, only the minority of patients on HF registers in primary care are on optimal therapy. This suboptimal management is compounded by the growing burden of HF and the mounting lack of GP capacity to optimise HF care. In 2021/2022, there was an estimated shortage of around 4200 full-time equivalent GPs in England and 200 000 new cases of HF annually.

Innovative solutions are necessary to address the GP capacity shortage in delivering GDMT and improve patient outcomes. While the contribution of pharmacists in managing HF GDMT in secondary care has long been supported, there is a paucity of data on the impact of pharmacist-led GDMT in primary care. Furthermore, there is little evidence on how primary care pharmacists could safely contribute to HF GDMT. Our aim was therefore to evaluate the optimisation of HF patients by using a novel pharmacist-led GDMT model in primary care.
