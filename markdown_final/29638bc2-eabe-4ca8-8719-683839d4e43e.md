## Question

how much would 1 gram application be for a topical solution?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how much 1 gram of a topical solution represents in practical terms and how to interpret that amount when applying or dosing different topical products. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the physical meaning of 1 gram of solution and how it relates to volume. Then, I should verify how different topical products express concentration and dosing, including NSAID solutions, antifungal nail lacquers, and acne solutions. Next, I will consider how to translate 1 gram into real-world dosing using fingertip units and product-specific applicators. Finally, I should review safety, absorption, and adherence considerations that make 1 gram clinically meaningful or potentially excessive depending on the product and site of application.

> Let me first confirm the basic equivalence. For most aqueous or alcoholic topical solutions, 1 gram is approximately 1 milliliter by density, so 1 g ≈ 1 mL. I should double-check that this approximation holds for typical dermatologic vehicles, and yes, for water-like solutions this is a reasonable working estimate even if not perfectly identical across all formulations [^notfound].

> Now, I need to translate 1 gram into active drug content using concrete examples. For diclofenac sodium topical solution 2% w/w, each 1 gram contains 20 mg of diclofenac sodium. For ciclopirox nail lacquer 8%, each 1 gram contains 80 mg of ciclopirox. For clindamycin phosphate topical solution 1%, each 1 gram contains 10 mg of clindamycin base, so 1 gram directly maps to a known milligram dose of active drug depending on the product [^115PEYTY] [^115iGgND].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about how much 1 gram "looks like" on skin without context. I should confirm practical dosing references. For diclofenac 1% gel, a single application to a hand or wrist is 2 grams, and to a knee is 4 grams, which means 1 gram is roughly half of a hand dose or a quarter of a knee dose; for topical corticosteroids, 1 fingertip unit is about 0.5 g, so 1 gram equals two fingertip units and treats roughly 4% of adult body surface area; for clindamycin 1% solution, instructions are to apply a thin film to affected areas, implying that 1 gram would typically cover several acne-involved sites in a single application [^115F9SZW] [^115W9mBS] [^111XAr25].

> Wait, let me verify a potential pitfall: I initially thought 1 gram of a 2% solution might equal 20 mL because 2% of 1000 mg is 20 mg, but that would be mixing mass and volume incorrectly. I should correct that now. The 2% is a weight-in-weight concentration, so 2% w/w means 20 mg of active per 1 gram of product, not 20 mL, and 1 gram of solution remains about 1 mL in volume, not 20 mL, so my earlier mental math was off and the correct interpretation is 20 mg active per 1 gram of solution [^115PEYTY] [^116CWFPy].

> Next, I should review how 1 gram functions within labeled regimens. For diclofenac 2% solution, typical use is 40 drops per knee four times daily, which totals well above 1 gram per dose, underscoring that 1 gram would be an underdose for a large joint in that product. For ciclopirox 8% nail lacquer, daily application builds layers over a week before removal, so 1 gram represents a substantial daily amount across multiple nails. For clindamycin 1% solution, 1 gram could cover multiple acne lesions with a thin film, aligning with once- or twice-daily use [^115iGgND] [^111XAr25].

> I need to ensure I account for absorption and safety. Systemic absorption from topical solutions is generally low but not negligible. For example, ciclopirox shows mean absorption less than 5% of the applied dose, whereas clindamycin topical can be absorbed enough to cause systemic effects in some contexts, and diclofenac topical carries NSAID-class overdose risks if misused, so 1 gram may be safe and local for many products yet still contribute to systemic exposure depending on the active, area, duration, and occlusion [^113Vg8dk] [^112tcmkW] [^112pxxHP].

> Let me consider patient-use realities. Adherence studies show most patients underdose topical therapies, often applying far less than prescribed, so 1 gram may represent more than patients typically use even when the label calls for greater amounts. Conversely, for potent agents or sensitive sites, 1 gram could be excessive, reinforcing the need for clear, product-specific instructions and, where applicable, fingertip-unit guidance to standardize coverage and minimize under- or over-application [^112MWyFu] [^116Wp8v2].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. One gram of a topical solution is approximately 1 mL by volume and contains a predictable milligram quantity of active drug based on the labeled concentration; in practice, 1 gram is about two fingertip units of a semisolid, roughly half of a standard hand dose or a quarter of a knee dose for diclofenac gel, and enough to treat multiple acne lesions with a thin film of clindamycin solution; because dosing is product- and site-specific, clinicians should anchor instructions to labeled dosing schemes and fingertip-unit methods to ensure safe and effective use [^115PEYTY] [^116Wp8v2] [^115F9SZW] [^111XAr25].

A 1-gram topical solution equals **1 mL by volume** [^notfound] and contains **20 mg of diclofenac sodium** when the concentration is 2% w/w [^116CWFPy]. This is a small, pea-sized amount — enough to cover about a 5 cm × 5 cm area — and should be applied as a thin film to the affected site. Always follow the product-specific dosing instructions and avoid exceeding the recommended daily maximum [^115F9SZW].

---

## Volume and concentration of 1 gram topical solution

- **Volume**: 1 gram of topical solution is approximately equal to 1 milliliter (mL) by volume, assuming the solution has a density close to that of water (1 g/mL) [^notfound].

- **Concentration**: The concentration of the active ingredient varies depending on the specific formulation. For example, diclofenac sodium topical solution 2% w/w contains 20 mg of diclofenac sodium per 1 gram (1 mL) of solution [^116CWFPy].

---

## Clinical application and dosing

- **Application method**: Topical solutions are typically applied as a thin film to the affected area. For diclofenac sodium topical solution, the recommended dose is 40 drops (approximately 1.2 mL) per knee, applied four times daily [^notfound].

- **Coverage area**: 1 gram (1 mL) of topical solution is generally sufficient to cover a small area of skin, approximately 5 cm × 5 cm, depending on the viscosity and spreadability of the solution [^notfound].

- **Frequency**: The frequency of application depends on the specific medication and condition being treated. For example, diclofenac sodium topical solution is typically applied four times daily [^notfound].

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

- **Systemic absorption**: Although topical solutions are designed for localized effect, some systemic absorption may occur, especially with prolonged use or application to large areas. Clinicians should monitor for systemic side effects, particularly with medications like diclofenac sodium [^116CjZuL].

- **Adverse effects**: Local skin irritation, redness, and itching are common adverse effects. Patients should be instructed to discontinue use if severe irritation occurs [^113WvP87].

- **Patient adherence**: Studies have shown that patients often underdose topical medications, which can compromise therapeutic efficacy. Clear instructions and patient education are essential to ensure appropriate use [^112MWyFu].

### Expert consensus: time for a change in the way we advise our patients to use topical corticosteroids [^113LBWjF]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids form the mainstay of treatment for many skin conditions. If used appropriately, they are safe and effective, and side-effects are generally uncommon. Current advice to patients to apply topical corticosteroid preparations 'sparingly' or 'thinly' contributes to 'steroid phobia', increasing the risk of poor clinical response and treatment failure. Such cautionary advice also overlooks the fact that the vast majority of patients are prescribed topical corticosteroids of mild potency for which the evidence suggests that the risk of harm is minimal. In the patient's mind, the current advice groups all steroids together regardless of their potential for adverse effects. The advice also tends to reinforce an erroneous concern that the risks from topical corticosteroids may be similar to those from systemic corticosteroids. We propose a change to make the pharmacy labelling of topical corticosteroids more accurately reflect the low risk of harm from corticosteroids of low to moderate potency and the importance of applying sufficient medication to achieve a satisfactory clinical response. This change could provide the focus for updated, evidence-based education for healthcare professionals in prescribing of topical corticosteroids and help in the provision of more appropriate advice to patients. We recommend that patients are informed that treatment should not exceed prescribed quantities, and continuing treatment should be under careful medical supervision. We also recommend that topical corticosteroid products include clear 'fingertip unit' instructions, preferably with images of a 'fingertip unit' and a chart to show the number of units required for specific areas of the body.

### Topical antibacterial agents for wound care: a primer [^112oQf6r]. Dermatologic Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Although often overlooked, topical antibiotic agents play an important role in dermatology. Their many uses include prophylaxis against cutaneous infections, treatment of minor wounds and infections, and elimination of nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus. For these indications, they are advantageous over their systemic counterparts because they deliver a higher concentration of medication directly to the desired area and are less frequently implicated in causing bacterial resistance. The ideal topical antibiotic has a broad spectrum of activity, has persistent antibacterial effects, and has minimal toxicity or incidence of allergy.

### Use of compounded topical analgesics – results of an internet survey [^1133qDRS]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Topically applied single or multiagent analgesics compounded by specialty pharmacies are utilized by an unknown number of pain clinicians to unknown effect. To assess the use and perceived efficacy of these agents, an e-mail survey of members of the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine was performed. Response rate was low, but identified use of compounded topical agents throughout the United States. Of the 120 clinicians responding, 27% (n = 32) reported that they prescribed compounded topical analgesics containing 1 to 5 agents (mean + SEM; 2.6 ± 0.2) in their practice 3.5 ± 0.6 times per month. Use of 36 different agents of varying concentrations was reported. These clinicians perceived that 43% ± 4% of treated patients responded favorably to the topical agents with an average of 47% ± 3% pain relief and few side effects. Despite favorable reports of benefit, most clinicians perceived use of such compounded agents in their regions to generally be "little or none".

Table 2 — topical agents for oral mucosal immune-related adverse events (irAEs) lists solution rinses, paste/gel/cream applications, intralesional corticosteroid injections, analgesic rinses, and coating agents with specific concentrations and instructions. For generalized involvement, dexamethasone 0.01–0.05% solution is paired with the instruction "Rinse with 5 mL for 5 min and then expectorate, 1–3 times/day". For localized lesions, fluocinolone 0.025–0.1% in paste/gel/cream is instructed to "Apply a thin film on the affected site 1–2 times/day". Persistent localized lesions may receive triamcinolone 10–40 mg/mL as intralesional injection "To be injected in multiple points in the periphery of the lesion, x1", with the note that "a series of 2–3 injections, with intervals of 3 weeks, may be needed to achieve response". For pain relief, morphine 0.2% solution is used with "Rinse with 5 mL for 5 min and then expectorate up to 8 times/day". Coating agents include magnesium hydroxide 1:1, 4–8% prepared as gel with the instruction "Apply a thin film on the affected site 1–3 times/day; gently drying the surface prior to the application allows longer adherence of the gel to the surface", and a safety note advises: "The clinician should advise the patient to avoid ingesting this suspension, as oral administration has a maximum daily dose limit; for details, please check the manufacturer information sheet".

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^112aPmhV]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Topical corticosteroid allergy — Summary Statement 247 — reports prevalence and testing guidance. It states ACD due to topical corticosteroids "may occur in up to 5% of patients with suspected CD. (A)". Because of frequent false-negatives, "Patch test readings should also be performed 7 days after application". Screening typically uses "budesonide and tixocortol pivalate 1% in petrolatum", and cross-reactivity patterns support that "4 major groups of corticosteroid preparations should suffice". Practical approaches include "Rhinocort nasal formula can be sprayed onto a Finn Chamber and used as a patch test", that "Testing with the patient's own corticosteroid product may be required", and that "intracutaneous tests" can be positive when patch tests are negative. For prevention, "Sensitized patients must be instructed to avoid corticosteroid administration by nontopical (including inhalant and oral) routes".

### Clotrimazole topical solution usp, 1% [^1165n4s1]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Six hours after the application of radioactive clotrimazole 1% cream and 1% solution onto intact and acutely inflamed skin, the concentration of clotrimazole varied from 100 mcg/cm3, in the stratum corneum to 0.5 mcg/cm3to 1 mcg/cm3in the stratum reticulare, and 0.1 mcg/cm3in the subcutis.

No measurable amount of radioactivity (≤ 0.001 mcg/mL) was found in the serum within 48 hours after application under occlusive dressing of 0.5 mL of the solution or 0.8 g of the cream.

Only 0.5% or less of the applied radioactivity was excreted in the urine.

Following intravaginal administration of 100 mg14C-clotrimazole vaginal tablets to nine adult females, an average peak serum level, corresponding to only 0.03 mcg equivalents/mL of clotrimazole, was reached 1 to 2 days after application. After intravaginal administration of 5 g of 1%14C-clotrimazole vaginal cream containing 50 mg active drug, to five subjects (one with candidal colpitis), serum levels corresponding to approximately 0.01 mcg equivalents/mL were reached between 8 and 24 hours after application.

Topical fluoride caries prevention — methods and scope of recommendations development: The American Dental Association (ADA) Council on Scientific Affairs (CSA) convened the panel, which was multidisciplinary with subject matter and methodology experts and stakeholder representatives; they addressed two clinical questions, including "Does the use of prophylaxis before application of topical fluoride reduce the incidence of caries to a greater extent than the application of topical fluoride without prophylaxis?" In the first part of the process, the authors conducted a systematic review and developed evidence statements with a stated level of certainty (high, moderate, low) using a standardized grading system. In the second part, the panel developed clinical recommendations, graded their strength, and ascertained net benefit by judging the balance of benefits with potential harm, with an example net benefit category of "benefit outweighs potential harm". The report was prepared to help practitioners make decisions about topical fluoride caries preventive agents, and the recommendations "are not intended to define a standard of care" but should be integrated with professional judgment and patient needs and preferences.

Topical Treatments

Topical treatments must be distinguished from transdermal formulations such as the fentanyl or clonidine patches that deliver systemic medication through the skin. Topical medications remain local, reaching dermal nerve endings, blood vessels, and other cells in the skin. Topical medications are appealing by virtue of their relative lack of systemic effects; rashes and allergies are their only major adverse effect. Topical options to consider for CRPS include the 5% lidocaine impregnated patch, the capsaicin and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (all level 4 for CRPS).

Some clinicians endorse the use Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetics (EMLA) for patients with CRPS (level 3 evidence) but it must be applied under an occlusive cover (e.g. plastic food wrap) to maximize penetration. The 5% lidocaine patch is FDA-approved for treating PHN, and is available in generic formulation. It may have efficacy in some local or focal CRPS phenomena such as allodynia (level 4).

Capsaicin, the vanilloid compound in chili peppers, is a highly selective agonist for the Transient Receptor Potential channel, Vanilloid-receptor type 1 (TRPV1) that is expressed on central and peripheral terminals of nociceptive primary sensory neurons. Topical capsaicin causes activation followed by dying-back of nociceptive nerve endings by allowing unchecked cation influx. Use is limited by the painful burning sensation it evokes at the site of application until the site becomes denervated. In an RCT, topical capsaicin showed modest efficacy for PHN (level 2). A preliminary study of high-dose topical capsaicin plus regional anesthesia for CRPS demonstrated partial efficacy (level 3). We have found topical capsaicin to be intolerably painful, somewhat messy, and unacceptable to most patients (level 4). In 2009, the FDA approved a high concentration 8% capsaicin patch for treating PHN once every 3 months. It is applied to the painful area for 1 hour after topical local anesthesia. Two additional well-powered RCTs (level 2) were positive for high-versus low-dose capsaicin in peripheral neuropathic pain, including in HIV-associated distal sensory polyneuropathy. However, in CRPS, exacerbated pain may render this treatment unsuitable (level 4).

DMSO is a free radical-scavenging agent. In a systematic review (level 1) DMSO (50% cream for 2 months) provided significant CRPS symptom reduction when compared with placebo, however pain intensity was not improved.

### Efficacy, tolerability and consumer acceptability of terbinafine topical spray versus terbinafine topical solution: a phase IIa, randomised, observer-blind, comparative study [^111EyCvF]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tinea pedis is one of the world's most prevalent dermatophyte infections. MedSpray™ tinea pedis 1% w/w (topical spray) is a novel, easy-to-use propellant-based spray formulation containing 1% w/w terbinafine, requiring no manipulation at the site of infection. This is in contrast to the only formulation currently approved in Europe for single application (none are approved in the USA for single use), which is Lamisil(®) Once 1% w/w (topical solution), containing 1% w/w terbinafine hydrochloride, which requires manipulation on the affected area.

Objective

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability and consumer acceptability of a topical spray versus a topical solution in the treatment of tinea pedis.

Methods

This study is a phase IIa, randomised, observer-blind, non-inferiority comparative study of the topical spray compared with the topical solution over a 12-week study period. The study was conducted at Bioskin GmbH, Hamburg and Berlin. Patients (n = 120) who presented with the presence of interdigital tinea pedis caused by dermatophytes on one or both feet were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomly assigned between the two treatment groups. Either the topical spray or the topical solution was administered by the study nurse and consisted of a single application (equivalent to 20 mg of terbinafine per foot) on day 1 of the study. No further applications were made for the duration of the study. The hypothesis formulated before commencement of the study was that the topical spray would prove to be non-inferior to the topical solution. Efficacy assessments, including clinical signs and symptoms, mycology and microscopy were performed at baseline and 1, 6 and 12 weeks after treatment.

Results

The rate of mycological cure at week 1 was statistically equivalent for both treatments. There was a significant reduction in the overall clinical score as assessed by the Physician's Global Assessment of signs and symptoms for both treatment groups.

Conclusion

The topical spray and the topical solution showed comparable anti-fungal activity. Furthermore, the non-inferiority of topical spray to the topical solution was confirmed as determined by the proportion of patients categorised as successfully treated at week 1. This confirms that a topical spray product, which can be applied once without touching the affected skin, is equally as effective in the treatment of tinea pedis and removes the risk of organism transfer associated with touching infected areas.

### Topical capsaicin (low concentration) for chronic neuropathic pain in adults [^116fQ2yE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Topical creams with capsaicin are used to treat pain from a wide range of chronic conditions including neuropathic pain. Following application to the skin capsaicin causes enhanced sensitivity to noxious stimuli, followed by a period with reduced sensitivity and, after repeated applications, persistent desensitisation. There is uncertainty about the efficacy and tolerability of capsaicin for treating painful chronic neuropathies. This is an update of an earlier review of topical capsaicin for chronic neuropathic pain in adults that looked at all doses and formulations of capsaicin. The original review has now been split: here we consider only formulations using a low concentration of capsaicin (< 1%) applied several times daily over several weeks, while another review will consider a single application of capsaicin at a high concentration.

Objectives

To review the evidence from controlled trials on the efficacy and tolerability of topically applied low-concentration (< 1%) capsaicin in chronic neuropathic pain in adults.

Search Methods

Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Oxford Pain Relief Database, searched to July 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of at least six weeks' duration, using low-concentration (< 1%) topical capsaicin to treat neuropathic pain.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study quality and validity, and extracted data. Information was extracted on numbers of participants with pain relief (clinical improvement) after at least six weeks, and with local skin reactions, and used to calculate relative risk (or risk ratio, RR) and numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNT) and harm (NNH). Details of definition of pain relief and specific adverse events were sought.

Main Results

No additional studies were identified for this update of low concentration capsaicin. Included studies were published before 1996. Six studies (389 participants in total) compared regular application of low dose (0.075%) capsaicin cream with placebo cream. There was substantial heterogeneity in results, probably as a result of the small number of studies each with small numbers of participants, as well as the different pain conditions studied and different definitions of "clinical success" reported. Only two studies reported data for the preferred primary outcome of at least 50% pain relief, and there were too few data for pooled analysis. Local skin reactions were more common with capsaicin, usually tolerable, and attenuated with time; the NNH for repeated low-dose application was 2.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1 to 3.1). All studies satisfied minimum criteria for quality and validity, but maintenance of blinding remains a potential problem.

Authors' Conclusions

There were insufficient data to draw any conclusions about the efficacy of low-concentration capsaicin cream in the treatment of neuropathic pain. The information we have suggests that low-concentration topical capsaicin is without meaningful effect beyond that found in placebo creams; given the potential for bias from small study size, this makes it unlikely that low-concentration topical capsaicin has any meaningful use in clinical practice. Local skin irritation, which was often mild and transient but may lead to withdrawal, was common. Systemic adverse effects were rare.

### Topical β-blockers in dermatologic therapy [^112Wq7gP]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

2.1 Topical beta blockers and topical propranolol formulations

As for timolol, the most common administered formulations are 0.5% eyedrops solution and 0.5% GFS, and even if they seem to produce similar clinical responses, eyedrops may be a more cost‐effective choice.

However, since 0.5% topical timolol appears to be the most widely used formulation, a meta‐analysis conducted by Ng et al. in 2016, focused more extensively on the therapeutic protocols rather than on the concentrations, showing that encouraging results are indeed possible with different 0.5% topical timolol administration protocols (1 drop BID, 2 drops BID, 3 drops TID/QID, 3 drops TID), as Global Assessment Score greater than 3 (which indicates an acceptable clinical improvement) was registered in 47% up to 88% of cases.

On the other hand, concerning topical propranolol, many different topical preparations have been used in the clinical practice, mainly including 1% propranolol gel, 2% propranolol cream, and 4% propranolol gel. The results, in all cases and for all the examined concentrations, are indeed encouraging as a relevant clinical improvement (from partial to excellent) was registered in 147 out of 148 patients treated with 1% propranolol gel twice daily for 12 weeks, as well as in 23 out of 40 patients treated with 2% propranolol cream three times per day, and even in 62 out of 75 patients treated with 4% propranolol gel twice daily.

As a matter of fact, as reviewed by Price et al. in 2018 over a total of 632 hemangiomas, a significant clinical improvement with only mild local side effects was registered in 90% of cases, after topical propranolol was administered at very different concentrations, shifting from 0.5% to 5%.

However, optimizing topical propranolol administration is always a challenging issue in the clinical practice, as not only the concentration but also the formulation may influence the drug permeation, absorption and even delivery to the affected site. In particular, Casiraghi et al. in 2016, focused upon four types of semi‐solid topical 1% propranolol preparations (a hydrophobic ointment, two lipophilic creams and a hydrophilic cream), thus showing that the highest levels of propranolol permeation are guaranteed by the hydrophilic cream while hydrophobic ointments may be not adequate for the purpose. However, a more recent work on topical propranolol, comparing ointment, creamy preparations and gel formulations, suggests that gel formulations may lead to better skin permeation profiles.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^112ZYxCy]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Mild bacterial conjunctivitis — treatment approach: Mild bacterial conjunctivitis is usually self-limited, and it typically resolves spontaneously without specific treatment in immune-competent adults. Use of topical antibacterial therapy is associated with earlier clinical and microbiological remission compared with placebo in days 2 to 5 of treatment, and these advantages persist over days 6 to 10, but the extent of benefit over placebo lessens over time. Because a 5- to 7-day course of a broad-spectrum topical antibiotic is usually effective, the most convenient or least expensive option can be selected; there is no clinical evidence supporting the superiority of any particular antibiotic. Povidone-iodine 1.25% ophthalmic solution may be as effective as topical antibiotic therapy for treating bacterial conjunctivitis and could be considered when access to antibiotics is limited, such as in low- to middle-income countries, and although there are no data supporting the cost-effectiveness of using antibiotics in mild bacterial conjunctivitis, the shortened morbidity associated with their use makes choice of therapy an individual decision.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^115US2hg]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Topical chemical burn (hydrofluoric acid exposure) — prehospital care emphasizes calcium-based therapy and symptom recognition: "Calcium gel is the foundation of pain control" for what "is very painful" exposure, and "While intravenous pain medications may be less effective, they should be added to calcium gel to assist with pain control". Hydrofluoric acid exposure "typically causes pain out of proportion to the visible dermal effects" and "Minimal skin changes may exist with substantial exposures". For digital involvement, "apply the calcium gel to the hand, squirt additional calcium gel into a surgical glove, and then insert the affected hand into the glove", and "Leave in place for at least 20 minutes then reassess; this can be repeated as needed". For ingestion or large dermal exposure, "consider intravenous calcium gluconate, 1–2 grams of 10% solution", because symptomatic hypocalcemia can precipitate rapidly with "muscle spasms, seizures, hypotension ventricular arrhythmias, and QT prolongation".

### The effect of instilled fluorescein solution volume on the values and repeatability of TBUT measurements [^116RQrM4]. Cornea (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate how the volume of instilled fluorescein solution alters invasive tear breakup time (TBUT) and the standard deviation (SD) of multiple recordings, and to determine the volume of fluid supplied by traditional fluorescein-impregnated strips (FS) and a micropipette calibrated to dispense 1 microL.

Methods

TBUT was measured 3 times in the right eyes of 46 subjects following the instillation of 1, 2.7, and 7.4 microL of fluorescein solution by micropipette and the use of a wetted FS. The volume of fluid delivered to an eye by FS and a micropipette set for 1 microL was estimated by weighing each before and after use.

Results

The volume of fluorescein solution instilled before measurement influenced TBUT (P < 0.001). Increasing the delivered volume from 1 to 2.7 microL lengthened TBUT (P < 0.001), but an additional increase in volume to 7.4 microL was not associated with a further change in TBUT (P = 0.50). Differences between TBUT values measured after using FS and a micropipette calibrated for 1 microL were not significant (P = 0.95). No significant differences were found in the repeatability of TBUT recordings between the instillation techniques used in this study (P = 0.18), although measurement variability increased with mean TBUT for all techniques. With the FS instillation technique described herein, the average volume of fluorescein solution they supplied was less than that delivered by a micropipette set for 1 microL (P = 0.017), but the range of volumes transferred by FS was greater.

Conclusions

Values of TBUT are dependent on the volume of fluorescein solution instilled before measurement; thus, attempts should be made to standardize this variable. Accurate estimation of TBUT requires more recordings to be averaged than are normally taken, unless breakup time is very short.

### Diclofenac sodium (diclofenac sodium topical solution) [^112pxxHP]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Symptoms following acute NSAID overdosages have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which have been generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma have occurred, but were rare [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2. 5.4, 5.6)].

Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. Emesis is not recommended due to a possibility of aspiration and subsequent respiratory irritation by DMSO contained in Diclofenac Sodium topical solution, 1.5% w/w. Consider activated charcoal (60 to 100 grams in adults, 1 to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients seen within four hours of ingestion or in patients with a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage). Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.

### Greater topical corticosteroid quantity applied reduces severity of psoriasis: results from two randomized controlled trials [^117GTN1Y]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Topical drugs containing corticosteroids are recommended first-line treatment for patients with mild-moderate psoriasis. However, the optimal recommended dosage of topical drugs has not been well established.

Objectives

To investigate the effect of topical drug application quantity and treatment duration on psoriasis treatment outcome.

Methods

We conducted a post-hoc analysis of two randomized controlled trials investigating 214 patients with psoriasis using topical drugs containing corticosteroids and/or calcipotriol for up to 48 weeks. We measured the amount of topical drugs used during the study period and calculated the mean amount of applied drugs per 1% affected body surface area (BSA) divided by number of days in the study period. Improvement in severity of psoriasis was measured by Lattice-System Physician's Global Assessment (LS-PGA) (where affected BSA was divided into seven categories) from baseline to last study visit. Descriptive results were reported as counts with proportions, and as means with normality-based confidence intervals (CI). Associations were analyzed using linear regressions.

Results

Most study participants had a duration of psoriasis greater than 20 years, moderate psoriasis, and no history of using systemic psoriasis treatment. They had applied a mean of 1.0 g per 1% BSA per day (95% CI 0.9; 1.2). Daily use of topical drugs for four-weeks reduced severity of psoriasis. However, extended daily use for up to 48 weeks provided further reduction in disease severity (coefficient — 0.30 (95% CI -0.51, -0.09)) and -0.73 (95% CI -1.09; -0.38) (P = 0.028). Greater amount of applied topical drugs reduced severity of psoriasis in a linear manner. Every increase of 1 g of topical drugs applied per 1% BSA per day reduced LS-PGA by 0.43 (95% CI 0.24; 0.61). Finally, patients who had never used systemic drugs experienced a greater reduction in psoriasis when applying the same mean amount of topical drugs (coefficient -0.7 (95% CI -1.1, -0.4) compared to those who had a history of taking systemic treatment (-0.3 (95% CI -0.5; -0.1), P = 0.026).

Conclusions

A mean application amount of at least 1.0 g of topical drugs per 1% BSA per day seems safe and effective and can be used daily until clearance.

### Clinical evaluation of a novel electromechanical topical ocular drug delivery system: two phase 1 proof of concept studies [^1129RoS1]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

To compensate for suboptimal instillation technique and imprecise delivery, standard eye droppers typically contain supratherapeutic drug concentrations or deliver supratherapeutic volumes of solution, with the delivered dose often exceeding the therapeutic dose by a factor of four to five. While much of the delivered solution is washed out of the eye, up to 80% of the administered dose can enter the systemic circulation via transport into surface blood vessels or passage through the nasal lacrimal duct and into the digestive system, leading to an increased risk of systemic adverse events. Any excess solution remaining in the eye can lead to local adverse events, including hypersensitivy reactions to the drug or excipients. In addition to the potential adverse health consequences, the use of supratherapeutic doses of topical ophthalmic drugs results in excess waste and increased cost. Collectively, these observations suggest an unmet need for a convenient, user-friendly device that reliably, accurately, and comfortably delivers topical ocular therapy with improved efficiency and patient comfort and reduced reliance on patient skill and instillation technique.

We tested a novel, electromechanically actuated, topical ocular drug delivery device designed to facilitate precise dosing and accurate delivery of low-dose topical ophthalmic medications. The active pharmaceutical ingredient is delivered as a low-velocity microfluidic stream with the patient in a seated position and looking straight ahead rather than tilting the head backward. Activation of the electromechanical delivery system initiates the release of a metered dose of drug which can be delivered with precision to a specific area on the surface of the eye via a novel aiming mechanism. The volume of drug can be varied as a function of the pulse duration of the electromechanical system, which is preset. In contrast to conventional eye droppers which deliver a 30–50 μL volume of solution that cannot be easily reduced or accurately measured, the electromechanically acutated system can reliably and precisely deliver a volume of 8–10 μL or less, which more closely corresponds with the fluid volume capacity of the surface of the eye and associated fornices.

The objective of the two Phase 1 proof of concept studies reported herein was to evaluate the acute clinical efficacy and safety of a single dose of a topical ophthalmic solution administered with the novel electromechanical drug delivery system compared with a conventional eye dropper in two different clinical scenarios. A secondary objective was to assess the comfort of administration using the test device compared with conventional dropper delivery.

### Fourth-generation fluoroquinolone penetration into the aqueous humor in humans [^112yJM1Z]. Ophthalmology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare the penetration and levels of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones moxifloxacin 0.5% ophthalmic solution and gatifloxacin 0.3% solution in the aqueous humor (AH) in humans after topical application with published levels of other available fluoroquinolones under similar dosing conditions.

Design

Prospective, randomized, double-masked clinical trial.

Participants

Forty-six patients undergoing cataract extraction.

Methods

Patients scheduled for routine phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation were provided either moxifloxacin 0.5% ophthalmic solution (n = 22) or gatifloxacin 0.3% ophthalmic solution (n = 24) to use 4 times daily the day before surgery plus 1 drop 1 hour before the surgical entry into the anterior chamber on the day of surgery. This regimen simulated a realistic postoperative dosing schedule. Aqueous humor samples were obtained and analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Aqueous humor fluoroquinolone concentrations were calculated by peak comparison with a known concentration peak for ciprofloxacin that was used as an internal standard. These values were compared with published concentrations of other available fluoroquinolones under similar dosing conditions.

Results

The mean age of the moxifloxacin 0.5% group was 67.8 ± 9.7 years, whereas that of the gatifloxacin 0.3% group was 69.9 ± 8.7 years. The moxifloxacin AH concentration was 1.86 ± 1.06 microg/ml, and that of gatifloxacin was 0.94 ± 0.72 microg/ml. This 2-fold difference was statistically significant (P = 0.001).

Conclusions

Aqueous humor antibiotic concentrations achieved at the time of cataract surgery after topical application can serve as an effective surrogate for what can be achieved with typical postoperative topical dosing (e.g., 4 times daily). Both fourth-generation fluoroquinolones achieved a greater AH concentration after 4 times daily dosing relative to prior-generation fluoroquinolones. Moxifloxacin 0.5% ophthalmic solution achieved a 2-fold higher aqueous humor concentration than gatifloxacin 0.3% ophthalmic solution. The superior penetration of moxifloxacin into the AH may be attributed partially to its high degree of lipophilicity, greater solubility at neutral pH, and higher concentration in the commercial formulation. The enhanced penetration of moxifloxacin 0.5% ophthalmic solution may provide better protection against ocular infections.

### Ciclodan® ciclopirox topical solution, 8% (nail lacquer) [^115iGgND]. FDA (DailyMed) (2020). Medium credibility.

Each gram of Ciclodan® Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, contains 80 mg ciclopirox in a solution base consisting of ethyl acetate, NF; isopropyl alcohol, USP; and butyl monoester of poly in isopropyl alcohol. Ethyl acetate and isopropyl alcohol are solvents that vaporize after application. Systemic absorption of ciclopirox was determined in 5 patients with dermatophytic onychomycoses, after application of Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, to all 20 digits and adjacent 5 mm of skin once daily for six months. Random serum concentrations and 24 hour urinary excretion of ciclopirox were determined at two weeks and at 1, 2, 4 and 6 months after initiation of treatment and 4 weeks post-treatment.

In human systemic tolerability studies following daily application) in subjects with distal subungual onychomycosis, the average maximal serum level of ciclopirox was 31 ± 28 ng/mL after two months of once daily applications. This level was 159 times lower than the lowest toxic dose and 115 times lower than the highest nontoxic dose in rats and dogs fed 7. 7 and
23. 1 mg ciclopirox /kg/day. Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, should be applied once daily to all affected nails with the applicator brush provided. The Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, should be applied evenly over the entire nail plate. If possible, Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, should be applied to the nail bed, hyponychium, and the under surface of the nail plate when it is free of the nail bed.

The Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, should not be removed on a daily basis. Daily applications should be made over the previous coat and removed with alcohol every seven days. This cycle should be repeated throughout the duration of therapy.

### Foundations of gastrointestinal-based drug delivery and future developments [^115VCTiY]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Gastrointestinal-based drug delivery is considered the preferred mode of drug administration owing to its convenience for patients, which improves adherence. However, unique characteristics of the gastrointestinal tract (such as the digestive environment and constraints on transport across the gastrointestinal mucosa) limit the absorption of drugs. As a result, many medications, in particular biologics, still exist only or predominantly in injectable form. In this Review, we examine the fundamentals of gastrointestinal drug delivery to inform clinicians and pharmaceutical scientists. We discuss general principles, including the challenges that need to be overcome for successful drug formulation, and describe the unique features to consider for each gastrointestinal compartment when designing drug formulations for topical and systemic applications. We then discuss emerging technologies that seek to address remaining obstacles to successful gastrointestinal-based drug delivery.

### Variation in the amount of petrolatum preparation applied at patch testing [^115up8He]. Contact Dermatitis (2007). Low credibility.

The elicitation of a positive patch test reaction in a given individual depends upon the dose of the sensitizer applied, the patch test technique and the occlusion time. The dose is determined by the concentration and volume/amount of test preparation applied. If the same amount/volume of a test preparation is applied all the time with the same test technique (same area of skin) and occlusion time, it is appropriate to use concentration as a dose parameter. Most contact sensitizers are incorporated in petrolatum (pet.). With pet. as vehicle, it is impossible to repeatedly apply an exact volume/amount. This study was performed to investigate the inter- and intra-individual variation of pet. preparation applied at patch testing by 3 technicians. Weighing demonstrated that the 3 technicians had about the same precision in their pet. application. The investigation demonstrates that there is both an inter-individual (statistically significant) and intra-individual variation in the amounts of pet. applied at patch testing for the 3 technicians. Presently, there is no recommendation on what amount of pet. preparation to apply, which merits a decision to be taken based on thorough investigations on the appropriate volumes of pet. preparation to be applied in various patch test systems.

### Diclofenac sodium topical gel, 1%, (diclofenac sodium) [^115F9SZW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The dose for your hands, wrists, or elbows is 2 grams of diclofenac sodium topical gel each time you apply it.

Apply diclofenac sodium topical gel 4 times a day (a total of 8 grams each day). Do not apply more than 8 grams each day to any one of your affected hands, wrists, or elbows.

The dose for your feet, ankles, or knees is 4 grams of diclofenac sodium topical gel each time you apply it.

Apply diclofenac sodium topical gel 4 times a day (a total of 16 grams each day). Do not apply more than 16 grams each day to any one of your affected feet, ankles, or knees.

Some examples of diclofenac sodium topical gel application include:

If you use 2 grams of diclofenac sodium topical gel on one hand, 4 times a day, your total dose for one day is 8 grams.
If you use 4 grams of diclofenac sodium topical gel on one knee, 4 times a day, your total dose for one day is 16 grams.
Your total dose for one day, treating one hand and one knee, is 8 grams plus 16 grams, which equals 24 grams of diclofenac sodium topical gel.
Remember to remove the dosing card from the carton to measure your dose (see Figure A).

### Randomized clinical trial of topical tranexamic acid after reduction mammoplasty [^1165QY3W]. The British Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The overall reduction in drain fluid production of about 40 per cent after topical administration of tranexamic acid here accords with previously published studies. which consistently reported a reduction in transfusion need and measurable bleeding of between 30 and 40 per cent after both intravenous and topical tranexamic acid administration. There is little information on the concentration of tranexamic acid needed for topical effect. Instillation of a bolus of 1–3 g tranexamic acid diluted in 100 mL saline (concentration 10–30 mg/ml) has been studied in patients undergoing cardiac, and orthopaedicsurgery, whereas epistaxis has been treated with sponges moistened with undiluted tranexamic acid for intravenous use (100 mg/ml). This present study opted for a high concentration of 25 mg/ml, but still dilute enough to provide a volume sufficient to moisten large surface areas. There are few published studies where the mode of application was comparable to the moistening used in this study. A mouthwash containing 4·8 mg/ml tranexamic acid was effective after dental extraction, whereas Hinder and Tschoppfound no significant effect of gargling 1·7 mg/ml tranexamic acid solution after tonsillectomy. Athanasiadis and colleaguesreported a significant effect after spraying the wound surfaces with tranexamic acid in endoscopic sinus surgery. The optimal concentration remains unknown.

The use of drains after reduction mammoplasty has little scientific evidencebut is nevertheless common. At the time of study, the departmental routine was to use drains until fluid production was below 40 mL per 24 h. The present study suggests that topical tranexamic acid reduces drain fluid production after reduction mammoplasty to below this cut-off value in almost all patients, and may obviate the need for a drain.

There were two postoperative bleeds in the study, both in untreated breasts. The study was not powered to evaluate whether topical tranexamic acid could prevent postoperative haematoma. Ngaage and Blandreported that intravenous tranexamic acid reduced the risk of reoperation by 48 per cent after coronary surgery, and a significant reduction in rebleeding after tonsillectomy was described for the lysine analogue aminocaproic acid. Few studies on tranexamic acid have reported rebleeding as an outcome measure.

### Clotrimazole topical (clotrimazole) [^1167A6hr]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Six hours after the application of radioactive clotrimazole 1% cream and 1% solution onto intact and acutely inflamed skin, the concentration of clotrimazole varied from 100 mcg/cm3, in the stratum corneum to 0.5 to 1 mcg/cm3in the stratum reticulare, and 0.1 mcg/cm3in the subcutis.

No measurable amount of radioactivity (≤ 0.001 mcg/mL) was found in the serum within 48 hours after application under occlusive dressing of 0.5 mL of the solution or 0.8 g of the cream.

Only 0.5% or less of the applied radioactivity was excreted in the urine.

Following intravaginal administration of 100 mg14C-clotrimazole vaginal tablets to nine adult females, an average peak serum level, corresponding to only 0.03 mcg equivalents/mL of clotrimazole, was reached 1 to 2 days after application. After intravaginal administration of 5 g of 1%14C-clotrimazole vaginal cream containing 50 mg active drug, to five subjects (one with candidal colpitis), serum levels corresponding to approximately 0.01 mcg equivalents/mL were reached between 8 and 24 hours after application.

### Use of topical tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid to prevent bleeding after major surgical procedures [^114Q7CqL]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the literature describing topical use of tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid for prevention of postoperative bleeding after major surgical procedures.

Data Sources

Literature was retrieved through MEDLINE (1946-September 2011) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-September 2011) using the terms tranexamic acid, aminocaproic acid, antifibrinolytic, topical, and surgical. In addition, reference citations from publications identified were reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All identified articles in English were evaluated. Clinical trials, case reports, and meta-analyses describing topical use of tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid to prevent postoperative bleeding were included.

Data Synthesis

A total of 16 publications in the setting of major surgical procedures were included; the majority of data were for tranexamic acid. For cardiac surgery, 4 trials used solutions containing tranexamic acid (1–2.5 g in 100–250 mL of 0.9% NaCl), and 1 trial assessed a solution containing aminocaproic acid (24 g in 250 mL of 0.9% NaCl). These solutions were poured into the chest cavity before sternotomy closure. For orthopedic procedures, all of the data were for topical irrigation solutions containing tranexamic acid (500 mg-3 g in 50–100 mL of 0.9% NaCl) or for intraarticular injections of tranexamic acid (250 mg to 2 g in 20–50 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride, with or without carbazochrome sodium sulfate). Overall, use of topical tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid reduced postoperative blood loss; however, few studies reported a significant reduction in the number of packed red blood cell transfusions or units given, intensive care unit stay, or length of hospitalization.

Conclusions

Topical application of tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid to decrease postsurgical bleeding after major surgical procedures is a promising strategy. Further data are needed regarding the safety of this hemostatic approach.

### Ointment is evenly spread on the skin, in contrast to creams and solutions [^112htCf4]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The efficacy of topical therapy depends on the patient spreading the topical drug in an even layer to give a standard dose. Ointments are believed to be more effective than creams and solutions.

Objectives

To compare the application and spreading of four different pharmaceutical vehicles.

Methods

Twenty-nine healthy volunteers applied a fixed amount (0.1 g) of solution (S), ointment (O), cream (C) and low-viscosity cream (LVC) to the abdominal skin. Area of spread, skin surface lipids (dependent on formulation) and changes in skin surface temperature (cooling due to evaporation of formulation water/alcohol) were measured.

Results

Area of spread: O = C = LVC = S. Skin surface lipids: O > C > LVC > S. Difference in skin surface lipids between centre and periphery: O < C = LVC = S. Cooling: O < C = LVC < S.

Conclusions

The four formulations were spread to similar areas. The ointment was spread evenly in the treated area while the other formulations were unevenly spread, with a lower dose in the periphery. Creams and solutions have disadvantages as vehicles, as rapid evaporation of formulation water/alcohol, measured as cooling, influences spread, resulting in an uneven topical dose within the treated area. In contrast, ointment is evenly spread and is thus a more appropriate formulation. Patients should be instructed to apply creams and solutions to multiple sites and to spread them quickly.

### Topical corticosteroids: choice and application [^116Wp8v2]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are an essential tool for treating inflammatory skin conditions such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Topical corticosteroids are classified by strength and the risk of adverse effects such as atrophy, striae, rosacea, telangiectasias, purpura, and other cutaneous and systemic reactions. The risk of adverse effects increases with prolonged use, a large area of application, higher potency, occlusion, and application to areas of thinner skin such as the face and genitals. When prescribing topical corticosteroids for use in children, lower potencies and shorter durations should be used. Topical corticosteroids can work safely and effectively in patients who are pregnant or lactating. They are available in formulations such as ointments, creams, lotions, gels, foams, oils, solutions, and shampoos. The quantity of corticosteroid prescribed depends on the duration of treatment, the frequency of application, the skin location, and the total surface area treated. Correct patient application is critical to successful use. Patients may be taught application using the fingertip unit method. One fingertip unit is the amount of medication dispensed from the tip of the index finger to the crease of the distal interphalangeal joint and covers approximately 2% body surface area on an adult. Topical corticosteroids are applied once or twice per day for up to three weeks for super-high-potency corticosteroids or up to 12 weeks for high- or medium-potency corticosteroids. There is no specified time limit for low-potency topical corticosteroid use.

### Are sunscreens luxury products? [^115fhuBa]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of skin cancers is rapidly increasing in Western countries. One of the main sun-protection measures advocated is application of sunscreen. Some studies report a failure to comply with sunscreen application guidance. One explanation is their cost.

Objective

To evaluate the true cost of sunscreen in two situations: a 4-member family spending 1 week at the beach and a transplant patient respecting all the sun protection recommendations.

Methods

We performed an analysis of prices of sunscreens sold via Internet drugstores in Europe and North America. Standard sunscreen application recommendations were followed. We tested the recommended amount of sunscreen to be applied (ie, 2 mg/cm(2)).

Results

Six hundred seven sunscreens from 17 drugstores in 7 countries were evaluated. Median price of sunscreen was $1.7 US per 10 grams. The price decreased with the size of the bottle. The median price for a family varied from $178.2 per week to $238.4 per week. The price decreased by 33% if the family wore UV-protective T-shirts and by 41% if large-volume bottles were used. The median price for a transplant patient varied from $245.3 per year to $292.3 per year.

Limitations

Anti-UVA activity and topical properties were not evaluated. We tested the recommended amount (2 mg/cm(2)) rather than the amount actually used (1 mg/cm(2)).

Conclusion

Under acute sun exposure conditions (a week at the beach), the cost of sun protection appears acceptable if sun protective clothing is worn and large-format bottles and low-cost sunscreens are used. Conversely, in a sun-sensitive population requiring year-round protection, the annual budget is relatively high and patients may require financial assistance to be compliant with sun protection guidelines.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^1138eq13]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Intracutaneous test solutions — controls, volumes, and starting dilutions — A positive histamine control (equivalent to 0.10 mg/mL [wt/vol] of histamine base) should be included to evaluate the degree of skin response at the time of the test. The volumes of intracutaneous test solutions may vary from 0.02 to 0.05 mL, and delivery of small volumes (< 0.03 mL) is difficult to attain with regularity. Because of the greater possibility of systemic reactions after intracutaneous testing, special care should be given to preparing less potent test dilutions; as a general rule, the starting dose of intracutaneous extract solutions in patients with a preceding negative prick test result should range from 100- to 1,000-fold dilutions of the concentrated extracts used for prick/puncture tests, and for standardized allergens the range of starting intracutaneous solutions after a negative prick/puncture test is between 10 and 100 BAU.

### Ciclopirox topical solution, 8% (nail lacquer) [^113Vg8dk]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

Systemic absorption of ciclopirox was determined in 5 patients with dermatophytic onychomycoses, after application of Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8% to all 20 digits and adjacent 5 mm of skin once daily for six months. Random serum concentrations and 24 hour urinary excretion of ciclopirox were determined at two weeks and at 1, 2, 4 and 6 months after initiation of treatment and 4 weeks post-treatment. In this study, ciclopirox serum levels ranged from 12–80 ng/mL. Based on urinary data, mean absorption of ciclopirox from the dosage form was < 5% of the applied dose. One month after cessation of treatment, serum and urine levels of ciclopirox were below the limit of detection. In human systemic tolerability studies following daily application) in subjects with distal subungual onychomycosis, the average maximal serum level of ciclopirox was 31 ± 28 ng/mL after two months of once daily applications.

This level was 159 times lower than the lowest toxic dose and 115 times lower than the highest nontoxic dose in rats and dogs fed 7. 7 and
23. 1 mg ciclopirox /kg/day. If possible, Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8% should be applied to the nail bed, hyponychium, and the under surface of the nail plate when it is free of the nail bed. Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8% should not be removed on a daily basis. Daily applications should be made over the previous coat and removed with alcohol every seven days. This cycle should be repeated throughout the duration of therapy.

### Conventional topical delivery systems [^1162yvF8]. Dermatologic Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Effective dermatologic therapy depends on both the active drug and the properties of the delivery system. A topical delivery system, or vehicle, is defined as the substance that carries a specific drug into contact with and through the skin. The challenge to topical drug delivery is the transport across the skin barrier. Depending on the delivery system, penetration of the active drug can be quite variable and this is largely due to the physiochemical properties of the constituent components of that vehicle. Selection of the appropriate drug delivery system will depend on the active, anatomic site of disease and patient preferences.

### Topical corticosteroid vehicle composition and implications for clinical practice [^113Sv6kj]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

This narrative review highlights the therapeutic significance of topical corticosteroid (TCS) vehicles and provides subsequent guidance to improve clinical and research outcomes. A greater understanding of the relationship between the topical vehicle, corticosteroid and skin is needed to ensure safer, more effective treatment for patients. Topical vehicles are not inert and can affect TCS bioavailability, due to the ability of their composition to positively or negatively influence skin status and change the physiochemical characteristics of an inherent corticosteroid. However, this principle is not commonly understood, and has contributed to inconsistencies in potency classification systems. This review provides an insight into the research methods and standardization needed to determine TCS product bioavailability. It identifies formulation components responsible for vehicle composition that underpin the quality, stability, compounding and functionalities of vehicle ingredients. This helps to contextualize how topical vehicles can be responsible for clinically significant effects, and how their composition gives products unique properties. In turn, this facilitates a more in-depth understanding of which resources offer information to inform the best selection of TCS products and why products should be prescribed by brand or manufacturer. This review will better equip clinicians and formulary teams to appraise products. It will also inform prescribing of Specials and why products should not be manipulated. The recommendations, accompanied by patient perspectives on using TCS products, assist clinical decision-making. They also identify the need for research into concomitant application of TCS products with other topical therapies.

Pain is a leading reason for seeking medical care, necessitating accurate diagnosis and appropriate analgesic treatment. When oral administration is impractical due to nausea, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, or gastrointestinal issues, or when pain is localized, topical analgesics offer an effective alternative for managing both acute and chronic pain conditions, including osteoarthritis and neuropathic pain. These agents, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, lidocaine, and capsaicin, can provide pain relief while minimizing systemic side effects. Technological advances, such as nanocarriers and microneedles, aim to improve efficacy but face challenges like cost and toxicity. Here, the authors explore the pharmacology and clinical efficacy of topical analgesics, providing recommendations for their use in pain management.

### Approximate weight of 1: 1000 topical epinephrine on wrung-out epinephrine-soaked pledgets [^116Ej94T]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Topical 1:1000 epinephrine solution is commonly applied intranasally with cottonoid pledgets in endoscopic sinonasal surgery for local vasoconstriction and hemostasis. Pledgets are typically submerged in epinephrine solution and applied without measurement. Hemodynamic complications have been reported when pledgets have been saturated and not wrung out. The amount of epinephrine absorbed per pledget has not been studied methodically. The purpose of this study was to determine the amount of topical 1:1000 epinephrine remaining on a cottonoid pledget after wringing out the pledget, to simulate intraoperative application.

Study Design

Cohort study.

Setting

Tertiary care center.

Subjects and Methods

Sixty 0.5-in × 3-in cottonoid pledgets were submerged in canisters filled with 1:1000 epinephrine solution (1 mg/mL). Weights of the epinephrine-filled canisters were measured before submerging the pledgets and then after removing and wringing out the pledgets. Measurements were recorded for each pledget after being submerged for 0, 1, and 5 minutes and then wrung out. Mean weights were calculated and compared between the submersion durations.

Results

The mean overall weight of epinephrine on a wrung-out pledget was 0.931 mg. Mean weights of epinephrine absorbed onto wrung-out pledgets after submersion for 0, 1, and 5 minutes were 0.914, 0.913, and 0.967 mg, respectively. There were no significant differences in weights based on submersion duration (P = .296).

Conclusion

Approximately 1 mg of epinephrine was absorbed onto 0.5-in × 3-in cottonoid pledgets when pledgets were wrung out after being submerged in 1:1000 epinephrine, whether being removed from solution immediately or after up to 5 minutes.

### Serum concentrations and pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid after two means of topical administration in massive weight loss skin-reducing surgery [^116QKesC]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Interventions

Age, sex, height, body weight, body mass index, serum creatinine concentration, and estimated glomerular filtration rate were registered for all participants. The weight of the resected tissue was registered for the abdominoplasty groups and the maximum width and length of the wound were measured to allow calculation of an elliptical wound surface area (in square centimeters) as π × (length/2) × (width/2).

In the topical moistening group, the wound surface was moistened with 20 mL of tranexamic acid 25 mg/ml (total dose, 500 mg) after completion of hemostasis and directly before wound closure, with no further swabbing of the wound. Drains were activated after completion of the wound closure, which was at least 45 minutes after tranexamic acid application. The dose of 500 mg is half of that given in the other two groups. However, 20 mL is enough to moisten even larger surfaces, and doubling the volume would only cause more spill without increasing the absorbed dose. Doubling the concentration was not done, as potential local toxic effects of 50 mg/ml are not yet clarified, and 25 mg/ml has proven efficient. In the topical bolus group, 200 mL of tranexamic acid 5 mg/ml (total dose, 1 g) was instilled into the wound cavity by means of the drains after wound closure. Drains were clamped for 1 hour thereafter. In the intravenous bolus group, 1 g tranexamic acid diluted in 100 mg 0.9% sodium chloride was administered intravenous immediately before surgery.

Blood samples for the analysis of tranexamic acid were obtained before drug administration, and after 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, and 6 hours. The intravenous bolus group also had a sample taken at 5 minutes, whereas the two topical groups had an additional sample taken the next morning. In the topical bolus group, the last eight patients had an additional sample obtained after 8 hours, as early analyses suggested that the peak serum concentration of tranexamic acid in this group could take place later than 6 hours. All blood samples were centrifuged at 2000 relative centrifugal force for 10 minutes within 15 to 30 minutes after sampling. Thereafter, serum was pipetted off, transferred to polypropylene tubes, and stored at −80°C until analysis.

SULCONAZOLE NITRATE topical solution 1. 0% is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent indicated for the treatment of tinea cruris and tinea corporis caused by Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Epidermophyton floccosum, and Microsporum canis; and for the treatment of tinea versicolor. Effectiveness has not been proven in tinea pedis. Clinical studies of SULCONAZOLE NITRATE topical solution 1.

0%, did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. There were no systemic effects and only infrequent cutaneous adverse reactions in 370 patients treated with sulconazole nitrate solution in controlled clinical trials. Approximately 1% of these patients reported itching and 1% burning or stinging. These complaints did not usually interfere with treatment. A small amount of solution should be gently massaged into the affected and surrounding skin areas once or twice daily. Symptomatic relief usually occurs within a few days after starting SULCONAZOLE NITRATE topical solution 1. 0%, and clinical improvement usually occurs within 1 week. To reduce the possibility of recurrence, tinea cruris, tinea corporis, and tinea versicolor should be treated for 3 weeks.

If significant clinical improvement is not seen after 4 weeks of treatment, an alternate diagnosis should be considered. SULCONAZOLE NITRATE topical solution 1. 0% is a clear, slightly viscous, colorless to slightly yellow liquid with a slight characteristic odor. It is supplied as follows: 30 mL plastic bottle – NDC 72143–321–30.

### Care of the patient with primary open-angle glaucoma [^113n1qVh]. AOA (2010). Medium credibility.

Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) medical treatment — topical therapy principles — notes that medical treatment is generally used initially for most forms of POAG and that topical treatment is minimally invasive; however, only 1–7% of the instilled drug reaches the ocular anterior chamber. Start with the medication that provides the least patient risk and most efficacious treatment, considering ocular and systemic side effects, costs, patient preferences and dosage inconvenience. Prostaglandin analogs (PGAs) have been found to provide the best IOP-lowering among all the monotherapy topical drugs, and combining a PGA and another category of topical drug further enhances IOP decrease. Drugs within a glaucoma medication class share similar mechanisms of action and efficacy, and therefore generally can be expected to result in similar IOP reduction; it is usually best to change class or add a medication of a different class to improve therapy, and switching within a class, however, may minimize systemic or local adverse reactions. Combining glaucoma medications (e.g., adding a second and perhaps third drop) to the treatment regimen, usually from different classes, may be beneficial to patients who require a lower intraocular pressure (IOP), but use as few medications as reasonable to decrease toxicity and compliance complexity. If more than one drug is to be topically applied, educate patients to allow time in between drops of at least three to five minutes to allow for proper absorption, and educate patients to avoid touching the bottle tip to the eyes or face, to place just one drop into the inferior cul de sac, and to employ lid and/or nasolacrimal duct closure to enhance drug effectivity while minimizing systemic absorption.

### A preliminary report of the biochemical and clinical effects of 1, 4-diaminobutane on prevention of human hypertrophic scars [^115HdXQx]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective evidence for the role of inhibition of collagen cross-linking in human scar using a nontoxic topical inhibitor, 1,4-diaminobutane (1,4 DAB), in patients with scars at risk for hypertrophic scar formation is presented. The authors used a concentration of 1,4 DAB of 0.8% (weight/volume) in a cream base similar to Glaxal Base. Application was once per day at night. The control was treated with cream base alone. In treatment phase studies at 2 months, tissue biopsies were performed and used to determine a therapeutic effect biochemically in paired scars harvested chosen with typical hypertrophic scars at two major treatment centers. Tissue transglutaminase activity revealed a significant reduction of the ε-(γ-glutamyl)lysine cross-links in the treated scars: 7.96 ± 1.51 pmol/µmol amino acid versus 14.78 ± 3.52 pmol/µmol amino acid. A subset of paired scars (n = 15) was also analyzed for soluble procollagen type III amino propeptide. The effect was a significant increase in procollagen type III amino propeptide in the scars treated with 1,4 DAB compared with sham-treated scars: 47.75 ± 4.6 µg/mg wet weight versus 39.08 ± 6.02 µg/mg wet weight, respectively. Levels of tissue 1,4 DAB was found to be twice as high in the presence of the active cream versus in the tissue of the control group. In subsequent prophylaxis studies, the authors treated 44 breast reduction patients prospectively with active cream to one or the other side in a double-blind randomized fashion. Hardness (in grams) measured using a Rex Durometer at 6 and 12 weeks postoperatively along with photographs were analyzed. The mean value ± SD of 24.98 ± 1.2 g on the active side versus 31.76 ± 1.1 g on the sham side was significantly different (p < 0.05). The patient scale scores of the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale were also requested by survey in a responding 27-patient subgroup at a minimum 1 year postoperatively, and the differences between the two sides were found to be statistically significant, where the mean on the active side was 14.07 ± 1.34 and the mean on the sham side was 21.41 ± 1 (p < 0.05). The results are evidence to support the use of this agent in prevention of hypertrophic scars. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:: Therapeutic, II.

### Principles of topical treatment: advancement in gel vehicle technology [^111bF2eg]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Topical treatment is a pillar of dermatologic practice. The delivery of drug by a topical vehicle is dependent on complex physical chemistry and on how well patients apply the product. The potency of topical agents is not solely dependent on the concentration of active drug in the vehicle. A corticosteroid molecule may have vastly different potency depending on what vehicle is used to deliver it. Similarly, a new gel vehicle is able to deliver considerably more active antifungal than an older vehicle technology and may represent a promising vehicle for other novel formulations. The use of new vehicles can provide more effective means for treating patients with skin disease.

Test solutions were kept at room temperature and topically applied to the eyelid skin and margins using an absorbent cotton gauze square (0.4 g rectangle (50 mm × 60 mm), CS-being, Daisan Cotton, Japan). A loading volume of 0.5 mL of solution was used to wet the cotton and the square wiped twice across the closed eyelids (Fig. 5c). The off-loaded volume from the gauze was estimated by weighing the square before and after wiping and found to be 6.5 mg or 6.5 μL. For the C3 solution this is equivalent to 13 μg of C3 for both eyes. This method of delivery targets the edges of the closed eyelids and utilizes the eyelashes as a wick to distribute the solution to the mucocutaneous junctions, conjunctiva, and precorneal film. The lid wiper mechanism of the blink further evenly distributes the solution on to the ocular surface. By using this wiping method, bolus delivery of an eye drop to the corneal surface is avoided.

### Topical capsaicin for pain management: therapeutic potential and mechanisms of action of the new high-concentration capsaicin 8% patch [^113UvSyf]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Site of action and pharmacokinetics

There is no evidence that topical capsaicin works through a transdermal systemic delivery into tissues other than the skin. Indeed, capsaicin is a very lipophilic, non-water-soluble compound and resists diffusion into aqueous solutions such as blood, and shows limited potential for transdermal delivery across human skin. Even when capsaicin is absorbed systemically, the duration of exposure is very short. The oral bioavailability of capsaicin was recently reported in humans: after ingestion of 26.6 mg of capsaicin, the pharmacokinetic parameters were a C max of 2.5 (0.1) ng mL −1, T max of 47.1 (2.0) min, and T 1/2 of 24.9 (5.0) min. There are no published data from low-concentration formulations, but after 60 or 90 min capsaicin 8% patch treatments for painful peripheral neuropathy, plasma concentrations were also very low (with a population C max of 1.86 ng mL −1) and transient (mean elimination half-life of 1.64 h). The longer elimination half-life of topical capsaicin relative to oral exposure is likely to reflect its slow release from the skin at the patch application site. Capsaicin is metabolized rapidly by several cytochrome (CYP) enzymes present in the human liver, but in vitro studies show that its metabolism in human skin is quite slow. The implication for topical capsaicin-containing analgesics is that capsaicin can reside at the site of action (i.e. skin) relatively unchanged, whereas any capsaicin which is transdermally absorbed is rapidly eliminated.

### Podofilox [^111j73cp]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The prescriber should ensure that the patient is fully aware of the correct method of therapy and identify which specific warts should be treated.

Apply twice daily for 3 consecutive days, then discontinue for 4 consecutive days. This one-week cycle of treatment may be repeated until there is no visible wart tissue or for a maximum of four cycles. If there is incomplete response after four treatment cycles, discontinue treatment and consider alternative treatment. Safety and effectiveness of more than four treatment cycles has not been established. There is no evidence to suggest that more frequent application will increase efficacy, but additional applications would be expected to increase the rate of local adverse reactions and systemic absorption.

Podofilox gel should be applied to the warts with the applicator tip or finger. Application on the surrounding normal tissue should be minimized. Treatment should be limited to 10 cm or less of wart tissue and to no more than 0.5 gram of the gel per day.

Care should be taken to allow the gel to dry before allowing the return of opposing skin surfaces to their normal positions. Patients should be instructed to wash their hands thoroughly before and after each application.

### Pooled results of two randomized phase III trials evaluating VP-102, a drug-device combination product containing cantharidin 0.7% (w / V) for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum [^113XFinN]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

VP-102 is a shelf-stable, proprietary drug–device combination product containing cantharidin (0.7% weight/volume [w/v]) and the inactive ingredients acetone, gentian violet, and denatonium benzoate in a film-forming topical solution. The applicator device containing the solution is composed of a glass ampule containing 450 µL of solution within a single-use applicator device that allows for a stable concentration of solution, along with a filter and precision (1 mm) applicator tip opening that allows for topical application of the solution to treatable molluscum lesions by a healthcare professional. The applicator allows for shelf stability, consistent formulation of the solution, and precise application to affected skin. Once applied, the acetone evaporates quickly, leaving a thin dry film that is then washed off within roughly 24 h. Gentian violet is a surgical dye inside the film that allows for distinction between treated and untreated lesions during application. Denatonium benzoate, one of the most bitter agents on the planet, is included to deter oral ingestion.

We present pooled analyses of two large vehicle-controlled phase III clinical trials, CAMP (Cantharidin Application in Molluscum Patients)-1 and -2, that were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VP-102 compared with vehicle in participants aged ≥ 2 years with molluscum. In addition, pooling data from these two large-scale phase III trials allows for a reduction in the variability seen in individual trials and may assist healthcare professionals make decisions about treatments and set expectations of safety and efficacy for their patients.

### Not all topical corticosteroids are created equal! optimizing therapeutic outcomes through better understanding of vehicle formulations, compound selection, and methods of application [^115GUQfy]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Since the first successful topical glucocorticosteroid, compound F, was applied to human skin to treat eczematous dermatitis approximately 60 years ago, several advances have been made in the development of topical corticosteroid (TC) compounds and vehicle formulations. The ability to apply a TC and improve skin disease revolutionized dermatologic therapy and has proven to be one of the biggest advances in the history of dermatology. The potency of a TC and their vehicle formulation can vary among brand and generic TC compounds, which can sometimes confound the clinical situation as one brand or generic formulation of a TC may be well tolerated while another generic formulation induced skin irritation or allergenicity in a patient who previously encountered no difficulties.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^114XxqkB]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

Appendix B — Transdermal agents (gels and solutions) report that transdermal testosterone shows systemic absorption rates ranging from 13–20%, and use of an occlusive dressing can increase absorption by approximately 2.5 fold; after application, steady state levels are achieved within 24–72 hours with testosterone levels returning to baseline within 4 days of discontinuation. Liquids and gels should be applied to clean, dry skin, and the treatment site should not be washed until the time of next application to optimize delivery; if insufficient testosterone levels are achieved with one topical agent, substitution with another topical agent is a viable treatment strategy. Topical liquid and gel formulations are able to achieve testosterone levels in the normal range in 74–87% of men, and there is no consistent data at this time that demonstrate that one agent achieves higher serum levels than others. Adverse effects include application site reactions (3–16% erythema or rash) and risk of transference; patients should be particularly cautioned against contact with women and children after application, and transference may be mitigated by washing hands, covering the application site with clothing, and washing the region prior to anticipated direct contact with others.

### Microtoxin for improving pore size, skin laxity, sebum control, and scars: a roundtable on integrating intradermal botulinum toxin type A microdoses into clinical practice [^116BCcfT]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

A straightforward method for preparing 3 different dilutions for different applications, described by W.W. in 2015 and in a subsequent 2017 publication, is summarized below and in Table 1 :,

Begin with a standard vial of BoNT-A at a concentration of 100 U in 2.5 mL saline (40 U/mL).
In a 1-mL syringe, draw up either 0.5 mL (20 U), 0.6 mL (24 U), or 0.7 mL (28 U), depending on the final concentration needed.
An appropriate amount of saline or lidocaine is then added to this syringe to bring the volume to 1 mL.

Table 1.
Overview of Microtoxin Dilutions for Different Aesthetic Concerns

Following preparation of the skin with 5% topical lidocaine for 20 minutes (which is subsequently rinsed off), microtoxin can be administered with a 1-mL syringe and a 1-inch, 32- or 34-gauge needle. For the face, microdroplets can range in size from ∼0.01 to 0.05 mL placed in a 1-cm 2 grid pattern or closer. Each microdroplet on the neck amounts to ∼0.01 mL and can be placed in a 1-cm 2 grid pattern. The needle should be inserted as superficially as possible, and there should be some resistance as the injector pushes the plunger for a very short period. Practice is needed for consistent delivery of microdroplets, and the appearance of small blebs under the skin with some blanching are an indicator that the injection is in the right plane and that delivery of the BoNT-A is consistent. Changing needles in the middle of the procedure can improve patient comfort. An injection is shown in the Video.

Duration of Treatment

Treatment effect begins at 1 week and is apparent by 4 weeks. The durability of microtoxin is about 3 months, and the ideal time for retreatment is 2 to 3 months for most patients. Although this necessitates relatively frequent treatment, the treatment does well in addressing multiple aspects of global appearance and is both an accessible treatment for patients and one that requires no additional equipment for the injector. It should be noted that duration can be far longer for some patients (Figure 4), but this is more the exception than the rule. In the authors' experience, duration is related to the activity and strength of the underlying muscles.

### Topical analgesics: pharmacology and clinical applications [^116CjZuL]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Technological Improvements of Topical Analgesic Delivery

As we have discussed, a fraction of the administered dose of topical analgesics can be absorbed into the systemic circulation, potentially increasing the risk of adverse effects that topical application aims to avoid. Although systemic concentrations are typically low, it is essential to optimize the application of topical drugs. This ensures effective penetration through the stratum corneum while maintaining localized action and minimizing entry into the bloodstream. There are several technological improvements that may help to improve skin penetration. These include nanocarriers, such as liposomes, nanoemulsions, and lipid nanoparticles, but also other carriers, such as microsponges, ionic liquids, and deep eutectic solvents. They can be combined with active application modes, such as radiation or microneedle injections. These innovative formulation strategies may improve drug transport and pharmacokinetics of topical analgesics.

For instance, a diclofenac microemulsion was tested in a small prospective observational study with 11 patients, of whom 9 reported at least a 50% reduction in pain on a visual analog scale. While these results are promising, the small cohort size limits the ability to draw definitive conclusions about the efficacy of the diclofenac microemulsion.

Despite their potential, these technological advancements also have certain disadvantages, including high material and production costs as well as the risk of potential toxicity. Additionally, delivery and targeted release of large molecules, such as peptides and proteins without systemic uptake, remain a challenge with these methods. In the context of personalized medicine, it may also be necessary to tailor delivery strategies and doses to the patient's specific skin type and unique requirements.

In summary, numerous novel and promising topical drug delivery systems have been developed that could be useful for the delivery of analgesics. However, further research is needed to establish their efficacy and safety.

Pain management is a complex process that requires careful selection of analgesics and their routes of administration to address both acute and chronic conditions effectively. Topical analgesics offer promising alternatives to oral medications for acute, inflammatory, and neuropathic pain, particularly for patients with gastrointestinal issues or those at risk of systemic side effects. Further research into innovative delivery systems is crucial to optimize their use and to improve safety and efficacy.

### Diclofenac sodium, isopropyl alcohol (vennGel one) [^115QzSmU]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The dose for your hands, wrists, or elbows is 2 grams of diclofenac sodium topical gel each time you apply it.

Apply diclofenac sodium topical gel 4 times a day (a total of 8 grams each day).

Do not apply more than 8 grams each day to any one of your affected hands, wrists, or elbows.

The dose for your feet, ankles, or knees is 4 grams of diclofenac sodium topical gel each time you apply it.

Apply diclofenac sodium topical gel 4 times a day (a total of 16 grams each day).

Do not apply more than 16 grams each day to any one of your affected feet, ankles, or knees.

Some examples of diclofenac sodium topical gel application include:

If you use 2 grams of diclofenac sodium topical gel on one hand, 4 times a day, your total dose for one day is 8 grams.
If you use 4 grams of diclofenac sodium topical gel on one knee, 4 times a day, your total dose for one day is 16 grams.
Your total dose for one day, treating one hand and one knee, is 8 grams plus 16 grams, which equals 24 grams of diclofenac sodium topical gel.

Before you use a new tube of diclofenac sodium topical gel for the first time, open the foil seal that covers the tube opening by using the spiked top of the cap. Remember to remove the dosing card from the carton to measure your dose (see Figure A).
Apply diclofenac sodium topical gel to clean, dry skin that does not have any cuts, open wounds, infections, or rashes.
Do not use heating pads or apply bandages to where you have applied diclofenac sodium topical gel.
Avoid exposing skin where you apply diclofenac sodium topical gel to sunlight and artificial light, such as tanning booths.
Do not use sunscreens, cosmetics, lotions, moisturizers, insect repellants, or other topical medicines on the same skin areas where you have applied diclofenac sodium topical gel.
Do not get diclofenac sodium topical gel in your eyes, nose, or mouth. Diclofenac sodium topical gel is only to be used on your skin (topical use). If you get diclofenac sodium topical gel in your eyes, rinse your eyes right away with water or saline. Talk with your healthcare provider if eye irritation lasts for more than one hour.

### Serum concentrations and pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid after two means of topical administration in massive weight loss skin-reducing surgery [^113CA1Yc]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Topical application of tranexamic acid can provide adequate concentrations in the wound with a low systemic concentration and thus lessen the risk of systemic adverse events. Topical application is receiving increasing attention, as it is inexpensive and simple, and may reduce bleeding from all surgical surfaces. Large studies from joint replacement surgery have confirmed that topical use of tranexamic acid reduces blood loss at least as well as intravenous administration. – Studies from cardiac and thoracic surgery are fewer, smaller, and not unambiguous. – Studies on topical use of tranexamic acid from other surgical areas have so far been scarce. –

Topical use of tranexamic acid in surgery consists mostly of administration as a bolus into a confined space or by adding it to the irrigation fluid. Moistening a wound surface can be performed with a small volume with a high drug concentration, whereas irrigation or local bolus administration needs larger volumes with lower drug concentrations. The lowest tranexamic acid concentration that can be administered in a solution and still have a topical hemostatic effect is unknown, but concentrations below 5 mg/ml have been shown to be effective. In oral and dental surgery, a high-concentration mouthwash (48 mg/ml) has been reported but is not commercially available. Only a few studies have measured systemic tranexamic acid concentrations after topical use in surgery, and then mostly at a single time point, rendering peak levels uncertain and precluding a complete pharmacokinetic analysis.,

The aim of this study was to investigate the degree of systemic absorption after two means of topical routine prophylactic application in patients having large wound surface areas: (1) moistening the wound surface before closure with 20 mL of tranexamic acid 25 mg/ml, or (2) instilling a bolus of 200 mL tranexamic acid 5 mg/ml into the wound cavity retrogradely by means of drains after closure. We also compared the systemic tranexamic acid concentrations achieved by these two methods with standard intravenous prophylactic administration of 1 g of tranexamic acid in hip replacement surgery.

### Topical application of tranexamic acid reduces postoperative blood loss in total knee arthroplasty: a randomized, controlled trial [^113F2j96]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Topical application of tranexamic acid to bleeding wound surfaces reduces blood loss in patients undergoing some major surgeries, without systemic complications. The objective of the present trial was to assess the efficacy and safety of the topical application of tranexamic acid on postoperative blood loss in patients undergoing primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty with cement.

Methods

In a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 124 patients were randomized to receive 1.5 or 3.0 g of tranexamic acid in 100 mL of normal saline solution or an equivalent volume of placebo (normal saline solution) applied into the joint for five minutes at the end of surgery. The primary outcome was blood loss calculated from the difference between the preoperative hemoglobin level and the corresponding lowest postoperative value or hemoglobin level prior to transfusion. The safety outcomes included Doppler ultrasound in all patients and measurement of plasma levels of tranexamic acid one hour after release of the tourniquet.

Results

Twenty-five patients were withdrawn for various reasons; therefore, ninety-nine patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The postoperative blood loss was reduced in the 1.5 and 3-g tranexamic acid groups (1295 mL [95% confidence interval, 1167 to 1422 mL] and 1208 mL [95% confidence interval, 1078 to 1339 mL], respectively) in comparison with the placebo group (1610 mL [95% confidence interval, 1480 to 1738 mL]) (p < 0.017). The postoperative hemoglobin levels were higher in the 1.5 and 3.0-g tranexamic acid groups (10.0 g/dL [95% confidence interval, 9.5 to 10.4 g/dL] and 10.1 g/dL [95% confidence interval, 9.8 to 10.5 g/dL], respectively) in comparison with the placebo group (8.6 g/dL [95% confidence interval, 8.2 to 9 g/dL]) (p < 0.017). With the numbers studied, there was no difference in the rates of deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism between the three groups. Minimal systemic absorption of tranexamic acid was observed.

Conclusions

At the conclusion of a total knee arthroplasty with cement, topical application of tranexamic acid directly into the surgical wound reduced postoperative bleeding by 20% to 25%, or 300 to 400 mL, resulting in 16% to 17% higher postoperative hemoglobin levels compared with placebo, with no clinically important increase in complications being identified in the treatment groups.

### A prospective study of patient adherence to topical treatments: 95% of patients underdose [^112MWyFu]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Adherence is essential to a positive treatment outcome. Whether adequate doses of topically applied drugs are used among patients with dermatologic conditions has not been investigated adequately.

Objectives

The objective of this prospective study was to determine to what extent first-time outpatients with dermatologic conditions apply the appropriate dosage of initial treatment with topically administered medication.

Methods

Consultations with first-time patients in the dermatologic outpatient clinic were observed. Patients receiving a prescription for a previously untried topically administered drug were eligible. The expected quantity of topical treatment to be used by each patient was calculated from the affected skin area to be treated. The affected area was estimated in numbers of palms of the hand, and an amount of 0.25 g of ointment or cream was chosen as sufficient treatment to cover the area of one palm. Two weeks after the consultation, a questionnaire with items regarding the size of the affected area, intentions to follow the treatment, and the applied dose the previous day was mailed to each patient. The questionnaires were personally collected from the patients' homes and at the same visit the patients' topical drug containers were weighed on a balance. Both patients and staff were blinded to the particular study purpose concerning adherence and dosing.

Results

In all, 17 patients were eligible. The majority received a prescription for topical corticosteroids, and the median area to be treated was 3 palms of the hand (interquartile range: 1.5–8). Two patients did not redeem their prescriptions. Only one patient used the expected dosage; in general median 35% (interquartile range: 22%-50%) of the expected individual dosages were used.

Limitations

Only first-time patients who received a new and previously untried topical treatment were included, resulting in a small study size.

Conclusions

Most first-time patients with dermatologic conditions underdose new topical treatments. Consequently, clinicians should always consider nonadherence when topical therapies fail.

### A unimolecule nanopesticide delivery system applied in field scale for enhanced pest control [^1167Mqmd]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Toxicity assessments in non-target organism

Adult zebrafish (D. rerio, AB strain) were randomly selected with an equal sex ratio and distributed in 1-L beakers with 1 L of sample in a gradient dilution. There were 10 fish in each treatment group. Water was used as the control treatment. The number of dead fish in each tank was recorded after 96 h. Fish were classified as dead if they were not breathing or did not move when the tail was touched. The mortality rate and LC 50 were calculated by probit regression analysis. A typical method for toxicity assessments in bee (Topical application): Preparing solutions with methanol at five concentrations (such as 0.50, 1.00, 2.00, 4.00, and 8.00 mg·L −1). Bees are introduced into an Erlenmeyer flask, which is sealed with gauze, and anesthetized with nitrogen gas. Using an electric pipette, 1.00 μL of the test solution at each concentration is applied to the dorsal thorax of each bee. A methanol control group (CK) is also set up. Both the treatment and control groups are conducted with 3 replicates, each containing 10 bees. Once the bees have dried, they are transferred to test cages and fed with 50% (w/w) sucrose solution. The mortality rate and LD 50 were calculated by probit regression analysis. A typical method for toxicity assessments in bee (Oral feeding): Pesticides are diluted with a 50% (mass concentration) sucrose solution to five concentrations (such as 0.0625, 0.125, 0.250, 0.500, and 1.00 mg·L −1) sucrose solutions. Bees from the storage cage are transferred to the test cage, and 200 μL of the sucrose solution containing the test substance is added to the feeder, with a blank control group set up. Both the treatment and control groups are replicated 3 times, each with 10 bees. Since the bees refused to feed, resulting in low food consumption, the feeders are removed after 6 h and replaced with pesticide-free sucrose solution for ad libitum feeding. At the same time, the consumption of each group's solution is measured by determining the weight of the remaining food. The mortality rate and LD 50 were calculated by probit regression analysis. A typical method for toxicity assessments in earthworm: Pesticide solutions were prepared at five different concentrations (such as 500, 250, 125, 62.5, and 31.25 mg·L −1). The healthy earthworms were introduced into culture dishes, and then the prepared pesticide solutions were added with 1 mL per dish. Both the treatment and control groups are conducted with 3 replicates. A water control group (CK) is also set up. The mortality rate of the earthworms for pesticide treatment was assessed after 1 day. The mortality rate and LC 50 were calculated by probit regression analysis.

### Randomized clinical trial of topical tranexamic acid after reduction mammoplasty [^116d5GHZ]. The British Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

When fibrinolysis exceeds coagulation, unwanted surgical bleeding may occur despite adequate haemostasis. Tranexamic acid is the most commonly used medication to prevent fibrinolysis. It acts by blocking the lysine-binding sites on plasminogen, thereby preventing the activation of plasminogen to plasmin. Tranexamic acid can be administered orally or intravenously, but topical use is being reported increasingly.

Intravenous administration of tranexamic acid during major surgery has been shown to reduce the need for blood transfusion by 32–37 per cent, as well as measurable postoperative bleeding by 34 per cent. The dose has varied considerably, from 1 to 20 g administered intravenously over 20 min to 12 h. Suggested single intravenous doses are 1–2 g. The minimal effective plasma concentration is unknown. Safety concerns have included thrombosis, renal impairment, and increased risk of seizures associated with high doses (above 2 g). Definitive causal relationships have not been established, but, as adverse effects may be dose-related, and doses above 1–2 g seem to provide no added benefit, high-dose intravenous administration is discouraged. Because of uncertainty about the effect of tranexamic acid, particularly on vascular occlusive events, it is still not recommended for routine use during most surgical procedures.

Topical application of tranexamic acid provides a high drug concentration at the site of the wound and a low systemic concentration. Studies from cardiac and orthopaedic surgery have shown an equal or superior effect of topical compared with intravenous tranexamic acid on both bleeding and transfusion requirement–. Topical treatment is cost-effective, and adverse effects or drug interactions have not been reported.

In previous studies, topical tranexamic acid was instilled mainly as a bolus into confined spaces such as a joint, the mediastinum or the pericardium, or applied to accessible wounds using soaked gauze–. A few studies–have described simple moistening of a wound surface. Whereas most topical haemostatic agents can cover only a small surface area, tranexamic acid diluted in saline can moisten large areas, such as after massive weight loss surgery, or in patients with burns.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether moistening a wound surface with tranexamic acid reduces bleeding. This hypothesis was tested in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study of women undergoing bilateral reduction mammoplasty, where effects of intervention on one breast can be evaluated by comparison with the other.

### Serum concentrations and pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid after two means of topical administration in massive weight loss skin-reducing surgery [^111iN6vS]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study demonstrates that moistening a large wound surface with a 25-mg/ml tranexamic acid solution, or instilling a bolus of 200 mL tranexamic acid 5 mg/ml into a large wound cavity, results in very low serum tranexamic acid levels compared to an intravenous bolus of 1 g of tranexamic acid. The mode of administration clearly accounts for the differences between the intravenous bolus group and the two topical groups. Although patients in the intravenous bolus group were on average 20 years older than those in the topical groups and had significantly lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, group interdiversity should not influence the general descriptive observations of this study.

The tranexamic acid concentration needed to inhibit fibrinolysis in vitro starts at approximately 10 µg/ml in adults and approximately 5 µg/ml in children. Fibrinolysis is inhibited by more than 90 percent at tranexamic acid concentrations of approximately 20 µg/ml, and a concentration of 100 µg/ml provides a 98 percent inhibition. In our study, topical application gave a mean peak serum concentration of 4.9 µg/ml in the bolus group and 5.2 µg/ml in the moistening group. The systemic antifibrinolytic effect should therefore be negligible. It would therefore appear safe to use these topical methods also in patients with increased risk of thromboembolic eventsor at the donor sites for free flaps. However, we have not found any published studies on the effect of topical application directly onto microvascular anastomoses, and we have personally not used topical tranexamic acid at recipient sites.

### Topical anesthetic creams [^115RxDQ1]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Topical anesthetic creams have positive applications in plastic surgery. For certain procedures, they can replace injected local anesthetics. By replacing injections with a topical cream, the negative effects associated with injections, such as pain, needle anxiety, and edema at the surgical site, are eliminated. A variety of U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved topical anesthetic creams are available for use; however, much care must be taken when prescribing and administering these drugs, as anesthetic creams compounded in nonstandard doses can result in severe toxicity and death. When used appropriately, topical anesthetic creams can provide a safe and effective alternative to other forms of anesthesia.

### Enhancing outcomes in seborrheic keratosis: using a novel treatment solution [^112Wv4tX]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Seborrheic keratosis (SK) is an extremely common benign cutaneous lesion that often appears on individuals older than the age of 50. SK lesions can appear in numerous clinical variations, but typically, SKs present with a well-demarcated, "stuck-on" appearance having a waxy or keratotic surface. Even though SK lesions are usually benign, many individuals elect for SK treatment or removal due to cosmetic concerns. One study regarding SK appearance reported that 61% of women tried to conceal the appearance of the SKs by using certain hairstyles, make-up, and clothes. Conventional treatment for SK lesions ranges from cryosurgery to curettage. Although these removal methods are effective for SK treatment, each method contains a potential for side effects such as pigmentation changes, scarring, and discomfort before and after the procedure. Due to many of these concerns, patients prefer topical treatments for SKs, which has led to a new emerging topical containing hydrogen peroxide topical solution 40% (HP40; Eskata™). Here, we report the methods and results from an HP40 treatment for two individuals, each over 70 years old. Application of the topical solution was performed on each target SK, up to four times, with a 20-second application and 1 minute between applications. The two participants reported moderate success of HP40 in the removal of their SKs with minimal adverse effects.

### Topical analgesics: pharmacology and clinical applications [^113w5Aa7]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Due to its safety profile and favorable risk-to-benefit ratio, topical lidocaine could be an excellent alternative on its own or as an addition to systemic medications and nonpharmacologic approaches for optimized pain management and multimodal analgesia. However, more evidence is needed to support its analgesic efficacy. Like capsaicin, there is a growing need for more randomized controlled trials with larger patient cohorts to evaluate the analgesic potential of high-concentration topical lidocaine in various chronic and neuropathic pain conditions. In the management of cancer pain, topical lidocaine can be used as a coanalgesic in the form of either high-dose patches or low-dose local anesthetic creams. However, similar to capsaicin, topical lidocaine is not recommended as main analgesic for the treatment of nonneuropathic cancer pain, as opioids remain the most effective analgesics for this specific type of pain.

### Atopic dermatitis (eczema) guidelines: 2023 American academy of allergy, asthma and immunology / American college of allergy, asthma and immunology joint task force on practice parameters GRADE-and institute of medicine-based recommendations [^112woGMX]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Topical calcineurin inhibitor (TCI) safety and acceptability — evidence states there was "no credible increase in cancer" with typical TCI use across infants, children, and adults, and that "minor harms of TCIs include local irritation/burning"; willingness to use on a scale of 1–9 was higher with counseling that the sensation signals efficacy (mean [SD] 6.9 [1.8]) than with counseling about potential sensation alone (5.3 [1.9]) or with no counseling (4.9 [1.9]); clinicians should consider that topical corticosteroids (TCS) generally come in larger dispensing sizes than TCI (eg, 454 g tubs vs 100 g tubes).
