## Question

right hamstring pain management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about right hamstring pain management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about establishing the diagnosis and severity using clinical criteria and when to image. Then, I should classify the injury pattern and determine whether nonoperative or surgical care is indicated. Next, I will lay out an evidence-based acute phase plan emphasizing pain control and early protected loading. After that, I should detail a subacute-to-functional rehabilitation pathway with eccentric loading, agility/trunk stabilization, and running progression. Finally, I need to define return-to-play criteria, consider special scenarios, and address recurrence prevention with strength asymmetry, fascicle length, and the Nordic program, making sure to flag areas where evidence is mixed and to double-check my assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic foundation. Acute hamstring strain injury typically presents with sudden posterior thigh pain during activity, reproduction of pain with stretching or activation, focal tenderness, and loss of function. This clinical triad anchors the diagnosis, though the quality of evidence for specific bedside tests is low to very low, so I should be cautious not to overinterpret individual maneuvers and rely on the composite picture instead [^1175tZrn] [^116FjA8E]. I need to ensure I document mechanism, prior injury history, and initial functional limitations, because a history of prior hamstring strain is a risk factor for recurrence and influences return-to-play planning, which I should keep in mind as I counsel on prognosis and prevention [^114zdXkz].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging threshold. Most low-grade injuries do not require acute MRI; however, I should obtain MRI for high-grade suspected tears, proximal or distal tendon involvement, avulsion injuries, failure to improve by about 2 weeks, or when precise prognosis will alter management, because MRI can delineate retraction, central tendon involvement, and musculotendinous junction extent, all of which correlate with longer rehabilitation timelines [^112zQn69]. I should double-check ultrasound use as well; while it is dynamic and useful for follow-up, ultrasound has lower sensitivity than MRI for deep proximal injuries and small tears, so if ultrasound is negative but clinical suspicion remains high, I should escalate to MRI to avoid missing a high-grade lesion [^116yPofW].

> Next, I should review injury classification to guide care. Let me think about location, severity, and mechanism: injuries occur at the proximal origin near the ischial tuberosity, the muscle belly, or the distal insertions, and severity ranges from low-grade strains to complete tears or avulsions. Mechanisms commonly include high-speed sprinting, sudden lengthening under load, or stretch-type injuries with hip flexion and knee extension, which can predict poorer outcomes and longer recovery [^116zdpSK] [^117Tvy9u]. I should confirm prognostic correlates as well, including structural injuries on MRI, greater initial pain, delayed pain-free walking, and time to first consultation beyond one week, all of which portend longer return-to-play timelines and should be discussed upfront with the patient [^112zQn69] [^111XMPbH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment modality. For most acute muscle belly strains without avulsion or marked retraction, nonoperative management is first-line and yields satisfactory outcomes. However, I need to consider surgical referral for complete proximal avulsions, particularly with greater than 2 cm retraction, multi-tendon tears, displaced bony avulsions, or chronic refractory cases with functional compromise, as operative repair in these settings is associated with improved restoration of strength and lower re-tear risk when performed acutely [^116zdpSK] [^117Tvy9u] [^117XbHut]. Let me reconsider the role of endoscopic techniques; for select chronic proximal lesions or partial tears, endoscopic repair or debridement may be appropriate after failed conservative care, but evidence remains limited and patient selection is key [^1155nciW] [^117UxXUc].

> I will now examine acute-phase priorities. Relative rest, ice, compression, and elevation help control pain and swelling. I should avoid aggressive stretching or heavy loading in the first 48 to 72 hours and emphasize protected, pain-limited activation to mitigate disuse atrophy and neuromuscular inhibition while allowing tissue repair to begin [^115CtpDo]. I need to ensure I address pain without impeding healing; NSAIDs can be used judiciously for short-term symptom relief, but given concerns that they may impair regeneration, I should prefer acetaminophen when appropriate and avoid NSAIDs in higher-risk patients or when prolonged use is anticipated [^1121Zq4P] [^115CtpDo]. For analgesia, topical NSAIDs or local modalities can be considered to limit systemic exposure, but I should tailor to patient preference and risk profile while maintaining the overarching goal of early protected loading [^115CtpDo].

> Let me first confirm the early exercise framework. Early activation in pain-limited ranges is encouraged, and within 48 to 72 hours I can introduce gentle isometrics and low-load activation. Importantly, high-strain lengthening work should be avoided in the very early phase to protect the healing tissue, which aligns with contemporary consensus on load dosing in early rehab [^112B195b]. I should also remember that eccentric loading will be critical soon after this initial window, but timing should be individualized by pain and tissue irritability, so I need to check in frequently and progress only as symptoms allow [^111uQJ1d].

> Next, I should review subacute rehabilitation building blocks. As pain subsides, I will progress to lengthening-focused eccentric strengthening using the Askling L-protocol (Extender, Diver, Glider) and Nordics, which have stronger evidence for improving time to return to play and maintaining fascicle length. Dosing of 2 to 3 sessions per week with 6 to 12 reps at intensities titrated to tolerance is reasonable and supported by guideline statements [^113CBm5F] [^112jC966]. But wait, what if the patient is an athlete with sprint demands? I should integrate terminal swing–specific loading parameters with hip in high flexion and knee-focused eccentric work to better replicate sport mechanics and mitigate late-swing injury risk, as proposed by sports performance frameworks [^116sjocn].

> I should confirm the role of progressive agility and trunk stabilization. Adding a PATS program to a comprehensive program reduces reinjury risk compared with isolated hamstring strengthening and stretching, so I will incorporate multiplanar agility drills, core stability, and trunk control exercises in a graded fashion as the athlete tolerates [^111nKTjr]. Hold on, I should verify the mechanism: deficits in lumbopelvic control may predispose to recurrent hamstring injury, so emphasizing trunk and pelvic stability during rehab plausibly addresses upstream contributors to reinjury risk, even if direct causality remains complex to prove [^113CBm5F].

> Now, I need to ensure a structured running progression. Early pain-free walking leads to straight-line jogging, then progressive acceleration/deceleration drills, and finally maximal sprinting, with progression driven by symptom criteria rather than fixed timelines. Expert consensus supports individualized running integration based on capacity and symptoms, and I should maintain pain-free criteria specifically for sprinting to protect vulnerable tissue under high strain [^112B195b]. I should double-check that any breakthrough pain or swelling prompts a step back in load rather than pushing through, as this is a common pitfall that increases reinjury risk [^112B195b].

> Let me consider adjunctive therapies. Neural tissue mobilization can be performed to reduce adhesions and improve sliding of neural structures, particularly if there is sciatic nerve irritation or radicular features. I should integrate it after the acute inflammatory phase and tailor to symptom provocation during slump or tension tests [^1134EFuN]. Manual therapy and modalities may be used for short-term symptom relief, but I must not rely on them in place of progressive loading, and I should prioritize active rehabilitation to restore function and mitigate recurrence [^112SeDfL].

> Next, I should review PRP and other injectables. Evidence for PRP in acute hamstring strains is mixed and largely negative at high methodological quality. The largest placebo-controlled trial and subsequent meta-analyses show no consistent benefit in time to return to play or reinjury, so routine PRP is not recommended, though it may be considered selectively in chronic, refractory cases with shared decision-making and appropriate counseling about uncertain benefit [^1147uPvW] [^115Nv1L8] [^113azD3a]. I need to ensure I do not overstate any injection as a shortcut to recovery, as exercise-based rehabilitation remains the cornerstone of care [^111F9kQS].

> I will now examine return-to-play decision-making. I should use a multifactorial, criteria-based approach that includes pain-free terminal swing, restoration of strength to at least 90 percent of the contralateral limb, completion of sport-specific drills without pain, and confidence in high-speed tasks. The Functional Assessment Scale for Acute Hamstring Injuries can help standardize readiness checks and track progress over time [^114fmy5V] [^117SCqVQ]. Hold on, I should verify that no single test is sufficient. Combining subjective readiness, clinical examination, and functional performance testing provides a more robust safety net before clearance [^112B195b].

> Let me think about special scenarios. For proximal hamstring avulsions with more than 2 cm retraction or multi-tendon involvement, early surgical repair yields superior functional outcomes and lower re-tear rates than delayed or nonoperative care, so I should expedite referral when these features are present on imaging and examination [^117Tvy9u] [^112Rfx2B]. For distal hamstring pathology, most cases respond to conservative care, but isolated biceps femoris ruptures or chronic refractory cases may warrant surgical consideration; I should individualize based on sport demands and functional goals [^112UBEmo]. For chronic proximal hamstring tendinopathy or partial tears failing conservative therapy, endoscopic debridement or repair can be effective, though I need to counsel that evidence quality varies and patient selection is critical [^117UxXUc] [^1155nciW].

> I should double-check pain-threshold versus pain-free rehabilitation. High-quality RCTs show that pain-threshold rehabilitation does not accelerate return to play versus pain-free approaches but does improve isometric strength recovery and maintenance of fascicle length, suggesting that a modest, symptom-guided load can be beneficial if carefully monitored; I can individualize within this evidence framework rather than adhering rigidly to pain-free only [^1139G2VW] [^115sVFBy]. But wait, what if the athlete is anxious about pain during loading? I should use education and graded exposure to normalize pain during therapeutic loading while avoiding provocative sport-specific tasks until later stages [^112B195b].

> Next, I should review recurrence prevention. Persistent strength asymmetries, especially in the eccentric hamstrings, and shortened biceps femoris fascicles are associated with reinjury risk. Incorporating Nordics and other eccentric work, along with periodic strength testing, helps mitigate these deficits and sustain protective adaptations over the competitive season [^114uLorW] [^111uQJ1d]. I need to ensure the athlete continues a maintenance program after return to sport, as reinjury risk remains elevated for 6 to 12 months and wanes with ongoing eccentric and sport-specific conditioning [^116yPofW].

> Finally, I should confirm that my plan aligns with current guidelines and evidence. The APTA 2022 CPGs endorse eccentric training, progressive agility and trunk stabilization, and criteria-based running progression to improve return-to-play outcomes and reduce reinjury, while emphasizing individualized dosing and symptom-guided progression. This synthesis matches the best available evidence and should anchor my clinical decisions [^112SeDfL] [^111uQJ1d]. I need to ensure I document deviations from guidelines when patient-specific factors warrant them and revisit the plan at each stage to adjust load and expectations based on evolving capacity and goals [^111ha4ES].

Right hamstring pain management centers on **early diagnosis and grading** with clinical assessment and MRI when needed [^117Tvy9u] [^116zdpSK], followed by **individualized rehabilitation** using eccentric loading, progressive agility, and trunk stabilization to reduce pain, restore function, and lower reinjury risk [^112SeDfL] [^111nKTjr]. NSAIDs are generally avoided due to potential harm to healing [^1121Zq4P], and PRP is not recommended for acute injuries [^115Nv1L8] [^113azD3a]. Return to sport is guided by pain-free **ROM**, **strength symmetry**, and sport-specific criteria [^1154tNgq] [^112B195b]; surgery is reserved for complete proximal avulsions or refractory cases [^112Rfx2B] [^116zdpSK].

---

## Clinical assessment and diagnosis

- **Clinical presentation**: Sudden posterior thigh pain during activity, reproduced with stretching/activation, tenderness, and loss of function [^1175tZrn].

- **Physical examination**: Palpation, ROM testing, and resisted muscle activation to localize injury and assess severity [^116FjA8E].

- **Imaging**: MRI is the gold standard for grading and guiding management; ultrasound is adjunctive [^117Tvy9u] [^116zdpSK].

---

## Classification of hamstring injuries

| **Grade** | **Description** | **Clinical findings** | **MRI findings** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Grade I | Mild strain | Minimal pain, no significant functional loss | Minimal fiber disruption |
| Grade II | Partial tear | Moderate pain, functional impairment | Significant fiber disruption |
| Grade III | Complete tear | Severe pain, marked functional loss | Complete rupture |

---

## Non-surgical management

### Acute phase (0–7 days)

- **Protection, rest, ice, compression, elevation (PRICE)**: Control pain and swelling [^115CtpDo].

- **Pain management**: Acetaminophen preferred; avoid NSAIDs due to impaired healing [^1121Zq4P].

- **Early activation**: Gentle isometrics and pain-free ROM to maintain muscle activation [^112jC966].

---

### Subacute phase (1–3 weeks)

- **Eccentric strengthening**: Nordic hamstring, Romanian deadlift, Askling exercises (Extender, Diver, Glider) [^113CBm5F] [^112SeDfL].

- **Progressive agility and trunk stabilization**: Reduce reinjury risk [^111nKTjr] [^1142YwXq].

- **Neural tissue mobilization**: Address adhesions and sciatic nerve involvement [^1134EFuN].

---

### Chronic phase (> 3 weeks)

- **Advanced strengthening**: Emphasize eccentric and functional exercises [^112SeDfL].

- **Sport-specific training**: Gradual return to full activity [^113q2ZGM].

- **Preventive strategies**: Ongoing eccentric and agility training [^114uLorW].

---

## Adjunctive therapies

Adjunctive therapies include **platelet-rich plasma (PRP)**, which shows no significant benefit for acute hamstring injuries and is not recommended [^115Nv1L8] [^116HdHm8]. Corticosteroid injections are not recommended due to potential harm and lack of evidence [^112Rfx2B].

---

## Surgical management

Surgical management is indicated for **complete proximal hamstring avulsions** with > 2 cm retraction or chronic injuries with functional compromise [^117Tvy9u] [^116zdpSK]. Procedures include open or endoscopic repair, with endoscopic techniques offering minimally invasive options and favorable outcomes [^1155nciW] [^117UxXUc].

---

## Return-to-sport criteria

Return-to-sport decisions should be based on **pain-free ROM**, restoration of strength to within 10% of the contralateral limb, and successful completion of sport-specific drills without pain or functional limitation [^113q2ZGM]. Functional testing with the Askling H-test, isokinetic testing, and sprint performance helps confirm readiness [^113q2ZGM].

---

## Prevention of recurrence

Prevention of recurrence relies on **eccentric training** — particularly Nordic hamstring exercises — to reduce reinjury risk by 45–65% [^111F9kQS]. Additional measures include agility and trunk stabilization training, flexibility and neuromuscular control exercises, and workload management to avoid spikes [^116F5qEt].

---

## Patient education and follow-up

Patient education should cover injury mechanisms, rehabilitation expectations, and prevention strategies, while **follow-up** involves regular monitoring of pain, function, and adherence to guide progression and prevent recurrence [^114fmy5V].

---

Right hamstring pain management requires a **structured, evidence-based approach** spanning accurate diagnosis, staged rehabilitation, and individualized return-to-sport planning, with surgery reserved for select cases. This strategy optimizes recovery and minimizes reinjury risk.

### Soft-tissue sources of extra-articular pain following total hip arthroplasty: a comprehensive review [^116q8dUG]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Nonsurgical treatment for hamstring injuries typically includes rest, physical therapy, extracorporeal shock-wave therapy, and biological injections, such as PRP, have shown good results, especially in subacute or chronic cases without notable tendon retraction. Conversely, surgical treatment is generally reserved for more severe cases, such as complete tendon avulsions involving two or three tendons or injuries that did not respond to conservative methods. Open surgery is frequently used for acute or chronic injuries with notable retraction, whereas endoscopic techniques are more suitable for partial tears. Postsurgical outcomes are generally positive, with high rates of patient satisfaction. However, the efficacy of these techniques post THA is limited.

### Early versus delayed lengthening exercises for acute hamstring injury in male athletes: a randomised controlled clinical trial [^116Ratta]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

To evaluate the efficacy of early versus delayed introduction of lengthening (ie, eccentric strengthening) exercises in addition to an established rehabilitation programme on return to sport duration for acute hamstring injuries in a randomised controlled superiority trial.

Methods

90 male participants (age: 18–36 years, median 26 years) with an MRI-confirmed acute hamstring injury were randomised into an early lengthening (at day 1 of rehabilitation) group or a delayed lengthening (after being able to run at 70% of maximal speed) group. Both groups received an established rehabilitation programme. The primary outcome was time to return to sport (ie, time from injury to full unrestricted training and/or match play). The secondary outcome was reinjury rate within 12 months after return to sport. Other outcomes at return to sport included the Askling H-test, hamstring strength, clinical examination and readiness questions.

Results

The return to sport in the early lengthening group was 23 (IQR 16–35) days and 33 (IQR 23–40) days in the delayed lengthening group. For return to sport (in days), the adjusted HR for the early lengthening group compared with the delayed lengthening group was 0.95 (95% CI 0.56 to 1.60, p = 0.84). There was no significant difference between groups for reinjury rates within 2 months (OR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.18 to 5.0, p = 0.94), from 2 to 6 months (OR = 2.00, 95% CI 0.17 to 23.3, p = 0.58), and 6 to 12 months (OR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.05 to 6.6, p = 0.66).

Conclusion

Accelerating the introduction of lengthening exercises in the rehabilitation of hamstring injury in male athletes did not improve the time to return to sport nor the risk of reinjury.

### The ESSKA-AFAS international consensus statement on peroneal tendon pathologies [^115QoHFm]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

What is the optimal treatment for peroneal tendon ruptures?

6.1 Complete rupture of one tendon can be treated conservatively in the inactive and asymptomatic patient.
6.2 In active patients, symptomatic complete rupture of one of the two peroneal tendons should usually be treated with repair. If repair is not possible, a single-stage hamstring autograft or tenodesis may be performed. In tenodesis, there is no preference of PB to PL or PL to PB. When these options are not feasible, FHL or FDL tendon transfer is a final option. In Fig. 3, a schematic algorithm for the treatment of peroneal tendon ruptures is presented.

Rationale

Complete rupture of one of the tendons can be treated conservatively in the event that the patient remains low demand and asymptomatic. In the symptomatic or highly active patient, however, surgical management is often required to support return to sports. Patients with rupture of both tendons benefit from surgical management to treat their symptoms. The panel agrees that, if possible, the tendon tissue should be preserved and, therefore, recommends end-to-end repair of the rupture(s).

In cases when this is not possible, the panel recommended the same treatment algorithm agreed for peroneal tendon tears. If grafting or tenodesis remains insufficient, a tendon transfer may be considered. It should be recognised that elite athletes may not return to their pre-operative level of sports after surgical treatment for peroneal tendon rupture.

What is the optimal treatment for acute peroneal tendon dislocation?

7.1 Treatment of peroneal tendon dislocation should be based on whether it is an acute or chronic injury and whether or not the patient is an athlete.
7.2 The non-athlete with an acute dislocation may be offered conservative management but should be warned that there is a 50% chance of recurrent dislocation. In case of unsuccessful conservative management or chronic instability, surgical intervention is advised.
7.3 Surgery is recommended for elite athletes having sustained either acute or chronic dislocation.
7.4 Surgery in non-athletes with acute peroneal instability consists of reduction of the tendons into the retrofibular groove and repair of the SPR. There was no agreement as to whether to perform an additional groove deepening in non-athletes.
7.5 There was agreement that surgical treatment in athletes should routinely include groove deepening, regardless of other possible treatment gestures. Figure 4 shows a schematic algorithm on treatment of peroneal tendon dislocation.

### Hamstring muscle strain injuries: what can we learn from history? [^1121Zq4P]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were first mentioned in the routine management of muscle strain injuries in the late 1960sand their use has persisted in sports medicine. While they may have a role in limited situations (eg, reducing the incidence of myositis ossificans following muscle contusion injuries), increasing in vitro evidence suggests that NSAIDs may impede regeneration and increase fibrosis during muscle healing, and hence should be considered relatively contraindicated in muscle strain injuries.–

The 1970s and 1980s saw increasing attention being paid to physiotherapeutic means of rehabilitation. There remained a focus on minimising bleeding and inflammation while maximising regeneration, by the increasingly novel use of cooling, electrotherapy (which was clinically already being used in the latter 19th century), manipulative techniquesand specific strengthening programmes. Sports medicine had started to identify the role that muscular trigger points may play in muscle-related pain (recognised in muscles since the 1930s)perhaps contributing to the false positive (MRI negative)muscle injuries. The use of invasive injection techniques such as Traumeel and Actovegin in the management of acute muscle injuries has been promoted in Europe for at least three decades, but their use remains controversial and not established in mainstream sports medicine literature– predominantly due to a lack of scientific evidence. Their clinical use has, however, persisted and despite a lack of substantial evidence, has in recent years expanded beyond Western Europe.

The last two decades have seen an explosion in literature regarding the hamstring muscle strain, with increased understanding of the epidemiology, aetiology and pathophysiology.–Subtle refinement of techniques for minimising inflammation and maximising regeneration has evolved, but many of the underlying principles of treatment have remained unchanged from the mid-20th century. Novel approaches to prevention and treatment continue to appear, but often lack an evidence base. Blood injections have been recognised as potentially therapeutic in sports medicine for over 60 years, and refinement of this in the form of autologous plasma preparations (platelet-rich plasma) has recently been popularised for muscle strain injuries. Currently, the evidence to support this remains limited from the basic science and clinical perspective–– in fact to date the published evidence is only slightly greater than that for the use of hyaluronidase injections, and possibly slightly less than the evidence for the use of corticosteroid injections in acute muscle injuries.

### Hamstring strain injury in athletes [^111eXmpU]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2022). High credibility.

Hamstring strain injury (HSI) clinical practice guideline (CPG) methods and evidence grading describe that the AOPT and AASPT appointed content experts to conduct a review and develop an HSI CPG; databases searched from inception to June 2021 included PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Ovid, and SPORTDiscus, and articles were reviewed using prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria to support clinical decision making for managing adults with HSI. Individual clinical research articles were graded using criteria adapted from the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (Oxford, UK), with teams of 2 reviewers independently assigning levels of evidence and using a critical appraisal tool. The guideline was issued in 2022 based on literature through June 2021 and will be considered for review by 2026, or sooner if important evidence becomes available.

### Management of hamstring injuries: current concepts review [^116zdpSK]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Injuries to the hamstring muscle complex are common in athletes, accounting for between 12% and 26% of all injuries sustained during sporting activities. Acute hamstring injuries often occur during sports that involve repetitive kicking or high-speed sprinting, such as American football, soccer, rugby, and athletics. They are also common in watersports, including waterskiing and surfing. Hamstring injuries can be career-threatening in elite athletes and are associated with an estimated risk of recurrence in between 14% and 63% of patients. The variability in prognosis and treatment of the different injury patterns highlights the importance of prompt diagnosis with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in order to classify injuries accurately and plan the appropriate management. Low-grade hamstring injuries may be treated with nonoperative measures including pain relief, eccentric lengthening exercises, and a graduated return to sport-specific activities. Nonoperative management is associated with highly variable times for convalescence and return to a pre-injury level of sporting function. Nonoperative management of high-grade hamstring injuries is associated with poor return to baseline function, residual muscle weakness and a high-risk of recurrence. Proximal hamstring avulsion injuries, high-grade musculotendinous tears, and chronic injuries with persistent weakness or functional compromise require surgical repair to enable return to a pre-injury level of sporting function and minimize the risk of recurrent injury. This article reviews the optimal diagnostic imaging methods and common classification systems used to guide the treatment of hamstring injuries. In addition, the indications and outcomes for both nonoperative and operative treatment are analyzed to provide an evidence-based management framework for these patients.

### Proximal hamstring tears: endoscopic hamstring repair [^1155nciW]. Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Proximal hamstring tears are common among athletes, especially in sports involving eccentric lengthening during forced hip flexion and knee extension, such as hurdles or water skiing. Tears are described by timing (acute [< 1 month] or chronic) and severity (partial or complete). Complete tears are easily identified with magnetic resonance imaging; however, partial tears may be subtle and potentially missed. The spectrum of pathology associated with acute injuries ranges from minor strains to complete tears or avulsions. Acute tears commonly present as pain and bruising over the posterior thigh along with weakness with active knee flexion and often a sensation of instability of the lower extremity. Chronic injuries typically present with ischial pain associated with repetitive activities, and the spectrum includes chronic tendinopathies, ischial bursitis, partial tears, and nonoperatively treated complete tears. Nonoperative treatment is recommended in the setting of low-grade partial tears and insertional tendinosis. However, failure of nonoperative treatment of partial tears may benefit from surgical debridement and repair. Further, surgical repair of complete tears with retraction is usually recommended for active patients. Historically, surgical treatment has been limited to open surgical approaches, although endoscopic management of proximal hamstring tears and chronic ischial bursitis is an option. Our endoscopic technique employs the use of two anchors, double loaded with high-strength suture, and may support a faster recovery due to decreased surgical morbidity. It is important to note that some patients may not be candidates for this endoscopic repair as a result of several factors, including prior chronic and retracted tears, as well as those with altered regional tissue planes due to prior surgical repair.

### Editorial commentary: proximal hamstring syndrome: another pain in the buttock [^111gimGG]. Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Proximal hamstring injuries cause buttock pain and may result in significant weakness and sciatic neuralgia. Avulsion ruptures involving 2 or more tendons with > 2-cm retraction may benefit from early open surgical repair. More chronic equivalents may benefit from Achilles allograft reconstruction. Chronic proximal hamstring syndrome causing posterior thigh and sit pain may occur from less severe, often repetitive injury to the proximal hamstring origin with secondary sciatic neuralgia from local adhesions or scar entrapment. Recalcitrant cases may benefit from surgical intervention, but the most effective procedure (tenotomy, resection of degenerative tissue with tenotomy vs repair, sciatic neurolysis) has not been established. The role of endoscopic surgery of the proximal hamstring is evolving, but currently may best be indicated for ischial bursectomy, debridement of degenerative tendon tissue, and/or sciatic neurolysis. Although endoscopic proximal hamstring repair is feasible for treating tears with mild retraction, the role of endoscopic (or open) surgery in repair of acute complete tears with < 2-cm retraction or less severe injuries (partial tears or complete tears without retraction) is controversial because most of these injuries may respond to nonoperative management. In this setting, perhaps surgical treatment (open or endoscopic) should be reserved for patients who have failed nonsurgical management.

### Hamstring strain injury in athletes [^112wdKik]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2022). High credibility.

Hamstring strain injury rehabilitation — recommendations: Clinicians should use eccentric training to patient tolerance, added to stretching, strengthening, stabilization, and progressive running programs, to improve RTP time after an individual sustains an HSI. Clinicians should use progressive agility and trunk stabilization, added to a comprehensive impairment-based treatment program with stretching, strengthening, and functional exercises, to reduce reinjury rate after an individual sustains an HSI. Clinicians may perform neural tissue mobilization after injury to reduce adhesions to surrounding tissue and use therapeutic modalities to control pain and swelling early in the healing process.

### Hamstring muscle strain injuries: what can we learn from history? [^111aAfHt]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

In contrast to these underlying principles which have generally withstood the test of time, Delaruealso recommended the use of combined intralesional hyaluronidase/local anaesthetic injections, in the management of acute muscle injuries. This modality appears well recognised at the timebut by the 1970s had lost popularity. Hyaluronidase is an enzyme involved in the breakdown and inactivation of hyaluronic acid and was believed to be of benefit when used in the initial phase of muscle injury. Intriguingly, the in vivo function of hyaluronic acid has recently been elucidated, with its synthesis up-regulated in areas of acute soft tissue injury and functioning to promote and modulate inflammation, as well as potentially minimising scar tissue development. Thus, at least theoretically, minimising any hyaluronic acid excesses in the early phase of an acute soft tissue injury (thereby reducing inflammation) may be of some benefit, although paradoxically hyaluronic acid itself has been advocated for use in soft tissue injuries, with apparently good results.–

While core stability is now recognised as a critical component of hamstring rehabilitation and athletic performance,–the concept was first recognised as early as 1958. Writing after the VI British Empire and Commonwealth Games held in Cardiff the same year, Lloyd (1958)recognised that hamstrings strains were one of the most common injuries observed, but also that the risk for all sports injuries may be minimised by an 'alerted posture'.

"Alerted posture' means alerting the prime fixer muscles so that quick movements can be carried out by activators and synergists acting on a frame already made firm by the prime fixers".42

By the late 1960s, the use of 'enzymatic preparations' including trypsin, chymotrypsin, streptokinase and streptodornase had replaced hyaluronidase injections. The use of oral enzyme preparations in the management of muscle injuries remains popular with some practitioners, despite limited scientific evidence of any benefit. Other medications such as Hirudoid (a heparinoid)and muscle relaxantswere also popular at the time.

### Hamstring injuries in athletes: evidence-based treatment [^116yPofW]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). Medium credibility.

Hamstring injuries are common in athletes and can cause notable disability. They can be separated based on proximal, muscle belly, and distal injuries, with proximal and distal injuries more commonly requiring surgical intervention. Most injuries do not require acute MRI; however, MRI is useful in proximal and distal injuries as well as muscle belly tears that fail to respond to nonsurgical treatment. Acute repair of proximal avulsions, both partial and complete, result in successful outcomes, whereas chronic complete repairs are more difficult and less reliable. Muscle belly injuries have predictable outcomes but recurrence is common. Nonsurgical treatments focus on eccentric strengthening with the possible addition of low WBC platelet-rich plasma, which may have the potential to hasten recovery and decrease re-rupture. Distal injuries are relatively rare but may require surgical intervention. Hamstring reinjury is common, making continuation of preventive therapies after return to sport essential. Future research with larger sample sizes are required to determine how to decrease injury and reinjury rates, to evaluate the efficacy of platelet-rich plasma and to determine other treatments that may accelerate recovery after injury.

### Editorial commentary: endoscopic proximal hamstring repair is safe and effective for refractory tendinosis and partial tears: "Pain in the butt" has an endoscopic solution! [^117UxXUc]. Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

While surgical treatment of acute proximal hamstring ruptures is well understood to be the best treatment option for many patients, treatment of chronic proximal hamstring pathology has lagged, with most management consisting of conservative options: rest, ice, physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, shock-wave therapy, and injections such as corticosteroids and platelet-rich plasma. However, recent research shows that endoscopic repair of chronic proximal hamstring pathology is safe and effective for treating this pathology at short-term follow-up, with high rates of return to activity and patient satisfaction. This presents an appealing treatment option for patients with refractory proximal hamstring pathology, as well as a technique for repairing acute, full-thickness tears. With attention to detail, complication rates are low for endoscopic treatment of both acute and chronic proximal hamstring pathology.

### Pain-free versus pain-threshold rehabilitation following acute hamstring strain injury: a randomized controlled trial [^115sVFBy]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The primary aim was to compare time from acute hamstring strain injury (HSI) to return-to-play (RTP) clearance following a standardized rehabilitation protocol performed within either pain-free or pain-threshold limits. Secondary aims were to compare isometric knee flexor strength, biceps femoris long head (BFLH) fascicle length, fear of movement, and reinjury occurrence at the 6-month follow-up between pain-free and pain-threshold groups.

Design

Randomized controlled trial.

Methods

Forty-three men with acute HSIs were randomly allocated to a pain-free (n = 22) or pain-threshold (n = 21) rehabilitation group. Days from HSI to RTP clearance, isometric knee flexor strength, BFLH fascicle length, fear of movement, and reinjury occurrence at the 6-month follow-up were reported.

Results

Median time from HSI to RTP clearance was 15 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 13, 17) in the pain-free group and 17 days (95% CI: 11, 24) in the pain-threshold group, which was not significantly different (P = 0.37). Isometric knee flexor strength recovery at 90° of hip and 90° of knee flexion was greater in the pain-threshold group at RTP clearance by 15% (95% CI: 1%, 28%) and by 15% (95% CI: 1%, 29%) at 2-month follow-up, respectively. Improvement in BFLH fascicle length from baseline was 0.91 cm (95% CI: 0.34, 1.48) greater at 2-month follow-up in the pain-threshold group. Two reinjuries occurred in both the pain-free and pain-threshold groups between RTP clearance and the 6-month follow-up.

Conclusion

Pain-threshold rehabilitation did not accelerate RTP clearance, but resulted in greater recovery of isometric knee flexor strength and better maintenance of BFLH fascicle length, compared to pain-free rehabilitation.

### A comparison of 2 rehabilitation programs in the treatment of acute hamstring strains [^1142YwXq]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

Study Design

Prospective randomized comparison of 2 rehabilitation programs.

Objectives

The objectives of this study were to compare the effectiveness of 2 rehabilitation programs for acute hamstring strain by evaluating time needed to return to sports and reinjury rate during the first 2 weeks and the first year after return to sport. A third objective was to investigate the relationship between functional testing performance and time to return to sports and reinjury rates after return to sport.

Background

Hamstring muscle strains are common in sports and often result in chronic pain, recurrent hamstring strains, and reduced sports performance. Current rehabilitation programs are primarily developed anecdotally and lack support from prospective, randomized research.

Methods and Measures

Twenty-four athletes with an acute hamstring strain were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 rehabilitation groups. Eleven athletes were assigned to a protocol consisting of static stretching, isolated progressive hamstring resistance exercise, and icing (STST group). Thirteen athletes were assigned to a program consisting of progressive agility and trunk stabilization exercises and icing (PATS group). The number of days for full return to sports, injury recurrence within the first 2 weeks, injury recurrence within the first year of returning to sports, and lower-extremity functional evaluations were collected for all subjects and compared between groups.

Results

The average (± SD) time required to return to sports for athletes in the STST group was 37.4 ± 27.6 days, while the average time for athletes in the PATS group was 22.2 ± 8.3 days. This difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.2455). In the first 2 weeks after return to sports, reinjury rate was significantly greater (P = 0.00343, Fisher's exact test) in the STST group, where 6 of 11 athletes (54.5%) suffered a recurrent hamstring strain after completing the stretching and strengthening program, as compared to none of the 13 athletes (0%) in the PATS group. After 1 year of return to sports, reinjury rate was significantly greater (P = 0.0059, Fisher's exact test) in the STST group. Seven of 10 athletes (70%) who completed the hamstring stretching and strengthening program, as compared to only 1 of the 13 athletes (7.7%) who completed the progressive agility and trunk stabilization program, suffered a recurrent hamstring strain during that 1-year period.

Conclusions

A rehabilitation program consisting of progressive agility and trunk stabilization exercises is more effective than a program emphasizing isolated hamstring stretching and strengthening in promoting return to sports and preventing injury recurrence in athletes suffering an acute hamstring strain. Future randomized clinical trials should investigate the potential for progressive agility and trunk stabilization programs in the prevention of hamstring strain injury during sports.

### Hamstring injuries: a current concepts review: evaluation, nonoperative treatment, and surgical decision making [^117Tvy9u]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The purpose of this current concepts review is to highlight the evaluation and workup of hamstring injuries, nonoperative treatment options, and surgical decision-making based on patient presentation and injury patterns. Hamstring injuries, which are becoming increasingly recognized, affect professional and recreational athletes alike, commonly occurring after forceful eccentric contraction mechanisms. Injuries occur in the proximal tendon at the ischial tuberosity, in the muscle belly substance, or in the distal tendon insertion on the tibia or fibula. Patients may present with ecchymoses, pain, and weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging remains the gold standard for diagnosis and may help guide treatment. Treatment is dictated by the specific tendon(s) injured, tear location, severity, and chronicity. Many hamstring injuries can be successfully managed with nonoperative measures such as activity modification and physical therapy; adjuncts such as platelet-rich plasma injections are currently being investigated. Operative treatment of proximal hamstring injuries, including endoscopic or open approaches, is traditionally reserved for 2-tendon injuries with > 2 cm of retraction, 3-tendon injuries, or injuries that do not improve with 6 months of nonoperative management. Acute surgical treatment of proximal hamstring injuries tends to be favorable. Distal hamstring injuries may initially be managed nonoperatively, although biceps femoris injuries are frequently managed surgically, and return to sport may be faster for semitendinosus injuries treated acutely with excision or tendon stripping in high-level athletes.

### Hamstring muscle strain injuries: what can we learn from history? [^115NiYLS]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Hamstring muscle strain injuries remain one of the most challenging issues facing sports medicine. Over the past 100 years, there has been a gradual evolution in our understanding and management of hamstring injuries, but the challenge of optimising the management of the acutely injured hamstring remains. In recent years, increasingly high-quality studies have addressed the aetiology, risk factors and management of hamstring strains.–Paradoxically, many popular treatment options have little evidence and remain controversial.–The history of hamstring injury management is characterised as a longstanding dissociation between popular clinical techniques and a limited evidence base. Taking a historical perspective on the management of hamstring muscle strains, this study aims to place the current management strategies in a temporal perspective.

"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it". George Santayana, Philosopher, 1863 to 1952

By the mid-18th century, the importance of exercise for health was established, and the physical demands of different forms of exercise were recognised, in a manner not dissimilar to descriptions 200 years later. By the start of the 20th century, the Olympics had been re-invented, sport and exercise were recognised as a means of developing characterand maintaining health in a world experiencing an explosion in leisure time.–Given the limitations of the training methodology of the time, it is possible that muscle strains were a common finding, but there is limited epidemiological literature available from the time.

Limitations and perspectives

Methodological limitations have been previously discussed, however, some limitations of our study should be mentioned. First, concerning the cause of injury, potential difficulties or mistakes could have been reported by physicians between acute and chronic injuries. Indeed, in the present study, 77% of hamstring strains were caused by overuse (20.5% by gradual and 56.5% by sudden onset). This rate is unexpectedly high for this pathology which is most often reported as acute'. udden onset' could have been interpreted as 'acute' by physicians, or athletes could have presented previous symptoms. Second, new injuries, recurrence of previous injury (or reinjury) or injury aggravation (or exacerbation) are difficult to distinguish. In this context, to improve the collection data system by adding items such as 'acute or overuse injury', 'new injury, reinjury or exacerbation'and 'right or left side'could be relevant. A third observation is that 20% to 30% of affected systems, main symptoms and causes of illnesses were reported as 'other', which highlights the collection data system limitations in describing illnesses. The coding system could be improved to allow physicians to report illnesses more accurately. Finally, since almost 20%–30% of injuries and illnesses were not reported by the team physicians, the daily report from team physicians could be not complete. Thus, other tools (retrospective interview of athletes, media monitoring or web-based system) should be used to improve the accuracy of the data.

Hamstring strain injury clinical diagnosis — presentation and directive: Clinicians should make a diagnosis of HSI when an individual presents with a sudden onset of posterior or thigh pain during activity, pain reproduced with hamstring stretching and/or activation, muscle tenderness with palpation, and loss of function. Although evidence for the use of clinical examination to diagnose an HSI is limited, an individual with an acute injury typically presents with a sudden onset of well-localized posterior thigh pain, muscle tenderness, and loss of function, and hamstring group stretching and/or activation may reproduce the pain.

### Efficacy of rehabilitation (lengthening) exercises, platelet-rich plasma injections, and other conservative interventions in acute hamstring injuries: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^115Nv1L8]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Our 2012 review on therapeutic interventions for acute hamstring injuries found a lack of high-quality studies. The publication of new studies warranted an update.

Objectives

To update and reanalyse the efficacy of conservative treatments for hamstring injury.

Data Sources

PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane library, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus were searched till mid-February 2015.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the effect of conservative interventions versus a control group or other intervention for hamstring injuries (HI) were included.

Data Analysis

The search results were screened independently by two authors. Risk of bias assessment was performed using a modified Downs and Black scale with a maximum score of 28. Meta-analysis was performed, where possible.

Main Results

10 RCTs (526 participants), including 6 new RCTs, were identified. Two RCTs were of good/excellent quality, the rest were fair or poor (median Downs and Black score 16 (IQR 9)). Meta-analysis of two studies on rehabilitation (lengthening) exercises showed a significantly reduced time to return to play (HR 3.22 (95% CI 2.17 to 4.77), p < 0.0001) but no difference in risk of re-injury. Meta-analysis of three studies investigating platelet-rich plasma (PRP) showed no effect when compared to control (HR 1.03 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.22), p = 0.73). Limited evidence was found that progressive agility and trunk stability training may reduce re-injury rates.

Conclusions

Meta-analysis showed superior efficacy for rehabilitation exercises. PRP injection had no effect on acute hamstring injury. Limited evidence was found that agility and trunk stabilisation may reduce re-injury rates. The limitations identified in the majority of RCTs should improve the design of new hamstring RCTs.

### Therapeutic interventions for acute hamstring injuries: a systematic review [^116E9Q6j]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the high rate of hamstring injuries, there is no consensus on their management, with a large number of different interventions being used. Recently several new injection therapies have been introduced.

Objective

To systematically review the literature on the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions for acute hamstring injuries.

Data Sources

The databases of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus were searched in May 2011. Study eligibility criteria Prospective studies comparing the effect of an intervention with another intervention or a control group without intervention in subjects with acute hamstring injuries were included.

Data Analysis

Two authors independently screened the search results and assessed risk of bias. Quality assessment of the included studies was performed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database score. A best evidence synthesis was used to identify the level of evidence.

Main Results

Six studies were included in this systematic review. There is limited evidence for a positive effect of stretching, agility and trunk stability exercises, intramuscular actovegin injections or slump stretching in the management of acute hamstring injuries. Limited evidence was found that there is no effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or manipulation of the sacroiliac joint.

Conclusions

There is a lack of high quality studies on the treatment of acute hamstring injuries. Only limited evidence was found to support the use of stretching, agility and trunk stability exercises, intramuscular actovegin injections or slump stretching. Further research is needed using an appropriate control group, randomisation and blinding.

Question 5: What is the Evidence for Treatment of Muscular Pathologies with Injectable Biologics?

Muscle Injury/Strain

Muscle strains and tears are common with the hamstring and rotator cuff muscles frequently injured. For persistent or high-grade injuries, refractory to rest, ice, and physical therapy, injectable biologics have been explored as both monotherapy or as an adjunct to surgical repair. PRP is the most extensively studied injectable biologic for muscle injuries. Multiple clinical trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated faster return to sport with PRP compared to placebo or therapy alone, although the quality of evidence is low due to inconsistency in findings, presence of clinical heterogeneity, and lack of blinding.

Of muscle groups, most regenerative medicine trials have focused on hamstrings. A meta-analysis of 10 RCTs reported non-significant improvements in return to play and re-injury rates in hamstring injuries treated with PRP combined with therapy instead of therapy alone or no treatment. For rotator cuff tears, PRP adjuncts to surgical repair significantly lowered re-tear rates and fatty infiltration on imaging, but not pain or speed of healing.

One double-blind pilot RCT reported improved gluteus medius strength, volume, and histological healing response with placenta-derived MSCs versus placebo administered during and after hip arthroplasty, with no adverse events reported over a 2-year follow-up.

Consensus Point 15. There is limited evidence to suggest that a strategy of PRP with physical therapy is superior to a strategy with just physical therapy alone for treatment of muscle injuries. Current evidence suggests there is likely minimal to no benefit (Level I, Grade C).

### Common running injuries: evaluation and management [^114cY6bJ]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Running is a common form of exercise but predisposes athletes to several running-related injuries. Most running injuries are due to overuse and respond to conservative treatment. Tendinopathies in the patellar, Achilles, and hamstring tendons are common, and are primarily treated with eccentric exercise. Iliotibial band syndrome and patellofemoral pain syndrome are less common than patellar tendinopathy and are treated by strengthening exercises for the core and legs in addition to flexibility exercises. Acute hamstring strains and medial tibial stress syndrome require a period of relative rest, followed by stretching and graded return to activity. Tibial stress fractures require an extended period of relative rest, followed by a more gradual return to activity. Early mobilization improves recovery from ankle sprains, and exercise therapy and functional bracing while running for six to 12 months prevents reinjury. Plantar fasciopathy (plantar fasciitis) can be significantly improved with stretching, heel raises, and orthoses that provide arch support.

### Hamstring injuries: prevention and treatment-an update [^116sjocn]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Implications for clinical management

What are the implications of this research for clinical practice? Perhaps more emphasis should be placed on reduction of pain in the early days after hamstring injury to reduce the neuromuscular inhibition associated with pain, while at the same time encouraging early muscle activation, particularly eccentric exercise at longer muscle lengths, and early return to running with rapid progression to high-speed running.

While the concept of eccentric muscle training as an important component of the rehabilitation process has been with us for many years, it now appears that these exercises must be in the lengthened position. This makes sense when you think that the majority of hamstring muscle injuries are located in the long head of biceps femoris, a muscle that straddles both the hip and knee joints. The standard leg curl exercise, therefore, does not work the long head sufficiently. As a result, lengthening eccentric exercises such as the Nordic hamstring exercise (NHE), the Romanian dead lift and Askling's 'extender', 'diver' and 'glider' exercisesare now becoming the mainstay of postinjury rehabilitation.

Two papers have proposed parameters by which hamstring rehabilitation programmes can be created. Malliaropoulos et al suggested the following parameters — injury mechanism, hip or knee dominant, location, targeted muscle, length rather than strength, training parameters — should be considered when devising a rehabilitation protocol.

Guex and Milletsuggested a conceptual framework for strengthening exercises for hamstring muscles specific to the terminal swing phase of sprinting based on six key parameters (contraction type, load, range of motion, angular velocity, unilateral/bilateral exercises, kinetic chain) for strain prevention. They advocated that in sprinting sports, high-load eccentric contractions should be performed at a slow to moderate angular velocity and focused at the knee joint, while the hip is kept in a large flexion position (80°) in order to expose the hamstrings to a greater elongation stress than occurs in the terminal swing phase. They postulated that as a result, during sprinting, athletes would be better trained to brake knee extension effectively in the whole range of motion without overstretch of the hamstrings.

They also advocated unilateral open kinetic chain exercises based on their functional application. After analysing some of the frequently used hamstring strengthening exercises, they came to the conclusion that the 'optimal exercise had not been designed yet'. Finally, they noted that strain prevention is not only a question of strength, but also depends on the timing of contraction, or a combination of both.

### Older age and a non-sporting injury mechanism are associated with re-injury and the need for revision surgery over a minimum 2-year follow-up following proximal hamstring tendon repair [^116wcqXH]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hamstring injuries are common in both athletic and general populations, often due to a stretch‐type injury caused by extensive hip flexion with an extended knee, or with running during the eccentric contraction required in the late swing phase of gait. It is reported that 12% of these result in a rupture of the proximal tendon attachment. Systematic reviews have shown that surgical repair of these ruptures results in improved clinical scores, high patient satisfaction, good muscle strength restoration and ability to return to sport (RTS). However, repair outcomes for chronic (vs. acute) ruptures are often less favourable. Non‐surgical management may often be attempted in a range of proximal hamstring pathologies and indeed in chronic cases. However, many patients may eventually proceed towards surgery due to persistent pain, reduced strength and limited sports performance.

After proximal hamstring tendon repair, re‐rupture rates across different studies are varied, though pooled re‐rupture rates in systematic reviews spanning the repair of acute and chronic tears have been reported at 1.2%, 2.2% and 2.7%, which are generally higher for chronic tears. One of the challenges is the lack of a clear definition of tear chronicity. While a recent study reported that a longer initial surgery delay was a risk factor for re‐injury after proximal hamstring tendon repair, with an optimal injury‐surgery cut‐off > 32 days as predictive of re‐rupture, extensive variation has been reported in the literature. Across varied studies, tear chronicity has been defined as a surgical delay > 4 weeks, > 6 weeks, > 8 weeks and > 3 months.

### Rehabilitation for hamstring injuries [^116jtMWg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hamstring injuries are a common musculoskeletal disorder, particularly amongst athletes. Many factors have been associated with these injuries, including motor control and strength, soft tissue length and postural alignment. Well-established rehabilitation protocols are commonly used in the treatment of this condition, but their effectiveness remains questionable. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2007.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of all rehabilitation strategies employed to promote the return to full strength, range of movement and function of those individuals presenting with all forms of hamstring injury, regardless of site, severity, onset or level of chronicity.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (to September 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, 2011 Issue 3), MEDLINE (including in-process & other non-indexed citations: 1966 to August 2011), EMBASE (1980 to September 2011), PEDro (2006 to June 2012), CINAHL (1937 to September 2011), AMED (1985 to September 2011), SPORTDiscus (1859 to February 2006), and the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry platform (April 2012).

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials investigating the effect of at least one rehabilitation strategy, in isolation or combination with another, compared with another strategy or control, performed on individuals presenting with hamstring injuries.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors performed study selection. All review authors performed data extraction and assessed risk of bias. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion.

Main Results

Two trials were included in the review, totaling 104 participants. One trial assessed additional (four times a day) versus once daily stretching and the other assessed exercise for movement dysfunction versus stretching and strengthening. The first trial, involving 80 elite athletes, suggested additional stretching could reduce time to return to full activity (mean difference (MD) -1.8 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.1 to -1.5, P < 0.001). The second trial, involving 24 participants from a diverse sporting background, did not find conclusive evidence of a difference (MD -14.5 days, 95% CI -30.64 to 1.64, P = 0.08). It did, however, report reduced re-injury rates using exercise for movement dysfunction of 8% versus 64% (odds ratio (OR) 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.52, P = 0.01). No other outcomes relevant to this review were reported by either study: most notably pain and participant satisfaction.

Authors' Conclusions

Most proposed physiotherapy techniques for rehabilitation of hamstring injuries have not been assessed using randomised trials. Those that have only have single studies with a limited range of participants and outcomes. There is limited evidence to suggest that time to recovery for elite athletes can be reduced with an increased daily frequency of hamstring stretching exercises. There is preliminary evidence from another small study of mixed ability athletes to suggest that exercise to correct movement dysfunction could reduce time to return to full activity and the risk of re-injury. Further studies are required to check these findings. Until further evidence is available, current practice and widely published rehabilitation protocols cannot either be supported or refuted.

Rehabilitation programmes

For a number of years the only RCT comparing different hamstring rehabilitation programmes was Sherry and Beststudy, which reported significantly lower reinjury rates in athletes who completed a progressive agility and trunk stabilisation (PATS) programme, compared to those whose rehabilitation programmes focused on isolated hamstring strengthening and stretching.

Silder et al demonstrated a similar degree of muscle recovery at the time of return to sport in patients with an acute hamstring strain injury treated with either the PATS programme or a programme with a heavy emphasis on eccentric strengthening (PRES).

Askling et al performed two identical studies, one in footballers and other in sprinters and jumpers, and demonstrated that a rehabilitation protocol consisting of mainly lengthening type of exercises (L-protocol) is more effective than a conventional protocol in promoting return to sport after acute hamstring injury. The most conspicuous characteristics of the more successful L-protocol were the systematic attempts to put load on the hamstrings during maximal dynamic lengthening, using exercises entitled The Extender, The Diver and The Glider. On this basis, they recommended that hamstring injury rehabilitation protocols should be preferentially based on strength and flexibility exercises that primarily involve exercises with high loads at long muscle–tendon lengths.

Hamstring strain injury rehabilitation — exercise initiation and dosing: Evidence supports initiating hamstring-strengthening exercises, including eccentrics, early in the rehabilitation process, guided by patient pain tolerance, with successful interventions included 6 to 12 repetitions, depending on the intensity of the exercise, with both load and ROM increased as tolerated; patients should perform the exercises 2 to 3 times per week. Evidence also supports progressive agility and trunk stabilization exercises and a running program involving acceleration and deceleration phases, with a progressive increase in speed and distance, throughout the rehabilitation process as tolerated, and the benefits of eccentric training, added to stretching, strengthening, stabilization, and progressive running programs, are improved RTP times and reduced reinjury rates, while potential harms include a potential to aggravate symptoms and load the activity that was causative.

### Early versus delayed lengthening exercises for acute hamstring injury in male athletes: a randomised controlled clinical trial [^111ZtsiX]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Although we found no statistical difference in return to sport times, we did observe a potentially clinically relevant difference in favour of the early lengthening group (median 8, 95% CI 0 to 14 days faster). This difference can be interpreted as the early lengthening group returning, at worst, at the same time as the delayed lengthening group and, at best, 14 days faster. These data must be interpreted with care and in their correct context (potentially inadequate power). However, we must also recognise that there seem to be no obvious disadvantages to an early introduction of lengthening exercises.

Reinjury rates

Our reinjury rates within 2 months (8.6%), at 2–6 months (4.8%) and at 6–12 (4.8%) months are lower than the control group (using the lengthening exercises) of a recent rehabilitation RCT by Mendiguchia et al. They report a 25% reinjury rate (6 reinjuries) at 6 months after return to sport. However, our reinjury rate is higher than the RCTs that originally employed the lengthening exercises. They reported no reinjuries in 65 athletes during 12 months of follow-up. An apprehension test as a criteria to return to sport was used in these studies. On average, this test prolonged return to sport by a week. Prolonged return to sport might be a key factor in their reduced reinjury rates. Much like comparing return to sport times, comparison of reinjury rates across studies is difficult due to the low absolute numbers of reinjuries, relatively small cohort sizes, population differences, differences in reinjury definitions and differences in the content of rehabilitation. Perhaps the best comparison we can make is with the RCT by Hamilton et al. This RCT was done in the same study centre and used a very similar rehabilitation programme, with an additional platelet-rich or platelet-poor plasma injection. Their reinjury rates up to 6 months (7.4% within 2 months and 2.4% at 6 months, 12 months not reported) are similar to our current cohort and further strengthens the confidence our results. Similarly to this study, almost half of the reinjuries in our cohort happened in the early (within 2 months) period after return to sport.

### Does platelet-rich plasma lead to earlier return to sport when compared with conservative treatment in acute muscle injuries? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112chfKs]. Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare the time to return to sport and reinjury rate after platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection versus control therapy (i.e., physiotherapy or placebo injection) in patients with acute grade I or II muscle strains.

Methods

All eligible studies comparing PRP against a control in the treatment of acute (≤ 7 days) grade I or II muscle strains were identified. The primary outcome was time to return to play. The secondary outcome was the rate of reinjury at a minimum of 6 months of follow-up. Subgroup analysis was performed to examine the efficacy of PRP in hamstring muscle strains alone. The checklist to evaluate a report of a nonpharmacologic trial (CLEAR-NPT) was used to assess the quality of studies.

Results

Five randomized controlled trials including a total of 268 patients with grade I and II acute muscle injuries were eligible for review. The pooled results revealed a significantly earlier return to sport for the PRP group when compared with the control group (mean difference, -5.57 days [95% confidence interval, -9.57 to -1.58]; p = 0.006). Subgroup analysis showed no difference in time to return to sport when comparing PRP and control therapy in grade I and II hamstring muscle strains alone (P = 0.19). No significant difference was noted in the rate of reinjury between the 2 groups (P = 0.50) at a minimum of 6 months of follow-up.

Conclusions

Evidence from the current literature, although limited, suggests that the use of PRP may result in an earlier return to sport among patients with acute grade I or II muscle strains without significantly increasing the risk of reinjury at 6 months of follow-up. However, no difference in time to return to sport was revealed when specifically evaluating those with a grade I or II hamstring muscle strain.

### Editorial commentary: endoscopic treatment of hamstring pathology shows positive patient outcomes [^1147wZ6D]. Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Hamstring pathology is both a common, and commonly missed, source of pain. Acute traumatic tears can be missed or underappreciated, and hamstring tendinopathy and partial-thickness tears are often atraumatic with insidious onset. Partial-thickness hamstring tears or tendinopathy can be underappreciated on magnetic resonance imaging or missed in conjunction with concomitant pathology. Ultrasound-guided diagnostic injections are invaluable tools when sorting through concomitant pathologic processes. If noninvasive treatment options are unsuccessful, injections and surgery are options. Corticosteroid injections have limited utility; platelet-rich plasma injections have shown promise. When surgical treatment is warranted, both endoscopic and open techniques allow for improvement. Although technically demanding, endoscopic hamstring repair allows minimally invasive access to the entirety of the ischial tuberosity, magnified viewing of the tendon structure, and the ability to visualize both the sciatic nerve as well as the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve. These latter 2 structures are most at risk. Maintaining orientation with fluoroscopy enhances arthroscopic understanding of the deep gluteal space, with the posterior aspect of the ischium acting as a safe zone from which careful surgical dissection can begin.

### Clinical and morphological changes following 2 rehabilitation programs for acute hamstring strain injuries: a randomized clinical trial [^111Dx9QR]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Study Design

Randomized, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial.

Objectives

To assess differences between a progressive agility and trunk stabilization rehabilitation program and a progressive running and eccentric strengthening rehabilitation program in recovery characteristics following an acute hamstring injury, as measured via physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Background

Determining the type of rehabilitation program that most effectively promotes muscle and functional recovery is essential to minimize reinjury risk and to optimize athlete performance.

Methods

Individuals who sustained a recent hamstring strain injury were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 rehabilitation programs: (1) progressive agility and trunk stabilization or (2) progressive running and eccentric strengthening. MRI and physical examinations were conducted before and after completion of rehabilitation.

Results

Thirty-one subjects were enrolled, 29 began rehabilitation, and 25 completed rehabilitation. There were few differences in clinical or morphological outcome measures between rehabilitation groups across time, and reinjury rates were low for both rehabilitation groups after return to sport (4 of 29 subjects had reinjuries). Greater craniocaudal length of injury, as measured on MRI before the start of rehabilitation, was positively correlated with longer return-to-sport time. At the time of return to sport, although all subjects showed a near-complete resolution of pain and return of muscle strength, no subject showed complete resolution of injury as assessed on MRI.

Conclusion

The 2 rehabilitation programs employed in this study yielded similar results with respect to hamstring muscle recovery and function at the time of return to sport. Evidence of continuing muscular healing is present after completion of rehabilitation, despite the appearance of normal physical strength and function on clinical examination.

### Early versus delayed lengthening exercises for acute hamstring injury in male athletes: a randomised controlled clinical trial [^111Uopiy]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Deviations from protocol/registration

The decision to hold a primary outcome consensus was not described in our protocol or registration but was decided on soon after the first randomisations. Our study involved mostly professional athletes and clinical providers with many responsibilities and therefore strict adherence to study timelines (eg, the same day return to sport testing, self-decided match play in last stage of sports-specific training) was not always possible. This consensus was conducted in accordance to similar studies and to our primary outcome definition. Lastly, surface EMG testing was abandoned due to the very time-consuming nature of the procedure in an already lengthy assessment process.

Strengths and limitations

The strengths of this study include the randomised and blinded fashion in which the participants from various sports disciplines were treated with standardised, intensive, criteria-based rehabilitation. The main limitation is the greater than expected loss to follow-up (19% instead of the anticipated 10%). We have addressed this through a consensus-based outcome; however, this was not described in our preregistered study protocol. We found a clinically relevant benefit for the early lengthening group, but due to the loss to follow-up we were potentially underpowered for a firm conclusion. As only male athletes were included, generalisability to female athletes is not possible. Imaging of reinjuries was not a standardisable part of the rehabilitation; thus, we did not know the exact location or extent of some reinjuries. Bias regarding progression of rehabilitation could not be excluded as treating clinicians could not feasibly be blinded to treatment group allocation. We had two postrandomisation exclusions due to mistaken eligibility. This did not risk introducing bias, especially given the fact that grade III injuries have prolonged return to sportand a recent hamstring injury increases the risk of reinjury substantially.

### A multifactorial, criteria-based progressive algorithm for hamstring injury treatment [^1168XUVq]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Given the prevalence of hamstring injuries in football, a rehabilitation program that effectively promotes muscle tissue repair and functional recovery is paramount to minimize reinjury risk and optimize player performance and availability.

Purpose

This study aimed to assess the concurrent effectiveness of administering an individualized and multifactorial criteria-based algorithm (rehabilitation algorithm [RA]) on hamstring injury rehabilitation in comparison with using a general rehabilitation protocol (RP).

Methods

Implementing a double-blind randomized controlled trial approach, two equal groups of 24 football players (48 total) completed either an RA group or a validated RP group 5 d after an acute hamstring injury.

Results

Within 6 months after return to sport, six hamstring reinjuries occurred in RP versus one injury in RA (relative risk = 6, 90% confidence interval = 1–35; clinical inference: very likely beneficial effect). The average duration of return to sport was possibly quicker (effect size = 0.34 ± 0.42) in RP (23.2 ± 11.7 d) compared with RA (25.5 ± 7.8 d) (-13.8%, 90% confidence interval = -34.0% to 3.4%; clinical inference: possibly small effect). At the time to return to sport, RA players showed substantially better 10-m time, maximal sprinting speed, and greater mechanical variables related to speed (i.e., maximum theoretical speed and maximal horizontal power) than the RP.

Conclusions

Although return to sport was slower, male football players who underwent an individualized, multifactorial, criteria-based algorithm with a performance- and primary risk factor-oriented training program from the early stages of the process markedly decreased the risk of reinjury compared with a general protocol where long-length strength training exercises were prioritized.

### London international consensus and Delphi study on hamstring injuries part 2: operative management [^112Rfx2B]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The key indications for surgical repair of hamstring injuries (HSIs) remain unclear in the literature due to a lack of high-level evidence and expert knowledge. The 2020 London International Hamstring Consensus meeting aimed to highlight clear surgical indications and to create a foundation for future research. A literature review was conducted followed by a modified Delphi process, with an international expert panel. Purposive sampling was used with two rounds of online questionnaires and an intermediate round involving a consensus meeting. The initial information gathering (round 1) questionnaire was sent to 46 international experts, which comprised open-ended questions covering decision-making domains in HSI. Thematic analysis of responses outlined key domains, which were evaluated by a smaller international subgroup (n = 15) comprising clinical academic sports medicine physicians, physiotherapists and orthopaedic surgeons in a consensus meeting. After group discussion of each domain, a series of consensus statements were prepared, debated and refined. A round 2 questionnaire was sent to 112 international hamstring experts to vote on these statements and determine level of agreement. The consensus threshold was set a priori at 70% agreement. Rounds 1 and 2 survey respondents were 35/46 (76%) and 99/112 (88.4%), respectively. The consensus group agreed that the indications for operative intervention included: gapping at the zone of tendinous injury (87.2% agreement) and loss of tension (70.7%); symptomatic displaced bony avulsions (72.8%); and proximal free tendon injuries with functional compromise refractory to non-operative treatment (72.2%). Other important considerations for operative intervention included: the demands of the athlete/patient and the expected functional outcome (87.1%) based on the anatomy of the injury; the risk of functional loss/performance deficit with non-operative management (72.2%); and the capacity to restore anatomy and function (87.1%). Further research is needed to determine whether surgery can reduce the risk of reinjury as consensus was not reached within the whole group (48.2%) but was agreed by surgeons (70%) in the cohort. The consensus group did not support the use of corticosteroids or endoscopic surgery without further evidence. These guidelines will help standardise treatment of HSIs, specifically the indications and decision-making for surgical intervention.

### Motor imagery during action observation increases eccentric hamstring force: an acute non-physical intervention [^112KEDxV]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Rehabilitation professionals typically use motor imagery (MI) or action observation (AO) to increase physical strength for injury prevention and recovery. Here we compared hamstring force gains for MI during AO (AO+MI) against two pure MI training groups.

Materials and Methods

Over a 3-week intervention physically fit adults imagined Nordic hamstring exercises in both legs and synchronized this with a demonstration of the same action (AO+MI), or they purely imagined this action (pure MI), or imagined upper-limb actions (pure MI-control). Eccentric hamstring strength gains were assessed using ANOVAs, and magnitude-based inference (MBI) analyses determined the likelihood of clinical/practical benefits for the interventions.

Results

Hamstring strength only increased significantly following AO+MI training. This effect was lateralized to the right leg, potentially reflecting a left-hemispheric dominance in motor simulation. MBIs: The right leg within-group treatment effect size for AO+MI was moderate and likely beneficial (d = 0.36), and only small and possibly beneficial for pure MI (0.23). Relative to pure MI-control, effects were possibly beneficial and moderate for AO+MI (0.72), although small for pure MI (0.39).

Conclusions

Since hamstring strength predicts injury prevalence, our findings point to the advantage of combined AO+MI interventions, over and above pure MI, for injury prevention and rehabilitation. Implications for rehabilitation While hamstring strains are the most common injury across the many sports involving sprinting and jumping, Nordic hamstring exercises are among the most effective methods for building eccentric hamstring strength, for injury prevention and rehabilitation. In the acute injury phase it is crucial not to overload damaged soft tissues, and so non-physical rehabilitation techniques are well suited to this phase. Rehabilitation professionals typically use either motor imagery or action observation techniques to safely improve physical strength, but our study shows that motor imagery during observation of Nordic hamstring exercises offers a safe, affordable and more effective way to facilitate eccentric hamstring strength gains, compared with pure motor imagery. Despite using bilateral imagery and observation training conditions in the present study, strength gains were restricted to the right leg, potentially due to a left hemispheric dominance in motor simulation.

### Proximal hamstring tendinopathy: clinical aspects of assessment and management [^112PEnY7]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Synopsis Proximal hamstring tendinopathy (PHT) typically manifests as deep buttock pain at the hamstring common origin. Both athletic and nonathletic populations are affected by PHT. Pain and dysfunction are often long-standing and limit sporting and daily functions. There is limited evidence regarding diagnosis, assessment, and management; for example, there are no randomized controlled trials investigating rehabilitation of PHT. Some of the principles of management established in, for example, Achilles and patellar tendinopathy would appear to apply to PHT but are not as well documented. This narrative review and commentary will highlight clinical aspects of assessment and management of PHT, drawing on the available evidence and current principles of managing painful tendinopathy. The management outline presented aims to guide clinicians as well as future research. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2016;46(6):483–493. Epub 15 Apr 2016. doi:10.2519/jospt.2016.5986.

### Pain-free versus pain-threshold rehabilitation following acute hamstring strain injury: a randomized controlled trial [^1139G2VW]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Randomized controlled trial.

Background

Conventional guidelines recommend hamstring strain injury (HSI) rehabilitation should only be performed and progressed in complete absence of pain, despite lack of comparison to alternative approaches.

Objectives

The primary aim of this study was to compare the number of days from acute HSI to return to play (RTP) clearance following a standardised rehabilitation protocol performed within either pain-free or pain-threshold limits. The secondary aims were to compare isometric knee flexor strength, biceps femoris long head (BFlh) fascicle length, fear of movement and re-injury during a six-month follow-up between pain-free and pain-threshold groups.

Methods

Forty-three men with acute HSIs were randomly allocated to either a pain-free (n = 22) or pain-threshold (n = 21) rehabilitation group. Days from HSI to RTP clearance, isometric knee flexor strength, BFlh fascicle length, fear of movement and re-injuries within six-month follow-up were reported.

Results

The median time from HSI to RTP clearance was 15 days (95% CI = 13 to 17) in the pain-free group and 17 days (95% CI = 11 to 24) in the pain-threshold group, which was not significantly different (p = 0.37). Recovery of isometric knee flexor strength at 90/90 degrees of hip/knee flexion was greater in the pain-threshold group at RTP clearance by 15% (95% CI = 1 to 28) and by 15% (95% CI = 1 to 29) at two-month follow-up. BFlh fascicles were 0.91cm (95% CI = 0.34 to 1.48) longer at two-month follow-up in the pain-threshold group. Two re-injuries occurred in both the pain-free and pain-threshold group during six-month follow-up.

Conclusion

Pain-threshold rehabilitation did not accelerate RTP clearance but did result in greater recovery of isometric knee flexor strength and better maintenance of BFlh fascicle length improvements compared to pain-free rehabilitation.

### Proximal hamstring tendon injuries: diagnosis and management [^117XbHut]. Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Proximal hamstring tendon injuries are common among active and athletic populations and exist on a spectrum ranging from proximal tendinopathy to partial tears to complete avulsions. Imaging should include plain radiography as bony avulsions have been observed in skeletally immature patients. Magnetic resonance imaging is diagnostic in the setting of both partial tears and complete tears. A high-intensity (on T2-weighted images), crescent-shaped signal at the tendon-bone interface ("sickle sign") is indicative of a partial-thickness tear of the proximal hamstring tendons. In the setting of complete avulsions, magnetic resonance imaging is also useful in demonstrating the extent of tendon avulsion and quantifying the number of tendons torn. Nonoperative treatment for proximal tendinopathy, acute partial tears, and complete tears with minimal tendon retraction includes activity modification, eccentric stretching and strengthening, and potentially platelet rich plasma injections. Surgical repair should be considered for partial tears refractory to nonoperative management, acute tears with greater than 2 cm of distal retraction, and/or chronic retracted tears. The surgical approach is generally made through a transverse incision within the gluteal crease, which can be extended distally in a "T" configuration in the setting of chronic retracted tears. In the setting of chronic retracted tears, a sciatic nerve neurolysis may be required owing to scarring. Following the surgical procedure, a graduated rehabilitation protocol is commenced with the expectation for a return to full, unrestricted activities by 6 months postoperative, and excellent outcomes can be anticipated. Compared with repair of chronic tears, acute repairs have improved functional outcomes and lower re-tear rates.

### Diagnosis, prevention and treatment of common lower extremity muscle injuries in sport-grading the evidence: a statement paper commissioned by the Danish society of sports physical therapy (DSSF) [^111F9kQS]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We have graded the quality of evidence concerning diagnosis, prevention and treatment of the most common muscle injuries and provide a comprehensive and up-to-date summary of the best available evidence. Most clinical tests showed very low to low diagnostic effectiveness. For hamstring injury prevention, programmes that included the Nordic hamstring exercise resulted in a risk reduction of 45% to 65% when compared with usual care. For prevention of groin injuries, both the FIFA 11+ programme and the Copenhagen adductor strengthening programme resulted in risk reduction of 41% when compared with usual care. For treatment of hamstring injuries, lengthening hamstring exercises showed fastest return to play with a lower reinjury rate when compared with conventional hamstring exercises. Platelet-rich plasma had no effect on time to return-to-play and reinjury risk after a hamstring injury when compared with placebo or rehabilitation. Most outcomes for all muscle injuries and domains were graded as very low to moderate quality of evidence, indicating that further high-quality research is likely to have an important impact on the confidence in the effect estimates. At this point, research on diagnosis, prevention and treatment of muscle injuries primarily concerns hamstring muscle injuries, with only limited research on quadriceps, adductor and calf muscle injuries. Furthermore, muscle injury prevention research is mainly conducted in football, whereas muscle injury treatment research is conducted across different sports.

What is already known

Lower extremity muscle strain injuries are very common in multidirectional sports.
The quality of evidence related to diagnosis, prevention and treatment for the most common muscle injuries (hamstring, adductor, calf, rectus femoris/quadriceps) have not been investigated.

What are the new findings

Most clinical tests for acute muscle injuries show very low to low diagnostic effectiveness.
Hamstring and groin injuries can be reduced 40% to 65% using specific exercise interventions.
Lengthening hamstring exercises show fastest return to play and lower reinjury rate compared with conventional exercises, and platelet-rich plasma offers no additional effect to current rehabilitation.
Most outcomes were graded as very low to moderate quality of evidence, thus further high-quality research is likely to have an important impact on the confidence in the effect estimates.

### Clinical principles in the management of hamstring injuries [^113cjjoL]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Hamstring injuries are among the most common muscle injuries seen in sports clinical practice. This narrative review covers essential knowledge of hamstring injuries, ranging from strains to total proximal three-tendon ruptures. The primary aim is to provide basic information for clinicians and sports medicine therapists dealing with hamstring problems.

Methods

In this review, existing literature of hamstring injuries was taken together. Emphasis was given to subjects less well covered in previous reviews, such as preventive measures, as well as the most relevant information needed in the treatment of these injuries.

Results

Occasionally, symptoms remain after hamstring injuries which can be successfully treated with surgery. Knowledge of the effectiveness of preventive measures and nonsurgical and surgical treatment is limited by small studies of low evidence level.

Conclusions

Evidence-based treatment algorithms are not available. Larger studies of better quality with more concrete grading of hamstring tears are needed to improve knowledge in prevention and treatment of hamstring injuries.

Level Of Evidence

### Conservative interventions for managing exercise-related musculoskeletal groin pain [^11459iQu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Certainty of the evidence assessment

Two review authors (APPS and AJSO) will independently assess the certainty of the evidence following the GRADE approach, as described in Chapter 14 of the Cochrane Handbook. In case of disagreement, a third review author (LH) will be consulted to reach consensus.

The assessment will consider five domains: (1) risk of bias (limitations in study design and implementation); (2) inconsistency (variability in results across studies); (3) indirectness (applicability of the evidence to the research question); (4) imprecision (statistical uncertainty or small sample sizes); (5) publication bias (potential selective reporting of results). We will classify the certainty of the evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low. The certainty starts as high when the evidence is supported by well‐conducted RCTs, and is downgraded by one or two levels, depending on the extent of concerns in each domain. We will document our justifications for any downgrading, and consider them in the interpretation of our findings.

To present the findings clearly, we will construct summary of findings (SoF) tables for these main comparisons.

Conservative intervention (single or multimodal) versus no or minimal intervention
Conservative intervention (single or multimodal) versus placebo or sham intervention
Comparison between two conservative interventions (single or multimodal)

Each SoF table will include:

The population, intervention, comparison, and key outcomes (pain, function, quality of life, and return to sports) at the intermediate‐term time point (≥ 12 weeks, no later than six months after the end of the treatment)
Relative or absolute effect estimates, or both
Number of participants and included studies
Certainty of the evidence, based on GRADE criteria
Explanatory footnotes when necessary

We will use GRADEpro GDT software to create these tables and ensure transparency in the assessment process.

Consumer involvement

Consumers will not be involved in this review due to limited resources. This systematic review did not receive any specific funding from public, commercial, or not‐for‐profit organizations.

### Hamstring injuries: prevention and treatment-an update [^116HdHm8]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Is there a role for Platelet-rich plasma?

The use of autologous blood injections, such as platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has become widespread in recent years, primarily in the treatment of chondral and tendon problems. Recently the first two high-quality studies have been published examining the use of PRP in muscle injuries. Two studies produced conflicting results.

Using a double-blind, randomised and multicentre approach, Reurink et al recruited 80 recreational athletes with hamstring muscle strain injuries, and infiltrated the injured area with either isotonic saline or a standardised formulation of PRP. Ultimately, the authors found no statistical or clinically significant difference in either of their key outcome measures, RTP duration and reinjury rate, leading them to conclude that PRP is no more effective than a placebo injection of saline.

Hamid et al compared a group who received a PRP injection along with a standard rehabilitation programme with a control group who received the rehabilitation programme alone and found that patients in the PRP group achieved full recovery significantly earlier than controls. Significantly, lower pain severity scores were observed in the PRP group throughout the study. They concluded that a single autologous PRP injection combined with a rehabilitation programme was significantly more effective in treating hamstring injuries than a rehabilitation programme alone.

Of the two studies, the Reurink paper is of substantially higher quality with its use of a placebo saline injection. Previous PRP studies using saline as placebohave also failed to confirm the improvements found in those studies without placebo. There is not at this stage sufficient evidence to advocate the use of PRP in acute muscle injuries.

### Rehabilitation for hamstring injuries [^114DvaE2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Hamstring injuries are a common musculoskeletal disorder, particularly amongst athletes. Many factors have been associated with these injuries including motor control and strength, soft tissue length and postural alignment. Well established rehabilitation protocols are commonly used in the treatment of this condition, but their effectiveness remains questionable.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of all rehabilitation strategies employed to promote the return to full strength, range of movement and function of those individuals presenting with all forms of hamstring injury, regardless of site, severity, onset or level of chronicity.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (to January 2006), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 1), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PEDro - The Physiotherapy Evidence Database, CINAHL, AMED, SPORTDiscus and reference lists of articles. Date of last search: February 2006. No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

Selected studies were randomised controlled trials or randomised comparative trials, investigating the effect of at least one rehabilitation strategy, in isolation or combination with another, compared to another strategy or control, performed on individuals presenting with hamstring injuries.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors performed study selection. Three review authors performed data extraction and methodological quality assessment. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion.

Main Results

Three trials were included in the review. The main results present limited evidence over a range of techniques and patient groups. There was no trial of intervention versus rest. Only two small trials compared times to return to normal function, and definition of this outcome varied between studies. The first trial, involving 80 athletes, suggested stretching four times a day instead of just once and resulted in a statistically significant reduction in time to return to normal function (mean difference (MD) -1.8 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.15 to -1.45, P < 0.001). The second trial, with 24 participants from a diverse sporting background, found that progressive agility and trunk stabilization exercises and icing did not achieve a statistically significant reduction in time to return to full function when compared to stretching and progressive resistance exercises and icing (MD -14.5 days, 95% CI -30.64 to 1.64, P = 0.08). The third trial, conducted with 20 non-athletes, suggests there was no evidence of effect with manual therapy on soft tissue length (MD 10.4 degrees, 95% CI -3.19 to 23.99 in favour of manual therapy, P = 0.13), on hamstring muscle peak torque (MD -0.7 foot-pounds, 95% CI -18.45 to 17.05 in favour of control, P = 0.94), or on quadriceps femoris muscle peak torque (MD -22.1 foot-pounds, 95% CI -59.00 to 14.80 in favour of control, P = 0.24) following a single treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

There is limited evidence to suggest that rate of recovery can be increased with an increased daily frequency of hamstring stretching exercises. Consideration should be given to the lumbar spine, sacroiliac and pelvic alignment and postural control mechanisms when managing hamstring injuries. Lumbar stability and pelvic motor control may also be factors in reducing the rate of recurrence of hamstring injury. Until further evidence is available, current practice and widely published rehabilitation protocols cannot either be supported or refuted.

### Early versus delayed lengthening exercises for acute hamstring injury in male athletes: a randomised controlled clinical trial [^112jrmzK]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This RCT showed that accelerating the introduction of lengthening exercises in the rehabilitation of hamstring injury did not improve the time to return to sport nor the risk of reinjury.

Return to sport times

Our time to return to sports (median 23, IQR 16–35 for early lengthening and 33, IQR 23–40 days for delayed lengthening) is comparable to the first Askling RCT using lengthening exercises in football players (mean 28 ± 15 days), but markedly faster than their second study on track and field athletes (mean 49 ± 26 days). Time to return to sport varies substantially across studies. Partly, this can be attributed to the varying definitions of return to sport, interventions and (sporting) populations, which makes direct comparisons difficult. For example, track and field athletes have different biomechanical and performance demands compared with our cohort of predominantly football players. Despite these limitations, most other RCTs that use lengthening exercisesand/or progressive runningin their programmes have similar return to sport times with a reported mean ranging from 23.2 to 28.8 days. One other RCT, that also employed progressive running, reported markedly faster return to sport times (intervention group 17 days, 95% CI 11 to 24). However, since they did not examine cases with MRI, it is possible that their sample included cases without structural changes, which have a markedly better prognosis than MRI-positive injuries.

Timing is the primary difference in this criteria-based study as compared with other studies that also employ early eccentric work. We randomised between an early and late start of exercises rather than the randomisation between types of exercises. The two rehabilitation protocols in the Askling trials included different exercises. Thus, we do not know whether it was the timing of the lengthening exercises (which were introduced from the early rehabilitation) that caused the positive effect in the L-protocol versus the C-protocol, only that these exercises were more beneficial than the exercises in the C-protocol. The Bayer trial used a time-based protocol and they did not start with dynamic eccentric exercises before week five. In the Hickey trial, they compared similar eccentric exercises (that were initiated early in both groups), but with different pain threshold. In our study, both protocols were performed within pain free limit.

- Mind-body practices
- Weight loss
- Psychological therapies
- Manual therapies
- Mindfulness-based stress reduction.
- Low-level laser therapy
- Acupuncture
- Massage
- Spinal manipulation Exercise, mind-body interventions, and behavioral treatments can encourage active patient participation in the care plan and help address the effects of pain in the patient's life. Nonopioid medications Several nonopioid pharmacologic therapies can be used for subacute and chronic pain conditions. Some examples include:

- Topical and oral NSAIDs
- Acetaminophen
- Tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants
- Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor antidepressants
- Anticonvulsants
- Capsaicin and lidocaine patches. For example, for many people, low-cost group aerobics can be as effective as individual physical therapy for reducing low back pain and improving function. While the cost may vary, physical therapy can be helpful, particularly for patients who have limited access to safe public spaces or public recreation facilities for exercise or have not improved with low-intensity physical exercise.

### Platelet-rich plasma injections for the treatment of hamstring injuries: a randomized controlled trial [^1113KHWH]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

A hamstring injury is one of the most common types of injury affecting athletes. Despite this, the optimal management of hamstring muscle injuries is not yet defined. The effect of autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy on the recovery of hamstring injuries is unclear.

Purpose

To investigate the effect of a single PRP injection in the treatment of grade 2 hamstring muscle injuries.

Study Design

Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.

Methods

Twenty-eight patients diagnosed with an acute hamstring injury were randomly allocated to autologous PRP therapy combined with a rehabilitation program or a rehabilitation program only. The primary outcome of this study was time to return to play. In addition, changes in pain severity and pain interference scores over time were examined.

Results

Patients in the PRP group achieved full recovery significantly earlier than controls (P = 0.02). The mean time to return to play was 26.7 ± 7.0 days and 42.5 ± 20.6 days for the PRP and control groups, respectively (t(22) = 2.50, P = 0.02). Significantly lower pain severity scores were observed in the PRP group throughout the study. However, no significant difference in the pain interference score was found between the 2 groups.

Conclusion

A single autologous PRP injection combined with a rehabilitation program was significantly more effective in treating hamstring injuries than a rehabilitation program alone.

### Distal hamstring injuries and disorders [^112UBEmo]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Hamstring injuries are a common injury sustained by athletes with most injuries occurring as strain injuries within the muscle belly or at the proximal musculotendinous junction. Distal hamstring pathology is relatively uncommon but comprises a collection of both acute and chronic diagnoses that can manifest with symptoms either on the medial or lateral side of the knee based on which hamstring tendons are involved. Pes anserinus bursitis is the most common of these distal hamstring pathologies with other chronic diagnoses, including snapping medial hamstrings or snapping biceps femoris. Acute biceps femoris ruptures can occur in an isolated fashion but most often occur in the setting of concomitant posterolateral corner injury as a result of high-energy trauma. Isolated semitendinosus ruptures can occur with lower-energy acute events, commonly with track and field events. Most distal hamstring pathology can be treated without surgery and do well with conservative treatment. However, acute avulsion injuries often require surgical intervention, as can chronic problems that do not adequately respond to prolonged conservative treatment. Treatment algorithms for distal hamstring injuries are less well-developed than more proximal injuries owing to their lower incidence. This review focuses on distal hamstring injuries, the state of current literature, and treatment strategies.

### Hamstring strain injury in athletes [^112ommnJ]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2022). High credibility.

Hamstring strain injury (HSI) clinical practice guideline (CPG) scope and outcome focus states that the CPG includes sports-related overloading and overstretching injuries to myofascial or musculotendinous structures in any combination of the 3 hamstring muscles and excludes isolated tendon injuries because tendon-only injuries differ in incidence, mechanism, pathoanatomy, clinical course, and treatment. Ultimate rehabilitation success is defined by return to sports participation while preventing reinjury, and only studies directly assessing time to return to play (RTP) and reinjury rates were included when discussing interventions for HSIs.

### Hamstring strain injuries: recommendations for diagnosis, rehabilitation, and injury prevention [^111iUatg]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Hamstring strain injuries remain a challenge for both athletes and clinicians, given their high incidence rate, slow healing, and persistent symptoms. Moreover, nearly one third of these injuries recur within the first year following a return to sport, with subsequent injuries often being more severe than the original. This high reinjury rate suggests that commonly utilized rehabilitation programs may be inadequate at resolving possible muscular weakness, reduced tissue extensibility, and/or altered movement patterns associated with the injury. Further, the traditional criteria used to determine the readiness of the athlete to return to sport may be insensitive to these persistent deficits, resulting in a premature return. There is mounting evidence that the risk of reinjury can be minimized by utilizing rehabilitation strategies that incorporate neuromuscular control exercises and eccentric strength training, combined with objective measures to assess musculotendon recovery and readiness to return to sport. In this paper, we first describe the diagnostic examination of an acute hamstring strain injury, including discussion of the value of determining injury location in estimating the duration of the convalescent period. Based on the current available evidence, we then propose a clinical guide for the rehabilitation of acute hamstring injuries, including specific criteria for treatment progression and return to sport. Finally, we describe directions for future research, including injury-specific rehabilitation programs, objective measures to assess reinjury risk, and strategies to prevent injury occurrence.

### London international consensus and Delphi study on hamstring injuries part 3: rehabilitation, running and return to sport [^112B195b]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Hamstring injuries (HSIs) are the most common athletic injury in running and pivoting sports, but despite large amounts of research, injury rates have not declined in the last 2 decades. HSI often recur and many areas are lacking evidence and guidance for optimal rehabilitation. This study aimed to develop an international expert consensus for the management of HSI. A modified Delphi methodology and consensus process was used with an international expert panel, involving two rounds of online questionnaires and an intermediate round involving a consensus meeting. The initial information gathering round questionnaire was sent to 46 international experts, which comprised open-ended questions covering decision-making domains in HSI. Thematic analysis of responses outlined key domains, which were evaluated by a smaller international subgroup (n = 15), comprising clinical academic sports medicine physicians, physiotherapists and orthopaedic surgeons in a consensus meeting. After group discussion around each domain, a series of consensus statements were prepared, debated and refined. A round 2 questionnaire was sent to 112 international hamstring experts to vote on these statements and determine level of agreement. Consensus threshold was set a priori at 70%. Expert response rates were 35/46 (76%) (first round), 15/35 (attendees/invitees to meeting day) and 99/112 (88.2%) for final survey round. Statements on rehabilitation reaching consensus centred around: exercise selection and dosage (78.8%-96.3%agreement), impact of the kinetic chain (95%), criteria to progress exercise (73%-92.7%), running and sprinting (83%-100%) in rehabilitation and criteria for return to sport (RTS) (78.3%-98.3%). Benchmarks for flexibility (40%) and strength (66.1%) and adjuncts to rehabilitation (68.9%) did not reach agreement. This consensus panel recommends individualised rehabilitation based on the athlete, sporting demands, involved muscle(s) and injury type and severity (89.8%). Early-stage rehab should avoid high strain loads and rates. Loading is important but with less consensus on optimum progression and dosage. This panel recommends rehabilitation progress based on capacity and symptoms, with pain thresholds dependent on activity, except pain-free criteria supported for sprinting (85.5%). Experts focus on the demands and capacity required for match play when deciding the rehabilitation end goal and timing of RTS (89.8%). The expert panellists in this study followed evidence on aspects of rehabilitation after HSI, suggesting rehabilitation prescription should be individualised, but clarified areas where evidence was lacking. Additional research is required to determine the optimal load dose, timing and criteria for HSI rehabilitation and the monitoring and testing metrics to determine safe rapid progression in rehabilitation and safe RTS. Further research would benefit optimising: prescription of running and sprinting, the application of adjuncts in rehabilitation and treatment of kinetic chain HSI factors.

### Early versus delayed lengthening exercises for acute hamstring injury in male athletes: a randomised controlled clinical trial [^113MtATS]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Primary outcome consensus

We held two consensus meetings to agree on return to sports dates for every participant as per our study protocol's definition. These meetings were not originally described in our protocol (see 'Discussion'). No clinical (eg, injury dates) or demographic information was used in this consensus. The primary, secondary and other outcome measures were not part of this consensus. We used the following decision algorithm: (1) if the final sports specific training session and discharge by the sports medicine physician was performed on different days, the day of final sports-specific training was decided as the date of return to sport, (2) if a participant decided to play a game or fully train with their team before discharge, this was noted as the self-decided return to sport and a deviation from protocol, (3) if a participant stopped coming (ie, lost to follow-up) or for some reason did not complete the protocol, they were censored at the latest date they were seen for physiotherapy (days from injury until last physiotherapy session were calculated outside of this consensus). Censoring was performed for its use in our primary outcome statistical model (see below). Online supplemental table S1 describes the characteristics of the participants, reasons for censoring and censoring outcome. Online supplemental table S2 describes the characteristics of the participants, consensus on return to sport date per the above described decision algorithm and the return to sport in days (note: the return to sport in days was not part of the consensus).

Compliance

We took a pragmatic approach to calculate overall compliance with rehabilitation. Participants were advised to attend 5 days per week (ie, a maximum possible attendance of 5 days per week with no treatments over weekends). The days between the date of the first blinded assessment and the date of last attendance of sports-specific training was deemed the maximum possible attendance. This was juxtaposed against the actual number of days attended, which was recorded by the coordinating researcher, and calculated as a percentage of compliance up to 100%. The maximum possible attendance was adjusted on a case by case basis if participants were enrolled during a religious holiday (due to governmental mandated closing of operations) or had physiotherapy on weekends. We did not calculate compliance for censored participants.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on regenerative medicine treatment for chronic pain: a consensus report from a multispecialty working group [^114uk4jV]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Proximal Hamstring Tendinosis and Gluteal Tendinosis

A double-blinded RCT on proximal hamstring tendinopathy compared PRP versus whole blood injections. While patients in the cohort receiving whole blood experienced improved outcomes at 12 weeks, patients in the PRP cohort demonstrated superior analgesia and functionality at the six-month endpoint. Conversely, Levy et al demonstrated equivocal results at 8 weeks following PRP injection, although it is possible that the study duration of 8 weeks may have been too short for the therapeutic effect of PRP to manifest. A double-blinded RCT compared intratendinous PRP injection versus CSI for gluteus medius and minimus tendinopathy. The study reported superior analgesia and physical function in the PRP cohort compared to the CSI cohort at 12 and 24 weeks, which sustained improvement at two years.

Consensus Point 14. There is inconsistent but promising evidence from a few RCTs on the use of PRP for hamstring and gluteal medius/minimus tendinopathy (Level I, Grade C).

### Early versus delayed lengthening exercises for acute hamstring injury in male athletes: a randomised controlled clinical trial [^113q2ZGM]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Other outcome measures (at baseline and return to sport)

All participants were assessed by an independent and blinded sports physiotherapist (with at least 3 years of experience) prior to the start of the intervention and at discharge. The assessments included demographics, patient history taking and clinical examination. Return to sport assessment was done as soon as a participant finalised their last sports-specific training session and included additional measurements such as isokinetic muscle strength testing, the Nordic hamstring exercise test, a dynamic flexibility H-testand subjective questions regarding participant readiness (see online supplemental table S4). Prior to commencing this study, we conducted familiarisation sessions with the assessors to ensure proper and standardised execution of testing procedures.

Return to sports decision

The treating sports medicine physician saw our participants for a final return to sports assessment after they completed their return to sport examinations by the blinded assessor. A decision-based return to sport model was used by the sports medicine physicians as a guideline. This model included several elements such as the consideration of medical factors. An example of a medical factor would be the successful and asymptomatic completion of one of the rehabilitation protocols. In keeping with this model, the final decision was guided by these medical factors but also included consideration of sport risk modifiers and decision modifiers. Participants were advised to gradually return to match play.

### Early versus delayed lengthening exercises for acute hamstring injury in male athletes: a randomised controlled clinical trial [^116Fib2L]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Other outcomes

With similar outcomes of return to sport times and reinjury rates being achieved across recent RCTs, other outcomes during rehabilitation have become increasingly important. For example, some RCTs have focused more on performance-based outcomes (eg, sprint performance)or on the recovery of strength and changing muscle architecture. Similar to the intervention group of the RCT by Hickey et al, our early lengthening group had significantly greater eccentric strength at return to sport than our delayed lengthening group. However, this finding must be interpreted with caution and placed in its proper context: none of the other variables presented in online supplemental table S4 were statistically significantly different between the groups. We cannot exclude that this was an incidental finding. Larger samples may seek to establish if these changes are associated with any alterations in reinjury risk.

We did not describe exacerbation of pain during rehabilitation as a variable in our protocol. However, due to its possible clinical importance and effect on return to sport, we recorded and reported it descriptively for completeness. We found no significant difference in exacerbations of pain between the groups, nor any of the remaining outcomes at return to sport (see online supplemental table S4). As far as we are aware, this is the first time this has been reported in a hamstring rehabilitation RCT. Consensus needs to be achieved on what constitutes an exacerbation and its nomenclature (eg, any increase in pain? Or a clinical/radiological worsening of the injury during rehabilitation?). In this study, our net was cast wide and included all of the above.

Loss to follow-up

For the primary outcome, we had a loss to follow-up rate of 19%, which was more than our predicted 10%. Reasons for this loss to follow-up rate included participants leaving the country, compulsory military duty, work-related drop-out or being unhappy with progression (see online supplemental table S1). However, in most cases we do not know the reason for loss to follow-up as, despite repeated attempts, we were not able to make contact. This rate is higher than a previous study at the same centre. A possible explanation for this could be a form of self-selection bias, as the previous study offered the possibility of a platelet-rich plasma injection.

### Determinants of return to play after the nonoperative management of hamstring injuries in athletes: a systematic review [^112zQn69]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

It is important for clinicians to rely on suitable prognosis factors after hamstring injuries because of the high incidence of these injuries and time away from athletic activities.

Purpose

To summarize the current literature on factors that influence return to play after a hamstring injury in athletes.

Study Design

Systematic review.

Methods

A computer-assisted literature search of CINAHL, MEDLINE, Embase, and EBM Reviews databases (and a manual search of the reference lists of all selected articles) was conducted using keywords related to hamstring injuries and return to play. The literature review criteria included (1) patients with an acute hamstring or posterior thigh injury; (2) a randomized controlled trial, cohort study, case-control study, case series, or prospective or retrospective design; (3) information on rehabilitation, physical therapy, clinical assessment, imaging techniques, and return to play; and (4) studies written in English or French.

Results

The search strategy identified 914 potential articles, of which 24 met the inclusion criteria. In terms of the clinical assessment, the following factors were associated with a longer recovery time: stretching-type injuries, recreational-level sports, structural versus functional injuries, greater range of motion deficit with the hip flexed at 90°, time to first consultation > 1 week, increased pain on the visual analog scale, and > 1 day to be able to walk pain free after the injury. As for magnetic resonance imaging studies, the following factors correlated with a longer recovery time: positive findings; higher grade of injury; muscle involvement > 75%; complete transection; retraction; central tendon disruption of the biceps femoris; proximal tendon involvement; shorter distance to the ischial tuberosity; length of the hamstring injury; and depth, volume, and large cross-sectional area. With respect to ultrasound studies, the following factors were associated with a poor prognosis: large cross-sectional area, injury outside the musculotendinous junction, hematoma, structural injury, and injury involving the biceps femoris. Lastly, rehabilitation approaches that included hamstring loading during extensive lengthening or 4 daily sessions of static hamstring stretching led to shorter rehabilitation times.

Conclusion

Numerous determinants have an effect on return to play after a hamstring injury in athletes. It is important for sports professionals to be aware of those determinants to guide athletes through the rehabilitation process and refine return-to-play strategies.

Important considerations when designing an injury prevention programme in elite football

Why do HSIs happen? Risk factor analysis and programme planning

To prevent HSIs, it is important to understand why they occur, so that an appropriate intervention can be developed, targeted at the specific risk factors. Importantly, there is not a clear understanding of why HSIs happen. Although there is a wealth of research examining HSI risk factors, there is a lack of evidence reporting consistent prospective risk factors for HSIs, and also a lack of research examining how the supposed risk factors interact with one another. Despite the difficulties of studying the interactions of multiple risk factors, it appears that risk factors do not operate in isolation, but instead function as a complex web of determinants. As such, our first approach when designing an HSI prevention programme is to consider all the possible risk factors which may be implicated, blending theory, evidence and anecdotal experiences (see figure 1).

A diagram of factors to consider in hamstring muscle injury prevention. CV, cardiovascular.

Table 1 depicts the approach of our practitioners when considering the contents of the programme. It contains the list of risk factors linked in some way to HSIs, either through prospective or retrospective research studies, or from anecdotal evidence from within our group. Clearly, when designing a programme, one cannot specifically target every possible risk factor or assign equal weight to all risk factors. Instead, it is essential to rank the factors in order of importance considering both specific and general risk. This is by no means an exhaustive list, nor do we suggest that any of the risk factors displayed are permanently associated with the table category (eg, acute:chronic workload ratio (ACWR) could in some cases be moved to any of the other categories depending on the overall factors presented by the player). In our experience, those risk factors presented in the 'Recognised but does not inform normal practice' category are explored in more complex/detailed cases of preventing HSI. Multidisciplinary team-mediated player discussion in preseason serves to inform an individual's programme design and resource allocation.

### Imaging of hamstring injuries: therapeutic implications [^111ykpdh]. European Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Though recent research into the diagnosis and management of hamstring disorders has resulted in early and accurate recognition of injury, hamstring strain remains the most common form of muscle injury in the active population. With prompt recognition of hamstring strain, an appropriate rest and rehabilitation routine may be devised by the sports clinician in the hope of avoiding future and possibly more debilitating injury. As such, imaging has played a pivotal role in assisting athletes, both elite and recreational, in returning to activity expeditiously.

### Rationale, secondary outcome scores and 1-year follow-up of a randomised trial of platelet-rich plasma injections in acute hamstring muscle injury: the Dutch hamstring injection therapy study [^1147uPvW]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections are an experimental treatment for acute muscle injuries. We examined whether PRP injections would accelerate return to play after hamstring injury. The methods and the primary outcome measure were published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) as 'Platelet-rich plasma injections in acute muscle injury' (2014). This article shares information not available in the NEJM letter or online supplement, especially the rationale behind the study and the secondary outcome measures including 1 year re-injury data.

Methods

We performed a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 80 competitive and recreational athletes with acute hamstring muscle injuries. Details can be found in the NEJM (http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1402340). The primary outcome measure was the time needed to return to play during 6 months of follow-up. Not previously reported secondary outcome scores included re-injury at 1 year, alteration in clinical and MRI parameters, subjective patient satisfaction and the hamstring outcome score.

Results

In the earlier NEJM publication, we reported that PRP did not accelerate return to play; nor did we find a difference in the 2-month re-injury rate. We report no significant between-group difference in the 1-year re-injury rate (HR = 0.89; 95% CI, 0.38 to 2.13; p = 0.80) or any other secondary outcome measure.

Conclusions

At 1-year postinjection, we found no benefit of intramuscular PRP compared with placebo injections in patients with acute hamstring injuries in the time to return to play, re-injury rate and alterations of subjective, clinical or MRI measures.

### Interventions for the management of acute and chronic low back pain: revision 2021 [^115S6KHT]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2021). High credibility.

Chronic low back pain (LBP) — soft tissue mobilization — Six RCTs were identified, and none of these studies conducted a long-term follow-up. Two RCTs comparing myofascial release to sham found greater short-term improvement in pain and disability with myofascial release. Another RCT comparing myofascial release plus thrust mobilization to thrust alone found no significant between-group differences. An RCT comparing three techniques (manual pressure release, strain/counterstrain, integrated neuromuscular inhibition) each with a home exercise program to home exercise alone found the group receiving strain/counterstrain had slightly greater improvement in pain and disability. In young adults (age, 20–35 years), dynamic soft tissue mobilization of the hamstring was more effective than stretching for short-term pain reduction. Finally, one RCT comparing four trunk activation–based groups, including added nonthrust mobilization and soft tissue mobilization, elastic taping, or reflexology, found no differences between groups in pain or disability at 4-week follow-up.

### Evidence-based hamstring injury prevention and risk factor management: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114uLorW]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Hamstring injuries are common among athletes. Considering the potentially prolonged recovery and high rate of recurrence, effective methods of prevention and risk factor management are of great interest to athletes, trainers, coaches, and therapists, with substantial competitive and financial implications.

Purpose

To systematically review the literature concerning evidence-based hamstring training and quantitatively assess the effectiveness of training programs in (1) reducing injury incidence and (2) managing injury risk factors.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis; Level of evidence, 1.

Methods

A computerized search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and SPORTDiscus with manual screening of selected reference lists was performed in October 2020. Randomized controlled trials investigating methods of hamstring injury prevention and risk factor management in recreational, semiprofessional, and professional adult athletes were included.

Results

Of 2602 articles identified, 108 were included. Eccentric training reduced the incidence of hamstring injury by 56.8% to 70.0%. Concentric hamstring strength increased with eccentric (mean difference [MD], 14.29 N·m; 95% CI, 8.53–20.05 N·m), concentric, blood flow-restricted, whole-body vibration, heavy back squat, FIFA 11+ (Fédération Internationale de Football Association), and plyometric training methods, whereas eccentric strength benefited from eccentric (MD, 26.94 N·m; 95% CI, 15.59–38.30 N·m), concentric, and plyometric training. Static stretching produced greater flexibility gains (MD, 10.89°; 95% CI, 8.92°-12.86°) than proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (MD, 9.73°; 95% CI, 6.53°-12.93°) and dynamic stretching (MD, 6.25°; 95% CI, 2.84°-9.66°), although the effects of static techniques were more transient. Fascicle length increased with eccentric (MD, 0.90 cm; 95% CI, 0.53–1.27 cm) and sprint training and decreased with concentric training. Although the conventional hamstring/quadriceps (H/Q) ratio was unchanged (MD, 0.03; 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.06), the functional H/Q ratio significantly improved with eccentric training (MD, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.03–0.16). In addition, eccentric training reduced limb strength asymmetry, while H/Q ratio and flexibility imbalances were normalized via resistance training and static stretching.

Conclusion

Several strategies exist to prevent hamstring injury and address known risk factors. Eccentric strengthening reduces injury incidence and improves hamstring strength, fascicle length, H/Q ratio, and limb asymmetry, while stretching-based interventions can be implemented to improve flexibility. These results provide valuable insights to athletes, trainers, coaches, and therapists seeking to optimize hamstring training and prevent injury.

### Hamstring muscle strain injuries: what can we learn from history? [^1168vQ9B]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Hamstring muscle strains have been recognised as a significant injury for over 100 years. Remarkably, by the mid-20th century, the foundations for our current management strategies were well established. Furthermore, despite the remarkable advances of the past 30 years, we have made only incremental progress in our understanding and management of this complex injury. The history of hamstring injury management is characterised by interventions which over time have failed to become established, typically without evidence ever being produced either for, or against their application. Most novel treatment interventions currently used continue to lack scientific validity; if we are to avoid repeating past mistakes, we must take up the challenge of obtaining high-quality data. To achieve this, we must challenge dogma that underpins 'usual care' and subject all elements of our management strategies to scientific scrutiny.

There is now evidence to use MRI to distinguish MRI-positive and MRI-negative injuries as these have a distinct prognoses and treatments. However, whether MRI or US aids in predicting of prognosis beyond this distinction remains to be determined. Minimising acute inflammation and optimising regeneration remain key goals in hamstring injury management; current techniques having changed little in 40 years and the medical manipulation of these pathophysiological processes warrants further clinical and laboratory research (eg, role of PRP). Finally, the development of scar tissue appears related to recurrent injuries and poor outcomes. Recently identified techniques for inhibition of growth factors involved in the development of scar tissue present an exciting development, but require further high-quality clinical trials in order to establish themselves in the standard management of muscle injuries.

To progress, we must encourage communication among (I) the proponents of published evidence-based, clinical guidelines, (II) those practitioners overtly working outside the recognised scientific evidence base and applying novel therapies based on their personal experience and (III) those researchers able to test novel hypotheses. Typically, these groups have not interacted, likely to the detriment of the profession and patients. We are at the start of the specialist era in Sports and Exercise Medicine, and maintaining status quo is unacceptable. For the credibility of all clinicians in the field of sports injury management, it is vital to accumulate appropriate evidence to progress from the scientific baseline established by our forbearers in the mid-20th century.
