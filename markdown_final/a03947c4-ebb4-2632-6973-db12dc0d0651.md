## Question

most common presenting symptoms in mast cell activation syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most common presenting symptoms in mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic framework that defines which symptoms count toward MCAS. Then, I should verify which organ systems are most frequently involved and which symptoms within those systems are most prevalent. Next, I will examine comparative data on frequency across studies and reconcile any discrepancies. After that, I should consider differences by MCAS subtype and the role of triggers. Finally, I will synthesize a ranked list of the most common symptoms and note limitations and caveats so we don't overgeneralize.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework so I don't misattribute symptoms. MCAS is defined by episodic symptoms involving at least two organ systems, with objective evidence of mast cell mediator release (classically a tryptase rise of 20% + 2 ng/mL over baseline) and a clinical response to mediator-directed therapy; persistent single-organ symptoms or isolated fatigue/pain without corroborating mediator evidence should not be labeled MCAS, which helps anchor which "presenting symptoms" truly reflect the syndrome rather than nonspecific complaints [^bb33b47c] [^82f78f81] [^db14536b].

> I will now examine the core organ systems implicated in MCAS. Consensus statements consistently cluster symptoms into four domains: dermatologic, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and respiratory; neurologic and neuropsychiatric symptoms are frequently reported but are not part of the formal diagnostic organ-system criteria, so I need to keep that distinction clear as I interpret prevalence data [^4fa90f3b] [^bb33b47c].

> Next, I should review which symptoms within each system are most common. Dermatologic manifestations include flushing, pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema; gastrointestinal symptoms include diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and crampy abdominal pain; cardiovascular features include hypotension, tachycardia, and syncope or near-syncope; respiratory features include wheeze, dyspnea, and inspiratory stridor; neurologic complaints often include headache, cognitive fog, and paresthesias, though these are not required for diagnosis [^4fa90f3b] [^bb33b47c] [^480634f7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about frequency without data. I should double-check comparative studies. In a prospective cohort of 18 patients with MCAS, abdominal pain occurred in 94%, dermatographism in 89%, flushing in 89%, and diarrhea in 72%, suggesting that abdominal pain, flushing, and dermatographism are among the most prevalent symptoms in that series; however, this is a small, single-center cohort, so I need to be cautious about generalizability [^9bcd08ec]. In a larger retrospective series of 703 patients evaluated for suspected MCAS, mucocutaneous symptoms — particularly urticaria or angioedema — were the most common presentation during episodes in idiopathic MCAS, which aligns with the dermatologic cluster being prominent in iMCAS presentations [^290458ba]. In a prospective real-life study of 100 patients with suspected MCAS, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain/weakness, and abdominal pain were the most frequently reported symptoms, but only 2% ultimately met MCAS criteria, underscoring that many nonspecific symptoms are common in referrals yet not specific to MCAS; I should not conflate these referral-biased frequencies with true MCAS symptom prevalence [^987925fe].

> Wait, let me verify the role of triggers and episodicity, because that shapes which symptoms patients actually present with during attacks. Common triggers include hymenoptera stings, alcohol, heat, sudden temperature changes, exercise, stress, certain foods, and medications such as NSAIDs, opioids, and antibiotics; symptoms are typically episodic and multisystem during attacks, which explains why flushing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, pruritus, urticaria, tachycardia, and hypotension are frequently reported at presentation [^30720c49] [^34ac9685].

> I need to ensure I distinguish subtypes, because symptom patterns may vary. In idiopathic MCAS, mucocutaneous symptoms such as urticaria or angioedema are especially prominent, whereas in clonal MCAS (monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome), anaphylaxis and cardiovascular collapse may predominate; this helps explain why different series emphasize different leading symptoms depending on the population studied [^290458ba] [^678ad9ea].

> Let me synthesize a cautious ranking, keeping the evidence limitations in mind. Based on consensus criteria and the best available series, the most common presenting symptoms in MCAS are: flushing, pruritus, urticaria or angioedema, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, tachycardia, hypotension or syncope, wheeze or dyspnea, and headache or cognitive fog; fatigue and musculoskeletal pain are very common in referrals but are nonspecific and should not be used to diagnose MCAS in the absence of mediator evidence and multisystem involvement [^4fa90f3b] [^9bcd08ec] [^290458ba] [^987925fe].

> But wait, what if the patient reports only one system involved or has chronic symptoms without attacks? I should confirm that such presentations do not meet MCAS criteria and that other diagnoses should be prioritized; chronic urticaria, IBS, anxiety disorders, and autonomic dysfunction can mimic aspects of MCAS, and overdiagnosis is a recognized pitfall when relying on symptom checklists without corroborating mediator data and response to therapy [^bb33b47c] [^e34ad408] [^471e235e] [^68b29b58].

> In summary, after reviewing the diagnostic framework and the most relevant clinical series, the most common presenting symptoms in MCAS are episodic flushing, pruritus, urticaria or angioedema, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, tachycardia, hypotension or near-syncope, wheeze or dyspnea, and headache or cognitive fog, typically occurring in combination across at least two organ systems during attacks and often triggered by identifiable stimuli; I should emphasize that objective mediator confirmation and response to antimediator therapy are required to substantiate the diagnosis and avoid misattribution of nonspecific symptoms [^4fa90f3b] [^bb33b47c] [^30720c49].

The most common presenting symptoms of mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) are **flushing, pruritus, and urticaria/angioedema** [^4fa90f3b] of the skin; **abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea/vomiting** [^671b5baa] of the gastrointestinal tract; and **tachycardia, hypotension, and syncope** [^4fa90f3b] of the cardiovascular system. Respiratory symptoms such as wheezing and dyspnea are also frequent [^4fa90f3b], and neurologic complaints like headache and cognitive fog are common but less specific [^480634f7]. These symptoms are typically episodic, multisystem, and triggered by factors such as heat, stress, alcohol, or certain foods [^30720c49]; **objective mediator elevation (especially tryptase)** [^bb33b47c] and response to antimediator therapy support the diagnosis [^82f78f81].

---

## Cutaneous symptoms

Cutaneous manifestations are among the most frequent and recognizable in MCAS, including:

- **Flushing**: Episodic, often triggered by heat, stress, alcohol, or certain foods [^30720c49].

- **Pruritus**: Generalized itching, frequently associated with flushing [^85282829].

- **Urticaria and angioedema**: Recurrent wheals and localized swelling, often without identifiable allergens [^4fa90f3b].

- **Dermatographism**: Skin writing or exaggerated wheal formation after minor friction [^85282829].

---

## Gastrointestinal symptoms

Gastrointestinal symptoms are very common and often debilitating in MCAS, including:

- **Abdominal pain**: Crampy, episodic, and often severe [^4fa90f3b].

- **Diarrhea**: Frequent, watery stools, sometimes with urgency [^671b5baa].

- **Nausea and vomiting**: Episodic and often associated with abdominal pain [^4fa90f3b].

- **Bloating and cramping**: Common and often responsive to antimediator therapy [^d0416b82].

---

## Cardiovascular symptoms

Cardiovascular involvement is common in MCAS and may be severe, including:

- **Tachycardia**: Episodic palpitations and elevated heart rate [^4fa90f3b].

- **Hypotension**: Orthostatic or episodic drops in blood pressure [^4fa90f3b].

- **Syncope or near-syncope**: Often related to hypotension and vasodilation [^4fa90f3b].

---

## Respiratory symptoms

Respiratory symptoms are frequent and can be life-threatening in severe cases, including:

- **Wheezing and bronchospasm**: Often episodic and triggered by exposures [^4fa90f3b].

- **Dyspnea**: Shortness of breath, sometimes with chest tightness [^4fa90f3b].

- **Nasal congestion and rhinorrhea**: Less specific but commonly reported [^notfound].

---

## Neurologic and neuropsychiatric symptoms

Neurologic and neuropsychiatric symptoms are common but less specific, including:

- **Headache**: Including migraines, often episodic [^480634f7].

- **Cognitive fog**: Difficulty concentrating, memory issues, and mental cloudiness [^480634f7].

- **Fatigue and malaise**: Persistent or episodic, often debilitating [^987925fe].

---

## Frequency and pattern of symptoms

Symptoms in MCAS are typically **episodic**, multisystem, and triggered by identifiable factors such as heat, stress, alcohol, certain foods, medications, or insect stings [^30720c49]. The severity and frequency of symptoms vary widely among patients, and symptom clusters often overlap, making the clinical presentation highly heterogeneous [^ee228c8f].

### Mast cell activation syndrome: current understanding and research needs [^4349b797]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) is a term applied to several clinical entities that have gained increased attention from patients and medical providers. Although several descriptive publications about MCAS exist, there are many gaps in knowledge, resulting in confusion about this clinical syndrome. Whether MCAS is a primary syndrome or exists as a constellation of symptoms in the context of known inflammatory, allergic, or clonal disorders associated with systemic mast cell activation is not well understood. More importantly, the underlying mechanisms and pathways that lead to mast cell activation in MCAS patients remain to be elucidated. Here we summarize the known literature, identify gaps in knowledge, and highlight research needs. Covered topics include contextualization of MCAS and MCAS-like endotypes and related diagnostic evaluations; mechanistic research; management of typical and refractory symptoms; and MCAS-specific education for patients and health care providers.

### Mast cell activation syndrome: proposed diagnostic criteria [^c3e62051]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

The term mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) is finding increasing use as a diagnosis for subjects who present with signs and symptoms involving the dermis, gastrointestinal track, and cardiovascular system frequently accompanied by neurologic complaints. Such patients often have undergone multiple extensive medical evaluations by different physicians in varied disciplines without a definitive medical diagnosis until the diagnosis of MCAS is applied. However, MCAS as a distinct clinical entity has not been generally accepted, nor do there exist definitive criteria for diagnosis. Based on current understanding of this disease "syndrome" and on what we do know about mast cell activation and resulting pathology, we will explore and propose criteria for its diagnosis. The proposed criteria will be discussed in the context of other disorders involving mast cells or with similar presentations and as a basis for further scientific study and validation.

### Mast cell activation syndromes [^ee228c8f]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Mast cell activation is common and possibly necessary for maintenance of survival. Disordered mast cell activation occurs when mast cells are pathologically overproduced or if their activation is out of proportion to the perceived threat to homeostasis. Mast cell activation syndrome refers to a group of disorders with diverse causes presenting with episodic multisystem symptoms as the result of mast cell mediator release. Despite introduction of diagnostic criteria and some advances in treatment in the last decade, many areas of mast cell activation syndrome are in need of research. This article reviews our current knowledge about the various types of mast cell activation disorders, their treatment, and areas of uncertainty in need of future investigation.

### A review of the dermatologic symptoms of idiopathic mast cell activation syndrome [^85282829]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Since the first reported cases in 2007, idiopathic mast cell activation syndrome has been increasingly recognized. Understanding of the cutaneous manifestations of this condition is imperative for dermatologists given the substantial clinical heterogeneity in its presentation and high estimated prevalence. A review of PubMed® and SCOPUS® databases was performed in order to investigate the most common dermatologic manifestations of idiopathic mast cell activation syndrome. Evidence to date suggests that flushing, pruritus, and clotting dysfunction or bleeding disorder are the most frequently observed dermatologic symptoms in idiopathic mast cell activation syndrome, while dermatographism has been identified as a common finding in patients as well. Mast cell activation syndromes have also been linked to connective tissue disorders, including an Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome-like phenotype possibly mediated by matrix metalloproteinases and tryptase released by mast cells. Current literature regarding dermatologic manifestations of idiopathic mast cell activation syndrome is limited by the heterogeneity of studies including clinical descriptions, inconsistency of diagnostic criteria implemented, and a paucity of literature available. This work provides a guide for dermatologists to strengthen diagnostic acuity for idiopathic mast cell activation syndrome, therefore contributing toward a goal of helping patients to receive timely, effective, and targeted therapy.

### How to evaluate the patient with a suspected mast cell disorder and how / when to manage symptoms [^1e3cabe3]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2022). Medium credibility.

Mast cell disorders include mastocytosis and mast cell activation syndromes. Mastocytosis is a rare clonal disorder of the mast cell, driven by KIT D816V mutation in most cases. Mastocytosis is diagnosed and classified according to World Health Organization criteria. Mast cell activation syndromes encompass a diverse group of disorders and may have clonal or nonclonal etiologies. Hematologists may be consulted to assist in the diagnostic workup and/or management of mast cell disorders. A consult to the hematologist for mast cell disorders may provoke anxiety due to the rare nature of these diseases and the management of nonhematologic mast cell activation symptoms. This article presents recommendations on how to approach the diagnosis and management of patients referred for common clinical scenarios.

### Selecting the right criteria and proper classification to diagnose mast cell activation syndromes: a critical review [^e34ad408]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

In recent years, knowledge about mechanisms underlying mast cell activation (MCA) and accumulation in various pathologic conditions increased substantially. In addition, criteria and a classification of MCA syndromes (MCASs) have been set forth. MCAS is defined by typical clinical symptoms, a substantial increase in serum tryptase level during an attack over the patient's baseline tryptase, and a response of the symptoms to drugs targeting mast cells, mediator production, and/or mediator effects. Alternative diagnostic criteria of MCAS have also been suggested, but these alternative criteria often lack specificity and validation. In this report, we critically review the contemporary literature relating to MCAS and compare the specificity, sensitivity, and strength of MCAS-related parameters within proposals to diagnose and classify MCAS and its variants. Furthermore, we highlight the need to apply specific consensus criteria in the evaluation and classification of MCAS in individual patients. This is an urgent and important medical necessity because as an increasing number of patients are being given a misdiagnosis of MCAS based on nonspecific criteria, which contributes to confusion and frustration by patients and caregivers and sometimes may delay recognition and treatment of correct medical conditions that often turn out to be unrelated to MCA.

### Proposed diagnostic algorithm for patients with suspected mast cell activation syndrome [^16b9c86c]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Mast cell activation (MCA) accompanies diverse physiologic and pathologic processes and is one of the more frequently encountered conditions in medicine. MCA-related symptoms are usually mild and often transient. In such cases, histamine receptor blockers and other mediator-targeting drugs can usually control MCA. In severe cases, an MCA syndrome (MCAS) may be diagnosed. However, overt MCAS is an unusual condition, and many patients referred because of suspected MCAS are diagnosed with other diseases (autoimmune, neoplastic, or infectious) unrelated to MCA or suffer from MCA-related (eg, allergic) disorders and/or comorbidities without fulfilling criteria of an overt MCAS. These considerations are important as more and more patients are informed that they may have MCA or even MCAS without completing a thorough medical evaluation. In fact, in several instances, symptoms are misinterpreted as MCA/MCAS, and other clinically relevant conditions are not thoroughly pursued. The number of such referrals is increasing. To avoid such unnecessary referrals and to prevent misdiagnoses, we here propose a diagnostic algorithm through which a clinically relevant (systemic) MCA can be suspected and MCAS can subsequently be documented or excluded. In addition, the algorithm proposed should help guide the investigating care providers to consider the 2 principal diagnoses that may underlie MCAS, namely, severe allergy and systemic mastocytosis accompanied by severe MCA. Although validation is required, we anticipate that this algorithm will facilitate the management of patients with suspected MCAS.

### Diagnostic criteria and classification of mastocytosis in 2014 [^d9870ae6]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Mastocytosis is characterized by accumulation of pathologic mast cells in tissues. Most patients with mastocytosis experience mast cell activation symptoms in response to various triggers. The diagnosis of mastocytosis should be made from objective pathologic findings. Modern diagnostic criteria and classification of mastocytosis were proposed in 2000 by an international consensus group and formed the basis of the current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, which have been validated to correlate with prognosis and help selection of therapy. In this article, the WHO criteria for diagnosis and classification are summarized and practical aspects to avoid common pitfalls in diagnostic workup are discussed.

### Mast cell activation syndromes presenting as anaphylaxis [^678ad9ea]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis results from severe systemic mast cell activation. In addition to IgE-mediated and physical triggers, it may occur with a clonal mast cell disease and in an idiopathic fashion without clear provoking factors. Disorders of mast cell activation are classified into primary (clonal), secondary, and idiopathic. Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) is a multisystem disorder characterized by objective documentation of elevated mast cell mediators during attacks and a favorable response to antimediator therapy. It should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with recurrent anaphylaxis without a clear cause. This article discusses the diagnosis of MCAS.

AAAAI Mast Cell Disorders Committee Work Group Report — mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) diagnosis and management states that current recommendations for diagnosing and treating primary mast cell (MC) activation syndrome make use of the latest studies and consensus guidelines for clinically recognizing systemic anaphylaxis in real time, incorporate understanding of biomarkers that discriminate this disorder from other conditions, and consider therapeutic drugs that might selectively affect those mediators or MCs themselves. The report adds that finding familial or somatic mutations that cause MCs to be hyperactivated would extend diagnostic tools and potentially indicate new therapeutic interventions targeting the mutated gene product or associated pathway. The authors state that they trust that the clinical, laboratory, and therapeutic criteria for primary MC activation syndromes described will provide clinicians with practical criteria of sufficient sensitivity. The document notes that these AAAAI reports are not to be considered to reflect current AAAAI standards or policy after five years from the date of publication.

### Mast cell activation syndromes: definition and classification [^8257be87]. Allergy (2013). Low credibility.

Mast cell activation (MCA) occurs in a number of different clinical conditions, including IgE-dependent allergies, other inflammatory reactions, and mastocytosis. MCA-related symptoms may be mild, moderate, severe, or even life-threatening. The severity of MCA depends on a number of different factors, including genetic predisposition, the number and releasability of mast cells involved in the reaction, the type of allergen, presence of specific IgE, and presence of certain comorbidities. In severe reactions, MCA can be documented by a substantial increase in the serum tryptase level above baseline. When symptoms are recurrent, are accompanied by an increase in mast cell-derived mediators in biological fluids, and are responsive to treatment with mast cell-stabilizing or mediator-targeting drugs, the diagnosis of mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) is appropriate. Based on the underlying condition, these patients can further be classified into i) primary MCAS where KIT-mutated, clonal mast cells are detected, ii) secondary MCAS where an underlying inflammatory disease, often in the form of an IgE-dependent allergy, but no KIT-mutated mast cells, is found, and iii) idiopathic MCAS, where neither an allergy or other underlying disease, nor KIT-mutated mast cells are detectable. It is important to note that in many patients with MCAS, several different factors act together to lead to severe or even life-threatening anaphylaxis. Detailed knowledge about the pathogenesis and complexity of MCAS, and thus establishing the exact final diagnosis, may greatly help in the management and therapy of these patients.

The current consensus diagnostic criteria for mast cell activation syndrome(s) (MCAS[s]) were first established in 2012 and updated in 2019. This diagnosis has been attached to multiple medical conditions not intended as part of the diagnosis. In this article, the diagnostic criteria are reviewed and other diseases in the differential diagnosis outlined. The goal of this review is to provide a tool for evaluation of patients with conditions that can mimic MCAS.

Patients who present with typical features of mast cell activation with laboratory confirmation and without evidence of a clonal mast cell disorder or other medical condition should be initiated on medical treatment to block mast cells and their mediators. If a major response is achieved, a diagnosis of nonclonal mast cell activation syndrome (NC-MCAS) is likely and treatment should be optimized, including management of any associated conditions. In this review, the latest evidence with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of NC-MCAS is presented.

### AAAAI mast cell disorders committee work group report: mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) diagnosis and management [^9e0b4d40]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Our current recommendations for diagnosing and treating primary mast cell (MC) activation syndrome make use of the latest studies and consensus guidelines for clinically recognizing systemic anaphylaxis in real time, regardless of whether allergen-triggered or other pathways are involved; our current understanding of the biomarkers secreted by activated MCs that best discriminate this disorder from other conditions; and the therapeutic drugs that might selectively affect those mediators or MCs themselves. Finding familial or somatic mutations of genes that cause MCs to be hyperactivatable would extend our diagnostic tools and potentially indicate new therapeutic interventions, targeting either the mutated gene product or the associated molecular pathway. In conclusion, we trust that the clinical, laboratory, and therapeutic criteria for primary MC activation syndromes described herein will provide clinicians with practical criteria of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to diagnose most cases without overdiagnosing the disorder in patients who likely have other conditions.

### Mast cell activation disorders [^18e39442]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Disorders associated with mast cell activation range from relatively common IgE-mediated disease and chronic urticaria to rarer conditions such as mastocytosis or monoclonal mast cell activation disorder. Mast cell activation disorders can be mechanistically classified into primary (associated with abnormal production of mast cells that carry pathologic markers of clonality), secondary (normal mast cells activated in reaction to a microenvironmental trigger), and idiopathic (no etiology is found). Clinical presentations, diagnostic criteria as well as general principles of a stepwise therapy approach are discussed.

### A practical guide for treatment of pain in patients with systemic mast cell activation disease [^a2a4a19f]. Pain Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Systemic mast cell activation disease (MCAD, a subclass of mastocytosis), which has a prevalence of around 17% (at least in the German population), is characterized by accumulation of genetically altered dysfunctional mast cells with abnormal release of these cells' mediators. Since mast cells affect functions in potentially every organ system, often without causing abnormalities in routine laboratory or radiologic testing, this disease has to be considered routinely in the differential diagnosis of patients with chronic multisystem polymorbidity of a generally inflammatory and allergic theme. Pain in its different manifestations is a common symptom in MCAD found in more than three-quarters of the MCAD patients. Because of the specific mast cell-related causes of pain in MCAD it should be treated specifically, if possible, deduced from their putative mast cell mediator-related causes. As yet, there is no official guideline for treatment of MCAD at all. The present review focuses on mast cell mediator-induced acute and chronic pain and the current state of analgesic drug therapy options in MCAD. Due to the high prevalence of MCAD, many physicians are often faced with the issue of pain management in MCAD patients. Hence, our practical guide should contribute to the improvement of patient care. Key words: Pain therapy, mast cell activation disease, mast cell activation syndrome, systemic mastocytosis, mast cell.

### Mast cell activation syndrome and mastocytosis: initial treatment options and long-term management [^644aa8da]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients with clonal mast cell activation syndromes (MCAS) including cutaneous and systemic mastocytosis (SM) may present with symptoms of mast cell activation, but in addition can have organ damage from the local effects of tissue infiltration by clonal mast cells. Patients with nonclonal MCAS may have chronic or episodic mast cell activation symptoms with an increase in serum tryptase and/or urinary metabolites of histamine, prostaglandin D2, and leukotrienes. Symptoms of MCAS and SM can be managed by blockade of mediator receptors (H1 and H2 antihistamines, leukotriene receptor blockade), inhibition of mediator synthesis (aspirin, zileuton), mediator release (sodium cromolyn), anti-IgE therapy, or a combination of these approaches. Acute episodes of mast cell activation require epinephrine, and prolonged episodes may be addressed with corticosteroids. Patients with clonal mast cell syndromes may need a reduction in the number of mast cells to prevent severe symptoms including anaphylaxis and/or progression to aggressive diseases.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: systemic mastocytosis, version 3.2024 [^82f78f81]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) — definition, scope, and basic criteria: MCAS refers to disorders with episodic symptoms related to mast cell mediator release and can be divided into primary, secondary, and idiopathic. Primary MCAS is also called monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome (MMAS). MCAS is not considered a subtype of systemic mastocytosis and is not associated with an overproliferation of cells or a prediagnostic condition that progresses to SM, though mediator symptoms may still occur. Basic defining criteria include: 1) episodic symptoms consistent with mast cell mediator release affecting greater than or equal to two organ systems; 2) a decrease in the frequency or severity, or resolution of symptoms with anti-mediator drug therapy; and 3) elevation of a validated urinary or serum marker of mast cell activation, such as serum tryptase (marker of choice). In patients with mast cell activation symptoms but normal mast cell morphology/immunophenotype without KIT D816V, other causes of mast cell activation should be considered, and if no cause is identified, a diagnosis of idiopathic MCAS is rendered on a provisional basis until a specific cause is found.

### AAAAI mast cell disorders committee work group report: mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) diagnosis and management [^bb33b47c]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2019). High credibility.

Diagnosis of MCAS: clinical signs, biomarker criteria, and evaluation — MCAS is a diagnosis that should be entertained in patients with an appropriate clinical and laboratory profile when other conditions have been excluded; a key feature is recurrent episodes of systemic anaphylaxis with concurrent involvement of at least 2 of the 4 organ systems listed below. The clinical symptoms have to be associated with an acute increase in specific biologic mediator levels, and patients should respond to therapy with mast cell mediator blocking agents, mast cell stabilizers, or both, with the most validated mediators including histamine, PGD2, and LTC4 and metabolites (with tryptase) serving as biomarkers for mast cell activation. A patient with episodic symptoms affecting 2 or more organ systems should be evaluated for MCAS, and the evaluation should include measuring mediator levels at baseline and during an acute episode; if only urinary histamine products are increased, histamine-blocking agents might improve symptoms, whereas if PG levels are increased, aspirin (with appropriate precautions discussed later in the article) will reduce PG levels and should alleviate symptoms. The presence of the specific symptom during which levels of a mediator are increased and the clinical response to appropriate therapy are prerequisites for the diagnosis of MCAS. Persistent symptoms, such as in chronic urticaria or poorly controlled asthma, should direct the clinician to a different underlying diagnosis, and chronic increases in mediator levels such as tryptase might reflect underlying systemic mastocytosis or hereditary α-tryptasemia that can be but are not always associated with MCAS.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: systemic mastocytosis, version 3.2024 [^0bbec724]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) encompasses disorders with episodic symptoms related to mast cell mediator release and can be divided into primary, secondary, and idiopathic, with primary MCAS also referred to as monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome (MMAS). MCAS is not considered a subtype of SM, and basic defining criteria include episodic symptoms consistent with mast cell mediator release affecting greater than or equal to two organ systems, improvement with anti‑mediator drug therapy, and elevation of a validated urinary or serum marker of mast cell activation such as serum tryptase. In symptomatic patients with normal mast cell morphology/immunophenotype without KIT D816V, other causes of mast cell activation should be considered, and if no cause is identified, idiopathic MCAS is rendered on a provisional basis until a specific cause is found.

Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) diagnostic symptom clusters — anaphylaxis organ system involvement is summarized across four systems, and symptoms affecting at least 2 of these 4 organ systems should occur concurrently. Cardiovascular involvement includes hypotension, tachycardia, and syncope or near syncope. Respiratory involvement includes wheezing (inspiratory or expiratory), shortness of breath, and inspiratory stridor. Dermatologic involvement includes flushing, urticaria, pruritus, and angioedema. Gastrointestinal involvement includes diarrhea, nausea with vomiting, and crampy abdominal pain.

### Gastrointestinal involvement in mast cell activation disorders [^671b5baa]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are commonly reported in patients with mast cell disease. GI involvement in systemic mastocytosis is heterogeneous and symptoms may be caused by infiltration of abnormal mast cells in the GI tract and/or by the downstream effect of mast cell mediators on GI tissues. GI symptoms described the monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome are best characterized in the context of acute anaphylaxis. The presence of GI symptoms and a subjective response of symptoms to anti-mast cell mediator therapy are considered qualifying criteria in the diagnosis of the idiopathic mast cell activation syndrome. Antimediator therapy may help alleviate GI symptoms in mast cell disease.

INTRODUCTION

Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) originated as a term to describe the phenotype of mast cell activation (MCA) in patients with features of systemic mastocytosis. Sonneck et al. used the term to unify patients with profound hypotension in response to hymenoptera envenomation who either fully or partially met systemic mastocytosis criteria. Akin et al. used mast cell activation to describe patients with recurrent idiopathic anaphylaxis with or without features of monoclonal mast cell disease. Throughout multiple iterations, MCAS consensus criteria have consistently required (i) the presence of severe, systemic, and recurrent symptoms associated with mast cell degranulation (e.g. anaphylaxis), in addition to (ii) evidence of acute mast cell mediator elevation above a patient-specific baseline and (iii) therapeutic response to mast cell-directed therapies –. The European Competence Network on Mastocytosis and the American Initiative in Mast Cell Diseases (ECNM-AIM) consortium criteria (hereafter designated "consortium MCAS criteria") reaffirm this definition and further expand on the relation of MCAS to the broader MCA disorders (MCADs), including monoclonal (e.g. clonal mast cell disease with activating mutations in c-KIT), secondary (e.g. severe IgE-mediated hypersensitivities), and idiopathic MCAS.

However, alternatives definitions for MCAS have been proposed outside of expert organizations like ECNM and AIM and utilized as unvalidated clinical criteria (hereafter designated "alternative MCAS criteria"). The symptoms accepted by these proposed alternative criteria are more numerous than those of the consortium MCAS criteria (153 vs. 18, respectively), invoke a broader range of clinical systems, appear less specific to the physiologic effects of mast cell mediators, and do not require the severity of consortium MCAS criteria. Laboratory criteria can be satisfied by isolated mast cell mediator elevation above a reference range, rather than acute elevation above a patient-specific baseline. However, baseline mast cell mediator levels exhibit significant inter- and intra-personal variation –, limiting laboratory specificity and increasing the relative influence of symptoms alone in satisfying alternative criteria compared to consortium criteria.

### Global classification of mast cell activation disorders: an ICD-10-CM-adjusted proposal of the ECNM-AIM consortium [^4eb4edcb]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Mast cell activation (MCA) is common and occurs in a number of pathologic conditions, including IgE-dependent and independent allergic reactions, atopic disorders, autoimmune processes, and mastocytosis. In a subset of patients, no underlying disease and no known trigger of MCA are found. When the symptoms are severe, systemic, and recurrent, and accompanied by a diagnostic increase in the serum tryptase level or other mast cell mediators, an MCA syndrome (MCAS) may be diagnosed. In these patients, the symptoms typically respond to drugs suppressing MCA, mediator production in mast cells, or mediator effects. In each case, diagnostic consensus criteria must be fulfilled to diagnose MCAS. In other patients, MCA may be local, less severe, or less acute, or may be suspected but not confirmed, so that the diagnostic criteria of MCAS are not fulfilled. In these patients, it may be difficult to prove MCA, for example, by measuring multiple mast cell mediators or basophil activation, the latter as a surrogate of IgE-dependent hypersensitivity. However, validated diagnostic criteria for implicating suspected MCA behind such conditions are lacking, even if some of these conditions have recently been assigned to an International Classification of Diseases-10-Clinical Modification code (ICD-10-CM). In this article, we discuss diagnostic features and criteria and propose a ICD-10-CM-adjusted classification for disorders associated with MCA, herein referred to as MCA disorders (MCADs), with special emphasis on the delineation between confirmed MCAS, MCAD not fulfilling MCAS criteria, and suspected MCAD that is not present. In addition, we discuss the discrimination between overt MCAD and predisposing conditions, such as atopic states, mastocytosis, and hereditary alpha tryptasemia.

### Mast cell activation syndrome: a newly recognized disorder with systemic clinical manifestations [^9bcd08ec]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnostic criteria for mast cell (MC) activation syndrome have been recently proposed, but clinical studies to validate these criteria are lacking.

Objective

We sought to determine the clinical manifestations of this newly recognized syndrome in a cohort of patients.

Methods

We prospectively evaluated 18 patients seen at our institution with MC activation syndrome from 2006 to 2009. Patients enrolled had at least 4 of the signs and symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, flushing, dermatographism, memory and concentration difficulties, or headache. Response to treatment with anti-MC mediator medications was assessed based on established criteria. Laboratory tests indicating MC mediator release and histopathology and immunohistochemical studies on gastrointestinal biopsy samples were performed.

Results

Ninety-four percent of the patients had abdominal pain, 89% had dermatographism, 89% had flushing, and 72% had the constellation of all 3 symptoms. Patients additionally had headache, diarrhea, and memory and concentration difficulties. All patients had at least 1 positive laboratory test result for an increased MC mediator level. On the basis of the response to treatment criteria, 67% of the patients in the cohort had either a complete or major regression in symptoms while taking medications targeting MC mediators. There was no significant difference in the numbers of intestinal mucosal MCs between our patients and healthy control subjects.

Conclusion

MC activation syndrome might be the underlying cause of unexplained symptoms when several organ systems are involved, such as the gastrointestinal tract and the skin. It is especially important to be able to recognize the constellation of clinical features because response to anti-MC mediator medications is often excellent.

### Low prevalence of idiopathic mast cell activation syndrome among 703 patients with suspected mast cell disorders [^290458ba]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic mast cell activation syndrome (iMCAS) is characterized by severe, episodic systemic mast cell (MC) activation and mediator-related symptoms, an event-related increase in serum tryptase levels, and response to MC-targeted therapies in the absence of underlying IgE-mediated allergy or clonal MC disorder. Studies indicating its prevalence using evidence-based diagnostic criteria are lacking.

Objective

To assess the prevalence and clinical and laboratory features of patients with iMCAS.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective evaluation of data from 703 consecutive patients (aged ≥ 18 years) referred to our center based on suspicion of having MC disorders. Patients underwent a thorough clinical workup including patient history, allergy tests, KIT D816V mutation analysis, and/or bone marrow investigation. Disease activity was prospectively assessed during follow-up visits.

Results

We identified 31 patients with confirmed iMCAS. Furthermore, hereditary α-tryptasemia was detected in three patients with baseline tryptase levels greater than 8 ng/mL. The most common clinical presentation during MCAS episodes was mucocutaneous symptoms in patients with iMCAS, especially urticaria or angioedema. However, these symptoms were less prevalent in patients with clonal MCAS (P = 0.015). The duration of diagnostic delay was significantly longer in patients with iMCAS compared to those with clonal MCAS (P = 0.02).

Conclusions

The overall prevalence of iMCAS was 4.4% in the entire cohort, which indicates that iMCAS is an uncommon condition. To accurately diagnose iMCAS, it is crucial to evaluate suspected patients using the three diagnostic MCAS criteria. This involves performing a comprehensive allergy work-up including laboratory tests and ultrasensitive mutation analysis of KIT D816V. Subsequently, recommended diagnostic algorithms should be applied.

### Mast cell activation syndrome [^68b3377b]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) involves the skin, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurologic systems, classified as primary, secondary, and idiopathic. Earlier criteria for MCAS diagnosis included episodic symptoms with mast cell mediators affecting two or more organ systems with urticaria, angioedema, flushing, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramping, hypotensive syncope, tachycardia, wheezing, conjunctival injection, pruritus, nasal stuffiness, decrease in frequency, severity, or resolution of symptoms with anti-mediator therapy including H 1 /H 2 receptor antagonists, anti-leukotrienes, or mast cell stabilizers. Laboratory data includes an increased validated urinary or serum markers of MCAS, documentation of an increase of the marker above the patient's baseline value during symptomatic periods on more than two occasions, or baseline serum tryptase levels that are persistently above 15 ng/mL. Laboratory data also includes an increase of the tryptase level above baseline value on one occasion. Other assays are 24-h urine histamine metabolites, PGD 2 or its metabolite, and 11-β-prostaglandin F 2 alpha. A recent global classification is a response of clinical symptoms, a substantial transient increase in serum total tryptase or increase in other mast cell-derived mediators, histamine or PGD2 or urinary metabolites, and agents that attenuate production or mast cell mediator activities. "Spectrum of MCAS disorders" has been proposed, highlighting symptoms' diagnostic tests and treatments.

### Doctor, I think I Am suffering from MCAS: differential diagnosis and separating facts from fiction [^31baa8e8]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) is a rare condition defined by a severe systemic reaction to mast cell (MC)-derived mediators. Most cases present with clinical signs of anaphylaxis, and some have an underlying IgE-dependent allergy. A primary MC disease (mastocytosis) may also be detected. Severe recurrent MCAS episodes requiring intensive care or even resuscitation are typically found in patients who suffer from both mastocytosis and allergy against certain triggers, such as hymenoptera venom components. A less severe form and a local form of MC activation (MCA) also exist. For these patients, diagnostic criteria are lacking. Moreover, a number of different, unrelated, conditions with overlapping symptoms may be confused with MCAS. As a result, many patients believe that they are suffering from MCAS but have in fact a less severe form of MCA or another underlying disease. In the current article, we review the potential differential diagnoses of MCA and MCAS and discuss available diagnostic criteria and diagnostic tools. These criteria and assays may be useful in daily practice and help avoid unnecessary referrals and unjustified fears in patients.

### Chronic spontaneous urticaria: a review… [^471e235e]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance Chronic spontaneous urticaria affects approximately 1% of the general population worldwide, including approximately 3 million people in the US, impairs patients' quality of life, and is associated with multiple comorbidities. Observations. Chronic spontaneous urticaria affects patients of any age but is most common in females aged 30 to 50 years. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, ie, spontaneously recurring wheals, angioedema, or both. Chronic spontaneous urticaria persists for more than 1 year in most patients and may present with comorbidities including chronic inducible urticaria, autoimmune thyroiditis, metabolic syndrome, and anxiety and depression. Known autoimmune endotypes of chronic spontaneous urticaria are mediated by mast cell–activating IgE and/or IgG autoantibodies.

Approximately 40% of patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria have a Dermatology Life Quality Index of more than 10, corresponding to a very large or extremely large negative effect on quality of life. Second-generation H1 antihistamines are first-line treatment; partial or complete response, defined as a reduction in urticaria symptoms of greater than 50%, is observed in approximately 40% of patients. The 2022 international urticaria guideline recommends the monoclonal anti-IgE antibody omalizumab as second-line treatment for antihistamine-refractory chronic spontaneous urticaria. However, at least 30% of patients have an insufficient response to omalizumab, especially those with IgG-mediated autoimmune urticaria. Cyclosporine, used off-label, can improve symptoms in approximately 54% to 73% of patients, especially those with autoimmune chronic spontaneous urticaria and nonresponse to omalizumab, but has adverse effects such as kidney dysfunction and hypertension.

Conclusions and Relevance Chronic spontaneous urticaria is an inflammatory skin disease associated with medical and psychiatric comorbidities and impaired quality of life. Second-generation H1 antihistamines are first-line treatment, omalizumab is second-line treatment, and cyclosporine is third-line treatment for chronic spontaneous urticaria.

### Clustering of clinical symptoms using large language models reveals low diagnostic specificity of proposed alternatives to consensus mast cell activation syndrome criteria [^4a6e84e6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

An additional ECNM-AIM designation, "MCAD unspecified", represents a distinct clinical entity, marked by less severe presentations and less certainty about the relationship between symptoms and MCA. Importantly, the ECNM-AIM recommendations emphasize that "unspecified MCAD" should not be considered a final diagnosis and should motivate further investigation for an underlying etiology. The alternative MCAS definition resembles the ECNM-AIM designation of "MCAD unspecified", but utilizes the label of "MCAS" as a definitive diagnosis. Our analysis supports the ECNM-AIM recommendations that patients whose presentation matches "MCAD unspecified" or the alternative MCAS definition should be evaluated further to determine a more appropriate definitive diagnosis.

Arguably, a limitation of LLMs is that their training data represents a wide range of public text sources and is not restricted to medical literature. However, studies have confirmed that LLMs are capable of approximating high-level, open-ended, clinical reasoning. Moreover, as most MCAS referrals are based on patient self-evaluation and internet research, the broad training data underlying LLMs likely captures the symptom-diagnosis associations that lead patients to suspect MCAS. Additionally, the identification of expected diagnoses from the control criteria in our study supports the validity of using LLMs to simulate symptom-diagnosis associations.

In summary, we utilized multiple LLMs to bootstrap probability distributions for possible diagnoses resulting from different sets of MCAS criteria. We demonstrated that the broad range of symptoms included in the alternative MCAS criteria overlap with significantly more variable and less consistent diagnoses compared to consortium MCAS and control criteria. These results suggest that the proposed alternative MCAS criteria are an outlier in their relative lack of diagnostic specificity and their increased use risks overdiagnosis of MCAS to the exclusion of more appropriate diagnoses.

### Expanding spectrum of mast cell activation disorders: monoclonal and idiopathic mast cell activation syndromes [^0173ec33]. Clinical Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

In recent years, 2 new syndromes of mast cell activation have been described in patients with episodes of mast cell mediator release that range from flushing and abdominal cramping to anaphylaxis: monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome (MMAS) and idiopathic mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS).

Objective

This review will discuss these 2 new syndromes in the larger context of mast cell activation disorders as well as the diagnostic and treatment approaches for these conditions.

Methods

PubMed was searched using the following terms: mast cell activation disorder, mast cell activation syndrome, and clonal mast cell. Only English-language articles published up until February 27, 2013, were considered.

Results

MMAS has been diagnosed in patients with systemic reactions to hymenoptera stings and elevated baseline serum tryptase as well as in patients with unexplained episodes of anaphylaxis. A bone marrow biopsy establishes the diagnosis by revealing the presence of monoclonal mast cells that carry the D816V KIT mutation and/or express CD25 while the diagnostic requirements for systemic mastocytosis are not met. MCAS affects predominantly women in whom no mast cell abnormality or external triggers account for their episodes of mast cell activation. MCAS is a diagnosis of exclusion, and primary and secondary mast cell activation disorders as well as idiopathic anaphylaxis have to be ruled out before making the diagnosis. Patients with MCAS and MMAS are treated in a stepwise fashion with drugs that block the effects of mediators released by mast cells on activation. One third of MCAS patients experience complete resolution of symptoms with treatment, while one third have a major response and one third a minor response to treatment. A combination of drugs is usually necessary to achieve symptom control. No drug trial has been performed in patients with MMAS and MCAS.

Conclusions

MMAS and MCAS are 2 newly described, rare syndromes of mast cell activation. Further studies will be necessary to better understand the cause of these conditions and their natural evolution and to validate and improve the treatment approach. Research should also focus on developing drugs with the potential to cure these debilitating disorders. To achieve these goals, centers with expertise in mast cell activation disorders are essential as they allow for a critical mass of these patients to be enrolled in studies while providing those patients with the most up-to-date diagnostic procedures and treatment strategies.

### H1-antihistamines for primary mast cell activation syndromes: a systematic review [^260194a5]. Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Primary mast cell activation syndromes (MCAS) are a group of disorders presenting with symptoms of mast cell mediator release.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of orally administered H1 -antihistamines in the treatment of primary MCAS compared with placebo and other pharmacologic treatments.

Methods

We systematically searched five databases and three trial repositories and contacted an international panel of experts to identify published and unpublished trials.

Results

A total of 36 potentially relevant studies were identified. Of these, five crossover trials, enrolling a total of 71 patients (63 adults), met the eligibility criteria. All five of these studies were judged to be at moderate or high risk of bias. Two studies compared an H1 -antihistamine with placebo, two compared two different H1 -antihistamines, and one study compared H1 - and H2 -antihistamines with oral cromolyn sodium. Four of the five randomized controlled trials were historic (reported from 1983–1993), small (enrolling 8–15 patients), and used agents and/or dosing regimens that are now less commonly used in clinical practice (i.e. azelastine, chlorpheniramine, hydroxyzine, and ketotifen). The fifth trial, which enrolled 33 adults with cutaneous and systemic mastocytosis found 4 weeks of treatment with the second-generation H1 -antihistamine rupatadine, compared with placebo, resulted in significant improvements in quality of life, symptom control (itching, wheals and flares, flushing, tachycardia, and headache, but not gastrointestinal symptoms), and reduction in itching and whealing after standardized skin provocation to elicit Darier's sign.

Conclusions

There is an urgent need for large, well-designed, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trials investigating the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and safety of second-generation H1 -antihistamines in treatment of primary MCAS.

### Idiopathic mast cell activation syndrome is more often suspected than diagnosed – A prospective real-life study [^987925fe]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) is characterized by three diagnostic criteria: (1) episodic mast cell (MC)-driven signs/symptoms of at least two organ systems in the absence of clonal MC expansion and definite triggers, (2) episodic increase in tryptase, and (3) response to MC-targeted treatment. Many patients believe they have MCAS, but how often this is the case remains unknown.

Methods

We prospectively investigated patients with suspected MCAS (n = 100) for the diagnostic criteria including baseline tryptase, KIT D816V mutation, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) over the course of 12 weeks. Comorbid depression and anxiety were explored with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).

Results

In 53% of our patients (80% females), suspicion of MCAS was based on self-evaluation. In total, patients reported 87 different symptoms, mostly fatigue (n = 57), musculoskeletal pain/weakness (n = 49), and abdominal pain (n = 43), with overall high disease activity and impact. Two of 79 patients had increased tryptase (by > 20% +2 ng/ml) following an episode. Only 5%, with any of the PROMs used, showed complete response to MC-targeted treatment. Depression and anxiety disorders were frequent comorbidities (n = 23 each), and 65 patients had pathological HADS values, which were linked to high disease impact and poor symptom control.

Conclusion

Mast cell activation syndrome was confirmed in only 2% of patients, which implies that it is not MC activation that drives signs and symptoms in most patients with suspected MCAS. There is a high need for comprehensive research efforts aimed at the identification of the true underlying pathomechanism(s) in patients with suspected MCAS.

### AAAAI mast cell disorders committee work group report: mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) diagnosis and management [^be3638b0]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2019). High credibility.

Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) definition and mediator-directed therapy — MCAS is defined as a primary clinical condition with spontaneous episodic systemic anaphylaxis affecting at least 2 organ systems and resulting from secreted mast cell mediators; symptoms occur with secretion of mast cell products (tryptase, histamine, prostaglandin D2, leukotriene C4) leading to increased blood or urine levels of these mediators or metabolites (N-methylhistamine, 11β-PGF2α, LTE4/LTD4), and symptoms should improve with medications that block receptor binding or reduce production, including H1 histamine receptor and H2 histamine receptor antihistamines and type 1 cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonists, inhibitors of COX for PGD2 or 5-lipoxygenase for LTC4, and mast cell stabilizers such as omalizumab.

Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) — antihistamines for prevention and symptom control: Nonsedating H1 antihistamines are generally preferred and can be increased to 2 to 4 times the standard dose; sedating H1 antihistamines might acutely cause drowsiness and chronically lead to cognitive decline, particularly in the elderly. H2R antihistamines can be used as first-line therapy for gastrointestinal symptoms and might help H1R antihistamines attenuate cardiovascular symptoms. Recommendations for antihistamine therapy for MC activation disorders are based on expert opinion, and H1R and H2R antihistamine receptors work better as prophylactic than acute treatment. In patients with MCAS, H1R blockers reduce dermatologic manifestations, such as flushing and pruritus, along with tachycardia and abdominal discomfort, and later-generation nonsedating H1R antihistamines, such as fexofenadine and cetirizine, are often used at 2 to 4 times US Food and Drug Administration–approved doses.

### AAAAI mast cell disorders committee work group report: mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) diagnosis and management [^f9f7d992]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2019). High credibility.

Current classification and unmet needs explain that the recommendations make use of the latest studies and consensus guidelines for clinically diagnosing systemic anaphylaxis in real time, regardless of whether allergens were triggered through the IgE pathway or through other pathways, and also do not address the occurrence of local MC activation. An increase in MC numbers in the gastrointestinal tract or elsewhere by itself does not provide a diagnosis of MC activation or indicate that MC activity is affected. Detection of an activating KIT mutation, such as one causing D816V, in peripheral blood or tissue demonstrates clonality; surface expression of CD25 on MCs is a surrogate marker for clonality; and the presence of dense aggregates of spindle-shaped MCs suggests underlying mastocytosis. Whether the plasticity of human MCs, governed largely by their local tissue or inflammatory environment, might affect their activation into a clinically significant manner needs to be better understood.

Tryptase algorithm for diagnosing systemic anaphylaxis — serum acute tryptase (SAT) relative to baseline tryptase (BT) uses the threshold "SAT > (1.2*BT) + 2"; neither an sBT nor an sAT alone has sufficient sensitivity, and sensitivity increases with clinical severity, primarily correlating with hypotension. For sampling, the optimal acute blood collection is 30 to 120 minutes after symptom onset, and the optimal baseline sample is either before the event or at least 24 hours after all signs and symptoms have resolved. The test has high specificity (> 90%), while sensitivity varies with time of collection, clinical severity, and trigger.

### Association of postural tachycardia syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with mast cell activation disorders [^633ed86b]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Mast cell activation disorders (MCADs) consist of episodic systemic symptoms due to mast cell mediator release. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation and determination of high levels of tryptase or histamine. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) and postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) frequently coexist. It has been described that individuals with these syndromes can even present symptoms compatible to MCADs, which could represent a new specific phenotype. Preliminary genetic data suggest a role for tryptase in the pathogenesis of MCADs, EDS, and POTS association. Studies with larger samples evaluating clinics, genetics, and histopathology are required to define the real correlation between these 3 clinical entities.

Tryptase testing for suspected systemic mast cell (MC) activation — mature tryptase peaks 30 to 90 minutes after onset and declines with a half-life of about 2 hours. Optimal use of total tryptase requires an acute sample collected between 30 minutes and 2 hours after onset, with increases up to 4 to 6 hours still informative, and a baseline sample obtained before the event or at least 24 hours after all signs and symptoms have abated. For an increase in the acute total tryptase (sAT) to be considered clinically significant relative to the baseline tryptase (sBT), the formula sAT > (1.2* bST) + 2 is recommended, and physicians should consider using this assay and an algorithm for any clinical event thought to be due to systemic activation of MCs, particularly if hypotension is present or in patients with hereditary α-tryptasemia or a somatic KIT mutation.

### Management of mediator symptoms, allergy, and anaphylaxis in mastocytosis [^a61f9650]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Mastocytosis is characterized by expansion and activation of clonally aberrant mast cells (MCs) in one or more organ systems. Inappropriate MC activation is a key finding in both allergy and mastocytosis; therefore, symptoms in both conditions show some degree of overlap. When mediator release is excessive and involves multiple systems, anaphylaxis may occur. In mastocytosis, the prevalence of atopy is similar to those of the general population, whereas the incidence of anaphylaxis is significantly higher. The purpose of this review is to discuss features of allergy and anaphylaxis as well as the principles of managing MC mediator release symptoms in mastocytosis.

### Clinical, biological, and molecular characteristics of clonal mast cell disorders presenting with systemic mast cell activation symptoms [^19af311d]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Spanish Network on Mastocytosis score for systemic mastocytosis (REMA score)" for systemic mastocytosis and anaphylaxis.

The REMA score, or the Spanish Network on Mastocytosis score, is a clinical calculator used specifically for patients with suspected systemic mastocytosis. Systemic mastocytosis is a rare disorder characterized by an excessive accumulation of mast cells in various organs. The REMA score helps in the diagnosis of this condition by evaluating various clinical and laboratory parameters such as skin lesions, serum tryptase levels, and bone marrow biopsy results.

The clinical utility of the REMA score lies in its ability to differentiate systemic mastocytosis from other conditions with similar symptoms, thus guiding appropriate treatment strategies. It is particularly useful in cases where the diagnosis is uncertain or when the patient presents with atypical symptoms.

The REMA score may not be applicable or reliable in patients with other concurrent hematological disorders, as these may influence the parameters used in the score calculation. Additionally, it may not be suitable for use in pediatric patients as the score was developed and validated in adult populations.

The Spanish Network on Mastocytosis (REMA) score calculator evaluates the likelihood of a clonal mast cell activation disorder based on user inputs across four parameters. Each input is assigned a numerical score, and the total score is used to assess the probability of the disorder.

Inputs and their respective scoring system:

| **Parameter** | **Options** | **Score assignment** |
|-|-|-|
| Gender | Male, Female | 1 |
| Urticaria and/or angioedema | None, Yes | None = 1, Yes = 2|
| Presyncope and/or syncope | None, Yes | None = 0, Yes = 3|
| Baseline serum tryptase | < 15 ng/mL, > 15 ng/mL | < 15 ng/mL = 1, > 15 ng/mL = 2|

The score is calculated by adding up the numeric values associated with each selected option. The total score determines if the individual is at low or high risk for a clonal mast cell activation disorder.

Interpretation of scores:

- **Score 3 or less**: Low probability of clonal mast cell activation disorder.
- **Score 4 to 8**: High probability of clonal mast cell activation disorder.

Collect the user's responses for each parameter and convert these responses into numerical values according to the predefined scoring system. Sum these values to get the total score. Finally, interpret the score to determine the probability of clonal mast cell activation disorder.

### Acute / baseline ratios of all 3 MC mediator metabolites can enhance diagnosis and management of mast cell activation syndrome [^28bb6938]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

It is recognized that the criterion standard for diagnosing mast cell (MC) activation syndrome (MCAS) in patients presenting with symptoms of MC degranulation in 2 or more organ systems is the finding of an acute elevation of serum tryptase level above baseline by 20% plus an additional 2 ng/mL. Additionally, patients with MCAS must satisfy a third criterion, namely, improvement with MC-directed treatment. Patients presenting with stage 1 (mild) idiopathic anaphylaxis (ie, having skin rash, itching, redness, or hives) or stage 2 (moderate) idiopathic anaphylaxis (ie, having more widespread skin rash and hives or mild angioedema of the lips or tongue) would not qualify as having idiopathic MCAS because of only single-organ involvement. Patients having the more severe idiopathic anaphylaxis, stage 3 or 4 with multiorgan involvement, must still meet the criteria of tryptase level elevation and clinical response to be diagnosed as having MCAS. Although these clinical and laboratory criteria are commonly reported, it is difficult to find reports that the third criterion for defining MCAS, namely, clinical improvement or prevention of attacks, has been satisfied following institution of treatment. This, in part, could be ascribed to the difficulty of prescribing appropriate therapy without knowledge that levels of MC mediator(s) are elevated during attacks. Urinary samples obtained contemporaneously with attacks can be used to measure levels of the MC mediator metabolites N-methyl histamine (N-MH), (2,3-dinor)-11β–prostaglandin F 2α (PGF 2α), and leukotriene E 4 (LTE 4). Currently, however, despite their utility, these mediators are not currently included in the definition of MCAS. Several other mediators are synthesized and secreted by MCs; however, these are not commonly measured in clinical laboratories and are not as yet included in defining systemic mastocytosis or MCAS. Of the 3 urinary MC mediator measurements, those of LTE 4 have received the least attention. Here we present the cases of 3 patients with MCAS, confirming the marked increases in LTE 4 excretion and providing evidence that blockade of this product can contribute to beneficial clinical effects.

### The mastocytosis society survey on mast cell disorders: patient experiences and perceptions [^6fd5296d]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Mast cell diseases include mastocytosis and mast cell activation syndromes, some of which have been shown to involve clonal defects in mast cells that result in abnormal cellular proliferation or activation. Numerous clinical studies of mastocytosis have been published, but no population-based comprehensive surveys of patients in the United States have been identified. Few mast cell disease specialty centers exist in the United States, and awareness of these mast cell disorders is limited among nonspecialists. Accordingly, information concerning the experiences of the overall estimated population of these patients has been lacking.

Objective

To identify the experiences and perceptions of patients with mastocytosis, mast cell activation syndromes, and related disorders, The Mastocytosis Society (TMS), a US based patient advocacy, research, and education organization, conducted a survey of its members and other people known or suspected to be part of this patient population.

Methods

A Web-based survey was publicized through clinics that treat these patients and through TMS's newsletter, Web site, and online blogs. Both online and paper copies of the questionnaire were provided, together with required statements of consent.

Results

The first results are presented for 420 patients. These results include demographics, diagnoses, symptoms, allergies, provoking factors of mast cell symptoms, and disease impact.

Conclusion

Patients with mastocytosis and mast cell activation syndromes have provided clinical specialists, collaborators, and other patients with information to enable them to explore and deepen their understanding of the experiences and perceptions of people coping with these disorders.

### Mast cell activation and nutritional disorders in patients with hypermobility [^54064c05]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Individuals with joint hypermobility disorders are increasingly referred to gastroenterology services for support with the investigation and management of gastrointestinal complaints. Individuals can present with a myriad of complex coexisting diagnoses, the inter-relationship of which is unclear. This review discusses the proposed association between hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) and hypermobility spectrum disorder (HSD) with disorders of mast cell activation and provides an overview of gastrointestinal symptoms and nutritional outcomes in this patient cohort.

Recent Findings

It is unclear whether a true association between hEDS/HSD and mast cell activation disorders exists. There is a high prevalence of nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms in individuals with hEDS/HSD and patients may be at risk of macro-nutrient and micro-nutrient deficiencies, although the current evidence base is limited.

Summary

We advocate a pragmatic approach to the investigation and management of gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with hEDS/HSD. This centres on excluding organic pathology, discussing the overlap with disorders of gut-brain interactions, trialling evidence-based therapies targeting individual symptoms, and supporting nutritional deficiencies where present via the least invasive approach. Engagement with a broad multidisciplinary team is also important to support the holistic needs of this patient cohort.

### Mastocytosis… [^1bb4afec]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Mastocytosis is characterized by large amounts of mast cells accumulating in the body. Abnormal activation of MCs leads to accelerated growth and accumulation in the skin, bone marrow, and internal organs. Mastocytosis is divided into 7 categories based on World Health Organization classification. Two major types are cutaneous and systemic mastocytosis. There are several types of CM, including maculopapular and diffuse. SM also has several subtypes, including indolent and aggressive. These classifications are defined by the age of the patient at disease onset and histopathologic criteria. There are a variety of symptoms due to histamine, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, chemokines, and tryptase, which are released during MC activation. Skin manifestations range from mild pruritus to anaphylaxis, with 10% of pediatric patients developing anaphylaxis.

However, in SM, symptoms may include flushing and pruritus, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and hypotension. Comments.

Mast cells produce symptoms by local and remote effects of mediator release and by their presence in increased numbers in normal tissue and bone marrow, where they damage and impair normal organ function. Moreover, mast cells are long-lived and heterogeneous in their response to secretagogues and to inhibitors of mediator release. Clinicians sorting out the diagnosis of SM on the basis of presenting signs and symptoms continue to have their diagnostic skills challenged because of the rarity of this disorder, the fact that many symptoms of SM are present in more common disorders, and the multiple guises that SM may assume at the time of presentation.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, more specifically with respect to evaluation for gastrointestinal symptoms, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider testing for mast cell disorders, including mast cell activation syndrome, in patients with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders and disorders of gut-brain interaction who present with episodic symptoms suggesting a generalized mast cell disorder involving ≥ 2 physiological systems. Do not use these tests for routine evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms in all patients with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders without clinical or laboratory evidence of a primary or secondary mast cell disorder.

### Irritable bowel syndrome and the elusive mast cells [^68b29b58]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common condition seen by gastroenterologists. It presents with alternating symptoms of bowel dysfunction that often worsens with stress. The cause of these symptoms eludes investigators and many attempts have been made to discover an underlying pathology. This is a daunting task since symptoms come and go, and change characteristics. Furthermore, the pathology of IBS is unlikely to be identical in all patients. In addition, all symptoms and all features studied thus far have a strong overlap with healthy volunteers. Elsewhere in this issue, Braak et al. report a well-designed clinical investigation in patients with IBS and come to the conclusion that IBS is not characterized by mast cell or other immune cell proliferation, but by immune dysregulation in the colon. Is this the final answer?

Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) — additional preventive pharmacologic agents: Cromolyn sodium can reduce abdominal bloating, diarrhea, and cramps; benefit might extend to neuropsychiatric manifestations, and divided dosing with weekly upward titration might improve tolerance and adherence. Doxepin, a potent H1 + H2 antihistamine with tricyclic antidepressant activity, might reduce central nervous system manifestations in patients with MCAS or SM but might cause drowsiness and cognitive decline and might increase suicidal tendencies in children and young adults with depression. Aspirin might reduce flushing and hypotension in some patients but is contraindicated in those with allergic or adverse reactions to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and clinical improvement might require a dosing increase up to 650 mg twice daily. For refractory signs or symptoms, a steroid taper/steroid burst might be useful at an initial oral dosage of 0.5 mg/kg/day, followed by a slow taper over 1 to 3 months, and it might be helpful to give 50 mg of prednisone 13 hours, 7 hours, and 1 hour before radiologic or invasive procedures when MC activation has been problematic.

### Pathogenic and diagnostic relevance of KIT in primary mast cell activation disorders [^a2001fd7]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Mast cell (MC) activation (MCA) defines the mechanism by which certain patients have symptoms owing to the effect of a wide range of mediators released from MCs upon their activation, when triggered by different stimuli. When these symptoms are severe and recurrent, the diagnosis of MCA syndrome (MCAS) might be considered. Here, we review the relevant aspects related to the pathogenesis of MCAS, with special emphasis on the prevalence and diagnostic relevance of KIT mutations.

Data Sources

PubMed was searched between 1980 and 2021 using the following terms: mast cell activation syndromes, mast cell activation, anaphylaxis, KIT mutations, KIT D816V, indolent systemic mastocytosis, bone marrow mastocytosis, cutaneous mastocytosis, IgE anaphylaxis, and idiopathic anaphylaxis.

Study Selections

Only articles published in English were selected based on their relevance to MCAS or severe and recurrent anaphylaxis.

Results

MCAS can be classified as clonal MCAS and nonclonal MCAS depending on the presence vs absence of an underlying KIT mutation (mostly KIT D816V), respectively. In contrast to clonal MCAS in which MCA is associated with a primary MC disorder (ie, primary MCAS) such as mastocytosis or monoclonal MCAS, nonclonal MCAS can be secondary to known or unidentified triggers (ie, secondary and idiopathic MCAS, respectively).

Conclusion

The clinical heterogeneity and complexity of the molecular assays needed for the study of patients with MCAS might lead to misdiagnosis, particularly when patients are evaluated at nonspecialized centers. Thus, referral of patients having clinical manifestations suggestive of MCAS to reference centers on mastocytosis and MC diseases is strongly recommended.

Prognosis and length of therapy in MCAS state that there are no specific studies evaluating the prognosis of patients with MCAS. Some patients with clonal MCAS can progress to SM, most likely indolent SM, but none of the patients in the Mayo Clinic cohort followed for more than 15 years had mastocytosis, and data regarding patients with indolent SM demonstrate a normal life expectancy. We propose treatment based on symptoms and increased levels of MC mediators; for example, if a patient with MCAS has increased urinary LTE4 levels, then LT antagonists are recommended, and if urinary PG metabolite levels were increased, then treatment with aspirin might help; therefore the therapeutic intervention should be adjusted to fit each patient.

### Mast cell mediation of visceral sensation and permeability in irritable bowel syndrome [^014f41fd]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most prevalent gastrointestinal disorder and presents with abdominal pain and altered bowel habits. IBS pathophysiology is heterogeneous and variable from patient to patient. Visceral hypersensitivity may underlie symptoms in large IBS subsets, Dysfunction of epithelial barrier function with increases in permeability may contribute to altered defecation and pain in IBS. Alterations in gut bacterial populations are common and may participate in IBS pathophysiology. Each of these factors interact with each other and other factors including bile acids, enteric and central nervous activity, and the immune system to produce IBS symptoms. Better understanding of mechanisms underlying development of hypersensitivity, epithelial dysfunction, and gut dysbiosis in IBS will provide insight into symptom pathogenesis and facilitate drug discovery for improved treatment of this condition.

Mucosal mast cells are increased and show heightened activation in some IBS subsets. Mast cells can elicit visceral hypersensitivity, influence epithelial function, and interact with gut microbes providing a possible link between the neuroimmune system and other contributors to IBS pathogenesis. The aims of this review are to describe gut mast cell biology, characterize mast cell abnormalities in IBS, detail roles of mast cell activity in visceral hypersensitivity, epithelial barrier function, and enteric microbial activity, and to speculate on the potential for future therapies targeting mast cell functions in IBS.

Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) — leukotriene pathway modulation, prostaglandin D2 (PGD2)–targeting with aspirin, cromolyn, and glucocorticosteroids are described: Other therapies include cysteinyl leukotriene receptor blocking agents, such as montelukast and zafirlukast, or the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor zileuton, and these medications might work best in conjunction with H1R antihistamines, being most efficacious for dermatologic symptoms. Aspirin has been used to attenuate refractory flushing and hypotensive spells associated with PGD2 secretion by inhibiting its synthesis and should be introduced in a controlled clinical setting because of the risk of triggering MC degranulation. Oral cromolyn is used predominantly for gastrointestinal symptoms, and cromolyn taken orally or applied topically also might reduce pruritus; patients should be counseled that the onset of action can be delayed and should be taken for at least 1 month before deciding whether it is helping, and dosing can be gradually increased to 200 mg 4 times a day, given before each meal and at bedtime. Systemic steroids might help some patients, as indicated in case reports, but should be tapered as quickly as possible to limit their numerous adverse effects.

### Clustering of clinical symptoms using large language models reveals low diagnostic specificity of proposed alternatives to consensus mast cell activation syndrome criteria [^2ff9e79c]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Validating this approach, for each set of control criteria, the expected diagnosis was found within the top 10 observed diagnoses and most of the top 10 conditions represented the same class of disorder as the expected diagnosis (e.g. rheumatologic for SLE criteria) (Figure 3A - D). The top diagnosis associated with consortium MCAS criteria represents the most severe acute manifestation of mast cell activation, anaphylaxis (Figure 3E). The top 10 diagnoses also included systemic mastocytosis and IgE mediated food allergy. In contrast, the top 10 diagnoses associated with alternative MCAS criteria did not include any allergic or primarily histamine-mediated conditions, instead spanning several distinct disease categories including rheumatologic, endocrine, hematologic, and infectious (Figure 3F). The similarity of all diagnoses generated by the two MCAS criteria was low, particularly compared to the similarity between SLE criteria (Figure 3G). Mast cell related conditions were ranked notably lower in the alternative MCAS criteria compared to the consortium MCAS criteria (Table 1). Together, this indicates significant dissimilarity in the types of conditions recognized by the two MCAS criteria, with alternative MCAS criteria more likely to overlap with conditions that are not primarily mast-cell mediated.

The top 50 diagnoses of the control conditions and consortium MCAS criteria accounted for the majority of each criteria's total diagnoses (range 75.6–89.4%; Figure 3H). By comparison, only 48.4% of all alternative MCAS-associated diagnoses were found in the top 50. Correspondingly, the Shannon diversity of alternative MCAS criteria diagnoses was significantly higher than consortium MCAS criteria diagnoses (5.8 vs. 4.6, respectively; p-value = 0.004), as well as all control criteria (p-value < 0.05 for all; Figure 3I). The consistency of each of the 10,000 differential diagnosis iterations within each set of criteria was significantly lower for alternative MCAS criteria compared to consortium MCAS criteria (Bray-Curtis similarity 0.07 vs 0.19, respectively; p-value = 0.004) and control criteria for other diseases (all p-values < 0.01; Figure 3J). Collectively, these results show that alternative MCAS criteria overlap with a highly variable range of possible diagnoses and, compared to control and consortium MCAS criteria, are less able to reduce the range of diagnostic possibilities down to a narrow and consistent set of likely conditions.

### Mast cell activation disorder and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: a clinical association [^39f9c8cc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Main Findings

This study provides 4 main findings regarding differences between patients in whom the clinical presentation included symptoms that are not typically considered to be caused by POTS compared with patients with a typical POTS presentation. First, the frequency with which MCA laboratory abnormalities were detected in the former population was relatively high. While solitary laboratory abnormalities cannot provide a definitive MCA diagnosis, the possibility of a coexisting MCA disorder merits consideration given its potential impact on treatment strategy. Second, patients with abnormal laboratory findings manifested a more diverse symptom landscape, particularly including allergy complaints and gastrointestinal issues (most often gastroparesis), and to a lesser extent skin rash/flushing, than did those individuals who had normal laboratory findings (Table 3). Third, while elevated plasma tryptase level is a valuable biochemical marker for mastocytosis or mast cell leukemia, and may be useful in confirming MCA as suggested in Consensus‐1, abnormal tryptase levels were uncommon (9%) among the laboratory findings in our study. Finally, elevated prostaglandins in conjunction with an abnormally elevated histamine marker (ie, plasma histamine or urine methyl‐histamine) was the most frequent diagnostic combination supporting a possible MCA diagnosis in our patients.

Laboratory Recognition of MCA and Its Limitations

Many conditions, including MCA, have been implicated in producing symptoms suggestive of POTS. MCA is particularly important in this regard because its presence markedly alters therapeutic strategy. Specifically, patients with MCA may benefit from histamine receptor (H1 and H2) blockers used in conjunction with mast cell stabilizer agents and possibly vitamin D. These agents are not usually part of a typical POTS treatment regimen.

Mast cells are estimated to contain several hundred chemical mediators that are either stored in situ or manufactured de novo as requirement demands. While many such chemicals may be released by other cells, particularly basophils, the mast cell appears to be the most important.

Chemical mediators released from mast cells may affect multiple systems resulting in diverse symptoms (eg, allergic reactions, cutaneous disturbances, and gastrointestinal complaints) that may wax and wane in severity over time. The result is a potentially very heterogeneous clinical picture, with only some affected individuals having symptoms suggesting POTS. It is in the latter cases that the presence of complaints beyond the typical expected with POTS (ie, palpitations, "lightheadedness", and "brain fog") should raise the possibility of an underlying or coexisting MCA disorder.

Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) — histamine receptor–targeted therapies are outlined: First-generation H1R antihistamines include diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, and chlorpheniramine, but a limitation is their sedative action, impairing driving ability and leading to cognitive decline, particularly in elderly patients, with concern about use in patients with MCAS who are prone to cardiovascular events. Cyproheptadine would function as a sedating H1R blocker and a serotonin receptor antagonist and has been used to treat diarrhea and nausea in MCAS, and ketotifen is available as a compounded medication in the United States and is used to treat dermatologic, gastrointestinal, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Rupatadine, an H1R blocker that also blocks platelet-activating factor binding to its receptor, is approved for use in many countries but not in the United States, and in patients with mastocytosis improved control of pruritus, flushing, tachycardia, and headache but not gastrointestinal symptoms; studies for treating MCAS were promising, but not conclusive. H2R blocking agents are commonly used to treat abdominal and/or vascular signs or symptoms of MCAS, with options including nizatidine, famotidine, and cimetidine; H2R antihistamines prevent histamine-mediated acid secretion from parietal cells and blunt vasoactive effects of intravenously infused histamine if combined with an H1R antagonist. Importantly, H1R and H2R blocking agents, especially those with anticholinergic effects, can be associated with cognitive decline that is worse in elderly populations, and therapeutic antagonists for H3 and H4 receptors are in development and might have novel clinical value, particularly H4 receptor antagonists, which reduce pruritus and inflammation in atopic dermatitis.

### Clustering of clinical symptoms using large language models reveals low diagnostic specificity of proposed alternatives to consensus mast cell activation syndrome criteria [^5872113d]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients referred to allergists for idiopathic MCAS often do not demonstrate abnormal mast cell activation. In a study of MCAS referrals, only 3% of patients demonstrated elevated tryptase levels during acute episodes and only 21% achieved symptom control with mast cell-directed therapies, suggesting an alternative pathophysiology. Importantly, 56% of referrals were based on patient self-evaluation and internet research, which are unlikely to be accompanied by supportive laboratory data due to the specialized nature of mast cell mediator testing and interpretation.

Due to the disproportionate weight of symptomatology in alternative MCAS criteria and the factors that motivate referrals for evaluation of MCAS, we sought to address whether differences in symptom-based criteria between consortium and alternative MCAS criteria could contribute to overdiagnosis. We utilized multiple transformer-based large language models (LLMs), including ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, to evaluate criteria specificity based on symptom-diagnosis associations. These LLMs model complex semantic relationships to derive computational understanding of natural language, are capable of numerous natural language tasks within medicine, and have been shown to encode clinical knowledge within their internalized embeddings. Here, we utilized these LLMs to generate diagnosis probability distributions to evaluate MCAS criteria specificity.

Algorithm for diagnosing mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) is depicted as: recurrent symptoms consistent with mast cell activation with involvement of two organs; elevation of one or more validated mast cell mediators in association with the symptoms; and response to targeted therapeutic interventions, followed by TEST of peripheral blood or bone marrow GOF KIT mutation or buccal swab increased TPSAB1 α-tryptase CNV. IF Positive THEN Primary MCAS with somatic or germ line mutation; IF Negative THEN MCAS without known mutation. The figure notes that somatic KIT mutation assays have limited sensitivity, that the germline TPSAB1 α-tryptase CNV test is available from Gene by Gene (Houston, Tex.), and that if the peripheral blood allele-specific D816V KIT mutation is negative but REMA or NIH scores are positive, then a bone marrow study for a GOF KIT mutation should be considered.

Alpha-tryptasemia, hypotension, and tryptase changes — spontaneous bouts of hypotension caused by POTS are not typically associated with a clinically significant sAT increase and in such cases do not reflect mast cell activation, whereas systemic anaphylaxis with increased sAT over sBT occurs in some patients with α-tryptasemia, including spontaneous and insect venom–triggered episodes, making this condition an inherited risk factor for MCAS. Sensitivity also increases with clinical severity, primarily correlating with hypotension.

### Mast cell activation disorder and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: a clinical association [^86b1af3b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) was initially characterized in a small group of highly selected individuals in whom palpitations and lightheadedness, triggered by upright posture, were deemed to be caused by a limited form of autonomic dysfunction. Subsequently, however, the POTS diagnosis has increasingly been suspected and/or applied much more broadly, encompassing patients with often poorly understood symptoms involving multiple organ systems and that are not typically considered to be caused by POTS.

The cause of POTS in individual patients is usually unknown, despite a number of conditions having been implicated; these include viral illnesses, trauma, and various inflammatory diseases. Mast cell activation (MCA) disorder has also been implicated since chemical mediators released from mast cells may cause symptoms suggestive of POTS (eg, postural tachycardia, lightheadedness). On the other hand, MCA mediators may also result in systemic nonorthostatic symptoms that are not typical of POTS such as flushing, urticaria, angioedema, nasal congestion, airway reactivity, vomiting, headache, and diarrhea.

Recently, 2 sets of consensus criteria have been proposed for diagnosis of MCA disorder. While these criteria have some differences, both define the disorder as a chronic condition affecting 2 or more systems driven by the aberrant release of mast cell biochemical mediators. Valent and colleaguesrequire that the acute symptoms be associated with documented elevations of mast cell mediators on at least 2 occasions. Afrin and colleaguesinclude elevations in mast cell mediators (either during an acute episode or at baseline) as 1 criterion, but indicate that it is possible to fulfill diagnostic criteria without elevations in mast cell mediators.

The possibility that MCA disorder may be associated with POTS either as a trigger or as a coexisting condition is now widely accepted, but how often is unknown. This study examined the frequency with which symptoms and laboratory findings suggesting MCA disorder occurred in patients referred for POTS evaluation and who were ultimately diagnosed with POTS based upon currently published criteria.

INTRODUCTION

Mast cells (MCs) are tissue-resident, immune-regulatory effector cells involved in the initiation and perpetuation of allergic inflammation as well as in repair after tissue injury and in several other physiological processes. – In common with blood basophils, MCs express high-affinity immunoglobulin E (IgE)–binding sites (FcεRI) and store pro-inflammatory, vasoactive, and repair-supporting mediator substances in their meta-chromatic granules. – During a severe anaphylactic reaction, allergen-induced cross-linking of FcεRI on MCs induces an explosive release of granule-associated mediators. In addition, activated MCs release newly formed, cell membrane–derived (lipid-type) mediators of hypersensitivity reactions as well as newly synthesized cytokines into the extracellular space. – Blood basophils may also participate in allergies through FcεRI-dependent reactions by releasing a similar profile of mediators. However, not all hypersensitivity reactions may involve basophils, even if the reaction is systemic. Moreover, some of the relevant mediators and repair molecules are produced and released primarily by MCs but not by basophils.

The ability of MCs and basophils to liberate mediators of anaphylaxis in the context of cell activation, also known as releasability, depends on several factors, including the underlying (primary) disease/pathology, the numbers and type of activated surface receptors, the signaling pathways involved, and the genetic background. – The clinical picture and severity of an anaphylactic reaction depends on additional variables, such as the number and anatomical location of MCs involved in the reaction, amount of mediators secreted, presence and type of allergens, and triggering cofactors such as temperature, exercise, alcohol, medicines, and/or comorbidities. –

Mast cell activation may occur in a number of pathological reactions. Acute MC activation is often seen in allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions and may be associated with symptoms and signs of anaphylaxis. Severe or even life-threatening events may occur when MCs are in a hyper-reactive state and/or the burden of MCs is high. – In such patients, a mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) may be diagnosed that is confirmed by documenting the presence of MCAS criteria. – Historically, clinical symptoms arising from MC activation have primarily been studied in the context of allergic/atopic disorders. More recently, MC activation has also been analyzed in the context of other etiologies, including mastocytosis.

Histamine mediator assessment in MCAS — once released, histamine is metabolized rapidly (half-life, 1–2 minutes), primarily to N-methylhistamine. For investigating MCAS, measurement of urine N-methylhistamine levels has demonstrated little clinical utility, although increased levels can be supportive if found with other mediators such as PGD2 metabolites, and further studies are needed to evaluate how urine N-methylhistamine measurement might be optimally used for evaluation and management of MCAS.

Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) — anti-IgE, cytoreductive therapy, and kinase inhibitors are considered: Omalizumab binds free IgE, preventing its binding to FcεRI, reduces the severity and frequency of allergic reactions during aeroallergen rush immunotherapy and insect venom immunotherapy in patients with mastocytosis, and prevents spontaneous episodes of anaphylaxis in case reports and case series; therefore it should be considered in cases of MCAS resistant to mediator-targeted therapies. For patients with clonal MCAS in advanced systemic mastocytosis with signs and symptoms refractory to antimediator therapy, cytoreductive therapy should be considered, with IFN-α and cladribine among the most commonly used agents; commonly observed adverse events of IFN-α include flu-like symptoms, depression, hypothyroidism, and autoimmune disorders, and cladribine can be efficacious in advanced SM with severe life-threatening or disabling anaphylaxis but is associated with an increased risk of infection. Based on laboratory studies, inhibitors of Kit tyrosine kinase decrease MC activation and survival and might be helpful; midostaurin has activity against wild-type and D816V Kit and has been approved for treating advanced SM, and for most patients nausea can be controlled by taking ondansetron 30 to 60 minutes before midostaurin, with cytopenias managed by dose adjustment, and this agent can replace IFN-α and cladribine in the treatment paradigm for clonal MC disorders. Additional agents noted include masitinib (asthenia is a common side effect), imatinib (not indicated if the D816V mutation or another mutation at this position is present), and ibrutinib (decreases IgE-mediated reactivity but not non–IgE-mediated MC activation); current studies using an mAb targeting sialic acid–binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 8 reported reductions in eosinophil numbers and MC activation in humanized mice, but human data have not yet been published.

The umbrella term mast cell activation disease (MCAD) comprises the full spectrum of primary systemic MC disease, i.e. systemic mastocytosis (SM) which is further divided into the subtypes primary MC activation syndrome (MCAS) and MC leukemia (MCL). Aberrant release of mast cell mediators is responsible for related symptoms in mast cell activation disorders. Histamine is responsible for the immediate symptoms including headache, hypotension, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, diarrhea, and anaphylaxis. Symptoms such as cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and hypotension may be attributed to aberrant chymase release. Abdominal cramping, pulmonary edema, urticaria, bronchoconstriction, hypotension, arrhythmia, and anaphylaxis are associated with the release of platelet activating factor (PAF). Prostaglandin D2 is responsible for symptoms such as flushing, mucus secretion, bronchoconstriction, vascular instability, headache, nausea, and abdominal pain. Mast cell activation syndromes (MCAS) are a group of disorders that typically present with symptoms of MC mediator release including itching, flushing, whealing, flaring, angioedema, tachycardia, headache, and gastrointestinal manifestations such as abdominal pain and diarrhea. The proposed diagnostic criteria for MCAS include episodic recurrent symptoms consistent with MC activation in more than one organ; decrease in frequency/severity of symptoms in response to MC mediator therapy such as H1 and H2 antihistamines, leukotrienes, cromolyn, and glucocorticoids; and increased MC activation products mainly tryptase above baseline in at least two symptomatic episodes. Other MC products that can be found above normal during MCAS include heparin and chromogranin A in the blood or histamine and its metabolites (e.g. N -methylhistamine) in the urine. Lack of distinguishing cardinal signs and symptoms makes it hard to clearly distinguish mastocytosis and MCAS. Widespread distribution of MCs and various pattern of aberrant mediator expression result in a great diversity in the clinical presentation of MCAS. Generally, MCAS does not include the entire body, but may involve a specific organ, such as the bladder or GI tract. Unlike SM, urticaria and angioedema are often present in MCAS. MC shape in bone marrow differs in both diseases in which spindled MCs could be seen in mastocytosis while MCs are round and fully granulated in bone marrow specimens obtained from patients with MCAS. In patients with MCAS, hymenoptera stings, alcohol, and heat are the most common triggers of symptoms.

### Mast cell activation disorder and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: a clinical association [^5bf6f5f9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background Recently there has been increased interest in a possible association between mast cell activation (MCA) disorder and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). This study examined the frequency with which symptoms and laboratory findings suggesting MCA disorder occurred in patients diagnosed with POTS. Methods and Results Data were obtained from patients in whom symptoms and orthostatic testing were consistent with a POTS diagnosis. Individuals with < 4 months symptom duration, evident ongoing inflammatory disease, suspected volume depletion, or declined consent were excluded. All patients had typical POTS symptoms; some, however, had additional nonorthostatic complaints not usually associated with POTS. The latter patients underwent additional testing for known MCA biochemical mediators including prostaglandins, histamine, methylhistamine, and plasma tryptase. The study comprised 69 patients who met POTS diagnostic criteria. In 44 patients (44/69, 64%) additional nonorthostatic symptoms included migraine, allergic complaints, skin rash, or gastrointestinal symptoms. Of these 44 patients, 29 (66%) exhibited at least 1 laboratory abnormality suggesting MCA disorder, and 11/29 patients had 2 or more such abnormalities. Elevated prostaglandins (n = 16) or plasma histamine markers (n = 23) were the most frequent findings. Thus, 42% (29/69) of patients initially diagnosed with POTS exhibited both additional symptoms and at least 1 elevated biochemical marker suggesting MCA disorder. Conclusions Laboratory findings suggesting MCA disorder were relatively common in patients diagnosed with POTS and who present with additional nonorthostatic gastrointestinal, cutaneous, and allergic symptoms. While solitary abnormal laboratory findings are not definitive, they favor MCA disorder being considered in such cases.

Systemic mastocytosis (SM) diagnostic algorithm — patients with suspected mast cell activation symptoms or anaphylaxis and/or increased serum tryptase level, or biopsy-proven adult-onset mastocytosis in the skin (MIS) — directs evaluation with bone marrow or organ biopsy, molecular testing for KIT D816V with additional KIT gene sequencing if needed, mast cell immunophenotyping by flow cytometry and/or immunohistochemistry, and screening for FIP1L1::PDGFRA when eosinophilia is present and KIT D816V is negative; serum tryptase level may be < 20 ng/mL or only transiently elevated. Diagnostic criteria branch to diagnoses as follows: if < 3 minor SM criteria are fulfilled (KIT D816V+ and/or CD25 + mast cells), monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome (MMAS; also referred to as primary mast cell activation syndrome [MCAS]); if KIT wild-type and normal mast cell morphology/immunophenotype, consider other causes for mast cell activation or idiopathic MCAS/anaphylaxis; if at least 1 major + 1 minor criteria or ≥ 3 minor criteria per WHO or 1 major criterion or ≥ 3 minor criteria per ICC, SM (SM-2); if WHO criteria for SM not fulfilled and MIS present, cutaneous mastocytosis (CM).

### Hereditary α-tryptasemia in 101 patients with mast cell activation-related symptomatology including anaphylaxis [^69808cea]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hereditary alpha-tryptasemia (HαT) is an autosomal dominant genetic trait characterized by multiple copies of the alpha-tryptase gene at the TPSAB1 locus. Previously described symptomatology involves multiple organ systems and anaphylaxis. The spectrum of mast cell activation symptoms is unknown, as is its association with specific genotypes.

Objective

To describe clinical, laboratory, and genetic characteristics of patients referred for the evaluation of mast cell activation-related symptoms and genotype-confirmed HαT.

Methods

We retrospectively describe clinical characteristics, baseline tryptase, and tryptase genotype in 101 patients. Patients were referred for mast cell activation-related symptoms and underwent genotyping to confirm diagnosis of HαT.

Results

Of 101 patients, 80% were female with average tryptase of 17.2 ng/mL. Tryptase was less than 11.4 ng/mL in 8.9% and greater than 20 ng/mL in 22.3% (range 6.2–51.3 ng/mL). KIT D816V mutation was negative in all subjects tested. 2α:3β was the most common genotype but did not correlate with tryptase levels. Unprovoked anaphylaxis was noted in 57% of the subjects with heterogeneous genotypes. Most common symptoms include gastrointestinal, cutaneous, psychiatric, pulmonary, cardiovascular, and neurologic. A total of 85% of patients were taking H 1 - or H 2 -antihistamines with partial symptom relief. Omalizumab was effective at suppressing anaphylaxis or urticaria in 94% of the patients.

Conclusion

HαT encompasses a broad range of baseline tryptase and should be considered in patients with symptoms of mast cell activation and tryptase levels greater than 6.2 ng/mL. Patients may present with complex symptomatology including cutaneous, gastrointestinal, neurologic, and psychiatric symptoms and anaphylaxis, some of which respond to omalizumab.

### Gastrointestinal manifestations of hypereosinophilic syndromes and mast cell disorders: a comprehensive review [^3ea0b4e4]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypereosinophilic syndrome and mastocytosis are relatively rare proliferative diseases encountered in the general population. However, allergists frequently consider these disorders in the differential of patients presenting with gastrointestinal, pulmonary, cutaneous, and allergic symptoms. Gastrointestinal symptoms are some of the most frequent and/or debilitating aspects of both disease states and in many cases lead to poor quality of life and functional limitation for the patient. They are the third most common clinical manifestation in hypereosinophilic syndrome and have been found to be the most distressful aspect of the disorder in those with systemic mastocytosis. Both eosinophils and mast cells play integral parts in normal gut physiology, but when and how exactly their effector functionality translates into clinically significant disease remains unclear, and the available literature regarding their pathophysiology remains sparse. Eosinophils and mast cells even, in fact, may not necessarily function in isolation from each other but can participate in bidirectional crosstalk. Both are affected by similar mediators and can also influence one another in a paracrine fashion. Their interactions include both production of soluble mediators for specific eosinophil and mast cell receptors (for example, eosinophil recruitment and activation by mast cells releasing histamine and eotaxin) as well as direct physical contact. The mechanistic relationship between clonal forms of hypereosinophilia and systemic mastocytosis has also been explored. The nature of gastrointestinal symptomatology in the setting of both hypereosinophilic syndrome and mast cell disease is frequently manifold, heterogeneous, and the lack of better targeted therapy makes diagnosis and management challenging, especially when faced with a substantial differential. Currently, the management of these gastrointestinal symptoms relies on the treatment of the overall disease process. In hypereosinophilia patients, systemic corticosteroids are mainstay, although steroid-sparing agents such as hydroxyurea, IFN-α, methotrexate, cyclosporine, imatinib, and mepolizumab have been utilized with varying success. In mastocytosis patients, anti-mediator therapy with antihistamines and mast cell stabilization with cromolyn sodium can be considered treatments of choice, followed by other therapies yet to be thoroughly studied, including the role of the low-histamine diet, corticosteroids, and treatment of associated IBS symptoms. Given that both eosinophils and mast cells may have joint pathophysiologic roles, they have the potential to be a combined target for therapeutic intervention in disease states exhibiting eosinophil or mast cell involvement.

Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) — other agents targeting mast cell mediators: Omalizumab has cases indicating prevention of anaphylactic episodes in some patients with MCAS or SM or in those who cannot otherwise tolerate needed insect venom immunotherapy. Cysteinyl leukotriene inhibitor (eg, montelukast) or 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor (zileuton) agents might reduce bronchospasm or gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with MCAS or SM, particularly if urinary LTE4 levels are increased, but they are not well studied. Cyproheptadine is a sedating H1 antihistamine with extended anticholinergic and antiserotonergic activities and might help gastrointestinal symptoms. Ketotifen is a sedating H1R antagonist approved in the United States for allergic eye disease that can be compounded as tablets, but whether it is beneficial beyond other antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine, is unproved.

### Acute / baseline ratios of all 3 MC mediator metabolites can enhance diagnosis and management of mast cell activation syndrome [^37a7a1ca]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Mast cell (MC) activation syndrome (MCAS) can be a challenge to diagnose and treat despite the near continuous appearance of publications outlining specific criteria. Follow-up of the clinical responses to treatment is often lacking, and confirmation that leukotriene C 4 (LTC 4) is an active participant in MCAS has been overlooked.

Objective

Three patients with MCAS characterized by anaphylaxis are presented to illustrate (1) the value of contemporaneous urinary mediator sampling during MCAS in addition to serum tryptase measurements and (2) substantiation of the fact that not only can LTC 4 (measured metabolite LTE 4) be the highest metabolite measured, but (3) blockade of the LTE 4 receptor can contribute to symptom prevention.

Method

The study methods comprised clinical review and quantitation of acute and baseline levels of tryptase and urinary MC mediators.

Results

The cases of 3 patients with MCAS are reviewed. In the first case, vespid sting–induced anaphylaxis was associated with a marked increase in the LTE 4 excretion. The addition of montelukast was instituted, and subsequent stings did not evoke symptoms. In the second case, acute measurements showed substantial increased levels of (2,3-dinor)-11β-prostaglandin F 2α, and LTE 4. The addition of aspirin plus montelukast prevented subsequent attacks. The third case documents a perioperative anaphylactic event with an acute/baseline LTE 4 ratio far higher than those of tryptase or other metabolites.

Conclusions

The value of measuring all 3 MC mediator metabolites during MCAS should not be overlooked. These measurements can facilitate the successful prevention of attacks. Furthermore, results from these tests show that histamine is often a minor player, whereas acute/baseline levels of the metabolites of LTC 4 and prostaglandin D 2 are frequently much higher, warranting nonantihistamine treatment.

### Acute / baseline ratios of all 3 MC mediator metabolites can enhance diagnosis and management of mast cell activation syndrome [^cb8dcebf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Key messages

- Episodes of anaphylaxis have an acute/baseline rise in the serum tryptase level greater than 1.685; however, the accompanying increases in levels of 3 urinary MC mediator metabolites are only sparsely reported in these cases.
- The acute/baseline ratios of the urinary metabolite of LTC 4 (LTE 4) can exceed metabolites of both histamine and PGD 2, as well as that of serum tryptase during anaphylaxis.
- In addition to measuring urinary excretion of both histamine and PGD 2 metabolites, documentation of acute/baseline urinary levels of LTE 4, is warranted in patients with anaphylaxis and can contribute to therapeutic options for these patients.

### The relationship between hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS), postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), and mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) [^81164646]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

In recent years, an association between hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS), mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) has garnered attention and patients are increasingly presenting with this triad. However, a real relationship between these entities is unclear due to a lack of scientific validity. We conducted an extensive review of the literature using two different search strategies. A narrower strategy included 88 searches of various combinations of terms for each of the three conditions, yielding 19 unique papers. A broader search included 136 searches of various combinations of terms but included all forms of EDS and yielded 40 unique papers. Of these, only four and nine papers from the narrower and broader search strategies were original research articles. None of these papers resulted from a combination of the search terms for the three conditions. All three clinical entities are controversial in either existence or pathogenesis. MCAS is a poorly defined clinical entity, and many studies do not adhere to the proposed criteria when establishing the diagnosis. Patients previously diagnosed with EDS hypermobility type may not meet the new, stricter criteria for hEDS but may for a less severe hypermobility spectrum disorder (HSD). The pathophysiology of POTS is still unclear. An evidence-based, common pathophysiologic mechanism between any of the two, much less all three conditions, has yet to be described. Our review of the literature shows that current evidence is lacking on the existence of MCAS or hEDS as separate or significant clinical entities. Studies proposing a relationship between the three clinical entities are either biased or based on outdated criteria. The reason behind the purported association of these entities stems from an overlapping pool of vague, subjective symptoms, which is inadequate evidence to conclude that any such relationship exists.

Regarding methylhistamine, Shibao et al.noted that urinary methylhistamine is usually normal between flares in patients with MCA. Patients should be instructed to collect urine for a 4‐hour period immediately after a severe spontaneous flushing episode. Urine histamine is often measured in the evaluation of flushing but has been considered to be less specific than methylhistamine and less useful in the diagnosis of MCA.

Clinical Differences: Typical POTS Presentation Versus That Associated With Suspected MCA

In its original description, POTS was primarily characterized by symptoms that were provoked on standing, and that were relieved by recumbence. Subsequently, nonpostural symptoms have become accepted as part of the clinical picture. The principal resulting orthostatic symptoms are palpitations, fatigue, lightheadedness (including "brain fog"), and near‐syncope. Common nonorthostatic symptoms include nausea, diminished concentration, and tremulousness. However, patients exhibiting MCA disorder may manifest similar complaints.

In our study, palpitations were observed in almost all patients, and the combination of lightheadedness/dizziness/brain fog was the next most common symptom. Furthermore, the frequency of these symptoms did not differ between patients with suspected MCA and patients with POTS. Consequently, one cannot distinguish between these 2 patient groups by conventional symptoms alone. On the other hand, certain symptoms (particularly allergy, gastrointestinal issues, and skin rash/flushing) tended to be more frequent in patients with MCA; these may be helpful diagnostically but must be actively sought for during the history‐taking.,

Initially, greater migraine frequency appeared to distinguish the MCA group from the typical patients with POTS (Table 1). Furthermore, this difference persisted when patients with MCA were compared only with the smaller group of typical patients with POTS in whom laboratory testing results were normal (Table 3); however, the difference was no longer statistically significant. Thus, although release of multiple neurohormones from mast cells (eg, adenylate cycles activating pituitary polypeptide, histamine, and others) provides biologic plausibility for more frequent migraine in MCA, the role of migraine as a clinically differentiating feature cannot be relied upon; further study is needed.

### Mast cell activation disorder and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: a clinical association [^c550d5f5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Patients with MCA disorder may have symptoms suggestive of POTS. However, in these cases one may anticipate that the clinical presentation will be characterized by a broader symptom profile than is the case with typical POTS. In particular, the presence of allergic reactions, gastrointestinal complaints, and to a lesser extent skin disturbances should lead to considering MCA. While no single laboratory finding provides an assured diagnostic marker, the presence of an elevated prostaglandin (prostaglandin D2 and/or F2 alpha), especially in conjunction with an increased second marker such as histamine or less often tryptase, suggests that MCA disorder may be responsible for the POTS‐like symptoms.

### Clustering of clinical symptoms using large language models reveals low diagnostic specificity of proposed alternatives to consensus mast cell activation syndrome criteria [^f58c8f40]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background:

The rate of diagnosis of mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) has increased since the disorder's original description as a mastocytosis-like phenotype. While a set of consortium MCAS criteria is well described and widely accepted, this increase occurs in the setting of a broader set of proposed alternative MCAS criteria.

Objective:

Effective diagnostic criteria must minimize the range of unrelated diagnoses that can be erroneously classified as the condition of interest. We sought to determine if the symptoms associated with alternative MCAS criteria result in less concise or consistent diagnostic alternatives, reducing diagnostic specificity.

Methods:

We used multiple large language models, including ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, to bootstrap the probabilities of diagnoses that are compatible with consortium or alternative MCAS criteria. We utilized diversity and network analysis to quantify diagnostic precision and specificity compared to control diagnostic criteria including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Kawasaki disease, and migraines.

Results:

Compared to consortium MCAS criteria, alternative MCAS criteria are associated with more variable (Shannon diversity 5.8 vs. 4.6, respectively; p-value = 0.004) and less precise (mean Bray-Curtis similarity 0.07 vs 0.19, respectively; p-value = 0.004) diagnoses. The diagnosis networks derived from consortium and alternative MCAS criteria had lower between-network similarity compared to the similarity between diagnosis networks derived from two distinct SLE criteria (cosine similarity 0.55 vs. 0.86, respectively; p-value = 0.0022).

Conclusion:

Alternative MCAS criteria are associated with a distinct set of diagnoses compared to consortium MCAS criteria and have lower diagnostic consistency. This lack of specificity is pronounced in relation to multiple control criteria, raising the concern that alternative criteria could disproportionately contribute to MCAS overdiagnosis, to the exclusion of more appropriate diagnoses.

### Personalized diagnostic approach and indirect quantification of extravasation in human anaphylaxis [^6fbadd93]. Allergy (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Anaphylaxis is the most severe acute manifestation of allergic disorders, being a life‐threatening systemic hypersensitivity reaction that develops rapidly. Currently, 50–112 cases per 100,000 inhabitants are registered per year, but its incidence seems to be underestimated.

Ongoing criteria for diagnosing anaphylaxis are clinical. However, the plethora of clinical features associated with this pathological event makes it difficult to achieve a consensus on its definition, impairing our ability to adequately manage these severe reactions. Different phenotypes and underlying endotypes have been described in anaphylaxis according to a few biomarkers, being serum tryptase the most widely used to complement the diagnosis of this pathological event.

In recent years, the upper normality reference threshold concentration for serum tryptase has decreased from 15 μg/L to 11.4 μg/L. However, this biomarker has several drawbacks since it is not elevated in all cases, but mainly in most severe reactions, where clinical diagnosis is undoubtful. Therefore, new diagnostic criteria have been proposed. For instance, an increase in tryptase levels of 20% plus 2 μg/L from baseline to the acute phase is used to diagnose mast cell activation syndrome. In addition, the study of Borer‐Reinhold et al. established an increase above 135% of acute serum tryptase baseline values to indicate cell mast activation in patients with anaphylaxis to Hymenoptera venoms.

### Restless legs syndrome is associated with mast cell activation syndrome [^d2aa1a21]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) is an inflammatory and allergic disorder. We determined the prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in MCAS because each common syndrome may be inflammatory in nature and associated with dysautonomia.

Methods

Individuals with MCAS were evaluated for RLS by two standard questionnaires. Prevalence comparisons included spouse control patients and two prevalence publications. MCAS diagnosis required mast cell (MC) symptoms in ≥ 2 organs plus ≥ 1 elevated MC mediators, improvement with MC therapy, and/or increased intestinal MC density. Clinical variables were studied.

Results

There were 174 patients with MCAS (146 female, 28 male, mean age 44.8 years) and 85 spouse control patients (12 female, 73 male, mean age 50.9 years). Patients with MCAS as a whole had a higher prevalence of RLS (40.8%) than spouse control (12.9%) (P < .0001) Male patients with MCAS had a higher prevalence of RLS (32.1%) than male controls (12.3%, odds ratio [OR] 3.4, confidence interval [CI] 1.2–9.7, P = 0.025), American men (8.4%, OR 5.2, CI 2.2–12.0, P < .001), and French men (5.8%, OR 7.7, CI 3.4–17.1, P < .001). Female patients with MCAS also had a higher prevalence of RLS (42.5%) than female controls (16.7%) but this did not reach statistical significance perhaps because of the sample size of the female controls. However, female patients with MCAS had a statistically higher prevalence of RLS than American women (10.0%, OR 6.7, CI 4.5–9.7, P < .0001) and French women (10.8%, OR 6.1, CI 4.4–8.6, P < .0001).

Conclusions

RLS appears to be associated with MCAS. Effects of mast cell mediators, inflammation, immune mechanisms, dysautonomia, or hypoxia may theoretically activate RLS in MCAS.

### Challenges to delivering evidence-based management for long COVID [^6f9fb7e9]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The heterogeneity of long COVID results in a single or complex presentation of ailmentswith over 200 symptoms reported, affecting every organ system in the body, irrespective of the viral variant and vaccination status. Patients with long COVID may have residual symptoms, worsening of existing symptoms or the development of new symptoms at any time following acute infection, unrelated to initial disease severity. Zhang et al 's study identified four reproducible PASC subphenotypes, dominated by cardiac and renal; respiratory, sleep and anxiety; musculoskeletal and nervous system; and digestive and respiratory system sequelae. These subphenotypes were associated with distinct patient demographics, underlying conditions before SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute infection phase severity. These constellation of symptoms are also seen in chronic disease, in patients with severe illness following critical care, known as post-intensive care syndromeor as a delayed complication such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Longitudinal studies have shown that patients feel better through time, but some studies have documented an impairment of daily activities for longer than 1–2 years. Among this heterogeneous presentation, distinct subtypes have been identified to support the integration of individuals into specific care pathways.

There is still an open debate as to what entails long COVID, including confusion over appropriate terminology, due to the heterogeneous phenotypes, multiple case definitions, lack of a specific diagnostic, exacerbation of existing conditions (eg, diabetes mellitus), and because there is a significant overlap with other chronic conditions such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and mast cell activation syndrome.

Both POTS and small fibre neuropathy are commonly seen in long COVID, where POTS often occurs following a viral infectionand is most often comorbid with ME/CSF. There is evidence that autonomic dysfunction may contribute to long COVIDas it does in ME/CFS. There is also evidence that, as in ME/CFS, autoantibodies may be contributing to long COVID. When various factors (eg, infection, injury, cold temperatures, lack of sufficient nutrients) threaten the viability of a cell or of an organism, it may give rise to ME/CSF. Although many patients with ME/CSF report a prodrome consistent with infection, no single agent is consistently implicated. A diagnosis of ME/CFS is based on symptoms as there is no specific diagnostic test with adequate sensitivity and specificity.

### Mast cell activation disorder and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: a clinical association [^07e4f711]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

As noted above, 2 relatively recent consensus reports provide diagnostic criteria for identification of MCA‐related syndromes. Both reports advocate identifying clinical and laboratory markers in order to establish an MCA diagnosis. Specifically, Afrin et alrecommend relying on (1) symptoms that are consistent with MCA, (2) signs/symptoms involving at least 2 organ systems, and (3) absence of other explanatory disease state. In terms of laboratory findings, Valent et alemphasize the important diagnostic specificity associated with elevated tryptase levels; however, tryptase was an insensitive marker in our patients. In any event, both consensus reports offer elements of flexibility in establishing an MCA diagnosis. In particular, Valent et al acknowledge that prostaglandin D2 is acceptable when tryptase is not substantially elevated. The approach offered by Afrin et al.acknowledges the validity of histamine markers. Consequently, our diagnostic algorithm combined criteria from both consensus documents as a reasonable compromise for MCA diagnosis.

Laboratory findings have important limitations in the recognition of MCA. Specifically, although mast cells produce many mediators, at present, most can be measured only in research laboratories. Of the minority that can be measured in clinical laboratories, many may be derived from cell types other than mast cells. Nevertheless, there are some mediators that are relatively mast cell specific. Examples include tryptase, histamine, prostaglandin D2, 2,3‐dinor‐11beta‐prostaglandin F2α (a metabolite of prostaglandin D2), and heparin.

Tryptase is a protein derived primarily from mast cells and would be expected to be increased in MCA disorder as it is in systemic mastocytosis. However, in our population tryptase was only infrequently abnormal. Potentially, elevated tryptase levels may be transient, and only elevated during or shortly after an MCA flare. Thus, Kacar et al.reported that serum tryptase levels were periodically elevated, ranging from 10 ng/mL to 20 ng/mL between attacks, but increasing to > 100 ng/mL following episodes of anaphylaxis. Similarly, Akin et al. reported a level of 8 ng/mL or greater detected within 4 hours of a suspected anaphylactic event, a finding that confirms that MCA has occurred in that patient. Consequently, to ascertain a potential role for tryptase in MCA, levels are best measured within 4 hours after a suspected MCA event.

### AGA clinical practice update on GI manifestations and autonomic or immune dysfunction in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: expert review [^7a4190db]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, more specifically with respect to management of gastrointestinal symptoms, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider treating suspected mast cell activation syndrome with histamine receptor antagonists and/or mast cell stabilizers. Advise avoiding triggers such as certain foods, alcohol, strong smells, temperature changes, mechanical stimuli (friction), emotional distress (pollen, mold), or specific medications (opioids, NSAIDs, iodinated contrast).

### Hyperadrenergic postural tachycardia syndrome in mast cell activation disorders [^00fbd27a]. Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a disabling condition that commonly affects otherwise normal young females. Because these patients can present with a flushing disorder, we hypothesized that mast cell activation (MCA) can contribute to its pathogenesis. Here we describe POTS patients with MCA (MCA+POTS), diagnosed by episodes of flushing and abnormal increases in urine methylhistamine, and compared them to POTS patients with episodic flushing but normal urine methylhistamine and to normal healthy age-matched female controls. MCA+POTS patients were characterized by episodes of flushing, shortness of breath, headache, lightheadedness, excessive diuresis, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Triggering events include long-term standing, exercise, premenstrual cycle, meals, and sexual intercourse. In addition, patients were disabled by orthostatic intolerance and a characteristic hyperadrenergic response to posture, with orthostatic tachycardia (from 79 ± 4 to 114 ± 6 bpm), increased systolic blood pressure on standing (from 117 ± 5 to 126 ± 7 mm Hg versus no change in POTS controls), increased systolic blood pressure at the end of phase II of the Valsalva maneuver (157 ± 12 versus 117 ± 9 in normal controls and 119 ± 7 mm Hg in POTS; P = 0.048), and an exaggerated phase IV blood pressure overshoot (50 ± 10 versus 17 ± 3 mm Hg in normal controls; P < 0.05). In conclusion, MCA should be considered in patients with POTS presenting with flushing. These patients often present with a typical hyperadrenergic response, but beta-blockers should be used with great caution, if at all, and treatment directed against mast cell mediators may be required.
