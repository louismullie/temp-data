## Question

Why my leg fingers are struck?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why their "leg fingers" (toes) are "struck" (likely meaning stuck, stiff, or immobile). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the symptom and its distribution. Then, I should categorize the differential diagnosis by pathophysiology. Next, I will prioritize the most likely causes and outline red flags that warrant urgent care. After that, I will suggest a focused diagnostic workup. Finally, I will provide initial management strategies and counseling points, making sure I verify each claim against the best available evidence as I go.

> Let me first confirm the symptom and its pattern. "Leg fingers" almost certainly refers to toes, and "struck" most plausibly reflects stiffness, reduced range of motion, or a fixed deformity rather than transient cramping, so I should confirm whether the problem is unilateral or bilateral, symmetric or asymmetric, painful or painless, and whether there is associated numbness, tingling, weakness, or skin changes, because these features will steer the differential toward neuropathic, musculoskeletal, vascular, or infectious etiologies.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should organize the differential by mechanism. The major buckets include neuropathic causes such as diabetic or other distal symmetric polyneuropathies, musculoskeletal causes like hammertoe or other toe deformities, vascular causes including peripheral artery disease or vasculopathy, infectious or inflammatory causes such as COVID toes or cellulitis, and medication-induced or systemic causes like chemotherapy-induced neuropathy or drug-induced vasculopathy, keeping in mind that overlap is common in diabetes and other chronic diseases [^116ZaC5W] [^117UPaZm] [^111rbgEN] [^1119sAFW] [^116ZaC5W].

> I will now examine the most likely neuropathic explanation. Diabetic neuropathy is the leading cause of distal symmetric polyneuropathy in Western populations, typically presenting with numbness, tingling, burning, or dysesthesias that start in the toes and progress proximally, and it can lead to intrinsic muscle atrophy and toe deformities such as hammertoes, which would explain a "stuck" or stiff toe from motor involvement and contractures; importantly, up to half of cases can be asymptomatic, so absence of pain does not exclude it, and early recognition is critical to prevent ulcers and amputations [^116ZaC5W] [^1119DquR] [^112t3D2w].

> Wait, let me verify the musculoskeletal angle. Hammertoe deformity arises from an imbalance of flexor and extensor tendons and intrinsic muscles, often compounded by neuropathy, ill-fitting shoes, or trauma; as the deformity progresses, the proximal interphalangeal joint becomes rigid, producing a fixed, "stuck" toe that may be painful with shoe pressure and prone to corns or calluses, which fits the description of a toe that will not straighten voluntarily [^117UPaZm].

> Next, I should review vascular causes. Peripheral artery disease can cause ischemia with claudication, rest pain, and tissue loss, and in chronic limb-threatening ischemia, toe stiffness or contracture may reflect ischemic muscle fibrosis or gangrene; toe pressures less than 30 mmHg are concerning for nonhealing and should prompt urgent vascular evaluation, particularly in people with diabetes or smoking history [^111rbgEN] [^113zPft4] [^113zPft4].

> But wait, what if this is medication-related. Several drug classes can cause peripheral vasculopathy or neuropathy that manifests in the toes, including stimulants such as methylphenidate and amphetamines, triptans like sumatriptan, and ergots like dihydroergotamine; symptoms include numbness, coolness, color change, and even ischemic injury, so I need to check for new or recent exposure to these agents and counsel immediate cessation and evaluation if suspected [^114hqJKL] [^112gDQy9] [^112YX3zN] [^116bdm6i].

> I should also consider infectious or inflammatory mimics. COVID toes present as pernio-like lesions with erythema, swelling, and sometimes pain or numbness; while often self-limited, they can be confused with ischemia or vasculitis, so I need to correlate with exposure history and, if uncertain, consider rheumatology or dermatology input to exclude vasculitis or other inflammatory vasculopathies [^1119sAFW] [^111ZyRUh].

> Let me think about red flags that mandate urgent care. Acute painful pallor or cyanosis with coldness, new ulcers or gangrene, rapidly progressive weakness, or systemic infection signs require same-day evaluation for acute limb ischemia, infection, or severe neuropathy; in diabetes, even minor trauma with loss of protective sensation can deteriorate quickly, so I should advise prompt emergency assessment if any of these are present [^111rbgEN] [^113BZSED].

> Next, I should review a focused diagnostic approach. I need to check for diabetes and prediabetes with fasting glucose or HbA1c and consider a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test if small-fiber symptoms are present, because impaired glucose tolerance can cause neuropathy even with normal fasting glucose; I should also assess vitamin B12 with metabolites, thyroid function, and consider serum protein electrophoresis if atypical features arise, while reserving nerve conduction studies for suspected large-fiber involvement and skin biopsy for small-fiber neuropathy when indicated [^116ZaC5W] [^116UHR15].

> For the physical examination, I should confirm a careful foot exam including inspection for deformities such as hammertoe, calluses, ulcers, and nail changes; test protective sensation with a 10-g monofilament and at least one additional modality such as pinprick or vibration; palpate dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses; and screen for autonomic signs like dryness or temperature asymmetry, because these findings help distinguish neuropathic from purely vascular or musculoskeletal etiologies and guide urgency of referral [^111rbgEN] [^112t3D2w].

> I need to ensure I address management pathways by cause. For diabetic or idiopathic neuropathy, optimize glycemic control, institute foot care education, and treat neuropathic pain with first-line agents such as gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine, or tricyclics; for hammertoe, start with footwear modification, orthoses, and stretching, and refer to podiatry or orthopedics if fixed or painful; for suspected PAD, obtain ankle-brachial and toe pressures and refer urgently if toe pressure is under 30 mmHg or if there is tissue loss; for medication-induced vasculopathy, stop the offending drug and monitor for resolution; for COVID toes, supportive care and exclusion of alternative diagnoses is typical, with dermatology input if persistent or atypical [^116ZaC5W] [^117UPaZm] [^111rbgEN] [^113zPft4] [^1119sAFW].

> Hold on, I should verify preventive counseling points. Daily foot inspection, gentle cleansing, moisturization avoiding the interdigital spaces, nail care, and prompt reporting of redness, swelling, calluses, or wounds are essential in diabetes and neuropathy to prevent ulcers and amputations; I should also reinforce smoking cessation, weight optimization, and blood pressure control to mitigate both neuropathic and vascular risks [^112t3D2w] [^113BZSED].

> In summary, I need to ensure the working diagnosis aligns with the clinical pattern. Given the distal location and the description of a "stuck" toe, the most likely explanations are hammertoe deformity from neuropathic or biomechanical causes, diabetic or other distal symmetric polyneuropathy with secondary deformity, or medication-induced vasculopathy; less likely but important considerations include PAD with ischemic contracture, COVID toes, or inflammatory vasculitis, and the next steps are to clarify symmetry, pain, sensory loss, pulses, skin changes, medication exposures, and diabetes risk, then proceed with targeted labs, foot exam, and vascular studies as indicated to confirm the etiology and prevent complications [^116ZaC5W] [^117UPaZm] [^111rbgEN] [^1119sAFW].

Your toes are likely "stuck" due to **hammertoe or mallet toe** deformities from muscle/tendon imbalance, often worsened by tight shoes or neuropathy [^117UPaZm]. Other causes include **arthritis, nerve compression, or injury**. Management includes footwear changes, orthotics, and exercises; surgery is reserved for severe or rigid cases. See a clinician if stiffness, pain, or skin changes persist or worsen.

---

## Common causes of stuck toes

Several conditions can cause toes to become stuck or immobile:

- **Hammertoe and mallet toe deformities**: These are common deformities characterized by abnormal bending of the toe joints, causing the toe to resemble a hammer or mallet. They result from muscle and tendon imbalances, often exacerbated by ill-fitting footwear, trauma, or underlying medical conditions such as diabetes or arthritis [^117UPaZm].

- **Arthritis**: Osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis can cause joint inflammation, stiffness, and deformity, leading to restricted toe movement [^notfound].

- **Neuromuscular disorders**: Conditions such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease or diabetic neuropathy can cause muscle weakness and imbalance, resulting in toe deformities and stiffness [^112Y2F6Y].

- **Nerve compression**: Conditions like tarsal tunnel syndrome or Morton's neuroma can cause nerve compression, leading to pain, numbness, and restricted movement of the toes [^111QAvBe] [^1145ouhX].

- **Trauma or injury**: Previous fractures, dislocations, or severe sprains can cause permanent joint damage, leading to stiffness and immobility of the toes.

---

## Symptoms associated with stuck toes

Individuals with stuck toes may experience the following symptoms:

- **Stiffness or rigidity**: Difficulty bending or straightening the affected toe(s).

- **Pain or discomfort**: Especially when wearing shoes or walking.

- **Swelling or inflammation**: Around the affected joint(s).

- **Corns or calluses**: Due to friction and pressure from footwear.

- **Redness or warmth**: Indicating inflammation or infection.

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A thorough clinical evaluation is essential to determine the underlying cause of stuck toes. The diagnostic process may include:

- **Physical examination**: Assessing toe alignment, range of motion, and presence of corns, calluses, or skin changes [^111rbgEN].

- **Medical history**: Documenting any trauma, systemic conditions (e.g. diabetes, arthritis), or family history of neuromuscular disorders [^111rbgEN].

- **Imaging studies**: X-rays to assess joint alignment, bone structure, and presence of arthritis or deformities.

- **Neurological assessment**: Evaluating nerve function and identifying any neuropathies or nerve compression syndromes [^116ZaC5W].

---

## Treatment options

Treatment for stuck toes depends on the underlying cause, severity, and patient preferences. Conservative management is often recommended initially, with surgical intervention reserved for severe or refractory cases:

| **Treatment modality** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Conservative management | - Footwear modifications (wide-toe box shoes, low heels) <br/> - Orthotic devices (toe splints, pads) <br/> - Physical therapy (stretching, strengthening exercises) <br/> - Medications (NSAIDs for pain and inflammation) [^116sXxzw] |
| Surgical intervention | - Tendon release or lengthening <br/> - Joint fusion (arthrodesis) <br/> - Joint replacement (arthroplasty) <br/> - Removal of bone prominences or corns [^117UPaZm] |

---

## Potential complications

If left untreated, stuck toes can lead to several complications, including:

- **Chronic pain**: Persistent discomfort affecting mobility and quality of life.

- **Skin complications**: Corns, calluses, and ulcerations due to friction and pressure [^117UPaZm].

- **Infection**: Risk of bacterial infection, particularly in individuals with diabetes or compromised immune systems [^113BZSED].

- **Permanent deformity**: Progressive joint stiffness and deformity, potentially requiring surgical intervention [^117UPaZm].

---

## Preventive measures

Preventive strategies can help reduce the risk of developing stuck toes:

- **Proper footwear**: Wearing shoes with adequate toe space, low heels, and good arch support [^117UPaZm].

- **Foot hygiene**: Regular inspection of the feet, moisturizing, and prompt treatment of corns or calluses [^1116L15e].

- **Exercise**: Stretching and strengthening exercises to maintain joint flexibility and muscle balance.

- **Weight management**: Maintaining a healthy weight to reduce stress on the feet and toes.

---

## When to seek medical attention

It is advisable to seek medical attention if:

- **Persistent stiffness or pain**: Lasting more than a few weeks.

- **Visible deformity**: Noticeable changes in toe alignment or shape.

- **Skin changes**: Redness, swelling, or ulceration.

- **Difficulty walking**: Significant impairment in mobility or daily activities.

---

Stuck toes are most often due to hammertoe or mallet toe deformities from muscle/tendon imbalance, but arthritis, nerve compression, and injury can also contribute. Most cases improve with **conservative care** (proper shoes, orthotics, exercises), while severe or rigid deformities may need surgery. Early evaluation helps prevent pain, skin breakdown, and permanent deformity.

### New insights into diabetic polyneuropathy [^116UHR15]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Patients with complaints of numbness, tingling, and dysesthesias in the toes and feet are frequently referred to neurologists. Often, the only objective evidence for peripheral nerve dysfunction in these patients is limited to small-caliber sensory nerve fibers. On examination these patients may have reduced distal pinprick sensation, and distal leg skin biopsies show loss of small-caliber nerve fibers. Studies focusing on small-caliber nerve fibers have led to a growing impression that neuropathy can be associated with early diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Often, neuropathy can be the presenting symptom of either diabetes or IGT. Furthermore, the oral glucose tolerance test appears to be a more sensitive measure of glucose dysmetabolism in these patients than levels of fasting blood glucose or glycated hemoglobin. Patients with IGT-associated neuropathy may represent an attractive target population for future regenerative studies given that their neuropathy is less severe and presumably more easily reversed than neuropathy occurring in patients with diabetes. Historically, small-caliber fibers have not been extensively evaluated due to a lack of objective measures. Several measures to evaluate these fibers are emerging, including skin biopsy with visualization of epidermal nerve fibers. The accessibility of epidermal nerve fibers makes them an attractive target for nerve injury models, which have potential for development as novel outcome measures. Such approaches may address some of the challenges of past diabetic polyneuropathy trials.

### Low back pain [^113h3ASB]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2012). Medium credibility.

Low back pain — prevalence, risk factors, and physical therapy treatments are described, noting that 8 of 10 people experience it at some time in their lives and that pain is usually felt in the lower back and buttocks with possible leg pain and numbness and tingling in the toes; lifestyle risks include sitting too much, being in poor physical condition, and bending and lifting improperly, and stress and lack of sleep can make the pain worse. Evidence suggests that early treatment for low back pain is helpful in decreasing the chance that your pain will become chronic. Not all low back pain should be treated the same, and a physical therapist can help determine if you will respond better to manipulation or to exercises to improve mobility and/or strengthen your back muscles. New clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of low back pain were published in the April 2012 issue of JOSPT, describing ways to treat back pain based on best research evidence.

### Additive effects of numbness and muscle aches on fatigue occurrence in individuals with HIV / AIDS who are taking antiretroviral therapy [^111Kq54d]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2011). Low credibility.

Context

Muscle aches, numbness in the feet/toes (neuropathy), and fatigue are often reported concurrently and are among the symptoms most frequently reported by individuals with HIV/AIDS, whether or not they are taking antiretroviral therapy (ART).

Objectives

This study used a longitudinal analytical methodology to analyze these symptoms together to determine whether symptom clusters are maintained over time and to determine whether there is a temporal relationship between fatigue and reports of neuropathic pain and muscle aches.

Methods

This was a secondary analysis of a subset of data from a six-month, longitudinal, randomized, controlled trial of 243 HIV-positive individuals taking ART. Self-reported symptom frequency and intensity were recorded using the Revised Sign and Symptom Checklist for Persons with HIV disease at baseline (Month 0), one, three, and six months. Multilevel, logistic regression models were used to analyze time-lagged effects of muscle aches, numbness of the feet/toes, and fatigue to estimate any predictive and interactive effects that the symptoms have upon one another.

Results

A significant relationship between muscle aches and fatigue intercepts was noted (odds ratio [OR] = 1.80, P ≤ 0.05). Significant relationships between numbness and fatigue also were noted for the entire measurement period (OR = 2.70, P ≤ 0.05). Time-lagged models showed persons reporting neuropathic-related numbness in one period were nearly twice as likely to report fatigue in subsequent periods (OR = 1.89, P ≤ 0.05). The final model revealed that the addition of muscle aches and numbness explained 28% of the random variance in the occurrence of fatigue. Between-person descriptive variables including years living with HIV, age, having an AIDS diagnosis, ethnicity, and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor treatment regimens with stavudine, zalactabine, or didanosine did not significantly explain any additional model variation.

Conclusion

These findings are consistent with physiological research and provide evidence that analyzing multiple symptom change over time can provide a more accurate representation of an individual's symptom experience. When evaluating patients with muscle aches or numbness, particularly when both symptoms are present, an evaluation of fatigue should be considered. Similarly, if fatigue is reported, underlying physiological assessments for neuropathic symptoms and muscle aches may be considered.

### Distal symmetric polyneuropathy: a review [^112Y2F6Y]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on distal symmetric polyneuropathy:

- **Definition**: Distal symmetric polyneuropathy is diffuse length-dependent peripheral neuropathy characterized by numbness, tingling, pain, and/or weakness that typically starts in the toes and spreads proximally.
- **Pathophysiology**: Distal symmetric polyneuropathy is most commonly caused due to diabetes (32–53%), idiopathic reasons (24–27%), alcohol, vitamin B 12 deficiency, chemotherapy, CKD, paraproteinemia, and inherited conditions (hammertoes, high arches, Charcot Marie Tooth). Other causes include pre-diabetes, infections, inflammation, toxins, autoimmunity, neoplasms, and paraneoplasms.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of distal symmetrical polyneuropathy include numbness, tingling, pain, starting in the toes with proximal spread, decreased pinprick and vibration sensation in a stocking-glove distribution, decreased reflexes starting at the ankles, weakness of toe extension, or trouble walking on heels. Progression may lead to weakness, the involvement of fingertips, balance issues resulting in falls and fractures, risk of ulcerations and amputations.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Lower extremity amputations are associated with early postoperative mortality of up to 22%.

Negative Emotions of Oncology Nurses at Work

When caring for patients with CIPN, oncology nurses experienced mixed emotions.

① Indifference: respondents who had worked for more than 10 years considered CIPN to be an adverse reaction and did not need to pay much attention to it.

I don't feel anything, their numbness is mild and does not affect their daily life, I think it is a normal drug reaction and will naturally get better without medication.

② Sympathy: When patients report symptoms to caregivers, caregivers who have worked for a shorter period of time are more likely to feel sympathy.

I feel sorry for them and worry about them. If I can fix it I will help.

Many lung cancer patients would self-report numbness in their fingers and toes after several times of chemotherapy, and we understand very well that this is a side effect of chemotherapy drugs, and psychologically we sympathize with them very much, and also instruct to wear gloves and pay attention to keep warm, etc. but there is no better way to help them solve the numbness problem.

③ Guilt: Interviewees reported being unable to cope with CIPN episodes and were filled with guilt.

I am also ashamed of the fact that they are usually asked to consult their doctors on how to deal with it, but what can I do?

④ Lack of sense of value: two nurses in this study reported starting to question their professional value.

Over time, patients and families say that nurses don't know this and go straight to the doctor. I was sad to hear that and kind of regret choosing this career.

As the same health care worker, I sometimes doubt my own ability is not as good as doctors.

### Peripheral neuropathy: a review [^116ZaC5W]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Peripheral neuropathy, defined as damage to peripheral nerves, affects approximately 1% of adults worldwide. More than 200 causes of peripheral neuropathy exist, with symptoms ranging in severity from mild toe numbness to debilitating symptoms that can require a wheelchair. Diabetes is the most common cause of neuropathy, affecting approximately 206 million people worldwide.

Observations

Peripheral neuropathy is typically length-dependent, which means that symptoms appear in the longest nerve axons (toes) and progress proximally over time. Peripheral neuropathy is typically symmetric and affects sensory axons more than motor axons. Diabetic neuropathy, which is often associated with both sensory symptoms, such as pain, tingling, or numbness; mild weakness; and autonomic symptoms, such as orthostatic hypotension, accounts for more than 50% of peripheral neuropathy in Western populations. Other causes of neuropathy include hereditary causes, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, toxic neuropathy from medications (chemotherapies [eg, cisplatin, paclitaxel, vincristine], amiodarone, or HIV nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors [eg, stavudine, zalcitabine]); alcohol; vitamin deficiencies such as vitamin B12; and monoclonal gammopathies. Up to 27% of adults with neuropathy have no identifiable etiology for their neuropathy after diagnostic testing. Recommended initial testing includes blood glucose (for diabetes), serum B12 with metabolites (methylmalonic acid with or without homocysteine), and serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation (for monoclonal gammopathies). First-line medications for neuropathic pain are the α2-δ calcium channel subunit ligands, such as gabapentin and pregabalin; serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, such as duloxetine and venlafaxine; and tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitryptyline and nortriptyline. Pain often persists despite medical management. At least a 50% reduction in pain was observed in 38% of those with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy receiving 1200 mg of gabapentin daily. Combination drug therapies for neuropathic pain may provide added benefit. The prognosis of peripheral neuropathy depends on its underlying cause, but complete reversal of nerve damage is uncommon even in cases for which there are available treatments.

Conclusions and Relevance

Peripheral neuropathy affects approximately 1% of adults worldwide and may cause sensory, motor, and autonomic symptoms. Diabetes is the most common cause of peripheral neuropathy in Western countries. First-line therapies for neuropathic pain include gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine, and amitriptyline.

### Diabetic neuropathies: update on definitions, diagnostic criteria, estimation of severity, and treatments [^1116AxZp]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Definitions of minimal criteria for typical DPN

1. Possible DSPN.

The presence of symptoms or signs of DSPN may include the following: symptoms–decreased sensation, positive neuropathic sensory symptoms (e.g. "asleep numbness", prickling or stabbing, burning or aching pain) predominantly in the toes, feet, or legs; or signs–symmetric decrease of distal sensation or unequivocally decreased or absent ankle reflexes.

2. Probable DSPN.

The presence of a combination of symptoms and signs of neuropathy include any two or more of the following: neuropathic symptoms, decreased distal sensation, or unequivocally decreased or absent ankle reflexes.

3. Confirmed DSPN.

The presence of an abnormality of NC and a symptom or symptoms or a sign or signs of neuropathy confirm DSPN. If NC is normal, a validated measure of small fiber neuropathy (SFN) (with class 1 evidence) may be used.

To assess for the severity of DSPN, several approaches can be recommended: the graded approach outlined above, various continuous measures of sum scores of neurologic signs, symptoms or nerve test scores, scores of function of acts of daily living or of predetermined tasks or of disability. Irrespective of which approach is used, it is necessary to ensure good performance of evaluations with monitoring proficiency.

4. Subclinical DSPN.

The presence of no signs or symptoms of neuropathy are confirmed with abnormal NCs or a validated measure of SFN (with class 1 evidence).

We recommend that definitions 1, 2, or 3 be used for clinical practice and definitions 3 or 4 be used for research studies.

Atypical DPNs

Before further classification of these polyneuropathies, setting the minimal criteria for diagnosis and estimating severity and further characterizing of epidemiologic and mechanistic studies are needed. The issue of painful, autonomic, and nerve morphologic abnormalities are discussed in subsequent sections.

### "COVID toes" in three siblings [^111ZyRUh]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Dermatologists reported an outbreak of pernio (red to purple swollen painful toes) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most subjects lacked positive CoV-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antibodies or a preceding illness. The dermatologists termed the illness "COVID toes". Pernio usually affects adults versus "COVID toes" usually children. Pernio is preceded by a clear history of exposure to wet and cold. Patients with "COVID toes" lack this history. Also, it is not unusual for multiple family members to have "COVID toes". Our case report describes "COVID toes" in an 18-year-old with no preceding illness, a negative SARS-CoV-19 PCR, and an initially negative SARS-CoV-19 antibody, and also his 2 siblings also developed "COVID toes". In our index case, repeat SARS-CoV-19 antibodies were positive. Seroconversion has rarely been reported in patients with "COVID toes". Why most "COVID toes" patients lack a clinical history of COVID-19 and are SARS-CoV-19 PCR and antibody negative is a mystery.

### Foot care education in patients with diabetes at low risk of complications: a consensus statement [^1116L15e]. Diabetic Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Checking their own feet

Many patients may not understand the value of checking their feet on a daily basis. Demonstrations and visualizations of foot complications and self-care practices may therefore help to engage and empower patients and reinforce that early detection of problems or changes by themselves is key to preventing serious complications.

When considering what patients should be looking for when they check their feet, the panel agreed that changes in colour of or breaks in the skin, swelling, pain or numbness are the key features.

Reporting changes in their feet

Perhaps just as importantly as checking their feet, patients also need to be aware that, if they find changes in the colour of the skin, skin breaks, skin swelling, or if they feel pain or numbness in their feet, they should alert their general practitioner or other healthcare professional promptly.

### Painful and non-painful chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy and quality of life in colorectal cancer survivors: results from the population-based PROFILES registry [^1167vYWA]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy

The sensory scale of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of life Questionnaire Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy 20 (EORTC QLQ-CIPN20) was used to assess chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. Respondents are asked to indicate how often they had experienced the specific symptom in the past week. Items are answered on a four-point Likert scale ranging from (1) not at all to (4) very much. In the previous PROFILES study using the same sample as the current study, we found that survivors treated with chemotherapy only reported more shooting/burning pain, numbness, and tingling compared to survivors not treated with chemotherapy. On all other EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 items, there were no differences between the two groups. Therefore, we will only focus on these three symptoms, as we are specifically interested in peripheral neuropathy caused by chemotherapy. Painful CIPN was assessed using the items on shooting or burning pain in the (1) fingers or hands and (2) toes or feet. If survivors answered at least one of the items with "quite a bit" or "very much", painful CIPN was considered to be present. The items on (1) tingling fingers or hands, (2) tingling toes or feet, (3) numbness in fingers or hands, and (4) numbness in toes or feet were grouped together as an assessment of non-painful CIPN and considered to be present if survivors answered at least one of these items with "quite a bit" or "very much". Finally, survivors who did not report painful or non-painful CIPN were considered to have "no sensory CIPN".

Health-related quality of life

The EORTC-QLQ-C30 (version 3.0) was used to assess HRQoL. In this study, only the five functioning scales (i.e. physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social functioning) and the global health status/quality of life scale were used. Items are scored on a four-point Likert scale, which ranges from (1) not at all to (4) very much, except for the global quality of life scale, which ranges from (1) very poor to (7) excellent. Scores were linearly transformed to a 0–100 scale, with higher scores indicating a better functioning and better quality of life.

Frostbite background — frostbite is a condition that results from the freezing of skin and, in severe cases, underlying tissues, in which the formation of ice crystals within the cells causes cellular and tissue damage. The extremities — fingers, toes, nose, and ears — are particularly susceptible to frostbite, and the severity ranges from superficial frostbite affecting only the outer layers of the skin to more severe cases involving deeper tissues. Symptoms include numbness, tingling, pain, and changes in skin color, and in extreme cases frostbite can cause tissue necrosis leading to digit or limb loss.

### Vigabatrin (VIgAFYDE) [^1162jbEe]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.8 Peripheral Neuropathy

VIGAFYDE is indicated for treatment in patients 1 month to 2 years of age [see Indications and Usage (1)]. VIGAFYDE is not approved for use in adults. Vigabatrin causes symptoms of peripheral neuropathy in adults. Pediatric clinical trials were not designed to assess symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, but observed incidence of symptoms based on pooled data from controlled pediatric studies appeared similar for pediatric patients on vigabatrin and placebo. In a pool of North American controlled and uncontrolled epilepsy studies, 4.2% (19/457) of vigabatrin patients developed signs and/or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. In the subset of North American placebo-controlled epilepsy trials, 1.4% (4/280) of vigabatrin treated patients and no (0/188) placebo patients developed signs and/or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. Initial manifestations of peripheral neuropathy in these trials included, in some combination, symptoms of numbness or tingling in the toes or feet, signs of reduced distal lower limb vibration or position sensation, or progressive loss of reflexes, starting at the ankles. Clinical studies in the development program were not designed to investigate peripheral neuropathy systematically and did not include nerve conduction studies, quantitative sensory testing, or skin or nerve biopsy. There is insufficient evidence to determine if development of these signs and symptoms was related to duration of vigabatrin treatment, cumulative dose, or if the findings of peripheral neuropathy were completely reversible upon discontinuation of vigabatrin.

5.9 Weight Gain

VIGAFYDE causes weight gain in pediatric patients.

Data pooled from randomized controlled trials in pediatric patients with a different indication found that 47% (77/163) of vigabatrin patients versus 19% (19/102) of placebo patients gained ≥ 7% of baseline body weight.

In all epilepsy trials, 0.6% (31/4,855) of VIGAFYDE patients discontinued for weight gain. The long-term effects of vigabatrin related weight gain are not known. Weight gain was not related to the occurrence of edema.

### Buerger's disease in a 19-year-old woman [^113Krxta]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

A 19-year-old female college student had numbness and the sensation of coldness of her left toes. She had a 3-year smoking history. Gangrene of the left foot developed rapidly. Angiography revealed peripheral arterial occlusion of both legs and arms. Detailed laboratory examination excluded collagen disease, a hypercoagulable state, and juvenile atherosclerosis. Below-knee amputation of the left leg was performed. Typical histologic findings of Buerger's disease were observed in the crural arteries and saphenous veins. The clinical course was uneventful after the patient stopped smoking. This is the second case report of Buerger's disease in a woman in the second decade of life. It is important that a correct diagnosis of Buerger's disease be established, because the disease process is benign, compared with collagen disease, if the patient stops smoking.

### Operative versus non-operative treatment in diabetic dry toe gangrene [^115xkvCU]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Aim

Diabetic foot is a major comorbidity of diabetes, with 15–25% of diabetic patients developing diabetic foot ulcer during their lifetime. Other major diabetic foot complications include cellulitis, abscess, wet gangrene, dry gangrene, and necrotizing fasciitis. Dry gangrene involves tissue necrosis due to chronic ischemia whereby the tissue becomes numb, dry, wrinkled, and dead. Although diabetic foot complications have been extensively studied in literature, there is limited data on the management of dry gangrene.

Methods

We report a case series of 12 patients with diabetes-related dry gangrene in the toes, initially planned to be managed conservatively with autoamputation.

Results

One patient had an autoamputation, while eight patients underwent surgical amputations (six major amputations, two minor amputations) for better clinical outcomes. Two patients died, while no change was observed in one patient even after 12 months of follow-up.

Conclusion

Managing diabetic dry toe gangrene by waiting for autoamputation may lead to worse clinical outcomes and should be practiced cautiously on a case-by-case basis. Early surgical intervention should be opted to improve patients' quality of life.

### Painful legs and moving toes syndrome: a 76-patient case series… [^112tDiZn]. JAMA Network (2012). Excellent credibility.

The most frequently diagnosed causes were peripheral neuropathy, previous trauma, and radiculopathy; 32 cases were cryptogenic. Electromyography consistently showed irregular 50-millisecond to 1-second bursts of normal motor unit potential firing at 2 to 200 Hz accompanying the movements. Conclusions Painful legs and moving toes syndrome is a debilitating clinical syndrome, not because of the movements but rather because of the pain, which often is refractory to treatment. Segmental lower limb involvement is most common, and neurophysiologic findings support a pathophysiologic process localizing to a central generator at the spinal cord or brainstem level. Peripheral neuropathy accounted for the most common identifiable cause of the pain, of which approximately one-third were small-fiber neuropathy followed by limb trauma and radiculopathy.

Approximately half the cases had an identifiable neurogenic cause of pain. The clinical picture in these patients, as well as in previous reports, 11–14 suggests a potential origin in the peripheral nervous system, that is, a neurogenic origin. Peripheral injury to provoke movement disorders is controversial but has been previously described in hemifacial spasm, 15 "jumpy stump" syndrome after limb amputation, 16 belly dancers' dyskinesias, 17 and complex regional pain syndrome with dystonia. 18, 19 We note that the most commonly identified causes were peripheral neuropathy or antecedent trauma in our cases, with a temporal relationship to PLMT, and the subjective description of the pain was often characterized by neurogenic terms. This raises suspicion as a potential mechanism. In this series as well, the condition in some patients was triggered by musculoskeletal injury or was cryptogenic.

However, the evolution of the disorder suggests central nervous system integration to perpetuate the pain and mediate the moving digits. Several lines of evidence support this. Although the initial disorder started in one limb, it eventually became bilateral and segmental in most cases. In 2 cases, PLMT involved only the limb on the opposite side of the lesion.

### Definition of meningococcal disease-NCI dictionary… [^1123We9f]. NCI (2011). Low credibility.

meningococcal disease A serious disease caused by infection with bacteria called. Neisseria meningitidis. The bacteria can invade the blood, the thin layers of tissue that cover and protect the brain and spinal cord called the meninges, and rarely, the lungs. Meningococcal disease can be passed from one person to another through close contact with saliva, mucus, or other fluids from the nose, throat, or mouth. The signs and symptoms usually get worse very quickly. They include fever, headache, stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, confusion, sensitivity to light, a dark purple rash, fatigue, cold hands and feet, severe muscle or joint pain, rapid breathing, and diarrhea. Meningococcal disease is a life-threatening condition that can cause long-term problems, including brain or kidney damage, nervous system problems, hearing loss, and loss of arms, legs, fingers, or toes. It is more common in infants, teens, and young adults.

Other people who are at increased risk of the disease include those with a weakened immune system, those who take certain medicines, college students who live in dorms, and those who travel to, work, or live in areas where the disease is more common.

When the disease is well established in the lower limbs in more severe cases, there is upper limb involvement, with a similar progression proximally starting in the fingers. As the disease advances further, motor manifestations, such as wasting of the small muscles of the hands and limb weakness, become apparent. In some cases, there may be sensory loss that the patient may not be aware of, and the first presentation may be a foot ulcer. Approximately 50% of patients with DSPN experience neuropathic symptoms in the lower limbs including uncomfortable tingling (dysesthesia), pain (burning; shooting or "electric-shock like"; lancinating or "knife-like"; "crawling", or aching etc. in character), evoked pain (allodynia, hyperesthesia), or unusual sensations (such as a feeling of swelling of the feet or severe coldness of the legs when clearly the lower limbs look and feel fine, odd sensations on walking likened to "walking on pebbles" or "walking on hot sand", etc.). There may be marked pain on walking that may limit exercise and lead to weight gain. Painful DSPN is characteristically more severe at night and often interferes with normal sleep. It also has a major impact on the ability to function normally (both mental and physical functioning, e.g. ability to maintain work, mood, and quality of life [QoL]).

In one study from the U.S. the burden of painful DSPN was found to be considerable, resulting in a persistent discomfort despite polypharmacy and high resource use and led to limitations in daily activities and poor satisfaction with treatments. The unremitting nature of the pain can be distressing, resulting in mood disorders including depression and anxiety. The natural history of painful DSPN has not been well studied, and there is a need for large, population-based, prospective studies looking at the natural history and potentially modifiable risk factors, if any. However, it is generally believed that painful symptoms may persist over the years, occasionally becoming less prominent as the sensory loss worsens.

### The course of neuropathic symptoms in relation to adjuvant chemotherapy among elderly patients with stage III colon cancer: a Longitudinal study [^112ULfMA]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Among the elderly, the impairment of functional capacities due to neuropathy can have a significant impact. The aim of the present study was to investigate the course of neuropathic symptoms among elderly patients with stage III colon cancer treated with CAPOX (capecitabine, oxaliplatin), capecitabine monotherapy, or no adjuvant chemotherapy.

Materials and Methods

The Netherlands Cancer Registry was used to select patients with stage III colon cancer and aged ≥ 70 years. Questionnaires were sent after resection (T1) and 6 (T2) and 12 months (T3) later. Neuropathy was measured using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy 20. Logistic generalized estimating equations analyses were used to evaluate the effect of chemotherapy on the course of neuropathic symptoms.

Results

Of 155 eligible patients, 117 (76%) completed the T1 questionnaire, and 69 and 59 completed the T2 and T3 questionnaires, respectively. The course of the sensory symptoms tingling fingers or hands, tingling toes or feet, numbness in fingers or hands, and numbness in toes or feet was significantly unfavorable for patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy (CAPOX or capecitabine) compared with that for patients who had not received adjuvant chemotherapy. The course of numbness in toes or feet also differed significantly between patients treated with CAPOX (T1, 7%; T2, 50%; T3, 42%) and patients treated with capecitabine (T1, 17%; T2, 31%; T3, 8%). Additionally, patients treated with capecitabine reported significantly less tingling toes or feet (T1, 6%; T2, 25%; T3, 7%) compared with patients treated with CAPOX (T1, 0%; T2, 50%; T3, 58%).

Conclusion

The course of several sensory symptoms over time was less favorable for elderly patients with colon cancer treated with chemotherapy. Moreover, CAPOX was associated with more symptoms in toes and feet compared with capecitabine. It is important to inform patients of these risks to enable informed decision-making.

### Truncal pruritus of unknown origin may be a symptom of diabetic polyneuropathy [^113WTCNV]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

The study comprised two investigations. The first investigation consisted of a questionnaire to assess the prevalence of pruritus and its relevance to neuropathic symptoms and signs. The second investigation was performed using quantitative neurological function tests to determine what kind of nerve dysfunction is related to pruritus.

Prevalence of pruritus and its relevance to symptoms and signs of DPN

A large-scale survey of diabetic subjects was performed with the cooperation of the physicians of the Wakayama medical association. Between November 2006 and August 2007, questionnaires were sent to 48 medical practitioners and hospital physicians in Wakayama Prefecture, Japan. The questionnaires consisted of patient- and physician-completed portions, and both were returned to our department for analysis. A survey of nondiabetic subjects was performed with the cooperation of the health examination division of Wakayama Rosai Hospital. Between September 2006 and August 2007, the same questionnaires were used for nondiabetic subjects who had received annual medical examinations at their workplace. Participation was voluntary, and data that could identify individuals was not collected.

Items in questionnaire

Age (expressed as decade), sex, height, and body weight were obtained from all participants. Duration of diabetes, most recent A1C measurement, and Achilles tendon reflex (ATR) were provided by the physicians treating the diabetic participants. Subjective sensory symptoms were examined in diabetic and nondiabetic participants using four criteria: "numbness in toes and soles", "dysesthesia in toes and soles", "pain in feet", and "painful leg cramp". In this study, "numbness" was defined as an abnormal sensation with the absence of stimulation, and "dysesthesia" was defined as an abnormal sensation produced by ordinary stimuli. Final questions to diabetic and nondiabetic subjects concerned "pruritus" and its distribution in the body and the suspected cause of itching. Prevalence of pruritus and abnormal sensations were compared between diabetic and nondiabetic participants. The relations between pruritus and neurological symptoms, signs, and other clinical factors described above were also evaluated in diabetic participants.

### Quantitative sensory testing: report of the therapeutics and technology assessment subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^113faqZ2]. Neurology (2003). Medium credibility.

Quantitative sensory testing (QST) — chemotherapy-induced neuropathy in cancer patients: In a Class II study of 21 cancer patients treated with taxol and cisplatin, twenty of 21 developed at least one abnormal clinical finding, with loss of ankle reflexes in 90% and paresthesias or numbness in the feet in 76% within 7 days of treatment. Following treatment, QST vibratory thresholds rose above baseline in 17 patients (81%) at the great toe and in 11 patients (52%) at the index finger, and QST changes correlated with cumulative taxol dose at the great toe (r = 0.68) and index finger (r = 0.62). Based on limited Class II evidence, QST is possibly useful in demonstrating sensory abnormalities that result from chemotherapy-induced neuropathy (Level C recommendation).

### Vigabatrin (Vigpoder) [^114r1nNr]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.9 Peripheral Neuropathy

Vigabatrin causes symptoms of peripheral neuropathy in adults. Pediatric clinical trials were not designed to assess symptoms of peripheral neuropathy but observed incidence of symptoms based on pooled data from controlled pediatric studies appeared similar for pediatric patients on vigabatrin and placebo. In a pool of North American controlled and uncontrolled epilepsy studies, 4.2% (19/457) of vigabatrin patients developed signs and/or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. In the subset of North American placebo-controlled epilepsy trials, 1.4% (4/280) of vigabatrin treated patients and no (0/188) placebo patients developed signs and/or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. Initial manifestations of peripheral neuropathy in these trials included, in some combination, symptoms of numbness or tingling in the toes or feet, signs of reduced distal lower limb vibration or position sensation, or progressive loss of reflexes, starting at the ankles. Clinical studies in the development program were not designed to investigate peripheral neuropathy systematically and did not include nerve conduction studies, quantitative sensory testing, or skin or nerve biopsy. There is insufficient evidence to determine if development of these signs and symptoms was related to duration of vigabatrin treatment, cumulative dose, or if the findings of peripheral neuropathy were completely reversible upon discontinuation of vigabatrin.

5.10 Weight Gain

VIGPODER causes weight gain in adult and pediatric patients.

Data pooled from randomized controlled trials in adults found that 17% (77/443) of vigabatrin patients versus 8% (22/275) of placebo patients gained ≥ 7% of baseline body weight. In these same trials, the mean weight change among vigabatrin patients was 3.5 kg compared to 1.6 kg for placebo patients.

Data pooled from randomized controlled trials in pediatric patients with refractory complex partial seizures found that 47% (77/163) of vigabatrin patients versus 19% (19/102) of placebo patients gained ≥ 7% of baseline body weight.

In all epilepsy trials, 0.6% (31/4,855) of vigabatrin patients discontinued for weight gain. The long-term effects of vigabatrin related weight gain are not known. Weight gain was not related to the occurrence of edema.

### Going toe-to-toe with a rare case of a complex regional pain syndrome limited to the hallux [^1123taXS]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Outcome and follow-up

The patient was seen three times with the presence of a family member and an interpreter to ensure better communication with the medical staff. In the last consultation, in December 2020, the patient still described most of the CRPS symptoms. However, his reported pain decreased to 3/10, representing a halving of the initial stage. NSAIDs were only taken occasionally. Walking improved with a duration estimated to be 30–60' depending on the day, but always with difficulties with the late toe-off phase. The patient said he was gradually returning to a normal daily life. Although he reported the persistence of most of the initial symptoms, the disappearance of vasomotor signs and oedema/sudation has been confirmed, but not for moderate sensory and light motor signs. The persistence of the latter (discrete weakness and slightly reduced toe mobility) can be also interpreted as a manifestation of well-documented kinesiophobia and fear of pain.

### Chemotherapy-induced neuropathy and its association with quality of life among 2-to 11-year colorectal cancer survivors: results from the population-based PROFILES registry [^115oCpAG]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To gain insight into the prevalence and severity of chemotherapy-induced neuropathy and its influence on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in a population-based sample of colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors 2 to 11 years after diagnosis.

Methods

All alive individuals diagnosed with CRC between 2000 and 2009 as registered by the Dutch population-based Eindhoven Cancer Registry were eligible for participation. Eighty-three percent (n = 1,643) of patients filled out the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) C30 and the EORTC QLQ Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy 20.

Results

The five neuropathy subscale-related symptoms that bothered patients with CRC the most during the past week were erectile problems (42% of men), trouble hearing (11%), trouble opening jars or bottles (11%), tingling toes/feet (10%), and trouble walking stairs or standing up (9%). Additionally, patients who received oxaliplatin more often reported tingling (29% v 8%; P = 0.001), numbness (17% v 5%; P = 0.005), and aching or burning pain (13% v 6%; P = 0.03) in toes/feet compared with those not treated with chemotherapy. They also more often reported tingling toes/feet (29% v 14%; P = 0.0127) compared with those treated with chemotherapy without oxaliplatin. Those with many neuropathy symptoms (eg, upper 10%) reported statistically significant and clinically relevant worse HRQOL scores on all EORTC QLQ-C30 subscales (all P < .01).

Conclusion

Two to 11 years after diagnosis of CRC, neuropathy-related symptoms are still reported, especially sensory symptoms in the lower extremities among those treated with oxaliplatin. Because neuropathy symptoms have a negative influence on HRQOL, these should be screened for and alleviated. Future studies should focus on prevention and relief of chemotherapy-induced neuropathy.

### Treatments for Morton's neuroma [^1145ouhX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Morton's neuroma (MN) is a painful neuropathy resulting from a benign enlargement of the common plantar digital nerve that occurs commonly in the third webspace and, less often, in the second webspace of the foot. Symptoms include burning or shooting pain in the webspace that extends to the toes, or the sensation of walking on a pebble. These impact on weight-bearing activities and quality of life.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of interventions for MN.

Search Methods

On 11 July 2022, we searched CENTRAL, CINAHL Plus EBSCOhost, ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, Embase Ovid, MEDLINE Ovid, and WHO ICTRP. We checked the bibliographies of identified randomised trials and systematic reviews and contacted trial authors as needed.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised, parallel-group trials (RCTs) of any intervention compared with placebo, control, or another intervention for MN. We included trials where allocation occurred at the level of the individual or the foot (clustered data). We included trials that confirmed MN through symptoms, a clinical test, and an ultrasound scan (USS) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We assessed bias using Cochrane's risk of bias 2 tool (RoB 2) and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE framework.

Main Results

We included six RCTs involving 373 participants with MN. We judged risk of bias as having 'some concerns' across most outcomes. No studies had a low risk of bias across all domains. Post-intervention time points reported were: three months to less than 12 months from baseline (nonsurgical outcomes), and 12 months or longer from baseline (surgical outcomes). The primary outcome was pain, and secondary outcomes were function, satisfaction or health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and adverse events (AE). Nonsurgical treatments Corticosteroid and local anaesthetic injection (CS+LA) versus local anaesthetic injection (LA) Two RCTs compared CS+LA versus LA. At three to six months:

- CS+LA may result in little to no difference in pain (mean difference (MD) -6.31 mm, 95% confidence interval (CI) -14.23 to 1.61; P = 0.12, I² = 0%; 2 studies, 157 participants; low-certainty evidence). (Assessed via a pain visual analogue scale (VAS; 0 to 100 mm); a lower score indicated less pain.)
- CS+LA may result in little to no difference in function when compared with LA (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.30, 95% CI -0.61 to 0.02; P = 0.06, I² = 0%; 2 studies, 157 participants; low-certainty evidence). (Function was measured using: the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Lesser Toe Metatarsophalangeal-lnterphalangeal Scale (AOFAS; 0 to 100 points) - we transformed the scale so that a lower score indicated improved function - and the Manchester Foot Pain and Disability Schedule (MFPDS; 0 to 100 points), where a lower score indicated improved function.)
- CS+LA probably results in little to no difference in HRQoL when compared to LA (MD 0.07, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.17; P = 0.19; 1 study, 122 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and CS+LA may not increase satisfaction (risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.85; P = 0.78; 1 study, 35 participants; low-certainty evidence). (Assessed using the EuroQol five dimension instrument (EQ-5D; 0–1 point); a higher score indicated improved HRQoL.)
- The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of CS+LA on AE when compared with LA (RR 9.84, 95% CI 1.28 to 75.56; P = 0.03, I² = 0%; 2 studies, 157 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Adverse events for CS+LA included mild skin atrophy (3.9%), hypopigmentation of the skin (3.9%) and plantar fat pad atrophy (2.6%); no adverse events were observed with LA. Ultrasound-guided (UG) CS+LA versus non-ultrasound-guided (NUG) CS+LA Two RCTs compared UG CS+LA versus NUG CS+LA. At six months:

- UG CS+LA probably reduces pain when compared with NUG CS+LA (MD -15.01 mm, 95% CI -27.88 to -2.14; P = 0.02, I² = 0%; 2 studies, 116 feet; moderate-certainty evidence). (Assessed with a pain VAS.)
- UG CS+LA probably increases function when compared with NUG CS+LA (SMD -0.47, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.10; P = 0.01, I² = 0%; 2 studies, 116 feet; moderate-certainty evidence). We do not know of any established minimum clinical important difference (MCID) for the scales that assessed function, specifically, the MFPDS and the Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire (MOXFQ; 0 to 100 points; a lower score indicated improved function.)
- UG CS+LA may increase satisfaction compared with NUG CS+LA (risk ratio (RR) 1.71, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.44; P = 0.003, I² = 15%; 2 studies, 114 feet; low-certainty evidence).
- HRQoL was not measured.
- UG CS+LA may result in little to no difference in AE when compared with NUG CS+LA (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.39; P = 0.15, I² = 0%; 2 studies, 116 feet; low-certainty evidence). AE included depigmentation or fat atrophy for UG CS+LA (4.9%) and NUG CS+LA (12.7%). Surgical treatments Plantar incision neurectomy (PN) versus dorsal incision neurectomy (DN) One study compared PN versus DN. At 34 months (mean; range 28 to 42 months), PN may result in little to no difference for satisfaction (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.28; P = 0.58; 1 study, 73 participants; low-certainty evidence), or for AE (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.32 to 2.85; P = 0.93; 1 study, 75 participants; low-certainty evidence) compared with DN. AE for PN included hypertrophic scaring (11.4%), foreign body reaction (2.9%); AE for DN included missed nerve (2.5%), artery resected (2.5%), wound infection (2.5%), postoperative dehiscence (2.5%), deep vein thrombosis (2.5%) and reoperation with plantar incision due to intolerable pain (5%). The data reported for pain and function were not suitable for analysis. HRQoL was not measured.

Authors' Conclusions

Although there are many interventions for MN, few have been assessed in RCTs. There is low-certainty evidence that CS+LA may result in little to no difference in pain or function, and moderate-certainty evidence that UG CS+LA probably reduces pain and increases function for people with MN. Future trials should improve methodology to increase certainty of the evidence, and use optimal sample sizes to decrease imprecision.

What are the possible side effects of epinephrine injection?

Epinephrine injection may cause serious side effects.

Epinephrine injection should only be injected into the middle of your outer thigh (upper leg). Do not inject epinephrine injection into your:
veins
buttocks
fingers, toes, hands or feet.

If you accidentally inject epinephrine injection into any other part of your body, go to the nearest emergency room right away. Tell the healthcare provider where on your body you received the accidental injection.

redness that does not go away
swelling
tenderness
the area feels warm to the touch
Cuts on the skin, bent needles, and needles that remain in the skin after the injection, have happened in young children who do not cooperate and kick or move during an injection. If you inject a young child with epinephrine injection, hold their leg firmly in place before and during the injection to prevent injuries. Ask your healthcare provider to show you how to properly hold the leg of a young child during an injection.
If you have certain medical conditions, or take certain medicines, your condition may get worse or you may have more or longer lasting side effects when you use epinephrine injection. Talk to your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions.

Common side effects of epinephrine injection include:

faster, irregular or "pounding" heartbeat
sweating
headache
weakness
shakiness
paleness
feelings of over excitement, nervousness, or anxiety
dizziness

### Comparison of the accuracy of monofilament testing at various points of feet in peripheral diabetic neuropathy screening [^1123WRkw]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

*Minimum of 16 point 1 point reported by patients as a numbness site.

† Minimum of 16 point 2 point reported by patients as numbness site.

‡ Minimum of 16 point 8 point reported by patients as numbness site.

We also compared the results of monofilament with the improved sensitivity and specificity of the improved neuropathy criterion and the tuning fork tests (Table 6). Patients who acquired scores greater than, or equal to, 6 of the improved neuropathy criterion, were defined as patients with neuropathy symptoms. The sensitivity and specificity of these two criteria were obtained 91% and 94.9% respectively.

Table 6
Sensitivity and specificity according to methodologies used to assess insensitivity

a ≥ 1 of the two sites tested was considered positive.

Results of the improved neuropathy criterion showed that of the 150 patients with neuropathy participating in the study, 138 patients have acquired scores equal to or greater than 6, and it shows that according to this criterion, 92% of our patients had been moderate to severe symptoms of neuropathy.

Moreover, the tuning fork testing that is part of NDS criterion was evaluated separately. Thus, the lack of the tuning fork vibration sense on one of the big toes was used as a positive point. Sensitivity and specificity of tuning fork was alone at these points 84.6% and 43.2% respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of both tests were greater than monofilament.

### Case report of a patient with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy treated with manual therapy (massage) [^111F3u4U]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common, miserable, potentially severe, and often dose-limiting side effect of several first and second-line anti-cancer agents with little in the way of effective, acceptable treatment. Although mechanisms of damage differ, manual therapy (therapeutic massage) has effectively reduced symptoms and improved quality of life in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

Methods

Here, we describe application of manual therapy (techniques of effleurage and petrissage) to the extremities in a patient with grade 2 CIPN subsequent to prior treatment with docetaxel and cisplatin for stage III esophageal adenocarcinoma. Superficial cutaneous temperature was monitored using infrared thermistry as proxy for microvascular blood flow.

Results

By the end of the course of manual therapy without any change in medications, CIPN symptoms were greatly reduced to grade 1, with corresponding improvement in quality of life. Improvements in superficial temperature were observed in fingers and toes.

Conclusions

Manual therapy was associated with almost complete resolution of the tingling and numbness and pain of CIPN in this patient. Concurrently increased superficial temperature suggests improvements in CIPN symptoms may have involved changes in blood circulation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of using manual therapy for amelioration of CIPN.

### Vigabatrin (Sabril) [^116FiyPp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.9 Peripheral Neuropathy

SABRIL causes symptoms of peripheral neuropathy in adults. Pediatric clinical trials were not designed to assess symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, but observed incidence of symptoms based on pooled data from controlled pediatric studies appeared similar for pediatric patients on vigabatrin and placebo. In a pool of North American controlled and uncontrolled epilepsy studies, 4.2% (19/457) of SABRIL patients developed signs and/or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. In the subset of North American placebo-controlled epilepsy trials, 1.4% (4/280) of SABRIL treated patients and no (0/188) placebo patients developed signs and/or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. Initial manifestations of peripheral neuropathy in these trials included, in some combination, symptoms of numbness or tingling in the toes or feet, signs of reduced distal lower limb vibration or position sensation, or progressive loss of reflexes, starting at the ankles. Clinical studies in the development program were not designed to investigate peripheral neuropathy systematically and did not include nerve conduction studies, quantitative sensory testing, or skin or nerve biopsy. There is insufficient evidence to determine if development of these signs and symptoms was related to duration of SABRIL treatment, cumulative dose, or if the findings of peripheral neuropathy were completely reversible upon discontinuation of SABRIL.

5.10 Weight Gain

SABRIL causes weight gain in adult and pediatric patients.

Data pooled from randomized controlled trials in adults found that 17% (77/443) of SABRIL patients versus 8% (22/275) of placebo patients gained ≥ 7% of baseline body weight. In these same trials, the mean weight change among SABRIL patients was 3.5 kg compared to 1.6 kg for placebo patients.

Data pooled from randomized controlled trials in pediatric patients with refractory complex partial seizures found that 47% (77/163) of SABRIL patients versus 19% (19/102) of placebo patients gained ≥ 7% of baseline body weight.

In all epilepsy trials, 0.6% (31/4855) of SABRIL patients discontinued for weight gain. The long term effects of SABRIL related weight gain are not known. Weight gain was not related to the occurrence of edema.

### Pediatric COVID toes and fingers [^116LoFgm]. Clinics in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

The emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide pandemic has been associated with a new constellation of cutaneous features in children. Among the unusual dermatologic presentations are the so-called COVID toes, inflammatory nodules of the feet and toes, sometimes involving the hands and fingers. These lesions mimic acral pernio, the synonym being chilblains. Unlike adult patients with COVID toes, children are less likely to manifest symptomatic COVID-19. Although a few studies have found some linkage to COVID-19 through the serum IgA or IgG severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein, other studies have no demonstrable linkage suggesting that barefoot children in cold weather develop such lesions. It appears that the chilblain-like lesions related to the period of the COVID-19 pandemic may reflect a brisk immune response portending a good prognosis and perhaps some form of innate immunity. The possible need to screen for coagulopathy is unclear, but this has been suggested in one report. Until we fully understand the pattern of immune response to COVID-19, questions may persist as to how disease manifestations are linked to SARS-CoV-2 exposures.

Subjective symptoms of DPN at the time of secondary enrollment are defined as follows: (1) bilateral; (2) numbness, pain, or abnormal sensation in the toes or soles of the feet (however, abnormal sensation alone is not sufficient). The presence of upper limb symptoms alone is not considered a subjective symptom of DPN in the interventional study. Numbness, pain, and abnormal sensation in the toes and soles of the feet are determined based on the neuropathy questionnaire (see Supplementary methods).

Patients with severe pain due to causes other than DPNP in whom it is considered difficult to assess pain, and patients with creatinine clearance (CrCL) < 30 ml/min will be excluded from the interventional study.

### Evaluating the content validity of the modified neuropathy total symptom score-6 self-administered (mNTSS-6-SA) in a painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy population [^111sL434]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) results from nerve damage caused by type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). DPN is the most common form of distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSP), affecting the longest nerve fibers first, typically symmetrically starting in the toes, feet, and lower limb and then affecting the hands.DPN is often progressive and bothersome, resulting in clinical complications and impairments in functioning. DPN is frequently accompanied by pain (pDPN), affecting approximately 2.3 million Americans and 30% of the diabetes population globally. A variety of treatments have been used for pDPN and new treatments are being developed. Patients continue to call for increased awareness of the consequences of pDPN, highlighting the need for more focused research. Robust outcome measures are needed to assess and monitor symptoms of pDPN.

The Neuropathy Total Symptom Score-6 (NTSS-6) was developed as a 12-item, clinician-reported outcome (ClinRO) measure to evaluate sensory symptoms of neuropathy in individuals with DPN. The measure was developed based on a literature review and consultations with experts in neurology and peripheral neuropathyand has been translated into 40 different languages. The NTSS-6 evaluates the severity (items A) and frequency (items B) of six neuropathic sensory symptoms on a 4-point verbal response scale with a 24-hour recall period. Symptoms measured include, 1) numbness and/or insensitivity, 2) aching pain or tightness, 3) burning sensation, 4) prickling and/or tingling, 5) sharp, shooting, or lancinating pain, 6) allodynia and/or hyperalgesia. The measure produces scores of 0–21, where a higher score indicates more frequent/severe symptoms. A self-administered (NTSS-6-SA) version of the measure was also developed and its' psychometric properties evaluated among people with DM. The NTSS-6-SA includes the same 12-items and response options with a 4-week recall period. Both versions were found to provide a reliable assessment of treatment in neuropathic symptoms that shows evidence of validity in the DPN population. Several recent studies have used the NTSS-6or NTSS-6-SAto assess neuropathy in DM and other conditions. The NTSS-6 has also been used as a secondary endpoint in a randomized clinical trial for treatment of symptomatic DPN.

Among patients who reported SPN at 1-year follow-up, tingling fingers or hands (46%), tingling toes or feet (40%), numbness in toes or feet (38%), and numbness in fingers or hands (32%) were most frequently reported. In addition, while among 33% (n = 38) of patients SPN symptoms had returned to baseline at 2-year follow-up, 51% (n = 59) continued to have SPN levels above baseline (n = 18 missing). Specifically, SPN symptoms improved slightly compared to 1-year follow-up, but did not return to baseline in 28% (n = 32) of patients, remained stable in 11% (n = 13), and worsened in 12% (n = 14). Patients reported improvements primarily in tingling toes or feet (37%) and tingling fingers or hands (38%), and deterioration in problems standing or walking because of difficulty feeling the ground under their feet (12%) and numbness in toes or feet (11%).

Among patients with MPN at 1-year follow-up, difficulty opening a jar or bottle because of weakness in hands (62%), difficulty manipulating small objects with fingers (50%), difficulty climbing stairs or getting up out of a chair because of weakness in legs (42%), and cramps in hands (35%) were most frequently reported. At 2-year follow-up, MPN symptoms had returned to baseline in 33% (n = 44) of patients, whereas symptoms had not returned to baseline in 54% (n = 72, n = 18 missing). Specifically, during that year, symptoms had improved somewhat in 22% of patients, remained stable in 16%, and worsened in 16%. Improvements were mainly reported in difficulty opening a jar or bottle because of weakness in hands (25%) and difficulty manipulating small objects with fingers (22%), while deteriorations were mainly reported in cramps in feet (13%) and cramps in hands (10%).

### Axonal excitability does not differ between painful and painless diabetic or chemotherapy-induced distal symmetrical polyneuropathy in a multicenter observational study [^112ieoTC]. Annals of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Distal Symmetrical Polyneuropathy

Possible distal symmetrical polyneuropathy is defined as the presence of either sensory symptoms (ie, numbness, paresthesias, burning in the toes, feet, or legs) or sensory signs (ie, symmetric decrease of distal sensation or unequivocally decreased or absent ankle reflexes).

Probable distal symmetrical polyneuropathy includes any two or more of the following: sensory symptoms, decreased distal sensation, or unequivocally decreased or absent ankle reflexes.

Definite distal symmetrical polyneuropathy is defined as the presence of sensory symptoms or signs of neuropathy with an abnormality on a confirmatory test, which includes either nerve conduction studies or a validated measure of small fiber neuropathy (ie, abnormal thermal thresholds on quantitative sensory testing or reduced intraepidermal nerve fiber density).

Only participants who satisfied criteria for probable or definite distal symmetrical polyneuropathy underwent neuropathic pain grading.

Neuropathic Pain

The grading of the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group of the International Association for the Study of Pain was used to grade neuropathic pain. Possible neuropathic pain fulfils criteria 1 and 2. Probable neuropathic pain fulfils criteria 1, 2, and 3. Definite neuropathic pain fulfils all 4 criteria:
Pain with a distinct neuroanatomically plausible distribution — pain symmetrically distributed in the extremities.
A history suggestive of a relevant lesion or disease affecting the peripheral or central somatosensory system — diagnosis of diabetes mellitus or history of chemotherapy treatment with a history of neuropathy symptoms including decreased sensation or positive sensory symptoms in the toes, feet, or legs.
Demonstration of distinct neuroanatomically plausible distribution of neuropathic pain — presence of clinical signs of distal symmetrical polyneuropathy.
Demonstration of the relevant lesion or disease by at least one confirmatory test — abnormality on either the nerve conduction tests or intraepidermal nerve fiber density.

Only study participants who satisfied criteria for no neuropathic pain, and probable or definite neuropathic pain, proceeded to axonal excitability assessment and analysis.

### Midthoracic punctate midline myelotomy for treatment of chronic, intractable, nonmalignant, abdominal visceral pain: 2-dimensional operative video [^114uBWjN]. Operative Neurosurgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Punctate midline myelotomy (PMM) is a surgical procedure that damages the ascending fibers of the postsynaptic dorsal column (PSDC) pathway to interrupt visceral pain transmission.1–3 It can offer relief to patients with chronic visceral pain conditions that are refractory to other treatments. Here, we present a surgical video of midthoracic PMM in a patient with chronic, intractable, nonmalignant visceral abdominal pain that failed over a decade of medical treatment. We choose T7-8 as the level for laminectomy in patients with pelvic or lower abdominal pain, because the postsynaptic pain fibers transmitting visceral pain sensation from the lower abdominal organs will invariably be caudal to this level. The patient developed immediate and complete relief of her visceral pain after the procedure, which was sustained through the 11-wk follow-up period to date and was able to be weaned off narcotics. Postoperatively, she remained full strength and had no impairment of light touch or proprioception of her lower extremities. Detailed physical examination showed a reduced vibratory sensation on the glabrous skin of her great toes. Regarding patient-reported sensory changes (not detected on physical examination), she reported some numbness on the insides of her feet that had resolved by 11-wk follow-up. She also reported some numbness of the vulva, but not of the vagina. However, by 11-wk follow-up, she reported this had resolved and she had normal sexual function. The only persistent sensation at 11-wk follow-up was slight tingling in her toes that was not bothersome to her.4 The patient presented in the following video consented to both the surgical procedure and the publication of her clinical history and operative video.

In the electrodiagnostic (EDX) approach of the patient who presents with foot pain, numbness, and/or tingling, it is important to consider a broad differential diagnosis of both neuropathic and nonneuropathic conditions, including focal and systemic causes. This article assists the electromyographer in the selection and utilization of the most appropriate EDX studies for evaluation. The EDX findings and impression can then help guide potential treatment options for the patient with foot pain and other symptoms. Moreover, this discussion demonstrates the added value that EDX evaluation of the foot provides to the comprehensive assessment of foot pain.

D: Meissner corpuscle density of healthy subjects plotted on the age in years. There is a rapid decrease in density with development (as the surface area increases) and a further decline with aging. (The figure is redrawn from data in Bolton et al. A quantitative study of Meissner's corpuscles in man. Neurology 1966;16:1–9.)

Three main patterns of sensation loss mirror the fiber class vulnerability in peripheral nerve disease: selective involvement of large sensory fiber function of touch pressure and vibration (e.g. as found in pseudotabes diabetica and spinocerebellar degeneration); selective involvement of small sensory and often also of autonomic nerve fibers (atypical small-fiber DPN, transthyretin amyloid polyneuropathy, hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies, and Fabry and Tangier disease); and involvement of both large and small fibers (e.g. typical DSPN and many varieties of other distal symmetric sensorimotor polyneuropathies).

Overview of methods to assess decreased sensation.

Characterization of the kind, severity, and distribution of sensation loss is useful and needed for the diagnosis of varieties of polyneuropathies, judging their severity, and monitoring course. Rigorous assessment of sensation loss is especially needed for use in therapeutic trials and for following the clinical course of individual patients on specific therapies. The clinical approaches for doing this are assessment of sensory symptoms (i.e. negative neuropathic sensory symptoms); clinical examination using simple hand-held devices (cotton wool, stick pins, and tuning forks); recognition of joint motion; and object recognition and use of other similar approaches. Simple office or bedside QSTs may help in such bedside assessments.

Surrogate measurements of sensation loss include the following: assessment of attributes of NCs of sensory nerve fibers; morphometric counts of nerve endings (intraepidermal nerve fibers) or of nerve fibers of biopsied sural nerve; and specialized studies (e.g. nerve excitability studies [NES]).

### Prevalence and presentation of lower limb neurovascular complications in children with diabetes: a systematic review with proportion meta-analysis [^114s3cR6]. Pediatric Diabetes (2025). Medium credibility.

Only one of the 18 studies was a prospective cohort study design with an observation period of 5 years, where authors concluded a prevalence of 13.2% complications, which increased to 34.2%, a 2.6-fold increase. The authors assessed the neuropathy disability score (NDS) using the ankle reflex, vibration, pinprick, and temperature sensations at the great toe, where an NDS score of 3 or more was considered pathological. Following this, neurological symptoms were scored on neuropathy symptom score (NSS); the nature (burning, numbness, or tingling, fatigue, cramping, or aching), location of symptoms (feet, calves or elsewhere), if symptoms displayed during day and/or nighttime with an extra point if symptoms woke the patient up and relief of pain either/and from walking, standing and sitting/lying down. An NSS of 3 or more indicated diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN).

The majority of the studies used a cross-sectional design without age and sex-matched controls, which significantly reduces the ability to detect true pathology in a population of interest over a longer observational period. Furthermore, a wide range of variables, including the duration of diabetes, HbA1c levels, age, gender, BMI, height, weight, and pubertal stage, are shown to have an association in participants with diabetic neuropathy of which are reported inconsistently in each study.

4.2. Vasculopathy

There is a paucity of evidence assessing the presence of vascular complications such as peripheral arterial disease in children with diabetes mellitus. One reason may be due to a lack of clinical direction based on current guidelines. One study found that only 6% of general practitioners were aware of the evidence-based guidelines for screening of peripheral arterial disease, and only 5% with the diagnostic guidelines. The high prevalence of peripheral arterial disease using the ABI (37.7% vs. 6.7% in controls) in Akinyosoye et al. could arise due to a higher average value of the HbA1c report in their study. This review found no studies have explored the use of toe–brachial indexes to detect peripheral arterial disease in children with diabetes, which is required given the impact of diabetes on microvascular circulation. Current studies on children have only used ABIs, which have been shown to be less sensitive and specific in detecting peripheral arterial disease in adult people with diabetes.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome and glioblastoma [^114Bk3mD]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is defined as an acute demyelinating peripheral neuropathy. We describe a case of GBS in a patient with glioblastoma undergoing chemotherapy treatment. A 57 year old woman diagnosed with glioblastoma developed a subacute progressive history of bilateral symmetric numbness of her fingers and toes, belt-type neuropathic pain, a left facial droop and upper and lower extremity muscle weakness. There was no evidence of a tumor mass or leptomeningeal disease in the spine. Electrophysiological studies confirmed the diagnosis. Although rare, GBS should be considered in primary brain tumor patients with generalized acute-subacute progressive weakness that is inconsistent with the location of their tumor, particularly if they are also on chemotherapy contributing to their immunosuppressive state.

3.3 Symptom Localization

The localization data for burning pain, pins and needles, and numbness were available for the original cohort of 105 patients (Figure 3, Table S3). The three symptoms were not observed in the same location in individual patients, which was also reflected at the group level by different patterns of symptom distribution within clusters (Figure 3).

FIGURE 3
Localization of SFN symptoms of each cluster. Depicted is the percent of patients in the algesic (A), myalgic (B), and pauci‐symptomatic (C) clusters who marked the location of burning pain (first column), pins and needles (second column), and numbness (third column) on a stick figure. Note the proximal involvement of symptoms in all clusters, the stocking‐glove distribution of symptoms in the algesic cluster (A) and the relative proximal involvement of pins and needles and numbness in the pauci‐symptomatic cluster (C).

Most patients in all clusters reported symptoms in their feet. However, the involvement of more proximal sites differed between clusters (Figure 3; Table S3). Patients in the algesic cluster experienced symptoms in a stocking‐glove pattern with symptoms in feet reported by most patients, followed by symptoms in hands and then in more proximal sites (Figure 3A). Symptoms were more generalized in the other two clusters (Figure 3B, C). Although burning pain was most widely distributed in the algesic group, only feet and hands were significantly more frequently affected (Table S3), indicating that burning pain affects more proximal areas in the myalgic and pauci‐symptomatic clusters. Thus, symptoms in the algesic cluster followed a stocking‐glove pattern, whereas symptoms involved relatively more proximal sites in the myalgic and pauci‐symptomatic clusters (Figure 3).

3.4 Dysautonomia

Symptoms of dysautonomia were most commonly reported by patients in the algesic cluster, followed by patients in the myalgic and then the pauci‐symptomatic clusters (Figure S2). Bladder and bowel incontinence were significantly less frequently reported than the other autonomic symptoms in all clusters (Figure S2). Patients in the myalgic cluster reported more frequent GI dysmotility (constipation/diarrhea), dry eyes, and dry mouth than abnormal sweating (Figure S2B).

### Late-onset sensory-motor axonal neuropathy, a novel SLC12A6-related phenotype [^112cyerD]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

Family 2

Both father (Patient I-1) and daughter (Patient II-1) were only children. The daughter was diagnosed with axonal sensory and motor neuropathy at the age of 42. As long as she could remember, she had tended to stumble, but the problem had recently worsened. She also complained of numbness in her feet and legs in addition to slight unsteadiness. Aged 44, she stumbled and fractured her right ankle. On neurological examination at the age of 46 years she had a mild sensory ataxia, slightly reduced pain and touch sensation in her feet, mild to moderate reduction of vibration sense and proprioception distal in the feet in addition to hyporeflexia. During Romberg's test, she had to steady herself 5 s after closing her eyes. Brain CT scan was normal.

Her father was referred to a neurologist when he was almost 70 years old. At that time, he had become increasingly unsteady for the past 4 years. He reported no sensory symptoms. Clinically he had more distal motor deficits than his daughter (Table 1). He presented with mild muscle wasting in both feet and legs, moderate muscle weakness for toe and ankle plantar- and dorsiflexion, slightly reduced vibration sense in ankles and toes and slightly reduced proprioception in toes. He had hyporeflexia in the upper limbs and areflexia in the lower limbs. Romberg's test was positive. He was not able to walk in a straight line or walk on his toes or heels. Brain MRI revealed no abnormalities except moderate age-related changes.

In both, NCS showed a pronounced sensory axonal symmetrical polyneuropathy with no evocable sensory responses in arms and legs with a distal nearly symmetric axonal motor component, more severe in the father (Table 2). Needle EMG in the father showed a moderate chronic neurogenic pattern in the tibial anterior muscle and lateral vastus muscle with slight to moderate denervation, while in the daughter the neurogenic changes were milder.

### Truncal pruritus of unknown origin may be a symptom of diabetic polyneuropathy [^116Gm64Z]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Relevance of pruritus to signs and symptoms of DPN

The age of patients with TPUO and duration of DPN were significantly higher than those of patients without TPUO. The prevalence of all symptoms of DPN (numbness in toes and soles, dysesthesia in toes and soles, pain in feet, and painful leg cramps) and bilateral areflexia of ATR in the patients with TPUO was significantly higher than those in the patients without TPUO (Table 1). Thus, multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to confirm the risk factors for TPUO. Seven clinical factors were correlated into scores (age: < 60 years, 0, 60–69 years, 1, and ≥ 70 years, 2; sex: female, 0 and male, 1; duration of diabetes: < 5 years, 0, 5–9 years, 1, and ≥ 10 years, 2; BMI: < 22.0 kg/m², 0, 22.0–24.9 kg/m², 1, and ≥ 25.0 kg/m², 2; A1C: < 6.5%, 0, 6.5–7.9%, 1, and ≥ 8.0%, 2; dysesthesia: no, 0 and yes, 1; and absence of both ATR: no, 0 and yes,1) and adopted as independent valuables. As a result, numbness in toes and soles, ATR areflexia, and longer duration of diabetes were identified as the independent risk factors of TPUO (Fig. 1).

Figure 1
Multiple logistic regression analysis with TPUO as an independent variable revealed that dysesthesia, ATR areflexia, and duration were significant risk factors for TPUO with odds ratios of 1.649, 1.811, and 1.264, respectively. Horizontal columns show the 95% CIs of each independent factor.

### Diabetic foot [^113BZSED]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

What causes diabetic foot?

Uncontrolled diabetes contributes to the development of neuropathy and peripheral arterial disease by complex metabolic pathways. Loss of sensation caused by peripheral neuropathy, ischaemia due to peripheral arterial disease, or a combination of these may lead to foot ulcers. A systematic review (78 studies from 84 cohorts) reports a prevalence of 0.003–2.8% for diabetes related peripheral neuropathy and 0.01–0.4% for diabetes related peripheral arterial disease. Figure 1depicts factors that contribute to foot complications.

Fig 1 Risk factors and mechanism for foot ulcer and amputation

Diabetes is also implicated in Charcot arthropathy, which involves progressive destruction of the bones, joints, and soft tissues, most commonly in the ankle and foot. Diabetes related Charcot's arthropathy has a reported prevalence between 0.08% and 13%, but there are no high quality epidemiological studies on Charcot's foot. A combination of neuropathy, abnormal loading of foot, repeated micro trauma, and metabolic abnormalities of bone leads to inflammation, causing osteolysis, fractures, dislocation, and deformities.

In low and middle income countries barefoot walking, lack of awareness, delay in seeking care, and shortage of trained healthcare providers and foot care services are common factors that add to the burden of foot disease.

### Restless legs syndrome is frequently overlooked in patients being evaluated for polyneuropathies [^114xByri]. European Journal of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) often presents with paresthesias and dysesthesisas. We have investigated the prevalence and clinical features of RLS in a cohort of patients referred for clinical suspicion of peripheral neuropathy (PN). Sixty-four patients with sensory symptoms, and 101 age-matched controls were prospectively evaluated for RLS, PN and causes of both conditions. In the 64 patients (60 ± 14 years), none were referred with a suspicion of RLS. Forty-one had a sensori-motor PN of which 22 had a definite RLS (54%). When excluding other causes of RLS, 8 of 41 patients had a RLS associated with a neuropathy (20%). The proportion of RLS in the healthy controls was 10%, lower than in the cohort of patients. In patients without PN, 57% had a RLS, and 55% in the whole cohort, a higher proportion than in the healthy controls (P < 0.0001). Patients with PN and RLS had more sleep disorders (P < 0.04), and legs and calves symptoms (P = 0.09) than patients with PN without RLS. Toes symptoms were more frequently observed in patients with PN but without RLS (P < 0.02). We conclude that RLS frequently presents with symptoms suggestive of peripheral neuropathy, and therefore, is often overlooked.

### CLINICAL PRACTICE. diabetic sensory and motor neuropathy [^113XWcVG]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on diabetic neuropathy:

- **Definition**: Diabetic neuropathy is a type of neuropathy that occurs due to microvascular disease and chronic hyperglycemia in diabetic patients.
- **Pathophysiology**: Diabetic neuropathy is caused by persistent hyperglycemia, microvascular insufficiency, oxidative and nitrosative stress, defective neurotropism, and autoimmune-mediated nerve destruction in patients with diabetes mellitus.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of diabetic neuropathy is estimated at 17.8 per 100,000 person-years in the United Kingdom.
- **Disease course**: Nerve damage leads to hyperalgesia, dysesthesia, allodynia, weakness, numbness, hypoalgesia, anomalies in thermal sensation and autonomic function, foot ulcerations, gangrene, and amputations.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Diabetic neuropathy is associated with a 1.7-12-fold higher risk of amputation. In addition, autonomic neuropathy is associated with a mortality rate of approximately 25–50% at 5–10 years.

### Sensory, psychological, and metabolic dysfunction in HIV-associated peripheral neuropathy: a cross-sectional deep profiling study [^111UjMh9]. Pain (2014). Low credibility.

As originally described, the BPNS is not proscriptive on the definition of peripheral neuropathy used, and several studies have used different definitions for diagnosing HIV-SN. We used the method described by Cherry et al. which has also been used in a number of recent studies, and which requires both symptoms and signs. Subjects are considered to have HIV-SN if they have at least 1 symptom and either reduced or absent vibration sensation or ankle reflexes.

Toronto Clinical Scoring System (TCSS). The TCSS was developed as a screening tool for diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Subsequent studies validated its utility in reflecting diabetic neuropathy severity, its correlation with clinical electrophysiological measures, and microscopic morphological changes in peripheral nerve biopsy samples. The TCSS uses a simplified neurological examination assessing peripheral sensory perception, deep tendon reflexes, and the presence of neuropathy symptoms.

Sensory testing is performed on the first toe for the following: pinprick sensation using a Neurotip pin (Owen Mumford); temperature discrimination (warm- and cool-water-filled test tubes); light touch with a 10 g monofilament; and vibration with a maximally struck 128 Hz tuning fork, performed at the first toe. Responses were rated as normal or abnormal and were assigned 0 or 1 point, respectively. Scores range from 0 to a maximum of 19.

Deep tendon reflexes scores are graded for each side as loss, 2; reduced, 1; and normal, 0. The presence of each following neuropathy symptom scores 1 point: pain, numbness, tingling and weakness in the feet; the presence of similar upper limb symptoms; and the presence of unsteadiness on ambulation.

### Identification of the superficial peroneal nerve: anatomical study with surgical implications [^1175iaZd]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

The most important finding of the present study was that the identification of the superficial peroneal nerve should ideally be performed in ankle plantar flexion and inversion, revealing this nerve in 57% of the cases. The nerve was more frequently identified by palpation than by visualization. The fourth toe flexion sign did not aid in revealing a nerve that had already been identified with combined maximal plantar flexion and inversion. BMI was the only statistically significant determinant influencing identification of the superficial peroneal nerve.

According to Stephens and Kelly, the superficial peroneal nerve can be identified with the fourth toe flexion sign in 85% of the volunteers. In our study, we could not reproduce this figure. Once they had clinically identified the nerve, an infiltration with a local anaesthetic fluid followed. Identification was deemed positive if subsequent skin numbness was experienced in the superficial peroneal nerve supply area. It is, however, questionable whether such an infiltration is accurate enough in precise identification of the nerve. The anaesthetic agent at the infiltration site could diffuse widely, resulting in nerve inhibition and thereby a positive fourth toe flexion sign. Local anaesthetic diffusion could in our view result in false-positive values, overestimating the test results. Furthermore, it was suggested that in women the superficial peroneal nerve is more difficult to identify because of their increased amount of subcutaneous fat. Gender was not a significant determining factor for the identification of the superficial peroneal nerve in our study. However, the amount of subcutaneous fat at the anterolateral part of the ankle joint, as a separate determining factor, was not assessed.

### Is it possible to substitute the monofilament test for the ipswich touch test in screening for peripheral diabetic neuropathy? [^113QCWq7]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Medium credibility.

The recommendation both in Brazil and internationally is that patients with type II diabetes should be screened for peripheral neuropathy as soon as they are diagnosed with diabetes; nevertheless, in Brazil, this assessment is rarely carried out by health professionals in primary care due to the lack of instruments such as the monofilament. This negligence to screen for peripheral neuropathy can occur not only because of the lack of instruments but also because of the lack of training of health professionals, who do not know the relevance of this screening. The simple screening method (the IpTT), which presents a good level of agreement and specificity, may serve as a tracking strategy to alert health professionals in places where access is difficult. As patients with diabetes frequently present painful sensory neuropathy and clinical symptoms, such as burning, pain, tingling, and paraesthesia, whose nature is progressive, and assessed the neuropathic symptoms and classified them as mild, moderate or severe and related them to loss of sensitivity. We concluded that in both the monofilament test and the IpTT, patients who presented more severe neuropathic symptoms presented a significantly greater loss of protective sensation than patients with lower scores (Table 5).

Table 5
Measures of agreement (Kappa index) between the IpTT and monofilament test, and association of these tests with scores for neuropathic symptoms used in assessing loss of plantar sensitivity in diabetic patients — (n = 250)

A multicentre study showed similar results with 50% of patients presented moderate or severe pain. Another study reported that symptoms are not a reliable indicator of neuronal harm, as some patients with symptoms of severe pain have little sensory deficit, while others — without painful symptoms — have feet that are completely numb. Currently, a confirmed peripheral neuropathy diagnosis is recommended when the patient has alterations in their nerve conduction speed and one or more abnormal symptoms and signals (pain, burning sensation, tingling, others). However, if the nerve conduction speed of the patient is normal but there are still questions raised by the presence of said signals and symptoms, validated tests with level. A evidences must be used to evaluate small fiber diabetic neuropathy.

Considering that peripheral neuropathy can cause ulceration, is a major public health problem due to its negative impact on psychological and physical health, brings greater mortality, and imposes high costs on the state and family, it is necessary to encourage health professionals to screen for neuropathy as soon as diabetes is diagnosed in every health service that works with diabetic patients.

### Comparison of the accuracy of monofilament testing at various points of feet in peripheral diabetic neuropathy screening [^114H624u]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Examination of pain sensation

Pin prick test was used for this purpose. First, the patient was asked whether he/she felt needles sensation or numbness in the hands or feet. None of the patients experienced sensory impairment in their hands. Then, the test was performed with the pin using a standard procedure for all patients by the second author. In this procedure, while the patient's eyes were opened, the pin prick was vertically pressed on the skin behind the forearm of the patient until the patient began to express pain. The same test was then repeated with the same amount of pressure on the dorsal surface of the hand to cause pain. Then parts of the toes, forefoot, midfoot, hind foot were tested with the same pin and with the same amount of pressure and the patients were asked whether the pain in the feet is more (hyperesthesia)/less (hypoesthesia) than or similar to the pain in the hands.

Then in the next step, while the patient's eyes were closed, the test was performed with the above procedure and the patient was asked to raise his/her right hand when he felt pain. The locations that had sensory impairment (either as hyperesthesia or as hypoesthesia) were noted as positive sites. There are two types of sensory disturbances indicating the presence of neuropathy. For each patient, a pin with the same type was used.

Testing of the temperature sense

Hot and cold water pipes were used on the patient's thumb. Temperature of the cold water pipe was not less than 25°C, and temperature of the hot water pipe was not more than 45°C, because otherwise it would cause pain.

Examination of the sense of vibration

A 128 Hz tuning fork was used. First, the patient was taught, by placing the vibrating tuning fork on the forehead or sternum, that understanding the sense of shaking or vibration is intended, not just the tuning fork's contact with the body. After we realized that the patient understood what we meant, we vibrated the tuning fork with the stroke of the palm of the hand, and it was put on the bony prominence on the back of the thumb. The patient was asked to report the perception of both the start of the vibration sensation and cessation of vibration on dampening.

Lactic Acidosis

Inform patients of the importance of early recognition of symptoms of symptomatic hyperlactatemia or lactic acidosis syndrome, which include unexplained weight loss, abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, dyspnea, and motor weakness. Patients in whom these symptoms develop should seek medical attention immediately. Discontinuation of stavudine therapy may be required. Advise pregnant individuals of the potential risks of lactic acidosis syndrome/hepatic steatosis syndrome [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Hepatic Toxicity

Inform patients that hepatotoxicity, which may be fatal, may occur in patients treated with stavudine in combination with didanosine and hydroxyurea. Stavudine is contraindicated in combination with didanosine [see Contraindications (4)]. Avoid coadministration of stavudine with hydroxyurea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7)].

Peripheral Neuropathy

Inform patients that an important toxicity of stavudine is peripheral neuropathy. Make patients aware that peripheral neuropathy is manifested by numbness, tingling, or pain in hands or feet, and that these symptoms should be reported to their physicians. Counsel patients that peripheral neuropathy occurs with greatest frequency in patients who have advanced HIV-1 disease or a history of peripheral neuropathy, and discontinuation of stavudine may be required if toxicity develops.

### Diabetic neuropathies: clinical manifestations and current treatment options [^113mMe5y]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2006). Medium credibility.

Diabetic neuropathies are a heterogeneous group of disorders that include a wide range of abnormalities. They can be focal or diffuse, proximal or distal, affecting both peripheral and autonomic nervous systems, causing morbidity with significant impact on the quality of life of the person with diabetes, and can result in early death. Distal symmetric polyneuropathy, the most common form of diabetic neuropathy, usually involves small and large nerve fibers. Small-nerve-fiber neuropathy often presents with pain but without objective signs or electrophysiologic evidence of nerve damage, and is recognized as a component of the impaired glucose tolerance and metabolic syndromes. The greatest risk resulting from small-fiber neuropathy is foot ulceration and subsequent gangrene and amputation. Large-nerve-fiber neuropathies produce numbness, ataxia and uncoordination, impairing activities of daily living and causing falls and fractures. A careful history and detailed physical examination are essential for the diagnosis. Symptomatic therapy has become available and newer and better treatment modalities, based on etiologic factors, are being explored with potential for significant impact on morbidity and mortality. Preventive strategies and patient education still remain key factors in reducing complication rates and mortality.

### Common painful foot and ankle conditions: a review [^116sXxzw]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Morton neuroma, plantar fasciitis, and Achilles tendinopathy are foot and ankle conditions that are associated with pain and disability, but they can respond to nonoperative treatment.

Observations

Morton neuroma, consisting of interdigital neuronal thickening and fibrosis, is characterized by burning pain in the ball of the foot and numbness or burning pain that may radiate to the affected toes (commonly the third and fourth toes). First-line nonoperative therapy consists of reducing activities that cause pain, orthotics, and interdigital corticosteroid injection; however, approximately 30% of patients may not respond to conservative treatment. Plantar fasciitis accounts for more than 1 million patient visits per year in the US and typically presents with plantar heel pain. Fifteen years after diagnosis, approximately 44% of patients continue to have pain. First-line nonoperative therapy includes stretching of the plantar fascia and foot orthotics, followed by extracorporeal shockwave therapy, corticosteroid injection, or platelet-rich plasma injection. Midportion Achilles tendinopathy presents with pain approximately 2 to 6 cm proximal to the Achilles insertion on the heel. The primary nonoperative treatment involves eccentric strengthening exercises, but extracorporeal shockwave therapy may be used.

Conclusions and Relevance

Morton neuroma, plantar fasciitis, and Achilles tendinopathy are painful foot and ankle conditions. First-line therapies are activity restriction, orthotics, and corticosteroid injection for Morton neuroma; stretching and foot orthotics for plantar fasciitis; and eccentric strengthening exercises for Achilles tendinopathy.

Neuropathy

Neuropathic foot problems by glycemic status are listed in Table 3. Overall, 34 participants (7%) had neuropathy. A significant progression in symptom occurrence is noted for all categories of neuropathic problems by glycemic status. Neuropathy was present in those with normal glucose levels (5%), was increased in those with newly discovered IFG or diabetes (8%), and was highest in those with established diabetes (15%). Of the participants, 34 (7%) reported numbness and tingling and 38 (8%) reported foot pain; 6 participants reported both. Women were more likely to report numbness and/or tingling (P < 0.05). Of the women, 9% (21 of 240) had insensate feet compared with 6% (13 of 227) of men. Significant differences in age were found between those with and without neuropathy. The mean age of those with neuropathy was 42.5 ± 12.5 years, whereas the mean age of those without neuropathy was 36.7 ± 11.9 years (P < 0.01). Among the participants who reported a previous diagnosis of diabetes, no significant differences in time since diagnosis were found between those with and without neuropathy and only 22% had previously had their feet examined by a health care provider before the screening study.

Participants with insensate feet were significantly more likely to have foot deformities (hallux valgus, hammer toes, claw toes, and bony protuberances) (P < 0.01) and calluses (P < 0.001) than were those with sensation. Of those with insensate feet, 18% (6 of 34) had an abnormal foot shape versus 5% (20 of 427) of those with sensation. Of those with insensate feet, 41% (14 of 34) had plantar calluses versus 12% (52 of 433) of those with sensation. In addition, the mean number of foot problems among dysglycemic participants with insensate feet (3.15) was significantly greater than that among those with sensation (0.27), with foot problems defined as pain, numbness, tingling, callus, nail pathological changes, foot deformity, preulcer, current or past ulcer, and amputation (P < 0.001).

### Ingrown toenail management [^1142xmPQ]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on ingrown toenails:

- **Definition**: Ingrown toenails, also known as onychocryptosis, is a condition where the toenail grows into the surrounding skin, leading to pain and inflammation.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of ingrown toenails involves the nail plate penetrating into the periungual skin. This penetration can lead to skin irritation and overgrowth, causing the nail to become embedded in the skin.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of ingrown toenails in South Korea is estimated at 307.5 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for ingrown toenails include familial predisposition, poor foot hygiene, and occupations or sports that increase pressure on the toes. Other factors such as previous nail avulsion and foot bone deformity have been associated with poorly controlled and recurrence-prone ingrown toenails.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with ingrown toenails often present with pain, redness, and swelling at the affected site. If left untreated, the condition can progress to infection, abscess formation, and even cellulitis.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis for ingrown toenails is generally good with appropriate management.

Polyneuropathy screening

The polyneuropathy screening consisted of three components: a symptom questionnaire, neurological examination of the legs, and nerve conduction study of the sural nerves. Furthermore, the participants' medical records were scrutinized for a diagnosis of chronic axonal polyneuropathy by a neurologist and the presence of risk factors or causes.

The questionnaire of the screening consisted of 12 symptoms and could be answered with never, sometimes, or (almost) continuously. Symptoms included tingling, burning sensation, cotton‐wool feeling, muscle cramps, muscle pain not related to exercise, stabbing pain, weakness, numbness, tightness, and allodynia of the feet or legs. Additionally, the participants were asked if they had ever been diagnosed with polyneuropathy.

### Hammertoes: anatomy, pathophysiology, and comprehensive treatment strategies [^117UPaZm]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). Medium credibility.

Hammertoe is a common foot deformity that originates from the proximal interphalangeal joint of the lesser toes. The deformity involves an imbalance between the muscles and tendons that control toe movement, leading to deformity. Hammertoes can result from various factors, including genetic predisposition, ill-fitting footwear, trauma, or underlying medical conditions such as neuromuscular disorders or diabetic neuropathy. As the deformity progresses, patients may experience pain, difficulty walking, and development of corns or calluses on the affected toes. Treatment strategies for hammertoes range from nonsurgical to surgical, depending on the severity of discomfort and effect on patient function. Nonsurgical treatment includes wearing appropriate footwear, using orthotic devices, and performing targeted exercises to strengthen and stretch affected muscles. In more advanced cases, surgical options, such as tendon transfers, joint arthrodesis, or arthroplasty, may be considered. A comprehensive understanding of hammertoe anatomy, pathophysiology, and treatment options is crucial for the effective management of this condition.

VPT measurements

All patients with T2DM were asked if they experienced numbness, pain (prickling, stabbing, shooting, burning, or aching pain), and paresthesia (abnormal cold or heat sensation, allodynia, and hyperalgesia) in the toes, feet, legs, or upper limbs. An experienced physician then performed a neurological examination, including assessments of vibration, light touch, and Achilles tendon reflexes on both sides in the knee-standing position, noting their presence, weakening, or loss.

The vibration perception threshold (VPT) was assessed at the metatarsophalangeal joint of the big toe using a neurothesiometer (Bio-Thesiometer; Bio-Medical Instrument Co. Newbury, OH, USA). Initially, patients were instructed on how to recognize the vibration sensation by gradually increasing the amplitude from zero to maximum. The test then started from zero again, and patients were asked to indicate when they first felt the vibration. Measurements were taken on the plantar aspect of both big toes, three times consecutively for each toe, with the median of the three readings accepted as the VPT value.

Sensitivity to touch was tested using a 5.07/10-g Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (SWM) at four points on each foot: three on the plantar side and one on the dorsal side. The 10-g SWM was placed perpendicular to the skin, and pressure was applied until the filament just buckled, maintaining contact for 2 s. Inability to perceive the sensation at any site was considered abnormal. DPN was defined as VPT ≥ 25 V and/or inability to feel the monofilament, and participants were then divided into DPN and no DPN groups.

### Distal symmetric polyneuropathy: a definition for clinical research: report of the American Academy of Neurology, the American association of electrodiagnostic medicine, and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation [^1119DquR]. Neurology (2005). Medium credibility.

Distal symmetric polyneuropathy — consensus-based clinical phenotype and examination: The concept of distal symmetric polyneuropathy requires a clear definition of distal and symmetric features of polyneuropathy, where distal refers to those parts most distant from the center of the body, the polyneuropathy must begin in the feet, and symmetric indicates that the symptoms and signs are the same on both sides of the body; persistent or striking asymmetry of symptoms or signs is inconsistent with the case definition, and the case definition must encompass a description of symptoms and signs with an easily recognizable phenotype. Symptoms may be primarily sensory, primarily motor, or both, begin distally in the feet, and frequently include numbness, burning, prickling paresthesias, dysesthesias, and allodynia; distal symmetric polyneuropathy may be asymptomatic, especially in its early stage, with asymptomatic presentation more likely when positive sensory symptoms are lacking or when motor deficits alone are the presenting features. On examination, findings may include abnormalities of primary sensory modalities, motor weakness and atrophy, tendon reflex changes (especially depressed or absent ankle jerks), or autonomic system findings; sensory loss occurs in an acral, nondermatomal, non-single nerve distribution with signs evolving in a centripetal manner. Motor signs may include atrophy and weakness of intrinsic foot muscles and deformities such as hammertoes and pes cavus, although pes cavus alone is not sufficient evidence of polyneuropathy; tendon reflexes are often depressed or unelicitable, and relatively depressed or unelicitable ankle jerks are valuable signs. Signs of autonomic nervous system involvement may also constitute findings consistent with a distal symmetric polyneuropathy if small fibers are affected, with autonomic dysfunction suggested by abnormalities of sweating or circulatory instability in the feet.

Questionnaire on neuropathy symptoms

In order to examine the mental symptoms of neuropathy, The following 13 questions were Prepared: (1) pain in hands; (2) pain in feet; (3) numbness at terminal points; (4) paraesthesia of both feet; (5) burning sensation in the extremities; (6) cold sensation in the extremities; (7) constipation; (8) diarrhea; (9) muscular cramps; (10) fainting; (11) dizziness; (12) problems in urinating; (13) ulcers at feet. These symptoms were classified to the following 4 categories: asymptomatic, mild, moderate, and sever. The patients were accordingly divided to two groups of asymptomatic and symptomatic (the total of mild, moderate, and sever).

Semmes-Weinstein Monofilament Testing (SWMT)

In this study, we used Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (North Coast Medical, Inc. San Jose, CA) with a reproducible buckling stress 10 grams. Monofilament testing was performed on both feet of the patients by the first author, who had received the necessary training on the use of monofilament. The test at 3, 4, 8, and 10 points of the feet were evaluated. Three points in each foot were the great toe, the plantar aspect of the first metatarsal head; and the plantar aspect of the fifth metatarsal head. Four points in each foot, including: the plantar surface of hallux, and the first, third, and fifth metatarsal heads. Eight points in each foot, including: the dorsal aspect of the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth digits; the dorsal aspect of medial, central, and lateral aspect of mid foot and ten points in each foot, including: nine plantar sites (distal great toe, third toe, and fifth toe; first, third, and fifth metatarsal heads; medial foot, lateral foot, and heal) and one dorsal site.

### Nerve entrapment syndromes of the lower limb: a pictorial review [^111QAvBe]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

The deep peroneal nerve provides motor function to the muscles of the anterior compartment of the leg, including the tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, peroneus tertius and extensor hallucis longus, and its lateral terminal branch innervates two of the intrinsic muscles of the foot, the extensor digitorum brevis and extensor hallucis brevis.

In terms of sensory innervation, the deep peroneal nerve, during its course in the anterior compartment of the leg, provides branches to innervate the ankle joint, its medial terminal branch gives a sensory branch to the first metatarsophalangeal joint and provides cutaneous innervation to the adjacent sides and the webbing between the first two toes, and its lateral terminal branch gives sensory innervation to the tarsal joint as well as the middle three metatarsophalangeal joints.

Entrapment of the deep peroneal nerve can occur as it passes through the anterior tarsal tunnel, known as anterior tarsal tunnel syndrome (Fig. 8). This can be caused by extrinsic impingement by tight shoes, high heels or trauma and intrinsic impingement through dorsal osteophytes over the tibiotalar and talonavicular joints, other bony deformities or ganglion cysts. This can cause symptoms and signs including dysesthesia and paraesthesia on the dorsum of the foot, weakness or atrophy of the extensor digitorum brevis, positive Tinel sign over the course of the deep peroneal nerve and pain. The diagnosis can be supported by imaging features, such as increased nerve calibre and hypoechogenic appearance on ultrasound. MRI is particularly helpful for identifying the underlying compressive cause.

### A worker's struggle [^115chaNQ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Medium credibility.

I felt a heaviness in my chest. I had seen such cases before. In the months of my internship, I had treated rickshaw pullers, construction workers, welders, and tailors, all of whom were injured in similar ways. They had suffered crushed hands and legs, severed fingers, deep burns, assaults, and head trauma, and some were even brought in dead. These injuries did not just take a piece of flesh but an entire livelihood.

After handing over the paperwork for the patient's admission and further care to one of my fellow interns, I immediately asked the patient to undergo an X-ray, marking his ticket as urgent. His fingers had been severely injured (partially severed), but there was still a chance to save them, at least to some extent. The X-ray was crucial to assess the damage and plan the next steps.

He returned shortly with the X-ray in hand. Without wasting a moment, I escorted him to the operating room. I quickly scrubbed in, donned a gown, and draped a McIntosh over it. Calling the operating theater nurse and assistant, I requested the necessary equipment. They promptly provided everything I needed, and I additionally asked for two K-wires. The experienced operating theater assistant raised an eyebrow, grimacing slightly. "K-wires? Here?" he asked, his tone laced with skepticism.

I met his gaze firmly and replied, "Certainly. We can save at least two fingers entirely, though one might require amputation. When there's a chance to restore functionality, why wouldn't we take it?"
