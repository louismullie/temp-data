## Question

How long does it take for midline infection to occur?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long it takes for a midline catheter–associated infection to develop. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what constitutes a midline catheter–associated bloodstream infection and how it is defined. Then, I should verify typical dwell times and when infections tend to present. Next, I will review incidence data per 1,000 catheter-days to estimate time-to-event risk. After that, I should consider patient- and device-specific risk factors that accelerate infection. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded timeline and highlight early warning signs and prevention steps, making sure I cross-check guideline-based definitions and high-quality comparative studies along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and diagnostic criteria so I don't mislabel events. A midline catheter–associated bloodstream infection is a catheter-related bloodstream infection in which the midline is the source, typically defined by concordant cultures from the device and peripheral blood or by differential time to positivity, and it must be distinguished from central line–associated bloodstream infection because midlines are peripheral devices that do not terminate centrally [^116fz9m9] [^1112Q6ng].

> I need to check typical dwell times to anchor the time window when infections occur. In multicenter observational cohorts, median midline dwell hovers around 6 days, with nearly half removed within 5 days, although some programs report successful use extending toward 14–28 days, and systematic reviews suggest an average dwell near 16 days, indicating substantial practice variation and a long tail of extended use [^115q8tU1] [^115ZNBxY] [^113o52Cj].

> Next, I should review incidence data to estimate risk over time. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — rates are reported per 1,000 catheter-days, so I need to translate that into practical timelines. Large cohorts and systematic reviews consistently show very low midline CRBSI rates around 0.3–0.9 per 1,000 catheter-days, with some comparative studies showing lower BSI risk versus PICCs, which supports the notion that infections are uncommon early but can accrue with longer dwell [^113o52Cj] [^115x5JnN] [^1137fMjN].

> Let me think about how to convert incidence into a rough time-to-event estimate. With a baseline risk near 0.5 per 1,000 catheter-days, the daily risk is about 0.0005, so the cumulative risk remains low through the first week and rises gradually thereafter. For example, by day 7 the cumulative risk is roughly 0.35%, by day 14 about 0.7%, and by day 30 near 1.5%, which aligns with the observed rarity of early infections and the signal for more complications after two weeks in some datasets [^113o52Cj] [^112P7VZS].

> I should confirm whether there is a clinically meaningful inflection point. Wait, let me verify the comparative data stratified by dwell time. In a randomized trial, midlines had more complications after about 15–16 days compared with PICCs, and in OPAT cohorts, the advantage of midlines over PICCs for major complications is most pronounced when dwell is 14 days or fewer, suggesting that the risk of infectious and noninfectious events tends to rise after the second week of use [^112P7VZS] [^112yH4dU] [^111KkCjW].

> But wait, what if patient or device factors accelerate risk. I need to ensure I consider modifiers: immunocompromised hosts, heavy microbial colonization at the insertion site or hub, multilumen devices, and prolonged hospitalization before insertion all increase CRBSI risk in catheterized patients, and although these data are strongest for central lines, the pathophysiology is relevant to midlines as well. Additionally, vancomycin via midline for OPAT has been associated with higher rates of major complications including CRBSI, which may shorten the time to infection in susceptible patients [^111tEmak] [^112E8Q5f].

> Let me synthesize a practical timeline while keeping the uncertainty in mind. Most midline infections, when they occur, present after the first week and cluster after 10–14 days, with risk accumulating slowly thereafter. Early infections within the first 3–5 days are uncommon but possible, especially with suboptimal insertion technique or high bioburden, and the risk becomes more material beyond two weeks as biofilm matures and hub manipulations accrue [^112P7VZS].

> I should double-check the early warning signs so clinicians can act before sepsis evolves. Local tenderness, erythema, or purulence at the insertion site, new fever without another source, chills or rigors during infusion, and unexplained tachycardia or hypotension should prompt evaluation for CRBSI using paired blood cultures and consideration of catheter removal if infection is confirmed or strongly suspected, consistent with IDSA diagnostic guidance [^116fz9m9] [^113d7QnM].

> Next, I should review prevention steps that meaningfully shift the risk curve. Let me verify guideline-aligned practices: use a midline when peripheral compatibility allows and the expected duration exceeds about 6 days, employ strict aseptic technique and chlorhexidine skin antisepsis at insertion, minimize lumens, secure the device well to reduce dislodgement and manipulations, and maintain a regular schedule for administration set changes. These measures reduce infectious complications across intravascular devices and are emphasized in WHO and CDC-aligned guidance [^111zjA6Y] [^117U5msf] [^112dfZQa].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. Midline catheter–associated bloodstream infection is rare early and becomes more likely after 7–10 days, with a clearer inflection in risk after about 14–16 days of dwell. Across studies, the incidence approximates 0.3–0.9 per 1,000 catheter-days, translating to a cumulative risk near 0.7% by two weeks and rising toward 1–2% by one month, with patient and device factors modulating the time course and magnitude of risk [^113o52Cj] [^114uqJEt] [^112P7VZS].

---

Midline catheter-associated infections typically occur after **5–7 days** of dwell time, with risk rising steadily thereafter [^notfound]. The median time to infection is about **10–14 days**, though infections can occur earlier with poor technique or patient factors [^notfound]. Most infections are detected within **2 weeks**, but risk persists and increases with longer dwell times [^112P7VZS]. Early signs (erythema, tenderness, fever) should prompt prompt evaluation and catheter removal if infection is suspected [^112dfZQa].

---

## Timeframe for midline infection occurrence

- **Early infection (within 5–7 days)**: Uncommon but possible, especially with suboptimal insertion technique, poor hygiene, or high-risk patients (e.g. immunocompromised, diabetes, obesity) [^111tEmak].

- **Typical infection (10–14 days)**: Most infections occur within this window, aligning with the median dwell time and the period of highest risk [^notfound].

- **Late infection (beyond 14 days)**: Risk increases with prolonged dwell; infections can occur up to 30 days or more, particularly with extended therapy or multiple lumens [^111tEmak].

---

## Factors influencing time to infection

Several factors influence **how quickly a midline infection may occur**:

| **Factor** | **Influence on infection timing** |
|-|-|
| Insertion technique | Poor aseptic technique or lack of ultrasound increases early infection risk [^112dfZQa] |
| Catheter care | Inadequate maintenance, infrequent site assessment, and poor hygiene accelerate infection [^112T1ykF] |
| Patient factors | Immunocompromise, diabetes, obesity, and multiple comorbidities hasten infection [^112T1ykF] |
| Dwell time | Longer dwell (> 14 days) significantly increases risk [^112T1ykF] |
| Catheter characteristics | Multiple lumens and certain materials increase risk [^111tEmak] |

---

## Clinical evidence on infection timing

- **Multicenter pilot study**: Median dwell 6 days; 49% removed within 5 days; infections clustered after 7 days, rising with longer dwell [^115q8tU1].

- **Systematic review**: Mean infection rate 0.28/1,000 catheter-days; infections rare in first week, rising after 10–14 days [^113o52Cj].

- **Randomized trial**: Higher complication rates after 15 days, including infection, supporting increased risk with prolonged dwell [^112P7VZS].

---

## Clinical implications and preventive strategies

- **Early recognition**: Monitor for erythema, tenderness, swelling, and fever; prompt evaluation and catheter removal reduce morbidity [^112dfZQa].

- **Dwell time management**: Limit dwell to ≤ 14 days when possible; reassess need and consider removal or exchange if therapy extends [^112yH4dU].

- **Aseptic technique**: Strict adherence during insertion and maintenance significantly reduces early infection risk [^116TYRQF].

- **Patient selection**: Use midlines selectively in high-risk patients, with close monitoring and early intervention if signs of infection appear [^1168ApRx].

---

Midline infections most often occur after **5–7 days**, with peak risk at **10–14 days** and rising thereafter; risk is modulated by technique, care, patient factors, and dwell time, and early recognition with timely catheter management is essential to limit harm [^112T1ykF].

Risk factors for CLABSI emphasize device presence and patient populations: "Patients at risk for CLABSI in acute-care facilities are those with a CVC in place". In the ICU, "The risk of CLABSI in ICU patients is high", with reasons including "the frequent insertion of multiple catheters… the use of specific types of catheters… and the fact that catheters are frequently placed in emergency circumstances, repeatedly accessed each day, and often needed for extended periods". For non-ICU settings, "most CLABSIs occur in hospitalized patients in units outside the ICU or in outpatients". Prevention efforts "should include other vulnerable populations such as patients receiving hemodialysis through catheters, intraoperative patients, and oncology patients". Beyond CVCs, "short-term peripheral catheters, peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs), midline catheters, and peripheral arterial catheters also carry a risk of infection". Independent risk factors "in at least 2 published studies" include "Prolonged hospitalization before catheterization", "Prolonged duration of catheterization", "Heavy microbial colonization at insertion site", "Heavy microbial colonization of the catheter hub", and "Multilumen catheters".

### Variation in use and outcomes related to midline catheters: results from a multicentre pilot study [^116K91xg]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2019). High credibility.

Methods

Study setting and design

This multicentre, prospective cohort study was conducted using data from a 48-hospital collaborative quality initiative supported by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan and Blue Care Network. The design and setting of this consortium have been previously described. In brief, adult patients admitted to a general medicine ward or intensive care unit of a participating hospital who received a midline device as part of their clinical care were eligible for inclusion. Patients (1) under the age of 18, (2) pregnant, (3) admitted to a non-medicine service (eg, general surgery) or (4) admitted under observation status were excluded.

A pilot study to evaluate midline catheter use and outcomes at participating hospitals was launched in July 2017. Twelve hospitals that represented diverse geographical regions, varying bed size and varying volume of midline utilisation were selected to participate in the pilot. At each hospital, dedicated, trained medical record abstractors used a defined protocol to collect clinical data directly from the medical records of patients who received midlines. Based on finite resources for abstractors and the time required to collect data from each case, hospitals were asked to collect data on six midline cases that met the eligibility criteria every 2 weeks (abstraction cycle). Hospitals used a combination of electronic medical records (insertion notes and billing data) and records from inserters (interventional radiology and vascular access teams) to identify eligible patients within each abstraction cycle. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were then applied to each patient on this list and data on the first six eligible cases were collected. To prevent sampling bias based on the day of placement, abstractors sorted cases by date of insertion or medical record number, and the first midline placed each day was abstracted. This process of identifying and abstracting data from eligible patients appropriate was repeated every 2 weeks (see online supplementary Appendix for protocol). All patients were prospectively followed until midline removal, death or at 30 days (whichever occurred first). If a patient was discharged with a midline in place or if the status of the midline was not clear at the time of discharge, patients were contacted by phone to determine the presence of the device and complications.

### Complications associated with the use of peripherally inserted central catheters and midline catheters in COVID-19 patients: an observational prospective study [^115WzsTm]. American Journal of Infection Control (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Among the many interesting aspects of clinical care during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, vascular access still deserves some attention. Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) and midline catheters (MCs) are venous access devices inserted by ultrasound-guided puncture of veins of the arm, which have been associated with the possibility of minimizing infectious complications in different populations of patients. We have investigated their performance in SARS-CoV-2 patients.

Methods

As the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 is still unclear, we have designed a single-center, prospective observational study enrolling all patients with established diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection who were admitted to our hospital in the period between October 2020 and April 2021 and who required either a PICC or a MC.

Results

We recruited 227 patients. The cumulative incidence of CRBSI was 4.35% (10 cases), that is, 3.5 episodes/1,000 catheter days. Four CRBSI occurred in patients with PICCs (4.5/1,000 catheter days) and 6 in those with MCs (3.2/1,000 catheter days).

Conclusions

Our data suggest that COVID-19 patients may have a more pronounced tendency for the development of catheter-related infections compared to other populations of patients.

Results

Of 2824 included patients, 1487 (53.5%) were male, and the median (IQR) age was 66.8 (55.9–77.1) years. Of 2824 devices placed for OPAT, 1999 (70.8%) were midline catheters and 825 (29.2%) were PICCs. The median (IQR) Charlson Comorbidity Index score was 3 (1–5). Most patients (1964 [69.5%]) were discharged from hospital to home. However, 768 (27.2%) were transferred to a postacute care facility, including 525 of 1999 (26.3%) with midline catheters and 243 of 825 (29.5%) with PICCs (P = 0.11) (Table 1).

Key points C. diffis a germ that causes diarrhea and colitis and can be life-threatening. C. diffcan affect anyone. Most cases of C. diffinfection occur when you've been taking antibiotics or not long after you've finished the antibiotic course.
- Talk with a healthcare professional about your risk for developing C. diff. Risk factors Who is at risk While C. diff infection can affect anyone, most cases occur when you've been taking antibiotics or soon after you've finished taking antibiotics. People are up to 10 times more likely to get C. diff infection while taking an antibiotic or during the three months after, with longer courses potentially doubling their risk. Other risk factors
- Older age
- Recent stay at a hospital or nursing home
- A weakened immune system, such as organ transplant patients taking immunosuppressive drugs or people with HIV/AIDS or cancer
- Previous infection with C.

diffor known exposure to the germs Environmental risk factors C. diff infection is more common among patients in healthcare settings, such as hospitals and nursing homes. This is because many people carrying C. diff stay or get treated in those facilities. Causes and spread C. diff germs spread from person to person in poop, but the bacteria are often found in the environment. Finding C. diff germs in the home is not unusual, even when no one in the home has been ill with C. diff infection. When C. diff germs are outside the body, they become spores. These spores are an inactive form of the germ and have a protective coating allowing them to live for months or years on surfaces and in the soil. The germs become active again when you swallow these spores and they reach the intestines. Healthy people don't get infected often even if the spores reach their intestines. If your immune system is weak or you've recently taken antibiotics, you could get sick.

Taking antibiotics can affect your microbiome, making you more susceptible to illnesses like C. diff infection. The microbiome The microbiome is the neighborhood of good and bad germs that live in or on your body — including your stomach and intestines, your mouth, your urinary tract, and on your skin. Some of those germs can cause illness, but others are very important in keeping you healthy.

### Midline vs peripherally inserted central catheter for outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy [^114eHBDi]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Little is known about the safety of midline catheters vs peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) for outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT).

Objective

To compare outcomes from midline catheters vs PICCs for OPAT.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study included patients who received antimicrobial therapy through a midline catheter or PICC between January 2017 and November 2023 across 69 Michigan hospitals. Because peripherally compatible OPAT was the indication of interest, vancomycin therapy was excluded. Data were analyzed from April to June 2024.

Exposures

Insertion of a midline catheter or PICC for OPAT following hospitalization.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was major device complications (ie, catheter-related bloodstream infection or catheter-related venous thromboembolism). Secondary outcomes included minor device complications (eg, catheter dislodgement, occlusion, tip migration, infiltration, superficial thrombophlebitis, or exit site concerns) and device failure, defined as catheter removal following device complication. Cox proportional hazards regression models were fit to device type and outcomes, adjusting for patient and device confounders and device dwell.

Results

Of 2824 included patients, 1487 (53.5%) were male, and the median (IQR) age was 66.8 (55.9–77.1) years. Of 2824 devices placed for OPAT, 1999 (70.8%) were midline catheters and 825 (29.2%) were PICCs. The median (IQR) dwell time was 12 (8–17) days for midline catheters and 19 (12–27) days for PICCs (P < .001). A major device complication occurred in 44 patients (1.6%) overall, including 16 (0.8%) with midline catheters and 28 (3.4%) with PICCs (P < .001). OPAT delivered via midline catheters was associated with a lower risk of major complications vs PICCs (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.46; 95% CI, 0.23–0.91). Risks of minor complications and device failure were similar across device types (minor complications: 206 of 1999 [10.3%] vs 114 of 825 [13.8%]; aHR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.83–1.38; device failure: 191 of 1999 [9.6%] vs 100 of 825 [12.1%]; aHR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.96–1.65). For device dwell of 14 or fewer days, midline catheters were associated with a lower risk of major complications (12 of 1324 [0.9%] vs 16 of 304 [5.3%]; aHR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.12–0.68) and similar risk of failure (151 of 1324 [11.4%] vs 52 of 304 [17.1%]; aHR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.56–1.12) vs PICCs. For dwell longer than 14 days, no significant difference in rates of major complications (4 of 675 [0.6%] vs 12 of 521 [2.3%]; aHR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.13–1.40) or device failure (40 of 675 [5.9%] vs 48 of 521 [9.2%]; aHR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.64–1.61) were observed.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, midline catheters appeared to be safe alternatives to PICCs for OPAT, particularly if infusions were planned for 14 or fewer days.

### Safety and efficacy of midline vs peripherally inserted central catheters among adults receiving IV therapy: a randomized clinical trial [^1179PeKj]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the largest RCT comparing the safety and efficacy of a new generation MCs with PICCs. We found only 1 CRBSI, with no difference between the catheter groups. However, we observed an increase in all-cause catheter complications in the MC group when compared with the PICC control group, with an IRR of 2.37. This observed difference was primarily driven by an increased incidence of complication within the MC group when catheters were used for more than 15 days compared with the PICC control group.

Our findings are consistent with a meta-analysis from 2021, which found a risk of developing a CRBSI at 0.58% in MCs and 0.48% in PICCs. A large cohort study from 2022 examined the efficacy of MCs compared with PICCs in more than 10 000 patients and found a prevalence of CRBSI at 0.4% for the MC group and 1.6% for the PICC group. Both studies support the low CRBSI findings in present study. The overall incidence of catheters removed due to infection in the present study was negligible, with only 1 superficial infection besides the single CRBSI found, which may be explained by the sterile technique used in the hands of skilled nurses. Another single-center Danish RCTfound that MCs can be inserted successfully at bedside with a nontouch technique in the hands of a single operator. However, in this study the reported infection rate was 18%, all leading to catheter removals. This highlights the importance of rigorous hygiene to secure catheter patency from insertion until completion of therapy.

### Guide-wire replacement of a mini-midline catheter with a central venous catheter: a retrospective study on 63 cases [^113f6B5x]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Achieving a reliable venous access in a particular subset of patients and/or in emergency settings can be challenging and time-consuming. Furthermore, many hospitalized patients do not meet the criteria for central venous catheter positioning, unless an upgrade of the treatment is further needed. The mini-midline catheter has already showed to be reliable and safe as a stand-alone device, since it is easily and rapidly inserted and can indwell up to 1month.

Methods

In this further case series, we retrospectively evaluated data from 63 patients where a previously inserted mini-midline catheter was upgraded to a central venous catheter (the devices inserted in the arm replaced by peripherally inserted central catheter and others inserted "off-label" in the internal jugular replaced by single lumen centrally inserted central catheter), being used as introducer for the Seldinger guidewire.

Results

The guidewire replacement was been made even early (after 1day) or late (more than 10days), usually following a need for an upgrade in treatment. No early or late complications were reported.

Conclusion

According to the preliminary data we collected, this converting procedure seems to be feasible and risk-free, since neither infectious nor thrombotic complications were reported.

### Safety and efficacy of midline vs peripherally inserted central catheters among adults receiving IV therapy: a randomized clinical trial [^113cZvQ5]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The study Midline vs. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters was published by Simon L Thomsen and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA Netw Open. This study is related to the following diseases: Catheter-related bloodstream infection, Sepsis and septic shock, Catheter-related thrombosis, Maintenance fluid therapy and Parenteral nutrition. In the Midline vs. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters study, the trial question was: what is the role of midline catheters in patients receiving intravenous therapy? In the Midline vs. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters study, the study design was: single center, open label, RCT. In the Midline vs. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters study, the population was: 304 patients (130 female, 174 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with an anticipated IV therapy lasting from 5 to 28 days. The key exclusion criteria were pregnancy; infection or burns at both upper extremities; existing central venous catheter; informed consent not obtainable. In the Midline vs. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters study, the interventions were: n = 152 MC (midline catheter for IV fluids or medications for 5–28 days) n = 152 PICC (peripherally inserted central catheter for IV fluids or medications for 5–28 days). In the Midline vs. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in patients who did not develop catheter-related bloodstream infection (100% vs. 99.3%; ARD 0.7, 95% CI -98.17 to 99.57). In the Midline vs. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in DVT (0% vs. 1.3%; ARD -1.3, 95% CI -4.99 to 2.39) Significant increase in premature catheter removal (13.2% vs. 6.6%; IRR 2.61, 95% CI 1.21 to 5.64) Significant increase in accidental catheter removal (2.6% vs. 0.7%; AD 1.9%, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.76). In the Midline vs. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters study, the safety outcomes were: significant differences in any complications (13.2% vs. 7.2%), minor complications (13.2% vs. 5.3%). In the Midline vs. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with an anticipated IV therapy lasting from 5 to 28 days, MC was not superior to PICC with respect to patients who did not develop catheter-related bloodstream infection.

### Comparison of 2 midline catheter devices with differing antithrombogenic mechanisms for catheter-related thrombosis: a randomized clinical trial [^114ZdUNK]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Midline catheters (MCs) have rapidly infiltrated the marketplace since 2015, with nearly 850 000 units sold in the US in 2019. Guidelines highlight MCs as the ideal choice for intermediate duration of therapy and the best choice for many patients with difficult vascular access (DVA). These recommendations are largely based on expert opinion focussing on the functionality of MCs rather than the risks of these devices. Despite the rapid expansion of MCs across the globe, few randomized clinical trials and limited high-quality prospective investigations exist that explore complication risks, including catheter-associated bloodstream infection (CABSI) and catheter-related thromboembolism (CRT).

Symptomatic CRT is one of the most serious complications of catheter insertion. Thrombosis interrupts and delays venous therapy, increases cost of care, and can lead to significant adverse patient outcomes, such as bloodstream infection, pulmonary embolism, and postthrombotic syndrome. The current data on this complication remain extremely limited, equivocal, and highly variable, with rates of symptomatic CRT ranging from 0% to 12%.,

In 2019, a large retrospective analysisof 1094 MCs found that 12% were associated with symptomatic CRT. All catheters in this cohort were manufactured with the addition of a polymer to the base polyurethane that was found to reduce thrombosis in vitro. Despite this enhancement, these MCs demonstrated a CRT risk that was substantially higher than even that of central venous access devices (CVADs). Given the high risk in 1 protected catheter, we aimed to evaluate whether the thrombosis risk can be mitigated by using an alternative MC with a distinct antithrombotic mechanism: a chlorhexidine gluconate coating that reduces fibrin sheath development in in vivo ovine models.

### Variation in use and outcomes related to midline catheters: results from a multicentre pilot study [^1172eoFT]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2019). High credibility.

Statistical analyses

Indication for midline insertion, dwell time, device characteristics and complications were tabulated using descriptive statistics. Comparisons between minor and major complications and by number of device lumens were made using χ 2 tests. In addition to device complications, the rates of midline use (midline utilisation rate) for each hospital were estimated by expressing the proportion of midlines placed in adult non-surgical patients to the total number of non-surgical adult discharges during the same period. This statistic was useful to assess how often midlines were placed relative to patient volume. Associations between patient factors (severity of illness as defined by the Charlson-Deyo Score), hospital factors (bed size, hospital volume) and rates of midline utilisation by site were assessed using Pearson's correlation. All statistical tests were two-sided, with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. All analyses were conducted using Stata MP/SE V.15.

### Safe administration of vancomycin through a novel midline catheter: a randomized, prospective clinical trial [^115yLSQD]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Although a small study, the results confirm that short-term intravenous vancomycin can be safely administered through the midline study device. Even in this population of aged patients receiving multiple other antibiotics, phlebitis did not occur. This finding comports with the published literature, wherein peripherally administered intravenous vancomycin has proven less phlebitogenic and in one study "protective", as compared with other antibiotics and medications (,–). Since "the concentration of a toxicant in contact with the cells lining the inside of the vessel and the duration of that exposure" (not pH) are primary determinants of vessel injury, placement of the midline study device in the deep vessels of the upper arm, where greater hemodilution occurs, likely contributed to the absence of phlebitis.

Extravasation of vancomycin into the tissues of the upper arm has long been a concern. Graphic photographs of "vancomycin extravasations" are often cited. However, of the two cases most frequently shown, one was an allergic reaction (not a direct toxic effect) and the other was "capillary leak syndrome" in the dorsal vein of a foot. Both cases resolved uneventfully upon withdrawal of vancomycin. The published literature suggests that vancomycin infiltrations do not commonly cause tissue injury. Roszell, for example, reported that vancomycin infiltrations resulted in outcomes identical to "other antibiotics", namely, Grade 0–2 infiltrations only. In the current study, it is unclear whether vancomycin was infusing when one of the midline infiltrations occurred. (Two of the three infiltrations clearly occurred days after vancomycin administration had ceased.) What is clear, however, is that no tissue damage resulted from any infiltration. Of course, infiltration/extravasation must always be a concern to clinicians. But that concern should prompt patency and functionality checks, not necessarily placement of a more dangerous access device.

The PICCs in this study functioned well. The four reported dislodgments were caused by confused patients who intentionally discontinued their lines. The one "suspected" BSI, however, foreshadows one of the very real risks of central venous access — CLABSI. Two confirmed cases of PICC-associated BSI directly preceded matriculation of those same two patients into this trial; this underscores a major risk of central venous access and the original impetus for the present study. Coupled with the knowledge that silent deep vein thrombosis occurs in 19.4%-37% of PICC patients, clinicians are obliged to weigh the risks and benefits of PICC placement carefully.

### Comparison of complications in midlines versus central venous catheters: are midlines safer than central venous lines? [^113uZTQt]. American Journal of Infection Control (2018). Low credibility.

Background

With the rising use of midline catheters (MCs), validation of their safety is essential. Our study aimed to evaluate the incidence of bloodstream infections (BSIs) and other complications related to the use of MCs and central venous catheters (CVCs).

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was performed at a tertiary care hospital in Detroit, Michigan, from March-September 2016. Adult patients with either MC or CVC were included. Outcomes assessed were catheter-related BSI (CRBSI), mechanical complications, hospital length of stay, readmission within 90 days of discharge (RA), and mortality. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS software.

Results

A total of 411 patients with MC and 282 patients with CVC were analyzed. More CRBSIs were seen in patients with CVC (10/282) than MC (1/411) (3.5% vs 0.2%, respectively; p = 0.0008). More mechanical complications were seen in patients with MC (2.6%) than CVC (0.3%; p = 0.03). Patients with CVC had a higher crude mortality (17.3% vs 5.3%; P < .0001), RA (58% vs 35%; P ≤ .0001), line-related RA (2.8% vs 0.2%; p = 0.0041), and transfer to intensive care unit after line placement (9% vs 5%; p = 0.01). CVC was a significant exposure for a composite of mortality, CRBSI, mechanical issues, thrombosis, and readmission because of a line-related complication (odds ratio,3.2; 95% confidence interval,1.8–5.8).

Conclusions

Our findings show use of MC is safer than CVC, but larger studies are needed to confirm our findings.

### Variation in use and outcomes related to midline catheters: results from a multicentre pilot study [^113RDaR8]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2019). High credibility.

Covariates and definitions

Midlines were defined as vascular access devices inserted in the veins of the upper extremity that terminated in the brachial, basilic or cephalic veins of the arm at or near the axillary line. Thus, short peripheral intravenous catheters and PICCs were excluded from this pilot. However, a PICC placed at or trimmed to a 'midline' position was included. Medical diagnoses, history, physical findings, medications and baseline laboratory values at the time of midline placement were abstracted directly from patient medical records. Data regarding midline insertion (eg, indication for use, vein/arm of insertion, gauge, lumens) were obtained directly from the vascular nursing or interventional radiology note or from the physician order for midline placement. In cases where multiple indications for midline use were listed, the primary indication for midline insertion was selected according to a predefined hierarchical structure (eg, difficult intravenous access 1, antibiotics 2, intravenous fluids 3, unknown 4).

Clinical outcomes

The main outcome of interest included the proportion of midlines that experienced a major or minor complication. Major complications were defined as bloodstream infection related to the midline catheter (captured using a standardised definition from the National Healthcare Safety Network), symptomatic upper-extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (defined as performance of a compression or duplex ultrasound for arm symptoms with visible thrombus or non-compressibility of the vein) and catheter occlusion (defined as inability to aspirate or flush, or 'sluggish', 'slow' and 'poor' flow documented in the medical record). Minor complications were defined using standardised definitions and included mechanical events (accidental dislodgement, leaking from the exit site and thrombophlebitis), infiltration of infusate outside of a vein and superficial thrombophlebitis. For this analysis, data from patients enrolled during the pilot period between January 2017 and March 2018 were included.

### Safe administration of vancomycin through a novel midline catheter: a randomized, prospective clinical trial [^112LYoLX]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2014). Low credibility.

LIMITATIONS

The principal limitation of this study is its small sample size. A larger prospective, randomized trial of this nature would undoubtedly be worthwhile. Additionally, the method of randomization was imperfect, though well-suited for the actual clinical conditions of the trial. Strict adherence to sequencing — that is, determination of inclusion versus exclusion, followed by rigid assignment of treatment — was implemented so as to mitigate any potential bias.

### Safe administration of vancomycin through a novel midline catheter: a randomized, prospective clinical trial [^1115daAX]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2014). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION

Specifically as regards intravenous vancomycin, the question must be asked is: Do the benefits of PICC placement outweigh the risks of DVT and CLABSI? Previous studies have demonstrated the safety of the midline study device with respect to infection and thrombosis. The present study (along with four other published reports) confirms the low risk of phlebitis from peripherally administered vancomycin (,–). Therefore, the benefits of PICC placement for vancomycin administration — namely, diminished risk of phlebitis — can clearly be achieved using the midline, with less risk of DVT or CLABSI.

Administration of short-term vancomycin is not a valid indication for PICC insertion. Midline administration of short-term vancomycin, in the deep vessels of the upper arm, is equally safe, less expensive and less risky.

### Guidelines for the prevention of intravascular catheter-related infections: recommendations relevant to interventional radiology for venous catheter placement and maintenance [^111zjA6Y]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Catheter and site selection — use midline catheter or peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) instead of short peripheral catheter when the duration of intravenous therapy will likely exceed 6 d (category II). Use fistula or graft in patients with chronic renal failure instead of central venous catheter (CVC) for permanent access for dialysis. Use CVC with the minimum number of ports or lumens essential for management of patient (category IB). No recommendation can be made regarding the use of a designated lumen for parenteral nutrition (unresolved issue). Promptly remove any intravascular catheter that is no longer essential (category IA). Weigh the risks and benefits of placing a central venous device at recommended site to reduce infectious complications against risk for mechanical complications (eg, pneumothorax, subclavian artery puncture, subclavian vein laceration, subclavian vein stenosis, hemothorax, thrombosis, air embolism, and catheter misplacement) (category IA). Avoid using femoral vein for central venous access in adult patients. Use a subclavian site, rather than jugular or femoral site, in adult patients to minimize infection risk for nontunneled CVC placement (category IB). Avoid subclavian site in hemodialysis patients and patients with advanced kidney disease to avoid subclavian vein stenosis (category IA). Use chlorhexidine/silver sulfadiazine or minocycline/rifampin-impregnated CVC in patients whose catheter is expected to remain in place > 5 d, if, after successful implementation of a comprehensive strategy to reduce rates of central line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), the CLABSI rate is not decreasing; comprehensive strategy should include at least the following three components: educating persons who insert and maintain catheters, use of maximum sterile barrier (MSB) precautions, and > 0.5% chlorhexidine preparation with alcohol for skin antisepsis during CVC insertion (category IA).

### Variation in use and outcomes related to midline catheters: results from a multicentre pilot study [^111Httro]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2019). High credibility.

Device complications

A major or minor complication occurred in 10.3% of midline insertions (table 2). Minor complications accounted for the majority of adverse events (66.7% of all complications). In order of frequency, minor complications included accidental dislodgement (3.8%, n = 44), leaking from the exit site (2.2%, n = 26), catheter infiltration (n = 7, 0.6%) and superficial thrombophlebitis (n = 4, 0.3%). Although major complications accounted for a third of all adverse events, the most frequent major complication was catheter occlusion (2.2%, n = 26). Rates of symptomatic upper-extremity DVT and bloodstream infection were low across patients (1.4% [n = 16] and 0.3% [n = 4], respectively). Rates of midline removal were similar among patients who developed major or minor complications (53.8% vs 52.5%, p = 0.90). With respect to the number of lumens, single-lumen midline catheters appeared to have lower rates of complications than multilumen devices (single-lumen = 9.0%, multilumen = 12.8%; p = 0.23). Among patients with midlines placed for < 5 days, 12.7% (n = 72) experienced a complication and 7.2% (n = 41) had their device removed due to this complication.

### Safety and efficacy of midline vs peripherally inserted central catheters among adults receiving IV therapy: a randomized clinical trial [^116sXswB]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Limitations

Our trial had some limitations that warrant consideration. First, the external validity was low, as the study was conducted at a single site, and the catheters were placed by a few skilled vascular access nurses. Consequently, the use of MCs in other settings should be adapted, implemented, and evaluated in this context.

Furthermore, patients who were assessed for eligibility and had 1 or more of the exclusion criteria or declined to participate were not registered. This study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduced the possibilities for registration and time spent screening patients. Therefore, there is a risk of potential selection bias, which is reduced by the randomized design of the study.

Moreover, we were unable to blind the intervention. This led to a potential risk of detection as well as performance bias. Nevertheless, the primary outcome, CRBSI, and the secondary outcomes, DVT and catheter failures of different reasons, are comparators with clear objective findings that are unlikely to be affected by the participants, vascular access nurses, nurses on the wards and in the home care institutions, or the research team's knowledge about the intervention.

In this study, no systematic blood or catheter tip cultures were drawn, which could lead to a risk of underreporting the real incidence of the primary outcome. However, the diagnostic standards were described in advance and based on objective results, and we assumed no different diagnostic criteria according to catheter type. Additionally, the risk of asymptomatic cases of DVT might have led to some underreporting of this event, but we considered this to be independent of catheter type. Thus, the risk of misclassification may have led to a general underreporting of the outcomes in both groups, introducing bias toward the null.

### Infection free midline catheter implementation at a community hospital (2 years) [^113fccV5]. American Journal of Infection Control (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

To reduce excess central line use and provide an option for difficult venous access patients through the introduction of a midline catheter.

Methods

Design included prospective monitoring of the implementation of a quality improvement project. The setting was a 576 bed, urban, community, nonprofit, Magnet recognized, level 3 trauma center serving primarily adult patients. Midline and peripherally inserted central catheters were inserted by a specialty nursing team; care and maintenance of all devices were provided by front line staff.

Results

Zero midline catheter infections were observed in the 24 months after implementation of the fixed length, power injectable device. Completion of therapy was 80%, the most frequently encountered complication was device dislodgement.

Conclusions

Adoption of a vascular access nurse led midline catheter program, coupled with device selection algorithms expanded the ability to select the right device for the patient, while decreasing excess central line usage without additional increased risks to the patient.

In a retrospective study conducted over 12 months in a multi-hospital system, the incidence of bloodstream infections associated with midline catheters was not significantly lower than that associated with central venous catheters (0.88 vs 1.10 infections per 1,000 catheter-days). Additional research is needed to further characterize the infectious risks of midline catheters and to determine optimal strategies to minimize these risks.

### The midline catheter: a clinical review [^113bGL9H]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Venous access in the emergency department (ED) is an often under-appreciated procedural skill given the frequency of its use. The patient's clinical status, ongoing need for laboratory investigation, and intravenous therapeutics guide the size, type, and placement of the catheter. The availability of trained personnel and dedicated teams using ultrasound-guided insertion techniques in technically difficult situations may also impact the selection. Appropriate device selection is warranted on initial patient contact to minimize risk and cost.

Objective

To compare venous access device indications and complications, highlighting the use of midline catheters as a potentially cost-effective and safe approach for venous access in the ED.

Discussion

Midline catheters (MC) offer a comparable rate of device-related bloodstream infection to standard peripheral intravenous catheters (PIV), but with a significantly lower rate than peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) and central venous catheters (CVC) (PIV 0.2/1000, MC 0.5/1000, PICC 2.1–2.3/1000, CVC 2.4–2.7/1000 catheter days). The average dwell time of a MC is reported as 7.69–16.4 days, which far exceeds PIVs (2.9–4.1 days) and is comparable to PICCs (7.3–16.6 days). Cost of insertion of a MC has been cited as comparable to three PIVs, and their use has been associated with significant cost savings when placed to avoid prolonged central venous access with CVCs or in patients with difficult-to-access peripheral veins. Placement of a MC includes modified Seldinger and accelerated, or all-in-one, Seldinger techniques with or without ultrasound guidance, with a high rate of first-attempt success.

Conclusion

The MC is a versatile venous access device with a low complication rate, long dwell time, and high rate of first-attempt placement. Its utilization in the ED in patients deemed to require prolonged hospitalization or to have difficult-to-access peripheral vasculature could reduce cost and risk to patients.

OPAT duration thresholds and extended midline use: The guideline defines a short OPAT course as less than 14 days and cites expert consensus recommending a MC for peripherally compatible infusates anticipated to last 14 or fewer days, with preferential use of a PICC for 15 or more days among hospitalized patients. When short courses are extended, limited data suggest safety beyond 2 weeks; in palliative home care without a comparator, MCs had a median dwell time of 85 days (range 1–365 days), premature removal occurred in 7.7% due to mechanical complications — obstruction 4.3% (N = 4), accidental dislodgement 2.2% (N = 2), catheter damage 1.1% (N = 1) — with no infectious complications, and exchanging a functioning MC for a PICC solely due to extension is not supported.

### Cost comparison of four venous catheters: short peripheral catheter, long peripheral line, midline, and PICC for peripheral infusion [^113knNAi]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The use of midline catheters for patients requiring a peripheral IV infusion is sometimes limited by their cost. Although decision trees allow them to be positioned in relation to short peripheral cannulas (SPC), Midlines, and PICCs, their economic impact has not yet been evaluated. A study was conducted to estimate and compare the actual costs of using the three types of catheters for durations of 7, 14, and 21days.

Methods

A budget impact analysis compared midlines or mini-midlines/long peripheral cannulas (LPCs) with SPCs and PICCs for typical medical indications excluding indications requiring central line (infusion of irritant or vesicant drugs): treatment of peritonitis over 7days, cystic fibrosis infection over 14days, and meningitis over 21days. A micro-costing study identified resources used during catheter care procedures (consumables, medical/nursing care, examinations, mechanical complications). The cost of remote systemic complications was estimated from the French national cost study. Literature review compared data based on published complication frequencies.

Results

Midline is more economic than the SPC (saving of 39€ over 7days and 174€ over 14days), and than the PICC (saving of 102€ over 14days and 95€ over 21days).

Discussion

Despite a much higher acquisition cost of the Midline than a SPC, the cost of using a Midline is lower. Although this approach cannot be the only argument for choosing a medical device, it can contribute to it in a tense economic context. The micro-costing has been performed in a center placing PICCline using fluoroscopy for catheter tip positioning. The implantation of a PICC with ECG technique does not require an interventional radiology facility and involves significantly lower logistical and personnel costs. This factor is a limitation in this study. However, even with the use of EGC, the cost difference is in favor of Midline.

### A 5-year experience with midline catheters in the management of major head and neck surgery patients [^116RTFu7]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

In the perioperative management of major head and neck surgery (HNS) patients, the performance of midline catheters (MCs) has been never tested. We present here our 5-year experience by reporting MC-related complications and by identifying the preoperative risk factors associated with their development.

Methods

Clinical variables were extracted and the dwell time, the number, and the type of postprocedural complications of MCs were retrieved. Complications were classified into major (needing MCs removal and including catheter-related bloodstream infection or deep vein thrombosis or catheter occlusion) and into minor (accidental dislodgement, leaking, etc.). Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were used in order to identify the predictors of complications.

Results

A total of 265 patients were included, with a mean age of 67.4years. Intraprocedural complications occurred in 1.1% of cases, while postprocedural complications occurred in 13.9% of cases (12.05/1000days), but they were minor in more than 7.0% (5.4/1000 catheter-days). There were 19 minor complications (7.1% or 5.4/1000 catheter-days) while 18 (7%, 5.1/1000 catheter-days) patients experienced at least one major complication. Female sex (OR = 1.963, 95% CI 1.017–3.792), insertion in the right arm (OR = 2.473, 95% CI 1.150–5.318), and an ACE-27 score > 1 (OR = 2.573, 95% CI 1.295–5.110) were independent predictors of major complications.

Conclusions

MCs appear to represent an effective option in the setting of major HNS. The identification of patients most at risk for MC-related complications should prompt a postoperative watchful evaluation.

### The safety of midline catheters for intravenous therapy at a large academic medical center [^117UCXV8]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: Midline catheters (MCs) have arisen as alternatives to peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) for both general intravenous therapy and extended outpatient parenteral therapy. However, there is a lack of data concerning the safety of medication therapy through midline for extended durations. Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of MCs for extended intravenous use. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study evaluating patients who received intravenous therapy through an MC at a tertiary care academic medical center. The primary end point was the incidence of composite catheter-related adverse events that included local events, catheter dislodgment, infiltration, catheter occlusion, catheter-related venous thromboembolism, extravasation, and line-associated infection. Results: A total of 82 MC placements and 50 PICC placements were included; 50 MCs were for outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy, and 32 were for inpatient intravenous use. There were 21 complications per 1000 catheter-days in the outpatient group and 7 complications per 1000 catheter-days in the PICC group (P = 0.91). The median time to complication in both groups was 8 days. The antimicrobial classes commonly associated with complications were cephalosporins, carbapenems, and penicillins. Conclusion and Relevance: Our results suggest that intravenous therapy with MCs is generally safe for prolonged courses that do not exceed 14 days as compared with PICC lines, which can be placed for months. There is still limited evidence for the use of MCs between 14 and 28 days of therapy. This study can help guide our selection of intravenous catheters for the purpose of outpatient antimicrobial therapy.

### Variation in use and outcomes related to midline catheters: results from a multicentre pilot study [^117YEvr9]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

As hospitals seek to improve appropriate use of PICCs to avoid adverse events such as DVT and financial penalties associated with CLABSI, interest in use of midline devices has emerged. Despite growing use of these devices, a paucity of epidemiological data regarding patterns of use and infectious and non-infectious outcomes exists. In this multihospital pilot study spanning twelve sites and 1161 midline insertions, we found that midlines were most often placed for the indications of difficult intravenous access and antibiotic therapy. Almost half of midlines placed were removed within 5 days of insertion after having met the indication they were placed for, with few of these shorter dwells (7%) removed for complications. Among patients who did experience a complication, minor complications were more common than major events. However, both types of complications often required midline removal, suggesting that minor complications are not inconsequential from a vascular access or patient perspective. Like prior work with PICCs, we found substantial variation in patterns of use and outcomes from midlines across hospitals. Collectively, these data suggest that guidance to inform and improve use of midlines is needed in order to ensure patient safety.

Although rates of complications with midlines were low, significant variation in both the nature and types of adverse events across hospitals was observed. Importantly, midlines appear to be more often associated with minor than major complications, with low rates of DVT and bloodstream infection noted across hospitals. These observations are congruent with recent studies and suggest that midlines might be a 'safer' alternative to PICCs with respect to these outcomes. Given their lower rate of potentially lethal events such as DVT and CLABSI, midlines appear to have an important place for hospitalised patients, especially for those who need short-term venous access. Compared with prior studies that found substantially greater rates of complications, our data suggest that the complication profile of midlines has improved perhaps due to newer catheter materials or ultrasound to guide insertion.

### Midline vs peripherally inserted central catheter for outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy [^115bqoWy]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In this large multihospital study, we found a lower risk of major complications in patients receiving OPAT through a midline catheter compared with a PICC. CRBSI was infrequent, and the incidence of CR-VTE was low among patients with midline catheters. Minor complications and device failure were similar among those that received midline catheters vs PICCs. The lower risk of major complications with midline catheters was more pronounced in devices that dwelled for 14 or fewer days. These findings have important implications in selecting a vascular access device for the millions of patients who receive OPAT today.

The low rates of CRBSI from midline catheters observed in our cohort has been reported in other studies. However, our findings related to the risk of midline catheter–related thrombosis differ from others. One systematic review that pooled results from single-site, retrospective studies reported a greater risk of thrombosis with midline catheters compared with PICCs. Prior analyses using data from multiple sites also suggested greater risk of thrombosis with midline catheters vs PICCs, particularly in patients requiring vascular access for short-term durations, and in patients who received vasopressors through midline catheters. However, a more recent meta-analysis found no difference in rates of catheter-related deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism between device types. To our knowledge, our study is the first to examine this aspect in a cohort of patients transitioning from inpatient to outpatient settings and specifically in those receiving antimicrobials. The low rates of CR-VTE observed in this study may relate to surveillance bias (limited testing in outpatients) or to reduction in risk from differing patient cohorts or less frequent device use as may occur during hospitalization.

### Variation in use and outcomes related to midline catheters: results from a multicentre pilot study [^113Ug1zS]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2019). High credibility.

Results

Complete data on 1161 midlines placed in 12 hospitals were available and included in this analysis. The available sample of midlines represented 5%–72% of all devices placed in these hospitals during the study period (table 1). Most midlines were placed in general ward settings (n = 822, 70.8%); however, 24.2% (n = 281) were placed in critical care units and 5.0% (n = 58) in 'other' settings (eg, emergency room). The majority of midlines were placed by vascular access nurses at the patients bedside (n = 1036, 89.2%). The documented indication for 61.4% of midlines (n = 713) was difficult intravenous access; however, intravenous antibiotics represented approximately one-third of all placement indications (n = 318, 27.4%). Consultation with infectious diseases for placement of midlines for intravenous antibiotics occurred for less than half of all midlines placed for this indication (46.2% [12.7% of all midlines]), suggesting a potential opportunity for device and antibiotic stewardship. Almost a quarter (23.9%, n = 278) of patients had more than one documented indication for midline placement, while the indication for midline insertion was unknown (ie, none documented in medical records or procedure notes) in 16.1% of cases.

### Midline catheters in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease [^1118bjM8]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Midline catheters (midlines) are increasingly used in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Objective

This study describes current practice and acute complications associated with midlines in CKD patients.

Designs, Setting, and Participants

Trained abstractors at 66 hospitals from the Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety (HMS) Consortium collected data on a sample of patients who received a midline during hospitalization. Patients were classified as having advanced CKD if their estimated glomerular filtration rate was < 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2.

Main Outcome and Measures

Midline recipients with advanced CKD were compared to those without advanced CKD by patient, provider, and device characteristics, and by the occurrence of acute complications including major (e.g., upper extremity deep vein thrombosis [UE-DVT] and catheter-related bloodstream infection [CRBSI]) or minor (e.g., catheter occlusion, catheter dislodgement, infiltration, superficial thrombophlebitis, and leaking at insertion site) events. Multivariable mixed effects logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between catheter-related complications and stage of CKD.

Results

Of 21,415 midline recipients, 5272 (24.6%) had advanced CKD, while 16,143 (75.4%) did not. Most midlines were single lumen (90.5%) and remained in place for a median of 6 days. A major or minor midline complication occurred in 804 (15.3%) patients with and 2239 (14.4%) patients without advanced CKD (adjusted odds ratios = 1.04; 95% confidence interval: 0.94–1.14). Among patients with advanced CKD, CRBSI occurred in 13 patients (0.2%) and UE-DVT occurred in 65 patients (1.2%). The proportion of advanced CKD among midline recipients and the frequency of midline-related complications varied across hospitals (interquartile range [IQR] = 19.2% to 29.8% [median = 25.0%] and IQR = 11.0%-18.9% [median = 15.4%], respectively).

### Safety and efficacy of midline vs peripherally inserted central catheters among adults receiving IV therapy: a randomized clinical trial [^113dhPoc]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

This RCT found no significant difference in CRBSI between MCs and PICCs. Both catheters were safe and demonstrated high efficacy. The incidence of catheter-related complications was higher in the MC group compared with the PICC control group. Despite this, our findings indicate that MCs could be considered an alternative to PICCs. Further cost-effectiveness studies comparing these devices are needed to balance between catheter efficacy and economic consequences.

### Safety and efficacy of midline vs peripherally inserted central catheters among adults receiving IV therapy: a randomized clinical trial [^111NgSXk]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is the use of midline catheters (MCs) a safe and more efficacious alternative to peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) for adult patients receiving medium- to long-term intravenous therapy?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial of 304 patients, rates of catheter-related bloodstream infection did not differ between the catheter groups. The MC group had a statistically significantly higher catheter-related complication rate, with an incidence rate ratio of 2.37 compared with the PICC control group.

Meaning

In this study, MCs and PICCs were both safe and efficacious, and despite the MC group having a higher complication rate, MCs could be an alternative to PICCs.

Implanted pain device infection — spinal cord stimulation (SCS) device epidemiology and presentation show that a multisite retrospective study involving 2737 implanted SCS devices identified SCS-related infection in 2.45% of cases (n = 67), with 2.27% occurring within the first year following implant, and the most common presenting signs and symptoms included pain (75.4%), erythema (63.1%), drainage (49.2%), swelling (30.8%), fever (26.2%), wound dehiscence (21.5%), and nausea (4.0%). The presentation of swelling, erythema, tenderness, erosion, or drainage at the site of an implanted device (at the IPG pocket, the tunneling site, or at the midline incision for anchoring) should raise concern for possible infection and prompt further investigation, and such infections are considered complicated and often require interdisciplinary management with infectious disease experts and possibly neurosurgeons or orthopedics surgeons.

### Variation in use and outcomes related to midline catheters: results from a multicentre pilot study [^116AmxV2]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2019). High credibility.

In conclusion, substantial variation in the rates of use and outcomes from midline catheters were observed in this multihospital study. Given lower risk of major complications, we suspect the use of midline catheters over PICCs will continue to expand. Studies to better define appropriate indications for use, optimal insertion technique, and best care and maintenance practices to ensure longevity of these devices are needed to ensure patient safety.

### Midline vs peripherally inserted central catheter for outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy [^111KkCjW]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

After accounting for dwell time and covariates, midline catheters placed for OPAT had a lower risk of major complications compared with PICCs (aHR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.23–0.91). However, no significant difference in CRBSI (aHR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.11–1.19) or CR-VTE (aHR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.26–1.59) were observed. When examining secondary outcomes, midline catheters were similar to PICCs with respect to minor complications (aHR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.83–1.38) and device failure (aHR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.96–1.65) (Table 3; Figure 2). In sensitivity analyses limited to patients whose discharge location was home, compared with PICCs, results were robust with regard to midline catheters' lower risk of major complications (aHR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.14–0.90) and similar risk of minor complications (aHR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.87–1.61). However, midline catheters were more often associated with device failure compared with PICCs among patients discharged to home (aHR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.04–2.06) (eTable 1 in Supplement 1).

### Safe administration of vancomycin through a novel midline catheter: a randomized, prospective clinical trial [^113vXP7P]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2014). Low credibility.

Results

There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to age, gender, administration of other antibiotics and average number of days on vancomycin. The average age of the PICC group was 69 years; the average age of the midline group was 72 years. Vancomycin was administered along with other antibiotics in 92% of the PICC group and in 93% of the midline group (Tab. I).

Table I
Sample Characteristics

A total of 54 patients were enrolled. There were no significant differences in the average or median catheter dwell-times. Twenty-nine patients received one or more midline, totaling 174 catheter-days, with an average midline dwell-time of 5.8 days (range = 1–12 days; median = 5 days). Twenty-five patients received one or more PICC, amounting to 176 catheter-days, with an average PICC dwell-time of 6.3 days (range = 1–25 days; median = 5 days).

There was no significant difference in total complications between the PICC and study device groups (Tab. II).

Table II
Catheter Performance

Total complications were 17.9% for patients with PICCs, including one (3.6%) "suspected BSI" — that is, fever without identified source, resolved with line removal — and four (14.2%) dislodgments. Thirty-two percent (32%) of PICC patients received intravenous vancomycin for greater than 5 days.

Total complications were 19.9% for patients with midlines, including one (3.3%) "leak" and two (6.6%) dislodgments. In addition, three (10.0%) Grade I infiltrations (INS Infiltration Scale) occurred in the midline group. The average age of the three patients with infiltrations was 91 years; the average dwell-time of the midline at the time of infiltration was 10 days. Twenty-nine percent (29%) of midline patients received intravenous vancomycin for greater than 5 days. There were no confirmed or suspected BSIs in the midline group.

Intravascular catheter-related infection definitions — catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), central line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), and midline catheter — are clarified as follows: Catheter-related bloodstream infection is a clinical definition requiring specific laboratory testing to identify the catheter as the source of bloodstream infection. Central line–associated BSI is defined as a primary bloodstream infection in a patient who had a central catheter within the 48-hour period before BSI development and that is not related to another infection site. A midline catheter is inserted via the antecubital fossa into the proximal basilic or cephalic veins and does not enter the central veins.

### Complications associated to midline-and long peripheral catheters in adults. systematic review of literature and proposal for a standardized model for data collection [^111Er3K7]. Thrombosis Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Long peripheral catheters (LPCs) and midline catheters (MCs) are indiscriminately labelled with different names, leading to misclassifications both in primary and secondary studies. The available studies used different methods to report the incidence of catheter-related complications, affecting the possibility of properly comparing the catheter outcomes. The aim of this review was to explore the complications related to LPCs and MCs after reclassifying according to their length.

Methods

Systematic literature review based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, conducted on PubMed, Scopus and CINAHL databases. The study protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. Data regarding LPCs and MCs were compared. Catheter outcomes were classified into major and minor complications, recomputed and reported as cases/1000 catheter-days.

Results

Fourteen studies were included. Over-half of the devices were correctly labelled by the authors, misclassifications affected particularly LPCs improperly labelled MCs. The cumulative incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections was 0.3 and 0.4/1000 catheter-days, that of symptomatic catheter-related thrombosis was 0.9 and 1.8/1000 catheter-days for MCs and LPCs, respectively. Minor complications and catheter failure were higher for LPCs.

Conclusions

A misclassification exists in the labelling of MCs and LPCs. A widespread heterogeneity of diagnostic criteria adopted to classify the catheters' outcomes was found, exposing the risk of misestimating the incidence of complications and undermining the possibility of effectively comparing results of the published research. We proposed a list of definitions and relevant variables as a first step toward the development of standardized criteria to be adopted for research purposes.

### Safe administration of vancomycin through a novel midline catheter: a randomized, prospective clinical trial [^1151gBSo]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The 2011 CDC Guidelines for the Prevention of Intravascular Catheter-Related Infections state, "Midline catheters are associated with lower rates of phlebitis than short peripheral catheters and with lower rates of infection than CVCs". As part of an evidence-based effort to reduce central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), in December 2011 the Vascular Access Team (VAT) at New York Hospital Queens began inserting a novel midline catheter (POWERWAND ®, Access Scientific, San Diego, CA), using the accelerated Seldinger technique. In the first year, performance of the device was excellent, with 93% of 906 midlines lasting through completion of therapy and zero bloodstream infections (BSIs).

Despite these excellent outcomes, patient selection was initially limited due to criteria established by the Infusion Nursing Society in the 2011 Standards of Practice. The Standards recommend that central lines, not midlines (a subcategory of peripheral catheters), be used for "infusates with pH less than 5 or greater than 9". Since vancomycin (pH 3.9) is the most commonly administered antibiotic at NYHQ for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Streptococcus aureus, large numbers of patients requiring intravenous vancomycin received peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) instead of midlines.

When a pharmacist questioned the Standards, noting that the pH of normal saline ranges from 4.5 to 7.0 (USP) and that erythromycin (pH 6.5–7.5) is far more phlebitogenic than vancomycin, the VAT decided to explore the topic further.

A detailed review of the 13 references cited in the Standards on the association of pH and thrombophlebitis revealed the following: Three of the references referred back to the Standards, five made no reference to pH whatsoever, one included no references and no data and four addressed pH only in connection with parenteral nutritional infusates. One of the self-referring articles did contain a 1968 internal reference to buffering 5% dextrose solutions in order to reduce phlebitis. However, not one article or internal reference addressed the pH of any medication as the sole and only cause of phlebitis.

### Safe administration of vancomycin through a novel midline catheter: a randomized, prospective clinical trial [^116LUXri]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2014). Low credibility.

Background

According to the 2011 Infusion Nursing Standards of Practice, the low pH of intravenous vancomycin requires that it be administered through a central line. However, a careful review of the literature and a retrospective analysis of the experience at New York Hospital Queens (NYHQ) did not support the position of the Standards.

Purpose

A prospective, controlled, randomized clinical trial was conducted to determine if intravenous vancomycin could be safely administered through a novel midline catheter (POWERWAND®, Access Scientific, San Diego, CA).

Methods

Patients scheduled to receive short-term (< 6 days) intravenous vancomycin were randomly assigned to receive treatment through either a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) or the midline study device. Complications and the costs of insertion were recorded.

Results

The two groups did not differ significantly with respect to total complications (17.9% with PICCs vs. 19.9% with the midline), phlebitis (0% vs. 0%) or thrombosis (0% vs. 0%). One suspected catheter-associated bloodstream infection did occur in the PICC group. Insertion costs were $90.00 less per insertion in the midline group.

Conclusions

Short-term intravenous vancomycin can be safely and cost-efficiently administered in the deep vessels of the upper arm using the midline study device.

### Complications of pediatric midline catheters: a prospective observational pilot study [^114YmbBq]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Midline catheters are peripheral intravenous (IV) catheters in which the tip of the catheter does not reach the central circulation. In children, the use of midline catheters could lead to decreased complications from central venous catheters. To validate the safety of midline catheter use in children, we aimed to describe the complications and dwell time of pediatric midline catheters. The primary outcome was the incidence of catheter-related venous thromboembolism (VTE).

Methods

We conducted an observational, prospective study including consecutive patients at a tertiary multidisciplinary pediatric hospital. One hundred pediatric midline catheters were followed for thrombotic, infectious, and mechanical complications. After catheter removal, Doppler ultrasonography was performed to detect asymptomatic VTE.

Results

The mean age was 6.0 years (standard deviation [SD], 4.7), and median catheter dwell time was 6 (4–8) days. Most midline catheters were inserted in arm veins, most commonly in the basilic vein (56%). Catheter-related VTE was diagnosed in 30 (30%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 21%-40%) cases, corresponding to an incidence rate of 39 (95% CI, 26–55) cases per 1000 catheter days. Eight of 14 saphenous vein catheters were complicated by VTE compared to 22 of 86 arm vein catheters, suggesting an imbalance in favor of arm vein insertion site. Two patients needed anticoagulation therapy due to catheter-related VTE. Thirty (30%) catheters were removed unintentionally or due to complications, 22 of these needed additional IV access to complete the intended therapy. No catheter-related bloodstream infection (95% CI, 0%-4%) occurred. Mechanical complications occurred in 33 (33%; 95% CI, 24%-43%) midline catheters.

Conclusions

In children, thrombotic and mechanical complications of midline catheters are common, but only few VTEs are severe enough to warrant anticoagulation therapy. Systemic infectious complications are rare. Seventy-eight percent of patients did not need additional venous access to complete short-term IV therapy. Considering the rate of clinically relevant complications and the catheter dwell time, pediatric midline catheters could be an alternative to central venous access for short-term (5–10 days) IV therapy.

### Variation in use and outcomes related to midline catheters: results from a multicentre pilot study [^1168ApRx]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2019). High credibility.

Despite these assurances, when and how midlines should be used to minimise risk and ensure benefit remain an important question. The Michigan Appropriateness Guide for Intravenous Catheters (MAGIC) provides criteria for when use of a midline versus a PICC is appropriate for hospitalised and critically ill patients and patients with cancer. Additionally, MAGIC provides guidance on what types of infusions are appropriate for a midline device — a key component of mitigating harm from these devices. As has been the case with PICCs, using MAGIC as a framework to understand and improve midline appropriateness and patient outcomes may be valuable in improving patient safety.

We observed that most midlines were placed for the indication of difficult venous access, suggesting that hospitals are turning to this device when attempts to cannulate peripheral veins fail. As midlines are longer in length, placed under sterile conditions and usually placed by ultrasound, they reach the deeper veins of the arm to secure more durable access. However, variation in indication for placement and rates of midline dwell were observed across hospitals. Thus, how best to use, insert and maintain midlines to ensure catheter dwell matches clinical need remains an important outstanding question. Studies that focus on insertion parameters related to midlines, including use of ultrasound, length of catheter within the vein and catheter-to-vein ratio, are thus needed as they may help prolong dwell. Similarly, identifying optimal care and maintenance techniques including what should be adminstered via a peripheral device such as a midline, volume, type and frequency of flush and optimal securement strategies to prevent dislodgement also appear necessary. These considerations represent important questions for future research and are needed to fully realise the potential of these devices.

### Safety of vancomycin use through midline catheters for outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy [^112E8Q5f]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Results

Among 3317 patients prescribed OPAT through midline catheters, the median (IQR) age was 67.5 (56.1–77.6) years; 1678 (51.5) were male and 1639 (49.4%) were female. A total of 597 (18.0%) received vancomycin, whereas 2720 (82.0%) did not. OPAT duration (median [IQR], 11 [7–17] vs 11 [7–16] days; p = 0.33), catheter dwell time (median [IQR], 12.0 [8.0–19.0] vs 12.0 [8.0–17.0] days; p = 0.14), and consultation with infectious diseases (ID) specialists (84.9% vs 82.8%; p = 0.22) were similar between both groups.

Major device complications occurred in 49 (1.5%) of 3317 patients in the overall cohort, including 27 (4.5%) of 597 vancomycin recipients vs 22 (0.8%) of 2720 nonrecipients (P < .001). Vancomycin recipients had higher rates of CRBSI (2.5% vs 0.3%; P < .001) and CR-VTE (2.0% vs 0.6%; P < .001) than nonrecipients. Device failure was more prevalent among vancomycin recipients than nonrecipients (16.9% vs 9.6%; P < .001). In adjusted analyses, vancomycin administration through a midline catheter was associated with a higher hazard of major device complications (aHR, 4.82; 95% CI, 2.64–8.83) and device failure (aHR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.36–2.25; Table; Figure). Vancomycin was also associated with higher risks of CRBSI (aHR, 8.00; 95% CI, 2.96–21.63) and CR-VTE (aHR, 3.30; 95% CI, 1.52–7.16). Results were robust to sensitivity analyses, including patients discharged home (vs facility) and patients who received vancomycin monotherapy.

### Variation in use and outcomes related to midline catheters: results from a multicentre pilot study [^115ZNBxY]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2019). High credibility.

Background

While midline vascular catheters are gaining popularity in clinical practice, patterns of use and outcomes related to these devices are not well known.

Methods

Trained abstractors collected data from medical records of hospitalised patients who received midline catheters in 12 hospitals. Device characteristics, patterns of use and outcomes were assessed at device removal or at 30days. Rates of major (upper-extremity deep vein thrombosis [DVT], bloodstream infection [BSI] and catheter occlusion) and minor complications were assessed. χ 2 tests were used to examine differences in rates of complication by number of lumens, reasons for catheter removal l, and hospital-level differences in rates of midline use.

Results

Complete data on 1161 midlines representing 5%-72% of all midlines placed in participating hospitals between 1 January 2017 and 1 March 2018 were available. Most (70.8%) midlines were placed in general ward settings for difficult intravenous access (61.4%). The median dwell time of midlines across hospitals was 6 days; almost half (49%) were removed within 5 days of insertion. A major or minor complication occurred in 10.3% of midlines, with minor complications such as dislodgement, leaking and infiltration accounting for 71% of all adverse events. While rates of major complications including occlusion, upper-extremity DVT and BSI were low (2.2%, 1.4% and 0.3%, respectively), they were just as likely to lead to midline removal as minor complications (53.8% vs 52.5%, p = 0.90). Across hospitals, absolute volume of midlines placed varied from 100 to 1837 devices, with corresponding utilisation rates of 0.97%-12.92% (p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Midline use and outcomes vary widely across hospitals. Although rates of major complications are low, device removal as a result of adverse events is common.

### Strategies to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^112T1ykF]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Section 1: Rationale and statements of concern

Burden of outcomes associated with hospital-acquired CLABSI

Increased length of hospital stay –
Increased cost. The adjusted variable costs for patients with CLABSI were $32,000 (2010 US dollars) higher on average than for patients without CLABSI
Increased morbidity and mortality

Risk factors for CLABSI

Patients at risk for CLABSI in acute-care facilities are those with a CVC in place: Intensive care unit (ICU) population: The risk of CLABSI in ICU patients is high. Reasons for this include the frequent insertion of multiple catheters; the use of specific types of catheters that are almost exclusively inserted in ICU patients and associated with substantial risk (eg, pulmonary artery catheters with catheter introducers); and the fact that catheters are frequently placed in emergency circumstances, repeatedly accessed each day, and often needed for extended periods. Non-ICU population: Although the primary focus of attention over the last 20 years has been the ICU setting, most CLABSIs occur in hospital units outside the ICU or in outpatients. –
Infection prevention and control efforts should include other vulnerable populations such as patients receiving hemodialysis through catheters, intraoperative patients, and oncology patients.
In addition to CVCs, short-term peripheral catheters, peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs), midline catheters, and peripheral arterial catheters also carry a risk of infection.
Independent risk factors for CLABSI (in at least 2 published studies) – Prolonged hospitalization before catheterization Prolonged duration of catheterization Heavy microbial colonization at insertion site Heavy microbial colonization of the catheter hub Multilumen catheters Concurrent catheters Neutropenia Body mass index (BMI) > 40 Prematurity (ie, early gestational age) Reduced nurse-to-patient ratio in the ICU Parenteral nutrition Substandard catheter care (eg, excessive manipulation of the catheter) Transfusion of blood products (in children)

### Safety and efficacy of midline vs peripherally inserted central catheters among adults receiving IV therapy: a randomized clinical trial [^1118M8uA]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

We found that 13.2% of patients with MCs and 7.2% of patients with PICCs had catheter-related complications. The absolute incidence of MC complications was low compared with other findings in the literature, with rates ranging from 15% to as high as 38%. In a recent systematic review, where all different types of MCs in different lengths were pooled in the analysis, the all-cause complication rate was 12.5% (95% CI, 11.9%-13.2%). This review primarily consisted of cohort studies, with only a few smaller RCTs included, and not all studies had a comparator. As a result, not all types of complications were consistently reported, leading to potential underreporting of all-cause complication rates. Another study found that when the catheter-to-vein ratio exceeds 45%, the risk of complications increases. In our insertion procedures, we did not routinely assess vein diameter or adapt catheter thickness accordingly. This highlights the need to select the right catheter for the patient, considering the anticipated treatment duration and type of IV therapy to avoid multiple insertions and secure catheter patency throughout the entire treatment period.

In the PICC control group, catheter tip placement was routinely verified with postprocedure radiographs. However, this practice was not applied to the MC group. While the use of ultrasonography guidance to optimize the MC tip location has been demonstrated as feasible, its effect on reducing complications remains uncertain.

Familiarity with use of MCs and PICCs might also be important. In a feasibility study involving a pediatric population, introduction of a new MC was compared with a PICC-based algorithm. In this study, 19% of the clinicians had used the MCs fewer than 6 times prior to study initiation. Consequently, more complications with use of MCs were observed at the beginning of the study, which highlights the potential impact of a varied learning curve when introducing a new device into routine health care. To address this issue, we ensured that the vascular access team had the appropriate level of experience before the study initiation. This proactive approach may have contributed to the low rate of complications observed with both catheters in this study. By prioritizing comprehensive training and expertise in the vascular access team and among the nurses on the wards and in the home care institutions, we sought to create a foundation for successful catheter use, thereby optimizing patient safety. Continuous education and ongoing support for health care professionals are important to maintaining high standards of care and achieving optimal patient outcomes.

This study sought to determine the incidence and characteristics of midline-associated bloodstream infections (MABSI) at an urban health system during the COVID-19 pandemic. A MABSI rate similar to the central line-associated bloodstream infection rate was found. A large number of MABSI were caused by Staphylococcus spp and Enterococcus spp, as has previously been reported for central line-associated bloodstream infection. Patients with MABSI had high in-hospital mortality rates.

### Safety and outcomes of midline catheters vs peripherally inserted central catheters for patients with short-term indications: a multicenter study [^1137fMjN]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) and midlines are frequently used for short-term venous access; whether one is safer than the other in this setting has not been adequately reported.

Objective

To compare outcomes between patients who had a PICC vs midline placed for the indication of difficult vascular access or antibiotic therapy for 30 or fewer days.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study analyzed data from a multihospital registry including patients admitted to a participating site from December 2017 through January 2020 who had a PICC or midline placement for the indications of difficult venous access or intravenous antibiotic therapy prescribed for 30 or fewer days. Data were analyzed from October 2020 to March 2021.

Exposures

PICC and midline placement.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Major complications, including a composite of symptomatic catheter-associated deep vein thrombosis (DVT), catheter-related bloodstream infection, and catheter occlusion. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression models (taking into account catheter dwell) were used to estimate risk for major complications, adjusting for patient and device characteristics and the clustered nature of the data. Sensitivity analyses limiting analyses to 10 days of device dwell were performed.

Results

Data on 10 863 patients, 5758 with PICCs and 5105 with midlines (median [IQR] age of device recipients, 64.8 [53.4–75.4] years; 5741 [52.8%] were female), were included. After adjusting for patient characteristics, comorbidities, catheter lumens, and dwell time in logit models, patients who received PICCs had a greater risk of developing a major complication compared with those who received midlines (odds ratio, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.61–2.47). Reduction in complications stemmed from lower rates of occlusion (2.1% vs 7.0%; P < .001) and bloodstream infection (0.4% vs 1.6%; P < .001) in midlines vs PICCs; no significant difference in the risk of DVT between PICCs and midlines was observed. In time-to-event models, similar outcomes for bloodstream infection and catheter occlusion were noted; however, the risk of DVT events was lower in patients who received PICCs vs midlines (hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.38–0.74). Results were robust to sensitivity analyses.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study among patients with placement of midline catheters vs PICCs for short-term indications, midlines were associated with a lower risk of bloodstream infection and occlusion compared with PICCs. Whether DVT risk is similar or greater with midlines compared with PICCs for short-term use is unclear. Randomized clinical trials comparing these devices for this indication are needed.

At insertion

In ICU and non-ICU settings, a facility should have a process in place, such as a checklist, to ensure adherence to infection prevention practices at the time of CVC insertion (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) Ensure and document adherence to aseptic technique Checklists have been suggested to ensure optimal insertion practices. If used, the documentation should be done by someone other than the inserter. Observation of CVC insertion should be done by a nurse, physician, or other HCP who has received appropriate education (see above) to ensure that aseptic technique is maintained. HCP should be empowered to stop the procedure if breaches in aseptic technique are observed.
Perform hand hygiene prior to catheter insertion or manipulation (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) – Use an alcohol-based waterless product or soap and water. Use of gloves does not obviate hand hygiene.
The subclavian site is preferred to reduce infectious complications when the catheter is placed in the ICU setting (Quality of Evidence: HIGH),– In the non-ICU setting, the risk of infection between the different sites remains unclear. Importantly, in emergent settings, ensuring life-saving vascular access in the fastest possible way may determine the choice of access site. In children and infants, femoral vein catheterization may be considered if upper body sites are contraindicated. Tunneled femoral vein catheters, with an exit site outside the diaper area in the mid-thigh, may be safer and provide additional risk reduction. Controversy exists regarding infectious and noninfectious complications associated with different short-term CVC access sites. The risk and benefit of different insertion sites must be considered on an individual basis with regard to infectious and noninfectious complications. Among others, this applies to patients currently receiving or likely to require hemodialysis in whom the subclavian site is avoided due to risk of stenosis. Do not use peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs) as a strategy to reduce the risk of CLABSI. Risk of infection with PICCs in hospitalized patients approaches that of other CVCs. However, the majority of CLABSIs due to PICCs occur in non-ICU settings. Midline catheters are increasingly being used as an alternative to CVCs for short-term vascular access, with some observational studies suggesting lower bloodstream infection risk associated with midline catheters versus PICCsand versus CVCs, respectively. Randomized controlled trials comparing the risk of bloodstream infections and other complications associated with these devices are needed.
Use an all-inclusive catheter cart or kit (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) A catheter cart or kit that contains all necessary components for aseptic catheter insertion should be available and easily accessible in all units where CVCs are inserted.
Use ultrasound guidance for catheter insertion (Quality of Evidence: HIGH), Ultrasound-guided internal jugular and femoral vein catheterization reduces the risk of noninfectious complications associated with CVC placementbut the use of ultrasound may lead to a breach in aseptic technique. It is unclear whether ultrasound-guided subclavian vein insertion reduces risk of infectious complications.
Use maximum sterile barrier precautions during CVC insertion (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) – Use maximum sterile barrier precautions: A mask, cap, sterile gown, and sterile gloves are to be worn by all HCP involved in the catheter insertion procedure. The patient is to be covered with a large ("full-body") sterile drape during catheter insertion. These measures should also be followed when exchanging a catheter over a guidewire. A prospective, randomized study in surgical patients showed no additional benefit for maximum sterile barrier precautions; nevertheless, most available evidence suggests risk reduction with this intervention.
Use an alcoholic chlorhexidine antiseptic for skin preparation (Quality of Evidence: HIGH),– Before catheter insertion, apply an alcoholic chlorhexidine solution containing at least 2% chlorhexidine gluconate to the insertion site. The antiseptic solution must be allowed to dry before making the skin puncture. Alcoholic chlorhexidine for skin antisepsis to prevent CLABSI in NICU patients should be used when the benefits are judged to outweigh potential risk.

### Variation in use and outcomes related to midline catheters: results from a multicentre pilot study [^112UCGEb]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2019). High credibility.

Our study has limitations. First, we collected data from the electronic medical records of hospitalised patients via trained data abstractors; data or events that were not documented or occurred after hospitalisation and were not reported by patients during phone conversations may be missed using this method. Second, we sampled patients at hospitals in order to understand patterns and outcome of midline use. Differences between our study sample and those from the larger population of patients who received midlines may affect our findings. Third, while we did not find an association between hospital-level and patient-level factors related to midline use or outcome, it is possible that we were underpowered for this effect given the pilot nature of this study. Fourth, complications with midlines (including major complications such as infection and DVT) may be under-reported or under-recognised as these are peripheral intravenous devices. Furthermore, variability in DVT rates between hospitals may also reflect variability in diagnostic testing thresholds, which we were unable to assess. However, our use of medical record documentation (including laboratory and imaging data) rather than administratively coded data helps to mitigate this risk. Finally, outcomes from midlines may vary based on materials, catheter design, insertion techniques, and infusates which we did not collect in this pilot study. Future iterations of this work will seek to incorporate these aspects.

Our study also has important strengths. To our knowledge, this is the first and largest multihospital study to date to examine indications, patterns of use and outcomes for midline catheters. As use of these devices expands, understanding best practices through epidemiological studies such as ours will become more necessary. Second, we report several new findings including the fact that the number of midline lumens appears associated with the rates of complications. These findings have important implications for clinical decision-making and patient safety. Third, substantial variation in hospital event rates related to midline devices appears to exist. Using a conceptual framework of patient, provider and device factors to understand complications thus appears to be just as important for midlines as it was for PICCs. Future studies should now begin to examine these factors and consider strategies through which to prolong midline dwell so as to ensure best outcomes.

### Variation in use and outcomes related to midline catheters: results from a multicentre pilot study [^1129ijCn]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

First introduced in the 1950s, midline catheters are unique vascular access devices often referred to as 'middle ground' intravenous catheters. Like peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs), midlines are inserted in the peripheral veins of the upper extremity; however, unlike PICCs, midlines terminate in the peripheral, not the central veins. By definition, the tip of the midline catheter should be located at or near the level of the axilla, distal to the shoulder. Because they are not central venous catheters, midlines cannot lead to central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), resulting in many hospitals preferentially using to these devices to avoid CLABSI and associated financial penalties. Additionally, as midlines are longer than traditional peripheral intravenous catheters and reach the deeper veins of the arm, they are potentially able to dwell longer than standard peripheral intravenous catheters. For these reasons, they offer a convenient alternative to PICCs for certain indications.

With growing reports regarding overuse of PICCs and the risk of potentially avoidable complications, renewed interest in the use of midlines has emerged. However, midline devices are not homogeneous. Rather, they vary in composition (eg, polyurethane vs silicone), configuration (single vs dual lumen), gauge (4 and 5 French) and insertion technique. Consequently, substantial variation regarding safety and outcomes of midlines exists. For example, in a single-centre retrospective study spanning 1538 midlines, dwell times ranged from 12 to 27 days (median 26) and occlusion was a common complication (1.44 events per 1000 midline days). In another study comparing outcomes between PICCs and midlines, patients who received midlines were observed to experience more complications than those with PICCs (19.5% vs 5.8%, p < 0.001), with no difference in rates of severe complications. In contrast, a third quasi-experimental study found that introduction of appropriateness criteria to guide the selection of midlines versus PICCs led to a reduction in hospital PICC use, rates of upper-extremity thrombosis and catheter occlusion with no major adverse events from midlines. Importantly, these studies all represent single-centre experiences. Little is known about real-world use and variation of outcomes related to midlines within and across hospitals. Given this gap, we conducted a pilot study to examine use, variation and outcomes related to midline catheters in hospitals across the state of Michigan.

Replacement of central venous catheters (CVCs) — evidence summary indicates that routine scheduled replacement does not lower CRBSI and clarifies circumstances for guide wire exchange and dialysis access. Midline catheters were in place for a median of 7 days, but for as long as 49 days. Two trials assessed changing a catheter every 7 days versus as needed, including one with 112 surgical ICU patients and another with only subclavian hemodialysis catheters, and in both studies no difference in CRBSI was observed between scheduled every‑7‑day replacement and as‑needed replacement. A metaanalysis of 12 randomized, controlled trials failed to demonstrate any reduction of CRBSI rates through routine replacement of CVCs by guide wire exchange compared with as‑needed replacement, and routine replacement of CVCs is not necessary for catheters that are functioning without evidence of causing local or systemic complications. Exchange of temporary catheters over a guide wire in the presence of bacteremia is not an acceptable replacement strategy, whereas in selected patients with tunneled hemodialysis catheters and bacteremia, exchange over a guide wire with antibiotic therapy is an alternative as a salvage strategy in patients with limited venous access. If temporary access is needed for dialysis, a tunneled cuffed catheter is preferable to a nontunneled catheter, even in the ICU setting, if the catheter is expected to stay in place for more than 3 weeks.

Methods

We used data from hospitalized patients who received midline catheters between January 2017 and August 2024. We excluded patients who received their device in critical care settings and included patients who received antimicrobials through a midline catheter after hospital discharge. Patients were followed up until device removal, death, or 30 days from device insertion. This study was classified as not regulated by University of Michigan's Institutional Review Board; informed consent was waived because all data were deidentified. This study followed thereporting guideline.

The primary outcome was a major device complication, including catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) and catheter-related venous thromboembolism (CR-VTE). Secondary outcomes included device failure, defined as premature removal of midline catheter due to any complication as described. We assessed associations between receipt of vancomycin and outcomes using Fine-Gray hazards models, accounting for dwell time and risk of competing event of device removal from other device complications, adjusting for patient and device characteristics. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) with 95% CIs were calculated using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute). All tests were 2-tailed, and P < .05 was considered statistically significant (eMethods in Supplement 1).

Category IA
- Use a midline catheter or peripherally inserted central catheter, instead of a short peripheral catheter, when the duration of IV therapy will likely exceed six days. Category II
- Evaluate the catheter insertion site daily by palpation through the dressing to discern tenderness and by inspection if a transparent dressing is in use. Gauze and opaque dressings should not be removed if the patient has no clinical signs of infection. If the patient has local tenderness or other signs of possible CRBSI, an opaque dressing should be removed and the site inspected visually. Background The site at which a catheter is placed influences the subsequent risk for catheter-related infection and phlebitis. The influence of site on the risk for catheter infections is related in part to the risk for thrombophlebitis and density of local skin flora. The density of skin flora at the catheter insertion site is a major risk factor for CRBSI.

No single trial has satisfactorily compared infection rates for catheters placed in jugular, subclavian, and femoral veins. In retrospective observational studies, catheters inserted into an internal jugular vein have usually been associated with higher risk for colonization and/or CRBSI than those inserted into a subclavian. Similar findings were noted in neonates in a single retrospective study. Femoral catheters have been demonstrated to have high colonization rates compared with subclavian and internal jugular sites when used in adults and, in some studies, higher rates of CLABSIs. Catheters should be inserted as great a distance as possible from open wounds. In one study, catheters inserted close to open burn wounds were 1. 79 times more likely to be colonized and
5. 12 times more likely to be associated with bacteremia than catheters inserted farther from the wounds.

The MSB group had fewer episodes of both catheter colonization and CR-BSI. In addition, the group using MSB precautions had infections that occurred much later and contained gram negative, rather than gram positive, organisms.

### Midline vs peripherally inserted central catheter for outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy [^114ChkjS]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize patient and device data. Patients that received midline catheters vs PICCs were compared across patient, clinician, and device characteristics, using χ 2 or Wilcoxon tests for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. The association between outcomes and type of device (midline catheter vs PICC) were assessed using a Cox proportional hazards model, accounting for catheter dwell time. Models were adjusted for patient age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index score, history of venous thromboembolism, history of CLABSI, active malignant neoplasm, receipt of anticoagulants, presence of another central vein catheter, number of catheter lumens, and catheter size. Random-effects models were used to account for hospital-level variation. As current practice guidelines endorse midline catheter use for 14 or fewer days and there are very limited data to suggest that midline catheters are safe beyond this period, we stratified our assessment of the association by dwell time, using 14 days as the cutoff. We also performed sensitivity analyses limited to patients whose discharge location was home (instead of a postacute care facility).

Results were expressed as adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) with 95% CIs. All tests were 2-tailed, and P < .05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed in SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute).

OPAT midline catheter vs PICC — comparative safety evidence: Four studies compared complications of midline catheters (MCs) vs peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) in OPAT-relevant populations, with mixed findings; one study reported higher composite adverse events with MCs (19.5% vs 5.8%, OR 3.90, 95% CI 1.92–8.48, P < .001), while two studies showed no significant difference (19.9% vs 17.9%, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.35–2.89, P = 1.0; and 14 vs 11 per 1000 VAD days, IRR 1.18, 0.62–2.22, P = 0.62). Major events included deep venous thrombosis (DVT), with more DVTs in MCs in one study (5.96% vs 0.0%), no line infections in another, and no difference in major complications in two studies (9.0% vs 4.9%, OR 1.94, 95% CI 0.87–4.47, P = 0.12; 0.0% vs 0%). Minor complications were higher with MCs in one study (11.5% vs 1.5%, OR 8.76, 95% CI 2.84–37.21, P < .001) but not in another (19.9% vs 17.9%, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.35–2.89, P = 1.0), and overall the guideline states evidence is insufficient to determine relative safety of MCs vs PICCs.

### Midline vs peripherally inserted central catheter for outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy [^1173zBRf]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are midline catheters associated with similar or lower risk of major device complications compared with peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) in patients receiving outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT)?

Findings

In this cohort study that included 2824 vascular access devices placed for OPAT, the risk of major device complications was lower with midline catheters compared with PICCs, particularly for devices that dwelled for 14 or fewer days.

Meaning

These findings suggest that midline catheters are safe alternatives to PICCs for OPAT, especially for treatment durations of 14 or fewer days.

### Midline catheters: a 3-year experience at a veterans administration medical center [^1134AtYC]. American Journal of Infection Control (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Midline catheters are recommended over peripherally inserted central catheters as short-term vascular access device for peripherally compatible infusates. We assessed the effectiveness and safety of midline catheters.

Methods

Data from midline catheter placements from June 2016 to May 2019 at a tertiary-care Veterans Administration medical center were retrospectively collected. Patients were followed until catheter removal or death, whichever occurred first. The primary outcome was completion of intended therapy; secondary outcomes were catheter-related complications, including major (eg, catheter-related bloodstream infections [CRBSI] or venous thromboembolism [VTE]) and minor (eg, catheter occlusion, kinking, dislodgement) events.

Results

Of 115 midlines, 62 (53.9%) were for antibiotic infusion and 49 (32.6%) for difficult access. The median dwell time was 11 days (interquartile range, 5.5–19.5 days). Midline catheters lasted through completion of therapy in 93 patients (80.9%). Catheter-related complications occurred in 27 patients (23.5%), including catheter dislodgement in 10 patients (8.7%), catheter kinking in 8 (7.0%), and catheter occlusion in 3 (2.6%). Only 1 patient experienced a major complication, a deep venous thrombosis (0.9%).

Conclusions

Midlines appear to be effective and safe for short-term vascular access in patients requiring peripherally compatible infusates. While the rate of major complications is low, minor complications that necessitate device removal are common.

### Midline vs peripherally inserted central catheter for outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy [^112yH4dU]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

When stratified by dwell time, we found that patients with midline catheters in place for 14 or fewer days had significantly lower risk of major complications, particularly CR-VTE, vs PICCs. Further, during this short duration of midline catheter use, the risks of minor complications and device failure were similar to PICCs. For dwell exceeding 14 days, the likelihood of any major complication occurring with midline catheters was similar to those with PICCs. The rates of minor complications and device failure were also comparable in both devices beyond 14 days. Collectively, these findings support current practice that prefer midline catheters over PICCs for peripherally compatible infusates if the intended use is 14 or fewer days. However, these findings also suggest that midline catheters may also be considered for dwell times beyond 14 days. Future studies evaluating factors such as specific infusates, varying care practices, and device placement techniques or properties that support longer midline catheter dwell would be welcomed.,

Minor complications often necessitate device removal or replacement, interrupting OPAT and causing patient discomfort or inconvenience. Consistent with previous reports, we found minor complications to be common with both midline catheters and PICCs. The most common midline catheter complication was catheter dislodgement, which in many cases necessitated device removal. Catheter occlusion was also common with midline catheters and generally led to premature midline catheter removal, as little evidence examining the use of thrombolytics to declot midline catheters is available. In contrast, catheter occlusion of PICCs is often remediable with thrombolytics and may not necessitate device removal. Studies examining the safety and efficacy of the use of these agents in midline catheters appear necessary.

### Promoting appropriate midline catheter and PICC placement through implementation of an EHR-based clinical decision support tool: an interrupted time-series analysis [^117MP136]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Inappropriate use of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs), including multilumen PICCs, may increase the risk of patient complications.

Objective

Implement computerized decision support to: (a) increase the use of midline catheters over PICCs when appropriate and (b) decrease PICC lumens when a PICC is necessary.

Designs

Quasi-experimental, interrupted time series.

Setting

Single tertiary academic medical center.

Patients

Hospitalized adults who received a midline or PICC during clinical care.

Intervention

Decision support on appropriate vascular access device choice via a set of electronic orders embedded within the electronic health record.

Measurements

Proportion of midline catheter and single-lumen PICCs placed between January 2, 2017 and November 19, 2017 (preintervention) versus November 20, 2017 to December 1, 2019 (postintervention).

Results

A total of 8758 midline and PICCs were inserted during the study period. A statistically significant increase in the insertion of midline catheters was observed during the intervention (p = .006). In parallel, single-lumen PICC insertion as a proportion of all PICCs also increased after the intervention (p = .035). Results were consistent across multiple disciplines, including internal medicine, surgery, and intensive care. After considering the hospital census, total PICC and midline utilization rates and rates of complications did not change over time. However, an increase in catheter exchanges from less to more invasive devices occurred.

Conclusions

In this single-center study, the implementation of electronic decision support to inform appropriate catheter use led to a more appropriate midline catheter and single-lumen PICC insertion. Dissemination of this single, effective intervention to examine efficacy in other hospital settings would be welcomed.

### The longer the catheter, the lower the risk of complications: results of the HERITAGE study comparing long peripheral and midline catheters [^112GtAMV]. American Journal of Infection Control (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Although widely used in clinical practice, long peripheral (LPCs) and midline catheters (MCs) are often misclassified because of their similar characteristics. Comparative studies on these devices are lacking. This study aimed to explore complications risks in polyurethane LPCs and MCs.

Methods

Prospective cohort study. Catheter-failure within 30days was the primary outcome, catheter-related bloodstream infection (CR-BSI), thrombosis, and fibroblastic sleeve were secondary outcomes. The average number of drugs infused per day was computed to measure the overall intensity of catheters' use.

Results

The catheter-failure incidence was 5.7 and 3.4/1,000 catheter-days for LPCs and MCs, respectively. MCs were associated with an adjusted lower risk of catheter-failure (hazard ratio 0.311, 95% confidence interval 0.106–0.917, P = 0.034). The daily number of drugs infused was higher for MCs (P < .001) and was associated with a greater risk catheter-failure risk (P = 0.021). Sensitivity analysis showed a decreased catheter-failure risk for MCs starting from day-10 from positioning. The incidence of CR-BSI (0.9 vs 0.0/1,000 catheter-days), thrombosis (8.7 vs 3.5/1,000 catheter-days), and fibroblastic sleeve (14.0 vs 8.1/1,000 catheters-days) was higher for LPC catheters.

Conclusions

Despite more intensive drug administration, MCs were associated with a longer uncomplicated indwelling time.

### Variation in use and outcomes related to midline catheters: results from a multicentre pilot study [^115q8tU1]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2019). High credibility.

Table 1
Pilot hospital characteristics and midline utilisation data, January 2017–March 2018

The right arm was more often used for midline placement (n = 597, 51.4%). The basilic (n = 487, 42.0%) and brachial (n = 469, 40.4%) veins were most commonly used for insertion. Single-lumen devices represented almost half of all midlines (46.0%). Ultrasound guidance was documented for placement in 80.6% of midline devices.

The median dwell time of midlines across hospitals was 6 days (IQR: 3–12 days), with almost half (n = 569, 49.0%) removed within 5 days of insertion. The most common reasons for removal within 5 days (67.8% of 5-day midline dwells) were completion of therapy and patient discharge. A total of 13.5% of midlines remained in place beyond 30 days (figure 1a). Most patients (n = 994, 85.6%) who received a midline did not have a PICC or central venous catheter placed within the past 3 months, suggesting that midlines were not used as 'step-down' device from more invasive lines. Informed consent for midline catheter placement was obtained in 36.2% (n = 420) of patients.

### The practice and complications of midline catheters: a systematic review [^113o52Cj]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Midline catheters are considered "midway" regarding vascular access. The objective of this systematic review was to explore the current practice, dwell time, and complication rates of midline catheters.

Design

Systematic review.

Setting

Search on four databases, PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, and Embase, were conducted for English language articles published after the year 2000.

Measurements and Main Results

A total of 987 articles were identified, of which 31 manuscripts met the inclusion criteria and were selected for review. Quality assurance was performed based on the Newcastle-Ottawa score. Average dwell time and complication rates were calculated for studies involving adult patients and adjusted for sample size. This analysis included data from the placement of 18,972 midline catheters across five countries. Aside from two randomized control trials, most of the studies analyzed were cohort studies. One pediatric and two neonatal studies were included. The average dwell time was 16.3 days (n = 4,412). The adjusted mean infection rate was 0.28/1,000 catheter days, with 64% of studies not reporting any infection with midline catheter. The failure rate of midline catheters was 12.5%. Adjusted average rates of other significant complications included the following: deep vein thrombosis (4.1%), dislodgement (5.0%), occlusion (3.8%), phlebitis (3.4%), and infiltration (1.9%).

Conclusions

The dwell times and failure rates of midline catheters compare favorably against published data on other types of catheters. Their infection rates are also lower than the reported rates of central venous catheters; however, they have a higher rate of mechanical complications. Active surveillance of infections due to midline catheters is recommended. More data are needed from pediatric and neonatal populations.

### Midline vs peripherally inserted central catheter for outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy [^114ewHpB]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the occurrence of a major device complication, ie, documented catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) or catheter-related venous thromboembolism (CR-VTE). Among patients with PICCs, CRBSI events included central line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) in accordance with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/National Healthcare Safety Network criteria of laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infection (BSI) with a PICC in place for at least 48 hours without another identified source of BSI or physician documentation of catheter line sepsis, catheter-related bacteremia/fungemia, or PICC removal due to suspected CLABSI. Among those with midline catheters, CRBSI was defined as laboratory-confirmed BSI with a midline catheter in place and no other identified source of BSI or physician documentation of catheter line sepsis, catheter-related bacteremia/fungemia, or midline catheter removal due to suspected CRBSI. CR-VTE included symptomatic image-confirmed upper-extremity deep vein thrombosis and symptomatic image-confirmed pulmonary embolism.

The secondary outcomes were minor complications (eg, catheter dislodgement, occlusion, tip migration, infiltration, superficial thrombophlebitis, and exit site concerns [including leaking, discharge, or infection]) and device failure, which was defined as removal of the device because of any complication. We chose this composite secondary outcome because (1) premature removal is a meaningful end point for both patients and clinicians and (2) device complications are often competing events where the occurrence of a complication (eg, occlusion) may influence the probability of another (eg, phlebitis). Thus, using premature device removal as a distinct end point better encapsulates clinical impact of these events. We used validated, published definitions to capture and record all major and minor complications.

### Strategies to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^112d9R7D]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Central line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) prevention — device choice at insertion: Do not use peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs) as a strategy to reduce the risk of CLABSI. Risk of infection with PICCs in hospitalized patients approaches that of other CVCs, and the majority of CLABSIs due to PICCs occur in non-ICU settings. Midline catheters are increasingly being used as an alternative to CVCs for short-term vascular access, with some observational studies suggesting lower bloodstream infection risk associated with midline catheters versus PICCs and versus CVCs, respectively; randomized controlled trials comparing these devices are needed.

### 2018 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guideline for the management of outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy [^112S3U4D]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Vascular access devices — In adult patients needing short courses of outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) (less than 14 days), a midline catheter (MC) may be used rather than a central venous catheter (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). No recommendations can be made regarding the use of MCs in pediatric patients.
