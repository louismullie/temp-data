## Question

Traetment for linfangitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment for lymphangitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical entity and its major subtypes. Then, I should verify the likely etiologies and pathogens. Next, I will outline a diagnostic approach to distinguish mimics. After that, I will specify treatment by subtype, including bacterial, nonbacterial, and malignant lymphangitis. Finally, I should address special populations, prevention of recurrence, and when to escalate care, while continuously checking the strength of evidence and citing appropriately.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and its subtypes, because treatment hinges on etiology. Lymphangitis is inflammation of lymphatic channels, most often presenting with erythematous streaks tracking proximally from a portal of entry; clinically, it spans bacterial lymphangitis (often cellulitis/erysipelas with lymphangitic streaking), nodular lymphangitis (sporotrichoid spread from atypical pathogens), malignant lymphangitis (lymphangitis carcinomatosa), and immune-related or iatrogenic lymphangitis, and I need to ensure I keep these categories in mind as I proceed [^8ec32fa4] [^3c893d88] [^93986231] [^77f85260].

> I will now examine likely etiologies and pathogens for bacterial lymphangitis, since empiric therapy depends on this. In adults, streptococci predominate, with Staphylococcus aureus also common; MRSA is a consideration in purulent disease or high-risk settings, and Gram-negative coverage is prudent in immunocompromised hosts or when systemic toxicity is present, so I should confirm local epidemiology and host factors before finalizing antibiotics [^8ec32fa4] [^7ae6ae84] [^fffa47f0].

> Wait, let me verify the nonbacterial causes that can mimic bacterial lymphangitis, because misclassification leads to delays. Nodular lymphangitis is classically due to Sporothrix schenckii, Nocardia brasiliensis, Mycobacterium marinum, or Leishmania species, often following inoculation from plants, fish, or water exposure; viral etiologies like HSV can produce lymphangitic streaking, and immune checkpoint inhibitors can precipitate thoracic lymphangitis as an irAE, so I need to check exposure history, lesion morphology, and systemic context carefully [^3c893d88] [^2db5f340] [^77f85260].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach to avoid anchoring on bacteria alone. I need to check for a portal of entry, systemic signs, and the distribution of erythema; in recurrent lower-extremity disease, I should assess for lymphedema, venous insufficiency, tinea pedis, and interdigital maceration, and consider imaging such as ultrasound if abscess is suspected or CT if deep infection or malignancy is a concern; for suspected lymphedema, lymphoscintigraphy or ICG can help stage disease, though availability varies and results may not change acute management [^8ec32fa4] [^d6b867fe] [^72a9a2a4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment before I align it to subtype. For typical bacterial lymphangitis/cellulitis without purulence, I should start an oral beta-lactam active against streptococci (e.g., cephalexin 500 mg every 6 hours) for 5 days, extending to 7–10 days if slow response; if MRSA risk is high or purulence is present, add MRSA-active therapy such as doxycycline, TMP-SMX, or clindamycin; in severe disease or systemic toxicity, use IV therapy with cefazolin, ceftriaxone, or nafcillin/oxacillin, adding vancomycin or linezolid if MRSA is suspected; I should confirm local antibiograms and adjust based on culture if obtained [^8ec32fa4] [^7ae6ae84].

> I should double-check the nonbacterial nodular lymphangitis management, because duration and agent differ. For Sporothrix, itraconazole 200 mg daily for 6–12 months is standard; for Nocardia, TMP-SMX for 3 months is effective; for M. marinum, clarithromycin plus ethambutol or doxycycline for 2–3 months after clearance is reasonable, with awareness of paradoxical reactions that can transiently worsen disease; for cutaneous leishmaniasis with nodular lymphangitis, systemic therapy such as pentavalent antimonials or miltefosine is indicated rather than local therapy, and I need to ensure species risk and mucosal dissemination risk are weighed [^3c893d88] [^81f89fcc] [^7e3d736d] [^7417e8cc] [^8ead4c1d].

> But wait, what if the lymphangitis is malignant rather than infectious. Lymphangitis carcinomatosa reflects tumor invasion of lymphatics and is managed with oncologic therapy rather than antibiotics; case-based evidence supports EGFR-directed therapy in appropriate molecular contexts, and steroids may be used for symptom control in selected scenarios; I should confirm tissue diagnosis and molecular profiling to guide targeted therapy and coordinate with oncology urgently [^2dd47d67] [^44317f87].

> I need to ensure I address immune-related lymphangitis appropriately. Thoracic lymphangitis as an irAE has been reported after immune checkpoint inhibitors and responded to high-dose corticosteroids; if suspected, I should rule out infection and malignancy promptly and initiate steroid therapy with close monitoring, ideally in consultation with oncology and pulmonology [^77f85260] [^8bf9ccd9].

> Let me consider special populations and settings, because standard pathways may not fit. In children, HSV lymphangitis can mimic bacterial disease; I should look for vesicles and consider acyclovir if HSV is confirmed, while still covering for common bacterial pathogens if bacterial coinfection cannot be excluded; in pregnancy, I should avoid fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines and favor beta-lactams; in dialysis patients with lung cancer and malignant lymphangitis, afatinib has been used successfully when appropriate driver mutations are present, underscoring the need to test for oncogenic drivers despite renal impairment [^2db5f340] [^234e3dce] [^2dd47d67].

> Next, I should review prevention of recurrence, especially in patients with lymphedema or repeated cellulitis/lymphangitis. Daily skin care, compression therapy, exercise, and weight optimization reduce recurrence; in filarial or podoconiosis-related lymphedema, hygiene-based morbidity management reduces acute dermatolymphangioadenitis episodes; I initially thought doxycycline might add benefit for filarial lymphedema, but wait, randomized trials show no added benefit from a 6-week doxycycline course over hygiene alone, so I should correct that assumption and avoid routine doxycycline for lymphedema progression or ADLA prevention in this context [^883fee42] [^a9af3337] [^2598d273] [^5ac4ac1e].

> I should confirm when to escalate care or involve specialists. Indications for hospitalization include hemodynamic instability, rapidly progressive infection, immunocompromise, failure of oral therapy, concern for necrotizing infection, or inability to care for self; surgical consultation is warranted for suspected abscess, necrosis, or deep infection, and interventional radiology may be needed for drainage or source control; in suspected malignant lymphangitis, urgent oncology input and tissue diagnosis are essential to avoid delays in disease-directed therapy [^8ec32fa4] [^7ae6ae84].

> In summary, I need to ensure my treatment is etiology-specific: treat bacterial lymphangitis with appropriate antibiotics and duration based on severity and local resistance patterns; treat nodular lymphangitis with prolonged organism-directed therapy; treat malignant lymphangitis with oncologic therapy; treat immune-related lymphangitis with steroids after excluding infection and malignancy; and embed prevention strategies for those with chronic lymphedema to reduce recurrence, while continuously verifying the diagnosis and adjusting therapy as new data emerge [^8ec32fa4] [^3c893d88] [^2dd47d67] [^77f85260] [^883fee42].

Lymphangitis is treated with **prompt antibiotics targeting streptococci and staphylococci** [^8ec32fa4] (penicillin, amoxicillin, or a first-generation cephalosporin; add MRSA coverage if risk factors exist) [^7ae6ae84] for 5–10 days, with extension if slow response [^8ec32fa4]. Supportive care includes **elevation, warm compresses, analgesics, and hydration** [^notfound]; hospitalize for systemic illness, immunocompromise, or failure of oral therapy [^notfound]. Identify and treat the portal of entry (e.g. tinea pedis, wounds) [^8ec32fa4] to prevent recurrence [^d0888039]. Nonbacterial causes (e.g. sporotrichosis, leishmaniasis) require organism-specific therapy [^3c893d88] [^7417e8cc], and malignant lymphangitis needs oncologic management [^2dd47d67].

---

## Antibiotic therapy

Empiric antibiotic therapy should **cover streptococci and staphylococci**, the most common pathogens [^8ec32fa4]:

- **First-line therapy**: Penicillin, amoxicillin, or first-generation cephalosporins (e.g. cephalexin) [^7ae6ae84].
- **MRSA coverage**: Add clindamycin, doxycycline, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole if MRSA risk factors are present [^7ae6ae84].
- **Duration**: Typically 5–10 days, extending if clinical response is slow [^8ec32fa4].

---

## Supportive care

Supportive measures are essential to **reduce inflammation and promote healing**:

- **Elevation**: Elevate the affected limb to reduce swelling and improve lymphatic drainage.
- **Warm compresses**: Apply warm compresses to the affected area to alleviate discomfort and promote circulation.
- **Analgesics**: Use acetaminophen or NSAIDs for pain control.
- **Hydration**: Maintain adequate hydration to support immune function and recovery.

---

## Hospitalization and advanced care

Hospitalization is indicated for patients with **severe systemic symptoms**, immunocompromised status, or failure of oral antibiotic therapy. Intravenous antibiotics (e.g. ceftriaxone, nafcillin, vancomycin) are recommended for severe cases or when MRSA is suspected [^7ae6ae84]. Surgical intervention may be necessary if abscess formation or necrotizing infection develops [^65e51177].

---

## Management of underlying conditions

Addressing underlying conditions is critical to **prevent recurrence**:

- **Tinea pedis**: Treat with topical or systemic antifungal agents to prevent recurrent bacterial infections [^notfound].
- **Chronic lymphedema**: Implement compression therapy, manual lymphatic drainage, and skin care protocols [^883fee42].
- **Wound care**: Proper wound care and infection control measures are essential to prevent secondary infections [^d76d57b2].

---

## Special considerations

Nonbacterial lymphangitis requires **organism-specific therapy** — itraconazole for sporotrichosis [^3c893d88], antimonial compounds for leishmaniasis [^7417e8cc], and oncologic treatment for malignant lymphangitis [^2dd47d67]. Immunocompromised patients may need broader-spectrum antibiotics and longer treatment durations due to increased risk of severe infections [^8ec32fa4].

---

## Follow-up and prevention

Regular follow-up is essential to ensure **complete resolution** and to monitor for recurrence. Patient education on hygiene, skin care, and early recognition of infection signs is critical for prevention [^a9af3337].

---

Lymphangitis treatment centers on **prompt antibiotics**, supportive care, and management of underlying conditions, with hospitalization for severe cases.

### Cellulitis and erysipelas [^fffa47f0]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cellulitis is a common problem, caused by spreading bacterial inflammation of the skin, with redness, pain, and lymphangitis. Up to 40% of affected people have systemic illness. Erysipelas is a form of cellulitis with marked superficial inflammation, typically affecting the lower limbs and the face. The most common pathogens in adults are streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. Cellulitis and erysipelas can result in local necrosis and abscess formation. Around a quarter of affected people have more than one episode of cellulitis within 3 years.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for cellulitis and erysipelas? What are the effects of treatments to prevent recurrence of cellulitis and erysipelas? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to May 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 14 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics, comparative effects of different antibiotic regimens, duration of antibiotics, and treatment of predisposing factors.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic overview, aiming to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments to prevent recurrence of cellulitis and erysipelas? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to February 2015 (Clinical Evidence overviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this overview).

Results

At this update, searching of electronic databases retrieved 323 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 184 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 170 studies and the further review of 14 full publications. Of the 14 full articles evaluated, one systematic review was added at this update. We performed a GRADE evaluation for one PICO combination.

Conclusions

In this systematic overview, we categorised the efficacy for two interventions based on information about to the effectiveness and safety of antibiotics and treatment of predisposing factors.

### Thoracic lymphangitis as an immune-related adverse event: a case report [^b24a7c5d]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has been widely recognized for several cancers, and they are now being used in the perioperative setting for lung cancer, whereas there is a certain proportion of patients who experience adverse events that prevent them from continuing treatment. It is predicted that unexperienced immune-related adverse event (irAE) may occur by administering ICIs in a larger number of cancer patients.

A more definite diagnosis to base further clinical management on can be made with non-specific diagnostic tests (e.g. light microscopy). These tests do not allow for species identification and Leishmania species vary in their sensitivity to available drugs. If one species is dominating an endemic geographic region, the preferred treatment can be based on local (trial- and error-based) experience. However, geographically driven treatment is inadequate in many endemic regions where multiple Leishmania species prevail, of which each require a different therapy. For example, in many settings in Middle and South America, species causing both CL and MCL are endemic in the same regions. Because leishmaniasis manifestations require different management (see next paragraph), it is important to know which species is involved for the best treatment outcome, with the least side effects and late complications.

For appropriate and effective clinical management, it is important that cheap and reliable species-specific diagnostic tests become available, especially in cases where treatment failure arises. In low-resource settings where healthcare infrastructure is sparse, rapid diagnostics are also critical to deliver timely treatment (preferably at the first consultation), thus preventing loss to follow-up due to required return visits. CL species-specific driven management is also important in non-endemic settings where travelers with CL are seen, especially if different endemic areas have been visited and the causative species is unclear.

Species determination is also important for clinical trials because the outcome is affected by the species infecting the participants. A Cochrane review on the treatment of New World CL found that 4 out of 38 trials failed to mention the causative parasite. Six trials mentioned the endemic nature of the parasite in the area and therefore assumed that the specific parasite strain was the species causing the development of the disease. Another two trials accepted that the parasites species were the same as in previous studies, and only 26 studies confirmed the causative species.

### Current views on diagnostic approach and treatment of lymphedema [^300c1cdb]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Lymphedema is a chronic, progressive, and often debilitating condition. Primary lymphedema is a lymphatic malformation developing during the later stage of lymphangiogenesis. Secondary lymphedema is the result of obstruction or disruption of the lymphatic system, which can occur as a consequence of tumors, surgery, trauma, infection, inflammation, and radiation therapy. In this review, we report an update upon the diagnostic approach and the medical and surgical therapy for both primary and secondary lymphedema.

### Thoracic lymphangitis as an immune-related adverse event: a case report [^7a44de5e]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We experienced unrecognized irAE, thoracic lymphangitis, which occurred after ICI treatment for lung cancer. The irAE is considered a significant side effect leading to respiratory failure.

The causes for localized lymphangitis in the right lower lobe are considered as follows:
First, in this case, surgery including bronchoplasty in the left upper lobe was performed, and lymph node dissection was carried out without omission. Therefore, it is believed that lymphangitis did not occur in the left lung.
Second, the lymphatic pathways in the right upper lobe are unaffected as they drain into the right lymphatic duct through a separate route.
Third, the lymphatic vessels within the right lower lobe that drain into the inferior tracheobronchial nodes are believed to have developed lymphangitis because of lymphatic congestion resulting from postoperative chylothorax therapy and further exacerbated by the activation of lymphocytes associated with ICI.

No reports of thoracic lymphangitis as an irAE after ICI administration exist. As the frequency of using neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and perioperative ICI is expected to increase in the future, it is crucial to understand and monitor this adverse event.

### Official American Thoracic Society / Japanese Respiratory Society clinical practice guidelines: lymphangioleiomyomatosis diagnosis and management [^668ca98e]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare cystic lung disease that primarily affects women. The purpose of these guidelines is to provide recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of LAM.

Methods

Systematic reviews were performed to summarize evidence pertinent to our questions. The evidence was summarized and discussed by a multidisciplinary panel. Evidence-based recommendations were then formulated, written, and graded using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach.

Results

After considering the panel's confidence in the estimated effects, the balance of desirable (i.e., benefits) and undesirable (i.e., harms and burdens) consequences of treatment, patient values and preferences, cost, and feasibility, recommendations were formulated for or against specific interventions. These included recommendations for sirolimus treatment and vascular endothelial growth factor D testing and recommendations against doxycycline and hormonal therapy.

Conclusions

Evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with LAM are provided. Frequent reassessment and updating will be needed.

### Lymphangiogenesis in development and human disease [^8bb1a892]. Nature (2005). Excellent credibility.

The lymphatic vasculature forms a vessel network that drains interstitial fluid from tissues and returns it to the blood. Lymphatic vessels are also an essential part of the body's immune defence. They have an important role in the pathogenesis of several diseases, such as cancer, lymphoedema and various inflammatory conditions. Recent biological and technological developments in lymphatic vascular biology will lead to a better understanding and treatment of these diseases.

### Kaposiform lymphangiomatosis: diagnosis, pathogenesis, and treatment [^789647c2]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Kaposiform lymphangiomatosis (KLA) is a life-threatening rare disease that can cause substantial morbidity, mortality, and social burdens for patients and their families. Diagnosis often occurs long after initial symptoms, and there are few centers in the world with the expertise to diagnose and care for patients with the disease. KLA is a lymphatic anomaly and significant advancements have been made in understanding its pathogenesis and etiology since its first description in 2014. This review provides multidisciplinary, comprehensive, and state-of-the-art information on KLA patient presentation, diagnostic imaging, pathology, organ involvement, genetics, and pathogenesis. Finally, we describe current therapeutic approaches, important areas for research, and challenges faced by patients and their families. Further insights into the pathogenesis of KLA may advance our understanding of other vascular anomalies given that similar signaling pathways may be involved.

### Managing lymphedema induced by lymphatic filariasis: implementing and improving care at the individual and programmatic levels [^9b9cf97e]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Infection with parasitic worms of the “lymphatic filariasis (LF) group” (Wuchereria bancroft i and the Brugia species) can result not only in the very recognizable clinical pathologies of lymphedema and hydrocele but also in more subtle physical changes such as abnormalities of the deep lymphatic system and renal function. Of the more prominent clinical manifestations, hydroceles are most directly addressable because with good surgical practice this condition is generally correctable. The other predominant manifestation is lymphedema, which presents a much greater challenge in terms of providing care that can reverse, or at least slow, the progression of the disease. It is this markedly debilitating, disfiguring presentation that leads to the most recognizable hallmarks of LF infection (e.g. grossly swollen limbs, multiple skinfolds, extensive dermal changes, and ultimately “elephantiasis” †), all associated with severe stigma and psychosocial consequences in affected individuals.

The principal challenges to improving the management of patients’ lymphedema include not only the need to better understand the pathogenesis of filarial lymphedema, which might offer new treatment approaches, but also to tailor currently available treatments for use in the often-difficult field conditions in which many such patients live. It is important to recognize that the lymphedema resulting from this parasitic infection has distinct physical pathologies affecting vessels, tissues, and organs and that each of these components is a possible target for new therapies and approaches to improve the WHO’s recommended Essential Package of Care (EPC) (Figure 1) for lymphedema treatment. Despite the extensive and laudable successes many countries have had with the mass drug administration (MDA) elements of the Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) that have interrupted (and possibly eliminated) the transmission of filarial infections, many countries still need to address GPELF’s second target: alleviating the suffering associated with LF through targeted programs of morbidity management and disability prevention (MMDP).Improving the tools and strategies to address these MMDP issues is critical for assisting LF-endemic countries in reaching their MMDP goals. These targets remain essential to fulfilling their national commitment to ensure the ultimate success of GPELF.

### Cutaneous leishmaniasis: recent developments in diagnosis and management [^2922ba1c]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Treatment

In the majority of cases, CL is a self-healing disease. Nonetheless, nodular lymphangitis and MCL can lead to disabling and atrocious tissue destruction. Full recovery can take months to years, and this period can be characterized by function impairment, susceptibility to secondary infection, and the development of disfiguring permanent scars. Because little evidence-based data are available, most therapy options have to rely on expert opinions. In many settings where species identification is unavailable, the mode of therapy is mainly based on local expertise only. Most of the currently available therapeutic options are associated with significant toxicity and side effects. Therefore, a risk-benefit assessment must be made by an experienced clinician for each CL patient, and, in mild and indolent cases, a wait-and-see policy can sometimes be the best advisable option. Moreover, drug resistance is an emerging problem in the control of CL.

Several treatment options for CL are available. Pentavalent antimonals (sodium stibogluconate, Pentostam ® or meglumine antimoniate, Glucantime ®) remain the first-choice treatment for CL in most countries. Alternative treatment regimens include miltefosine, pentamidine isethionate, amphotericin B, antifungal agents (e.g. ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazol), paromomycine, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and heat therapy or cryotherapy.

Treatment of Old World CL

In cases of a few (less than five) lesions, local therapy is preferred. Local treatment combining intralesional antimony and cryotherapy proved more effective than antimony or cryotherapy alone, although as monotherapies, both also show high cure rates. Heat therapy has also proven to be effective but requires special equipment. Systemic treatment can be considered for multiple lesions, disfiguring facial lesions, or lesions at sites that make topical treatment less desirable. Systemic (oral) miltefosine treatment is a promising option for patients with multiple or complicated Old World CL (L. major) lesions.

### Sporotrichoid lymphocutaneous infections: etiology, diagnosis and therapy [^3c893d88]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Sporotrichoid lymphocutaneous infection is an uncommon syndrome that is often misdiagnosed and improperly treated. Of the several hundred cases seen each year in the United States, the majority are caused by Sporothrix schenckii, Nocardia brasiliensis, Mycobacterium marinum or Leishmania brasiliensis. The "sporotrichoid" disease begins at a site of distal inoculation and leads to the development of nodular lymphangitis. Systemic symptoms are characteristically absent. By recognizing the distinct pattern of nodular lymphangitis and focusing on the diverse but limited etiologies, the physician can obtain the appropriate histologic and microbiologic studies and start targeted antimicrobial therapy. Therapy is generally continued for two to three months after the resolution of cutaneous disease.

### Cutaneous leishmaniasis: a 2022 updated narrative review into diagnosis and management developments [^8ead4c1d]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment

In most cases, CL is self-limiting. Nonetheless, irreversible disfiguring scar formation often occurs, and nodular lymphangitis and MCL can complicate the outcome with lasting disability and permanent unsightly destruction. The recovery period can be hindered by secondary bacterial infections and can take months to years, during which time patients have to deal with function impairment. In the absence of sound evidence, most therapy options are based on expert opinion. Moreover, when species identification is not available, therapy options have to rely on local expertise. CL has been largely neglected for drug development because it affects poor people in poor regions of the world. Most of the current drugs used to treat CL are decades old and have many limitations such significant toxicity and side effects. Costs are another challenge in low- and middle-income endemic settings, especially with the systemic treatment options. A clinician with in-depth knowledge of the outcome of CL and the therapeutic options should make a tailored management plan in close discussion with the patient (shared decision making). A risk–benefit assessment of therapeutic options should be made, and in mild and indolent cases a wait-and-see policy can sometimes be the best option. Moreover, drug resistance is an emerging problem in the control of CL.

Several treatment options for CL are available. Pentavalent antimonials (sodium stibogluconate—Pentostam ® or meglumine antimoniate—Glucantime ®) remain the first treatment option for CL in most countries. Alternative treatment regimens include miltefosine, pentamidine isethionate, amphotericin B, antifungal agents (e.g. ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, paromomycin, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and heat therapy or cryotherapy. Although attempts are being made to discover novel drugs against CL (e.g. via smart ex vivo compounds screening technology), promising therapeutic breakthroughs for CL are decades away from the clinic.

### Nodular lymphangitis due to nocardiosis [^81f89fcc]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Nodular lymphangitis is an infectious disease characterised by the development of inflammatory skin nodules that follow the direction of lymphatic drainage. We present a woman in her 70s with nodular lymphangitis that developed after mild trauma with a cactus. Surgical intervention was performed on a finger abscess with isolation of Nocardia brasiliensis in the microbiological samples. Initial antibiotherapy was modified, treating with cotrimoxazole, firstly intravenous and finally oral, therapy during 3 months with a complete resolution of the infection.

### Physical therapies in the decongestive treatment of lymphedema: a randomized, non-inferiority controlled study [^a4fcd0a1]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess whether the treatment with intermittent pneumatic compression plus multilayer bandages is not inferior to classical trimodal therapy with manual lymphatic drainage in the decongestive lymphedema treatment.

Study Design

Randomized, non-inferiority, controlled study to compare the efficacy of three physical therapies' regimens in the Decongestive Lymphatic Therapy.

Participants

194 lymphedema patients, stage II-III with excess volume > 10% were stratified within upper and lower limb and then randomized to one of the three treatment groups. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the groups.

Intervention

all patients were prescribed 20 sessions of the following regimens: Group A (control group): manual lymphatic drainage + Intermittent Pneumatic Compression + Bandages; Group B: pneumatic lymphatic drainage + Intermittent Pneumatic Compression + Bandages; and Group C: only Intermittent Pneumatic Compression + Bandages.

End-Point

Percentage reduction in excess volume (PREV).

Results

All patients improved after treatment. Global mean of PREV was 63.9%, without significant differences between the groups. The lower confidence interval of the mean difference in PREV between group B and group A, and between group C and group A were below 15%, thus meeting the non-inferiority criterion. Most frequent adverse events were discomfort and lymphangitis, without differences between groups. A greater baseline edema, an upper-limb lymphedema and a history of dermatolymphangitis were independent predictive factors of worse response in the multivariate analysis.

Conclusions

Decongestive lymphatic therapy performed only with intermittent pneumatic compression plus bandages is not inferior to the traditional trimodal therapy with manual lymphatic drainage. This approach did not increase adverse events.

### Erlotinib-induced breast cancer regression [^44317f87]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of erlotinib-induced breast cancer regression.

Case Summary

A 38-year-old woman developed bilateral locoregional malignant cutaneous lymphangitis following a right subcutaneous mastectomy and 3 months of adjuvant chemotherapy. After several systemic chemotherapy regimens, the lymphangitis worsened rapidly, with progressive skin ulceration. Morphine and dexamethasone were given, with suboptimal pain control. A chemotherapy regimen of gemcitabine and vinorelbine was started. After 2 full-dose administrations, while lymphangitis continued to worsen, erlotinib 150 mg/day was added to the regimen. After 10 weeks of treatment, pain subsided and analgesics were discontinued. Physical examination revealed a partial regression of malignant cutaneous lymphangitis and pulmonary metastases, with resolution of ulceration.

Discussion

There has been increased interest in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the treatment of breast cancer. Gefitinib has shown a low level of efficacy, while preliminary clinical data on erlotinib were not conclusive and suggested lack of clinical activity. Molecular analysis of the tumor in our patient revealed a profile predictive of response to EGFR selective inhibitors in some patients with lung cancer.

Conclusions

The addition of erlotinib to our patient's chemotherapy regimen resulted in antitumor activity in breast cancer in which an activated EGFR pathway was demonstrated. This finding is consistent with available preclinical and clinical data on EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors across tumor types and supports the efforts to optimize EGFR selective inhibitors in treating breast cancer and other malignancies.

### Systemic generalised lymphangiomatosis: unknown aetiology and a challenge to treat [^24a758c4]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Therefore, this case report highlights an important role of the angiogenesis inhibitors in the treatment of symptomatic and therapy resistant systemic generalised lymphangiomatosis.

Lymphopenia is not a limiting factor. Increase in absolute numbers of lymphocytes under sirolimus treatment might even be considered as a positive result with a possible benefit, including a decreased risk of secondary infectious complications.

Further insights in the pathogenesis of the disease and targeted treatments can result in a better outcome of patients with diffuse lymphangiomatosis.

Learning points

Systemic generalised lymphangiomatosis is a benign disorder that may mimic malignancy with severe symptoms and aggressive behaviour.
There is no uniform consensus on treatment of generalised lymphangiomatosis.
Promising results can be expected with angiogenesis inhibitors.

### Diagnosis and treatment of leishmaniasis: clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH) [^7417e8cc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) local therapy—patient selection, precautions, and alternatives are outlined as follows: Local therapy may be a good option for those with small, few lesions that do not involve the nose, ears, eyelids, lips, or genitalia; for pregnant patients when systemic therapy may be contraindicated; and for mop-up after incomplete systemic response. Combination therapy (eg, local therapy plus an azole or cryotherapy plus intralesional SbV) may be considered for some patients, and failure of initial local treatment can be managed with oral or parenteral systemic therapy. Local therapy usually is not recommended if the risk for mucosal dissemination is considered substantial, including infection acquired south of Nicaragua with Viannia species, and is also not usually recommended with nodular lymphangitis or in immunocompromised hosts. Before initiating local therapy, lesions should be debrided to a clean ulcer base and any secondary bacterial infection treated; areas where scarring is an issue (eyelids, nose, lips) should be avoided.

### Nonbacterial causes of lymphangitis with streaking [^293f5d34]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Lymphangitic streaking, characterized by linear erythema on the skin, is most commonly observed in the setting of bacterial infection. However, a number of nonbacterial causes can result in lymphangitic streaking. We sought to elucidate the nonbacterial causes of lymphangitic streaking that may mimic bacterial infection to broaden clinicians' differential diagnosis for patients presenting with lymphangitic streaking.

Methods

We performed a review of the literature, including all available reports pertaining to nonbacterial causes of lymphangitic streaking.

Results

Various nonbacterial causes can result in lymphangitic streaking, including viral and fungal infections, insect or spider bites, and iatrogenic etiologies.

Conclusion

Awareness of potential nonbacterial causes of superficial lymphangitis is important to avoid misdiagnosis and delay the administration of appropriate care.

### Afatinib treatment of severe respiratory failure due to malignant lymphangitis in a dialysis patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung [^2dd47d67]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Patients on dialysis have limited treatment options for advanced lung cancer because some chemotherapeutic agents are unavailable due to renal dysfunction. A man in his 70s on peritoneal dialysis presented with persistent fever refractory to antibiotics for 2weeks. Subsequent whole-body CT showed a 5cm diameter mass in the right lower lobe of the lung with right-sided pleural effusion and osteolytic metastasis of the right iliac bone. The patient was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma (cT3N2M1b, stage IVB) harbouring the p.Gly719Ala point mutation on exon 18 of the epidermal growth factor receptor. The patient developed severe respiratory failure due to malignant lymphangitis after a bronchoscopy. He received 30mg/day of afatinib, resulting in tumour shrinkage and recovery from respiratory failure. We advocate for aggressive screening of driver oncogenes in patients with lung cancer on dialysis, including those with squamous cell lung cancer.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaChylothorax treatment planning [^ac3917dd]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Chylothorax is an uncommon but serious medical condition, which arises when intestinal lymphatic fluid leaks into the pleural space. Treatment strategies depend on the daily output and underlying etiology, which may be due to direct injury to lymphatic vessels or a nontraumatic disorder. Chest radiographs confirm the presence of pleural fluid and lateralize the process. In the setting of direct injury, lymphangiography can often be both diagnostic and facilitate a minimally invasive attempt at therapy. CT and MRI in this setting may be appropriate for cases when lymphangiography is not diagnostic. When the etiology is nontraumatic or unknown, CT or MRI can narrow the differential diagnosis, and lymphangiography is useful if a minimally invasive approach to treatment is desired. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Lymphangioleiomyomatosis diagnosis and management: high-resolution chest computed tomography, transbronchial lung biopsy, and pleural disease management. An official American Thoracic Society / Japanese Respiratory Society clinical practice guideline [^bfdf733b]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Recommendations regarding key aspects related to the diagnosis and pharmacological treatment of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) were recently published. We now provide additional recommendations regarding four specific questions related to the diagnosis of LAM and management of pneumothoraces in patients with LAM.

Methods

Systematic reviews were performed and then discussed by a multidisciplinary panel. For each intervention, the panel considered its confidence in the estimated effects, the balance of desirable (i.e., benefits) and undesirable (i.e., harms and burdens) consequences, patient values and preferences, cost, and feasibility. Evidence-based recommendations were then formulated, written, and graded using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach.

Results

For women who have cystic changes on high-resolution computed tomography of the chest characteristic of LAM, but who have no additional confirmatory features of LAM (i.e., clinical, radiologic, or serologic), the guideline panel made conditional recommendations against making a clinical diagnosis of LAM on the basis of the high-resolution computed tomography findings alone and for considering transbronchial lung biopsy as a diagnostic tool. The guideline panel also made conditional recommendations for offering pleurodesis after an initial pneumothorax rather than postponing the procedure until the first recurrence and against pleurodesis being used as a reason to exclude patients from lung transplantation.

Conclusions

Evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with LAM are provided. Frequent reassessment and updating will be needed.

### Narrowing the gap in managing the lymphedema of lymphatic filariasis [^3b3a0da7]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

In all, more than 1,400 patients with LF lymphedema were monitored intensively for 2 years,recording clinical observations that included signs and symptoms of lymphedema and adenolymphangitis, physical and volumetric measurements of lymphedema, qualitative assessment of well-being, compliance with provided medications, and adherence to EPC recommendations. The primary endpoint at 2 years was scored as “improved,” “not improved”, or “worsened” lymphedema. Overall, 16–40% of patients showed “improved” lymphedema, whereas only a small number showed “worsened” lymphedema. A decreased frequency and duration of adenolymphangitis events and improved, qualitatively assessed well-being were also observed in study participants from all of the sites. Notably, however, these positive changes were nearly identical in patients randomized to treatment with doxycycline versus those receiving the placebo. Thus, the results of these studies, while appreciably strengthening the evidence base for the effectiveness of EPC in managing LF lymphedema, did not identify additional clinical benefit from adjunctive treatment with doxycycline. Modest variability in outcomes from the different study sites and the reasons for these differences are being analyzed to gain deeper insight into the management of LF lymphedema and to enhance uptake of best practices by patients and the local health systems that serve them.

Cutaneous leishmaniasis—CL presents with a broad variety of dermatologic manifestations on exposed skin, often appearing within several weeks after infection but sometimes months or years later and often evolving over time. Lesions may progress from small, erythematous papules or nodular plaques to open sores with raised borders and central craters that can be covered with crusts or scales. Lesions are usually painless unless superinfected; satellite lesions, regional lymphadenopathy, and nodular lymphangitis can occur. Even without treatment, most lesions eventually heal but can last for months or years and typically result in scarring.

### Sirolimus [^9f2baf96]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.7 Lymphangioleiomyomatosis Patients

The safety and efficacy of sirolimus for treatment of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) were assessed in a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, controlled trial. This study compared sirolimus (dose-adjusted to maintain blood trough concentrations between 5-15 ng/mL) with placebo for a 12-month treatment period, followed by a 12-month observation period. Eighty-nine (89) patients were enrolled; 43 patients were randomized to receive placebo and 46 patients to receive sirolimus. The primary endpoint was the difference between the groups in the rate of change (slope) per month in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). During the treatment period, the FEV1 slope was -12±2 mL per month in the placebo group and 1±2 mL per month in the sirolimus group (treatment difference = 13 mL (95% CI: 7, 18). The absolute between-group difference in the mean change in FEV1 during the 12-month treatment period was 153 mL, or approximately 11% of the mean FEV1 at enrollment. Similar improvements were seen for forced vital capacity (FVC). After discontinuation of sirolimus, the decline in lung function resumed in the sirolimus group and paralleled that in the placebo group (see Figure 1).

 FIGURE 1: CHANGE IN FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1 SECOND (FEV1) DURING THE TREATMENT AND OBSERVATION PHASES OF THE STUDY IN LAM PATIENTS

The rate of change over 12 months of vascular endothelial growth factor-D (VEGF-D), a lymphangiogenic growth factor which has been shown to be elevated in patients with LAM, was significantly different in the sirolimus -treated group (-88.0 ± 16.6 pg/mL/month) compared to placebo (-2.42 ± 17.2 pg/mL/month) with a treatment difference of -86 pg/mL/month (95% CI: -133, -39). The absolute between-group difference in the mean change in VEGF-D during the 12-month treatment period was -1017.2, or approximately 50% of the mean VEGF-D at enrollment.

### Cutaneous lymphangitis carcinomatosa made cervicofacial oedema intractable in a patient with superior vena cava syndrome [^406bfc16]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

When lung cancer progression causes symptoms that reduce the ability to manage daily activities, adequate symptom treatment is required. Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome is a major complication of lung cancer that occurs when the lung tumour compresses the SVC extrinsically, which causes cervicofacial oedema and dyspnoea.Among treatment options for SVC syndrome, an indwelling SVC stent effectively improves symptoms within a few days.Cutaneous lymphangitis carcinomatosa (CLC), a rare condition that accounts for less than 5% of cutaneous metastases, also causes cervicofacial oedema,and patients with CLC usually present with progressive lymphoedema and erythema.Here, we report a rare case of lung adenocarcinoma with CLC and SVC stenosis in a patient whose cervicofacial oedema and dyspnoea remained despite improving SVC blood flow via balloon dilation.

### Thoracic lymphangitis as an immune-related adverse event: a case report [^8bf9ccd9]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 65-year-old woman developed postoperative chylothorax after undergoing left upper lobectomy with wedge bronchoplasty with ND2a-2 for left upper lobe lung cancer. Decreasing dietary fatty acids did not improve her condition; however, lymphangiography with lipiodol closed the leak. Thereafter, the patient was treated for p-stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer with tumor cell PD-L1 expression 20% (22C3) with four cycles of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy regimens of cisplatin and vinorelbine on the 59th day postsurgery. Computed tomography (CT) results were normal without recurrence (Fig. 1 A). Based on the IMpower010 trial, atezolizumab was administered. After day 9 of cycle 1, she developed fever in between grade 1 to 2. On day 15, she complained of breathlessness and her condition rapidly progressed to hypoxia grade 3. Chest CT conducted on the same day revealed significant lymphostasis mainly located in right lower lobe (Fig. 1 B–E). Occurrence of lymphangitis carcinomatosa, infectious diseases, and heart failure were ruled out. The patient was diagnosed with lymphangitis, an irAE, due to blockage of the thoracic duct by chylothorax treatment and activation of lymphocyte caused by ICI. Treatment with 1000 mg methylprednisolone was initiated on day 15. The chest X-ray showed complete improvement on day 8 of steroid treatment. The patient could discontinue taking steroids without experiencing recurrence.

Fig. 1 
A Computed tomography (CT) of chest showed normal post-operative findings. B Axial computed tomography (CT) showed severe lymphostasis. C Axial, (D) Coronal, and (E) Sagittal view of high-resolution chest CT showed severe lymphostasis

On day 15 after atezolizumab treatment, the patient also experienced acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy as an irAE, which was diagnosed by a neurologist, and intravenous injection of immunoglobulin were administered after steroid treatment. The symptoms of difficulty in walking and limbs dysesthesia gradually improved.

After administering a single dose of atezolizumab, the patient was observed without additional treatment, and the recurrence-free survival time for lung cancer was longer than one year.

### Molecular mechanisms of lymphangiogenesis in health and disease [^da6ac95c]. Cancer Cell (2002). Low credibility.

Studies of the last decades have revealed the importance of angiogenesis for normal growth and for the pathogenesis of numerous diseases. Much less studied is lymphangiogenesis, the growth of lymphatic vessels, which drain extravasated fluid, proteins, and cells and transport them back to the venous circulation. Nonetheless, insufficient lymphangiogenesis causes incapacitating lymphedema, while lymphatic growth around tumors may facilitate metastatic spread of malignant cells that ultimately kill the patient. The recent discovery of the key lymphangiogenic factors VEGF-C and VEGF-D and their receptor VEGFR-3 has allowed novel insights into how the lymphatic vessels and blood vessels coordinately grow and affect human disease. In addition, these studies have opened novel diagnostic and therapeutic avenues for the treatment of lymphedema and metastasis. This overview highlights the recent insights and developments in the field of lymphatic vascular research.

### Biomaterials in the clinical treatment of lymphedema-a systematic review [^ed7a54df]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Lymphedema is a chronic condition caused by impairment of lymphatic fluid drainage and results in progressive edema, chronic inflammation, soft tissue fibrosis, and recurrent cellulitis. Primary lymphedema is rare and is caused by genetic mutations that result in improper development of the lymphatic system, reducing its drainage capacity.Secondary lymphedema is more common, and although filariasis is its most common cause worldwide, its leading etiology in western countries is cancer-related therapy.

Conservative therapy is the mainstay approach in the treatment of lymphedema. It includes a variety of therapeutic modalities that range from general measures (eg, limb elevation, exercise, diet) to compression therapy (eg, compression garments, intermittent pneumatic compression) and physiotherapy (eg, manual lymphatic drainage [MLD], and complete decongestive therapy [CDT]).,,Although a conservative approach is considered the main pillar of treatment, its effect has been doubted in recent years. Surgical modalities can and should be proposed to treat the different stages of the disease.

Surgical therapies can use physiologic or reductive approaches.The first aims to restore physiologic lymphatic circulation by creating a shunt between high-pressure subcutaneous lymphatic vessels and low-pressure venules.The main procedures are lymphaticovenular anastomosis (LVA) and vascularized lymph node transplantation (VLNT). These procedures result in significant reductions in limb volume, especially when performed for early stage lymphedema, before the development of lymphatic sclerosis and soft tissue fibrosis and the deposition of excess fat.,,

A reductive approach is commonly used for late-stage lymphedema with the goal of removing the accumulated bulk of fibrofatty tissue.,,Excess tissue excision and liposuction are the principal procedures in this approach. These techniques result in long-term limb volume reduction, although compression therapy, CDT, and/or physiologic procedures are often necessary to maintain the results.,

### Cutaneous lymphangitis carcinomatosa made cervicofacial oedema intractable in a patient with superior vena cava syndrome [^980bbb79]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Cutaneous lymphangitis carcinomatosa (CLC) is a rare form of cutaneous metastasis that causes lymphoedema and various eruptions. We report a case of lung cancer with CLC that caused both superior vena cava (SVC) stenosis and cervicofacial oedema, suggestive of SVC syndrome. A 64-year-old woman with lung adenocarcinoma presented with cervicofacial oedema and erythema, followed by severe dyspnoea 2 months after four cycles of carboplatin, pemetrexed and bevacizumab triplet therapy. Although chest CT indicated SVC stenosis, cervicofacial oedema remained despite treating the SVC stenosis via balloon dilation. A skin biopsy of the erythematic sample confirmed CLC as the cause of the patient's symptoms. CLC should be considered as a differential diagnosis of cervicofacial oedema in addition to SVC syndrome, especially when it is observed in combination with skin erythema and induration. Moreover, a skin biopsy should be performed promptly for accurate diagnosis of CLC and to decide on appropriate treatment.

### Case report: palmar herpetic whitlow and forearm lymphangitis in a 10-year-old female [^2db5f340]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Herpetic whitlow is a viral infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 or 2, and occurs in the pediatric population primarily on the fingers and toes due to autoinoculation from oral secretions. Because of this cited prevalence, other locations of herpetic whitlow may go unrecognized.

Case Presentation

We present an atypical presentation of palmar herpetic whitlow with delayed recognition and associated viral lymphangitis. The patient presented as a transfer from an outside hospital with a progressive, three-day history of a suspected left hand abscess preceded by left hand pain and itching. She was initially evaluated by Orthopedic Surgery, who described an erythematous, edematous, tender, left palmar abscess with associated erythematous streaking up her forearm. The lesion was surgically managed with an incision and drainage. Wound cultures were obtained during which "minimal drainage" was noted. After admission to the General Pediatrics Hospital service, the lesion was noted to appear vesicular and subsequently obtained PCR samples were positive for HSV type 1, confirming her diagnosis of herpetic whitlow. Although she remained afebrile with negative wound cultures throughout her hospitalization, a secondary bacterial infection could not be conclusively excluded due to the accompanying lymphangitis. Thus, she was discharged with oral antibiotics and anticipatory guidance of potential recurrence of palmar lesions.

Conclusions

Herpetic whitlow should be included in the differential diagnosis of palmar lesions that appear vesicular or abscess-like to ensure appropriate treatment. Additionally, these palmar lesions may present with associated lymphangitis without evidence of bacterial infection.

### WSES / GAIS / WSIS / SIS-E / AAST global clinical pathways for patients with skin and soft tissue infections [^8ec32fa4]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis

Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection primarily of the dermal lymphatics and the subcutaneous tissue that most commonly affects the lower extremities, although it can affect other areas. It causes local signs of inflammation, such as warmth, erythema, pain, lymphangitis, and frequently systemic upset impact with fever and raised white blood cell count. Outpatient therapy should be recommended for patients with adherence to therapy, who do not have general signs of inflammation or hemodynamic instability.

Patients with a previous attack of cellulitis, especially involving the legs, can present recurrences. The infection usually occurs in the same area as the previous episode. edema, especially lymphedema, venous insufficiency, prior trauma (including surgery) to the area, and tinea pedis can increase the frequency of recurrences. Addressing these factors may decrease the frequency of recurrences.

The pathogens involved are streptococci and S. aureus. Cellulitis associated with abscesses is usually caused by S. aureus. In contrast, typical (non-purulent) cellulitis is most commonly caused by both streptococcal species and S. aureus. MRSA is an unusual cause of typical cellulitis.

In neutropenic and immunocompromised patients, Gram-negative bacteria should be considered.

Treatment 
Antibiotic therapy for 5 days. You may extend therapy up to 7-10 days if lack of symptom resolution at 5 days.

### Incidence, treatment costs, and complications of lymphedema after breast cancer among women of working age: a 2-year follow-up study [^ef3ab8f0]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study estimated the economic burden of breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) among working-age women, the incidence of lymphedema, and associated risk factors.

Methods

We used claims data to study an incident cohort of breast cancer patients for the 2 years after the initiation of cancer treatment. A logistic regression model was used to ascertain factors associated with lymphedema. We compared the medical costs and rate of infections likely associated with lymphedema between a woman with BCRL and a matched control. We performed nonparametric bootstrapping to compare the unadjusted cost differences and estimated the adjusted cost differences in regression analysis.

Results

Approximately 10% of the 1,877 patients had claims indicating treatment of lymphedema. Predictors included treatment with full axillary node dissection (odds ratio [OR] = 6.3, P < .001) and chemotherapy (OR = 1.6, P = .01). A geographic variation was observed; women who resided in the West were more likely to have lymphedema claims than those in the Northeast (OR = 2.05, P = .01). The matched cohort analysis demonstrated that the BCRL group had significantly higher medical costs ($14,877 to $23,167) and was twice as likely to have lymphangitis or cellulitis (OR = 2.02, P = .009). Outpatient care, especially mental health services, diagnostic imaging, and visits with moderate or high complexity, accounted for the majority of the difference.

Conclusion

Although the use of claims data may underestimate the true incidence of lymphedema, women with BCRL had a greater risk of infections and incurred higher medical costs. The substantial costs documented here suggest that further efforts should be made to elucidate reduction and prevention strategies for BCRL.

For optimizing treatment, it is important to understand the progressive changes of filarial lymphedema over time, from when the adult worm first takes up residence in the afferent lymphatic vessels of the lymph nodes, to the enlargement of the involved lymphatics, to the inflammatory changes associated with the presence of the adult worms and their secretions, and to the subsequent accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the associated interstitial connective tissues (Figure 2). These events are associated with progressive degeneration in the skin’s normal homeostatic and protective function, opening opportunities for the establishment of secondary bacterial and fungal infections with additional associated gross pathological changes. Indeed, it is these secondary infections, along with a compromised lymphatic system, that drive progression of lymphedema even in the absence of persistent filarial infection; this is particularly important because most lymphedema patients do become free of active filarial infection over time. Presumably, such individuals have built up a higher level of inflammatory immune responsiveness, which is effective at warding off new incoming filarial infectious larvae (the L3s), but at the cost of local inflammation that ultimately drives further vessel enlargement and worsening lymphatic function. Many studies have characterized the different immune profiles between lymphedema patients and those who have ongoing infection (microfilaremia) but without overt disease, ; these observations suggest a significantly elevated pro-inflammatory immune response in patients with lymphedema compared with those without. Such a view of the pathogenesis of filarial lymphedemais useful both for providing appropriate care, independent of filarial infection status, and for understanding the pathological elements that might be targeted in investigations aimed at improving care, both before and after filariasis transmission has stopped in affected communities.

### Complex lymphatic anomalies and therapeutic options [^91c3d455]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Complex lymphatic anomalies include a variety of disorders with overlapping clinical, histological and imaging features. The often-confusing nomenclature used for lymphatic anomalies limits timely diagnosis and treatment. The updated 2018 classification of the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies divides lymphatic anomalies into several subsets. 1 Newer imaging techniques including intranodal and magnetic resonance lymphangiography have improved our understanding of anatomy and function of the lymphatic system. Advances in medical, interventional, and surgical treatments have opened a realm of new therapeutic options for patients with complex lymphatic disorders.

### Current understanding of pathological mechanisms of lymphedema [^b680ec10]. Advances in Wound Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Significance: Lymphedema is a common disease that affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide with significant financial and social burdens. Despite increasing prevalence and associated morbidities, the mainstay treatment of lymphedema is largely palliative without an effective cure due to incomplete understanding of the disease. Recent Advances: Recent studies have described key histological and pathological processes that contribute to the progression of lymphedema, including lymphatic stasis, inflammation, adipose tissue deposition, and fibrosis. This review aims to highlight cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in each of these pathological processes. Critical Issues: Despite recent advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of lymphedema, cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the disease remains elusive due to its complex nature. Future Directions: Additional research is needed to gain a better insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of lymphedema, which will guide the development of therapeutic strategies that target specific pathology of the disease.

### Development and evaluation of a molecular diagnostic method for rapid detection of histoplasma capsulatum var. farciminosum, the causative agent of epizootic lymphangitis, in equine clinical samples [^f299df68]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Within regions where the disease is endemic, access to treatment is a significant challenge. The Society for the Protection of Animals Abroad (SPANA) currently provides free veterinary care within its clinics; however, topical treatment with tincture of iodine and oral dosing with potassium iodides are labor intensive, expensive, and of limited efficacy in moderate to severe cases of EZL. It is imperative that animals be diagnosed early in the course of the disease to improve treatment outcomes, conserve resources, and reduce the burden of infection within the population. Currently, due to limited available diagnostic technologies, veterinarians in Ethiopia diagnose the disease on the basis of clinical appearance and microscopic examination for yeast cells within pus. This has the potential for misdiagnosis, as the clinical appearance can mimic that of other diseases (e.g. ulcerative lymphangitis, sporotrichosis, and the cutaneous form of glanders). Culture ofvar.from clinical lesions would be definitive but is challenging and rarely attempted. Therefore, reliable and robust approaches to diagnosis are required to support clinical decision making and enable epidemiological studies to provide the rationale for the development of disease prevention strategies. EZL has recently been highlighted to be a priority neglected disease of working equids.

### Is lymphangitic streaking associated with different pathogens? [^aa41f09e]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Little is known regarding the differences in microbiology associated with cellulitis or abscess with or without lymphangitic streaking. The objective of our study is to assess whether there are differences in the pathogens identified from wound cultures of patients with paronychia with and without associated lymphangitis.

Methods

Retrospective cross-sectional study at a tertiary pediatric emergency department over 25 years. We opted to assess patients with paronychia of the finger, assuming that these cases will have a greater variety of causative pathogens compared to other cases of cellulitis and soft tissue abscess that are associated with nail biting. Case identification was conducted using a computerized text-screening search that was refined by manual chart review. We included patients from 1 month to 20 years of age who underwent an incision and drainage (I&D) of a paronychia and had a culture obtained. The presence or absence of lymphangitis was determined from the clinical narrative in the medical record. We excluded patients treated with antibiotics prior to I&D as well as immune-compromised patients. We used descriptive statistics for prevalence and χ2 tests for categorical variables.

Results

Two hundred sixty-six patients met inclusion criteria. The median age was 9.7 years [IQR 4.7, 15.4] and 45.1% were female. Twenty-two patients (8.3%) had lymphangitic streaking associated with their paronychia. Patients with lymphangitis streaking were similar to those without lymphangitis in terms of age and sex (p = 0.52 and p = 0.82, respectively). Overall, the predominant bacteria was MSSA (40%) followed by MRSA (26%). No significant differences were found between the pathogens in the 22 patients with associated lymphangitis compared to the 244 patients without.

Conclusion

Staphylococcus aureus represent the majority of pathogens in paronychia, although streptococcal species and gram-negative bacteria were also common. Among patients with paronychia of the finger, there seems to be no association between pathogen type and presence of lymphangitic streaking.

### Primary lymphoedema [^12a14488]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2021). High credibility.

Lymphoedema is the swelling of one or several parts of the body owing to lymph accumulation in the extracellular space. It is often chronic, worsens if untreated, predisposes to infections and causes an important reduction in quality of life. Primary lymphoedema (PLE) is thought to result from abnormal development and/or functioning of the lymphatic system, can present in isolation or as part of a syndrome, and can be present at birth or develop later in life. Mutations in numerous genes involved in the initial formation of lymphatic vessels (including valves) as well as in the growth and expansion of the lymphatic system and associated pathways have been identified in syndromic and non-syndromic forms of PLE. Thus, the current hypothesis is that most cases of PLE have a genetic origin, although a causative mutation is identified in only about one-third of affected individuals. Diagnosis relies on clinical presentation, imaging of the structure and functionality of the lymphatics, and in genetic analyses. Management aims at reducing or preventing swelling by compression therapy (with manual drainage, exercise and compressive garments) and, in carefully selected cases, by various surgical techniques. Individuals with PLE often have a reduced quality of life owing to the psychosocial and lifelong management burden associated with their chronic condition. Improved understanding of the underlying genetic origins of PLE will translate into more accurate diagnosis and prognosis and personalized treatment.

### Fishy story: paradoxical reaction associated with... [^7e3d736d]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Paradoxical reactions occur when an infection has acute worsening in response to antibiotic therapy. Here, we describe a patient with chronic cutaneous ulcerative lymphangitis that acutely worsened following initiation of antibiotic therapy. The infection was caused by Mycobacterium marinum , a species which has not previously been associated with paradoxical reaction in immunocompetent persons. In this case report, we describe our patient's diagnosis and management, review the management of Mycobacterium marinum infection, and discuss paradoxical reactions in mycobacterial disease.

### Diagnosis and management of lymphatic vascular disease [^b7a5bbc5]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

The lymphatic vasculature is comprised of a network of vessels that is essential both to fluid homeostasis and to the mediation of regional immune responses. In health, the lymphatic vasculature possesses the requisite transport capacity to accommodate the fluid load placed upon it. The most readily recognizable attribute of lymphatic vascular incompetence is the presence of the characteristic swelling of tissues, called lymphedema, which arises as a consequence of insufficient lymph transport. The diagnosis of lymphatic vascular disease relies heavily upon the physical examination. If the diagnosis remains in question, the presence of lymphatic vascular insufficiency can be ascertained through imaging, including indirect radionuclide lymphoscintigraphy. Beyond lymphoscintigraphy, clinically-relevant imaging modalities include magnetic resonance imaging and computerized axial tomography. The state-of-the-art therapeutic approach to lymphatic edema relies upon physiotherapeutic techniques. Complex decongestive physiotherapy is an empirically-derived, effective, multicomponent technique designed to reduce limb volume and maintain the health of the skin and supporting structures. The application of pharmacological therapies has been notably absent from the management strategies for lymphatic vascular insufficiency states. In general, drug-based approaches have been controversial at best. Surgical approaches to improve lymphatic flow through vascular reanastomosis have been, in large part, unsuccessful, but controlled liposuction affords lasting benefit in selected patients. In the future, specifically engineered molecular therapeutics may be designed to facilitate the controlled regrowth of damaged, dysfunctional, or obliterated lymphatic vasculature in order to circumvent or mitigate the vascular insufficiency that leads to edema and tissue destruction.

### Lymphoedema management to prevent acute dermatolymphangioadenitis in podoconiosis in Northern Ethiopia (GoLBeT): a pragmatic randomised controlled trial [^a9af3337]. The Lancet: Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Added value of this study

To our knowledge, this is the first randomised controlled trial to measure the effects of a lymphoedema management package on the most important consequence of podoconiosis, acute attacks of dermatolymphangioadenitis. Our study showed that pragmatic trials can be done in challenging, low-resource settings with high rates of follow-up, and that acute attacks are more frequent among untreated patients than previously thought.

Implications of all the available evidence

Simple limb hygiene and foot care measures are effective in preventing acute dermatolymphangioadenitis in podoconiosis lymphoedema. These findings are likely to inform guidelines for elimination of podoconiosis in endemic countries.

Although rarely a direct cause of mortality, podoconiosis disables an estimated 4 million subsistence farmers in tropical Africa; this disease reduces productivityand leads to substantial stigmatisation by the community,,and by health professionals,low quality of life,and depression.Episodes of acute dermatolymphangioadenitis are among the most severe clinical consequences of lymphoedema. The causes of acute dermatolymphangioadenitis among patients with podoconiosis are likely to be similar to its causes among patients with other types of lymphoedema, such as filarial or post-surgical lymphoedema. Episodes of acute dermatolymphangioadenitis are characterised by malaise, fever, chills, diffuse inflammation, swelling of the limbs, lymphangitis, adenitis and, eventually, skin peeling.These episodes are known locally as “michader”. They occur frequently (reports vary from five to 23 episodes per year), and contribute substantially to the disability and social effects associated with podoconiosis.,Antibiotic therapy (including penicillin), which has been recommended for interruption of acute dermatolymphangioadenitis episodes,is not routinely available for patients in remote rural populations in Ethiopia. Despite the high impact of podoconiosis on rural farming communities, treatment and control of podoconiosis have been hampered by misdiagnosis (chiefly, confusion with filarial lymphoedema) and fatalism.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^234e3dce]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Infected animal bite–related wounds—treatment recommendations and options: An antimicrobial agent or agents active against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria such as amoxicillin-clavulanate (Table 5) should be used (strong, moderate). Purulent bite wounds and abscesses are more likely to be polymicrobial, whereas nonpurulent wounds commonly yield staphylococci and streptococci, and Pasteurella species are commonly isolated from both nonpurulent wounds with or without lymphangitis and from abscesses; nonpurulent wound infections may also be polymicrobial. Based on this bacteriology, amoxicillin-clavulanate is appropriate oral therapy that covers the most likely aerobes and anaerobes found in bite wounds. Alternative therapies could include second-generation cephalosporins (intravenously [IV] or by mouth [po]) (eg, cefuroxime), other second- or third-generation cephalosporins, plus anaerobic coverage (clindamycin or metronidazole) if required; a carbapenem, moxifloxacin, or doxycycline is also appropriate. If SMX-TMP or levofloxacin is used, anaerobic coverage with either clindamycin or metronidazole should be added. Unless no alternative agents are available, macrolides should be avoided due to variable activity against Pasteurella multocida and fusobacteria. Pregnancy is a relative contraindication for use of tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones, whereas SMX-TMP may be safely prescribed except in the third trimester of pregnancy.

### Hand dermatitis and lymphoedema [^956f5497]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Hand dermatitis is common, with lymphoedema of the hand and forearm a rare complication. The mechanism of lymphoedema in such cases is poorly understood, hence management can be challenging. To investigate the underlying mechanism of lymphoedema associated with hand dermatitis and outline recommendations for management, we identified all patients with lymphoedema associated with hand dermatitis referred to our lymphoedema service, a tertiary referral centre. Treatment outcome was assessed by telephone interview and through correspondence with primary physicians and therapists. In total, nine patients, six with bilateral and three with unilateral lymphoedema associated with hand dermatitis, attended our service over a 4-year period. Most had long-standing bilateral pompholyx eczema. Three patients reported no signs of infection prior to the onset of swelling. All patients had recurrent episodes of infection after the onset of swelling. Lymphoscintigraphy, when used, revealed a failure of small initial lymphatics of the hand to absorb and drain lymph to regional nodes. Prophylactic antibiotics together with aggressive management of the dermatitis, often with systemic therapy, were required to reduce swelling. Possible mechanisms for lymphoedema associated with hand dermatitis include obliterative lymphangitis from infection, an inflammatory effect of the dermatitis on local lymphatics or a constitutive weakness of lymph drainage exposed to chronic inflammation, or any combination of the three. Treatment is only successful once both infection and inflammation from the dermatitis are controlled.

### Lymphangiectasias of the skin: victims of confusing nomenclature [^cf9f9ed3]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Lymphangiectasias are known by a variety of names, in the dermatology literature, including lymphangiectasis, acquired lymphangiomas, secondary lymphangiomas and acquired lymphangioma circumscriptum, which has led to confusion. The condition itself, especially in the genital region, is difficult to diagnose. This article attempts to resolve the issues of the confusing nomenclature and reviews the condition, which can arise under a variety of clinical circumstances. The relevant anatomical and histological details are described, with relevant clinical illustrations, to facilitate understanding of the aetiopathogenesis of this enigmatic condition. The available medical and non-medical treatments are discussed.

A 70-year-old woman with lung metastases from a breast cancer presented with worsening cough and dyspnoea. She recently had a pleurodesis for a malignant pleural effusion. Chest CT scans demonstrated various radiological changes leading to diagnostic challenges. Differential diagnoses included empyema, pleural disease progression, pulmonary oedema, pneumonitis, lymphangitis and atypical infections. She deteriorated despite a multimodality treatment strategy. Postmortem examination confirmed that lung changes were consistent with a bronchoalveolar carcinoma unrelated to the known metastatic breast cancer. The eventual knowledge of this diagnosis was reassuring to the treating medical team and a comfort to the relatives who witnessed the lack of response to standard treatment.

### Back to the future II – A comprehensive update on the rapidly evolving field of lymphatic imaging and interventions [^cbdd68cd]. Investigative Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Lymphatic imaging and interventional therapies of disorders affecting the lymphatic vascular system have evolved rapidly in recent years. Although x-ray lymphangiography had been all but replaced by the advent of cross-sectional imaging and the scientific focus shifted to lymph node imaging (eg, for detection of metastatic disease), interest in lymph vessel imaging was rekindled by the introduction of lymphatic interventional treatments in the late 1990s. Although x-ray lymphangiography is still the mainstay imaging technique to guide interventional procedures, several other, often less invasive, techniques have been developed more recently to evaluate the lymphatic vascular system and associated pathologies. Especially the introduction of magnetic resonance, and even more recently computed tomography, lymphangiography with water-soluble iodinated contrast agent has furthered our understanding of complex pathophysiological backgrounds of lymphatic diseases. This has led to an improvement of treatment approaches, especially of nontraumatic disorders caused by lymphatic flow abnormalities including plastic bronchitis, protein-losing enteropathy, and nontraumatic chylolymphatic leakages. The therapeutic armamentarium has also constantly grown and diversified in recent years with the introduction of more complex catheter-based and interstitial embolization techniques, lymph vessel stenting, lymphovenous anastomoses, as well as (targeted) medical treatment options. The aim of this article is to review the relevant spectrum of lymphatic disorders with currently available radiological imaging and interventional techniques, as well as the application of these methods in specific, individual clinical situations.

### Cutaneous lymphangitis carcinomatosa made cervicofacial oedema intractable in a patient with superior vena cava syndrome [^9f215d4c]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We reported a case of lung adenocarcinoma with a combination of CLC and SVC stenosis, which presented with cervicofacial oedema and dyspnoea. Balloon dilation failed to improve these symptoms, which suggests that CLC made the symptoms caused by SVC syndrome more intractable.

In the present case, when the patient presented with swelling and erythema of the neck and chest collateral veins and dyspnoea, CT revealed SVC stenosis. This disease course is typical of SVC syndrome, which was the main cause of the symptoms. SVC syndrome arises from the compression of thin-walled SVC by enlarged paratracheal lymph nodes, mostly caused by lung cancer.The common symptoms of SVC syndrome include neck swelling, dyspnoea, facial swelling, cough and dilated chest collateral veins.Contrast-enhanced CT may elucidate the cause and extent of venous obstruction in SVC syndrome. The initial treatment in emergent cases of SVC syndrome is endovascular stenting of the SVC to restore flow. SVC stenting is reported to improve symptoms of SVC syndrome within 1–3 days, and recurrence rarely occurs.In the present case, SVC blood flow remained despite its prominent stenosis, and symptoms improved for only a few hours. The rapid recurrence of symptoms is atypical for SVC syndrome and indicates that there were other causes that made the patient’s symptoms more intractable.

Lymphedema evaluation—swelling quantification and AFTD-pitting test emphasize objective measurement at baseline and follow up and describe a consensus tool with a duration threshold. The page states that to evaluate treatment one “has to be able to quantify the amount of swelling at initial visit and during follow up,” and because swelling is the presenting symptom it is “important to have an objective measure of initial swelling… and progressively evaluate whether the treatment reduces swelling.” Practicality and standardization concerns are noted, yet a consensus “advocated the use of the AFTD-pitting test… using edema of >3 months duration as a surrogate for lymphedema,” although “low inter-observer reliability was reported in another cohort with milder lymphedema.” For diagnostic confidence in early disease, “some of the experts consider additional assessment such as limb volume, physiologic changes, or lymphatic imaging necessary to make a confident diagnosis of Stage 0 and 1 lymphedema,” and “Patients want to have confidence in their diagnosis… some are interested” in imaging to increase diagnostic confidence.

### Lymphangitis in a Portuguese patient infected with Rickettsia sibirica [^743bb03a]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

To the Editor : We report a case of Rickettsia sibirica mongolitimoniae strain infection associated with lymphangitis. A 44-year-old man was admitted to São Bernardo Hospital in Setubal, Portugal, on August 21, 2006. Twelve days previously while on vacation at Troia Peninsula, he noted malaise, insomnia, and dry buccal mucosa. The next day he observed a small erythematous pruritic lesion on the lower right forearm that 2 days later developed into an eschar. He also had fever and sought medical care. After treatment with topical bacitracin, floxacillin, and acetaminophen for 2 days, fever (38.7°C) continued with lymphangitis extending from the right wrist to the elbow. The medication was changed to nimesulide. Three days later a rash developed on the trunk and arms, and lymphangitis extended to the axilla. Fever and chills continued, leading to hospital admission. No history of tick exposure was reported. Physical examination showed blood pressure 128/73 mm Hg, pulse 96/min, and a rubbery, nontender right supraclavicular lymph node ≈1 cm in diameter. Several 5- to 10-mm maculopapular erythematous lesions were observed on the patient’s palms. He had inflammation on the right forearm suggestive of lymphangitis and an eschar with surrounding edema and erythema on the dorsal lower right forearm (Figure). Admission evaluation showed platelets 117,000/μL, total bilirubin 0.42 mg/dL, albumin 3.42 g/dL, creatinine 1.1 mg/dL, alanine aminotransferase 244 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 54 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 1061 U/L, creatine phosphokinase 87 U/dL, lactate dehydrogenase 784 U/L, C-reactive protein 7.1 mg/dL, radiographic pulmonary diffuse reticular pattern, arterial pO 2 68 mm Hg, O 2 saturation 94%, pCO 2 22 mm Hg, and arterial blood pH 7.35. The differential diagnoses included rickettsiosis, pneumonia, and cellulitis. Treatment with vancomycin, cefatriaxone, and 100 mg of doxycycline twice a day was begun. On the day after hospitalization, a heparinized blood sample and 2 skin biopsy samples were collected. Vancomycin and ceftriaxone were discontinued at 48 hours when rickettsial infection was confirmed by PCR on skin biopsy; 48 hours later, the patient was afebrile.

### Current concepts in surgical management of lymphedema [^0169d4a8]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

The decision on whom to offer surgical interventions for lymphedema requires collaboration and input from all involved specialists and should address patients' expectations, invasiveness of procedures, and disease severity. There is no consensus on what constitutes success or failure of complex decongestive therapy and when to pursue surgical intervention. Surgery has the potential to fundamentally affect the pathophysiology of the disease state and can be a powerful tool when used correctly. The dogma of which surgery to offer for a given clinical situation has been undergoing revision and is an area of ongoing research.

### Effect of adding a six-week course of doxycycline to intensive hygiene-based care for improving lymphedema in a rural setting of Mali: a double-blind, randomized controlled 24-month trial [^2598d273]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT.

Lymphedema (LE) is one the most disfiguring chronic manifestations of lymphatic filariasis. Its management relies primarily on limb hygiene and local care. A previous study in Ghana demonstrating a beneficial effect of doxycycline on LE led to the current multicenter trial on the efficacy of doxycycline in filarial LE. A randomized placebo-controlled trial was initiated in two rural health districts in Mali. Patients with LE stages 1–3 were randomized to receive either doxycycline (200 mg/day) or placebo over a 6-week monitored treatment period and were then followed every 6 months for 2 years. Both groups received materials for limb hygiene that was carried out daily for the entire 2-year study. The primary endpoint was lack of progression in LE stage at 24 months. One hundred patients were enrolled in each study arm. The baseline sociodemographic characteristics of each group were largely similar. There was no significant difference at month 24 after treatment initiation in the number of subjects showing progression in LE stage between the two treatment arms (P = 0.5921). Importantly, however, the number of attacks of acute adenolymphangitis (ADLA) was reduced in both arms, but there was no significant difference between the two groups at any follow-up time point (all P >0.23). Doxycycline was well tolerated in those receiving the drug. When added to daily self-administered limb hygiene, a 6-week course of doxycycline (200 mg) was not superior to placebo in increasing the improvement associated with hygiene alone in LE volume, stage, or frequency of ADLA attacks over a 24-month period.

### Current treatment paradigms in the management of lymphatic malformations [^820475ce]. The Laryngoscope (2011). Low credibility.

Lymphatic malformations (LMs) are benign abnormalities of the lymphatic system that can be significantly infiltrative and intimately involve critical structures of the head and neck, making their management difficult. Historically, LMs have been managed by surgical excision, but this treatment approach results in significant morbidity and a high recurrence rate secondary to subtotal resection. As an alternative to surgery a variety of drugs have been used as intralesional sclerosants and immunotherapeutics. These agents offer improved outcomes with lower morbidity as compared to surgery when targeted to macrocystic LMs. However intralesional therapy is not effective in the treatment of microcystic LMs. The development of treatments that are effective for all types of LMs will require further understanding of lymphangiogenesis and the pathogenesis of LMs.

Lymphedema imaging—radionuclide lymphoscintigraphy consensus: Radionuclide lymphoscintigraphy should be recommended for patients with suspected or diagnosed lymphedema; however, agreement was only 42%, below the 70% threshold for consensus, with 58% disagreeing and 7% strongly disagreeing, largely because it is impractical/unavailable in most places and results do not change patient management.

### How we approach pediatric congenital chylous effusions and ascites [^ee447d5b]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Congenital lymphatic leak may develop in patients with maldeveloped lymphatics and result in life-threatening fluid and electrolyte imbalance, protein deficiency, and immunodeficiency. Rapid diagnosis and therapy are necessary to prevent these complications; however, the field lacks clinical trials to support standardized diagnostic treatment guidelines. We present our current multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of congenital lymphatic leak including chylous pleural effusions and ascites. Depending on the rate of lymphatic leak, therapy can range from observation with nutritional modifications to surgical and interventional procedures aimed to reduce lymphatic drainage. Modalities to image central and peripheral lymphatics have advanced considerably. Genetic variants and subsequent targets that drive lymphatic maldevelopment have expanded the repertoire of possible pharmacotherapeutic options.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^7ae6ae84]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the dermis and the subcutaneous tissue that most commonly affects the lower extremities, although it can affect other areas. It causes local signs of inflammation, such as warmth, erythema, pain, lymphangitis, and frequently systemic upset with fever and raised white blood cell count. As already reported in a previous paragraph, cellulitis has been recently classified as an ABSSSI together with erysipelas, SSIs, and major abscesses.

In a large European multicenter study, Garau et al. analyzed a population of patients diagnosed with complicated SSTI hospitalized between December 2010 and January 2011 reporting that cellulitis was the most frequent diagnosis accounting for 59.1% of the total. Streptococci cause diffuse, rapidly spreading infection; staphylococcal cellulitis is typically more localized.

Treatment should begin promptly with agents effective against the typical Gram-positive pathogens, especially streptococci. If the cellulitis is very early and mild and no significant co-morbidities are present, oral beta-lactams might be sufficient in areas where CA-MRSA is not prevalent. Other available options are macrolides and lincosamides; however, resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin are increasing. Fluoroquinolones have been approved for the treatment of most uncomplicated cellulitis but are not adequate for treatment of MRSA infections. For more severe infections, parenteral route is the first choice.

If MRSA is suspected (both hospital acquired MRSA [HA-MRSA] and CA-MRSA), glycopeptides and newer antimicrobials are the best options. For a simple superficial abscess or boil, incision and drainage is the primary treatment, and antibiotics are not needed. To be considered a simple abscess, induration and erythema should be limited only to a defined area of the abscess and should not extend beyond its borders. Additionally, simple abscesses do not extend into deeper tissues or have multiloculated extension. Cutaneous abscesses are typically caused by bacteria that represent the normal regional skin flora of the involved area.

### Managing lymphedema induced by lymphatic filariasis: implementing and improving care at the individual and programmatic levels [^0b0dbc83]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

UNDERSTANDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF FILARIAL LYMPHEDEMA

The underlying cellular, tissue, and organ changes associated with filarial lymphedema are still not well understood, and much of the knowledge we have of the pathogenesis in humans is inferred from experimental animal models, from patients evaluated with noninvasive imaging techniques (lymphoscintigraphy and ultrasonography), from hematology/serology testing, or from the relatively infrequently available biopsy material from surgical interventions. The direct presence of living parasites alters local tissue responses, especially in the early stages of infection, as emphasized by the informative studies of Shenoy et al.and Douglass et al.who demonstrated clearly that the early-stage lymphatic pathology found in children with active filarial infections can be reversed by MDA drugs that remove the offending parasites. Similarly, experimental models, such as those of Brugia infections in catsand dogs,have shown many similarities with pathogenic findings in humans and have emphasized the interacting roles of the parasite, inflammation, and other cellular responses in early disease. Indeed, it is highly likely that the condition now recognized as filariasis-induced lymphedema involves a multifaceted complex of factors that affect both its pathogenesis and its treatment. Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately!), it can be argued that the full range of mechanisms and components involved may never be fully elucidated because of the current, very successful efforts to reduce LF infection intensity and distribution worldwide.However, it still needs to be remembered that many of the lymphedema cases that already exist will continue to require care and thus will serve as a catalyst for finding new, improved treatments.

Toxicity

Treatment-related toxicities are shown in Table 3. Grade 2 or greater acute dermatologic toxicity was seen in 36 (92%) patients. No patients developed acute or late grade 3-4 GI or GU toxicities. All acute and late GI toxicity and lymphangitis occurred in patients receiving IMRT to both the vulva and regional lymph nodes. Of the 14 patients who received concurrent chemotherapy, 5 (36%) developed acute grade 2 leukopenia and 3 (21%) developed acute grade 2 anemia. There were no acute grade 3-4 hematologic toxicities. In regard to late skin toxicity, 2 (5%) patients developed lymphangitis, and no patients had vulvar necrosis or nonhealing ulceration. One death occurred while a patient was receiving definitive chemoradiation therapy for a cT3N2M0, 9-cm vulvar squamous cell carcinoma with rectal and anal involvement. Weekly concurrent cisplatin and daily IMRT was stopped at 4800 cGy (planned, 6080 cGy) after the patient developed a rectovaginal fistula. She received a diverting colostomy 3 days after her last IMRT fraction. Unfortunately, she developed sepsis and died postoperatively.

### Economic costs and benefits of a community-based lymphedema management program for lymphatic filariasis in odisha state, India [^5e2d9c55]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2016). Low credibility.

Lymphatic filariasis afflicts 68 million people in 73 countries, including 17 million persons living with chronic lymphedema. The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis aims to stop new infections and to provide care for persons already affected, but morbidity management programs have been initiated in only 24 endemic countries. We examine the economic costs and benefits of alleviating chronic lymphedema and its effects through a simple limb-care program. For Khurda District, Odisha State, India, we estimated lifetime medical costs and earnings losses due to chronic lymphedema and acute dermatolymphangioadenitis (ADLA) with and without a community-based limb-care program. The program would reduce economic costs of lymphedema and ADLA over 60 years by 55%. Savings of US$1,648 for each affected person in the workforce are equivalent to 1,258 days of labor. Per-person savings are more than 130 times the per-person cost of the program. Chronic lymphedema and ADLA impose a substantial physical and economic burden on the population in filariasis-endemic areas. Low-cost programs for lymphedema management based on limb washing and topical medication for infection are effective in reducing the number of ADLA episodes and stopping progression of disabling and disfiguring lymphedema. With reduced disability, people are able to work longer hours, more days per year, and in more strenuous, higher-paying jobs, resulting in an important economic benefit to themselves, their families, and their communities. Mitigating the severity of lymphedema and ADLA also reduces out-of-pocket medical expense.

### Effect of adding a six-week course of doxycycline to intensive hygiene-based care for improving lymphedema in a rural setting of Mali: a double-blind, randomized controlled 24-month trial [^5ac4ac1e]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

Lymphedema (LE) is one the most disfiguring chronic manifestations of lymphatic filariasis. Its management relies primarily on limb hygiene and local care. A previous study in Ghana demonstrating a beneficial effect of doxycycline on LE led to the current multicenter trial on the efficacy of doxycycline in filarial LE. A randomized placebo-controlled trial was initiated in two rural health districts in Mali. Patients with LE stages 1-3 were randomized to receive either doxycycline (200 mg/day) or placebo over a 6-week monitored treatment period and were then followed every 6 months for 2 years. Both groups received materials for limb hygiene that was carried out daily for the entire 2-year study. The primary endpoint was lack of progression in LE stage at 24 months. One hundred patients were enrolled in each study arm. The baseline sociodemographic characteristics of each group were largely similar. There was no significant difference at month 24 after treatment initiation in the number of subjects showing progression in LE stage between the two treatment arms (P = 0.5921). Importantly, however, the number of attacks of acute adenolymphangitis (ADLA) was reduced in both arms, but there was no significant difference between the two groups at any follow-up time point (all P >0.23). Doxycycline was well tolerated in those receiving the drug. When added to daily self-administered limb hygiene, a 6-week course of doxycycline (200 mg) was not superior to placebo in increasing the improvement associated with hygiene alone in LE volume, stage, or frequency of ADLA attacks over a 24-month period.

### Immunohistochemical clues to the diagnosis of mondor's disease of the penis [^01215ed3]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Mondor's disease of the penis is usually a benign, self-limiting process of acute onset. To date, there have been few studies about its diagnosis and treatment. It is difficult to differentiate MD of the penis from sclerosing lymphangitis of the penis, because the symptoms, epidemiology and aetiology are similar, and because veins are histologically very similar to lymphatics. We report a case of MD in which immunochemical markers such as CD31 and D240 allowed us to specifically discriminate between the small vein and lymphatic vessels. This is important not only for the recognition of MD at any site, but for many other diseases in which veins or lymphatic vessels are affected.

Conclusions

ILAG has a high technical success rate and as an initial therapeutic technique can lead to closure of even large volume lymphatic leaks refractory to conservative and medical management. Additional lymphatic embolisation further improves clinical success. The authors suggest that in patients with a technically successful ILAG, a strategy of watchful waiting should be adopted for approximately 1–2 weeks, if clinically appropriate, and more invasive procedures, such as embolisation, can be considered for refractory cases.

The role of secondary infections.

The lymphatic system is important in removing organisms (principally bacteria or fungi) that enter the body. Where there is lymphatic dysfunction, such organisms tend to remain in the static lymph fluid, grow in this supportive medium, and likely contribute to acute attacks. Entry lesions (wounds, lacerations, paronychia) and interdigital fungal infections are very common in patients with lymphedema, where the digits are often swollen, thereby reducing the interdigital space and encouraging moisture to persist, often facilitating fungal infections. Such infections are associated with pruritus, and the patient’s action of scratching with their fingernails or rubbing on rough surfaces can lead to entry lesions and their consequences. Moisture, as a factor that encourages fungal infections, is likely to contribute to the increase in co-infections reported during the rainy seasons in many areas where patients commonly wade through water; these patients frequently suffer recurrent episodes of acute attacks. Open wounds, which allow entry of secondary-infection organisms, are an important pathogenic factor in lymphedema, but there are few direct studies on the microbiological profiles of open wounds in LF lymphedema. Earlier assessment of anti-streptolysin O titers as a surrogate marker for streptococcal infection in patients with acute ADL found that these titers were persistently elevated in 90% of patients with wounds, a finding consistent at least with the notion that these wounds could have been portals of entry for Streptococcus.

A seemingly fertile area of interest shaping the understanding and development of new treatment strategies in other medical fields is the difference in the microbiomes (biofilms) of an organ in health and disease. Differences in the dermal microbiome between normal and lymphedematous limbs have yet to be fully defined;however, when addressing questions of the microbial environment’s influence on lymphedema and, importantly, when selecting antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents for treatment, it is important to be cognizant of the environment in which the patient lives, works, and has other potential microbiological exposures. Recently, a study of the microbiome in the related lymphedema condition due to podoconiosis suggested a positive correlation between increasing lymphedema severity and noncommensal anaerobic bacteria (especially Anaerococcus provencensis) and a negative correlation with the presence of Corynebacterium, a constituent of normal skin flora.It remains to be seen which (if any) of the species identified plays a role in skin pathology or might even be found in patients’ blood during an acute attack.

Connections Among Interstitial Edema, Immune Responses, and Lymphangiogenesis: Lessons Learned From the Skin

As indicated above, interstitial edema contributes to tissue fibrosis, which reinforces sluggish or rerouted interstitial flow. In skin, lymphedema and accompanying fibrosis are also associated with elevated infiltrated immune cells including macrophages and lymphocytes,,. At least in some scenarios, the inhibition of cyclooxygenase 2 reduces the severity of lymphedema, suggesting the potential role of inflammation in maintaining lymphedema. Stimulation of lymphangiogenesis, again at least in some settings, can act effectively to inhibit chronic skin inflammation and immune cell accumulation and increase lymphatic drainage,. However, whether lymphangiogenesis is necessary to support additional lymph flow, as is often assumed, is unclear, as a reasonable counterargument can be made that the presence of lymphatic vessels at their basal density is more than sufficient to cover the physiological and even pathological needs to cope with problems of accumulated fluid. In addition, lymphangiogenesis combined with the formation of tertiary lymphoid organs under certain circumstances may sustain immune responses by facilitating the transport of antigens as well as immune cells. Inactivation of lymphatic vessel has been suggested to serve as a novel therapy to reduce cardiac allograft rejection and arteriosclerosis.

Table 1 
Differential diagnosis of external compression to vein, deep vein thrombosis and lymphangitis in SLE patients with unilateral limb oedema

Regarding pyomyositis, up to 90% of patients are diagnosed at the second stage, also known as the purulent stage.However, during this stage, a lack of speciﬁc signs and symptoms as well as atypical manifestations may also be observed in patients with SLE.In SLE child patients, pyomyositis is extremely rare with a prevalence of only 0.35% (1/289).However, the prevalence of pyomyositis in adult patients with SLE remains unclear. The diagnosis of pyomyositis is sometimes delayed or even missed due to its unfamiliarity to physicians. Any or all adverse conditions could result in high rates of complications and morbidity. Therefore, obtaining a timely diagnosis of pyomyositis in patients with SLE can be fraught with challenges. For a clinician, pyomyositis should be taken as a differential diagnosis for patients with an immunosuppression and immunocompromised state, like SLE. Imaging assessments, including ultrasonography, CT scans and MRIs, are important in diagnosing pyomyositis. Ultrasonography is a simple, easily available, non-radiative imaging tool used for diagnosis, although it may miss spotting early myositis, deep muscle abscess or lesions, where its ultrasound beam fails to detect. Alternatively, a contrast-enhanced CT scan and MRI can provide a comprehensive assessment of muscle lesions. If clinical symptoms, including fever, local oedema, swelling and erythematous change, do not improve after empirical antibiotics treatment, repeating an image study, such as a CT scan, is necessary for both detection of disease progression and determining the time when surgical intervention becomes necessary. Regarding our present case, the first CT scan showed no abscess formation in the chest wall. However, a subsequent CT scan performed 7 days later revealed the extensive involvement of pyomyositis with abscess formations. An accurate assessment of the location and extent of muscle abscess is essential for both proper treatment and preoperative planning.

Lymphedema diagnostic approach—For initial assessment, “clinical recognition of lymphedema is preferred over additional testing,” and “Certainly, venous duplex will be done in nearly all patients.” “Lymphoscintigraphy or ICG imaging while only available in specialized centers may be helpful to identify stage 0 or I disease or to provide confirmation to patients in whom the diagnosis is unclear.” When intervention is contemplated, “Imaging and physiologic testing is required for diagnosis when invasive treatment for lymphedema is planned or when the patient is part of a research trial.”

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^65e51177]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Limb-threatening diabetic foot infection—definition, criteria, and urgent management are detailed: in the PEDIS system, limb-threatening infections are classified as grade 3 or 4, and because of diabetes-associated immunosuppression, up to 50% of patients with limb-threatening infections may exhibit no systemic symptoms or leukocytosis. Limb-threatening infections are recognized as having one or more of the following findings: greater than 2 cm of cellulitis around an ulcer, lymphangitis, soft tissue necrosis, fluctuance, odor, gangrene, osteomyelitis, and when such an infection is recognized, the patient requires emergent hospital admission for appropriate intervention. Radiographs are necessary to evaluate for evidence of osteomyelitis or soft tissue gas, and if gas is identified in the ankle or hindfoot, radiographs of the lower leg should be obtained to assess the extent of the gas formation. Blood cultures are required if clinical findings indicate septicemia, other appropriate laboratory studies, including CBC with differential and sedimentation rate, are obtained as warranted, glucose management must be initiated to optimize metabolic perturbations and improve leukocyte function, and the patient's nutritional and metabolic status must be assessed and properly maintained. Consultations are typically required in the risk assessment and management of these complex cases, a multidisciplinary approach to the management of these cases has been shown to significantly improve outcomes, and early surgical treatment of the affected site is typically necessary as an integral part of infection management; at the time of debridement, aerobic, anaerobic, and fungal tissue cultures should be obtained from the depth of the wound to provide reliability, and although many initial drainage procedures can be performed at the bedside for neuropathic patients, most require thorough debridement in the operating room.

Consequences to patients, their families, and other caregivers.

The health consequences of LF for affected individuals increase as their lymphedema worsens. The episodic swelling and transient multi-day attacks of acute adenolymphangitis (ADL; also known as “acute attacks”) are tolerated in the early stages, but as they increase in frequency, intensity, and duration with progression of the disease, they become very much more problematic for the patient. Indeed, these acute attacks are commonly the prime reason patients actively seek medical help. With more severe lymphedema, it is not uncommon for patients to concern themselves primarily with preventing and treating ADLs specifically—an indication that although they might have become accustomed to having a disfigured limb, the acute attacks are still the most intolerable part of their LF disease. Patients who are most severely affected can even have multiple ADLs in a month, with devastating effects on their lives and on the lives of their families, including a negative impact on their socioeconomic status through decreased ability to work. A common statement by patients is that the lymphedematous limb feels abnormally heavy; after implementation of the care package, however, patients perceive relief that often leads to their expressing, with great satisfaction, that the affected limbs just “do not weigh as much anymore,” even without any externally apparent reduction in limb size.

Lymphedema treatment principles and compression technologies—The condition “is a progressive and incurable disease,” making “early diagnosis and intervention, analogous to treatments for cancer or other progressive disease, is paramount,” with “Intervention at pre-fibrotic (Stages 1–2) or even subclinical (Stage 0) stages is widely considered optimal for best results.” For venous overlap, “All patients with edema due to chronic venous insufficiency should be considered for treatment similar to lymphedema patients,” and recognition of coexistence “should prompt consideration for instituting advanced compressive modalities such as complete decongestive lymphatic physiotherapy and pneumatic compression pumps.” For maintenance, “The expert panel identified the use of compression for maintaining limb volume reduction as opposed to a primary method of decongestion,” and “Circular knit compression, flat knit compression and Velcro devices all garner support from the panelists.” “Decongestive therapy with SPC and MLD as part of an overall complex decongestive therapy program were also recognized, while surgical therapy had less support from the expert panel.” Device-oriented evidence noted that “APCDs (advanced pneumatic compression devices with calibrated gradient pressure) were superior to simpler devices (without calibrated gradient pressure),” and “The use of the trunk piece was felt by some to augment the physiologic effect.”

Lymphedema pathophysiology and the role of venous disease—Contemporary physiology indicates that “there was no steady state venous reabsorption of microvascular fluid but rather steady, dwindling filtration,” and “the lymphatics, not the venules, are predominantly responsible for maintaining tissue fluid balance by absorbing interstitial fluid and ultimately returning it into the circulation.” Expert statements note that “lymphatic failure is responsible for all forms of peripheral edema” and that “all chronic edema indicates an inadequacy or failure of lymph drainage,” and the panel acknowledges “the significant contribution from CVI.” Accordingly, “The edema associated with CVI (C3–C6) represents lymphatic failure or phlebolymphedema.”

Infection and global lymphedema etiology—The association of lower extremity infection with lymphedema is universally acknowledged, and globally lymphedema frequently occurs due to non-surgically-related lymphatic filariasis, which affects more than 40 million individuals worldwide; in this context, it would be incorrect to say that CRT is the most common factor for developing lymphedema. Damstra et al. performed lymphoscintigraphy on patients with an initial case of erysipelas and found evidence of significant subclinical lymphedema in the uninfected limb at baseline.
