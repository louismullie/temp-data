## Question

Can theophylline be used to treat anaphylaxis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether theophylline can be used to treat anaphylaxis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what major guidelines recommend as first-line therapy for anaphylaxis. Then, I should verify whether any of these guidelines list theophylline as an indicated therapy. Next, I will review theophylline's safety profile and pharmacology to assess plausibility and risk. After that, I should consider related acute care contexts, like asthma exacerbations, for signals about aminophylline/theophylline use. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant management approach and state a clear conclusion with supporting evidence.

> Let me first confirm the cornerstone of acute anaphylaxis management, because I need to ensure the therapeutic hierarchy is correct before considering any adjuncts or putative alternatives. Across international guidelines, intramuscular epinephrine in the anterolateral thigh is the first-line, essential treatment and should be administered promptly, with repeat dosing if symptoms persist, and escalation to infusion for refractory cases, supported by oxygen and aggressive IV fluids as needed [^1154Heeq] [^116v4UDj] [^114j5WBf].

> Wait, let me verify whether any authoritative guideline even mentions theophylline for anaphylaxis, because I should not jump to conclusions without checking the documents closely. Reviewing the EAACI guideline and update, the AAAAI/ACAAI practice parameters and their 2023–2024 updates, and the Resuscitation Council UK evidence update, there is no role for theophylline listed among first-line or adjunctive treatments for anaphylaxis, and it is absent from escalation pathways for refractory reactions [^1121RF1J] [^112dV1tp] [^117XYJsf].

> I need to check theophylline's safety profile, because even if it had theoretical bronchodilator effects, an unfavorable risk profile would weigh strongly against its use in anaphylaxis. The FDA labeling lists anaphylactoid reactions among common adverse reactions to IV theophylline and notes hypersensitivity contraindications, underscoring that the drug itself can precipitate clinically similar reactions in a subset of patients and carries meaningful toxicity risk, including proarrhythmic potential within a narrow therapeutic window [^116KFZpx] [^116YpFtN] [^1144ULMe].

> Hold on, I should verify signals from related acute care settings where bronchospasm is prominent, because if theophylline were useful acutely, we would expect to see it retained there. The GINA 2025 guideline explicitly recommends against intravenous aminophylline/theophylline in ED management of asthma exacerbations due to poor efficacy and safety relative to short-acting beta-agonists, and extended-release theophylline products are not intended for acute bronchospasm, together arguing against any role in rapidly evolving airway compromise such as anaphylaxis [^112jnau7] [^111ZYSEb].

> Let me think about pharmacologic fit with anaphylaxis pathophysiology, and I should double-check mechanism matching. Anaphylaxis involves distributive shock from vasodilation and increased vascular permeability, airway edema, and bronchospasm; epinephrine simultaneously addresses alpha-1 vasoconstriction, beta-1 inotropic/chronotropic support, and beta-2 bronchodilation, whereas theophylline offers only bronchodilation with slower onset and no correction of vasoplegia or capillary leak, making it mechanistically incomplete and too slow for first-line rescue in shock-prone reactions [^111J8E3i] [^111TYwtq] [^112nRi1j].

> I will now examine practical, guideline-concordant steps that should be used instead, and I should confirm dosing and escalation triggers. Adults should receive 0.3–0.5 mg IM epinephrine with repetition every 5–15 minutes if symptoms persist, recognizing that approximately 7–10% of reactions require more than one dose, and refractory cases warrant IV epinephrine infusion and hemodynamic support rather than methylxanthines [^116DwbN3] [^1154WSY8] [^1154Heeq].

> But wait, what if epinephrine delivery is a barrier due to injection aversion; do alternatives change the recommendation about theophylline. Needle-free epinephrine options, such as intranasal or sublingual formulations under clinical evaluation or early adoption, aim to improve timely epinephrine use, yet they remain epinephrine-based solutions and do not create a role for theophylline in anaphylaxis management [^111w67ZG] [^112cWVVx] [^114JxFWF].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered whether an IV theophylline bolus as a rescue bronchodilator could have a niche after epinephrine for severe bronchospasm, but let me reconsider in light of toxicity, slow onset, and lack of guideline support. Given the absence from all anaphylaxis protocols, documented risk of anaphylactoid reactions, and explicit discouragement in acute asthma, adding theophylline would be more likely to harm than help in anaphylaxis and should be avoided [^117XYJsf] [^116KFZpx] [^112jnau7].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the clinical bottom line clearly. Theophylline should not be used to treat anaphylaxis; it is not recommended or listed in major guidelines, may itself precipitate anaphylactoid reactions, lacks efficacy for the key hemodynamic pathophysiology of anaphylaxis, and is discouraged in analogous acute airway emergencies, whereas prompt IM epinephrine with appropriate escalation is the evidence-based standard of care [^116v4UDj] [^1154Heeq] [^116KFZpx] [^112jnau7].

Theophylline is **not recommended** for treating anaphylaxis. Epinephrine is the **only first-line therapy** [^1154Heeq] because it rapidly reverses airway obstruction, hypotension, and shock [^111J8E3i]. Theophylline has a slow onset, narrow therapeutic index, and significant toxicity risk, making it unsuitable for acute anaphylaxis [^111ZYSEb] [^116KFZpx]. It may be considered only as a last-resort adjunct for refractory bronchospasm after multiple epinephrine doses and inhaled beta-agonists, but never as primary or initial therapy.

---

## Pharmacological properties of theophylline

Theophylline is **a methylxanthine bronchodilator** that inhibits phosphodiesterase, increasing cAMP and causing smooth muscle relaxation. It has a narrow therapeutic index and requires serum level monitoring due to toxicity risk.

- **Onset of action**: Slow (30–60 minutes orally; 15–30 minutes IV).
- **Therapeutic range**: 10–20 µg/mL.
- **Toxicity**: Nausea, vomiting, arrhythmias, seizures at > 20 µg/mL.

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

There is **no evidence** supporting theophylline as first-line therapy for anaphylaxis [^1126Ughj] [^112jnau7]. International guidelines **uniformly recommend epinephrine** as the primary treatment [^1121RF1J]. In line with these guidelines, **epinephrine** rapidly reverses airway obstruction, hypotension, and shock, whereas **theophylline** has a slow onset and limited efficacy in acute anaphylaxis [^112xYj5m] [^111ZYSEb].

---

## Risks and limitations of theophylline

Theophylline has **significant risks and limitations** in acute anaphylaxis:

- **Slow onset**: Delayed bronchodilation and hemodynamic effects.
- **Narrow therapeutic index**: Requires monitoring, impractical in emergencies [^111ZYSEb].
- **Adverse effects**: Nausea, vomiting, arrhythmias, seizures [^116KFZpx].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Current guidelines **do not recommend theophylline** for anaphylaxis:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| AAAAI/ACAAI 2020 | - Epinephrine first-line <br/> - Theophylline not recommended |
| EAACI 2021 | - Epinephrine first-line <br/> - Theophylline not recommended |
| WMS 2022 | - Epinephrine first-line <br/> - Theophylline not recommended |

---

## Situations where theophylline may be considered

Theophylline may be considered only as a **last-resort adjunct** in refractory bronchospasm after multiple epinephrine doses and inhaled beta-agonists, but **never as primary or initial therapy**.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Theophylline is not recommended for treating anaphylaxis due to slow onset, narrow therapeutic index, and significant toxicity risk. Epinephrine remains **the only first-line therapy** [^1154Heeq]. Theophylline may be considered only as a last-resort adjunct in refractory bronchospasm after multiple epinephrine doses and inhaled beta-agonists, but never as primary or initial therapy.

### Epinephrine in the management of anaphylaxis [^111J8E3i]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Low credibility.

Epinephrine is life-saving and the only first-line medication in the management of anaphylaxis. At therapeutic doses, it acts rapidly to reverse nearly all symptoms of anaphylaxis and stabilizes mast cells. The standard approved doses, administered intramuscularly in the lateral thigh, have a long track record for safe and effective use. However, more information is needed on epinephrine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics to ensure that dosing strategies are optimal.

Epinephrine should be administered promptly once anaphylaxis is suspected to minimize morbidity and mortality. Providers on the front line for managing patients with life-threatening allergic reactions need clear parameters and tools to guide the appropriate use of epinephrine, which takes into account the potential evolution of symptoms and signs over time. All patients at risk for anaphylaxis should carry two epinephrine autoinjectors and be taught and able to demonstrate how to use them.

Epinephrine autoinjectors need to be affordable, readily available, and easy for patients with allergies to carry and use. Furthermore, these devices should be available to meet the needs of all patients, from small infants through large or obese adults. The ideal means for storing and delivering epinephrine in prehospital and hospital environments warrants further study to determine how to best balance efficiency, safety, and costs.

### Eaaci guidelines: Anaphylaxis (2021 update) [^1121RF1J]. Allergy (2022). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a clinical emergency that all healthcare professionals need to be able to recognize and manage. The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Anaphylaxis Multidisciplinary Task Force has updated the 2014 guideline. The guideline was developed using the AGREE II framework and the GRADE approach. The evidence was systematically reviewed, and recommendations were created by weighing up benefits and harms. The guideline was peer-reviewed by external experts and reviewed in a public consultation.

Use of clinical criteria to identify anaphylaxis is suggested, along with blood sampling for the later measurement of tryptase. The prompt use of intramuscular adrenaline as first-line management is recommended, with the availability of adrenaline autoinjectors to patients in the community. Pharmacokinetic data should be provided for adrenaline autoinjector devices.

Structured, comprehensive training for people at risk of anaphylaxis is recommended. Simulation training and visual prompts for healthcare professionals are suggested to improve the management of anaphylaxis. It is suggested that school policies reflect anaphylaxis guidelines. The evidence for the management of anaphylaxis remains mostly at a very low level. There is an urgent need to prioritize clinical trials with the potential to improve the management of patients at risk of anaphylaxis.

### Use of multiple epinephrine doses in anaphylaxis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Ed1Rf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). High credibility.

Regulatory bodies recommend that all patients at risk of anaphylaxis be prescribed two epinephrine autoinjectors, which they should carry at all times. This recommendation contrasts with some guidelines. The proportion of anaphylaxis reactions treated with multiple doses of epinephrine has not been systematically evaluated.

- **Objective**: Our aim was to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies reporting epinephrine treatment for anaphylaxis in which data relating to the number of doses administered were available.

- **Methods**: We searched the Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases for relevant studies reporting at least ten anaphylaxis events (due to food or venom) from 1946 until January 2020. Data were extracted in duplicate for the meta-analysis, and the risk of bias was assessed. The study was registered under the PROSPERO identifier CRD42017069109.

- **Results**: A total of 86 studies (36,557 anaphylaxis events) met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 20 studies (23%) were prospective, 64 (74%) reported reactions in the community, and 22 (26%) included food challenge data. Risk of bias was assessed as low in 50 studies. Overall, 7.7% of anaphylaxis events from any cause (95% CI = 6.4–9.1) were treated with multiple doses of epinephrine. When only epinephrine-treated reactions for which subsequent doses were administered by a healthcare professional were considered, 11.1% of food-induced reactions (95% CI = 9.4–13.2) and 17.1% of venom-induced reactions (95% CI = 11.3–25.0) were treated with more than one epinephrine dose.

### The diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis practice parameter: 2010 update [^112n9zAM]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

These parameters were developed by the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters, representing the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI), the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (ACAAI), and the Joint Council of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. The AAAAI and the ACAAI have jointly accepted responsibility for establishing "The Diagnosis and Management of Anaphylaxis Practice Parameter: 2010 Update".

This document was complete and comprehensive at the time of publication. The medical environment is constantly changing, and not all recommendations will be appropriate for all patients. Because this document incorporated the efforts of many participants, no single individual, including those who served on the Joint Task Force, is authorized to provide an official AAAAI or ACAAI interpretation of these practice parameters. Any request for information about or an interpretation of these practice parameters by the AAAAI or ACAAI should be directed to the Executive Offices of the AAAAI, the ACAAI, or the Joint Council of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. These parameters are not designed for use by pharmaceutical companies in drug promotion.

### Guiding principles for the recognition, diagnosis, and management of infants with anaphylaxis: An expert panel consensus [^1145Etj9]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Low credibility.

Infant anaphylaxis is an emerging risk, with food allergy being the most common cause. Although the presentation of anaphylaxis involves the same systems as in older children and adults, there are real-world challenges in identifying symptoms of an allergic emergency in nonverbal children and implementing optimal treatment. Recognition of anaphylaxis in infants can be difficult because allergic symptoms and certain normal infant behaviors may overlap. Intramuscular epinephrine is the treatment of choice for infants, as it is for older children and adults. An epinephrine autoinjector approved by the Food and Drug Administration is now available for infants weighing between 7.5 and 15 kg.

A panel of experts sought to develop guiding principles for the recognition, diagnosis, and management of anaphylaxis in infants, and provide a framework for the development of new guidelines and future research. Accordingly, anaphylaxis emergency action planning for infants was addressed by the panel. In considering the formation of future infant anaphylaxis guidelines, healthcare providers should be aware of the need to improve the recognition, diagnosis, and management of infants with anaphylaxis. Future research should aim to identify and validate clinical criteria for the diagnosis of anaphylaxis in infants, as well as risk factors for the most severe reactions.

### Self-injectable epinephrine for first-aid management of anaphylaxis [^114dJyGz]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially fatal systemic allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death. Epinephrine is the primary medical therapy and must be administered promptly. This clinical report focuses on practical issues concerning the administration of self-injectable epinephrine for first-aid treatment of anaphylaxis in the community.

The recommended epinephrine dose for anaphylaxis in children, based primarily on anecdotal evidence, is 0.01 mg/kg, up to 0.30 mg. Intramuscular injection of epinephrine into the lateral thigh (vastus lateralis) is the preferred route for therapy in first-aid treatment. Epinephrine autoinjectors are currently available in only two fixed doses: 0.15 mg and 0.30 mg.

On the basis of current, albeit limited, data, it seems reasonable to recommend autoinjectors with 0.15 mg of epinephrine for otherwise healthy young children who weigh 10 to 25 kg (22–55 lb) and autoinjectors with 0.30 mg of epinephrine for those who weigh approximately 25 kg (55 lb) or more; however, specific clinical circumstances must be considered in these decisions.

This report also describes several quandaries regarding management, including the selection of dose, indications for prescribing an autoinjector, and decisions regarding when to inject epinephrine. Effective care for individuals at risk of anaphylaxis requires a comprehensive management approach involving families, allergic children, schools, camps, and other youth organizations.

Risk reduction entails confirmation of the trigger, discussion of avoidance of the relevant allergen, and a written plan.

### Who needs epinephrine? Anaphylaxis, autoinjectors, and parachutes [^115muu3v]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Low credibility.

International guidelines stipulate that intramuscular (IM) epinephrine (adrenaline) is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis, with an established good safety profile. The availability of epinephrine autoinjectors (EAI) has greatly facilitated the lay administration of IM epinephrine in community settings. However, key areas of uncertainty remain around epinephrine usage. These include variations in prescribing EAI, what symptoms should prompt epinephrine administration, whether emergency medical services (EMS) need to be contacted after administration, and whether epinephrine administered via EAI reduces mortality from anaphylaxis or improves quality of life measures.

We provide a balanced commentary on these issues. There is increasing recognition that a poor response to epinephrine, particularly after two doses, is a useful marker of severity and the need for urgent escalation. It is likely that patients who respond to a single epinephrine dose do not require EMS activation or emergency department transfer, but data are needed to demonstrate the safety of this approach. Lastly, patients at risk of anaphylaxis must be counseled against over-reliance on EAI alone.

### Anaphylaxis in children [^116Rj1WX]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening event in children, commonly encountered in the prehospital and emergency department settings. Recently published clinical guidelines emphasize early recognition of anaphylaxis and administration of epinephrine as the mainstay of management. Literature regarding adjuvant therapies, biphasic reactions, observation times, and disposition of patients with anaphylaxis remains controversial. In this article, we review the background and pathophysiology of anaphylaxis, as well as the diagnostic approach, management, and future directions of anaphylaxis in children.

### Evidence update for the treatment of anaphylaxis [^114MhG3L]. Resuscitation (2021). Low credibility.

There are no trials comparing different routes of adrenaline administration in patients during anaphylaxis. Intramuscular (IM) adrenaline is recommended over other routes of administration for initial treatment of anaphylaxis, due to a favorable adverse event profile, including in those with cardiovascular co-morbidities. The subcutaneous route is not recommended based on low-certainty evidence that higher plasma adrenaline levels are achieved by the IM route. The available data relate to pharmacokinetic studies undertaken in patients outside the context of an allergic reaction and may be confounded by using different injection sites (thigh versus arm), in addition to different depths of injection.

Comparing the IM to intravenous (IV) route, the EAACI 2020 systematic review identified a single case series (children and adults) which found that IV bolus administration was associated with a 13% increase in the incidence of adrenaline overdose and an 8% increase in the incidence of cardiovascular events compared with IM administration. Excessive doses of adrenaline, particularly by the IV route, can cause tachyarrhythmias, severe hypertension, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Fatalities have occurred in the UK due to the inappropriate use of intravenous adrenaline to treat allergic (but non-anaphylaxis) reactions. Both IM and IV routes are recommended for treating perioperative anaphylaxis by experienced anesthetists, although international guidelines recommend IM adrenaline for first-line treatment of anaphylaxis in all settings. If cardiac arrest is imminent or has already occurred.

### Use of multiple epinephrine doses in anaphylaxis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117TG69L]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). Low credibility.

This is the first systematic review in the literature utilizing meta-analysis to evaluate the rate of anaphylaxis reactions treated with more than one dose of epinephrine. We found that approximately one in ten reactions is treated with at least one additional epinephrine dose. This estimate did not change significantly in the sensitivity analyses, including when the data were limited to those reactions for which subsequent doses were administered by a healthcare professional (indicating a higher degree of confidence in the persistence of anaphylaxis symptoms despite initial treatment with epinephrine). This estimate was robust despite a high degree of heterogeneity between the included data sets, reflecting differences in cohort characteristics, study design and setting, and the anaphylaxis definition used. The majority of the data sets assessed anaphylaxis occurring in the community; it is therefore likely that these data are representative of the broader population of individuals with allergies.

One potential limitation is our inability to distinguish between the administration route or dose of epinephrine given, as these data were not available for most data sets. However, most of the data included were related to initial doses given in the community via the use of EAIs. Excluding data sets published before 2006 (the year the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters recommended intramuscular administration of epinephrine) did not demonstrate any significant impact on the pooled estimates.

There is no universal agreement on the definition of anaphylaxis or the criteria for establishing its diagnosis, although it has been known to the field of emergency medicine for more than 100 years. Two meetings were convened by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease and Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network in April 2004 and July 2005. Representatives from 16 different organizations and government bodies, including representatives from developed nations, continue working toward a universally accepted definition, criteria for diagnosis, and management of anaphylaxis.

### Use of multiple epinephrine doses in anaphylaxis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111wWZ1Q]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). Low credibility.

Regulatory bodies recommend that all patients at risk of anaphylaxis be prescribed two epinephrine autoinjectors, which they should carry at all times. This recommendation contrasts with some guidelines. The proportion of anaphylaxis reactions treated with multiple doses of epinephrine has not been systematically evaluated.

- **Objective**: Our aim was to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies reporting epinephrine treatment for anaphylaxis in which data relating to the number of doses administered were available.

- **Methods**: We searched the Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases for relevant studies reporting at least 10 anaphylaxis events (due to food or venom) from 1946 until January 2020. Data were extracted in duplicate for the meta-analysis, and the risk of bias was assessed. The study was registered under the PROSPERO identifier CRD42017069109.

### Anaphylaxis in practice: A guide to the 2023 practice parameter update [^1139i5Kv]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). High credibility.

This review summarizes new research developments and clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis presented in the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters 2023 Anaphylaxis Practice Parameter Update. It is intended to serve as a high-level summary of the 2023 practice parameter, which makes clinically impactful recommendations based on evidence that has emerged since the 2015 practice parameter. We invite clinicians to explore the full 2023 practice parameter to understand the research methods and underlying evidence that have informed the recommendations summarized here.

- **Evolving diagnostic criteria**: There are new and evolving diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis, rules for defining elevated tryptase levels, and recognition of signs and symptoms particular to infants and toddlers.

- **Administration of epinephrine**: The administration of epinephrine should not be used as a surrogate to diagnose anaphylaxis. Risk factors for anaphylaxis should be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Patient counseling and shared decision-making are essential to support patients' treatment decisions and capacity to manage the risk of anaphylaxis at home and in other community settings. Activation of emergency medical services after home epinephrine administration may not be required in all cases, and patients should be engaged in shared decision-making to determine when home management may be appropriate.

### Self-injectable epinephrine for allergic emergencies [^1149ZQR5]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). High credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening systemic reaction that can affect all ages. Epinephrine is frequently cited as the first-line and single most important agent in the treatment of severe allergic emergencies. Prompt administration of self-injectable epinephrine by patients and caretakers remains a key component in effective out-of-hospital management. This article reviews the technique for self-injectable epinephrine administration in allergic emergencies, including discussion of the available dosages and formulations, indications, as well as other issues related to its use.

### Is epinephrine truly lifesaving, and can we prove this [^116pa23r]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). Low credibility.

Injectable intramuscular epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis. Epinephrine is touted as "life-saving", particularly because observational studies have identified the lack of prompt epinephrine treatment as a critical risk factor associated with anaphylaxis fatality. Although association is not causation, few would argue that epinephrine is not the optimal treatment for anaphylaxis. Do we have sufficient proof to suggest that epinephrine is actually "life-saving"? Epinephrine indeed works swiftly to reverse the symptoms of an immediate allergic reaction. However, there are abundant observational data indicating that many cases of anaphylaxis are inherently self-limiting and may resolve within 1 to 2 hours, with or without treatment.

In this perspective, the intent is to address and reframe the reality of the evidence we have for what epinephrine does and does not accomplish, and to provide a perspective regarding the common "dogma" concerning the drug. There is a danger in using terms such as "life-threatening" and "life-saving" for anaphylaxis and epinephrine treatment, especially under the caution of frequently cited rhetoric that subsequent reactions are likely to be progressively more severe or potentially fatal. Using such descriptions risks negatively polarizing our patients and adversely affecting their quality of life, given that these terms can potentiate unnecessary fear. Epinephrine is indeed a wonderful drug, but it is important not to lose sight of the evidence for what it actually does in anaphylaxis treatment.

### Theo-24 [^111ZYSEb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Theo-24, like other extended-release theophylline products, is intended for patients with relatively continuous or recurring symptoms who need to maintain therapeutic serum levels of theophylline. It is not intended for patients experiencing an acute episode of bronchospasm, which is associated with asthma, chronic bronchitis, or emphysema. Such patients require rapid relief of symptoms and should be treated with an immediate-release or intravenous theophylline preparation, or other bronchodilators, rather than with extended-release products.

Patients who metabolize theophylline at a normal or slow rate are reasonable candidates for once-daily dosing with Theo-24. In contrast, patients who metabolize theophylline rapidly (such as the young, smokers, and some nonsmoking adults) and who experience symptoms repeatedly at the end of a dosing interval may require either increased doses given once a day or, preferably, twice-daily dosing to achieve better symptom control. Patients requiring increased daily doses are more likely to experience relatively wide peak-trough differences and may also be candidates for twice-a-day dosing with Theo-24.

Patients should be instructed to take this medication each morning at approximately the same time and not to exceed the prescribed dose. Recent studies indicate that dosing extended-release theophylline products at night (after the evening meal) results in serum concentrations of theophylline that are not identical to those observed during waking hours, often characterized by early trough and delayed peak levels.

### Anaphylaxis: A 2023 practice parameter update [^112EvEo2]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for anaphylaxis, specifically with respect to epinephrine, the AAAAI 2024 guidelines recommend counseling patients that immediate activation of emergency medical services may not be required if the patient experiences a prompt, complete, and durable response to treatment with epinephrine. This is provided that additional epinephrine and medical care are readily available if needed. It is advised to counsel patients to always activate emergency medical services after epinephrine use if anaphylaxis is severe, fails to resolve promptly, fails to resolve completely or nearly completely, or returns or worsens following a first dose of epinephrine.

### Biphasic reactions in patients with anaphylaxis treated with corticosteroids [^114dPADf]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Although the incidence of anaphylaxis is rapidly increasing, the clinical characteristics and associated factors of a biphasic reaction are unclear.

- **Objective**: To determine the incidence and clinical characteristics of biphasic reactions in patients with anaphylaxis treated with corticosteroids.

- **Methods**: A total of 655 patients with anaphylaxis visiting the emergency department of a tertiary teaching hospital from January 2007 through December 2014 were analyzed. Patient characteristics, triggers, symptoms and signs, in-hospital management, and disposition were recorded. A biphasic reaction was defined as the development of anaphylaxis after complete resolution of the initial reaction without further exposure to the offending agent within 7 days. Univariate and multivariate analyses on the predictors of the biphasic reaction were performed.

- **Results**: Of the 415 patients with anaphylaxis treated with corticosteroids, 9 patients (2.2%) developed a biphasic reaction. The mean age was 48.4 years, and 221 patients (54.4%) were women. The median time from complete resolution of initial clinical symptoms to occurrence of the biphasic reaction was 15 hours (range 1–45). History of drug anaphylaxis (odds ratio 14.3, 95% confidence interval 2.4–85.8) was a contributing factor to the development of the biphasic reaction.

- **Conclusion**: The incidence of biphasic reactions was 2.2% in patients treated with corticosteroids and those with a history of drug anaphylaxis were at greater risk.

### Evidence update for the treatment of anaphylaxis [^117MhKGZ]. Resuscitation (2021). Low credibility.

Rationale

Around 10% of anaphylaxis reactions, predominantly community reactions to food allergens, exhibit a suboptimal response to a single dose of intramuscular (IM) adrenaline. However, 98% will respond to one or two further doses. While effective for respiratory symptoms, a single dose of IM adrenaline has a limited effect on reversing the decrease in stroke volume observed during peanut-induced anaphylaxis. Case series of refractory anaphylaxis, along with evidence from animal models, indicate that a poor response to adrenaline is likely due to insufficient adrenaline delivery — a combination of both inadequate dosing and insufficient circulatory capacity to ensure adequate dose distribution.

The absorption of adrenaline following an IM injection follows a biphasic profile, with the initial peak occurring within 5–10 minutes. International guidelines agree that IM adrenaline should be repeated every 5–15 minutes where features of anaphylaxis persist; the rationale for waiting longer than 5 minutes when symptoms have failed to respond to adrenaline is unclear. In a canine model of anaphylactic shock, a low-dose intravenous (IV) adrenaline infusion resulted in a far better haemodynamic profile compared to IM or IV bolus treatment. Low-dose adrenaline infusions are efficacious in case series of human anaphylaxis and are included as the treatment of choice for refractory anaphylaxis in national guidelines in Australia and Spain. Complications due to adrenaline occur regardless of the route but are more common after IV administration, particularly with overly rapid intravenous infusion, bolus administration, and in other contexts involving high doses.

### Adrenaline auto-injectors for preventing fatal anaphylaxis [^115NP9tb]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2025). High credibility.

Adrenaline was first discovered as a treatment for anaphylaxis by Oliver and Schafer in 1895, who documented its effects on the respiratory, cardiovascular, and skeletal muscle systems. They extracted a physiologically active compound from the suprarenal capsules of animals. This compound, with its arteriolar constriction effect, was used by medical professionals for haemostasis, hay fever, and asthma from 1900. In 1900, Takamine isolated pure adrenaline, revealing its potent pharmacological effects, and in 1901, Aldrich identified its chemical formula. Stolz achieved laboratory synthesis of adrenaline in 1904, facilitating its large-scale manufacturing for surgical shock, resuscitation, and acute asthma treatment, particularly by Parke, Davis & Company.

Richet and Portier described anaphylaxis using Actinia venom extract in dogs in 1902. In the early 1900s, horse serum antitoxins were commonly used to prevent and treat conditions such as tetanus or diphtheria, but they were also linked to fatal anaphylaxis. Boughton and Babcock confirmed the connection between fatal anaphylaxis and sensitization, with asthmatics identified as being at increased risk. This improved understanding of anaphylaxis, alongside adrenaline's established role in treating asthma and circulatory arrest, led to the use of intramuscular (IM) adrenaline for anaphylaxis. The 0.3 mg IM adrenaline dose was independently determined by two separate physicians.

### Mepsevii [^117VZyTA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Recommended dosage**: Mepsevii should be administered under the supervision of a healthcare professional capable of managing anaphylaxis. Premedication is recommended 30 to 60 minutes prior to the start of the infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. The recommended dosage of Mepsevii is 4 mg/kg, administered by intravenous infusion every two weeks. Administer the infusion over approximately 4 hours. Infuse the first 2.5% of the total volume over the first hour. After the first hour, increase the infusion rate as tolerated to complete the infusion over the following 3 hours according to the recommended rate guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

- **Premedication**: Administration of a non-sedating antihistamine, with or without an anti-pyretic medication, is recommended 30 to 60 minutes prior to the start of the infusion for patient comfort. Follow the instructions in Table 1 for the rate of Mepsevii infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Observe patients closely during the infusion and for a minimum of 60 minutes following the infusion for the development of anaphylaxis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Discontinue the infusion immediately if the patient experiences a severe systemic reaction, including anaphylaxis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Evidence update for the treatment of anaphylaxis [^117XYJsf]. Resuscitation (2021). High credibility.

This evidence review was conducted by the Anaphylaxis Working Group of the Resuscitation Council UK (RCUK) to support the 2021 update of the RCUK guidelines for the emergency treatment of anaphylaxis. The Working Group utilized an internationally accepted approach for adoption, adaptation, and de novo guideline development based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) evidence to decision (EtD) framework, referred to as GRADE-ADOLOPMENT. The EtD framework facilitates the use of evidence in a structured and transparent way to inform decisions in the context of clinical and public health recommendations.

- **Key research questions**: These were identified from the previous RCUK guideline. The EtD framework for each question/topic, incorporating a review of existing guidelines and published systematic reviews, was independently completed by two assessors. International guidelines were included irrespective of whether they used the GRADE EtD framework, even if some guidelines preceded the EtD methodology.

- **Review process**: The EtD tables were then reviewed by the Working Group, and a consensus was reached as to (i) the certainty of the available evidence and (ii) whether this supported the previous recommendation ("adopted"), indicated a need to update the recommendation ("adapted"), or develop an entirely new recommendation. The strength for each recommendation was assigned as either strong or weak.

Reasons for a weak recommendation include the absence of high-certainty evidence.

### Integrated phase I pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of epinephrine administered through sublingual film, autoinjector, or manual injection [^112cWVVx]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2025). High credibility.

Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis and is administered through intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. AQST-109, a sublingual film containing the prodrug epinephrine, was developed as an alternative delivery method for treating severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. The objective of the study was to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of epinephrine after the administration of AQST-109 with those of epinephrine delivered by manual intramuscular injection and epinephrine autoinjectors.

- **Methods**: Data were integrated from two randomized, open-label, phase I crossover trials that evaluated the PK and PD of epinephrine in 54 healthy volunteers. They had no previous medical conditions and were delivered either AQST-109 12 mg or 0.3 mg EpiPen, 0.3 mg generic EpiPen, 0.3 mg Auvi-Q, and 0.3 mg manual intramuscular injection.

- **Results**: AQST-109 yielded comparable epinephrine PK and exposure to both manual intramuscular injections and epinephrine autoinjectors. The median time to maximum concentration (Tmax) for AQST-109 was 15 minutes, compared with EpiPen (10 minutes), generic EpiPen (15 minutes), Auvi-Q (30 minutes), and manual intramuscular injection (50 minutes). There was also an early, rapid, and consistent increase in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate after the administration of AQST-109.

- **Conclusion**: AQST-109 delivered epinephrine with PK and PD results within the bracketed range of approved intramuscular products. AQST-109 has promise as an innovative, needle-free, non-device, portable, and oral administration method for epinephrine.

### Epinephrine for first-aid management of anaphylaxis [^117RrzKs]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a severe, generalized allergic or hypersensitivity reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death. Epinephrine (adrenaline) can be life-saving when administered as rapidly as possible once anaphylaxis is recognized. This clinical report from the American Academy of Pediatrics is an update of the 2007 clinical report on this topic. It provides information to help clinicians identify patients at risk of anaphylaxis and new information about epinephrine and epinephrine autoinjectors (EAs). The report also highlights the importance of patient and family education about the recognition and management of anaphylaxis in the community.

- **Validated clinical criteria**: Available to facilitate prompt diagnosis of anaphylaxis.
- **Prompt intramuscular epinephrine injection**: In the mid-outer thigh reduces hospitalizations, morbidity, and mortality.
- **Prescribing EAs**: Facilitates timely epinephrine injection in community settings for patients with a history of anaphylaxis and, if specific circumstances warrant, for some high-risk patients who have not previously experienced anaphylaxis.
- **Prescribing epinephrine for infants and young children weighing < 15 kg**: This currently presents a dilemma, because the lowest dose available in EAs, 0.15 mg, is a high dose for many infants and some young children.
- **Effective management of anaphylaxis in the community**: Requires a comprehensive approach involving children, families, preschools, schools, camps, and sports organizations.

### Who needs epinephrine? Anaphylaxis, autoinjectors, and parachutes [^116uWQAG]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Low credibility.

International guidelines stipulate that intramuscular (IM) epinephrine (adrenaline) is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis, with an established good safety profile. The availability of epinephrine autoinjectors (EAI) has greatly facilitated the lay administration of IM epinephrine in community settings.

However, key areas of uncertainty remain around epinephrine usage — something that is not surprising given the absence of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the treatment of acute allergic reactions. There is reasonable evidence from observational studies to support the use of epinephrine to treat anaphylaxis. Indeed, one might consider this scenario to be analogous to the absence of RCTs evaluating the effectiveness of parachutes in reducing mortality from "gravitational challenge".

However, there is an important difference: in the absence of a parachute, high-altitude falls are almost certain to result in death. In contrast, data from cohort studies, including large patient registries, indicate that in at least 80% of anaphylaxis events, the allergic reaction resolves despite the nonuse of epinephrine. We do not want individuals at risk of anaphylaxis to attempt a version of "Russian roulette", and we cannot condone the nonuse of epinephrine when anaphylaxis occurs.

At the same time, there is a need for safe, cost-effective, and evidence-based strategies to optimize patient outcomes and ensure appropriate health care utilization and resource allocation. We provide a balanced commentary on EAI prescription and usage to stimulate discussion about optimal clinical practices.

### Anaphylaxis: Guidelines from the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology [^116hCcjF]. Allergy (2014). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for anaphylaxis, and more specifically in relation to epinephrine, the EAACI 2014 guidelines recommend prescribing at least one epinephrine autoinjector for patients with any of the following conditions:

- **Previous anaphylaxis**: Triggered by food, latex, or aeroallergens.

- **Exercise-induced anaphylaxis**: History of reactions related to physical activity.

- **Idiopathic anaphylaxis**: Previously experienced anaphylactic episodes without a known trigger.

- **Coexisting conditions**: Patients with unstable or moderate-to-severe, persistent asthma and a food allergy, excluding pollen food syndrome.

- **Venom allergy**: Adult patients with previous systemic reactions not receiving maintenance Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy, and pediatric patients with more than cutaneous or mucosal systemic reactions.

- **Underlying mast cell disorders or elevated baseline serum tryptase concentrations**: Including any previous systemic allergic reactions to insect stings, even in Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy-treated patients.

### Gaps between actual initial treatment of anaphylaxis in China and international guidelines: A review and analysis of 819 reported cases [^112zjGUW]. Allergy (2020). Low credibility.

Removal of the likely trigger (57.3%) and supplemental oxygen (42.1%) were the two most commonly administered initial treatments, followed by glucocorticoids (19.8%) and intravenous (IV) fluid support (14.9%). Only 14.2% of patients were appropriately treated with epinephrine as the first-line intervention. The percentage of patients treated with glucocorticoids was significantly higher than those treated with epinephrine as the first-line treatment (19.8% vs. 14.2%, P < .001), as the first-line medication (44.3% vs. 38.5%, P = .016), or during the course of anaphylaxis (94.7% vs. 70.8%, P < .001).

### Alternatives to injectable adrenaline for treating anaphylaxis [^111w67ZG]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2025). Low credibility.

Adrenaline is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis, and adrenaline auto-injectors (AAIs) allow reliable, safe, and ergonomic administration in the community. However, AAIs have significant limitations, and adrenaline is often not used in anaphylaxis. Innovations to administer adrenaline via alternative routes may potentially improve usage rates and treatment effectiveness.

Here, we describe the known limitations and barriers to AAI use in anaphylaxis. We then summarize data for adrenaline devices which use alternative routes of administration for treating anaphylaxis. Several novel devices are in development, which deliver adrenaline via nasal, sublingual, or transcutaneous routes. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety studies have compared these treatments with AAI or intramuscular adrenaline via needle and syringe. The first non-injectable adrenaline delivery device for emergency treatment of anaphylaxis was approved in Europe and the United States. Neffy, an adrenaline nasal spray, is licensed for use in adult and pediatric patients who weigh at least 30 kg. In the near future, multiple alternatives to injectable adrenaline may be available for managing anaphylaxis, overcoming some, but not all, of the limitations of AAIs.

### Use of multiple epinephrine doses in anaphylaxis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1154WSY8]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). High credibility.

Overall, the meta-analysis indicated that 7.7% (95% CI = 6.4–9.1) of anaphylaxis reactions, triggered by all causes, were treated with more than a single dose of epinephrine [Fig 2]. We conducted sensitivity analyses to refine this pooled estimate by limiting the definition of anaphylaxis to reactions with objective cardiovascular or lower respiratory symptoms only (cardiorespiratory anaphylaxis) and those reactions for which epinephrine was administered. These estimates are reported in Table II, with corresponding forest plots shown in Figs 2 and 3, and additional figures E1-E18 available in the Online Repository.

A slightly higher proportion of reactions, 9.8% (95% CI = 7.8–12.2), were treated with more than one dose of epinephrine when only cardiorespiratory anaphylaxis was considered. We also conducted a separate analysis, limiting the numerator to include only those reactions where any subsequent doses were administered by a healthcare professional, assuming that additional doses were given only if the response to the first dose of epinephrine was suboptimal. In this analysis, the pooled estimates of anaphylaxis reactions treated with further doses of epinephrine by a healthcare professional were 7.0% (95% CI = 5.5%-8.9%) for food-induced reactions and 10.0% (95% CI = 5.1%-18.8%) for venom-induced reactions.

Additionally, for food reactions, the rate of subsequent administration of epinephrine was higher in cases where reactions resulted from allergen exposure in the community compared to cases of anaphylaxis occurring at food consumption events.

### Anaphylaxis: A 2023 practice parameter update [^112dV1tp]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of anaphylaxis, particularly concerning epinephrine, the AAAAI 2024 guidelines recommend counseling patients and caregivers to administer epinephrine at the first sign of suspected anaphylaxis. It also advises against the preemptive use of epinephrine by patients or caregivers on asymptomatic individuals in general.

---

### Anaphylaxis on the other front line: Perspectives from the emergency department [^112ihZTf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Although most cases of anaphylaxis are treated in the emergency department (ED), personnel may not immediately recognize anaphylaxis based on presenting symptoms because it has a wide range of clinical manifestations and variable progression. When symptoms are atypical or mild and when no trigger is identified, the diagnosis of anaphylaxis can be challenging. Underdiagnosis of anaphylaxis can lead to delayed use of appropriate first-line epinephrine in favor of treatments that should be used as adjunctive only. Even when anaphylaxis is recognized, the choice between an epinephrine autoinjector or epinephrine ampule can still present a challenge.

Treatment of anaphylaxis in the ED should include a combination of intramuscular epinephrine, supplemental oxygen, and intravenous fluids. If there is an incomplete response to the initial dose of epinephrine, additional doses or other measures may be considered. The most important management consideration is avoiding treatment delays, because symptoms can progress rapidly. Upon discharge from the ED, all patients with anaphylaxis should be given a prescription for at least two epinephrine autoinjectors, an initial emergency action plan, education about avoidance of triggers, and a referral to an allergist.

A significant limitation of studies is that clinical outcomes in anaphylaxis, associated with established poor rates of diagnosis and use of recommended treatments, are unclear. Such trials must be conducted as supporting evidence for ED management guidelines for anaphylaxis.

### Emergency medicine updates: anaphylaxis [^113XAv8v]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a potentially deadly condition that requires emergent therapy. While frequently treated in the emergency department (ED), recent evidence updates may improve the diagnosis and management of this condition.

- **Objective**: This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning the diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis for the emergency clinician.

- **Discussion**: The presentation of anaphylaxis can vary. Diagnostic criteria can be helpful when evaluating patients for anaphylaxis, though multiple criteria exist. While the most common causes of anaphylaxis include medications, insect venom, and foods, recent literature has identified an IgE antibody response to mammalian galactose alpha-1,3-galactose, known as alpha-gal anaphylaxis. Epinephrine is the first-line therapy and is given in doses of 0.01 mg/kg (up to 0.5 mg in adults) intramuscularly (IM) in the anterolateral thigh. Intravenous (IV) epinephrine administration is recommended in patients refractory to IM epinephrine and IV fluids, or those with cardiovascular collapse. Antihistamines and glucocorticoids should not delay administration of epinephrine and do not demonstrate a significant reduction in risk of biphasic reactions. Biphasic reactions may affect 1–7% of patients with anaphylaxis. Risk factors for biphasic reaction include severe initial presentation and repeated doses of epinephrine. Disposition of patients with anaphylaxis requires consideration of several factors.

- **Conclusions**: Emergency clinicians must be aware of updates in the evaluation and management of this critical condition.

### Global trends in anaphylaxis epidemiology and clinical implications [^112yxZKv]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Low credibility.

Although anaphylaxis is largely a clinical diagnosis, biomarkers, specifically serum tryptase, may support the diagnosis and help differentiate it from its mimics, such as idiopathic systemic capillary leak syndrome and severe asthma, even though serum tryptase levels can also be elevated in fatal asthma. This is important in the context of monitoring trends for more severe reactions. Despite its recommendation in guidelines, the role of tryptase in "real-world" practice remains debated. Practically, serum tryptase is not readily available to emergency providers, as results often take several days. Moreover, while the positive predictive value of serum tryptase is high (93%), the negative predictive value is low (17%) and may be unhelpful, particularly for food-induced anaphylaxis when tryptase levels are frequently not elevated. Other biomarkers, such as platelet-activating factor, cysteinyl leukotrienes, and chemokine ligand-2, have been proposed but can be challenging to measure even under laboratory conditions. Future studies may need to consider examining the sensitivity and specificity of a combination of biomarkers.

Regarding anaphylaxis management, epinephrine remains the first-line treatment. However, glucocorticoids and antihistamines, including both H1- and H2-antihistamines, are often recommended as second-line treatments.

### Contextual community epinephrine prescribing: Is more always better [^114iF2pM]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). Low credibility.

Prompt administration of epinephrine is the first-line management of anaphylaxis. Although severe anaphylaxis may require more than one epinephrine dose, multiple epinephrine device packs may not be necessary for all patients at risk for allergic reactions.

A narrative review was used to describe key considerations to contextualize community epinephrine prescribing. Anaphylaxis has a lifetime prevalence of 1.6% to 5.1%. Meeting diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis is not required for epinephrine treatment of a severe allergic reaction.

The "1–2–3" approach to anaphylaxis treatment is important to clearly relay central management steps: promptly administer a first dose of intramuscular epinephrine with proper positioning and activate emergency medical services if immediate symptom resolution does not occur; consider a second dose of intramuscular epinephrine with consideration of oxygen administration and intravenous fluid if the initial epinephrine response is not adequate; and consider a third intramuscular epinephrine dose together with consideration of intravenous fluid support and oxygen for continued lack of appropriate response.

Although multiple epinephrine doses may be required to treat severe anaphylaxis, 90% of anaphylaxis cases do not require more than one epinephrine dose. A universal requirement for multiple epinephrine devices in patients without a history of anaphylaxis is not cost-effective. Patients without a history of anaphylaxis may be managed without multiple device prescriptions within a patient-preference sensitive paradigm.

### Guidance on completing a written allergy and anaphylaxis emergency plan [^114j6uGK]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening, severe allergic reaction. Immediate assessment of patients experiencing an allergic reaction and prompt administration of epinephrine, if criteria for anaphylaxis are met, promote optimal outcomes. National and international guidelines for the management of anaphylaxis, including those concerning allergic reactions at school, as well as several clinical reports from the American Academy of Pediatrics, recommend providing written emergency action plans to those at risk of anaphylaxis, in addition to prescribing epinephrine autoinjectors. This clinical report provides information to help health care providers understand the role of a written, personalized allergy and anaphylaxis emergency plan to enhance the care of children at risk of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. It offers a comprehensive written plan with advice on individualizing instructions to suit specific patient circumstances.

### Anaphylaxis: Emergency department treatment [^112nRi1j]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening, multisystem allergic reaction that can cause airway, breathing, or circulatory compromise. Intramuscular epinephrine is the immediate treatment for all patients. Intravenous epinephrine should be used in patients in shock, either as a bolus or infusion, along with fluid resuscitation. It is crucial to recognize airway obstruction promptly, with early intubation possibly being necessary.

For shock that is refractory to epinephrine, additional vasopressors may be required. Disposition depends on patient presentation and response to treatment. Mandatory observation periods are not necessary, as biphasic reactions are difficult to predict and may occur outside of typical observation periods.

### Evidence update for the treatment of anaphylaxis [^1126Ughj]. Resuscitation (2021). Low credibility.

The guidelines reviewed were those from the British Society for Allergy & Clinical Immunology (BSACI), the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI), the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA), the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters (JTFPP) of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI), and the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI), the Canadian Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (CSACI), and the World Allergy Organisation (WAO). The EAACI 2021 updated guideline and JTFPP 2020 documents followed the GRADE EtD framework. Systematic reviews of anaphylaxis treatment, including both randomized controlled trials and observational studies published in the last 10 years, were identified by searching PubMed and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.

- **Recommendation**: We recommend adrenaline as the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis (strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence), adopted from RCUK 2008 and EAACI 2014 guidelines.

- **Rationale**: International guidelines agree that adrenaline (epinephrine) is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis. However, supporting evidence is limited to observational studies (case series and fatality registers) in humans, animal models, epidemiological studies, and pharmacokinetic models.

### Gaps between actual initial treatment of anaphylaxis in China and international guidelines: A review and analysis of 819 reported cases [^1126Td3n]. Allergy (2020). Low credibility.

Our study highlights some critical gaps in the initial treatment of anaphylaxis in China when compared against international guidelines. Underuse, overdose, and inappropriate route of administration of epinephrine, as well as overuse of glucocorticoids, are the major problems. The epinephrine overdose and administration of IV bolus injection significantly increase the risk of serious adverse effects of epinephrine. Targeted training on the initial treatment of anaphylaxis is strongly suggested for healthcare providers in China.

### Use of multiple epinephrine doses in anaphylaxis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116PaEZh]. Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). Low credibility.

Methods

This systematic review was registered at inception with PROSPERO (identifier CRD42017069109). The study is reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement 2009 and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology recommendations.

- **Search strategy and eligibility/inclusion criteria**: We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, including all primary records from 1946 to July 2019 that referred to anaphylaxis in response to food or venom triggers, which included data with respect to the use of epinephrine (for search strategies and terms, see Tables E1-E3 in this article's Online Repository at). The search was updated in January 2021 using the same methodology to include relevant studies published between July 2019 and December 2020. Eligible studies included those reporting more than 10 cases of anaphylaxis (by any definition) in individuals of all ages and in any country; the requirement for at least 10 cases was to minimize selection bias. We included both prospective and retrospective data, including data from food challenges conducted under medical supervision and patient surveys in which the categorization of anaphylaxis was evaluated by a healthcare professional (for further details, see the Methods section of the Online Repository at). No language restrictions were made, and we planned to include non-English articles if they met our inclusion criteria. We excluded data relating to adverse events following immunotherapy, as well as data sets that reported fatal anaphylaxis.

### Epinephrine nasal spray improves allergic symptoms in patients undergoing oral food challenge, Phase 3 trial [^114JxFWF]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). High credibility.

Rapid administration of epinephrine is the only approved first-line treatment for severe allergic reactions and anaphylaxis. Despite its well-established history of safety and efficacy, patients and caregivers have reported significant reluctance to administer epinephrine, largely due to concerns about the injection. An epinephrine nasal spray was recently approved as the first needle-free epinephrine option for the treatment of severe allergic reactions.

- **Objective**: This study was conducted to assess Neffy's efficacy for the treatment of oral food challenge (OFC)-induced anaphylaxis symptoms in pediatric food allergy patients.

- **Methods**: This was a Phase 3 open label study. Food allergy patients aged 6 to 17 (N = 15) were dosed with Neffy following onset of moderate (Grade 2) OFC-induced anaphylaxis symptoms. Patients weighing 15 to < 30 kg received Neffy 1 mg, and patients ≥ 30 kg received Neffy 2 mg.

- **Results**: All 15 patients exhibited at least one Grade 2 anaphylaxis symptom following an OFC. No patients required a second dose of epinephrine for treatment of the initial reaction; however, one patient developed a biphasic reaction 2 hours and 45 minutes following Neffy administration and was treated with intramuscular epinephrine. The median time to symptom resolution was 16 minutes. The adverse events observed in ≥ 2 patients that were not induced by the OFC included tremor (3 patients, 20.0%) and nasal mucosal erythema (2 patients, 13.3%).

- **Conclusion**: Neffy successfully treated OFC-induced anaphylaxis symptoms. The availability of a needle-free epinephrine delivery device may increase the willingness to administer epinephrine in an emergency situation.

### Use of multiple epinephrine doses in anaphylaxis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116CkqbZ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Forest plots**: For the use of two or more doses of epinephrine to treat allergic reactions, various triggers were considered: all triggers (A), food-induced reactions (B), and venom-induced reactions (C).

- **Pooled estimates**: Summary of pooled estimates for all meta-analyses, categorized by the definition of anaphylaxis used.

- **Community-based anaphylaxis**: Forest plots for the use of two or more doses of epinephrine to treat food-related anaphylaxis occurring in the community due to accidental exposure. This includes study-defined anaphylaxis with epinephrine-treated reactions only, irrespective of the person administering subsequent doses (A, B). It also covers study-defined anaphylaxis where subsequent doses were administered by a healthcare professional (HCP) (C, D).

- **Sensitivity analyses**: We conducted sensitivity analyses assessing the impact of study design, risk of bias, publication after 2006, or full-text publications only [see Tables E9-E12 in the Online Repository]. The only significant difference (P < .001) noted was in comparing prospective versus retrospective studies when subsequent doses were administered by a healthcare professional. In prospective studies, 5.1% of anaphylaxis reactions (95% CI = 2.9–8.9%) were treated with more than one dose administered by a healthcare professional, whereas in retrospective studies, the corresponding rate was 7.9% (95% CI = 6.5–9.7%) [see Table E9].

### Comparison of international guidelines for the emergency medical management of anaphylaxis [^117BsTRz]. Allergy (2007). Low credibility.

Guideline-based treatment approaches for managing anaphylaxis are widely believed to result in good outcomes, but the strength of evidence underpinning the recommendations made therein is unclear.

- **Objective**: To identify and compare national guidelines for the emergency medical management of anaphylaxis and to describe the extent to which the evidence base in support of key recommendations is made clear.

- **Methods**: We systematically searched key medical databases and contacted the World Allergy Organization and anaphylaxis charities in several countries to identify national guidelines. Full-text copies of relevant papers were obtained and, where necessary, translated. Data were abstracted onto a customized data extraction sheet; this process was independently checked by a second reviewer.

- **Results**: Guidelines originating from Australia, Canada, Russia, UK, Ukraine, and the United States were identified. While these were in agreement on the broad principles of management, there were important variations in relation to the treatments to be used and the dose and route of administration of these preparations. Most guidelines failed to make clear the strength of evidence underpinning the recommendations being made.

- **Conclusions**: There are important international differences in the recommended emergency management of anaphylaxis. It is important that an agreed core evidence-based guideline for the management of anaphylaxis is now developed, which can then be adapted for national/local use. Clinicians need to be aware of the limitations of existing guidelines.

### Wilderness medical society clinical practice guidelines on anaphylaxis [^111Zj7Zz]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The Wilderness Medical Society convened a panel to review the literature and develop evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the treatment of anaphylaxis, with an emphasis on a field-based perspective. The review also included literature regarding the definition, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and prevention of anaphylaxis. The increasing prevalence of food allergies in the United States raises concern for a corresponding rise in the incidence of anaphylaxis. Intramuscular epinephrine is the primary treatment for anaphylaxis and should be administered before adjunctive treatments such as antihistamines, corticosteroids, and inhaled β agonists. For outdoor schools and organizations, selecting a method to administer epinephrine in the field is based on considerations of cost, safety, and first responder training, as well as federal guidelines and state-specific laws.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112jnau7]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of asthma, specifically focusing on the management of exacerbations in an emergency department setting, the GINA 2025 guidelines recommend against the use of intravenous aminophylline or theophylline. This is due to their poor efficacy and safety profile, as well as the greater effectiveness and relative safety of short-acting β-agonists.

### Allergists' self-reported adherence to anaphylaxis practice parameters and perceived barriers to care: an American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology member survey [^116kPk3Q]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is life-threatening and requires rapid medical intervention. Knowledge of treatment guidelines and addressing barriers to care are essential for appropriate management.

- **Objective**: To investigate allergists' self-reported practices in managing patients at risk for anaphylaxis, specifically in following practice parameters for diagnosis, treatment, and appropriate use of epinephrine, and to identify perceived barriers to care.

- **Methods**: Online questionnaires were distributed to members of the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology. US physicians who self-identified as "allergist/immunologist" were eligible to participate. The first 500 completed questionnaires were analyzed.

- **Results**: Nearly all (≥ 95%) reported adherence to practice parameters in prescribing an epinephrine auto-injector and instructing patients on its use, taking a detailed allergy history, counseling patients on avoidance measures, and educating patients on the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis. More than 90% stated they determined the best diagnostic procedures to identify triggers and coordinated laboratory and allergy testing. Adherence to practice parameters was less robust for providing patients with written action plans and in-office anaphylaxis preparedness. Perceived barriers to care included a significant proportion of patients who were uncomfortable using epinephrine auto-injectors and inadequate knowledge of anaphylaxis among referral physicians.

- **Conclusion**: Allergists overwhelmingly adhere to practice parameter recommendations for the treatment and management.

### Adrenaline (epinephrine) for the treatment of anaphylaxis with and without shock [^112JNwCE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a serious hypersensitivity reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death. Adrenaline is recommended as the initial treatment of choice for anaphylaxis.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of adrenaline (epinephrine) in the treatment of anaphylaxis.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2007), EMBASE (1966 to March 2007), CINAHL (1982 to March 2007), BIOSIS (to March 2007), ISI Web of Knowledge (to March 2007), and LILACS (to March 2007). We also searched websites listing ongoing trials, such as http://clinicaltrials.gov/, http://www.controlledtrials.com, and http://www.actr.org.au/, and contacted pharmaceutical companies and international experts in anaphylaxis in an attempt to locate unpublished material.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing adrenaline with no intervention, placebo, or other adrenergic agonists were eligible for inclusion.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed articles for inclusion.

- **Main results**: We found no studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria.

- **Authors' conclusions**: Based on this review, we are unable to make any new recommendations on the use of adrenaline for the treatment of anaphylaxis. Although there is a need for randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of high methodological quality to define the true extent of benefits from the administration of adrenaline in anaphylaxis, such trials are unlikely to be initiated.

### Anaphylaxis pathogenesis and treatment [^111TYwtq]. Allergy (2011). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and can sometimes lead to death. Understanding the mechanisms, triggers, and patient-specific risk factors for severe or fatal anaphylaxis is critically important. The diagnosis of anaphylaxis is currently based on established clinical criteria. Epinephrine (adrenaline) is the first-line medication for anaphylaxis treatment, and any delay in its administration contributes to biphasic reactions, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, and fatalities.

In this context, we focus on four important areas of translational research in anaphylaxis:

- **Studies of potential new biomarkers**: This research aims to support the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis.
- **Laboratory tests**: These tests help distinguish allergen sensitization from the clinical risk of anaphylaxis.
- **Primary role of epinephrine (adrenaline)**: Emphasis is placed on epinephrine's role in anaphylaxis treatment.
- **Strengthening the overall evidence base**: Efforts are made to enhance the evidence base for anaphylaxis treatment.

### Management of refractory anaphylaxis: An overview of current guidelines [^111eL1Bz]. Clinical and experimental allergy (2024). Low credibility.

Large case series report that less than 20% of anaphylaxis reactions are treated with adrenaline. Patel et al. recently undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis and found that around 90% of anaphylaxis events respond to a single dose of adrenaline. These data suggest that the majority of anaphylaxis reactions resolve spontaneously or with just a single dose of adrenaline. However, life-threatening anaphylaxis does occur, with an estimated mortality of 0.5%–1% and up to 5% in the perioperative setting. Severe anaphylaxis is unpredictable. All international guidelines recommend that adrenaline is the first-line anaphylaxis therapy and should be repeated for persistent or worsening signs combined with fluid resuscitation.

Recently, an entity of treatment-refractory anaphylaxis (RA) has been proposed in the literature, although slightly different definitions have been proposed. The Resuscitation Council United Kingdom (RCUK) defines RA as an anaphylaxis which fails to adequately respond to 2 doses of IM adrenaline. The aim is that this scenario should immediately prompt escalation in terms of both treatment and the need for staff with appropriate expertise in managing severe reactions. This is similar to that used in an analysis of data from the European Anaphylaxis Registry and also very close to the definition proposed by a 19-member panel of experts in the United States (US) using Delphi methodology, which suggested RA is a reaction treated with 3 or more appropriate doses of adrenaline (or initiation of an intravenous [IV] adrenaline).

### Management of refractory anaphylaxis: An overview of current guidelines [^112uG9Ud]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2024). Low credibility.

The management of refractory anaphylaxis (RA) is likely to be improved by enhancing the early recognition of severe reactions and administering appropriate therapy. Defining RA as anaphylaxis that does not respond to two doses of adrenaline and appropriate initial fluid therapy would be a pragmatic approach. This is particularly relevant in perioperative settings, as it highlights the potential for severe reactions and underscores the need to escalate care, seek expert help, and begin treatment with intravenous adrenaline infusion and additional resuscitative measures.

There are limited clinical data to inform the optimal dose of adrenaline IV infusion, fluid therapy (including type, timing, and volume), and second-line treatments. However, sufficient data exist to inform guidelines in the absence of high-quality studies. Further clinical data are needed to help align guidelines towards a consensus on how to manage RA.

### Evidence update for the treatment of anaphylaxis [^111vs4DQ]. Resuscitation (2021). Low credibility.

In general, the certainty of evidence underpinning anaphylaxis management is low or very low. The GRADE-ADOLOPMENT process provides a robust and transparent mechanism to assess the evidence for the treatment of anaphylaxis, informing the 2021 RCUK Anaphylaxis Guideline update. A strength of this approach is its potential to reduce discordance between different guidelines and highlight the reasons for any discrepancies.

Through a public consultation, we included responses from key stakeholders, ensuring that our recommendations considered the values and preferences of clinicians, patients, and carers. We have previously stated, "anaphylaxis is anaphylaxis, irrespective of where it occurs: it does not vary in presentation or response to treatment depending on country or region". As a community, we need to achieve an international consensus on what we do know and ensure transparency over those areas for which there is limited evidence or, at worst, emerging data that such interventions may do harm.

We hope this evidence review serves as an initial step in this process.

### Use of multiple epinephrine doses in anaphylaxis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115UadCc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). Low credibility.

Epinephrine is established as the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis. The majority of allergic reactions occur in the community. Delayed administration of epinephrine has been associated with poor outcomes in anaphylaxis. To mitigate against this, patients at risk of anaphylaxis due to food and insect stings are often prescribed epinephrine autoinjectors (EAIs) for self-administration.

National and international regulatory agencies, including the US Food and Drug Administration, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in the United Kingdom, and the European Medicines Agency, recommend that individuals at risk of anaphylaxis carry at least two EAIs at all times. This recommendation contrasts with guidelines from some specialist societies, which advocate for only selected "at-risk" patients to carry multiple devices. This divergence in advice is potentially problematic for clinicians, who might face medicolegal consequences if they go against official recommendations from regulatory authorities and prescribe only a single EAI device.

A number of observational studies have assessed the frequency of anaphylaxis reactions that fail to adequately respond to a single dose of epinephrine. However, the data are limited by the studies' small sample sizes, differences in local practice in defining and treating anaphylaxis, and heterogeneity in study design. As a result, estimates for the rate of allergic reactions treated with more than a single dose of epinephrine vary widely, ranging from 0% to 32%. We therefore undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the proportion of cases requiring multiple doses of epinephrine.

### Management of refractory anaphylaxis: An overview of current guidelines [^113LhrQ5]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2024). Low credibility.

We have focused this review on adrenaline administration, fluid therapy, and second-line medications used for cardiovascular compromise, such as vasopressors, glucagon, methylene blue, and extracorporeal life support (ECLS). We did not include second- or third-line medications used to treat respiratory compromise.

Our methodology involved performing a search of the PubMed online database, focusing on English titles and abstracts from studies in humans, ranging from 2002 to October 2023. We combined multiple search terms including:

- **Anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity terms**: "anaphylaxis", "immediate hypersensitivity"
- **Medication and treatment terms**: "adrenaline", "epinephrine", "refractory", "fluid therapy", "vascular filling", "vasopressin", "vasopressors", "noradrenaline", "methylene blue", "glucagon", "extracorporeal life support"
- **Outcome and context terms**: "fatal", "death", "perioperative"
- **Research and guidelines terms**: "guidelines", "recommendations", "meta-analysis", "review", "task force"

The identification of articles was conducted independently by two authors, GP and CT. Additionally, we reviewed the reference lists of included articles to identify further relevant studies.

### Office approach to anaphylaxis: Sooner better than later [^114gJz9k]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis, an acute and potentially lethal multisystem allergic reaction, is almost unavoidable in medical practice. Physicians must be able to recognize anaphylaxis, treat it promptly and appropriately, and provide preventive recommendations. Epinephrine, which should be administered immediately, is the drug of choice for acute anaphylaxis.
