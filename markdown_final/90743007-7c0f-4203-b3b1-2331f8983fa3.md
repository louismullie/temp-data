## Question

What are the recommendations for pacemaker implantation in patients with intermittent Mobitz II block

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommendations for pacemaker implantation in patients with intermittent Mobitz type II second-degree AV block. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precisely defining Mobitz II and distinguishing it from Mobitz I and 2:1 patterns. Then, I should verify the guideline stance on pacing indications, especially whether symptoms are required. Next, I will examine the pathophysiology and natural history to understand risk even when episodes are intermittent. After that, I need to check for reversible or physiologic causes that could change management. I will then consider special populations such as acute MI, TAVR, neuromuscular disease, and pregnancy. Finally, I should review device selection nuances, monitoring strategies, and synthesize a practical recommendation with strength of evidence and shared decision-making considerations.

> Let me first confirm the definition and electrophysiologic substrate. Mobitz type II block is an infranodal, His-Purkinje conduction disorder characterized by sudden, nonconducted P waves without progressive PR prolongation, typically with a wide QRS when bundle-branch involvement is present, and it carries a propensity to progress unpredictably to high-grade or complete AV block with unstable ventricular escape rhythms, unlike Mobitz I which is usually nodal and more benign [^116AGMUi] [^116uhdf3].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline position on pacing indications before assuming anything about symptoms. The 2018 ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia guideline gives a Class I recommendation for permanent pacing in acquired second-degree Mobitz type II AV block not due to reversible or physiologic causes, regardless of symptoms, reflecting the risk of sudden progression and adverse outcomes even in asymptomatic patients [^112XanjB] [^113x8wXN] [^115zxLEo].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "intermittent" implying lower risk. I should confirm the natural history data. Observational studies summarized in the guideline show that untreated Mobitz II and high-grade AV block are associated with recurrent syncope, heart failure, and reduced survival, with a demonstrated 5-year survival benefit from pacing even in patients who are initially asymptomatic, underscoring that intermittency does not mitigate risk [^1154h8VM] [^116C3MPJ] [^114ZsUkt].

> I need to ensure we exclude reversible or physiologic causes before labeling the indication as permanent. Reversible contributors include drug toxicity such as beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, or antiarrhythmics; acute ischemia; electrolyte disturbances; hypervagotonia including sleep apnea; infectious etiologies like Lyme disease; and perioperative or inflammatory states; if a reversible cause is identified and corrected with restoration of normal conduction, pacing may be deferred, but persistent Mobitz II after correction still warrants permanent pacing [^112XanjB] [^114VFN5L] [^111M2d6E].

> Let me consider special populations where the threshold and timing may differ. In acute MI, permanent pacing is indicated after a waiting period for persistent or infranodal Mobitz II, high-grade, or complete AV block, whereas transient block that resolves should not lead to permanent pacing. Contemporary ACS guidance aligns with this approach, emphasizing a deliberate waiting interval before committing to a permanent system [^115JHS8k] [^112uByVh]. In TAVR, new conduction disturbances including Mobitz II carry a high risk of delayed high-grade AV block, and institutional protocols often use prolonged monitoring and selective early pacing strategies. Rapid atrial pacing during the procedure and serial ECG changes inform risk, and EPS markers such as HV prolongation predict progression, supporting early consideration of pacing in high-risk phenotypes [^1122v7uX] [^114jRHTJ] [^1132vxCB]. In neuromuscular diseases like myotonic dystrophy or Kearns-Sayre, any second- or third-degree AV block or marked HV prolongation warrants pacing regardless of symptoms due to unpredictable progression and sudden death risk, often with consideration of ICD backup if meaningful survival is expected [^115zxLEo] [^116zDNVS] [^114ZsUkt]. In pregnancy, irreversible symptomatic Mobitz II or complete AV block merits permanent pacing with radiation-minimizing techniques to protect mother and fetus [^111rwFc9].

> Next, I should review device selection nuances, especially when ventricular pacing burden is anticipated. For standard infranodal AV block, a dual-chamber pacemaker is typically preferred to preserve AV synchrony; if the patient has LVEF 36–50% and is expected to pace more than 40% of the time, physiologic pacing strategies such as CRT or His-bundle pacing are favored over right ventricular apical pacing to mitigate pacing-induced cardiomyopathy, though operator expertise and anatomy influence modality choice and success rates [^113WQXpM] [^113WGYqs]. But wait, what if His-bundle pacing fails or is not feasible? Left bundle branch area pacing offers high success and stable thresholds across the spectrum of AV block and may be a reasonable alternative when His capture is not achievable, though randomized outcome data remain limited [^115YfUGi].

> I should double-check monitoring and diagnostic strategies when the diagnosis is uncertain or episodes are infrequent. Prolonged ambulatory monitoring with event monitors for 30–90 days or implantable loop recorders can establish symptom–rhythm correlation and detect progression; exercise testing may unmask infranodal block in 2:1 patterns, and electrophysiology study can localize the level of block and clarify risk when noninvasive data are inconclusive, particularly in 2:1 AV block where classification as Mobitz I versus II can be challenging on surface ECG [^115Zmt5u] [^116AGMUi] [^117WVE2k].

> Let me synthesize the recommendation and make sure I am not overstating anything. For intermittent Mobitz type II AV block not attributable to reversible or physiologic causes, permanent pacemaker implantation is a Class I indication regardless of symptoms, given the risk of abrupt progression to high-grade or complete AV block with unstable escape rhythms and the demonstrated survival benefit with pacing; intermittency does not negate this risk, and observation alone is inappropriate once the diagnosis is secure and reversible causes are excluded [^112XanjB] [^113x8wXN] [^1154h8VM]. Shared decision-making remains essential, with counseling on procedural risks, device choices, and follow-up, but the default evidence-based course is to proceed with pacing in this scenario [^113WQXpM].

> Finally, I should confirm practical next steps. Confirm the ECG diagnosis and exclude reversible causes, obtain echocardiography to assess for structural heart disease, and if the diagnosis is uncertain or episodes are rare, use prolonged monitoring or EPS to substantiate infranodal disease. Once Mobitz II is confirmed and reversible etiologies are excluded, proceed with permanent pacing, favoring dual-chamber systems and considering physiologic pacing strategies when pacing burden is expected to be high or ventricular function is borderline, while tailoring device selection to anatomy, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^114VFN5L] [^113ibFfT] [^113WQXpM].

Permanent pacing is indicated for intermittent Mobitz II AV block **regardless of symptoms** because of the risk of sudden progression to complete heart block and adverse outcomes [^112XanjB] [^1154h8VM]. Pacing is not indicated only if a **reversible cause** is identified and corrected (e.g. drug toxicity, ischemia, electrolyte imbalance) [^111M2d6E]. For intermittent or uncertain cases, use ambulatory monitoring or electrophysiology study to confirm infranodal block and guide pacing decisions [^115Zmt5u] [^117WVE2k]. If Mobitz II is confirmed, implant a dual-chamber pacemaker; consider CRT or His-bundle pacing if significant ventricular pacing is expected or if conduction disease is extensive [^113WQXpM] [^113WGYqs].

## Indications for permanent pacing in intermittent Mobitz II AV block

According to the 2018 ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines, **permanent pacing is recommended** for acquired second-degree Mobitz II AV block not attributable to reversible or physiologic causes, regardless of symptoms [^112XanjB] [^115zxLEo]. This recommendation is based on the risk of progression to complete heart block, syncope, and sudden cardiac death [^116i2xcZ] [^116C3MPJ].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation and monitoring

Accurate diagnosis and monitoring are essential to distinguish Mobitz II from other AV block types and to guide appropriate management. The following diagnostic tools are recommended:

- **Electrocardiography (ECG)**: Essential for initial diagnosis and differentiation between Mobitz I and Mobitz II AV block [^116AGMUi].

- **Ambulatory ECG monitoring**: Holter or event monitors are useful for detecting intermittent Mobitz II block and correlating symptoms with arrhythmia episodes [^117WVE2k].

- **Electrophysiology study (EPS)**: Recommended in selected patients to determine the level of block and guide pacing decisions, particularly in intermittent or unclear cases [^117WVE2k].

---

## Reversible causes and exceptions

Permanent pacing is not indicated if Mobitz II AV block is due to **reversible causes**. Common reversible causes include:

- **Drug toxicity**: Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, or antiarrhythmic medications [^111BP3pb].

- **Electrolyte imbalances**: Hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, or other electrolyte disturbances [^111egJ7J].

- **Acute ischemia**: Myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome [^112uByVh].

- **Inflammatory or infectious conditions**: Lyme disease, myocarditis, or other transient inflammatory states [^111M2d6E].

In these cases, the underlying cause should be identified and corrected before considering permanent pacing [^114VFN5L].

---

## Prognostic implications and risks

Intermittent Mobitz II AV block carries significant prognostic implications, including:

- **Progression to complete heart block**: High risk of progression, which can lead to syncope, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death [^114gTbJ5].

- **Increased mortality**: Untreated Mobitz II AV block is associated with increased mortality, particularly in patients with structural heart disease or conduction system disease [^116C3MPJ].

- **Syncope and presyncope**: Common symptoms associated with intermittent Mobitz II block, indicating hemodynamic instability [^116C3MPJ].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

The 2018 ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines provide clear recommendations for permanent pacing in intermittent Mobitz II AV block:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** | **Class of recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Acquired Mobitz II AV block not attributable to reversible causes | Permanent pacing recommended | Class I |
| Reversible causes identified and corrected | Permanent pacing not indicated | Class III |
| Intermittent Mobitz II AV block with confirmed infranodal block | Permanent pacing recommended | Class I |
| Asymptomatic Mobitz II AV block with narrow QRS complex | Permanent pacing reasonable | Class IIa |

---

## Pacemaker device selection and programming considerations

When permanent pacing is indicated for intermittent Mobitz II AV block, the following device selection and programming considerations are recommended:

- **Dual-chamber pacemaker**: Preferred over single-chamber pacing to maintain AV synchrony and reduce the risk of atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and pacemaker syndrome [^notfound].

- **Physiologic pacing strategies**: Consider His-bundle pacing or left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP) in patients with extensive conduction disease or anticipated high ventricular pacing burden to preserve physiologic ventricular activation [^113WQXpM] [^115YfUGi].

- **Ventricular pacing minimization algorithms**: Useful in patients with intermittent AV block to reduce unnecessary ventricular pacing and associated complications [^notfound].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring protocols

Regular follow-up and monitoring are essential to ensure optimal pacemaker function and detect progression of conduction disease. Recommended follow-up includes:

- **Regular clinic visits**: Every 6–12 months for device interrogation, threshold testing, and assessment of pacing burden [^notfound].

- **Remote monitoring**: Utilize remote monitoring systems to detect arrhythmias, device malfunctions, or progression of conduction disease [^115Zmt5u].

- **Patient education**: Educate patients on symptoms of progression, device malfunction, and emergency procedures [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Permanent pacing is indicated for intermittent Mobitz II AV block **regardless of symptoms**, given the risk of progression to complete heart block and adverse outcomes. Pacing is not indicated only when a reversible cause is identified and corrected. Accurate diagnosis, monitoring, and follow-up are essential to optimize outcomes.

### Vagally mediated atrioventricular block: pathophysiology and diagnosis [^1131hUAr]. Heart (2013). Low credibility.

Vagally mediated atrioventricular (AV) block is defined as a paroxysmal AV block, localised within the AV node, associated with slowing of the sinus rate. All types of second-degree AV block, including pseudo-Mobitz II block, and complete AV block, may be present. Most of the patients have normal AV conduction. Differential diagnosis with intrinsic AV block is based on the behaviour of the sinus rate. Vagally mediated AV block is benign; it can be recorded as an asymptomatic or symptomatic event (syncope/presyncope). Syncope due to this form of AV block should be diagnosed and managed as neurally mediated syncope. When this block is fortuitously recorded in asymptomatic patients, pacemaker implantation is not indicated.

ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia guideline — supportive details for AV block testing: In patients with second-degree AV block, differentiation between Mobitz type I and Mobitz type II is important, and severe first-degree AV block (PR > 0.30 s) with a narrow QRS usually indicates atrioventricular node delay. For intermittent symptoms, event monitors worn for 30 to 90 days and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators left in place for > 2 years tend to have greater diagnostic yield than 24- to 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, and in 1 study atrioventricular block as a cause of syncope was more common with structural heart disease (34% versus 13%). An exercise treadmill stress test may help differentiate whether 2:1 AV block is Mobitz type I or II or identify infranodal disease. In second-degree AV block with concomitant bundle branch block, the block is likely but not necessarily infra-His (70% likelihood), and with 2:1 AV block plus bundle branch block, 15% to 20% can have block in the atrioventricular node.

### Left bundle branch area pacing in patients with atrioventricular conduction disease: a prospective multicenter study [^115YfUGi]. Heart Rhythm (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The reported success rate of His-bundle pacing (HBP) in patients with infranodal atrioventricular (AV) conduction disease is only 52%-76%. The success rate of left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP) in this cohort is not well studied.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and electrophysiological characteristics of LBBAP in patients with AV conduction disease.

Methods

Patients with AV conduction disease referred for pacemaker implantation at 2 centers between February 2019 and June 2021 were considered for LBBAP. Baseline demographic characteristics, procedural success rates, electrophysiological parameters, and complications were assessed.

Results

LBBAP was successful in 340 of 364 patients (93%). Mean age was 72 ± 13 years, and mean follow-up was 331 ± 244 days. Pacing indications were Mobitz I in 27 patients (7%), Mobitz II or 2:1 AV block or high-grade AV block in 94 patients (26%), complete heart block in 199 patients (55%), and sick sinus syndrome with isolated bundle branch block in 44 patients (12%). Left bundle branch block and right bundle branch block were present in 57 patients (16%) and 140 patients (38%), respectively. Procedural success rates did not differ between indications (92.6%, 93.6%, 92.9%, and 95%, respectively) or between patients with narrow (< 120 ms) vs wide QRS (≥ 120 ms). Mean LBBAP threshold was 0.77 ± 0.34 V at 0.4 ms at implant and remained stable during follow-up. There were 4 (1.2%) acute LBBAP lead dislodgments.

Conclusion

LBBAP is safe and feasible with high success rates for patients with AV conduction disease. In contrast to HBP, LBBAP success rates remain high over the entire spectrum of AV conduction disease, and lead parameters remain stable during follow-up.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Additional testing for chronic therapy/management of atrioventricular block — In first-degree or second-degree Mobitz type I atrioventricular block, the need for pacemaker implantation is symptom driven, and prolonged monitoring increases diagnostic yield: event monitors, worn for 30 to 90 days, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), which can be left in place for > 2 years, tend to have greater diagnostic yield than 24- to 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. In 1 study, atrioventricular block as a cause for syncope was more commonly identified in structural heart disease versus without (34% versus 13%), and monitors can assess QRS morphology changes such as alternating bundle branch block, with the type of monitor depending on symptom frequency.

General principles — supportive considerations for nodal atrioventricular block: First‑ and second‑degree Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) AV blocks (or 2:1 AV block at the AV node) are typically benign in that they do not progress significantly to complete heart block, and treatment with a pacemaker is typically reserved for significant symptoms that affect quality of life (QOL); occasionally second‑degree Mobitz type I block is infranodal and in those instances a pacemaker may be considered even in the absence of symptoms. Although a narrow QRS suggests nodal block, infranodal disease can be revealed during an electrophysiology study (EPS), and ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring or a treadmill exercise test may be useful to correlate symptoms. If symptoms do not clearly correspond to episodes of AV block, the risks associated with a pacemaker in the absence of clear benefit make the overall risk‑benefit ratio unfavorable; in long‑standing persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) with a low heart rate and appropriate chronotropic response, pacing for rate support is unlikely to be beneficial, and although PPM implantation is relatively low risk, procedural complications and death can occur and leads have long‑term management implications.

### Significance of alectinib-induced bradycardia: rhythm and reversibility matter more than rate [^1132p5Rd]. JACC: CardioOncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Second, the Pruis et alwork provides reassurance that the bradycardia observed with alectinib may be notable but is rarely life altering and, to date, never life ending. Given the amount of electrocardiographic data Pruis et al had in this study, it would have been helpful if they were more explicit about some details. Based on the electrocardiographic data in Supplemental Table 3, because PQ intervals are reported on all patients except in 1 with atrial fibrillation and another time for 1 patient in supraventricular tachycardia, we assume that all patients were in sinus rhythm, although patients in an ectopic atrial rhythm can have a PQ interval. In the results, they note ". (no) other conduction changes were observed". Taken together, we assume that, except in 1 patient with atrial fibrillation, all "bradycardia" in the study was sinus bradycardia as opposed to other sinister forms of bradycardia like second-degree type II (Mobitz II) heart block, third-degree (complete) heart block, or ventricular escape rhythms. This distinction of the bradycardic rhythm is of critical importance. Evidence of second-degree type II heart block (Mobitz II), high-grade atrioventricular block, or third-degree (complete) heart block are Class I indications for a permanent pacemaker regardless of symptoms because without intervention the prognosis is poor. The rhythm in the patient who received a pacemaker was not specifically mentioned but only termed "symptomatic bradycardia". In the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Rhythm Society guidelines on the management of bradycardia, the threshold for the placement of a permanent pacemaker for sinus node dysfunction is higher, and symptom-rhythm correlation should be demonstrated.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for sarcoidosis, more specifically with respect to management of cardiac sarcoidosis, pacing, ACC/AHA/HRS 2019 guidelines recommend to consider performing permanent pacing, with additional defibrillator capability if needed and if the expected meaningful survival is > 1 year, in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis and second-degree Mobitz type II AV block, high-grade AV block, or third-degree AV block.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Atrioventricular block in adults — Class I indications for permanent pacemaker implantation are as follows: Permanent pacemaker implantation is indicated for third-degree and advanced second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block at any anatomic level associated with bradycardia with symptoms (including heart failure) or ventricular arrhythmias presumed to be due to AV block (Level of Evidence: C). It is indicated for third-degree and advanced second-degree AV block at any anatomic level associated with arrhythmias and other medical conditions that require drug therapy that results in symptomatic bradycardia (Level of Evidence: C). In awake, symptom-free patients in sinus rhythm, it is indicated for third-degree and advanced second-degree AV block at any anatomic level with documented periods of asystole greater than or equal to 3.0 seconds or any escape rate less than 40 bpm, or with an escape rhythm that is below the AV node (Level of Evidence: C). It is indicated for third-degree and advanced second-degree AV block at any anatomic level in awake, symptom-free patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and bradycardia with 1 or more pauses of at least 5 seconds or longer (Level of Evidence: C).

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Temporary pacing for atrioventricular block — For patients with second-degree or third-degree atrioventricular block associated with symptoms or hemodynamic compromise that is refractory to medical therapy, temporary transvenous pacing is reasonable to increase heart rate and improve symptoms. For patients who require prolonged temporary transvenous pacing, it is reasonable to choose an externalized permanent active fixation lead over a standard passive fixation temporary pacing lead. For patients with second-degree or third-degree atrioventricular block and hemodynamic compromise refractory to antibradycardic medical therapy, temporary transcutaneous pacing may be considered until a temporary transvenous or permanent pacemaker is placed or the bradyarrhythmia resolves.

Regarding medical management for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to management of bradyarrhythmias, ACC/ACEP/AHA/NAEMSP/SCAI 2025 guidelines recommend to perform permanent pacing in patients presenting with an acute myocardial infarction with sustained evidence of second-degree Mobitz type II AV block, high-grade AV block, alternating bundle-branch block, or third-degree AV block (persistent or infranodal).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Imaging in patients with documented or suspected bradycardia or conduction disorders — In patients with newly identified left bundle branch block (LBBB), second-degree Mobitz type II atrioventricular block, high-grade atrioventricular block, or third-degree atrioventricular block with or without apparent structural heart disease or coronary artery disease, transthoracic echocardiography is recommended. In selected patients presenting with bradycardia or conduction disorders other than LBBB, second-degree Mobitz type II atrioventricular block, high-grade atrioventricular block, or third-degree atrioventricular block, transthoracic echocardiography is reasonable if structural heart disease is suspected. In selected patients with bradycardia or bundle branch block, disease-specific advanced imaging (eg, transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, or nuclear imaging) is reasonable if structural heart disease is suspected but not confirmed by other diagnostic modalities. In the evaluation of patients with asymptomatic sinus bradycardia or first-degree atrioventricular block and no clinical evidence of structural heart disease, routine cardiac imaging is not indicated.

### Complications and prognosis of patients undergoing apical or septal right ventricular pacing [^114JfLqc]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Consecutive patients undergoing pacemaker device implantation from 16 April 2010 to 29 September 2016 at the Edinburgh Heart Centre were included in the study. Over the study period, there were five operators with two favouring septal right ventricular lead placement and three favouring apical lead placement. All septal lead placements were achieved with active fixation leads using stylets fashioned by the operators to facilitate septal positioning. No preshaped stylets or steerable sheaths were used. The final septal positions were confirmed using fluoroscopy (posteroarterior (PA) and left anterior oblique (LAO) 40 projections) and assessment of the current of injury. In comparison, most apical lead placements were achieved with active fixation leads (n = 483, 78.4%) using PA and right anterior oblique fluoroscopy projections. Patients listed for permanent pacemakers were placed in a central pool and then non-selectively allocated to 1 of 6 weekly lists at our institution. Inclusion criteria were defined to select patients undergoing new right ventricular lead implantation (either new device implants or ventricular lead repositioning) for high-degree atrioventricular block (second/Mobitz type 2 or third-degree atrioventricular block). Exclusion criteria were pacemaker implantation for isolated sick sinus syndrome or other conditions associated with low ventricular pacing burdens and patients undergoing cardiac defibrillator or resynchronisation therapy system implantation. Patients in sinus rhythm undergoing single-lead device implantation were excluded in an attempt to exclude frail and unstable patients with an inherently poor prognosis who may be more likely to have an apical lead placed (figure 1). Clinical audit approval for this study was provided by the Edinburgh Heart Centre.

### Pregnancy maternal fetal outcomes among pregnancies complicated with atrioventricular block [^1128UPZL]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Maternal cardiac complications

In general, with the increase in the degree of AVB, the complications and mortality of patients increased. Most pregnant patients with I° AVB were asymptomatic and did not have significant complications. While the treatment was not necessary for these patients, regular evaluation is essential because the risk of atrial fibrillation and development of higher degree AVB increases with the growth of gestational age. In our study, no patient in this group needs the placement of a pacemaker.

Regarding II° AVB, the block may be temporary or permanent depending on the impairment of the conduction system and divided into two types (Mobitz type I and Mobitz type II). Patients with II° AVB may be asymptomatic or have symptoms like syncope and lightheadedness. Of note, Mobitz type II block has the potential for progressing to a complete heart block, which may result in death if unrecognized. Previous study reported that a patient with type II of II° AVB identified at 24 gestational weeks. She had symptoms of palpitations and fatigue and experienced episodes of asystole, and the longest episode lasted for 15.8 s. In our study, other mild arrhythmias were also frequently present in the patient with II° AVB type I AV block. But the severe arrhythmias including PVC and PVC + APB were observed in second-degree type II AV block. Therefore, patients with II° AVB type II have high risk for more unexpected complications, which may change and progress rapidly during pregnancy and lead to adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes.

### HRS / EHRA / APHRS expert consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of patients with inherited primary arrhythmia syndromes: document endorsed by HRS, EHRA, and APHRS in may 2013 and by ACCF, AHA, PACES, and AEPC in June 2013 [^112DKwyK]. Heart Rhythm (2013). Medium credibility.

Progressive cardiac conduction disease (PCCD) therapeutic interventions include Class I and Class IIa recommendations. Class I: pacemaker implantation is recommended in PCCD with intermittent or permanent third-degree or high-grade atrioventricular (AV) block, or symptomatic Mobitz I or II second-degree AV block. Class IIa: pacemaker implantation can be useful in PCCD with bifascicular block with or without first-degree AV block, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation can be useful in adult patients with a mutation in the lamin A/C gene with left ventricular dysfunction and/or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT).

### Is mobitz type I atrioventricular block benign in adults? [^113VWVaD]. Heart (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the need for pacing in adults with chronic Mobitz type I second degree atrioventricular block (Mobitz I).

Design

Prospective study.

Setting

District general hospital.

Patients

147 subjects aged ≥ 20 years (age cohorts 20–44, 45–64, 65–79, and ≥ 80) with chronic Mobitz I without second degree Mobitz II or third degree (higher degree) block on entry, seen from 1968 to 1993 and followed up to 30 June 1997. Sixty four had organic heart disease. The presence of symptomatic bradycardia was defined as highly likely in 47 patients (class 1); probable in 14 (class 2); and absent in 86 (class 3).

Main Outcome Measures

The main outcome measure was death, with conduction deterioration to higher degree block or symptomatic bradycardia the alternative measure.

Results

Five year survival to death was reduced in unpaced patients relative to that expected for the normal population (overall mean (SD) 53.5 (6.7)% v 68.6%, p < 0.001; class 3, 54.4 (7.3)% v 70.1%, p < 0.001). Paced patients fared better than unpaced (overall (mean (SD) five year survival 76.3 (4.5)% v 53.5 (6.7)%, p = 0.0014; class 3, 87.2 (5.4)% v 54.4 (7.3)%, p = 0.020; and organic heart disease, 68.2 (7.6)% v 44.0 (9.9)%, p ≤ 0.0014). There were no deaths in the < 45 cohort. Survival to first outcome (main or alternative) was further reduced to 31.7 (5.0)% in 102 patients unpaced initially and 34.2 (5.7)% in class 3. Only the 20–44 cohort and patients with sinus arrhythmia had > 50% survival.

Conclusion

Mobitz I block is not usually benign in patients ≥ 45 years of age. Pacemaker implantation should be considered, even in the absence of symptomatic bradycardia or organic heart disease.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Top 10 take-home messages for the management of bradycardia and cardiac conduction delay — The presence of nocturnal bradycardias should prompt consideration for screening for sleep apnea, beginning with solicitation of suspicious symptoms, but nocturnal bradycardia is not in itself an indication for permanent pacing. The presence of left bundle branch block on electrocardiogram markedly increases the likelihood of underlying structural heart disease and of diagnosing left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and echocardiography is usually the most appropriate initial screening test for structural heart disease, including left ventricular systolic dysfunction. In sinus node dysfunction, there is no established minimum heart rate or pause duration where permanent pacing is recommended, and establishing temporal correlation between symptoms and bradycardia is important when determining whether permanent pacing is needed. In patients with acquired second-degree Mobitz type II atrioventricular block, high-grade atrioventricular block, or third-degree atrioventricular block not caused by reversible or physiologic causes, permanent pacing is recommended regardless of symptoms, whereas for all other types of atrioventricular block permanent pacing should generally be considered only in the presence of symptoms that correlate with atrioventricular block. In patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction between 36% to 50% and atrioventricular block who are expected to require ventricular pacing > 40% of the time, techniques that provide more physiologic ventricular activation (eg, cardiac resynchronization therapy, His bundle pacing) are preferred to right ventricular pacing to prevent heart failure. Because conduction system abnormalities are common after transcatheter aortic valve replacement, recommendations on postprocedure surveillance and pacemaker implantation are made in this guideline. In patients with bradycardia who have indications for pacemaker implantation, shared decision-making and patient-centered care are endorsed and emphasized, and treatment decisions are based on the best available evidence and on the patient's goals of care and preferences. Using the principles of shared decision-making and informed consent/refusal, patients with decision-making capacity or his/her legally defined surrogate has the right to refuse or request withdrawal of pacemaker therapy, even if the patient is pacemaker dependent, which should be considered palliative, end-of-life care, and not physician-assisted suicide. Identifying patient populations that will benefit the most from emerging pacing technologies will require further investigation as these modalities are incorporated into clinical practice.

Case introduction

All procedures performed in this study adhere to the ethical standards of the institution and/or National Research Council guidelines, and the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki (2013 revision). Written informed consent was obtained from the patient to publish this case report along with accompanying images. Copies of the written consent are available for review by the editorial board.

The patient, an 83-year-old man, was hospitalized due to recurrent syncope episodes over the past two years. Initially, he experienced sudden dizziness and weakness with subsequent loss of consciousness, followed by spontaneous recovery after a few minutes without significant discomfort. Similar intermittent episodes occurred intermittently thereafter. Echocardiography revealed left atrial enlargement with normal left ventricular systolic function. Coronary angiography indicated coronary atherosclerosis. Head MRI + MRA showed an old lacunar infarct in the left lateral ventricle and pontine area, alongside intracranial atherosclerosis. Electroencephalogram results were unremarkable. Holter ECG monitoring confirmed sinus rhythm with intermittent second-degree type I atrioventricular block, prompting a Class IIa recommendation for pacemaker implantation. Further electrophysiological examination was advised to pinpoint the site of block or to implant an ICM to monitor cardiac events during syncope. The patient opted for ICM implantation, which revealed evidence linking intermittent high-degree atrioventricular block to his syncope episodes. Given the risks of syncope and potential progression to permanent atrioventricular block, the patient's pacing indication was upgraded to Class I, necessitating pacemaker implantation. Due to the patient's advanced age, slender physique, limited life expectancy, and low anticipated ventricular pacing requirement, Micra AV was chosen and implanted via femoral vein.

Adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) — management of bradycardia includes COR I recommendations that in adults with ACHD and symptomatic SND or chronotropic incompetence, atrial based permanent pacing is recommended; in adults with ACHD and symptomatic bradycardia related to atrioventricular block, permanent pacing is recommended; in adults with congenital complete atrioventricular block with any symptomatic bradycardia, a wide QRS escape rhythm, mean daytime heart rate below 50 bpm, complex ventricular ectopy, or ventricular dysfunction, permanent pacing is recommended; and in adults with ACHD and postoperative second-degree Mobitz type II atrioventricular block, high-grade atrioventricular block, or third-degree atrioventricular block that is not expected to resolve, permanent pacing is recommended. COR IIa recommendations state that in asymptomatic adults with congenital complete atrioventricular block, permanent pacing is reasonable; in adults with repaired ACHD who require permanent pacing for bradycardic indications, a bradycardia device with atrial antitachycardia pacing capabilities is reasonable; and in adults with ACHD with preexisting sinus node and/or atrioventricular conduction disease who are undergoing cardiac surgery, intraoperative placement of epicardial permanent pacing leads is reasonable. A COR IIb recommendation notes that in adults with ACHD and pacemakers, atrial-based permanent pacing for the prevention of atrial arrhythmias may be considered.

Arrhythmias — In HT recipients, permanent pacing is recommended regardless of symptoms in HT recipients with second-degree Mobitz type II atrioventricular block, high-grade atrioventricular block, or third-degree atrioventricular block (Class I, Level of Evidence: B). Dual chamber pacing is recommended over single chamber ventricular pacing in HT recipients with sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular block who require permanent pacing (Class I, Level of Evidence: A). Permanent pacing is reasonable in HT recipients with marked first-degree or second-degree Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) atrioventricular block with symptoms that are attributable to the atrioventricular block (Class IIa, Level of Evidence: C). In patients with atrioventricular block who have an indication for permanent pacing with a LVEF between 36% and 50% and are expected to require ventricular pacing more than 40% of the time, it is reasonable to choose pacing methods that maintain physiologic ventricular activation (e.g. CRT or His bundle pacing) over right ventricular pacing (Class IIa, Level of Evidence: B). In patients with a heart transplant and severe allograft vasculopathy with LV dysfunction, an ICD may be reasonable if meaningful survival of greater than 1 year is expected (Class IIb, Level of Evidence: C).

Top 10 take-home messages for bradycardia and cardiac conduction delay — key points include that sinus node dysfunction is most often related to age-dependent progressive fibrosis causing bradycardic or pause-related syndromes. Both sleep disorders of breathing and nocturnal bradycardias are relatively common; treatment of sleep apnea not only reduces the frequency of these arrhythmias but also may offer cardiovascular benefits, the presence of nocturnal bradycardias should prompt consideration for screening for sleep apnea, and nocturnal bradycardia is not in itself an indication for permanent pacing. The presence of left bundle branch block on electrocardiogram markedly increases the likelihood of underlying structural heart disease and of diagnosing left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and echocardiography is usually the most appropriate initial screening test for structural heart disease, including left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Immediate postprocedure transvenous pacing after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is described with risk thresholds and monitoring guidance: In patients deemed high risk for conduction disturbances, it is reasonable to either maintain the pre-existing temporary pacemaker in the right internal jugular vein or insert one into that vein if the femoral vein has been used for rapid pacing. Procedural conduction disturbances and postimplant 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) guide whether to place a temporary but durable pacing lead; three scenarios are specified: no new conduction disturbances (< 20 ms change in PR or QRS duration), new-onset left bundle branch block (LBBB) and/or increase in PR or QRS duration ≥ 20 ms, and development of transient or persistent complete heart block. In patients with normal sinus rhythm and no new conduction disturbances on an ECG performed immediately postprocedure, the risk of developing delayed atrioventricular (AV) block is < 1%, and in these cases the temporary pacemaker and central venous sheath can be removed immediately postprocedure with continuous cardiac monitoring for 24 hours and a repeat 12-lead ECG the following day recommended; this also applies to pre-existing first-degree AV block and/or pre-existing LBBB if PR or QRS intervals do not increase after the procedure. Rapid atrial pacing up to 120 beats per minute using the temporary pacemaker electrode predicted need for permanent pacing, with a higher rate within 30 days when second-degree Mobitz I (Wenckebach) AV block occurred (13.1% vs. 1.3%; p < 0.001), and a negative predictive value for permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation of 98.7% in those without Wenckebach AV block. Patients receiving self-expanding valves required permanent pacing more frequently than those receiving a balloon-expandable valve (15.9% vs. 3.7%; p = 0.001).

In patients with exertional symptoms who have first-degree or second-degree Mobitz type I AV block at rest, an exercise treadmill test is reasonable to determine whether they may benefit from permanent pacing. In selected patients with second-degree AV block, an electrophysiology study (EPS) may be considered to determine the level of the block and to determine whether they may benefit from permanent pacing. In selected patients with second-degree AV block, carotid sinus massage and/or pharmacologic challenge with atropine, isoproterenol, or procainamide may be considered to determine the level of the block and to determine whether they may benefit from permanent pacing.

### Abstract… [^116arAsF]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

When Should Pacemakers Be Used in Patients with Heart Failure. Cardiac resynchronization therapy is indicated in patients with New York Heart Association class II to IV heart failure and a QRS duration greater than 150 milliseconds. There is insufficient evidence for CRT in patients with NYHA class I heart failure. Evidence does not support CRT in patients with a QRS of 120 to 150 milliseconds. A combination of CRT and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator reduces overall mortality rates compared with an ICD alone in patients who have indications for both. 1, 7, 19–22. 23 CRT improves the synchronicity between ventricles.

A 2007 meta-analysis that included patients with NYHA class III or IV heart failure who had a left ventricular ejection fraction of 21% to 30% and a QRS of 155 to 209 milliseconds showed a significant reduction in hospitalization and overall mortality rates, and an improvement of at least one NYHA class when CRT was added to optimal medical management.
19. There is also evidence that patients who have less symptomatic heart failure benefit from CRT. A 2011 meta-analysis found that patients with heart failure of any NYHA class had lower mortality and heart failure hospitalization rates with CRT compared with other interventions. 20 All-cause mortality was reduced in patients who underwent CRT, with an absolute risk reduction of 4. 7% and a number needed to treat of 24 for NYHA class I or II, and an absolute risk reduction of
2. 5% and a number needed to treat of 40 for NYHA class III or IV.

Although the inclusion criteria varied among the evaluated trials, patients in the most heavily weighted trial had a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 30%. Approximately 80% of patients had NYHA class II heart failure, 20% had class III, and the mean QRS was 157 milliseconds. 21 Given the limited NYHA class I population in the trials, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of CRT in these patients. 7, 20. Because many patients have indications for both CRT and an ICD, a separate meta-analysis investigated whether a combination of these interventions improved overall mortality rates. 25 When comparing ICD alone with ICD plus CRT, the study found an absolute risk reduction of 4% with a number needed to treat of 25 for overall mortality when the combination is used.

Outcomes

The outcomes of interest for the current analysis were bradyarrhythmia, AF, syncope, pacemaker implantation, sudden cardiovascular death, cardiovascular death, and all-cause death. Bradyarrhythmias were adjudicated by an experienced physician with access to electrocardiography and health records. In cases of suspected bradyarrhythmia during remote monitoring, a clinician phoned the participant to collect further details including symptoms. Physiological findings were discarded based the physician's best judgment. This included asymptomatic episodes of sinus bradycardia, pause, arrest, or first-degree AVB or second-degree AVB Mobitz type I during sleep with asystole not lasting longer than 3.5 seconds and heart rate not dropping below 30 beats per minute during 8 consecutive beats. Adjudicated bradyarrhythmias were classified as one of (1) SND defined as inadequate heart rate compared with physiologic need due to sinus bradycardia, pause or arrest, exit block, or chronotropic incompetence; (2) low-grade AVB defined as first- or second-degree heart block with a P:QRS ratio of 2:1 or lower; or (3) high-grade AVB defined as complete heart block or second-degree heart block with a P:QRS ratio of at least 3:1. The first bradyarrhythmia episode per participant was adjudicated and its associated symptoms and treatment recorded, whereas any recurrent bradyarrhythmia episodes were also adjudicated if classified or treated differently than the incident episode. AF diagnoses were adjudicated as part of the main trial. Syncope was adjudicated by an experienced physician and was defined as a sudden and transient complete loss of consciousness with inability to maintain upright posture, without seizure or preceding trauma. All pacemaker implantations were recorded, while implanted cardioverter-defibrillator or cardiac resynchronization therapy without bradyarrhythmia as an indication were not considered. Deaths were adjudicated according to cardiovascular death and sudden death.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Management of bradycardia in patients with an acute MI — In patients presenting with an acute MI, temporary pacing is indicated for medically refractory symptomatic or hemodynamically significant bradycardia related to SND or atrioventricular block. Patients who present with SND or atrioventricular block in the setting of an acute MI should undergo a waiting period before determining the need for permanent pacing. In patients presenting with an acute MI with second-degree Mobitz type II atrioventricular block, high-grade atrioventricular block, alternating bundle branch block, or third-degree atrioventricular block (persistent or infranodal), permanent pacing is indicated after a waiting period. In patients with an acute MI with symptomatic or hemodynamically significant sinus bradycardia or atrioventricular block at the level of the atrioventricular node, the administration of atropine is reasonable. In patients with an acute MI and transient atrioventricular block that resolves, permanent pacing should not be performed. In patients with an acute MI and a new bundle branch block or isolated fascicular block in the absence of second-degree or third-degree atrioventricular block, permanent pacing should not be performed.

Atrioventricular block — ambulatory monitoring and symptom correlation highlight that in patients with first-degree atrioventricular block or second-degree Mobitz type I atrioventricular block, the need for pacemaker implantation is symptom driven, and event monitors, worn for 30 to 90 days, and ICDs, which can be left in place for > 2 years, tend to have greater diagnostic yield than 24- to 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. In 1 study, atrioventricular block was more commonly identified as a cause for syncope in those patients with structural heart disease compared with patients without structural heart disease (34% versus 13%). The type of monitor chosen will depend on the frequency of symptoms, and monitors can be used to look for changes in QRS morphology such as alternating bundle branch block; although Mobitz type I atrioventricular block is usually associated with a narrow QRS and Mobitz type II atrioventricular block most often has a wide QRS, in some cases Mobitz type I atrioventricular block and an associated narrow QRS can be attributable to infranodal block.

### Indications for pacing in the treatment of bradyarrhythmias… [^113anU1N]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Phibbs B, Friedman HS, Graboys TB, et al. Indications for Pacing in the Treatment of Bradyarrhythmias: Report of an Independent Study Group. JAMA. 1984; 252: 1307–1311. doi: 10.1001/jama.1984.03350100037026 Indications for permanent pacing in the bradyarrhythmias are summarized. In the absence of symptoms, pacing is justified only when Mobitz type II block or complete atrioventricular block is localized in the bundlebranch system. All other abnormalities of impulse generation or conduction must be shown to be stable and intrinsic and to cause CNS symptoms or hemodynamic compromise to justify pacing. Isolated intra-Hisian abnormality without failure of AV conduction is benign. Measurement of HV interval does not contribute significant information. Correlation of carotid sinus sensitivity with carotid sinus syncope is poor.

Bradyarrhythmia produced by minimal effective doses of an essential drug is a rare indication for pacing and requires special documentation. Inadequate indications, sources of error, and misconceptions are discussed. Generally, it is important to exclude drug effect, transient clinical states, and correctable systemic disease as causes of the abnormality before making a conclusion about pacing.

Bradycardia guideline top take-home messages — In patients with sleep-related bradycardia, "the presence of nocturnal bradycardias should prompt consideration for screening for sleep apnea", yet "nocturnal bradycardia is not in itself an indication for permanent pacing". The presence of left bundle branch block on electrocardiogram "markedly increases the likelihood of underlying structural heart disease", and "echocardiography is usually the most appropriate initial screening test". In sinus node dysfunction, "there is no established minimum heart rate or pause duration where permanent pacing is recommended", and "establishing temporal correlation between symptoms and bradycardia is important" when deciding on pacing. For atrioventricular block, in acquired second-degree Mobitz type II, high‑grade, or third‑degree block not due to reversible or physiologic causes, "permanent pacing is recommended regardless of symptoms", whereas for other AV block types, pacing "should generally be considered only in the presence of symptoms that correlate with atrioventricular block". In patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction "between 36% to 50%" with AV block who are expected to require ventricular pacing " > 40% of the time", techniques providing more physiologic activation (eg, cardiac resynchronization therapy, His bundle pacing) "are preferred to right ventricular pacing to prevent heart failure". After transcatheter aortic valve replacement, conduction abnormalities are common and "recommendations on postoperative surveillance and pacemaker implantation are made in this guideline". For pacemaker implantation, "shared decision-making and patient-centered care are endorsed and emphasized", and decisions are based on "the best available evidence and on the patient's goals of care and preferences". Using shared decision-making and informed consent/refusal, patients or legally defined surrogates "has the right to refuse or request withdrawal of pacemaker therapy, even if the patient is pacemaker dependent", which "should be considered palliative, end-of-life care, and not physician-assisted suicide". Identification of patients who will benefit most from emerging pacing technologies (eg, His bundle pacing, transcatheter leadless pacing systems) "will require further investigation".

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Atrioventricular block — supportive evidence for permanent pacing and special populations is summarized as follows: Infranodal atrioventricular block regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms warrants a pacemaker. Observational data show benefit with pacing, including that there are observational studies that have demonstrated a mortality benefit with pacing therapy and that a 5-year survival benefit was shown in patients with second-degree Mobitz type II and 2:1 block. In neuromuscular disease, up to 20% of patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 have evidence of atrioventricular block on ECG or on 24-hour ambulatory monitoring, and one study found that 46.7% of patients with an HV interval ≥ 70 ms developed high-grade atrioventricular block; a large retrospective study showed a 75% lower risk of sudden death in those with a pacemaker. When atrioventricular block is assessed in atrial fibrillation (AF), retrospective studies have had conflicting results: in 1 study, pauses > 3 seconds were mostly asymptomatic, while in the other 2 studies, most pauses > 3 seconds were symptomatic; in asymptomatic patients there is no specific pause duration that warrants permanent pacing. Drug effects are relevant because atrioventricular block can develop secondary to drugs such as amiodarone or sotalol, and the benefit of any medication that exacerbates atrioventricular block must be balanced with potentially deleterious effects of right ventricular pacing. In cardiac sarcoidosis, systemic corticosteroids have reported a response rate in the 30% to 60% range, and in 1 study of 30 patients, 5 had atrioventricular block with treatment outcomes differing by timing: 2 of the 3 who received corticosteroids within 30 days had complete resolution, whereas both of the 2 who received corticosteroids > 30 days had persistent atrioventricular block.

The year 2024 marks the centenary of Mobitz's description of type II second-degree atrioventricular block. Its definition remains valid to this day with only minor modification for the diagnosis of infranodal conduction block. Mobitz a century ago indicated that his type II atrioventricular block was associated with Stock-Adams attacks and a prolonged duration of the QRS complex before the eventual description of bundle branch block.

### Contemporary practice pattern of permanent pacing for conduction disorders in inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction [^116B6FAZ]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Currently, there is no clear consensus regarding the optimal waiting period before permanent pacemaker implantation in patients with conduction disorders following an inferior myocardial infarction.

Hypothesis

We aimed to elucidate the contemporary practice pattern of pacing, especially the timing of pacemaker implantation, for sinoatrial node and atrioventricular (AV) conduction disorders following an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Methods

Using the National Inpatient Sample database from 2010 to 2014, we identified patients with a primary diagnosis of inferior STEMI. Primary conduction disorders were classified into: (a) high-degree AV block (HDAVB) consisting of complete AV block or Mobitz-type II second-degree AV block, (b) sinoatrial node dysfunction (SND), and (c) no major conduction disorders.

Results

Among 66961 patients, 2706 patients (4.0%) had HDAVB, which mostly consisted of complete AV block (2594 patients). SND was observed in 393 patients (0.6%). Among the 2706 patients with HDAVB, 267 patients (9.9%) underwent permanent pacemaker. In patients with HDAVB, more than one-third (34.9%) of permanent pacemakers were placed within 72hours after admission. The median interval from admission to permanent pacemaker implantation was 3 days (interquartile range; 2–5 days) for HDAVB vs 4 days (3–6 days) for SND (P < .001). HDAVB was associated with increased in-hospital mortality, whereas SND was not.

Conclusions

In patients who developed HDAVB following an inferior STEMI, only one in 10 patients underwent permanent pacemaker implantation. Despite its highly reversible nature, permanent pacemakers were implanted relatively early.

Atrioventricular block — indications for permanent pacemaker implantation include the following: Permanent pacemaker implantation is indicated for third-degree and advanced second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block at any anatomic level after catheter ablation of the AV junction. Permanent pacemaker implantation is indicated for third-degree and advanced second-degree AV block at any anatomic level associated with postoperative AV block that is not expected to resolve after cardiac surgery. Permanent pacemaker implantation is indicated for third-degree and advanced second-degree AV block at any anatomic level associated with neuromuscular diseases with AV block, such as myotonic muscular dystrophy, Kearns-Sayre syndrome, Erb dystrophy (limb-girdle muscular dystrophy), and peroneal muscular atrophy, with or without symptoms. Permanent pacemaker implantation is indicated for second-degree AV block with associated symptomatic bradycardia regardless of type or site of block. Permanent pacemaker implantation is indicated for asymptomatic persistent third-degree AV block at any anatomic site with average awake ventricular rates of 40 bpm or faster if cardiomegaly or LV dysfunction is present or if the site of block is below the AV node. Permanent pacemaker implantation is indicated for second- or third-degree AV block during exercise in the absence of myocardial ischemia.

Top 10 take-home messages — left bundle branch block and atrioventricular block evaluation state that the presence of left bundle branch block on electrocardiogram markedly increases the likelihood of underlying structural heart disease and of diagnosing left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and echocardiography is usually the most appropriate initial screening test for structural heart disease, including left ventricular systolic dysfunction. In patients with acquired second-degree Mobitz type II atrioventricular block, high-grade atrioventricular block, or third-degree atrioventricular block not caused by reversible or physiologic causes, permanent pacing is recommended regardless of symptoms, whereas for all other types of atrioventricular block, in the absence of conditions associated with progressive atrioventricular conduction abnormalities, permanent pacing should generally be considered only in the presence of symptoms that correlate with atrioventricular block.

### Indications and recommendations for pacemaker therapy… [^111egJ7J]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

First-degree and type I second-degree AV block usually are caused by delayed conduction in the AV node irrespective of QRS duration. Type II second-degree AV block usually is infra-nodal, especially when the QRS is wide. Third-degree AV block may occur at any anatomic level. The decision to implant a pacemaker in a patient with abnormal AV conduction depends on the presence of symptoms related to bradycardia or ventricular arrhythmias and their prognostic implications. Observational studies over the years strongly suggest that permanent pacing improves survival in patients with complete AV block, especially if syncope has occurred. 2–5 Therefore, symptomatic third-degree AV block is a class I indication for permanent pacing, whereas asymptomatic third-degree AV block is a class IIa indication. More recently, it has been recognized that type II second-degree AV block may be a precursor to complete AV block.

6, 7 Type II second-degree AV block should be treated with a permanent pacemaker even in an asymptomatic patient, particularly if it is associated with fascicular block, which also is a class IIa recommendation. 8, 9 Small, observational studies have suggested that patients with left ventricular dysfunction and markedly prolonged PR interval may benefit from pacing with a shorter AV conduction time.
10. Some investigators recommend pacing therapy for asymptomatic bifascicular block if there is evidence of severe intraventricular conduction delay on electrophysiologic study. Patients with alternating bundle branch block have a high mortality rate and a significant incidence of sudden death if pacing therapy is not provided.
15. Before a decision is made to implant a pacemaker for AV block, it is important to exclude and correct reversible causes such as electrolyte abnormalities.

Some types of AV block can be expected to resolve and do not require pacing therapy; for example, perioperative block caused by hypothermia or inflammation near the AV junction as a result of a surgical procedure in that area, or AV block developing during the acute phase of Lyme disease. Although sinus node dysfunction is the most common reason for pacemaker implantation, 19 permanent pacing in these patients may not improve survival, despite symptom reduction and improvement in quality of life. 20, 21 Atrial-based pacing may be preferable in patients with sinus node dysfunction, 22 although conflicting data have been reported in various studies. A recent randomized trial 23 reported reduced risk of atrial fibrillation recurrence with dual-chamber pacing compared with ventricular-based pacing in patients with sinus node dysfunction. The main pacing recommendations for this syndrome are listed in Table 4. 1.

### Criteria for early pacemaker implantation in patients with postoperative heart block after congenital heart surgery [^116M8tuK]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidelines recommend observation for atrioventricular node recovery until postoperative days (POD) 7 to 10 before permanent pacemaker placement (PPM) in patients with heart block after congenital cardiac surgery. To aid in surgical decision-making for early PPM, we established criteria to identify patients at high risk of requiring PPM.

Methods

We reviewed all cases of second degree and complete heart block (CHB) on POD 0 from August 2009 through December 2018. A decision tree model was trained to predict the need for PPM amongst patients with persistent CHB and prospectively validated from January 2019 through March 2021. Separate models were developed for all patients on POD 0 and those without recovery by POD 4.

Results

Of the 139 patients with postoperative heart block, 68 required PPM. PPM was associated with older age (3.2 versus 1.0 years; P = 0.018) and persistent CHB on POD 0 (versus intermittent CHB or second degree heart block; 87% versus 58%; P = 0.001). Median days [IQR] to atrioventricular node recovery was 2 [0–5] and PPM was 9 [6–11]. Of the 100 cases of persistent CHB (21 in the validation cohort), 59 (59%) required PPM. A decision tree model identified 4 risk factors for PPM in patients with persistent CHB: (1) aortic valve replacement, subaortic stenosis repair, or Konno procedure; (2) ventricular L-looping; (3) atrioventricular valve replacement; (4) and absence of preoperative antiarrhythmic agent (in POD 0 model only). The POD 4 model specificity was 0.89 [0.67–0.99] and positive predictive value was 0.94 [95% CI 0.81–0.98], which was stable in prospective validation (positive predictive value 1.0).

Conclusions

A data-driven analysis led to actionable criteria to identify patients requiring PPM. Patients with left ventricular outflow tract surgery, atrioventricular valve replacement, or ventricular L-Looping could be considered for PPM on POD 4 to reduce risks of temporary pacing and improve care efficiency.

Acute myocardial infarction (MI) — management of bradycardia includes COR I recommendations that in patients presenting with an acute MI, temporary pacing is indicated for medically refractory symptomatic or hemodynamically significant bradycardia related to SND or atrioventricular block; patients who present with SND or atrioventricular block in the setting of an acute MI should undergo a waiting period before determining the need for permanent pacing; and in patients presenting with an acute MI with second-degree Mobitz type II atrioventricular block, high-grade atrioventricular block, alternating bundle branch block, or third-degree atrioventricular block (persistent or infranodal), permanent pacing is indicated after a waiting period. A COR IIa recommendation states that in patients with an acute MI with symptomatic or hemodynamically significant sinus bradycardia or atrioventricular block at the level of the atrioventricular node, the administration of atropine is reasonable. COR III: Harm recommendations state that in patients with an acute MI and transient atrioventricular block that resolves, permanent pacing should not be performed, and in patients with an acute MI and a new bundle branch block or isolated fascicular block in the absence of second-degree or third-degree atrioventricular block, permanent pacing should not be performed.

Of note, Knudsen et al. demonstrated that the use of a temporary pacemaker combined with drug discontinuation in patients with drug‐related AVB was associated with a high complication rate, while the need for a permanent pacemaker was substantial, suggesting an early move to permanent pacing in such cases. The study population consisted of 55 patients with second‐degree Mobitz type II AVB or third‐degree AVB, including those with atrial fibrillation and AVB, with only patients exhibiting a prolonged pause of ≥ 5 s being included. Most of the patients were predominantly elderly and had underlying heart disease. Furthermore, most of them were on β‐blockers (49%), with the remainder on digoxin (5%), sotalol (4%), or a combination of multiple drug classes (42%). Despite drug discontinuation, 89% of the patients ultimately required permanent pacemaker implantation, with 47 having an indication during their index hospitalization and 2 following readmissions due to AVB relapse. The mean follow‐up time for patients not requiring a permanent pacemaker was 1497 ± 1538 days. Significantly, insertion of a temporary electrode resulted in complications (infection or displacement) in 11% of cases, suggesting that immediate implantation of a permanent pacemaker in patients with drug‐related AVB may be a reasonable approach when temporary pacing is required. Another noteworthy finding was that neither the degree of AVB, the QRS duration, nor any other variable was a significant predictor of permanent pacemaker implantation.

In the same line as the previous studies, Sayah et al. demonstrated that drug‐related AVB exhibits a significant rate of recurrence despite initial resolution. This study included 49 patients with symptomatic second‐ or third‐degree AVB, most of whom were elderly. The study patients were divided into two groups: those who developed AVB without receiving drugs affecting AV conduction (28 patients) and those with drug‐related AVB (21 patients). Among the patients with drug‐related AVB, most were on β‐blockers (81%), and the rest were on CCBs (9.5%), or medications from both drug classes (9.5%). The results indicated that 43% of the patients with drug‐related AVB had AVB recovery after discontinuing the offending agents. However, excluding one case lost to follow‐up, 50% of them required permanent pacemaker implantation due to AVB recurrence over a 6‐month follow‐up period.

Atrioventricular block — permanent pacing recommendations for chronic therapy/management specify that in patients with acquired second-degree Mobitz type II atrioventricular block, high-grade atrioventricular block, or third-degree atrioventricular block not attributable to reversible or physiologic causes, permanent pacing is recommended regardless of symptoms. In patients with neuromuscular diseases associated with conduction disorders, including muscular dystrophy (eg, myotonic dystrophy type 1) or Kearns-Sayre syndrome, who have evidence of second-degree atrioventricular block, third-degree atrioventricular block, or an HV interval of 70 ms or greater, regardless of symptoms, permanent pacing, with additional defibrillator capability if needed and meaningful survival of greater than 1 year is expected, is recommended. In patients with permanent AF and symptomatic bradycardia, permanent pacing is recommended. In patients who develop symptomatic atrioventricular block as a consequence of guideline-directed management and therapy for which there is no alternative treatment and continued treatment is clinically necessary, permanent pacing is recommended to increase heart rate and improve symptoms. In patients with an infiltrative cardiomyopathy, such as cardiac sarcoidosis or amyloidosis, and second-degree Mobitz type I atrioventricular block, high-grade atrioventricular block, or third-degree atrioventricular block, permanent pacing, with additional defibrillator capability if needed and meaningful survival of greater than 1 year is expected, is reasonable. In patients with lamin A/C gene mutations, including limb-girdle and Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophies, with a PR interval greater than 240 ms and LBBB, permanent pacing, with additional defibrillator capability if needed and meaningful survival of greater than 1 year is expected, is reasonable. In patients with marked first-degree or second-degree Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) atrioventricular block with symptoms that are clearly attributable to the atrioventricular block, permanent pacing is reasonable. In patients with neuromuscular diseases, such as myotonic dystrophy type 1, with a PR interval greater than 240 ms, a QRS duration greater than 120 ms, or fascicular block, permanent pacing, with additional defibrillator capability if needed and meaningful survival of greater than 1 year is expected, may be considered.

RESULTS

Patient Characteristics

The study included 836 patients with a mean age of 80.3 ± 9.1 years and a balanced sex ratio (50.6% female, n = 423). On average, patients had a low surgical risk (Society of Thoracic Surgeons score 3.4% [interquartile range, 2.3–5.2]), along with severe aortic valve stenosis characterized by a mean pressure gradient of 42.0 ± 14.4 mm Hg and an aortic valve area of 0.74 ± 0.20 cm 2. Additional clinical and procedural characteristics are shown in Table 1. Within 30 days after TAVI, 149 patients (17.8%) underwent PPMI, primarily due to third‐degree atrioventricular block (69%, n = 102). Other indications for PPMI included bradyarrhythmia (14.8%, n = 22), second‐degree atrioventricular block type Mobitz II (10.7%, n = 16), and sinus node dysfunction (3.4%, n = 5).

Comparison of Clinical and Procedural Characteristics between Patients With and Without PPMI after TAVI

Predictors for Pacemaker Implantation

The first lasso regression step revealed 14 preprocedural and 2 periprocedural predictors (see Table 2) that correlated with PPMI. When including periprocedural characteristics the model yielded an area under the curve = 0.78 in our cohort (95% CI, 0.74–0.82). In the second lasso step, where interactions between all primarily selected variables were allowed, 16 interaction terms were added. For the prediction of PPMI, the final model (see Table S1) achieved an area under the curve of 0.8 (95% CI, 0.76–0.84) with a sensitivity of 0.76 and a specificity of 0.72. We implemented the final model in an online calculator that gives individual patient and procedural risks based on our sample.

Class I (B-NR): In adults with congenital complete atrioventricular block with any symptomatic bradycardia, a wide QRS escape rhythm, mean daytime heart rate below 50 bpm, complex ventricular ectopy, or ventricular dysfunction, permanent pacing is recommended. Class I (B-NR): In adults with ACHD and postoperative second-degree Mobitz type II atrioventricular block, high-grade atrioventricular block, or third-degree atrioventricular block that is not expected to resolve, permanent pacing is recommended. Class IIa (B-NR): In asymptomatic adults with congenital complete atrioventricular block, permanent pacing is reasonable. Class IIa (C-LD): In adults with repaired ACHD who require permanent pacing for bradycardic indications, a bradycardia device with atrial antitachycardia pacing capabilities is reasonable. Class IIa (C-EO): In adults with ACHD with preexisting sinus node and/or atrioventricular conduction disease who are undergoing cardiac surgery, intraoperative placement of epicardial permanent pacing leads is reasonable. Class IIb (B-NR): In adults with ACHD and pacemakers, atrial-based permanent pacing for the prevention of atrial arrhythmias may be considered. Class III: Harm (B-NR): In selected adults with ACHD and venous to systemic intracardiac shunts, placement of endocardial pacing leads is potentially harmful.

### Contemporary practice pattern of permanent pacing for conduction disorders in inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction [^116YLdVr]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Currently, there is no clear consensus regarding the optimal waiting period before permanent pacemaker implantation in patients with conduction disorders following an inferior myocardial infarction.

Hypothesis

We aimed to elucidate the contemporary practice pattern of pacing, especially the timing of pacemaker implantation, for sinoatrial node and atrioventricular (AV) conduction disorders following an inferior ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Methods

Using the National Inpatient Sample database from 2010 to 2014, we identified patients with a primary diagnosis of inferior STEMI. Primary conduction disorders were classified into: (a) high‐degree AV block (HDAVB) consisting of complete AV block or Mobitz‐type II second‐degree AV block, (b) sinoatrial node dysfunction (SND), and (c) no major conduction disorders.

Results

Among 66 961 patients, 2706 patients (4.0%) had HDAVB, which mostly consisted of complete AV block (2594 patients). SND was observed in 393 patients (0.6%). Among the 2706 patients with HDAVB, 267 patients (9.9%) underwent permanent pacemaker. In patients with HDAVB, more than one‐third (34.9%) of permanent pacemakers were placed within 72 hours after admission. The median interval from admission to permanent pacemaker implantation was 3 days (interquartile range; 2‐5 days) for HDAVB vs 4 days (3‐6 days) for SND (P < .001). HDAVB was associated with increased in‐hospital mortality, whereas SND was not.

Conclusions

In patients who developed HDAVB following an inferior STEMI, only one in 10 patients underwent permanent pacemaker implantation. Despite its highly reversible nature, permanent pacemakers were implanted relatively early.

Of the remaining 471 eligible patients, 226 (48%) signed an informed consent form and were included. The median age at time of pacemaker implantation was 39 years (interquartile range, 32–45 years), and 54% were men (Table 1). The vast majority of participants had second‐degree Mobitz type II or more advanced AVB (93%); however, the proportion was slightly higher in nonparticipants (99%, P = 0.03). Among the participants, 2 patients had symptomatic first‐degree AVB, and 17 patients had symptomatic second‐degree Mobitz type I AVB.

Table 1
Characteristics of Young Patients With Atrioventricular Block of Unknown Cause at Time of First Pacemaker Implantation

Comorbidity was infrequent, with hypertension (5% of participants) and atrial fibrillation/flutter (4% of participants) being the most prevalent. Nonparticipants were more likely to have ischemic heart disease (3% versus 0.4%, P = 0.05), but otherwise there were no differences in characteristics between participants and nonparticipants.

Among participants, 12 (5%) had a family history of AVB before 50 years of age in a first‐degree relative; 6 (3%) had a family history of SCD before 50 years of age in a first‐degree relative, and 14 (6%) had a family history of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in a first‐degree relative.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrioventricular block — Class IIa recommendations specify that permanent pacemaker implantation is reasonable for persistent third-degree AV block with an escape rate greater than 40 bpm in asymptomatic adult patients without cardiomegaly. Permanent pacemaker implantation is reasonable for asymptomatic second-degree AV block at intra- or infra-His levels found at electrophysiological study. Permanent pacemaker implantation is reasonable for first- or second-degree AV block with symptoms similar to those of pacemaker syndrome or hemodynamic compromise. Permanent pacemaker implantation is reasonable for asymptomatic type II second-degree AV block with a narrow QRS, and when type II second-degree AV block occurs with a wide QRS, including isolated right bundle-branch block, pacing becomes a Class I recommendation.

Chronic bifascicular and fascicular block — permanent pacemaker implantation is indicated for advanced second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block or intermittent third-degree AV block; is indicated for type II second-degree AV block; and is indicated for alternating bundle-branch block. For suspected conduction disease without confirmed AV block, permanent pacemaker implantation is reasonable for syncope not demonstrated to be due to AV block when other likely causes have been excluded, specifically ventricular tachycardia (VT); is reasonable for an incidental finding at electrophysiological study of a markedly prolonged HV interval (greater than or equal to 100 milliseconds) in asymptomatic patients; and is reasonable for an incidental finding at electrophysiological study of pacing-induced infra-His block that is not physiological. In neuromuscular disease, permanent pacemaker implantation may be considered in the setting of myotonic muscular dystrophy, Erb dystrophy (limb-girdle muscular dystrophy), and peroneal muscular atrophy with bifascicular block or any fascicular block, with or without symptoms. Non-indications include that permanent pacemaker implantation is not indicated for fascicular block without AV block or symptoms and is not indicated for fascicular block with first-degree AV block without symptoms.

### His bundle pacing, learning curve, procedure characteristics, safety, and feasibility: insights from a large international observational study [^1161i6MM]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2019). Medium credibility.

2.2 Procedural details

Procedural characteristics (indication, presence of pre‐existing device, procedural success, lead/delivery equipment, lead‐generator configuration, fluoroscopy time, HBP thresholds, and programmed stimulation energy) were recorded.

Clinical indications for HBP were classified into the following five categories:
1 Intermittent/permanent high‐degree atrioventricular block (HD‐AVB, including Mobitz type II second‐degree atrioventricular block and complete heart block),
2 Before atrioventricular nodal ablation (AVNA) for management of atrial fibrillation,
3 Sinus node dysfunction (SND, including tachy‐brady syndrome),
4 Slowly conducted atrial fibrillation (AF)
5 Cardiac resynchronization therapy.

Where patients were noted to have multiple indications, only one was recorded — this was the one with the strongest pacing indication.

The pacing responses observed were recorded as selective His bundle capture, nonselective His bundle capture, and myocardial‐only capture as defined using previously described standard criteria. 4 The criteria used by the different operators whether to accept a His lead position included (a) the His capture threshold, (b) the paced QRS duration (particularly of relevance if intrinsic QRS is broad), and (c) R wave amplitude, (if the His lead is required for sensing). One center also imposed a time limit of 30 minutes.

Pulse width for HBP threshold testing was determined at the individual implanting centers.

The HBP lead delivery method was divided into three categories: the typically used approaches of the fixed curve C315 His sheath (Medtronic, MN) or the deflectable C304 delivery sheaths (Medtronic), and a third category allowing for hybrid approaches using different delivery sheaths. The type of lead implanted to deliver HBP was also recorded. Fluoroscopy time was stratified by both the number of leads implanted and the reported rhythm during implant.

2.3 Clinical outcomes

Clinical outcomes (QRS duration, HBP thresholds, and programmed stimulation energy) were collected. These outcomes were reported at implant and at the latest recorded follow‐up. HBP QRS duration was stratified by selective or nonselective capture. Nonselective capture of the His bundle results in the capture of both the local myocardium and the His bundle. The capture of the local myocardium with nonselective pacing produces a pseudo‐delta‐wave on the ECG, which prolongs the surface QRS duration. Programmed stimulation energy was analyzed as voltage and as a function of voltage and pulse width (V²t, V = voltage, t = pulse width).

### Predictors of permanent pacemaker implantation in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1114K7oj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background As transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) technology expands to healthy and lower-risk populations, the burden and predictors of procedure-related complications including the need for permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation needs to be identified. Methods and Results Digital databases were systematically searched to identify studies reporting the incidence of PPM implantation after TAVR. A random- and fixed-effects model was used to calculate unadjusted odds ratios (OR) for all predictors. A total of 78 studies, recruiting 31 261 patients were included in the final analysis. Overall, 6212 patients required a PPM, with a mean of 18.9% PPM per study and net rate ranging from 0.16% to 51%. The pooled estimates on a random-effects model indicated significantly higher odds of post-TAVR PPM implantation for men (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.04–1.28); for patients with baseline mobitz type-1 second-degree atrioventricular block (OR, 3.13; 95% CI, 1.64–5.93), left anterior hemiblock (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.09–1.86), bifascicular block (OR, 2.59; 95% CI, 1.52–4.42), right bundle-branch block (OR, 2.48; 95% CI, 2.17–2.83), and for periprocedural atriorventricular block (OR, 4.17; 95% CI, 2.69–6.46). The mechanically expandable valves had 1.44 (95% CI, 1.18–1.76), while self-expandable valves had 1.93 (95% CI, 1.42–2.63) fold higher odds of PPM requirement compared with self-expandable and balloon-expandable valves, respectively. Conclusions Male sex, baseline atrioventricular conduction delays, intraprocedural atrioventricular block, and use of mechanically expandable and self-expanding prosthesis served as positive predictors of PPM implantation in patients undergoing TAVR.

### Common questions about pacemakers [^116i2xcZ]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Pacemakers are indicated in patients with certain symptomatic bradyarrhythmias caused by sinus node dysfunction, and in those with frequent, prolonged sinus pauses. Patients with third-degree or complete atrioventricular (AV) block benefit from pacemaker placement, as do those with type II second-degree AV block because of the risk of progression to complete AV block. The use of pacemakers in patients with type I second-degree AV block is controversial. Patients with first-degree AV block generally should not receive a pacemaker except when the PR interval is significantly prolonged and the patient is symptomatic. Although some guidelines recommend pacemaker implantation for patients with hypersensitive carotid sinus syndrome, recent evidence has not shown benefit. Some older patients with severe neurocardiogenic syncope may benefit from pacemakers, but most patients with this disorder do not. Cardiac resynchronization therapy improves mortality rates and some other disease-specific measures in patients who have a QRS duration of 150 milliseconds or greater and New York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure. Patients with class II heart failure and a QRS of 150 milliseconds or greater also appear to benefit, but there is insufficient evidence to support the use of cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients with class I heart failure. Cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients with a QRS of 120 to 150 milliseconds does not reduce rates of hospitalization or death.

Conclusion

We consider that in young patients (such as the one presented here), HBP is an alternative worth considering. However, the limitations of permanent His-bundle pacing are the inability to implant the lead on the His-bundle in 10–20% of the patients and the lack of available randomized large-scale data to justify the use of His-bundle pacing in all cases.

ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 — permanent pacing for atrioventricular (AV) block, Class I (COR I): Permanent pacing is recommended in patients with acquired second-degree Mobitz type II AV block, high-grade AV block, or third-degree AV block not attributable to reversible or physiologic causes, regardless of symptoms (LOE B-NR). Permanent pacing is recommended in neuromuscular diseases with conduction disorders (including myotonic dystrophy type 1 or Kearns-Sayre syndrome) with second- or third-degree AV block or an HV interval of 70 ms or greater, regardless of symptoms, with additional defibrillator capability if needed when meaningful survival of greater than 1 year is expected (LOE B-NR). Permanent pacing is recommended in permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) with symptomatic bradycardia (LOE C-LD). Permanent pacing is recommended when symptomatic AV block is a consequence of guideline-directed therapy with no alternative and continued treatment is clinically necessary to increase heart rate and improve symptoms (LOE C-LD).

Methods

This study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board and no informed consent was required. The authors have full access to all the data in the study and take responsibility for its integrity and the data analysis. The data that support the findings are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. Consecutive patients who underwent TAVR at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota between February 2012 and June 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with prior aortic valve replacement, PPM or implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator, intraprocedural death, or conversion to surgical replacement were excluded. Before TAVR, all patients were evaluated by the heart team with baseline ECG and echocardiogram. TAVR procedures were performed as previously described. 6, 7 The majority of patients had temporary balloon‐tipped right ventricular pacemaker placed for rapid ventricular pacing that was removed before patients left the catheterization laboratory/hybrid operating room. Selected patients presumed to be at high risk for atrioventricular block (AVB) in the postprocedural period may have undergone active fixation temporary (screw‐in) pacemaker placement that was typically left in place for 24 to 48 hours at the discretion of the operator. Continuous telemetry monitoring was performed intraprocedurally and continued for at least 24 hours in all patients. In addition, 12‐lead ECG was performed immediately post‐TAVR and daily thereafter until hospital discharge.

In the absence of national guidelines, an institutional clinical practice protocol to guide the decision of PPM was developed through multidisciplinary collaboration, which has evolved throughout the institutional experience. Potential indications for PPM included the following: (1) HAVB; (2) Mobitz type II second‐degree AVB; (3) sinus node dysfunction (sinus bradycardia < 40/min or sinus pause > 3 seconds while awake); or (4) prophylactic placement for new left bundle‐branch block (LBBB) or select patients with baseline right bundle‐branch block (RBBB) (recommended in 2015–2017). Select patients who did not have PPM placed before hospital discharge received a remote 30‐day continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring (AEM) system (BodyGuardian; Preventice Technologies, Inc; Eagan, MN) to assess for late HAVB. 4 Since 2017, 30‐day AEM has been recommended for all patients with baseline RBBB or new LBBB post‐TAVR who were dismissed without PPM. All patients were encouraged to undergo in‐person follow‐up at 30 days.

Bradycardia management for adult congenital heart disease — recommendations specify that in adults with adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) and symptomatic sinus node dysfunction (SND) or chronotropic incompetence, atrial based permanent pacing is recommended; in adults with ACHD and symptomatic bradycardia related to atrioventricular block, permanent pacing is recommended; in adults with congenital complete atrioventricular block with any symptomatic bradycardia, a wide QRS escape rhythm, mean daytime heart rate below 50 bpm, complex ventricular ectopy, or ventricular dysfunction, permanent pacing is recommended; and in adults with ACHD and postoperative second-degree Mobitz type II atrioventricular block, high-grade atrioventricular block, or third-degree atrioventricular block that is not expected to resolve, permanent pacing is recommended. In asymptomatic adults with congenital complete atrioventricular block, permanent pacing is reasonable, and in adults with repaired ACHD who require permanent pacing for bradycardic indications, a bradycardia device with atrial antitachycardia pacing capabilities is reasonable; in adults with ACHD with preexisting sinus node and/or atrioventricular conduction disease who are undergoing cardiac surgery, intraoperative placement of epicardial permanent pacing leads is reasonable. In adults with ACHD and pacemakers, atrial-based permanent pacing for the prevention of atrial arrhythmias may be considered. In selected adults with ACHD and venous to systemic intracardiac shunts, placement of endocardial pacing leads is potentially harmful.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Acquired atrioventricular (AV) block in adults — definitions and thresholds are outlined as follows: AV block is classified as first-, second-, or third-degree (complete) block. First-degree AV block is defined as abnormal prolongation of the PR interval (greater than 0.20 seconds). When AV conduction occurs in a 2:1 pattern, block cannot be classified unequivocally as type I or type II. Advanced second-degree AV block refers to the blocking of 2 or more consecutive P waves with some conducted beats; in atrial fibrillation, a prolonged pause (e.g., greater than 5 seconds) should be considered due to advanced second-degree AV block. Third-degree AV block (complete heart block) is defined as absence of AV conduction. Nonrandomized studies strongly suggest that permanent pacing improves survival in patients with third-degree AV block, especially if syncope has occurred.

Surgical myectomy and alcohol septal ablation for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy — In patients with second-degree Mobitz type II atrioventricular block, high-grade atrioventricular block, or persistent complete atrioventricular block after alcohol septal ablation or surgical myectomy, permanent pacing is recommended before discharge. In selected patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who require permanent pacing for rate support after alcohol septal ablation or surgical myectomy and are at high risk for sudden cardiac death and a meaningful survival of greater than 1 year is expected, selecting a device with defibrillator capabilities is reasonable. In patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who undergo alcohol septal ablation and who are at risk for developing late atrioventricular block, prolonged ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring may be considered. In patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, evaluation of ventricular conduction by electrophysiology study (EPS) at the time of alcohol septal ablation may be considered for identifying future risk of atrioventricular block.

### Permanent pacemaker reduction using temporary-permanent pacemaker as a 1-month bridge after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a prospective, multicentre, single-arm, observational study [^114H5UqV]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and patients

This prospective multi-centre single-arm study was conducted in 13 tertiary hospitals in China (ChiCTR2200057931). Patients who underwent TAVR between March 1, 2022 and March 1, 2023 were evaluated using 24-h continuous electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring and post-procedural 12-lead ECG. The decision to use TPPM was based on the following selection criteria. Patients who developed high-degree atrioventricular block (HAVB) or complete heart block (CHB) (a minimum of 30 min duration of the HAVB/CHB episode) during the TAVR procedure or within 1 month after TAVR were included. HAVB was defined as any of the following: second-degree atrioventricular block (AVB) type 2 (Mobitz II); 2:1 AVB in the presence of a QRS duration of ≥ 120 ms; or two or more consecutive P-waves at a constant physiologic rate that do not conduct to the ventricles. CHB was defined as P-waves at a constant rate with a dissociated ventricular rhythm (no association between P- and R-waves) or fixed slow ventricular rhythm in the presence of atrial fibrillation. Patients with first-degree AVB (PR interval ≥ 240 ms and ≥ 20 ms larger than baseline) plus new onset left bundle branch block (LBBB) (QRS duration ≥ 150 ms) were also included in this study since these patients were generally considered to be at a higher risk of delayed HAVB/CHB and PPM was always implanted before discharge. We excluded patients with pre-existing PPM implantation or indications for PPM implantation before the TAVR procedure. The study was approved by the medical ethics committees in each participating hospital, and the patients provided written informed consent for participation. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guidelines.

Recommendation-specific supportive guidance — symptom correlation, monitoring, and site of block: In patients who have second-degree Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) or 2:1 atrioventricular block but with symptoms that do not temporally correspond to the episode of atrioventricular block, it is unclear whether permanent pacing will improve symptoms or alleviate them, and if the symptoms do not correlate with the episodes of first-degree or second-degree Mobitz type I atrioventricular block, a pacemaker would not be indicated; given the procedural and long-term risks of PPMs, for such patients further monitoring and follow up should be implemented. First- and second-degree Mobitz type I atrioventricular blocks (or 2:1 atrioventricular block, if the level of block is at the atrioventricular node) are typically benign, treatment with a pacemaker are typically reserved for significant symptoms that affect QOL, and occasionally second-degree Mobitz type I atrioventricular block is infranodal, in which instances a pacemaker may be considered even in the absence of symptoms; ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring or a treadmill exercise test may be useful, improvement in atrioventricular conduction suggests the site of block is at the atrioventricular node whereas worsening suggests infranodal block, and if symptoms do not clearly correspond the overall risk-benefit ratio is unfavorable; in patients with long-standing persistent or permanent AF who have a near and appropriate chronotropic response, in the absence of symptoms, pacing for rate support is unlikely to be beneficial, and although PPM implantation is relatively low risk, procedural complications and death can occur and implanted leads have long-term management implications.

ACC/AHA/HRS — Acquired atrioventricular (AV) block in adults, Class I indications: Permanent pacemaker implantation is indicated for third-degree and advanced second-degree AV block at any anatomic level associated with bradycardia with symptoms (including heart failure) or ventricular arrhythmias presumed to be due to AV block, and is indicated when arrhythmias and other medical conditions require drug therapy that results in symptomatic bradycardia. It is indicated in awake, symptom-free patients in sinus rhythm with documented periods of asystole greater than or equal to 3.0 seconds or any escape rate less than 40 bpm, or with an escape rhythm that is below the AV node, and in awake, symptom-free patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and bradycardia with 1 or more pauses of at least 5 seconds or longer. It is indicated after catheter ablation of the AV junction and for postoperative AV block that is not expected to resolve after cardiac surgery. It is indicated in association with neuromuscular diseases with AV block (e.g., myotonic muscular dystrophy, Kearns-Sayre syndrome, Erb dystrophy [limb-girdle muscular dystrophy], and peroneal muscular atrophy), with or without symptoms, and for second-degree AV block with associated symptomatic bradycardia regardless of type or site of block. It is indicated for asymptomatic persistent third-degree AV block with average awake ventricular rates of 40 bpm or faster if cardiomegaly or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is present or if the site of block is below the AV node, and it is indicated for second- or third-degree AV block during exercise in the absence of myocardial ischemia.

Dual-chamber device appropriateness with pacing-related scenarios is summarized as follows: implantation of a dual-chamber device was considered Appropriate for patients with standard pacing indications, including symptomatic sick sinus syndrome with chronotropic incompetence or marked sinus bradycardia from required drug therapy and third-degree atrioventricular block or advanced second-degree atrioventricular block (Mobitz type II AV block or high-degree AV block); implantation was also considered Appropriate in scenarios not necessarily meeting standard pacemaker guidelines, such as asymptomatic sinus bradycardia. Additionally, history of paroxysmal atrial arrhythmias or slow ventricular arrhythmias where "slow VT" overlaps with the sinus tachycardia rate is now considered May Be Appropriate.

### Long-term follow-up of second-degree heart block in children [^117B32mM]. Pediatric Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Little is known about the outcomes of children with second-degree heart block. We aimed to determine whether children with structurally normal hearts and Mobitz 1, 2:1 block or Mobitz 2 are at increased risk for progressing to complete heart block (CHB) or requiring a pacemaker (PM) at long-term follow-up. We searched our institutional electrophysiology database for children with potentially concerning second-degree block on ambulatory rhythm monitoring between 2009 and 2021, defined as frequent episodes of Mobitz 1 or 2:1 block, episodes of Mobitz 1 or 2:1 block with additional evidence of conduction disease (i.e. first-degree heart block, bundle branch block), or episodes of Mobitz 2. Ambulatory rhythm monitor, ECG, and demographic data were reviewed. The primary composite outcome was CHB on follow-up rhythm monitor or PM placement. 20 patients were in the final analysis. Six (30%) patients either developed CHB but do not have a PM (4 = 20%) or have a PM (2 = 10%). Median follow-up was 5.8 years (IQR 4.4–7.0). Patients with CHB or PM were more likely to have second-degree block at maximum sinus rate (67% vs. 0%, p = 0.003), a below normal average heart rate (67% vs. 14%, p = 0.04), and 2:1 block on initial ECG (50% vs. 0%, p = 0.02). In this study of children with potentially concerning second-degree block, 30% of patients progressed to CHB or required a PM. Second-degree block at maximum sinus rate, a low average heart, and 2:1 block on initial ECG were associated with increased risk of disease progression.
