## Question

Asthma etiology

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about asthma etiology. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching framework that asthma is heterogeneous and arises from gene–environment interactions. Then, I should verify the genetic architecture and its limitations. Next, I will examine environmental contributors, including modifiable and non-modifiable factors, and their population-attributable fractions. After that, I need to consider developmental timing and the role of early-life exposures. I will then integrate mechanistic pathways, including type 2 and non–type 2 inflammation, the epithelium, and remodeling. Finally, I should translate this into clinical implications for phenotypes/endotypes, prevention, and precision medicine, while noting uncertainties and research gaps.

> Let me first confirm the foundational framework: asthma is not a single disease but a heterogeneous syndrome unified by variable airflow limitation and symptoms, with etiology driven by complex gene–environment interactions across the life course. I should double-check that this is consistently reflected in high-credibility sources, and yes, the Lancet and GINA both emphasize heterogeneity and gene–environment interplay as central to asthma causation [^1d7a819d] [^bb0b9757].

> I will now examine the genetic architecture. Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous loci, but each confers modest risk and collectively explain only a fraction of heritability, indicating polygenic susceptibility and context dependence. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and functional localization — most asthma-associated variants reside in non-coding regulatory regions, complicating mechanistic translation, and polygenic risk scores are emerging but not yet definitive for prediction. This aligns with contemporary reviews and large-scale genetic studies [^e406c620] [^197cbcc6] [^aaf83d5b].

> Next, I should review environmental contributors and their population impact. High-credibility analyses indicate that four modifiable factors account for nearly 30% of the global asthma DALY burden: high BMI, occupational exposures, traffic-related air pollution (NO2 as a proxy), and smoking. Hold on, I should verify the directionality — these are risk factors for incident asthma, not just triggers, and they offer actionable prevention targets at individual and policy levels [^aaf83d5b].

> Let me consider additional environmental and social determinants. Early-life exposures such as prenatal and postnatal tobacco smoke, allergen sensitization, respiratory infections, and social deprivation are repeatedly linked to asthma inception. I need to ensure I separate association from causation — while some links are observational, converging evidence and mechanistic plausibility strengthen inference, and housing quality and neighborhood pollution disproportionately affect low-income communities, reinforcing health-equity dimensions in etiology [^de24c80a] [^d396830e] [^9d76004a].

> I should confirm the role of developmental timing. Most patients with asthma, regardless of age of onset, show evidence of early-life airway vulnerability, and early childhood represents a critical window where gene–environment interactions shape trajectories. Let me verify whether a pre-asthmatic state has been characterized — yes, recent work describes aberrant epithelial differentiation patterns and early immune programming that precede overt disease, supporting the concept that inception often occurs in the first years of life [^5facbb5d] [^3556c6d5].

> Now, I will integrate mechanistic pathways. Type 2–high asthma, driven by IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, features eosinophilia and IgE, and is the best-characterized endotype with validated biologic targets. But wait, I should not overgeneralize — non–type 2 pathways, including neutrophilic and paucigranulocytic phenotypes, involve innate immunity, the airway epithelium, and structural remodeling, and these mechanisms are less well understood yet clinically important, especially in severe disease [^b031e323] [^8ecb2f5f] [^e612c883].

> Let me consider the epithelium and remodeling more carefully. The airway epithelium is both a sensor and effector, and "remembered" responses to environmental insults can perpetuate dysfunction. Airway remodeling, including thickening of the reticular basement membrane, goblet cell hyperplasia, and smooth muscle hypertrophy, contributes to persistent airflow limitation and may be only partially reversible. I should double-check that remodeling is accepted as clinically relevant — yes, expert statements endorse its pathobiologic significance while acknowledging measurement and therapeutic challenges [^e612c883] [^fe1893dd].

> I need to ensure I address the hygiene hypothesis accurately. Early formulations posited that reduced microbial exposure increases atopy and asthma, but emerging data complicate this picture; some microbial exposures are protective, whereas specific respiratory viruses in early life increase asthma risk, and the microbiome's role is nuanced and context dependent. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — current thinking favors a balanced microbiome and targeted microbe-based strategies rather than blanket hygiene reversal [^88ad5492] [^7c9c2ead] [^c3fe20a9].

> Next, I should review clinical translation into phenotypes and endotypes. Phenotypes cluster observable features (age of onset, atopy, eosinophilia), while endotypes reflect distinct biologic mechanisms; precision medicine leverages this to match patients to targeted therapies, particularly in severe asthma. I should confirm that guidelines endorse a stepwise, phenotype-informed approach — GINA and contemporary reviews support stratified care and the use of biomarkers to guide biologic selection, though biomarker panels remain limited outside type 2 axes [^bb0b9757] [^b031e323] [^82689d02].

> I will now examine prevention implications. Given the substantial population-attributable fractions for modifiable risks, public health strategies targeting obesity, clean air, occupational safety, and tobacco control are justified. But wait, what about primary prevention in early life? Trials of RSV immunoprophylaxis, maternal vaccination, and early-life microbiome modulation are ongoing, and no intervention has yet proven to prevent asthma definitively, so counseling should be cautious and evidence-aligned [^aaf83d5b] [^5e91f6a6] [^3556c6d5].

> Let me reconsider uncertainties and research gaps so I don't overstate certainty. Causality remains challenging to establish for several associations, biomarkers beyond FeNO and blood eosinophils are not yet validated for routine endotyping, and the relative contributions of different mechanisms vary by age, sex, and ancestry. I should confirm that guidelines call for more research into mild asthma phenotypes, progression, and treatable traits — yes, ATS and GINA highlight these gaps and advocate for multidimensional, longitudinal studies [^6ad2b113] [^f03c98ad] [^e612c883].

> In summary, asthma etiology reflects a dynamic interplay between polygenic susceptibility and environmental exposures acting at sensitive developmental windows, producing heterogeneous endotypes with distinct inflammatory and structural signatures. Clinically, this mandates moving beyond a one-size-fits-all model toward precision assessment of phenotypes, biomarkers, and targeted therapies, while simultaneously investing in population-level prevention of modifiable risks and equity-focused interventions to reduce disparities in asthma inception and outcomes [^1d7a819d] [^aaf83d5b] [^bb0b9757].

Asthma etiology is **multifactorial** [^1d7a819d], arising from the interplay of genetic susceptibility and environmental exposures [^aaf83d5b], with early-life events shaping disease inception and persistence [^5facbb5d]. Key genetic drivers include **polygenic variants** (e.g. IL33, IL1RL1, GSDMB) [^e406c620] and family history [^ef21ba40], while major environmental risks include early-life viral infections (especially RSV and rhinovirus) [^7c9c2ead], allergen sensitization [^b2dcc035], tobacco smoke [^9d76004a], air pollution [^aaf83d5b], and occupational exposures [^002493e9]. Early-life immune programming, the microbiome [^88ad5492], and epigenetic modifications [^357f44e2] modulate risk, and **no single cause** explains all asthma; instead, cumulative effects of multiple factors drive heterogeneous phenotypes and endotypes [^0a473490] [^b031e323].

---

## Genetic factors

- **Polygenic susceptibility**: Multiple genetic variants contribute to asthma risk, including IL33, IL1RL1, GSDMB, and ORMDL3 [^e406c620] [^aa750025].
- **Family history**: Having a parent or sibling with asthma significantly increases risk, reflecting shared genes and environments [^ef21ba40].
- **Gene-environment interactions**: Genetic susceptibility interacts with environmental exposures (e.g. allergens, smoke) to trigger disease [^197cbcc6] [^8cef748c].

---

## Environmental factors

- **Early-life infections**: Respiratory viruses (RSV, human rhinovirus) in infancy are strongly linked to asthma inception and persistence [^7c9c2ead] [^3556c6d5].
- **Allergen sensitization**: Early sensitization to aeroallergens (dust mites, pets, cockroach, mold) is a major risk, especially in children [^b2dcc035] [^de24c80a].
- **Tobacco smoke**: Prenatal and postnatal exposure increase asthma risk and severity [^9d76004a] [^500ea23b].
- **Air pollution**: Traffic-related pollutants (NO2, PM2.5) and ozone are associated with incident asthma [^aaf83d5b] [^476ea1f7].
- **Occupational exposures**: Chemicals, dusts, and fumes in the workplace cause occupational asthma [^002493e9].

---

## Early-life immune programming

Early-life immune programming shapes asthma risk through **microbiome** influences, wherein dysbiosis of gut and airway microbiota alters immune development and increases asthma susceptibility [^88ad5492] [^357f44e2]. Epigenetic modifications — DNA methylation and histone changes — mediate environmental effects on gene expression and immune function [^357f44e2] [^d0d2af9b]. The **hygiene hypothesis** posits that reduced early microbial exposure may bias the immune system toward atopy, though evidence is mixed and context dependent [^88ad5492] [^3a1853cc].

---

## Heterogeneity of asthma

Asthma is **heterogeneous**, with distinct phenotypes (clinical clusters) and endotypes (biologic mechanisms) [^0a473490] [^b031e323]. Type 2–high asthma features eosinophilia and IgE, whereas non–type 2 asthma involves neutrophils or paucigranulocytic inflammation [^b031e323] [^1b89d600]. This heterogeneity explains variability in triggers, severity, and treatment response [^1d7a819d] [^76691807].

Asthma etiology is **multifactorial**, with genetic susceptibility interacting with environmental exposures and early-life immune programming to produce heterogeneous disease. No single cause explains all asthma; instead, cumulative effects of multiple factors drive its inception and persistence [^1d7a819d] [^aaf83d5b].

### Asthma exacerbations. 2: aetiology [^d71cfb85]. Thorax (2006). Low credibility.

The natural history of asthma involves relatively stable periods that are often punctuated by significant exacerbations of symptoms. There are many aetiologies that may lead to an increase in asthma severity including respiratory infection (bacterial/viral), allergens, irritants, and occupational exposures. Each trigger probably acts through different mechanisms, but a final common pathway of multicellular inflammation, enhanced bronchial responsiveness, and airflow obstruction is a likely consequence. This review discusses the most common causes of asthma exacerbations with a focus on their microbiology and immunopathogenesis. Through an understanding of underlying causes of asthma exacerbations, treatments with increased effectiveness may be developed, and it is these future developments that may directly influence the morbidity and mortality of the disease.

### The natural history of asthma and early intervention [^2cd334ba]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

The understanding of the natural history of asthma has changed significantly during the last 4 decades, with the view that asthma is a disease of chronic inflammation and varying degrees of severity replacing that of it being a disease of reversible airway obstruction. Treatment has progressed in accordance with the growing knowledge about the pathophysiologic mechanisms of asthma. Nevertheless, much remains unknown, especially about how to treat asthma effectively. Pharmacogenetics, an emerging field in which the knowledge of the genetic basis of a disease is applied to its treatment, may ultimately lead investigators to define many unanswered questions about asthma therapy. Asthma occurs early in childhood, but the ideal time for intervention and the most effective treatment strategy are yet unknown for young patients. The lack of response to a therapy may indicate the course of the disease as much as a lack of treatment efficacy. It may be that including such variables as airway hyperresponsiveness in treatment goals will not only become routine but will result in improved long-term asthma treatment as well. The progress in defining asthma and targeting treatment toward specific pathophysiologic mechanisms should lead to better-defined optimal strategies for treating asthma in children.

### What have mechanistic studies taught Us about childhood asthma? [^d0d2af9b]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Childhood asthma is a chronic heterogeneous syndrome consisting of different disease entities or phenotypes. The immunologic and cellular processes that occur during asthma development are still not fully understood but represent distinct endotypes. Mechanistic studies have examined the role of gene expression, protein levels, and cell types in early life development and the manifestation of asthma, many under the influence of environmental stimuli, which can be both protective and risk factors for asthma. Genetic variants can regulate gene expression, controlled partly by different epigenetic mechanisms. In addition, environmental factors, such as living space, nutrition, and smoking, can contribute to these mechanisms. All of these factors produce modifications in gene expression that can alter the development and function of immune and epithelial cells and subsequently different trajectories of childhood asthma. These early changes in a partially immature immune system can have dramatic effects (e.g., causing dysregulation), which in turn contribute to different disease endotypes and may help to explain differential responsiveness to asthma treatment. In this review, we summarize published studies that have aimed to uncover distinct mechanisms in childhood asthma, considering genetics, epigenetics, and environment. Moreover, a discussion of new, powerful tools for single-cell immunologic assays for phenotypic and functional analysis is included, which promise new mechanistic insights into childhood asthma development and therapeutic and preventive strategies.

### Genetic risks and childhood-onset asthma [^aa750025]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Recent large-scale genome-wide association studies have successfully identified several genetic loci that influence asthma susceptibility. The loci thus far identified confer a high population attributable risk for childhood-onset disease and have provided a better understanding of the primary mechanisms underlying asthma and a clear focus for new therapies to treat the disease. The loci are of limited utility for diagnostic or predictive genetic testing. This review considers different aspects of genetic risk, including individual, population, and familial risks, and explores how these different measures interact and how the next generation of genetic studies might be best designed.

### What is severe asthma? [^f6450d65]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2012). Low credibility.

Asthma is common, and some individuals are severely affected by it. Learned institutions have sought to provide a definition of 'severe asthma' to facilitate research and clinical care. This is a challenging undertaking given the difficulty in defining asthma and the lack of supportive evidence for a distinct severe asthma phenotype. In this review, we discuss the rationale for a definition of severe asthma and the relative merits of the sequential attempts that have been made to produce such a definition. The difficulty in disentangling control and severity is highlighted, as is the heterogeneity of phenotype in severe asthma, and potential for misclassification. We conclude that the search for a singular definition of severe asthma is problematic, though likely to continue. We suggest the alternative strategy of using classifiers with a specific aim related to symptoms, pathophysiology or service provision.

### Asthma: 2015 and beyond [^bfdaca97]. Respiratory Care (2011). Low credibility.

Asthma is a multifactorial, chronic inflammatory disease of the airways. The knowledge that asthma is an inflammatory disorder has become a core fundamental in the definition of asthma. Asthma's chief features include a variable degree of air-flow obstruction and bronchial hyper-responsiveness, in addition to the underlying chronic airways inflammation. This underlying chronic airway inflammation substantially contributes to airway hyper-responsiveness, air-flow limitation, respiratory symptoms, and disease chronicity. However, this underlying chronic airway inflammation has implications for the diagnosis, management, and potential prevention of the disease. This review for the respiratory therapy community summarizes these developments as well as providing an update on asthma epidemiology, natural history, cause, and pathogenesis. This paper also provides an overview on appropriate diagnostic and monitoring strategies for asthma, pharmacology, and newer therapies for the future as well as relevant management of acute and ambulatory asthma, and a brief review of educational approaches.

### Genetic and environmental risk factors for asthma: towards prevention [^aaf83d5b]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Asthma is a common chronic airway disease affecting an estimated 260 million individuals of all ages worldwide, contributing to substantial morbidity, mortality, and economic burden. Asthma is heterogeneous in age at onset (childhood vs adult onset), clinical presentation, type of underlying airway inflammation (type 2 high vs type 2 low), prognosis, and treatment response. Asthma is caused by multiple genetic and environmental factors, and possibly their interaction, across the life course. Genetic studies have provided important insights into the pathogenesis, biology, and immunology of asthma, fostering drug discovery. The role of polygenic risk scores in aiding asthma diagnostics and delineating individuals at high risk of asthma development is becoming more evident. Four modifiable environmental, social, and lifestyle risk factors for asthma are responsible for nearly 30% of the global disability-adjusted life-years asthma burden: high BMI, occupational exposures, NO 2 (as a proxy for traffic-related air pollution), and smoking. These modifiable risk factors offer substantial opportunities for primary prevention of asthma, at the individual and societal level. National, regional, and global strategies aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals are urgently needed to attenuate the predicted increase in asthma cases by 2050.

### Asthma inception: epidemiologic risk factors and natural history across the life course [^5e91f6a6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Given the wealth of information on asthma risk factors, why have we not made progress in primary asthma prevention? Some risk factors associated with asthma inception are probably best tackled at a public health or population level, such as obesity prevention, pollution, violence, and physical activity, as they are likely to have many positive health benefits. Targeted immunologic therapies that may modify the immature and developing immune system, airway, and microbiome would need to be approved for infants or young children to intervene before early-childhood asthma development, and new biologic therapies are often not studied or approved in very young children. Last, not all risk and protective factors identified in observational studies may be causal in asthma development. Given the strong environmental contribution to asthma development, and the significant societal and individual burden, primary prevention strategies at the population and individual level should be a priority.

### Genetic studies of the etiology of asthma [^32deb62f]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2011). Low credibility.

Asthma is a heterogeneous disease for which a strong genetic basis is firmly established. Although the generally accepted definition includes three domains of symptoms (variable airway obstruction, airway hyper-responsiveness, and airway inflammation), there is general agreement that, rather than being a single disease entity, asthma consists of related, overlapping syndromes. A considerable proportion of asthma is IgE-mediated, but the observation that not all individuals with asthma are atopic adds to the heterogeneity. Although a genetic basis for asthma is undeniable, elucidation of polymorphisms that are "causal" is greatly hampered by variability in the clinical phenotype, which is likely due to the multiple molecular mechanisms underlying the complex pathological processes involved in disease development and progression. One objective of this review is to consider progress that has been made to date in gene discovery in the field of asthma, with a focus on the evolution of molecular genetic methods that have led to the discoveries thus far, and with a particular focus on the major advances owed to the published genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on asthma to date. A second objective is to consider a Darwinian approach toward understanding the genetic underpinnings of asthma, including evidence supporting a modified Hygiene Hypothesis, which suggests that there are co-associations between asthma risk polymorphisms and polymorphisms associated with another IgE-mediated disease, schistosomiasis. The overall conclusion is that the huge research efforts and expense committed to asthma genetics have changed the perception about disease etiology in general and the functional relevance of the asthma genes identified thus far in particular.

### Asthma inception: epidemiologic risk factors and natural history across the life course [^de24c80a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

"Asthma" is a descriptive label for a lower airway disease manifesting with symptoms including breathlessness, cough, difficulty in breathing, and wheezing, which is characterized by combinations of acute attacks and interval symptoms. Asthma is characterized by any or all of varying types of airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, mucus hypersecretion, and an abnormal airway response to pathogens, all leading to variable airflow obstruction. Asthma is an umbrella term, and it is likely that different pathophysiological mechanisms lead to the clinical presentation and diagnosis. When feasible, age-appropriate lung function tests should be used to demonstrate variable airflow obstruction (and confirm asthma diagnosis from age 5 yr), and biomarkers and other investigations should be done to define clinical (phenotype) and biological (endotype) disease characteristics (i.e. the type of asthma). Heredity remains a very important risk factor for disease development, in addition to early-life (i.e. from conception to first 3 yr of life postnatally) conditions, such as recurrent airway infections, wheezing, and multiple aeroallergen IgE sensitization. Several lifestyle and environmental risk factors for asthma have been identified, including maternal/parental tobacco smoke exposure, air pollution, allergens, social deprivation, and, more recently, additional risk factors including chemical pollutants (e.g. phenols, phthalates) and extreme weather events related to climate change.

The asthmas are truly complex diseases, and, like many chronic diseases, there is no single determinant or causal factor. Despite major progress in experimental and clinical research, there are still many knowledge gaps in asthma inception and progression across the life course. What is the childhood asthma prevalence as of today, and when does asthma commence? Is there an early-life disease state before the onset of airway inflammation? What are the key drivers from childhood wheezing to asthma? Can we identify reliable biomarkers that enable distinction of different asthma phenotypes (beyond fractional exhaled nitric oxide [FeNO] and blood eosinophils)? What is the long-term prognosis given the patient's type of asthma, and can we prevent asthma from becoming severe? In this review, we address some of these issues, with a focus on asthma inception and progression across the life course, from mechanisms to epidemiology and clinical applications. We have not covered asthma remission, which will be the subject of another review.

### Etiology of asthma exacerbations [^81b21623]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Asthma exacerbations are common, and the major morbidity, mortality, and health care costs associated with asthma are related to exacerbations. The majority are related to viral infection, and although progress has been made in identifying the mechanisms of virus-induced asthma exacerbations, there is still much to be learned. Allergen exposure causes some exacerbations and can participate in virus-induced exacerbations, as can other environmental exposures. A role for atypical bacterial infection in exacerbations is also increasingly recognized. Exacerbations are characterized by airway inflammation, which can differ in type depending on whether it is primarily infective or allergic in origin. An increased understanding of the inflammatory pathways might lead to identification of targets for the development of novel prevention or treatment strategies.

### Asthma: factors underlying inception, exacerbation, and disease progression [^21efd0a5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Asthma is a heterogeneous disorder that is characterized by variable airflow obstruction, airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness, and reversibility either spontaneously or as a result of treatment. Multiple causes no doubt exist for both its inception and symptom exacerbation once the disease is established. Factors underlying inception can range from viral respiratory tract infections in infancy to occupational exposures in adults. Factors underlying asthma exacerbations include allergen exposure in sensitized individuals, viral infections, exercise, irritants, and ingestion of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents among others. Exacerbating factors might include one or all of these exposures and vary both among and within patients. Asthma treatment is determined to a large extent after an assessment of severity, which can be variable over time and assessed in 2 domains: impairment (current) and risk (long-term consequences). Unfortunately, despite the availability of effective therapies, suboptimal asthma control exists in many patients on a worldwide basis. The future development of novel therapies and treatment paradigms should address these disparities.

### Unraveling the heterogeneity of asthma: decoding subtypes of asthma [^0a473490]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a heterogeneous disease with diverse underlying mechanisms contributing to disease susceptibility and progression. Asthma endotypes and phenotypes have emerged as critical frameworks to help understand the variation in disease presentation and response to therapies. Phenotypes are the observable characteristics or traits of an organism that are produced by the interaction of genotype and environment. Asthma endotypes are distinct subsets of asthma that are characterized by specific biologic pathways, including differences in inflammatory pathways, genetic predisposition, and immune response. Identifying asthma endotypes and the associated clinical phenotypes is pivotal for the development of personalized treatment strategies, as it enables clinicians to select more effective therapies based on specific biologic mechanisms. This review explores asthma endotypes and their associated phenotypes and the ongoing effort to refine diagnostic tools and therapeutic personalized approaches, aiming to improve outcomes for patients with asthma.

### Teen newsletter: asthma… [^9d76004a]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

An asthma attack happens in the airways that carry air to your lungs. During an asthma attack, the sides of the airways in your lungs swell and the airways shrink. Less air gets in and out of your lungs, and mucous that your body makes clogs up the airways, making it harder and harder to breathe. An asthma attack can happen when you are exposed to "asthma triggers __. __" The most common triggers are tobacco smoke, dust mites, outdoor air pollution, cockroach allergen, pets, mold, smoke from burning wood or grass, and infections like flu. Genetic, environmental, and occupational factors have been linked to a person developing asthma. If someone in your immediate family has asthma, you are more likely to have it. Risk Factor Identification. After we've identified the problem, the next question is, "What is the cause of the problem.

" For example, are there factors that might make certain populations more susceptible to diseases, such as something in the environment or certain behaviors that people are practicing. Socioeconomic and demographic factors as well as health care use might influence health patterns in urban and rural areas related to asthma. Risk factors for developing asthma include poverty status, the education level of parents, location, smoking or being in the presence of smokers, and access to medical care/coverage. Pre- and post-natal exposures to cigarette smoking are associated with asthma and asthma morbidity in childhood. In utero smoke exposure also varies by insurance type and education status. During childhood, the prevalence of tobacco smoke exposure is higher in children with asthma symptoms and doctor-diagnosed asthma, with a larger difference in children from lower socio-economic status. Smoke exposure increases asthma morbidity.

Smoke-free laws have been associated with fewer asthma ER visits both in children and in adults. Outdoor pollutants can trigger asthma exacerbations and may play a role in developing asthma. Non-whites are more likely to live in areas with elevated levels of air pollutants, including particulates, carbon monoxide, ozone and sulfur dioxide. A study in New York City showed higher rates of asthma exacerbations and hospitalizations in children from highly polluted areas such as the Bronx, which also has a high percentage of residents from minority populations.
- Fear about routine use of medications
- Not avoiding common asthma triggers, such as pet dander
- lacking awareness on asthma management, causing the family and parents to experience significant stress for managing the child's asthma.

### Rethinking genetic models of asthma: the role of environmental modifiers [^8cef748c]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Asthma is a common, chronic disease with a complex etiology. To date, more than 35 genes have been associated with asthma or related phenotypes in multiple populations, but none of them has been shown to contribute to risk in all populations studied. We suggest that genetic susceptibility is both context dependent and developmentally regulated, and that ignoring the environmental context will miss many important associations and clues to pathogenesis. We define 'environment' broadly to include the in utero environment, maternal affection status and sex, and propose that epigenetic mechanisms are the link between our genes and our environment.

### Asthma 2005–2006: bench to bedside [^ed70837c]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Asthma is a prevalent and complex syndrome with several phenotypic variants. The central features are bronchial inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness. Many aspects of asthma, such as control of airway hyperresponsiveness, causative factors, and variable responses to treatment, remain poorly understood. This review highlights some of the latest insights into the pathogenesis of asthma that might ultimately bear on the development or choice of treatment modalities.

### Asthma epidemiology, pathophysiology, and initial evaluation [^2ebed736]. Pediatrics in Review (2009). Low credibility.

The prevalence of asthma and the burden of disease remain high, despite efforts to improve public awareness about and medical management of asthma. Asthma is a disease of airway inflammation that has a variable natural history. Atopy is the most important risk factor for the development of asthma.

### Asthma inception: epidemiologic risk factors and natural history across the life course [^5facbb5d]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a descriptive label for an obstructive inflammatory disease in the lower airways manifesting with symptoms including breathlessness, cough, difficulty in breathing, and wheezing. From a clinician's point of view, asthma symptoms can commence at any age, although most patients with asthma — regardless of their age of onset — seem to have had some form of airway problems during childhood. Asthma inception and related pathophysiologic processes are therefore very likely to occur early in life, further evidenced by recent lung physiologic and mechanistic research. Herein, we present state-of-the-art updates on the role of genetics and epigenetics, early viral and bacterial infections, immune response, and pathophysiology, as well as lifestyle and environmental exposures, in asthma across the life course. We conclude that early environmental insults in genetically vulnerable individuals inducing abnormal, pre-asthmatic airway responses are key events in asthma inception, and we highlight disease heterogeneity across ages and the potential shortsightedness of treating all patients with asthma using the same treatments. Although there are no interventions that, at present, can modify long-term outcomes, a precision-medicine approach should be implemented to optimize treatment and tailor follow-up for all patients with asthma.

### Severe adult asthmas: integrating clinical features, biology, and therapeutics to improve outcomes [^72fe10f6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Compared with the understanding of many core pulmonary diseases, the understanding of asthma and severe asthma has improved exponentially over the last 20–30 years, including understanding concerning the application of precision-medicine approaches. Despite these advances, much remains to be biologically and immunologically clarified. Current "breakthrough" therapies are expensive and often inaccessible, and many patients remain poorly understood and treated. Yet conceptual understanding of "the severe asthmas" is now vastly different from what it was a mere 25 years ago, with accompanying dramatic improvement in the lives of many.

Asthma is a descriptive label for an obstructive inflammatory disease in the lower airways manifesting with symptoms including breathlessness, cough, difficulty in breathing, and wheezing. From a clinician's point of view, asthma symptoms can commence at any age, although most patients with asthma-regardless of their age of onset-seem to have had some form of airway problems during childhood. Asthma inception and related pathophysiologic processes are therefore very likely to occur early in life, further evidenced by recent lung physiologic and mechanistic research. Herein, we present state-of-the-art updates on the role of genetics and epigenetics, early viral and bacterial infections, immune response, and pathophysiology, as well as lifestyle and environmental exposures, in asthma across the life course. We conclude that early environmental insults in genetically vulnerable individuals inducing abnormal, pre-asthmatic airway responses are key events in asthma inception, and we highlight disease heterogeneity across ages and the potential shortsightedness of treating all patients with asthma using the same treatments. Although there are no interventions that, at present, can modify long-term outcomes, a precision-medicine approach should be implemented to optimize treatment and tailor follow-up for all patients with asthma.

### Asthma endotypes: a new approach to classification of disease entities within the asthma syndrome [^f8f8ee3d]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

It is increasingly clear that asthma is a complex disease made up of number of disease variants with different underlying pathophysiologies. Limited knowledge of the mechanisms of these disease subgroups is possibly the greatest obstacle in understanding the causes of asthma and improving treatment and can explain the failure to identify consistent genetic and environmental correlations to asthma. Here we describe a hypothesis whereby the asthma syndrome is divided into distinct disease entities with specific mechanisms, which we have called "asthma endotypes". An "endotype" is proposed to be a subtype of a condition defined by a distinct pathophysiological mechanism. Criteria for defining asthma endotypes on the basis of their phenotypes and putative pathophysiology are suggested. Using these criteria, we identify several proposed asthma endotypes and propose how these new definitions can be used in clinical study design and drug development to target existing and novel therapies to patients most likely to benefit. This PRACTALL (PRACtical ALLergy) consensus report was produced by experts from the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

### Novel potential treatable traits in asthma: where is the research taking us? [^f04a32c7]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2022). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a complex, heterogeneous disease in which the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Patients are often grouped into phenotypes (based on clinical, biologic, and physiologic characteristics) and endotypes (based on distinct genetic or molecular mechanisms). Recently, patients with asthma have been broadly split into 2 phenotypes based on their levels of type 2 inflammation: type 2 and non-type 2 asthma. However, this approach is likely oversimplified, and our understanding of the non-type 2 mechanisms in asthma remains extremely limited. A better understanding of asthma phenotypes and endotypes may assist in development of drugs for new therapeutic targets in asthma. One approach is to identify "treatable traits", which are specific patient characteristics related to phenotypes and endotypes that can be targeted by therapies. This review will focus on emerging treatable traits in asthma and aim to describe novel patient subgroups and endotypes that may represent the next step in the search for new therapeutic approaches.

### Recent advances in asthma genetics [^b6231eb6]. Respiratory Research (2008). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The pathogenesis of asthma, a complex disease, involves gene-gene interactions as well as gene-environment interactions. Multiple modest risk factors work synergistically to influence asthma disease susceptibility. The number of asthma-susceptibility genes identified by genetic studies is still increasing. However, most studies lack information on the mechanism by which the SNPs lead to asthma. Elucidating the functional consequences of SNPs is essential to confirm association results and to understand how the SNPs combine to influence susceptibility. Eventually, results from this important field are expected to improve preventive strategies and to aid in the development of diagnostic tools and therapies.

### Untangling asthma phenotypes and endotypes [^389c136c]. Allergy (2012). Low credibility.

Asthma phenotypes have been developed to address the complexities of the disease. However, owing to a lack of longitudinal studies, little is known about the onset as well as the stability of phenotypes. Distinguishing phenotypes with regard to the severity or duration of the disease is essential. A phenotype covers the clinically relevant properties of the disease, but does not show the direct relationship to disease etiology and pathophysiology. Different pathogenetic mechanisms might cause similar asthma symptoms and might be operant in a certain phenotype. These putative mechanisms are addressed by the term 'endotype'. Classification of asthma based on endotypes provides advantages for epidemiological, genetic, and drug-related studies. A successful definition of endotypes should link key pathogenic mechanisms with the asthma phenotype. Thus, the identification of corresponding molecular biomarkers for individual pathogenic mechanism underlying phenotypes or subgroups within a phenotype is important. Whether newly defined asthma endotypes predict the individual course of asthma has to be validated in longitudinal studies. The accurate endotyping reflects natural history of asthma and should help to predict treatment response. Thus, understanding asthma endotypes might be useful in clinical practice.

### Hygiene hypothesis: fact or fiction? [^3a1853cc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

The hygiene hypothesis of asthma and allergy has recently received a swell of popularity and published supporting evidence, and has been extended to autoimmune conditions of childhood. Broadly stated, naturally occurring infections and microbial exposures might essentially immunize against the development of asthma and allergic and autoimmune diseases. If true, then reductions in nature's immunotherapy over the past century might be a major factor in the global increase of these conditions (eg, the higher prevalence of asthma and allergies in urban metropolitan areas compared with rural and farm communities) and might lead to new therapies for these conditions. Although such a unifying hypothesis has great appeal, currently it is only speculation about what might be at the end of the investigative road. How close are the current studies to establishing a causal relationship between microbial exposures and a reduction in allergic, asthmatic, and autoimmune disease prevalence? A systematic epidemiologic appraisal of the current hygiene hypothesis evidence can provide a critical analysis of what is currently known and an investigative blueprint for future studies that can ultimately prove causation and improve recommendations, interventions, and therapies.

### Understanding asthma phenotypes, endotypes, and mechanisms of disease [^b031e323]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

The model of asthma as a single entity has now been replaced by a much more complex biological network of distinct and interrelating inflammatory pathways. The term asthma is now considered an umbrella diagnosis for several diseases with distinct mechanistic pathways (endotypes) and variable clinical presentations (phenotypes). The precise definition of these endotypes is central to asthma management due to inherent therapeutic and prognostic implications. This review presents the molecular mechanisms behind the heterogeneity of airway inflammation in asthmatic patients. Asthma endotypes may be broadly regarded as type 2 (T2) high or T2-low. Several biologic agents have been approved for T2-high asthma, with numerous other therapeutics that are incipient and similarly targeted at specific molecular mechanisms. Collectively, these advances have shifted existing paradigms in the approach to asthma to tailor novel therapies.

### Discerning asthma endotypes through comorbidity mapping [^6c73a061]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is a prevalent, debilitating, and expensive condition that affects about 30 million Americans and about 300 million people worldwide. It is a heterogeneous complex syndrome that undoubtedly represents an amalgam of multiple distinct "diseases", each stemming from a different constellation of genetic variations, environmental exposure histories, and molecular mechanisms that results in a generally similar clinical diathesis. The heterogeneous nature of asthma is evidenced in its varying clinical presentations, spectrum of airway inflammation, and differences in individual responses to asthma treatments –. Moreover, the risk loci discovered by genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in very large samples of individuals with "asthma" do not account for all of the genetic risks for asthma, indicating that genetic variants in additional loci are yet to be discovered. These missing loci likely include those that contribute to specific subtypes of asthma – but acquiring sufficiently large numbers of individuals with detailed phenotypic and genetic data to study the genetics of asthma subgroups has been challenging.

### Biomarkers in asthmatic patients: has their time come to direct treatment? [^fbe572fc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Asthma is a heterogeneous disease with multiple phenotypes that have variable risk factors and responses to therapeutics. Mild-to-moderate asthma often responds to traditional medications, whereas severe disease can be refractory to inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting β-agonists, and leukotriene receptor antagonists. There is robust research into the variable phenotypes of asthma. Biomarkers help define the specific pathophysiology of different asthma phenotypes and identify potential therapeutic targets. The following review will discuss the current use of biomarkers for the diagnosis of asthma, triaging the severity of a patient's disease, and the potential efficacy of treatments. This information can be used to define certain patient populations that are more likely to respond to inhaled corticosteroids or biologics. As knowledge of patient phenotypes and endotypes and biological agents to target specific classes of asthma emerge, the ability to provide personalized care to asthmatic patients will follow.

### Recent advances in the pathophysiology of asthma [^7a4ee2d2]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

There has been an increased understanding, over the past 2 decades, that asthma is a chronic, immunologically mediated condition with a disturbance of the normal airway repair mechanism, which results in inflammatory changes and airway remodeling. The airway inflammation and remodeling together likely explain the clinical manifestations of asthma. The mechanisms by which the external environmental cues, together with the complex genetic actions, propagate the inflammatory process that characterize asthma are beginning to be understood. There is also an evolving awareness of the active participation of structural elements, such as the airway epithelium, airway smooth muscle, and endothelium, in this process. In tandem with this has come the realization that inflammatory cells respond in a coordinated, albeit dysfunctional manner, via an array of complex signaling pathways that facilitate communication between these cells; these structural elements within the lung and the bone marrow serve as reservoirs for and the source of inflammatory cells and their precursors. Although often viewed as separate mechanistic entities, so-called innate and acquired immunity often overlap in the propagation of the asthmatic response. This review examines the newer information on the pathophysiologic characteristics of asthma and focuses on papers published over the past 3 years that have helped to improve current levels of understanding.

### Novel potential treatable traits in asthma: where is the research taking us? [^1b89d600]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2022). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a complex, heterogeneous disease with variable clinical manifestations. Patients with common clinical, biologic, and physiologic characteristics (phenotypes) are grouped together to guide diagnosis, therapy, and management of asthma. However, patients within a given phenotype can show heterogeneity of disease severity and response to therapy, prompting the need for more specific disease classifications. Recently, the term endotype has been introduced to define patients with asthma by distinct genetic or molecular mechanisms underlying asthma pathology. Approaches based on endotypes and phenotypes have been proposed to optimally manage patients with asthma.

Classifying patients into phenotypes and endotypes can direct treatment toward targeting specific pathophysiologic pathways that may be dysregulated in a given phenotype or endotype. For example, asthma has been broadly split into 2 distinct phenotypes according to the degree of type 2 inflammation: type 2 and non–type 2 asthma. Of these 2 phenotypes, type 2 asthma is the better understood and more easily identifiable in patients: eosinophilic inflammation and IgE synthesis both play a key role. Non–type 2 asthma is less easily defined and may comprise several subpopulations (distinct phenotypes and endotypes) of patients with non–type 2 asthma. However, because of the heterogeneity found in asthma, there are also likely to be patients whose asthma is driven by both type 2 and non–type 2 inflammatory mechanisms. Specific mechanisms may contribute to severe asthma in certain patients who do not respond to therapies targeting type 2 asthma alone. A greater understanding of the phenotypes and endotypes involved in asthma pathology will help to identify patients who are more to likely benefit from established or novel or emerging targeted therapies.

### Asthma end points and outcomes: what have we learned? [^d8ea0013]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

In spite of the wide prevalence of asthma and its substantial consequences, the diagnosis and assessment of asthma has not been standardized, and the goals of therapy currently are not being achieved. Our purpose is to help delineate what the most important asthma end points are and what kinds of strategies we should use to guide therapy. Comparison of numerous studies reveals that asthma measures used routinely in the clinic, such as spirometric lung function, do not uniformly correlate with asthma control. We cannot improve outcomes until we determine which measures reveal the underlying disease process most clearly and at the same time offer ease of performance during routine office visits. We propose that by standardizing the way we collect and analyze data from our daily practice, we can better define which measures reflect true asthma control. Such measures most likely address a spectrum of changes occurring in the pathophysiology of asthma, notably distal airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness. Inflammation may provide the best opportunity for assessment and treatment, because if it is adequately addressed, airway sensitivity may improve, thereby reducing airway obstruction and subsequently minimizing exacerbations. The fraction of exhaled nitric oxide as a measure of inflammation is suggested as offering the best combination of disease evaluation and practical implementation for improved asthma outcomes.

### Discovering susceptibility genes for asthma and allergy [^e25679ce]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Asthma and asthma-related traits are complex diseases with strong genetic and environmental components. Rapid progress in asthma genetics has led to the identification of several candidate genes that are associated with asthma-related traits. Typically the phenotypic impact of each of these genes, including the ones most often replicated in association studies, is mild, but larger effects may occur when multiple variants synergize within a permissive environmental context. Despite the achievements made in asthma genetics formidable challenges remain. The development of novel, powerful tools for gene discovery, and a closer integration of genetics and biology, should help to overcome these challenges.

### Decoding the genetic and epigenetic basis of asthma [^e406c620]. Allergy (2023). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a complex and heterogeneous chronic inflammatory disease of the airways. Alongside environmental factors, asthma susceptibility is strongly influenced by genetics. Given its high prevalence and our incomplete understanding of the mechanisms underlying disease susceptibility, asthma is frequently studied in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which have identified thousands of genetic variants associated with asthma development. Virtually all these genetic variants reside in non-coding genomic regions, which has obscured the functional impact of asthma-associated variants and their translation into disease-relevant mechanisms. Recent advances in genomics technology and epigenetics now offer methods to link genetic variants to gene regulatory elements embedded within non-coding regions, which have started to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the complex (epi)genetics of asthma. Here, we provide an integrated overview of (epi)genetic variants associated with asthma, focusing on efforts to link these disease associations to biological insight into asthma pathophysiology using state-of-the-art genomics methodology. Finally, we provide a perspective as to how decoding the genetic and epigenetic basis of asthma has the potential to transform clinical management of asthma and to predict the risk of asthma development.

### Severe asthma phenotypes-how should they guide evaluation and treatment? [^e607e8b3]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Although patients with "severe" asthma tend to be characterized by ongoing symptoms and airway inflammation despite treatment with high doses of inhaled and systemic corticosteroids, there is increasing recognition of marked phenotypic heterogeneity within affected patients. Although "precision medicine" approaches for patients with severe asthma are needed, there are many hurdles that must be overcome in daily practice. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP) has been at the forefront of phenotype discovery in severe asthma for the past decade. SARP, along with other international groups, has described clinical severe asthma phenotypes in both adults and children that can be evaluated in the clinical setting. Although these clinical phenotypes provide a good "starting point" for addressing disease heterogeneity in severe asthma in everyday practice, more efforts are needed to understand how these phenotypes relate to underlying disease mechanisms and pharmacological treatment responses. This review highlights the clinical asthma phenotypes identified to date, their associations with underlying endotypes and potential biomarkers, and remaining knowledge gaps that must be addressed before precision medicine can become a reality for patients with severe asthma.

### Exacerbation-prone asthma: a biological phenotype or a social construct [^02731bf6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a complex syndrome with multiple phenotypes and endotypes. Asthma exacerbations are not only the clearest indictor of the morbidity of asthma and of the risk for mortality due to asthma, but also comprise a significant amount of the cost to care for poorly controlled asthma. There continues to be significant disparity in the prevalence, mortality, and morbidity due to asthma. Patients with asthma who suffer recurrent exacerbations are considered to have exacerbation-prone asthma (EPA). Efforts to characterize patients with frequent exacerbations show that the etiology is likely multifactorial. Research to determine the intrinsic risk factors for EPA include studies of both genetic and inflammatory biomarkers. External factors contributing to exacerbations have been extensively reviewed and include viral infection, environmental exposures, air pollution, and psychosocial and economic barriers to optimizing health. It is likely that EPA occurs when patients who have an increased underlying intrinsic/biological risk are placed in a given exposome (environments with a variety of exposures and triggers including allergens, pollution, stress, barriers, and occupational exposures). It is the social construct combined with underlying biology that frequently drives an EPA phenotype.

### Recent advances in the immunopathogenesis of severe asthma [^8ecb2f5f]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Severe asthma is a heterogeneous disease encompassing different phenotypes and endotypes. Although patients with severe asthma constitute a small proportion of the total population with asthma, they largely account for the morbidity and mortality associated with asthma, indicating a clear unmet need. Being distinct from mild and moderate disease, new insights into the immunopathogenesis of severe asthma are needed. The disease endotypes have provided better insights into the immunopathogenic mechanisms underlying severe asthma. Current stratified approach of treating severe asthma based on phenotypes is met with shortcomings, necessitating unbiased multidimensional endotyping to cope with disease complexity. Therefore, in this review, we explore the distinct endotypes and their mechanistic pathways that characterize the heterogeneity observed in severe asthma.

### Asthma phenotypes and endotypes: a personalized approach to treatment [^7409e4ac]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Asthma is quite common and is better described as a syndrome with a heterogeneous presentation than as a single disease. Although most individuals can be effectively managed using a guideline-directed approach to care, those with the most severe illness may benefit from a more targeted therapy. The review describes our current understanding of how asthma phenotypes (observable characteristics) and endotypes (specific biologic mechanisms) can be employed to gain insight into asthma pathobiology and personalized therapy.

Recent Findings

Our understanding of the heterogeneity of asthma is increasing. The concept of asthma phenotype has become more complex, incorporating both clinical and biologic features. Several asthma endotypes (e.g., allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis, aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, severe late-onset hypereosinophilic asthma, etc.) have been proposed, but further research is needed to delineate specific mechanisms underlying asthma pathogenesis. Several biologic therapies targeting certain phenotypes are in development and are expected to broaden our armamentarium for treatment of severe asthma.

Summary

Asthma is a heterogeneous condition with diverse characteristics and biologic mechanisms. Severe asthma is associated with significant morbidity and even mortality and represents a major unmet need. Stratification of asthma subtypes into phenotypes and endotypes should move the field forward in terms of more effective and personalized treatment.

### Asthma [^76691807]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Asthma is one of the most common chronic non-communicable diseases worldwide and is characterised by variable airflow obstruction, causing dyspnoea and wheezing. Highly effective therapies are available; asthma morbidity and mortality have vastly improved in the past 15 years, and most patients can attain good asthma control. However, undertreatment is still common, and improving patient and health-care provider understanding of when and how to adjust treatment is crucial. Asthma management consists of a cycle of assessment of asthma control and risk factors and adjustment of medications accordingly. With the introduction of biological therapies, management of severe asthma has entered the precision medicine era-a shift that is driving clinical ambitions towards disease remission. Patients with severe asthma often have co-existing conditions contributing to their symptoms, mandating a multidimensional management approach. In this Seminar, we provide a clinically focused overview of asthma; epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management in children and adults.

### The effects of the environment on asthma disease activity [^70706b14]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Asthma is highly prevalent and causes significant morbidity in children. The development of asthma depends on complex relationships between genetic predisposition and environmental modifiers of immune function. The biological and physical environmental factors include aeroallergens, microbiome, endotoxin, genetics, and pollutants. The psychosocial environment encompasses stress, neighborhood safety, housing, and discrimination. They all have been speculated to influence asthma control and the risk of developing asthma. Control of the factors that contribute to or aggravate symptoms, interventions to eliminate allergen exposure, guidelines-based pharmacologic therapy, and education of children and their caregivers are of paramount importance.

### Pathophysiology of asthma: lessons from genetic research with particular focus on severe asthma [^4cf758c0]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

There is good evidence that both inherited and environmental factors influence the risk of developing asthma. Only recently, large well-designed studies have been undertaken with the power to identify the genetic causes for asthma, and methods developed in parallel with the Human Genome Project, such as gene expression and epigenetic studies, have made large-scale analyses of functional genetics possible. In this review, we discuss the recent findings from genetic and genomic research studies of asthma, particularly severe asthma, and highlight specific genes for which there are multiple lines of evidence for involvement in asthma pathogenesis. Bio-ontologic enrichment analyses of the most recently identified asthma-related genes point to attributes such as 'molecular and signal transducer activity' and 'immune system processes', which indicates the importance of immunoregulation and inflammatory response in the pathogenesis of asthma. Finally, we discuss how genetic and environmental factors jointly influence asthma susceptibility and summarize how the results may increase understanding of the pathophysiology of asthma-related diseases.

### The environment, epigenome, and asthma [^357f44e2]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Asthma prevalence has been on the increase, especially in North America compared with other continents. However, the prevalence of asthma differs worldwide, and in many countries the prevalence is stable or decreasing. This highlights the influence of environmental exposures, such as allergens, air pollution, and the environmental microbiome, on disease etiology and pathogenesis. The epigenome might provide the unifying mechanism that translates the influence of environmental exposures to changes in gene expression, respiratory epithelial function, and immune cell skewing that are hallmarks of asthma. In this review we will introduce the concept of the environmental epigenome in asthmatic patients, summarize previous publications of relevance to this field, and discuss future directions.

### Asthma phenotypes: the evolution from clinical to molecular approaches [^447801eb]. Nature Medicine (2012). Excellent credibility.

Although asthma has been considered as a single disease for years, recent studies have increasingly focused on its heterogeneity. The characterization of this heterogeneity has promoted the concept that asthma consists of multiple phenotypes or consistent groupings of characteristics. Asthma phenotypes were initially focused on combinations of clinical characteristics, but they are now evolving to link biology to phenotype, often through a statistically based process. Ongoing studies of large-scale, molecularly and genetically focused and extensively clinically characterized cohorts of asthma should enhance our ability to molecularly understand these phenotypes and lead to more targeted and personalized approaches to asthma therapy.

### Diagnosis and management of asthma in adults: a review [^ef21ba40]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on asthma:

- **Definition**: Asthma is a chronic disorder of the lower respiratory tract characterized by bronchial hyperresponsiveness and reversible airflow obstruction presenting with episodic or persistent symptoms of wheezing, dyspnea, and cough.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of asthma is complex and not fully understood. It involves a combination of genetic and environmental factors that lead to airway inflammation, hyperresponsiveness, and remodeling. Exposure to allergens triggers an inflammatory response in the airways, leading to bronchoconstriction, increased mucus production, and airway remodeling.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of asthma in the US is estimated at 8.2% in the general population involving all ages.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for asthma include a genetic predisposition, atopy, and exposure to environmental factors, such as air pollutants, volatile organic compounds, benzene, formaldehyde, tetrachloroethylene, toluene, xylenes, cleaning agents, insecticides, dampness, mould, and allergens. Additionally, respiratory infections and a personal or family history of allergies are significant risk factors.
- **Disease course**: The clinical manifestations of asthma include recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing. These symptoms can vary in frequency and severity and are often worse at night or in the early morning.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of asthma can vary widely among patients. It is generally a controllable chronic condition that can lead to a good QoL with appropriate treatment and lifestyle modifications.

### Mechanisms of severe asthma [^1df72805]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2003). Low credibility.

The mechanisms behind the development of severe asthma are poorly understood. However, these patients disproportionately consume healthcare resources related to asthma. Severe asthma may develop over time, or may develop shortly after onset of the disease. The genetic and environmental elements that may be most important in the development of severe disease are poorly understood. Physiologically, these patients often have air trapping and airway collapsibility. The pathology demonstrates a heterogeneity of findings, including continued eosinophilic inflammation, an apparently different pathology, structural changes likely to be remodelling related, and predominant distal disease. Treatment remains problematic and likely will remain so until a better understanding of this disease develops.

### Pathophysiology of severe asthma [^f4dae108]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2000). Low credibility.

Although asthma affects nearly 8% of the adult population, most of these patients have mild-to-moderate disease that can be controlled with appropriate treatment. It is estimated, however, that 5% to 10% of patients with asthma have severe disease that is unresponsive to typical therapeutics, including corticosteroids. Because patients with severe asthma are disproportionately affected by their disease, in terms of both impaired lifestyle and health care costs, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute sponsored a workshop on the pathogenesis of severe asthma. The goals of this workshop were to begin to define the characteristics of severe asthma. In these discussions, it was clear that many characteristics need to be considered in defining this phenotype of asthma, including symptoms, intensity of therapy (including administration of systemic corticosteroids), and impairment of lung function. Also discussed were potential mechanisms of severe asthma including the role of allergic diseases, which may play less of a role in severe asthma than in mild-to-moderate disease, and infections. A major limitation to control of severe asthma is the recalcitrant response of these patients to usual therapy including systemic corticosteroids; the potential of other therapies was reviewed. From these discussions, recommendations were made for future research needs to gain insights into a difficult therapeutic and possibly novel mechanistic area of asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^f03c98ad]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Unanswered clinical questions in patients with overlapping features of asthma and COPD — there is an urgent need for more research to guide better recognition and safe and effective treatment, because patients who do not have 'classical' features of asthma or of COPD, or who have features of both, have generally been excluded from randomized controlled trials of most therapeutic interventions for airways disease, and from many mechanistic studies. Future research should include study of clinical and physiological characteristics, biomarkers, outcomes and underlying mechanisms among broad populations of patients with respiratory symptoms or with chronic airflow limitation. In the meantime, the present chapter provides interim advice about diagnosis and initial treatment from the perspective of clinicians, particularly those in primary care and nonpulmonary specialties, and further research is needed to inform evidence-based definitions, to provide a more detailed classification of these patients, and to encourage the development of specific interventions for clinical use.

### Genetic aspects of the etiology and treatment of asthma [^4885198d]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

This article provides a clinical review of the genetic aspects of the etiology and treatment of asthma for pediatric practitioners who are experienced in asthma diagnosis and management but lack expertise in genetics and immunology. Asthma is caused by the interaction of genetic susceptibility with environmental factors. The asthmatic response is characterized by elevated production of IgE, cytokines, and chemokines; mucus hypersecretion; airway obstruction; eosinophilia; and enhanced airway hyperreactivity to spasmogens. The genes most clearly associated with asthma include disintegrin and metalloprotease ADAM-33, dipeptidyl peptidase 10, PHD finger protein 11, and the prostanoid DP1 receptor. Within a few years, practitioners may apply sophisticated knowledge of cell and molecular biology to expand pharmacotherapeutic approaches and to personalize diagnosis and management.

### Using single nucleotide polymorphisms as a means to understanding the pathophysiology of asthma [^5543b959]. Respiratory Research (2001). Low credibility.

Asthma is the most common chronic childhood disease in the developed nations, and is a complex disease that has high social and economic costs. Studies of the genetic etiology of asthma offer a way of improving our understanding of its pathogenesis, with the goal of improving preventive strategies, diagnostic tools, and therapies. Considerable effort and expense have been expended in attempts to detect specific polymorphisms in genetic loci contributing to asthma susceptibility. Concomitantly, the technology for detecting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) has undergone rapid development, extensive catalogues of SNPs across the genome have been constructed, and SNPs have been increasingly used as a method of investigating the genetic etiology of complex human diseases. This paper reviews both current and potential future contributions of SNPs to our understanding of asthma pathophysiology.

Discussion

The questions addressed in our analyses are among those that would seem most meaningful to people who have asthma in a time of high respiratory-related morbidity and mortality from a novel infectious disease of unclear etiology, one for which there is limited treatment. The public health significance of these questions is underscored by the high worldwide prevalence of asthma and the relatively rapid appearance in the literature of many studies addressing aspects of the association between asthma and COVID-19. However, the results and conclusions presented here should be viewed in light of the likelihood that the results of many additional relevant studies will be available in the near future.

### Is airway remodeling clinically relevant in asthma? [^2f15db86]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The social and economic impact of asthma is substantial worldwide. Although current therapies targeting both airway inflammation and airway hyperreactivity effectively relieve and prevent symptoms in the majority of patients, some patients experience persistent symptoms and a progressive decline in lung function, described as irreversible or refractory asthma. Indeed, there are many unanswered questions about the role of airway remodeling in asthma. This review addresses several topics of controversy, including whether all patients with asthma demonstrate airway remodeling; the contribution of distinct airway resident cells to the development of remodeling; the role of biomarkers or noninvasive measurements in predicting airway remodeling; and the effectiveness of current therapies on airway remodeling and disease progression.

### An official American Thoracic Society research statement: current challenges facing research and therapeutic advances in airway remodeling [^fe1893dd]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society research statement — conclusions on airway remodeling (AR) in asthma state that a contributory role of AR in asthma pathogenesis and pathobiology is largely accepted, although which features are causally important remains debated; alterations in multiple cell types occur with AR and their impact likely varies by age, sex, disease severity, etiology, responsiveness to therapy, and other factors; understanding AR mechanisms and their impact on disease is key to development of anti-AR therapies; significant barriers exist, including limitations in defining AR parameters, lack of appropriate tissue samples or longitudinal sampling approaches for a slowly progressing process, lack of biomarkers, technological limitations in noninvasively assessing AR, and overall lack of enthusiasm from funding agencies, regulatory agencies, and the pharmaceutical industry for a protracted process with unclear regulatory indications; nonetheless, given the emerging and increasingly established importance of AR in asthma, there need to be clear educational, research, funding, and regulatory advancements toward enhancing research into AR and development of novel therapies to blunt this process.

### It's time to rethink mite allergen avoidance [^7556ac9a]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

The role of allergen exposure in the etiology of allergic sensitization and asthma is complex. Advice on strategies to avoid domestic allergens remains contentious because trials of interventions aimed to prevent asthma or reduce symptoms have often failed to demonstrate benefits. Asthma management guidelines differ widely in their recommendations, while Web-based information often claims benefits associated with products. In this rostrum we argue that although many factors have a role in both the etiology and the exacerbation of asthma, allergen exposure probably remains an important contributor to the manifestations of the disease. Currently, there is no evidence-based framework for effective domestic allergen avoidance interventions to reduce chronic aeroallergen exposure. The development of an effective approach to allergen avoidance requires a better understanding of (a) the physical nature of chronic aeroallergen exposure and methods for measuring and reducing this, (b) the interaction between allergen exposure and innate immune modulators at different disease stages, and (c) markers enabling the identification of individuals who would benefit from this. The strategic risk of overemphasizing other novel mechanisms and approaches to asthma management is that we will prematurely abandon and fail to improve an existing approach that could have a significant impact on the development, progression, and symptoms of the disease.

Asthma, and severe asthma, in particular, is increasingly recognized as a heterogeneous disease. While traditional views of asthma have centered around a childhood onset disease with an allergic component, several large scale network studies are now confirming that severe asthma can present in multiple different ways, only 30–50% of which meet traditional childhood onset allergic criteria. To understand the different groups better, initial studies have attempted to define phenotypes of severe asthma. A phenotype is defined as the integration of different characteristics that are the product of the interaction of the patient's genes with the environment. Both clinical and statistical approaches have identified at least 3–5 phenotypes of severe asthma. However, these phenotypes, in isolation, do not identify the immunopathology that makes these clinical phenotypes distinct or identifies a target population for a specific approach to therapy. As biological characteristics are identified, phenotypes should continue to evolve towards asthma endotypes. The identification of these endotypes, either by matching biology, genetics and therapeutic responses to therapy with clinically or statistically defined phenotypes or through unbiased genetic and genomic approaches, remains limited. Moving forward, this integration of genetics, biology and clinical characteristics should substantially enhance our ability to effectively treat complex heterogeneous diseases, such as severe asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^bb0b9757]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention — definition and description: Asthma is a heterogeneous disease, usually characterized by chronic airway inflammation and is defined by the history of respiratory symptoms that vary over time and in intensity together with variable expiratory airflow limitation; airflow limitation may later become persistent. Asthma is usually associated with airway hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation, but these are not necessary or sufficient to make the diagnosis, and it is a common, chronic respiratory disease affecting 1–29% of the population in different countries, with variations often triggered by factors such as exercise, allergen or irritant exposure, change in weather, or viral respiratory infections.

### Time-dependent gene-environment interactions are essential drivers of asthma initiation and persistence [^605cbb28]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2024). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a clinical syndrome caused by heterogeneous underlying mechanisms with some of them having a strong genetic component. It is known that up to 82% of atopic asthma has a genetic background with the rest being influenced by environmental factors that cause epigenetic modification(s) of gene expression. The interaction between the gene(s) and the environment has long been regarded as the most likely explanation of asthma initiation and persistence. Lately, much attention has been given to the time frame the interaction occurs since the host response (immune or biological) to environmental triggers, differs at different developmental ages. The integration of the time variant into asthma pathogenesis is appearing to be equally important as the gene(s)-environment interaction. It seems that, all three factors should be present to trigger the asthma initiation and persistence cascade. Herein, we introduce the importance of the time variant in asthma pathogenesis and emphasize the long-term clinical significance of the time-dependent gene-environment interactions in childhood.

### Epidemiology of infections and development of asthma [^7c9c2ead]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Asthma and allergic diseases have become more prevalent, although the reasons for this increase in disease burden are not known. Understanding why these diseases have become more common requires knowledge of the disease pathogenesis. Multiple studies have identified respiratory viral infections and atypical bacteria as potential etiologic agents underlying the development of asthma (and possibly allergies). This review discusses the epidemiology and potential mechanistic studies that provide links between these infectious agents and the development (and exacerbation) of asthma. These studies provide insight into the increase in disease prevalence and have identified potential targets for future therapeutic intervention.

### Improving asthma outcomes: clinicians' perspectives on peripheral airways [^c0ba514c]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a common and well-known diagnosis to specialists, general practitioners, and the general public. Decades of research has shed much light on the nature of asthma, but as is often the case, it raises more questions, and importantly causality and pathophysiology remain very poorly understood. Perhaps the push to simplify the concept and hence its management has been detrimental, given that its clinical spectrum is broad and complex and a simple approach to treatment does not match the reality of this complexity. The authors strongly argue that better characterization of pathophysiology, be they called phenotypes, traits, or biomarkers, is required to improve management and to advance research. Respiratory physiology has a fundamental role in diagnosis and management of airways diseases and is the functional representation of both inflammation and lung and airway remodeling. Peripheral airways disease is an integral part of asthma, and the ability to measure function of the peripheral airways has allowed studies that reveal the importance of small airway function in asthma. Is this useful for clinicians and researchers? In this article, we explain what aspects of peripheral airway dysfunction are clinically important, and how this informs assessment and management.

### Recent advances in severe asthma: from phenotypes to personalized medicine [^843fa2b5]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

This review focuses on recent clinical and translational discoveries in severe and uncontrolled asthma that now enable phenotyping and personalized therapies in these patients. Although asthma is common in both children and adults and typically responds to standard therapies, a subset of individuals with asthma experience severe and/or persistent symptoms despite appropriate therapies. Airflow obstruction leading to frequent symptoms requiring higher levels of controller therapy is the cardinal feature of severe asthma, but the underlying molecular mechanisms, or endotypes, are diverse and variable between individuals. Two major risk factors that contribute to severe asthma are genetics and environmental exposures that modulate immune responses, and although these often interact in complex manners that are not fully understood, certain endotypes converge in severe asthma. A number of studies have evaluated various features of patients with severe asthma and classified patients into phenotypes with clinical relevance. This phenotyping is now incorporated into clinical practice and can be used to guide advanced biological therapies that target specific molecules and inflammatory pathways that contribute to asthma pathogenesis.

### Heterogeneity and the origins of asthma [^d8a2bbbc]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the roots of asthma across different ages, including atopy, the role of the microbiome and viral infections, and comorbidities and confounders, such as obesity, aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, neutrophilic asthma, cigarette smoking, and the possibility of an asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome.

Data Sources

Data were taken from various scientific search engines, including PubMed and Science Direct databases.

Study Selections

Articles that reviewed information on the origins of asthma in persons of all ages, including different phenotypes and genotypes of asthma, were used.

Results

Asthma is a common and complex disease whose origins are likely a combination of both genetic predisposition and environmental exposures. Factors such as the microbiome, other atopic disease, viral infections in young children, and other diagnoses, such as obesity or aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, are important to consider when creating a treatment plan for patients.

Conclusion

Asthma is a disease that is often diagnosed in childhood but can present at any age. There is debate in the field as to whether asthma is one disease or several different diseases that include airway inflammation as a key finding. There are risk factors for disease in the environment and through comorbidities that likely play significant roles in the origins of asthma, the development of symptoms, and the response to treatment. These factors are even more important as we look toward the future with the goal of personalized medicine.

### Asthma [^1d7a819d]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Asthma-one of the most common chronic, non-communicable diseases in children and adults-is characterised by variable respiratory symptoms and variable airflow limitation. Asthma is a consequence of complex gene-environment interactions, with heterogeneity in clinical presentation and the type and intensity of airway inflammation and remodelling. The goal of asthma treatment is to achieve good asthma control-ie, to minimise symptom burden and risk of exacerbations. Anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator treatments are the mainstay of asthma therapy and are used in a stepwise approach. Pharmacological treatment is based on a cycle of assessment and re-evaluation of symptom control, risk factors, comorbidities, side-effects, and patient satisfaction by means of shared decisions. Asthma is classed as severe when requiring high-intensity treatment to keep it under control, or if it remains uncontrolled despite treatment. New biological therapies for treatment of severe asthma, together with developments in biomarkers, present opportunities for phenotype-specific interventions and realisation of more personalised treatment. In this Seminar, we provide a clinically focused overview of asthma, including epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical diagnosis, asthma phenotypes, severe asthma, acute exacerbations, and clinical management of disease in adults and children older than 5 years. Emerging therapies, controversies, and uncertainties in asthma management are also discussed.

### Asthma exacerbations: pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment [^b0338993]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Guideline-based management of asthma focuses on disease severity and choosing the appropriate medical therapy to control symptoms and reduce the risk of exacerbations. However, irrespective of asthma severity and often despite optimal medical therapy, patients may experience acute exacerbations of symptoms and a loss of disease control. Asthma exacerbations are most commonly triggered by viral respiratory infections, particularly with human rhinovirus. Given the importance of these events to asthma morbidity and health care costs, we will review common inciting factors for asthma exacerbations and approaches to prevent and treat these events.

### Can we treat airway remodeling? [^b03564a6]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic disease that has been associated with structural changes of the airway wall. These changes lead to decreased reversibility of airway obstruction and have been understood as poorly reversible. Recent studies have proved that even some of the processes involved in airway remodeling may be reversible with early detection of the disease and appropriate anti inflammatory treatment. New treatments should be directed not only against inflammation itself but also against these chronic changes.

### Environmental exposures and respiratory outcomes in children [^b5c0b10c]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Asthma is a complex condition where genetic and environmental interactions occur at critical periods in development. The focus of this review was the role of environmental exposures on asthma causation. Selected studies published in 2010 and 2011 were reviewed to illustrate the challenge in relating environmental exposure(s) on asthma causation and also to focus on some exposures currently thought to be important to asthma pathogenesis. Challenges in understanding how environmental exposures may translate into asthma causation are summarised. Inhaled and ingested exposures are described, including microbial products, swimming pools, diet and antenatal tobacco exposure. A final synthesis summarises what is currently understood about childhood asthma causation and what advice might be given to parents and governments interested in reducing asthma risk.

### Microbes and asthma: opportunities for intervention [^c3fe20a9]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

The worldwide incidence and prevalence of asthma continues to increase. Asthma is now understood as an umbrella term for different phenotypes or endotypes, which arise through different pathophysiologic pathways. Understanding the many factors contributing to development of the disease is important for the identification of novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of certain asthma phenotypes. The hygiene hypothesis has been formulated to explain the increasing prevalence of allergic disease, including asthma. This hypothesis postulates that decreased exposure at a young age to certain infectious agents as a result of improved hygiene, increased antibiotic use and vaccination, and changes in lifestyle and dietary habits is associated with changes in the immune system, which predispose subjects to allergy. Many microbes, during their coevolution with human subjects, developed mechanisms to manipulate the human immune system and to increase their chances of survival. Improving models of asthma, as well as choosing adequate end points in clinical trials, will lead to a more complete understanding of the underlying mechanisms, thus providing an opportunity to devise primary and secondary interventions at the same time as identifying new molecular targets for treatment. This article reports the discussion and conclusion of a workshop under the auspices of the Netherlands Lung Foundation to extend our understanding of how modulation of the immune system by bacterial, parasitic, and viral infections might affect the development of asthma and to map out future lines of investigation.

### Asthma: a major pediatric health issue [^3607dea2]. Respiratory Research (2002). Low credibility.

Conclusion

There has been a considerable increase in the incidence, prevalence, and mortality of asthma in children in the past three to four decades, with some decline in the most recent decade. These trends are particularly marked and of greatest concern in preschool children. Internationally, there are huge variations from one country and one continent to another. There is currently no unifying hypothesis to explain these trends and associated risk factors. Environmental factors that may lead to asthma include air pollution. Genetic factors, the hygiene hypothesis, and lifestyle differences may also contribute. In addition, these trends and risk factors may differ between populations. It is possible that immunologic events and airway remodeling in early childhood may contribute to the persistence of wheeze and development of asthma. Further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.

### Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: common genes, common environments? [^1e5dba3f]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) show similarities and substantial differences. The Dutch hypothesis stipulated that asthma and COPD have common genetic and environmental risk factors (allergens, infections, smoking), which ultimately lead to clinical disease depending on the timing and type of environmental exposures (Postma and Boezen, Chest 2004;126:96S-104S). Thus, a particular group of shared genetic factors may lead to asthma when combined with specific environmental factors that are met at a certain stage in life, whereas combination with other environmental factors, or similar environmental factors at a different stage in life, will lead toward COPD. Multiple genes have been found for asthma and COPD. In addition to genes unique to these diseases, some shared genetic risk factors exist. Moreover, there are both common host risk factors and environmental risk factors for asthma and COPD. Here we put forward, based on the data available, that genes that affect lung development in utero and lung growth in early childhood in interaction with environmental detrimental stimuli, such as smoking and air pollution, are contributing to asthma in childhood and the ultimate development of COPD. Additional genes and environmental factors then drive specific immunological mechanisms underlying asthma, and others may contribute to the ultimate development of specific subtypes of COPD (i.e., airway disease with mucous hypersecretion, small airway disease, and emphysema). The genetic predisposition to the derailment of certain pathways may further help to define subgroups of asthma and COPD. In the end this may lead to stratification of patients by their genetic make-up and open new therapeutic prospects.

### Asthma: defining of the persistent adult phenotypes [^af8c4599]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

The common disease asthma is probably not a single disease, but rather a complex of multiple, separate syndromes that overlap. Although clinicians have recognised these different phenotypes for many years, they have remained poorly characterised, with little known about the underlying pathobiology contributing to them. Development of targeted therapies for asthma, and phenotype-specific clinical trials have raised interest in these phenotypes. Improved understanding of these phenotypes in complex diseases such as asthma will also improve our ability to link specific genotypes to their associated disease, which should help development of biomarkers. However, there is no standardised method to define asthma phenotypes. This Review analyses some of the methods that have been used to define asthma phenotypes and proposes an integrated method of classification to improve our understanding of these phenotypes.

### Prevalence and risk factors for childhood asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e5200eed]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the different definitions, the observed prevalences of childhood asthma are relatively close, with all estimates falling within a narrow range of 10–11%. Several factors may contribute to this similarity: the different definitions, while varying in their specific criteria, often overlap in the types of symptoms and conditions they capture. For example, a child with asthma who requires medical attention (care-defined) is also likely to be diagnosed by a physician and may report their condition in a survey; the overall prevalence of childhood asthma in the studied populations may be relatively stable, meaning that even with different definitions, the underlying burden of the disease remains consistent. This suggests that the core population of children with asthma is being captured across the different definitions; and the clinical practice of diagnosing and managing asthma may be well-established, leading to consistent reporting and management practices. This can result in similar prevalence rates across different definitions, as the same children are likely to be identified regardless of the method used.

### Complex interactions of pollutant and allergen exposures and their impact on people with asthma [^476ea1f7]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Pediatric asthma has many causes and can manifest differently in different children and at different times. Understanding the many factors related to the development and exacerbation of asthma is complicated by the complexity of the many environmental exposures related to asthma development and morbidity. Furthermore, the same environmental exposures that may cause increased symptoms at 1 point in time may be protective when the exposure occurs earlier or at high enough levels. We know that environmental exposures such as allergens, irritants, and pollutants are quite complex in their composition; further examination of this complexity may improve our understanding of this complex and highly prevalent disease.

### Breaking new ground: challenging existing asthma guidelines [^dbb9507f]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is estimated to affect 300 million people worldwide, with an expected increase to 400 million worldwide by 2025. A chronic inflammatory disease of the airways, asthma causes 0.25 million deaths annually and substantial socioeconomic burden around the globe. Moreover, despite the development and dissemination in recent years of both international guidelines and various national guidelines for asthma diagnosis and management, there is evidence that asthma is frequently not well controlled in many children and adults. In this paper we review the limitations of current asthma guidelines and describe important issues and remaining questions regarding asthma guidelines for use in primary care practice.

### Risk and protective factors for the development of childhood asthma [^84e5205d]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Childhood asthma prevalence worldwide has been increasing markedly over several decades. Various theories have been proposed to account for this alarming trend. The disease has a broad spectrum of potential determinants ranging from genetics to lifestyle and environmental factors. Epidemiological observations have demonstrated that several important lifestyle and environmental factors including obesity, urban living, dietary patterns such as food low in antioxidants and fast food, non-breastfeeding, gut flora imbalance, cigarette smoking, air pollution, and viral infection are associated with asthma exacerbations in children. However, only environmental tobacco smoke has been associated with the development of asthma. Despite epidemiological studies indicating that many other factors are probably associated with the development of asthma, the relationships are not considered causal due to the inadequate evidence and inconsistent results from recent studies. This may highlight that sufficient data and exact mechanisms of causality are still in need of further study.

### Innate immunity in asthma [^26cd053c]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Asthma is a complex disorder and evidence now suggests that it is not solely attributable either to allergy or eosinophilia. Non-eosinophilic asthma accounts for up to one half of all cases and a large proportion have a non-allergic aetiology. The innate immune system responds to a variety of triggers, including viral and bacterial components which are known non-allergic triggers of asthma. The innate immune response may be involved in both the development of and protection against asthma. Factors which are likely to determine the nature of the response include the timing of the exposure (childhood or adulthood), baseline asthma inflammatory subtype (eosinophilic or non-eosinophilic) and the dose of the exposure. Gene-environment interactions are likely to modify the response. Further research is required to elucidate the specific mechanisms involved in the innate immune response in asthma and will be important in the identification of new targets for therapy and management.

### Immunobiology of the critical asthma syndrome [^427a2bab]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

It is now recognized that asthma incorporates a broad spectrum of syndromes with varying clinical manifestations. Future improvements in asthma treatment will require a clear characterization of these asthma phenotypes and the cellular mechanisms underlying these clinical manifestations. Herein, we will describe the current knowledge of asthma biology. This will include a review of the early pioneers in asthma and allergy, how this work led to our understanding of TH1 and TH2 cytokines, and the development of the "hygiene hypothesis". We will discuss the utility and limitations of the TH1-TH2 model of asthma in animal and human studies, and how this knowledge addresses controversies surrounding the hygiene hypothesis and other competing models. We will discuss novel therapies that have been developed based on mechanistic understanding of asthma pathobiology, including successes and shortcomings of these therapies. We will review the early work that led to the recognition of "asthma phenotypes". This will include the early discovery of various inflammatory subtypes in asthma and how these inflammatory subtypes correlate with response to therapy. Finally, we will describe recent discoveries in asthma biology that will include the role of the airway epithelium in asthma pathogenesis, novel cytokines important in asthma that may serve as novel therapeutic targets, and the identification of newly described innate immune cells and their role in asthma. Improved understanding of the complex biology underpinning the various asthma phenotypes is critical for our ability to optimize treatment for all patients that suffer from asthma and critical asthma syndromes.

### Asthma phenotypes and endotypes [^75ac85ef]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

It is increasingly clear that asthma is not a single disease, but a disorder with vast heterogeneity in pathogenesis, severity, and treatment response. In this review, we discuss the present understanding of different asthma phenotypes and endotypes, and the prospects of personalized medicine for asthma.

Recent Findings

The recognition of diverse biological backgrounds in which asthma, and particularly severe asthma, can manifest has prompted the search for refined phenotypes and endotypes in asthma. Such appreciation of the heterogeneity in asthma is also prompting clinical trials to focus on specific subgroups of asthma, as demonstrated by the clinical trial of lebrikizumab.

Summary

Patients with severe asthma have asthma symptoms that are difficult to control, require high dosages of medication, and continue to experience persistent symptoms, asthma exacerbations or airflow obstruction even with aggressive therapy. Although asthma is traditionally viewed as an eosinophilic inflammatory disorder associated with a T-helper cell type 2 (Th2) immune response, recent studies have identified involvement of other effector cells, nonclassical Th2 cytokines and non-Th2 cytokines in severe asthma pathogenesis. Results of several clinical trials of anticytokine antibodies demonstrated the effectiveness of tailoring asthma treatment on the basis of an individual's biology.

### Revisiting the hygiene hypothesis for allergy and asthma [^88ad5492]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

The hygiene hypothesis, which describes the protective influence of microbial exposures in early life on the development of allergy and asthma, has continued its swell of academic interest, investigation, and evolution. This article is focused on studies published in the past 3 years that have furthered the substance and shape of hygiene theory, primarily as it relates to allergic airways and asthma. Recent investigations have furthered an overarching "microbiome hypothesis" to home features, medical practices, and cleanliness behaviors that are suspects in the hygiene effect. Relatively crude markers of the protective microbial environment have been supplanted by culture-independent microbiome science, distinguishing the characteristics of potentially protective microbiomes from pathologic features. Understanding how the microbiome is shaped and affects healthful versus harmful outcomes in the human host is relatively nascent. Good clues are emerging that give mechanistic substance to the theory and could help guide microbe-based therapeutics to fill the allergy and asthma management gap in prevention and disease modification.

### The study team for early life asthma research (STELAR) consortium' asthma e-lab': team science bringing data, methods and investigators together [^a91c1ef2]. Thorax (2015). Low credibility.

Asthma epidemiology is reaching the limit of what can be achieved through conventional hypothesis-driven research, due to factors that include residual confounding, multiple influences of modest effect size and lack of statistical power to detect interactions between factors in complex datasets. Evidence is mounting that asthma is not a single disease, but a collection of several diseases, each with unique pathophysiology, and environmental and genetic associates (often referred to as 'asthma endotypes'). Some reports have proposed abolishing the term 'asthma'. This conceptual framework of 'asthma syndrome' may also explain why the responses to currently available treatments vary considerably: if asthma is an umbrella diagnosis that comprises multiple diseases with distinct mechanisms, then it is unlikely that these different diseases would always respond equally to same therapeutic agents. In this context, 'asthma phenotype' can be viewed as an observable characteristic that can be shared between several diseases ('endotypes') within the asthma syndrome, while 'asthma endotype' is a hypothetical construct that has a tangible value in helping us to better understand the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of asthma disease-related states and may help identify more effective personalised treatment strategies. However, unless better ways are found to distinguish between different endotypes, it will be difficult to discover their underlying pathophysiological processes or identify novel therapeutic targets for stratified treatment, as any signal will be diluted by phenotypical heterogeneity.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^b2dcc035]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma and wheezing in young children — burden, onset, and risk factors: Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood and a leading cause of morbidity measured by school absences, emergency department visits and hospitalizations, and it often begins in early childhood with symptoms commencing during childhood in up to half of people with asthma; onset is earlier in males than females. No intervention has yet been shown to prevent the development of asthma or modify its long-term course, and atopy is present in the majority of children with asthma who are over 3 years old, with allergen-specific sensitization (particularly multiple early-life sensitizations) cited as one of the most important risk factors for development of asthma.

### Update on asthma biology [^e612c883]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

This is an exciting time to be conducting asthma research. The recent development of targeted asthma biologics has validated the power of basic research to discover new molecules amenable to therapeutic intervention. Advances in high-throughput sequencing are providing a wealth of "omics" data about genetic and epigenetic underpinnings of asthma, as well as about new cellular interacting networks and potential endotypes in asthma. Airway epithelial cells have emerged not only as key sensors of the outside environment but also as central drivers of dysregulated mucosal immune responses in asthma. Emerging data suggest that the airway epithelium in asthma remembers prior encounters with environmental exposures, resulting in potentially long-lasting changes in structure and metabolism that render asthmatic individuals susceptible to subsequent exposures. Here we summarize recent insights into asthma biology, focusing on studies using human cells or tissue that were published in the past 2 years. The studies are organized thematically into 6 content areas to draw connections and spur future research (on genetics and epigenetics, prenatal and early-life origins, microbiome, immune and inflammatory pathways, asthma endotypes and biomarkers, and lung structural alterations). We highlight recent studies of airway epithelial dysfunction and response to viral infections and conclude with a framework for considering how bidirectional interactions between alterations in airway structure and mucosal immunity can lead to sustained lung dysfunction in asthma.

### Questions in mild asthma: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^6ad2b113]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society research statement on mild asthma — mild asthma is believed to represent the majority of patients with asthma, is variably defined with common usage referring to infrequent symptoms, and patients can face an underappreciated exacerbation burden with increased risk for impaired quality of life, accelerated lung function decline, and oral corticosteroid exposure; a panel evaluated existing literature and made recommendations for future research, and this document is meant to be a roadmap for future research and not a clinical guideline for patient care. The statement suggests research priorities in various mild asthma–related areas, including definition of mild asthma (conduct surveys of physician and patient perspectives and develop a consensus definition with utility for patients, clinicians, and researchers), phenotypes and inflammatory mechanisms (investigate inflammatory pathways using airway samples with multiomics and network analyses, describe phenotypes using a multidimensional approach including airway hyperresponsiveness, exacerbation patterns, symptom burden, and inflammation, and assess whether there is a treatment-refractory or poorly corticosteroid responsive phenotype), and disease progression and exacerbations (conduct prospective longitudinal cohort studies to identify the frequency of and risk factors for progression to more severe disease and monitor long-term outcomes of patients followed exclusively by primary care providers, while evaluating patient factors influencing the exacerbation reduction effects of mild asthma therapies).

### Asthma inception: epidemiologic risk factors and natural history across the life course [^500ea23b]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

A number of studies have additionally assessed the impact of asthma risk factors on the outcome of asthma phenotypes, suggesting that some risk factors may contribute more strongly to specific asthma phenotypes than others. This is important in estimating the individual contribution of potentially modifiable risk factors and delineating the mechanisms through which risk factors drive asthma development.

Importantly, early-life adverse exposures (tobacco smoking in particular) may lead to long-term impairment in lung health and lung function, even having transgenerational effects on the maternal and/or paternal side (potentially through epigenetic mechanisms). In utero or early-life exposures, such as nicotine or LRTIs, lead to impairment in lung health and pulmonary function, setting a trajectory that may track for life and includes development of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and premature mortality. The mechanisms of risk and protection of environmental factors are likely related to the impact of environmental exposures on the immature adaptive immune system, airway structure or function, and the gut and airway microbiome in early life.

Last, population attributable fraction (PAF) is important as a public health target, identifying risk factors with a high PAF, high exposure prevalence, and, thus, most likely to have a large modifiable impact. A prior study used 32 meta-analyses to calculate PAF and exposure prevalence during pregnancy and early-life child stages to illustrate the impact of each modifiable risk or protective factor on asthma development. The early-life risk factors with the greatest PAF included acute viral respiratory tract infections, antibiotic use, inadequate physical activity, prenatal stress, secondhand smoke exposure, and allergic sensitization. Exposures with the greatest protective PAF included breastfeeding and sufficient maternal vitamin D levels.

### Lung damage and airway remodelling in severe asthma [^47e60c51]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2012). Low credibility.

Severe asthma is a heterogeneous disease with substantial unmet clinical need. Airway damage and remodelling is a consequence of complex host-environment interactions and is considered to be the cardinal feature leading onto the development and persistence of airflow obstruction. In this review, we shall bring together recent insights into the causes of airway damage and remodelling that propose key roles for pathogens and mechanical damage in addition to allergens, underlying genetic susceptibility, inflammatory and structural cell interactions, and impaired resolution of damage. We shall consider the consequences of airway remodelling in terms of airway geometry, mechanics and clinical expression of disease. Understanding the causes and consequences of airway damage and remodelling will shed light upon the structure-function relationships required to begin to unravel the complexity of severe asthma and will enable us to target current and novel therapies as we begin to move towards realizing personalized medicine.

### Asthma inception: epidemiologic risk factors and natural history across the life course [^d396830e]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Although asthma often begins as an inappropriate response to viral infections or allergic sensitization, low socioeconomic status and medication exposure in early life have also been associated with the inception of asthma. Children who live in low-socioeconomic families are twice as likely to develop asthma by 14 years of age, whereas children who live in high-socioeconomic families are less likely (60%) to develop asthma. Furthermore, lower socioeconomic status has been associated with increased healthcare use, but not asthma mortality. This raises important questions regarding exposures to low-income environments from birth, which may underlie the development of asthma. In particular, poor housing conditions, which disproportionately affect low-income communities, may influence asthma incidence and progression through exposure to indoor allergens (pests, dust mites, molds). Several interventional studies have provided initial evidence of the efficiency of home repairs on asthma morbidity, thus calling for large research programs to guide public health policies to improve housing conditions to achieve better health equity.

### Choosing the right biologic treatment for individual patients with severe asthma-lessons learnt from picasso [^82689d02]. Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Severe asthma represents a true challenge for clinicians from two basic perspectives, i.e.: a rational assessment of the underlying endo/phenotype and the subsequent selection of the best fitted (personalized) and effective treatment. Even though asthma is a heterogeneous disease, in the majority of therapy-compliant patients, it is possible to achieve (almost) complete disease control or even remission through conventional and quite uniform step-based pharmacotherapy, even without phenotyping. However, the absence of deeper assessment of individual patients revealed its handicap to its fullest extent during the first years of the new millennium upon the launch of biological therapeutics for patients with the most severe forms of asthma. The introduction of differentially targeted biologics into clinical practice became a challenge in terms of understanding and recognizing the etiopathogenetic heterogeneity of the asthmatic inflammation, pheno/endotyping, and, consequently, to choose the right biologic for the right patient. The answers to the following three questions should lead to correct identification of the dominant pheno/endotype: Is it really (severe) asthma? Is it eosinophilic asthma? If eosinophilic, is it (predominantly) allergen-driven? The identification of the best achievable and relevant alliance between endotypes and phenotypes ("euphenotypes") should be based not only on the assessment of the actual clinical characteristics and laboratory biomarkers, but more importantly, on the evaluation of their development and changes over time. In the current paper, we present a pragmatic three-step approach to severe asthma diagnosis and management.

### Pharmacotherapy and airway remodelling in asthma? [^64e1113b]. Thorax (2003). Low credibility.

Over the last few decades attention has largely focused on airway inflammation in asthma, but more recently it has been appreciated that there are important structural airway changes which have been grouped together under the term "airway remodelling". It is only now that questions have been asked about the impact of treatment on these structural changes. This review examines the nature of these structural airway changes, the mechanisms of their generation, their potential consequences, and what is known about the ability of anti-asthma treatments to modulate these changes.

Conclusions

From a clinician's point of view, asthma symptoms can debut at any age and, accordingly, symptom history and adequate lung function tests (typically pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry) should be undertaken to confirm or refute diagnosis in patients with asthma-like symptoms. However, most patients with asthma, regardless of their age of onset, seem to have had some form of airway symptoms during childhood. Asthma inception and related pathophysiologic processes are therefore very likely to occur in the first years of life, further evidenced by recent transcriptomic and biomarker research, which shows a pre-asthmatic disease state characterized by aberrant epithelial differentiation pattern (Figure 1). These insights have profound consequences for any asthma prevention program. Herein, we have highlighted the critical pathway of early-life viral and bacterial infections in genetically vulnerable individuals to induce an abnormal airway response as key events in asthma. As such, studies evaluating whether infant RSV immunoprophylaxis and/or maternal pregnancy vaccination (and other immunomodulatory prophylactics) may reduce childhood wheezing and asthma incidence are much anticipated. In Table 2, we summarize asthma research priorities going forward.

Although it is known that some children, both during preschool years and school age, may have clinical symptom remission, whether this equates to the disappearance of underlying pathology, especially the structural airway changes, is unknown, and at present there are no interventions that can modify this long-term impact on lung health. Yet, we know that several factors influence lung health in the long run, and we should acknowledge the very clear negative health effects from tobacco smoke and nicotine products (vaping included), air pollution and other chemical exposures, social deprivation, LRTI, poor diet, and obesity. For children at high risk of chronic (severe) asthma, a multifaceted approach to reduce exacerbations and deterioration risk is enforced. Available (and coming) biologics hold some promise to have disease-modifying effects in asthma, although additional research is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn. In addition, current mechanistic and biomarker data highlight the heterogeneity of asthma and the potential dangers of treating all patients using the same treatments. Therefore, a precision-medicine approach must be implemented to optimize treatment and tailor follow-up.

### Asthma: new developments concerning immune mechanisms, diagnosis and treatment [^7101b6e2]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This brief review discusses how recent research may modify our understanding of the immunology of asthma. Consideration is given to the possible impact that these observations may have upon diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

Recent Findings

New studies indicate that current conceptions regarding the balance between Th1 and Th2 systems may need modification. The relationship between infection and the development of asthma in children has proven to be much more complex than originally suggested by the 'hygiene hypothesis'. In addition, important genetic differences have been found in the response of asthmatic patients to therapeutic agents.

Summary

Greater insight into the mechanisms responsible for asthma and the introduction of new drugs will depend in part upon the development of reliable and simple methods for detecting airway inflammation. As the immunologic aspects of asthma are dissected, we can expect that many more potential targets for treatment will be discovered, but treatment may have to be individualized for genetic differences between different individuals.

### What can we learn about asthma from studying occupational asthma? [^002493e9]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the clinical features and underlying mechanisms of occupational asthma in an attempt to glean insights into various other forms of asthma.

Data Sources

Published literature, including consensus guidelines on diagnosis and management of occupational asthma.

Study Selection

This article represents a synthesis of these data sources and the opinion of the author.

Results

Occupational asthma may be caused by a variety of mechanisms, including both IgE-dependent and non-IgE-dependent immunological processes. IgE-dependent mechanisms are responsible for reactions to all high-molecular-weight occupational antigens and to some but not all low-molecular-weight antigens. Factors in sensitization and onset include the general genetic predisposition to make IgE and the specific responsiveness of the individual to particular allergens. Once sensitized, the main factor that influences the onset of symptoms is the degree of exposure. In general, the higher the level of exposure, the more likely the sensitized person is to develop asthma.

Conclusions

Occupational asthma can be induced by a variety of agents that appear to use different mechanisms to affect the airway. Studies of the remission of occupational asthma indicate that resolution is a slow process. However, the study of occupational asthma may eventually allow us to identify treatments that will accelerate remission or induce remission in other forms of asthma.

### Asthma exacerbations. 3: pathogenesis [^01940a3a]. Thorax (2006). Low credibility.

Asthma exacerbations are an exaggerated lower airway response to an environmental exposure. Respiratory virus infection is the most common environmental exposure to cause a severe asthma exacerbation. Airway inflammation is a key part of the lower airway response in asthma exacerbation, and occurs together with airflow obstruction and increased airway responsiveness. The patterns of airway inflammation differ according to the trigger factor responsible for the exacerbation. The reasons for the exaggerated response of asthmatic airways are not completely understood, but recent studies have identified a deficient epithelial type 1 interferon response as an important susceptibility mechanism for viral infection.

### Asthma genetics and personalised medicine [^197cbcc6]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Unbiased genetic approaches, especially genome-wide association studies, have identified novel genetic targets in the pathogenesis of asthma, but so far these targets account for only a small proportion of the heritability of asthma. Recognition of the importance of disease heterogeneity, the need for improved disease phenotyping, and the fact that genes involved in the inception of asthma are likely to be different from those involved in severity widens the scope of asthma genetics. The identification of genes implicated in several causal pathways suggests that genetic scores could be used to capture the effect of genetic variations on individuals. Gene-environment interaction adds another layer of complexity, which is being successfully explored by epigenetic approaches. Pharmacogenetics is one example of how gene-environment interactions are already being taken into account in the identification of drug responders and non-responders, and patients most susceptible to adverse effects. Such applications represent one component of personalised medicine, an approach that places the individual at the centre of health care.

### Asthma: a major pediatric health issue [^f8e1ef8e]. Respiratory Research (2002). Low credibility.

The incidence, prevalence, and mortality of asthma have increased in children over the past three to four decades, although there has been some decline in the most recent decade. These trends are particularly marked and of greatest concern in preschool children. Internationally, there are huge variations among countries and continents, as demonstrated by the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood. In general, asthma rates were highest in English-speaking countries (UK, New Zealand, Australia, and North America) and some Latin American countries (Peru and Costa Rica), and lowest in South Korea, Russia, Uzbekistan, Indonesia, and Albania. There is currently no unifying hypothesis to explain these trends or any associated risk factors. Environmental factors that may lead to asthma include air pollution; genetic factors, the hygiene hypothesis, and lifestyle differences also play potentially causative roles. Asthma may develop as a result of persistent activation of the immune system alone or in combination with physiologic airway remodeling in early childhood. Further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.

### Infection-mediated asthma: etiology, mechanisms and treatment options, with focus on Chlamydia pneumoniae and macrolides [^999c9f73]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Incidence and etiology of childhood and adult onset asthma

Asthma incidence is highest in childhood and thereafter decreases and remains stable at ~1–3 new cases per 1000 per year throughout late adolescence and adulthood. In adult populations, the prevalence of active cases of childhood-onset asthma (COA) and adult-onset asthma (AOA) are approximately equal, or favor AOA. Reasons for this counterintuitive prevalence ratio include (1) the propensity for COA to remit more frequently than AOA and (2) the greater number of years of adulthood in which to accrue new cases. Of relevance to clinical management and population disease burden is the wide range of asthma severities, from mild intermittent to severe persistent; the most severe 20% of cases account for 80% of health care utilization and morbidity. Robust population-based data indicate that around half of adults with asthma remain sub-optimally controlled, even when treated with currently available anti-inflammatory medications, and ~15% of adults with active asthma are severely uncontrolled. These data indicate the need for novel therapies that are effective in the most severe and treatment-resistant cases of asthma that account for the majority of morbidity, mortality and health care utilization. The emerging evidence that a wide variety of microbes are present in the lower airway and may play a role in asthma pathogenesis suggests that manipulating the airway microbiome may be a novel approach towards this goal. Studies confirm the existence of an infectious etiology mediated by Chlamydia pneumoniae (CP) and possibly other viral, bacterial and fungal microbes. Among the various infections associated with asthma, the obligate intracellular respiratory pathogen CP is of particular interest, as it is associated with both asthma severity and treatment resistance. Although this review focuses on CP we will discuss Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) briefly under Treatment (Section V). It is possible that microbes such as CP and MP that have been implicated in recurrent wheeze and asthma etiology may serve as cofactors for viral infections, but certainly appear to act independently in asthmatic disease. The etiology of asthma remains unknown and is almost certainly multifactorial. Many "triggers" for asthma attacks are well known (e.g. allergens, viral respiratory infections, fumes, cold air, exercise) but underlying mechanisms for why some exposed individuals develop asthma while most do not remain elusive. Genetic studies have failed to locate a unique "asthma gene" and instead point towards complex multifactorial genetic and environmental factors. A currently popular paradigm, the "Hygiene Hypothesis", posits that the increased incidence of allergies (hayfever and eczema) and asthma noted in recent decades, is associated with less exposure to childhood infections and bacterial products (e.g. endotoxin). Emerging evidence supports the Hygiene Hypothesis for hayfever and eczema but not for asthma which appears instead to be related to infections throughout the life cycle. The host lung and gut microbiome as they relate to asthma are active areas of research. Yet it must be pointed out that studies of bacterial rRNA may fail to detect CP due to low copy numbers or sampling problems due to deep tissue intracellular locations for this species.

### Childhood infections and asthma: at the crossroads of the hygiene and barker hypotheses [^303a6750]. Respiratory Research (2001). Low credibility.

The hygiene hypothesis states that childhood asthma develops as a result of decreased exposure to infectious agents during infancy and early childhood. This results in the persistence of the neonatal T helper lymphocyte 2 immunophenotype, thereby predisposing the child to atopic disease. While multiple studies support the hygiene hypothesis in asthma ontogeny, the evidence remains inconclusive; multiple other environmental exposures in early childhood also alter predisposition to asthma. Moreover, the current paradigm for asthma development extends far beyond simple childhood environmental exposures to include fetal development, genetic predisposition, and interactions of the developmental state and genetics with the environment.
