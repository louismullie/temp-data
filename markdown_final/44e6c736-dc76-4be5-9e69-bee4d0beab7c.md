## Question

Treadmill balance training in older adults

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether treadmill perturbation-based balance training reduces real-world falls in community-dwelling older adults and how to interpret the evidence for clinical decision-making. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality randomized trial and its primary outcome. Then, I should verify the magnitude and statistical significance of any effect on daily-life falls. Next, I will examine secondary outcomes and sensitivity analyses, including subgroup effects. After that, I need to check the laboratory versus real-world transfer question and mechanistic explanations. Finally, I should integrate guideline perspectives and outline practical, evidence-aligned recommendations for practice and research.

> Let me first confirm the pivotal evidence base. The 2023 JAMA Network Open randomized clinical trial in 140 community-dwelling adults aged 65 and older compared four 20-minute treadmill perturbation-based balance training (PBT) sessions versus matched-duration treadmill walking over 12 months, with daily-life falls as the primary outcome; this is the most direct, adequately powered RCT to date for this question [^notfound].

> I need to verify the primary outcome result precisely. The trial found 62 falls in the PBT group versus 78 in the control group, yielding a fall rate of 0.90 vs 1.14 per person-year and a relative reduction of 22% that did not reach statistical significance (IRR 0.78, 95% CI 0.48–1.27). Thus, there was no statistically significant reduction in daily-life falls with treadmill PBT compared with treadmill walking alone [^1122PwG7] [^116QULC7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should review secondary outcomes and subgroup signals. There were no significant differences in the proportion with at least one fall, time to first fall, or injurious falls, but a prespecified sensitivity analysis suggested a larger, though still nonsignificant, benefit among participants without a prior fall history (IRR 0.55, 95% CI 0.28–1.08) versus those with prior falls (IRR 0.91, 95% CI 0.50–1.65), hinting that primary prevention populations may respond differently. I should note that these subgroup analyses are exploratory and hypothesis-generating rather than definitive [^11337xmi] [^1122PwG7].

> Next, I should review the laboratory transfer question. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of laboratory effects. The same RCT showed large, statistically significant reductions in laboratory-induced falls at post-training, 6 months, and 12 months (IRR approximately 0.20, 0.47, and 0.37, respectively), indicating robust task-specific learning that did not translate into a significant reduction in real-world falls. This discordance between laboratory performance and daily-life outcomes is a key interpretive challenge for treadmill PBT [^1122PwG7] [^116QULC7].

> I will now examine mechanistic explanations for limited real-world transfer. Let me consider task specificity: treadmill perturbations (belt accelerations/decelerations) do not fully replicate the biomechanics of overground trips caused by obstacles that require limb elevation and precise foot placement, which may limit transfer. Overground PBT has shown larger, significant reductions in daily-life falls, supporting the idea that ecological validity matters for translation to community settings [^1115zocx].

> But wait, what about dose and intensity? Could the brief protocol explain the null finding? The intervention totaled only 80 minutes across four sessions, with three sessions in the first week and a booster at 6 months; the authors acknowledge that this dose was selected based on laboratory retention data and that larger, longer programs may be needed to detect clinically meaningful reductions in daily-life falls, which aligns with broader exercise-for-falls-prevention literature emphasizing adequate volume and progression [^116QULC7] [^1156k2SV] [^112Tus3z].

> Next, I should review the broader evidence context to ensure consistency. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of stepping and perturbation interventions show substantial reductions in falls and fallers, but many high-quality trials of treadmill PBT have not demonstrated significant effects on daily-life falls, reinforcing that modality, dose, and ecological validity likely modulate effectiveness. This helps reconcile positive signals in some studies with neutral results in others [^113pUs2b] [^112xJ4J8].

> I need to ensure my interpretation aligns with guidelines. Contemporary guidelines emphasize multicomponent, progressive, and sufficiently challenging balance training delivered over at least 12 weeks and continued for maintenance. They also note that exercise reduces injurious falls and the proportion of fallers, while acknowledging heterogeneity and the need for individualized, supervised programs. None currently endorse treadmill PBT as a standalone, first-line strategy for community fall prevention [^112Tus3z] [^114nNDNt] [^116svvqM].

> Let me synthesize the clinical implications carefully. Treadmill PBT is feasible and safe with appropriate harness systems and produces large improvements in reactive balance in controlled settings, but current evidence does not support relying on brief, treadmill-based PBT alone to reduce real-world falls in community-dwelling older adults; it may be considered as an adjunct within a broader, progressive balance and strength program, particularly for primary prevention or for those who cannot access overground systems, while we await larger, longer, and more ecologically valid protocols [^116QULC7] [^112Tus3z] [^1176CxzJ].

> I should double-check practical recommendations. For clinical practice, prioritize multicomponent exercise with progressive balance challenges (e.g., sit-to-stand, stepping in multiple directions, narrowing base of support, reducing upper limb support), consider volitional or reactive step training where appropriate, and, if available, incorporate overground perturbation or adaptability training that more closely mimics real-world hazards; if treadmill PBT is used, pair it with higher-dose, longer-duration programs and consider emerging approaches like VR-augmented treadmill training that has shown reductions in falls in high-risk cohorts, while monitoring for adherence and safety [^112dEdXm] [^116iGf5u] [^113p74Q9] [^112Tus3z].

> Finally, I should confirm the research gaps and next steps. Larger RCTs with at least several hundred participants, extended intervention durations (e.g., 12 weeks or more), multidirectional and ecologically valid perturbations, head-to-head comparisons with overground methods, and stratification by fall history are needed to clarify dose, transfer, and responder characteristics. Until such data are available, treadmill PBT should not replace established, guideline-concordant balance and strength programs for community fall prevention [^112xJ4J8] [^112Tus3z] [^114nNDNt].

---

Treadmill balance training is a **task-specific, progressive intervention** that improves reactive balance and reduces laboratory falls in older adults [^116QULC7], but **does not significantly reduce real-world falls** over 12 months [^1122PwG7]. It is **safe and feasible** with a harness, with minimal adverse events, and is best used as an adjunct to multicomponent balance and strength programs [^1168nAi2] [^11337xmi] [^112rqJjJ] [^1176CxzJ]. Overground perturbation training may better transfer to daily life, and **higher-dose or multimodal protocols** are needed to improve real-world effectiveness [^1115zocx] [^1156k2SV] [^113p74Q9].

---

## Benefits of treadmill balance training

Treadmill balance training improves **reactive balance** — the ability to recover from unexpected perturbations — a key predictor of falls [^113grqTd]. It also reduces **laboratory falls** by 53–80% during and after training, indicating strong task-specific learning [^116QULC7]. Additionally, it enhances **gait stability** by improving spatiotemporal parameters and reducing variability, supporting safer walking [^117EBSmZ].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Despite laboratory gains, treadmill balance training does not significantly reduce **real-world falls** over 12 months (IRR 0.78, 95% CI 0.48–1.27) [^117BkEZ8]. Limited **transferability** may arise because treadmill perturbations (belt accelerations/decelerations) differ from real-life trips over obstacles, limiting adaptation to daily environments [^1115zocx]. Brief protocols (e.g. four 20-minute sessions) may be underdosed for durable community effects, and **higher-dose or multimodal programs** may be needed [^114zMinZ].

---

## Safety considerations

Treadmill balance training is **generally safe** when performed with a harness and supervised progression; adverse events are rare and typically minor (e.g. transient muscle soreness) [^116QULC7]. Participants should be screened for cardiovascular, neurological, and musculoskeletal conditions, and training should be individualized and supervised by trained professionals [^113AfJzN].

---

## Comparison with other balance training methods

| **Attribute** | **Treadmill balance training** | **Overground perturbation training** | **Traditional balance exercises** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Environment | Controlled, predictable | Unpredictable, real-world | Structured, predictable |
| Transferability | Limited to daily life | High | Moderate |
| Effectiveness | Improves reactive balance and laboratory falls | Reduces real-world falls (~49%) | Improves balance and reduces falls (~24%) |
| Safety | High with harness | Moderate, requires supervision | High |

---

Overground perturbation training shows **greater transfer** to daily life and larger reductions in real-world falls, whereas traditional balance exercises remain effective and widely accessible [^1115zocx] [^112Tus3z].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **multicomponent programs** that include balance, strength, and functional exercises, with progressive challenge and sufficient dose (≥ 3 sessions/week for ≥ 12 weeks) [^112Tus3z] [^113AfJzN]. Treadmill balance training is not a standalone solution; it should be integrated with strength, functional, and gait training, and tailored to individual risk, preferences, and comorbidities [^112rqJjJ] [^115QnUCK].

---

## Practical implementation

- **Assessment**: Conduct baseline balance, gait, and fall risk assessments (e.g. TUG, Berg Balance Scale, fall history) [^111VxcPq].
- **Individualization**: Adjust perturbation type, intensity, and progression to ability and goals [^112Tus3z].
- **Supervision**: Use trained staff and safety harnesses; progress gradually [^113AfJzN].
- **Integration**: Combine with strength, functional, and gait training for comprehensive fall risk reduction [^112rqJjJ].
- **Monitoring**: Track adherence, adverse events, and outcomes to guide progression [^115QnUCK].

---

## Future research directions

- **Dose-response**: Determine optimal frequency, intensity, and duration for real-world fall reduction [^1156k2SV].
- **Multimodal approaches**: Combine treadmill training with VR, dual-task, or overground elements to enhance transfer [^113p74Q9] [^112WiGa7].
- **Long-term retention**: Evaluate durability of balance gains and fall risk reduction [^117BkEZ8].
- **Special populations**: Test efficacy in frail, cognitively impaired, or neurologic populations [^1144if2B].

---

Treadmill balance training improves reactive balance and laboratory falls but **does not significantly reduce real-world falls**; it should be used as part of a **multicomponent program**, with further research on dose, modality, and transfer to daily life [^1122PwG7] [^112rqJjJ].

### The efficacy of treadmill training with and without projected visual context for improving walking ability and reducing fall incidence and fear of falling in older adults with fall-related hip fracture: a randomized controlled trial [^114gDVgG]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The ability to adjust walking to environmental context is often reduced in older adults and, partly as result of this, falls are common in this population. A treadmill with visual context projected on its belt (e.g., obstacles and targets) allows for practicing step adjustments relative to that context, while concurrently exploiting the great amount of walking practice associated with conventional treadmill training. The present study was conducted to compare the efficacy of adaptability treadmill training, conventional treadmill training and usual physical therapy in improving walking ability and reducing fear of falling and fall incidence in older adults during rehabilitation from a fall-related hip fracture.

Methods

In this parallel-group, open randomized controlled trial, seventy older adults with a recent fall-related hip fracture (83.3 ± 6.7 years, mean ± standard deviation) were recruited from inpatient rehabilitation care and block randomized to six weeks inpatient adaptability treadmill training (n = 24), conventional treadmill training (n = 23) or usual physical therapy (n = 23). Group allocation was only blind for assessors. Measures related to walking ability were assessed as the primary outcome before and after the intervention and at 4-week and 12-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes included general health, fear of falling, fall rate and proportion of fallers.

Results

Measures of general walking ability, general health and fear of falling improved significantly over time. Significant differences among the three intervention groups were only found for the Functional Ambulation Category and the dual-task effect on walking speed, which were in favor of respectively conventional treadmill training and adaptability treadmill training.

Conclusions

Overall, adaptability treadmill training, conventional treadmill training and usual physical therapy resulted in similar effects on walking ability, fear of falling and fall incidence in older adults rehabilitating from a fall-related hip fracture. Additional post hoc subgroup analyses, with stratification for pre-fracture tolerated walking distance and executive function, revealed several intervention effects in favor of adaptability and conventional treadmill training, indicating superiority over usual physical therapy for certain subgroups. Future well-powered studies are necessary to univocally identify the characteristics of individuals who will benefit most from a particular intervention.

### World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: a global initiative [^116jswr7]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendation details and justification

Older adults classified as low risk by our algorithm have an incidence of a single fall in the next year of approximately 20–30%, but the individual risk varies according to easily recognisable attributes such as vision, hearing and foot problems, but also less measurable factors such as: context (what does the individual need to do and in what environment?); behaviours (is the person cautious, impulsive, erratic?); and, transient factors such as illness, or absence of usual support. Our recommendations promote a generic primary preventative approach which can be adapted to individual circumstances and characteristics.
There is a growing body of evidence showing a relationship between physical activity and fall risk at a population level, and evidence for effective interventions on habitual physical activity and exercise programmes for older adults at low to intermediate risk for falls. While the interventions may well merit a higher grade, this recommendation on provision of advice is at Grade E, as there is insufficient evidence on how this is best provided, taking into consideration the potential risks, including falls, to habitually inactive people who embark on activities such as brisk walking.
Recommendations on types and amounts of habitual physical activity and the avoidance of being sedentary are provided by national and international guidelines, such as the World Health Organisation, the American College of Sports Medicine, and the.
The WHO and the UK Physical Activity guidelines take a life course approach and include a specific focus on functional mobility and falls, as well as considering the merits of various activities and sports. The American College of Sports Medicine provides a wide range of exercise prescriptions for various situations.
The WHO and the UK Physical Activity guidelines recommend activities which challenge balance and include resistance training twice per week. General physical activity alone (e.g. walking) is unlikely to prevent falls.
We recommend that, where possible and safe, older adults should aim to participate in 150–300 minutes per week of intermediate-intensity physical activity or 75–150 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity physical activity. There is evidence from observational studies that meeting physical activity guidelines of moderate to vigorous intensity activity reduces future falls risk and reduces the chance of an individual falling, although these findings remain uncertain. This promotion of healthy lifestyle can be expected to decrease fall risk indirectly through its positive impact on deconditioning, frailty, sarcopenia and cardiovascular health.
Uptake and adherence to exercise interventions and to increasing habitual physical activity may be helped by behaviour-change approaches such as coaching, supervision, group activity and educational material.
Generic health promotion guidelines include advice on lifestyle habits, periodic vision and hearing checks and footcare. WHO has provided guidelines on primary and community-based assessment and first level responses across five key domains which are collectively predictive of future disability.
Falls prevention advice in low risk older adults may include referral to local community health promotion or 'ageing well' programmes where available.
We recommend inclusion of fracture risk management (including need for osteoporosis treatment) to reduce fracture risk.

### Effect of treadmill perturbation-based balance training on fall rates in community-dwelling older adults: a randomized clinical trial [^114zMinZ]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

In this trial of a 4-session treadmill PBT intervention, there was not a statistically significant decrease in daily-life fall rates among community-dwelling older adults compared with those in the control group. There was, however, a significant reduction in laboratory fall rates associated with PBT.

The significant decrease in laboratory fall rates found in this study aligns with results of previous PBT studies. However, improved laboratory performance was not transferred to the daily-life falls, even though a nonsignificant 22% reduction was observed favoring the PBT group. The sample size of the current study was estimated based on an expected 50% decrease; hence, the trial was underpowered to detect a 22% between-group difference. It is noteworthy that the 22% decrease in daily-life fall rates was similar to the 23% reduction reported in a large systematic review of studies on physical exercise. In contrast to 80 minutes of total training in the PBT protocol, most studies in that systematic review applied multiple weekly sessions for 12 or more weeks. Thus, the findings of the present trial indicate that PBT is more time efficient than general exercise approaches. However, the results must be validated in larger trials with sufficient sample sizes to detect approximately 20% fall rate reductions.

### Effect of treadmill perturbation-based balance training on fall rates in community-dwelling older adults: a randomized clinical trial [^117TGA71]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

The study Treadmill balance training in older adults was published by Jens Eg Nørgaard and colleagues in 2023 in the journal JAMA Netw Open. This study is related to the following diseases: Falls in the elderly. In the Treadmill balance training in older adults study, the trial question was: what is the effect of treadmill perturbation-based balance training in community-dwelling older adults? In the Treadmill balance training in older adults study, the study design was: single center, open label, RCT. In the Treadmill balance training in older adults study, the population was: 140 patients (79 female, 61 male). The inclusion criteria were community-dwelling adults ≥ 65 years of age and were able to walk without a walking aid. The key exclusion criteria were orthopedic surgery within the past 12 months; osteoporosis or osteoporosis-related fractures; progressive neurological disease; an unstable medical condition preventing safe participation; severe cognitive impairment. In the Treadmill balance training in older adults study, the interventions were: n = 70 perturbation-based balance training (four 20-minute perturbation-based balance training sessions, with postural disturbances induced by sudden treadmill accelerations) n = 70 treadmill walking training (four 20-minute regular treadmill walking sessions at the patient's preferred walking speed). In the Treadmill balance training in older adults study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in daily-life fall rates in the past 12 months (0.9 vs. 1.14; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.27). In the Treadmill balance training in older adults study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in patients with at least 1 fall (49% vs. 57%; RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.2) No significant difference in median time to first fall (94 days vs. 123 days; HR 0.7, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.14) No significant difference in patients with at least 1 fall-related injury (24% vs. 34%; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.25). In the Treadmill balance training in older adults study, the conclusion was: in community-dwelling adults ≥ 65 years of age and were able to walk without a walking aid, perturbation-based balance training was not superior to treadmill walking training with respect to a daily-life fall rates in the past 12 months.

### Effect of treadmill perturbation-based balance training on fall rates in community-dwelling older adults: a randomized clinical trial [^1115zocx]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

While treadmill PBT did not show significant decreases in daily-life falls, overground PBT may be more effective. Pai et alshowed that overground PBT reduced the fall rate by 49% and any falls by 51%. This finding suggested that overground walkway PBT offers superior adaptation transferability to daily life compared with treadmill PBT. A possible explanation is that overground walkway perturbations more closely resemble daily-life situations than perturbations induced by treadmill accelerations. For instance, recent evidence showed that repeated trips induced by treadmill accelerations did not improve reactive balance control in a subsequent obstacle-induced trip. In daily life, trips occur by obstructing the swinging leg, demanding elevation or lowering of the leg before a large forward step is taken to regain balance. In contrast, the response following a trip from a treadmill acceleration does not necessitate such an elevation or lowering of the leg before the compensatory step is taken, leading to biomechanical differences. These differences may have resulted in suboptimal adaptation transferability. Moreover, while treadmill slip PBT has been associated with better reactive balance control following a subsequent overground slip perturbation, greater improvements and retention were found after practicing on an overground walkway. Although treadmills may be less task specific, they are less space consuming, cheaper, and easier to operate than overground setups, making them more clinically feasible. Thus, developing more task-specific treadmill perturbations (eg, obstacle-induced trips) may facilitate clinically feasible and more effective PBT.

### Strength-balance supplemented with computerized cognitive training to improve dual task gait and divided attention in older adults: a multicenter randomized-controlled trial [^117Nu75f]. BMC Geriatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The progressive and dynamic aging process is characterized by functional and cognitive changes that often lead to physical performance deficits and deteriorations in walking. These changes occur even in the absence of overt diseases. Potential consequences are increased risk for falls, loss of independence in activities of daily living, and poor quality of life. Functional dependence in older adults is associated with increased health care costs and mortality. Minimizing falls is a common concern of many interventions as a third of people aged 65 and older and half of those aged 85 and older sustain falls each year, from which 10% result in serious consequences. One key factor in staying independent and maintaining mobility is, therefore, to enhance walking ability in older adults.

The general health protecting influence of physical activity in relation to muscular, skeletal, metabolic and cardiovascular functions is well documented. The effect of physical and cognitive activity on brain functioning has also been recognized. Physical activity, for example, has been suggested reducing the incidence of dementia or cognitive deterioration, and is related to enhancements in cognitive functioning and brain plasticity. Cognitive interventions resulted in improved cognitive speed, attention, and concentration. Thus, cognitive functions are amenable both through physical and cognitive exercise, even in old age.

### Pilot comparative effectiveness study of surface perturbation treadmill training to prevent falls in older adults [^113GeunE]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Surface perturbation treadmill training (SPTT)

Treatment for the SPTT cohort included the same general protocol as for the Standard PT cohort, but with the addition of the surface perturbation treadmill training. Each treadmill training session was incorporated into standard visits at the therapist's discretion. The SPTT sessions consisted of the subject, who was in a safety harness that would catch them before hitting the machine if they fell, standing or walking at comfortable speed on the microprocessor-controlled, stepper motor-driven treadmill. The training protocol consisted of postural disturbances that simulated a trip (sudden backward motion of the treadmill belts that resulted in forward-directed rotation of the subject's torso) or a slip (sudden forward motion of the treadmill belts that resulted in backward-directed rotation of the subject's torso).

The magnitude of the disturbance for each trial is defined by four parameters: peak velocity, elapsed time to peak velocity, elapsed time during which the peak velocity is maintained, and time required to decelerate the treadmill belt to zero velocity. The magnitude of perturbation (amount and speed of sudden treadmill belt motion) was set for each trial by the therapist from level 1 (mildest) to level 5 (most vigorous) based on each patient's day-to-day and trial-to trial performance. In general, the magnitude of the disturbances during training sessions progressed from less to more challenging; however, the exact sequence was not established a priori.

### Effect of treadmill perturbation-based balance training on fall rates in community-dwelling older adults: a randomized clinical trial [^117BkEZ8]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Falling is the leading cause of injuries in older adults, and the associated costs of treatment and rehabilitation burden society substantially. Among community-dwelling older adults, most falls and fall-related injuries are caused by slips and trips. Nevertheless, some of these falls are preventable, and physical exercise is considered to be one of the most efficient preventive approaches. A promising task-specific exercise modality is perturbation-based balance training (PBT). During PBT, individuals are exposed to repeated external disturbances in a safe environment that are intended to improve reactive responses after slips and trips (an overview of the principles and mechanisms has been described elsewhere). It has been shown that just a few PBT sessions can produce substantial refinements in reactive balance control after laboratory-induced perturbations. Moreover, these adaptations can be retained for up to 12 months after training cessation. Nonetheless, the dose for optimal retention and generalization of adaptations still needs further evaluation. Additionally, the current evidence regarding the effects of PBT on daily-life falls is inconsistent, with some studies reporting a fall-reducing effect of nearly 50%, whereas other studies demonstrate no effects. Most of these trials were designed either as a pilot study or as an evaluation of other outcomes, resulting in small sample sizes (< 50 participants per group). In addition, perturbation type, dose, and intensity vary between studies, limiting the ability to make recommendations for PBT.,

The recently published world guidelines for fall prevention highlight PBT as a future research priority. Therefore, this randomized clinical trial (RCT) aimed to evaluate the effects of a 4-session treadmill PBT intervention compared with regular treadmill walking on daily-life fall rates among community-dwelling older adults.

Regarding preventative measures for falls in the elderly, more specifically with respect to exercise interventions, APTA 2025 guidelines recommend to offer exercise programs in older adults to be performed at least 150 minutes to 3 hours per week, lasting from 6–12 months, and include progressive and sufficiently challenging balance training.

### Feedback-based perturbation balance training during stationary cycling improves reactive and proactive balance among older adults: a single-blinded randomised controlled trial [^11615ai6]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Falls are the leading cause of fatal and nonfatal injuries among older adults. They reduce mobility and quality of life and increase morbidity and mortality. Reactive balance responses play a critical role in preventing falls, as many of them arise from ineffective recovery reactions following an unexpected loss of balance.

Perturbation balance training (PBT) involves exposing participants to repeated, unannounced external balance disturbances in a safe, controlled setting. The goal is to specifically activate and train balance recovery skills (e.g. reactive step, reactive trunk and arms responses) to improve stability and prevent falls. Older adults who participated in PBT programmes were found to have reduced their rate of falls by 40%–46% compared to those in control groups, whereas conventional balance exercise programmes, reduced fall incidence only by 21%–23%. Participating in PBT programmes reduces laboratory-induced frequency of reactive step responses and improves voluntary step performance, both balance-related fall risk factors. However, PBT programmes are mostly conducted using different mechatronic systems that provide external perturbations during standing or walking. Consequently, such PBTs are only suitable for older adults who can stand and walk independently on a treadmill without relying on or holding onto the treadmill's handrails. Previous research has shown that even light touch can diminish both reactive and proactive balance responses). Unfortunately, since not all older adults are able to walk without holding the treadmill handrails during standard PBT, its accessibility remains limited.

### Interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114nNDNt]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF — exercise interventions for community-dwelling older adults show that nearly all programs included gait, balance, and functional training (30/37 trials), with about two-thirds including strength and resistance training (25/37); pooled analyses found that a pooled analysis of 29 trials (n = 14 475) showed exercise interventions were associated with a significant reduction in injurious fall rate at the longest follow-up (6–24 months) (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75–0.96]), reduced the number of persons with ≥ 1 fall at the longest follow-up (6–24 months) (25 trials; n = 13 384; relative risk, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.87–0.98]) and the risk of injurious falls at 6 to 60 months (21 trials; n = 3984; IRR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.74–0.95]), while pooled analyses found no significant reductions in fall-related fractures or all-cause mortality; across reporting exercise trials, 58% of participants were at increased risk for falls.

### Functional gait rehabilitation in elderly people following a fall-related hip fracture using a treadmill with visual context: design of a randomized controlled trial [^115iNE3m]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Walking requires gait adjustments in order to walk safely in continually changing environments. Gait adaptability is reduced in older adults, and (near) falls, fall-related hip fractures and fear of falling are common in this population. Most falls occur due to inaccurate foot placement relative to environmental hazards, such as obstacles. The C-Mill is an innovative, instrumented treadmill on which visual context (e.g., obstacles) is projected. The C-Mill is well suited to train foot positioning relative to environmental properties while concurrently utilizing the high-intensity practice benefits associated with conventional treadmill training. The present protocol was designed to examine the efficacy of C-Mill gait adaptability treadmill training for improving walking ability and reducing fall incidence and fear of falling relative to conventional treadmill training and usual care. We hypothesize that C-Mill gait adaptability treadmill training and conventional treadmill training result in better walking ability than usual care due to the enhanced training intensity, with superior effects for C-Mill gait adaptability treadmill training on gait adaptability aspects of walking given the concurrent focus on practicing step adjustments.

Methods/Design

The protocol describes a parallel group, single-blind, superiority randomized controlled trial with pre-tests, post-tests, retention-tests and follow-up. Hundred-twenty-six older adults with a recent fall-related hip fracture will be recruited from inpatient rehabilitation care and allocated to six weeks of C-Mill gait adaptability treadmill training (high-intensity, adaptive stepping), conventional treadmill training (high-intensity, repetitive stepping) or usual care physical therapy using block randomization, with allocation concealment by opaque sequentially numbered envelopes. Only data collectors are blind to group allocation. Study parameters related to walking ability will be assessed as primary outcome pre-training, post-training, after 4 weeks retention and 12 months follow-up. Secondary study parameters are measures related to fall incidence, fear of falling and general health.

Discussion

The study will shed light on the relative importance of adaptive versus repetitive stepping and practice intensity for effective intervention programs directed at improving walking ability and reducing fall risk and fear of falling in older adults with a recent fall-related hip fracture, which may help reduce future fall-related health-care costs.

### Exercise for falls prevention in community-dwelling older adults: trial and participant characteristics, interventions and bias in clinical trials from a systematic review [^114icHbZ]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Conclusion

This review identified the diversity of trials that evaluate the effect of exercise on falls in community-dwelling older people, in terms of participants' age and baseline fall risk, intervention type, duration and delivery mode. Implications for clinicians include implementing balance challenging exercise programmes, of adequate duration, in a setting optimal for the patient, with strategies to promote exercise uptake. Further research is needed regarding exercise for fall prevention in low-income countries and in males. Future trials should minimise bias, comply with reporting guidelines and report factors relevant to facilitating translation to clinical practice.

### Physical therapy management of older adults with hip fracture [^113rPtcq]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2021). High credibility.

Aerobic exercise added to structured exercise — older adults after hip fracture: Aerobic training appears to be safe and may improve function among those patients who have sustained a hip fracture. In a trial including progressive resistance training, improved lower extremity strength, balance, gait speed, and functional recovery were reported after 6 months of an intensive program that included 5 to 15 minutes of stationary bike or treadmill. Aerobic training included physical activities to keep heart rate within 65% to 75% of predicted maximum for 20 minutes. Although underpowered, greater improvements in lower extremity strength were found among those who participated in aerobic exercise compared to a no-exercise group, with no significant differences in mobility measures or self-reported function.

### Physical therapy management of older adults with hip fracture [^1133NiXm]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2021). High credibility.

Treadmill training after hip fracture — van Ooijen et al and Oh et al: In inpatient rehabilitation, conventional treadmill training, adaptability treadmill training, and usual physical therapy each received a total of 30 visits; session allocations were 30 usual-therapy sessions, or 15 usual plus 15 conventional treadmill, or 15 conventional plus 15 adaptability treadmill sessions. Across 10 outcomes and 3 time points, postintervention differences favored adaptability treadmill training at 3 months following the 6-week intervention and at 4-week follow-up. Separately, an RCT adding 20 minutes of antigravity treadmill training to 30 minutes of standard physical therapy in patients with hip fracture and sarcopenia found improved walking ability and balance at 3 weeks and at 3 and 6 months.

Gait adaptability

Subjects will walk in a virtual environment on a path through a forest, with various slopes and turns. Both the incline/decline of the slopes and the sharpness of the turns will have a standardized starting level of 20% (out of 100%), which will then be progressed in steps of 5 to 15%. A difficulty level of 20% corresponds to a maximum incline/decline and rotation of 2 degrees. Each 5% increase in difficulty level means an increase in the maximum incline, decline and rotation of 0.5 degrees. For the percentage by which the difficulty level will be increased for each NRS score, see Table 3.

Static reactive balance

Subjects will stand on the CAREN while the platform and treadmill make sudden movements. The platform can shift or tilt to anterior, posterior, left and right. The treadmill belt can unilaterally accelerate from standstill. All possible perturbations have seven difficulty levels (see Tables 4, 5 and 6). Training will start at level 1 for each subject.

Dynamic reactive balance

Subjects will walk on the treadmill at their comfortable walking speed, while the above mentioned platform and treadmill perturbations are applied. The treadmill perturbations will consist of unilaterally accelerating or decelerating the treadmill belt for short periods of time, simulating a trip or a slip, respectively (Table 6).

### Treadmill training for patients with Parkinson's disease [^11141KJ8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Treadmill training is used in rehabilitation and is described as improving gait parameters of patients with Parkinson's disease.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of treadmill training in improving the gait of patients with Parkinson's disease and the acceptability and safety of this type of therapy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Movement Disorders Group Specialised Register (see Review Group details for more information) (last searched September 2014), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1950 to September 2014), and EMBASE (1980 to September 2014). We also handsearched relevant conference proceedings, searched trials and research registers, and checked reference lists (last searched September 2014). We contacted trialists, experts and researchers in the field and manufacturers of commercial devices.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing treadmill training with no treadmill training in patients with Parkinson's disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted the trialists for additional information. We analysed the results as mean differences (MDs) for continuous variables and relative risk differences (RD) for dichotomous variables.

Main Results

We included 18 trials (633 participants) in this update of this review. Treadmill training improved gait speed (MD = 0.09 m/s; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03 to 0.14; P = 0.001; I² = 24%; moderate quality of evidence), stride length (MD = 0.05 metres; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.09; P = 0.01; I² = 0%; low quality of evidence), but walking distance (MD = 48.9 metres; 95% CI -1.32 to 99.14; P = 0.06; I² = 91%; very low quality of evidence) and cadence did not improve (MD = 2.16 steps/minute; 95% CI -0.13 to 4.46; P = 0.07; I² = 28%; low quality of evidence) at the end of study. Treadmill training did not increase the risk of patients dropping out from intervention (RD = -0.02; 95% CI -0.06 to 0.02; P = 0.32; I² = 13%; moderate quality of evidence). Adverse events were not reported in included studies.

Authors' Conclusions

This update of our systematic review provides evidence from eighteen trials with moderate to low risk of bias that the use of treadmill training in patients with PD may improve clinically relevant gait parameters such as gait speed and stride length (moderate and low quality of evidence, respectively). This apparent benefit for patients is, however, not supported by all secondary variables (e.g. cadence and walking distance). Comparing physiotherapy and treadmill training against other alternatives in the treatment of gait hypokinesia such as physiotherapy without treadmill training this type of therapy seems to be more beneficial in practice without increased risk. The gain seems small to moderate clinically relevant. However, the results must be interpreted with caution because it is not known how long these improvements may last and some studies used no intervention in the control group and underlie some risk of bias. Additionally the results were heterogenous and we found variations between the trials in patient characteristics, the duration and amount of training, and types of treadmill training applied.

### Is leg-driven treadmill-based exoskeleton robot training beneficial to poststroke patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114JaLsP]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study is to systematically review the effects of leg-driven treadmill-based exoskeleton robot training on balance and walking ability in poststroke patients.

Design

The PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, Medline, CNKI, VIP, and Wanfang databases were searched from inception to August 2021. The literature quality was evaluated using Cochrane Handbook. Primary outcomes include the Functional Ambulation Category Scale and Berg Balance Scale, and secondary outcomes include the 10 meter walk test, 6 minute walk test, and gait assessment cadence were analyzed.

Results

Seventeen randomized controlled trials were included in the systematic review, 15 studies in meta-analysis. Primary outcomes showed no significant difference in the Functional Ambulation Category Scale score; subgroup with the exoskeleton robot + conventional therapy of the Berg Balance Scale score was significantly increased; secondary outcomes showed no significance in 6 minute walk test or 10 meter walk test. The cadence score increased for the subgroup with an onset of more than 6 mos in the treatment group. The control group performed better than the subgroup with an onset of less than 6 mos.

Conclusions

Leg-driven treadmill-based exoskeleton robot training can improve balance function in poststroke patients and is beneficial for patients with an onset of greater than 6 mos. However, there is no evidence to support the efficacy of walking ability.

### Unexpected perturbations training improves balance control and voluntary stepping times in older adults-a double blind randomized control trial [^117EBSmZ]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Participation in a balance training program that includes unexpected perturbation of balance during treadmill walking reduced the risk factors for falls as presented by biomechanical markers that have been shown in the past to identify fallers and predict falls. However levels of physical functioning were not improved, this suggests that preventing sedentary lifestyle for the elderly require additional behavioral intervention.

### Effect of treadmill perturbation-based balance training on fall rates in community-dwelling older adults: a randomized clinical trial [^112xJ4J8]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Of the 4 RCTs with a primary aim of investigating the effects of PBT on daily-life falls, 3 used treadmill PBT and 1 used an overground walkway. These 3 RCTs found no beneficial effects on daily-life fall rates (IRR, 0.93–1.19), and 2 of these trials included only 1 type of perturbation (either slips or trips), diminishing the transferability of these interventions since unidirectional perturbations are not associated with improved reactive balance control after perturbations in other directions. However, 1 RCT investigated adding multidirectional treadmill PBT to usual balance training but showed no effects on daily-life fall rates (IRR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.98–1.24). Its participants were categorized as having a high risk of falling, 70% of whom had experienced a fall in the preceding year. However, it has been shown that older adults with a history of falls may be less responsive to PBT than participants without a previous fall. In this trial, the sensitivity analysis found larger effects among participants without falls (IRR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.28–1.08) than participants with a previous fall (IRR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.50–1.65), suggesting that PBT may be most effective in primary prevention. However, the results join the current evidence, which has not yet demonstrated that treadmill PBT can prevent daily-life falls among community-dwelling older adults.

### Effects of different exercise modalities on balance performance in healthy older adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115Q6T9W]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The global phenomenon of population aging is becoming increasingly significant, with the proportion of older adults expected to rise from 11 to 22% between 2000 and 2050. As age increases, older adults experience gradual declines in balance performance, muscle strength, and other physical functions, with more pronounced effects after the age of 60. This decline not only impacts daily living abilities but also directly leads to a decrease in balance, significantly increasing the risk of falls among older adults. Among those aged 65 and older, approximately 30–40% experience falls each year, and half of these falls result in injury. Falls among older adults not only increase the burden on social healthcare systems and medical costs, but also restrict the mobility. To prevent further falls, older adults often reduce their daily activities, which in turn leads to a sedentary lifestyle, further may ultimately heighten the likehood of future falls. Therefore, improving balance performance in older adults is crucial not only for fall prevention but also improves overall quality of life.

The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and the American Heart Association (AHA) recommend that older adults at risk of falling should regularly engage in balance training, as improving balance can help reduce the risk of falls. Howe et al. and Sun et al. suggest that regular exercise can enhance muscle strength, improve gait, and enhance balance performance in older adults. Hunter et al. found that older adults who engage in low-intensity high-velocity resistance training at least once a week can increase muscle mass and strength, thereby reducing the difficulty of daily activities and work. Naczk et al. further supported this view, showing that after six weeks of resistance training, older adults experienced significant improvements in upper and lower limb strength and balance performance. A meta-analysis indicated that balance in older adults can be effectively improved through various forms of exercise, including resistance training, aerobic exercise, balance training, and activities such as T-Bow and balance board training.

### Pilot comparative effectiveness study of surface perturbation treadmill training to prevent falls in older adults [^116i58b3]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Another notable feature is that the average fall-risk scores in both treatment groups went from above the "at-risk" threshold levels at enrollment to below these levels at the end of treatment. This indicates that PT goals were met in both the intervention and control groups; this is not unexpected as the therapists involved were experienced in gait/balance training. This finding does underscore, however, that the improvements in fall outcomes being evaluated were over and above those found from a robust, standard of care intervention.

One major limitation of this study was that, as a pilot, it was not adequately powered to detect important changes in fall outcomes. A sample size calculation done for planning a larger more definitive trial showed that with a baseline fall risk in the control population of 33%, similar to what we found in this pilot, to obtain 80% power with a type one error rate of 0.05, 106 subjects would be needed to detect a 50% reduction in fall risk, 320 to detect a 30% reduction in fall risk, and 750 to detect a 20% reduction in fall risk. Thus a definitive study would need to be designed for between 500 and 1000 subjects.

### Unexpected perturbations training improves balance control and voluntary stepping times in older adults-a double blind randomized control trial [^112AQnks]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

It is still unknown how the improvement seen in balance and stepping carries over to real-life falls. It may be that carryover to fear of falls and physical performance as measure with POMA did exist but was not detected by these outcomes measures due to insufficient sample size or due to ceiling effects, subjects were close to score the highest score in both measures. We also did not find significant carryover effects on self-reported and performance based function. This suggests that function is not derived only by the ability to perform balance tasks, but is influenced by environmental and behavioral factors. Most perturbation training programs did not measure self-reported physical function. However other studies found improvement in self-reported function and fear of falls. This two studies trained balance in a group setting adding also behavioral factors. This may suggest that physical intervention per-se without behavioral intervention cannot change the levels of physical function. The fact that Performance based measure are weakly associated with self-reported mobility in healthy elderly persons (r = 0.21–0.29) support this notion.

This study has several limitations. First, the data came from a fairly small sample of independent older adults thus the results cannot be generalized to frail or institutionalized elderly persons. Second, the training program was done on a treadmill and not on leveled ground. Treadmill walking is somewhat different then over ground walking and might pose different demands on the trainee. However, it has been showed that fall-resisting skills acquired from such training can be transferred to over-ground walking. Third, to provide stronger evidence of the clinical efficacy of this training procedure, future studies should compare the current intervention with an alternative treatment such as Tai Chi, or strength training as this was found beneficial in a recent review. Also there is a need to determine whether this type of training improves the ability to cope with falls that resulted from slips and trips only, or can be transferred to any kind of loss of balance. Fourth, further research is needed in order to determine whether randomly ordered perturbations exercises (Random practice) would render better results than repeating the same perturbation exercises (blocked practice) in terms of acquisition, adaptation and retention.

### Unexpected perturbations training improves balance control and voluntary stepping times in older adults-a double blind randomized control trial [^1132A9rh]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Falls are common among elderly, most of them occur while slipping or tripping during walking. We aimed to explore whether a training program that incorporates unexpected loss of balance during walking able to improve risk factors for falls.

Methods

In a double-blind randomized controlled trial 53 community dwelling older adults (age 80.1 ± 5.6 years), were recruited and randomly allocated to an intervention group (n = 27) or a control group (n = 26). The intervention group received 24 training sessions over 3 months that included unexpected perturbation of balance exercises during treadmill walking. The control group performed treadmill walking with no perturbations. The primary outcome measures were the voluntary step execution times, traditional postural sway parameters and Stabilogram-Diffusion Analysis. The secondary outcome measures were the fall efficacy Scale (FES), self-reported late life function (LLFDI), and Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA).

Results

Compared to control, participation in intervention program that includes unexpected loss of balance during walking led to faster Voluntary Step Execution Times under single (p = 0.002; effect size [ES] = 0.75) and dual task (p = 0.003; [ES] = 0.89) conditions; intervention group subjects showed improvement in Short-term Effective diffusion coefficients in the mediolateral direction of the Stabilogram-Diffusion Analysis under eyes closed conditions (p = 0.012, [ES] = 0.92). Compared to control there were no significant changes in FES, LLFDI, and POMA.

Conclusions

An intervention program that includes unexpected loss of balance during walking can improve voluntary stepping times and balance control, both previously reported as risk factors for falls. This however, did not transferred to a change self-reported function and FES.

### Does dual task training improve walking performance of older adults with concern of falling? [^114VqUxV]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Older adults with concerns of falling show decrements of gait stability under single (ST) and dual task (DT) conditions. To compare the effects of a DT training integrating task managing strategies for independent living older adults with and without concern about falling (CoF) to a non-training control group on walking performance under ST and DT conditions.

Methods

Single center parallel group single blind randomized controlled trial with group-based interventions (DT-managing balance training) compared to a control group (Ninety-five independent living older adults; 71.5 ± 5.2 years). A progressive DT training (12 sessions; 60 min each; 12 weeks) including task-managing strategies was compared to a non-training control group.

Setting

group based intervention for independent living elderly in a gym. ST and DT walking (visual verbal Stroop task) were measured on a treadmill. Gait parameters (step length, step width, and gait line) and cognitive performance while walking were compared with a 2x2x2 Repeated Measures Analyses of Variance.

Results

Participants in the intervention group showed an increased step length under ST and DT conditions following the intervention, for both people with and without CoF compared to their respective control groups. Foot rolling movement and cognitive performance while walking however only improved in participants without CoF.

Conclusions

The results showed that DT managing training can improve walking performance under ST and DT conditions in people with and without CoF. Additional treatment to directly address CoF, such as cognitive behavioural therapy, should be considered to further improve the cautious gait pattern (as evidenced by reduced foot rolling movements).

Trial Registration

The study was retrospectively registered in the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS; Identification number DRKS00012382, 11.05.2017).

### Perturbation-based balance training targeting both slip-and trip-induced falls among older adults: a randomized controlled trial [^113grqTd]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Falls are the leading cause of injuries among adults age 65 and older United States. In 2014, for example, 29 million falls were reported among older adults, resulting in 7 million injuries and costing $50 billion. Moreover, the number of annual falls among older adults continues to grow at a rate that is faster than the growth rate of the older adult population. These statistics, despite years of effort toward fall prevention, highlight the need for more effective methods to reduce falls.

Perturbation-based balance training (PBT) is a promising new approach to fall prevention that involves training the neuromuscular response to postural perturbations. PBT, when tailored to mimic common fall scenarios such as slipping or tripping, is a form of task-specific training that leverages motor learning principles by allowing participants to practice reactive responses in a safe, controlled setting. Slips commonly occur at heel strike when the friction required for walking exceeds the friction available between the foot and floor, and typically result in a backwards loss of balance. Examples of PBT for slipping have involved repeated exposure to slips while walking over a sliding platform, or a structured step-training regimen onto a low-friction surface. These types of PBT have elicited slip-reducing proactive gait adaptations, and improved recovery rates and reactive balance after laboratory-induced slips. Trips commonly occur when an obstruction impedes the forward motion of the swing leg during gait, and typically result in a forward loss of balance. Examples of PBT for tripping have involved repeated exposure to trips while walking over ground, using a cable system to impede forward foot motion while walking on a treadmill, or simulated trips while standing on a specialized treadmill. These types of PBT have elicited improved kinematics and fall rates after laboratory-induced trips, and reduced trip-induced falls outside of the laboratory.

### Perturbation-based balance training to improve balance control and reduce falls in older adults-study protocol for a randomized controlled trial [^114Ksk2e]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Training setup

Training will take place on the CAREN system at the MUMC+ department of physical therapy. The CAREN is a dual-belt treadmill system embedded in a motion platform with 6 degrees of freedom and surrounded by a 180 degree screen. The treadmill and the motion platform can both provide reactive balance challenges separately or combined, providing a wide array of possible types and directions of perturbation. Virtual reality environments are projected onto the screen to make the training activities more immersive. Subjects will wear a safety harness at all times during training to protect them from injuries in case of an unsuccessful balance recovery.

Training dose

Based on previous studies, we hypothesize that three training sessions of 30 min each will be enough to facilitate adaptation of reactive balance control.

### Exercise for improving balance in older people [^114dW4f3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

In older adults, diminished balance is associated with reduced physical functioning and an increased risk of falling. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2007.

Objectives

To examine the effects of exercise interventions on balance in older people, aged 60 and over, living in the community or in institutional care.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 1), MEDLINE and EMBASE (to February 2011).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled studies testing the effects of exercise interventions on balance in older people. The primary outcomes of the review were clinical measures of balance.

Data Collection and Analysis

Pairs of review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data from studies. Data were pooled where appropriate.

Main Results

This update included 94 studies (62 new) with 9,917 participants. Most participants were women living in their own home. Most trials were judged at unclear risk of selection bias, generally reflecting inadequate reporting of the randomisation methods, but at high risk of performance bias relating to lack of participant blinding, which is largely unavoidable for these trials. Most studies only reported outcome up to the end of the exercise programme. There were eight categories of exercise programmes. These are listed below together with primary measures of balance for which there was some evidence of a statistically significant effect at the end of the exercise programme. Some trials tested more than one type of exercise. Crucially, the evidence for each outcome was generally from only a few of the trials for each exercise category. 1. Gait, balance, co-ordination and functional tasks (19 studies of which 10 provided primary outcome data): Timed Up & Go test (mean difference (MD) -0.82 s; 95% CI -1.56 to -0.08 s, 114 participants, 4 studies); walking speed (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.43; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.75, 156 participants, 4 studies), and the Berg Balance Scale (MD 3.48 points; 95% CI 2.01 to 4.95 points, 145 participants, 4 studies).2. Strengthening exercise (including resistance or power training) (21 studies of which 11 provided primary outcome data): Timed Up & Go Test (MD -4.30 s; 95% CI -7.60 to -1.00 s, 71 participants, 3 studies); standing on one leg for as long as possible with eyes closed (MD 1.64 s; 95% CI 0.97 to 2.31 s, 120 participants, 3 studies); and walking speed (SMD 0.25; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.46, 375 participants, 8 studies).3. 3D (3 dimensional) exercise (including Tai Chi, qi gong, dance, yoga) (15 studies of which seven provided primary outcome data): Timed Up & Go Test (MD -1.30 s; 95% CI -2.40 to -0.20 s, 44 participants, 1 study); standing on one leg for as long as possible with eyes open (MD 9.60 s; 95% CI 6.64 to 12.56 s, 47 participants, 1 study), and with eyes closed (MD 2.21 s; 95% CI 0.69 to 3.73 s, 48 participants, 1 study); and the Berg Balance Scale (MD 1.06 points; 95% CI 0.37 to 1.76 points, 150 participants, 2 studies).4. General physical activity (walking) (seven studies of which five provided primary outcome data). 5. General physical activity (cycling) (one study which provided data for walking speed). 6. Computerised balance training using visual feedback (two studies, neither of which provided primary outcome data). 7. Vibration platform used as intervention (three studies of which one provided primary outcome data).8. Multiple exercise types (combinations of the above) (43 studies of which 29 provided data for one or more primary outcomes): Timed Up & Go Test (MD -1.63 s; 95% CI -2.28 to -0.98 s, 635 participants, 12 studies); standing on one leg for as long as possible with eyes open (MD 5.03 s; 95% CI 1.19 to 8.87 s, 545 participants, 9 studies), and with eyes closed ((MD 1.60 s; 95% CI -0.01 to 3.20 s, 176 participants, 2 studies); walking speed (SMD 0.04; 95% CI -0.10 to 0.17, 818 participants, 15 studies); and the Berg Balance Scale ((MD 1.84 points; 95% CI 0.71 to 2.97 points, 80 participants, 2 studies). Few adverse events were reported but most studies did not monitor or report adverse events. In general, the more effective programmes ran three times a week for three months and involved dynamic exercise in standing.

Authors' Conclusions

There is weak evidence that some types of exercise (gait, balance, co-ordination and functional tasks; strengthening exercise; 3D exercise and multiple exercise types) are moderately effective, immediately post intervention, in improving clinical balance outcomes in older people. Such interventions are probably safe. There is either no or insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions for general physical activity (walking or cycling) and exercise involving computerised balance programmes or vibration plates. Further high methodological quality research using core outcome measures and adequate surveillance is required.

### Functional gait rehabilitation in elderly people following a fall-related hip fracture using a treadmill with visual context: design of a randomized controlled trial [^1161FDh9]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Figure 1
C-Mill. The C-Mill is a 3-m long instrumented treadmill with visual objects such as stepping targets and obstacles projected on the belt to facilitate practice of foot placement relative to environmental context. A force platform is embedded in the treadmill for real-time determination of gait and foot-placement positions, allowing for various gait adaptability interventions accustomed to an individual's gait. The visual context is projected on the belt's surface, approaching the patient with the speed of the treadmill belt. The handrails permit weight-bearing and allow early training in a safe environment.

This study protocol is designed to examine the efficacy of C-Mill gait adaptability training for improving walking ability and reducing fall incidence and fear of falling in older adults residing in inpatient rehabilitation care to recover from a fall-related hip fracture, a group particularly prone to falling. The efficacy of C-Mill gait adaptability training will not only be contrasted against usual care, comprising of exercises in strength, balance, overground walking, transfers and activities of daily living, but also against intensity matched conventional treadmill training (i.e. without visual context presented on the belt), promoting repetitive stepping. Literature on conventional treadmill training in older adults recovering from hip injury is quite scarce, but generally positive with regard to its efficacy. Conventional treadmill training outperforms overground gait training in that regard, most likely because of the enhanced intensity of training (i.e. defined in number of steps taken per training session). Older adults with a total hip arthroplasty, for example, performed 1000–1500 steps during a conventional treadmill training session compared to 100–150 steps during an overground gait training session of similar duration. We therefore hypothesize that both conventional treadmill training and C-Mill gait adaptability treadmill training result in better outcomes related to walking ability than usual care due to the enhanced training intensity, with superior effects for C-Mill gait adaptability treadmill training on gait adaptability aspects of walking given the concurrent focus on practicing gait adaptability. The present study will thus shed light on the relative importance of high versus low practice intensity and adaptive versus repetitive stepping as key ingredients for effective intervention programs aimed at improving walking ability and reducing fall risk and fear of falling in older adults recovering from a fall-related hip fracture.

### Feedback-based perturbation balance training during stationary cycling improves reactive and proactive balance among older adults: a single-blinded randomised controlled trial [^114DouU8]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Thus, in contrast to conventional PBT methods that elicit reactive balance responses during treadmill walking, we aimed to expose older adults to perturbations while seated and cycling on stationary bicycles without holding the handrails. This approach specifically targets trunk and arm reactive responses, with the goal of improving standing balance reactions. It may offer a more accessible alternative for older adults who are unable to walk independently on treadmill-based perturbation systems without relying on handrails. Even well-respected studies on balance training in older adults appear to have either ignored or misunderstood the concept of specificity of training. For example, the study of fall prevention performed training only in sitting, assuming that effects would directly transfer to standing. Due to the lack of specificity in this model, it is not very surprising that no effects of the intervention were found. However, it is important to note that the ability to limit trunk motion has consistently distinguished successful balance recovery from laboratory-induced falls. The lower trunk flexion angle and trunk velocity have been associated with successful balance recovery after underfoot perturbations and following a trip during overground walking. Several studies reported that trunk reactions are highly involved in controlling reactive fixed base-of-support (BoS) strategies as well as in stepping reactions following different methods of anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) perturbations. Smaller trunk movement (e.g. flexion and side flexion angles) at foot contact following unexpected balance perturbations in walking and in standing is a strong predictor of successful recovery by a single-step reaction to AP and ML perturbation. Moreover, the trunk angle at foot contact is also reported to be one of the principal mechanisms by which balance recovery is adapted by repeated exposure to balance perturbations. Additionally, older adults who participated in PBT programmes exhibited a significant reduction in their maximum trunk angle during balance recovery. Also, when compared to well-established active Tai Chi controls, the maximum trunk angle was smaller and a reactive balance rating was higher among PBT participants only.

### Effect of treadmill perturbation-based balance training on fall rates in community-dwelling older adults: a randomized clinical trial [^1156k2SV]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Limitations

This trial has several limitations. First, participants were unblinded to group randomization due to the nature of training interventions. Given that the initial fall reporting was a participant-reported outcome, the lack of blinding may have contributed to fewer falls reported in the PBT group. However, daily-life falls were collected according to the recommendations of the Prevention of Falls Network Europe. Second, there was no established dose-response association between PBT and daily-life falls. Thus, the applied intensity and dose of the PBT were selected based on previous studies showing the sustained effectiveness of PBT in laboratory falls. Still, generalization to daily life may require higher training doses or intensity. Third, due to practical limitations, laboratory falls were evaluated by visual inspection of video recordings instead of the weight supported by the safety harness. However, the assessor was blinded to group randomization, reducing this limitation's potential bias. Fourth, participants were assembled from convenience sampling and included healthy older adults; thus, the results do not generalize to frail individuals with a higher risk of fall-related injuries.

### Barefoot walking is more stable in the gait of balance recovery in older adults [^114KjKxz]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Our study is not without limitations. Firstly, our findings may only be generalizable to a non-habitually barefoot older population. The different foot-strike patterns of habitual barefoot and non-habitual barefoot may lead to differences in the spatiotemporal parameters of gait. However, this seems to be of only minor importance for the question of whether training is better with shoes or without. In the present experimental design, all participants wore well-fitting neutral running shoes. A monolithic form of footwear was compared to walking barefoot, which may limit the applicability of the findings to diverse footwear. Gait variability was reduced when walking in minimalist shoes compared to walking barefoot, with equivalent age group effects. Moreover, different footwear has differential sole thickness and hardness, which may affect the balance of older adults. Future studies will be necessary to include multifunctional footwear or socks-only versus barefoot conditions depending on the specific study population, such as patients with foot injuries or gait abnormalities, to differentiate the applicability of footwear condition for perturbation-based balance training on a treadmill. Secondly, the number of first recovery steps after perturbation included in the study was relatively small. However, to date, the number of steps/strides required to reach reliability of gait variability is still under exploration. Moreover, the number of steps required varies for different indicators of spatiotemporal parameter variability, ranging from less than six to more than several hundred steps. It has been revealed that a single familiarization trial can significantly improve the reliability of gait variability in older adults, which could take as little as 6 min on the treadmill. Last but not least, "our experimental design was to apply perturbation-based balance training to simulate the likelihood of a fall occurring" does not seem to hold, as no falls were observed. Further studies on trip perturbations leading to falls are needed to confirm our findings.

### Pilot comparative effectiveness study of surface perturbation treadmill training to prevent falls in older adults [^117XASMM]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

This pilot comparative effectiveness study found that surface perturbation treadmill training (SPTT) could be incorporated into a multi-faceted fall prevention therapy program without an increase in the number of sessions or the average length of each session. The randomized comparison between the two PT interventions was well accepted by patients with 88% of eligible subjects willing to enroll. Standard measures of fall risk were reduced equally in the two groups, suggesting no decrement in the effect of standard PT due to substitution of some of the therapy time by SPTT. Risk of falls was reduced by a substantial amount in the SPTT group; however, these differences were not significant in this underpowered pilot study. The potential that these findings might be maintained in a larger population merits further research into the effectiveness of fall prevention therapy incorporating SPTT. The fact that the 4 patients who did not complete the study were all in the SPTT group raises the possibility that a subset of patients may find this technology intimidating which will need to be considered in planning future studies.

The findings in our study are generally consistent with the limited prior work assessing SPTT. One small study in patients with Parkinson's disease (n = 18) demonstrated a 50% reduction in falls in the two weeks following an 8-week, 24 session treadmill-based perturbation training program. This study was limited in scope but demonstrated the capability of task-specific training to reduce the actual incidence of falls in a target population. Additionally, research has demonstrated that the motor learning skills acquired on the treadmill are transferred to actual tripping situations over ground in the laboratory.

Perhaps the most intriguing finding in this study was the substantial difference in the number of patients who had a fall or injurious fall despite the similarities in the fall risk measures between groups. While this may be due to chance, given that the study was not powered to detect differences in fall rates between the two groups, the apparent discrepancy is consistent with the mechanism of the intervention. SPTT is task specific training meant to improve the response to a trip or slip and improve the chance of recovery. These tasks are not tested in any of the standard fall-risk measures such as the TUG or the BERG; thus, the finding that their specific fall risks may have improved more than their apparent overall balance and gait performance is intriguing but needs to be investigated further in an adequately powered study.

### Pilot comparative effectiveness study of surface perturbation treadmill training to prevent falls in older adults [^11224GeZ]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Preliminary findings of this pilot study show promise that a PT intervention inclusive of surface perturbation treadmill training (SPTT) may be useful within a multidimensional approach for lowering fall risk. This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of incorporating SPTT into clinical practice and the ability to randomize a reasonable proportion of eligible patients. In addition, the effect size for reducing fall and injurious falls appears to merit consideration of longer-term studies involving larger and more diverse patient populations to assess this promising addition to balance training in older adults.

### Is power training or conventional resistance training better for function in elderly persons? A meta-analysis [^112kQMSh]. Age and Ageing (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

to determine the effects of power training with high movement velocity compared with conventional resistance training with low movement velocity for older community-dwelling people.

Design

systematic review of randomised controlled trials.

Data Sources

the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled TRIALS, PubMed (Medline), EMBASE, CINAHL, PEDro and Scholar-Google.

Trials

all randomised or quasi-randomised trials investigating power training with high movement velocity versus conventional resistance training with low movement velocity in elderly persons over the age of 60 years. The primary outcomes were measures of functional outcomes; secondary outcomes were balance, gait, strength, power, muscle volume and adverse effects.

Results

eleven trials were identified involving 377 subjects. The pooled effect size for the follow-up values of the functional outcomes was 0.32 in favour of the power training (95% CI 0.06 to 0.57) and 0.38 (95% CI -0.51 to 1.28) for the change value. The pooled effect from three studies for self-reported function was 0.16 in favour of power training (95% CI -0.17 to 0.49).

Conclusion

power training is feasible for elderly persons and has a small advantage over strength training for functional outcomes. No firm conclusion can be made for safety.

### Exercise for falls prevention in aged care: systematic review and trial endpoint meta-analyses [^1144if2B]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

World Health Organisation guidelines recommend all older adults undertake physical activity for falls prevention and a range of other health benefits, including reduced mortality, improved cardiovascular health, mental and cognitive health and sleep. In community-dwelling older adults, there is high certainty evidence that exercise reduces falls and that balance and functional exercises plus resistance training, and possibly Tai Chi, successfully prevent falls. The consequences of falls have a significant impact on the quality of life and health of older people and contribute major costs to the health system, including for falls occurring in residential care.

However, the most recent Cochrane Collaboration review update for falls prevention in residential aged care settings concluded that the effectiveness of exercise as a single intervention to reduce the rate of falls is unclear, and there may be little or no effect on the risk of falling. The high heterogeneity between trial findings was not explained by predefined subgroup analyses on provision of exercise type or level of care. Nevertheless, some of the trials reduced falls and newer trials have been published since. Other recent meta-analyses have had both similar and conflicting findings, thus the value of exercise for falls prevention in residential aged care remains uncertain.

Exercise needs to be maintained for ongoing effects on muscle strength and fitness. In both highly trained athletes, and older adults discharged from hospital, deconditioning occurs when training ceases. However, previous meta-analyses examining the effectiveness of providing exercise training programs for older people living in residential aged care settings have not examined falls outcomes according to the timing of recording outcomes in relation to delivery of the programme.

The current study therefore used systematic review and meta-analysis to address the research question 'What is the effectiveness of exercise as a single falls prevention intervention to reduce the rate or risk of falls in older people living in residential aged care

as measured at the end of an intervention period or
following a period of post-intervention follow-up?'

### Pilot comparative effectiveness study of surface perturbation treadmill training to prevent falls in older adults [^117PnqXS]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Falls are the leading cause of fatal and non-fatal injuries and represent a major cause of functional limitation and disability among older adults. Each year in the United States an estimated 1/3 of older adults fall. In 2005, 15,802 patients aged 65 and older died as the result of fall-related injuries. The direct medical costs for fall-related injuries was estimated to be $19 billion in 2000 and the burden of fall-related injuries is expected to grow such that by the year 2020, the total cost is estimated to become approximately $54.9 billion. External perturbations such as tripping (an unexpected deceleration of the foot causing imbalance) and slipping (an unexpected acceleration of the foot causing imbalance) are a major contributor to falls. In one study of 780 fall-related hip fractures, it was found that as many as 47% were the result of a trip. In a prospective study reporting the circumstances and consequences of falls for 96 older adults, 34% of the falls resulted from a trip.

Modifiable risk factors for falls include muscle weakness, gait and balance problems, poor vision, use of psychoactive medications, and reduction in home hazards. Most effective fall-prevention interventions focus on exercise, either alone or as part of a multi-faceted program. Use of current CDC guidelines has been shown to reduce falls by as much as 37% in a healthy older adult population. Although exercise appears to have efficacy in reducing falls, the optimal type, frequency, and duration of exercise remains unclear.

Recently, dynamic stability (the ability to maintain balance following a postural perturbation) has emerged as a potentially important aspect of defining and modifying fall risk. Older adults can, with appropriate training, quickly adapt to a large postural perturbation by changing the biomechanics of their recovery. Several researchers have focused on task-specific adaptive training (practicing the actual motor skill of a defined task such as avoiding a fall after loss of balance) with the goal of retraining the body's inherent neuromuscular protection mechanisms to prevent a fall following a postural perturbation. There is evidence that this type of training reduces the risk of falling following simulated trips and slips and that this training can be retained over a period of months.

### Summary of the updated American Geriatrics Society / British Geriatrics Society clinical practice guideline for prevention of falls in older persons [^1161ybar]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2011). Medium credibility.

Customized exercise program — implementation and cautions: Because evidence supports that exercise in the form of resistance (strength) training and balance, gait, and coordination training is effective in reducing falls, the panel concluded that such exercise should be included as part of a multifactorial or multicomponent intervention and may be considered as a single intervention. In most positive trials, programs were at least 12 weeks (1–3 times per week) with variable intensity. Exercise programs should be initiated with caution because some studies have shown that exercise may increase the rate of falls in persons with limited mobility who are not accustomed to physical activity. Trials that included balance training as part of the intervention showed significant reduction in falls and other benefits.

Regarding preventative measures for falls in the elderly, more specifically with respect to exercise interventions, WFG 2022 guidelines recommend to offer individualized exercise programs including balance challenging and functional exercises (such as sit-to-stand, stepping) with sessions ≥ 3 times weekly, progressed in intensity for at least 12 weeks and continued longer for greater effect, for fall prevention in community-dwelling older adults.

### Effect of treadmill perturbation-based balance training on fall rates in community-dwelling older adults: a randomized clinical trial [^1168nAi2]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Perturbation-Based Balance Training (Intervention)

Each of the 4 PBT sessions lasted approximately 20 minutes and consisted of 40 perturbations (20 to each leg) delivered on a uniformly moving treadmill with no lateral rails (Split 70/157/ASK; Woodway). A safety harness prevented participants from falling to the ground if they could not regain balance after a perturbation. Participants experienced only slips in the first session, only trips in the second session, and randomly ordered slips and trips (mixed perturbations) in the third and fourth sessions (Figure 2 A). The side (right or left leg) and timing (intervals of 10 to 50 steps between) of the perturbations were randomized to increase unpredictability. The slip perturbations were induced by a quick forward acceleration at heel strike (0% of the gait cycle), causing a reversal in the treadmill movement direction (Figure 2 B). The trip perturbations were induced by a sudden deacceleration followed by a greater backward acceleration at midswing (approximately 80% of the gait cycle) (Figure 2 C).

The perturbation intensity was adjusted based on participants' preferred walking speed and was divided into 5 levels with progressively longer durations (slip) or greater accelerations (trip). The intensity was increased after every fourth perturbation if (1) the combined rating of perceived anxiety and difficulty was 4 or less, (2) the participant avoided falling during the previous 4 perturbations, and (3) the participant was comfortable increasing the intensity. However, if any criterion was not met, the intensity remained unchanged (for protocol tailoring, see eAppendix 1 in Supplement 2).

Treadmill Walking Training (Control)

In each of the 4 treadmill walking training sessions, the control participants performed 20 minutes of treadmill walking at their preferred walking speed. The duration of these walks matched the PBT group's time on the treadmill.

### Effect of treadmill and overground walking on function and attitudes in older adults [^116m85Z1]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to determine whether treadmill walking, as a mode of physical activity for older adults, was comparable with overground walking when considering 1) spatiotemporal gait characteristics (walking velocity, stride length, and stride rate) at a preferred velocity and a prescribed intensity typical of many exercise prescriptions (i.e. RPE of 13); and 2) the effects on physical function (short physical performance battery (SPPB), lateral mobility, 400-m walk) and participants' attitude towards training and level of enjoyment.

Methods

Gait characteristics were measured at each participant's preferred and RPE 13 velocity during treadmill and overground walking (N = 23, 74 ± 4 yr). Participants were then randomized to either a treadmill or overground progressive intensity and duration walking program of 18 sessions.

Results

Both the preferred and RPE 13 walking velocities were significantly slower on the treadmill compared with overground (t(22) = -10.87, P < 0.001 and t(22) = -8.54, P < 0.001, respectively), as a result of significantly shorter stride lengths and slower stride rates. After training, there were no differences between the groups for RPE 13 velocity, SPPB or lateral mobility. However, following the intervention, the overground group completed the 400-m walk faster (F(1,15) = 6.06, P < 0.05), had a more favorable attitude towards training, and expressed a more favorable level of enjoyment about the training program than the treadmill group (F(1,16) = 7.5; P < 0.05).

Conclusion

An overground walking program appears to offer some advantages over a treadmill walking program in older adults. Using RPE alone to regulate intensity may reduce the benefits of a treadmill walking program in older adults.

### Effect of treadmill perturbation-based balance training on fall rates in community-dwelling older adults: a randomized clinical trial [^11337xmi]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Sensitivity Analyses

The Poisson regression with bootstrapping yielded results that were comparable to those of the negative binomial regression for all count outcomes (eAppendix 3 in Supplement 2). Moreover, both preregistered sensitivity analyses yielded no difference in results in daily-life fall outcomes and primary analyses (eTables 4 and 5 in Supplement 2). The analysis of participants with a history of falls showed similar fall rates between the PBT (n = 28) and control (n = 29) groups (IRR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.50–1.65). However, 45% fewer falls (IRR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.28–1.08) were registered in the PBT group (n = 42) compared with the control group (n = 41) among participants without a history of falling (eTable 6 in Supplement 2). Multiple imputations of the laboratory fall outcomes did not significantly change the estimates (eAppendix 4 in Supplement 2).

Safety

No serious adverse events were reported in the present RCT. Nevertheless, 2 injuries occurred during PBT: a knee injury and a muscle strain in the thigh. The participant with the knee injury had 1 appointment with the general practitioner, but none of the injuries required any further health care treatment. An overview of the adverse events is available in eTable 7 in Supplement 2.

### Step training improves reaction time, gait and balance and reduces falls in older people: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113pUs2b]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the effects of stepping interventions on fall risk factors and fall incidence in older people.

Data Source

Electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane, CENTRAL) and reference lists of included articles from inception to March 2015.

Study Selection

Randomised (RCT) or clinical controlled trials (CCT) of volitional and reactive stepping interventions that included older (minimum age 60) people providing data on falls or fall risk factors.

Results

Meta-analyses of seven RCTs (n = 660) showed that the stepping interventions significantly reduced the rate of falls (rate ratio = 0.48, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.65, p < 0.0001, I² = 0%) and the proportion of fallers (risk ratio = 0.51, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.68, p < 0.0001, I² = 0%). Subgroup analyses stratified by reactive and volitional stepping interventions revealed a similar efficacy for rate of falls and proportion of fallers. A meta-analysis of two RCTs (n = 62) showed that stepping interventions significantly reduced laboratory-induced falls, and meta-analysis findings of up to five RCTs and CCTs (n = 36–416) revealed that stepping interventions significantly improved simple and choice stepping reaction time, single leg stance, timed up and go performance (p < 0.05), but not measures of strength.

Conclusions

The findings indicate that both reactive and volitional stepping interventions reduce falls among older adults by approximately 50%. This clinically significant reduction may be due to improvements in reaction time, gait, balance and balance recovery but not in strength. Further high-quality studies aimed at maximising the effectiveness and feasibility of stepping interventions are required.

### What type, or combination of exercise can improve preferred gait speed in older adults? A meta-analysis [^111yDUR5]. BMC Geriatrics (2015). Low credibility.

In addition, another two reviews performed a small meta-analysis on the effect of exercise on gait speed in frail older populations. Chou et al. showed a significant increase in gait speed of 0.07 m/s compared with a control group (95% CI, 0.02–0.11; p = 0.005), and the results of Giné-Garriga et al. show a preferred gait speed that was 0.06 m/s higher than in the control group (95% CI, 0.04–0.08; P < .001). However, the included studies of Chou et al. use different paces (fast or preferred gait speed) in the gait speed tests, what could have influenced the mean gait speed performance. In both studies, the exercise interventions that are compared are very heterogeneous; varying from stretching to interdisciplinary interventions with a physiotherapy component. Finally, there is limited information regarding whether improvement in gait speed can be maintained after exercise interventions had ended, because of limited long term data on maintenance of gait speed from randomized controlled trials and reviews. More knowledge is needed on the course of gait speed over time, and what is needed to maintain the benefits from training.

In summary, improving gait speed in older adults is important, however there are inconsistent findings in clinical trials regarding effects of exercise on gait speed, and there is much heterogeneity in gait speed tests and interventions in the current reviews and meta-analyses. Strength training or a combination of strength- with aerobic training seems promising, and there are many more modalities investigated like balance-, functional-, and flexibility training. However, we only have limited time to effectively exercise with this target population. Therefore, it is important to learn if we should focus on strength training alone, or also invest time in another type of exercise modality that contributes to the results. We emphasize the need for a large updated meta-analysis. The main objective of this study was to determine the meta-effects of different types or combinations of exercise interventions from randomized controlled trials on improvement in preferred gait speed. We hypothesize that progressive resistance training has significant effect on preferred gait speed. Furthermore, a combination with balance, or endurance training may enhance this effect.

### World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: a global initiative [^113AfJzN]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendation details and justification

The first recommendation applies to all older adults regardless of their assessed risk of falling or age. We recommend programmes that include balance and functional exercises (e.g. sit-to-stand, stepping): GRADE: 1A, programmes that include multicomponent exercise (i.e. multiple types of exercise), most commonly balance and functional exercises with strength exercise: GRADE: 1B, and Tai Chi: GRADE: 1B.
Exercise programmes that need to be of sufficient intensity and duration should be delivered in a way that ensures safety and considers functional abilities.
Exercise programmes should be delivered by appropriately trained professionals who can adapt exercises appropriately to functional status and co-morbidities. These professionals could be physiotherapists, exercise physiologists or kinesiologists, trained exercise instructors or other allied health professionals. We acknowledge that this will be difficult in some settings but note that the vast majority of interventions found to be effective in trials used trained providers.
Exercise needs to be progressive initially and maintained once a plateau is reached.
Benefits of exercise are lost on cessation so opportunities to continue with appropriate activity at the end of the programme are important. If individuals withdraw due to concurrent health issues or caring duties, they should be encouraged to return and programmes should be modified to ensure that the difficulty level and dose are appropriate.
Exercise programmes can be delivered in a group or taught and supported as an individualised home exercise programme or a mix of both in order to achieve an effective dose.
Group exercise, individualised home exercise or a combination of both may lead to better exercise programme adherence. In people with more severe cognitive impairment, smaller group or individual supervision may be necessary.
Higher supervision levels or smaller group numbers are recommended for those at higher risk of a fall including those who are frail.
An important aspect to consider is avoiding 'long-lies' and harm from being unable to get up from the floor. One in 8 older adults who fall report lying on the floor for more than 1 hour and in those over the age of 90, up to 80% cannot rise from the floor after a fall. Lying on the floor for more than an hour is associated with dehydration, electrolyte disturbance, renal failure, hypothermia, pneumonia and urinary tract infections, skin damage and pain, and declines in mobility and restrictions in activity, probably due to fear of a repeat fall. 'Lift and assist' call outs should trigger falls prevention interventions. Pendent or wrist alarms, telehealth falls detectors, cord alarms or mobile telephones are also important in enabling people to call for help if they cannot get up if they live alone (see section on technology). However, the oldest old often still lie on the floor for a long time before they use a call alarm so it is important to help them regain this skill if they have had a previous long-lie.
Regaining the skill to rise from the floor is most successfully re-learnt through practice of each of the specific movements required (often called backward-chaining) where the last step in the chain is taught first. Some falls prevention exercise programmes also have a specific focus on this skill and have shown success in regaining this function.

### Effects of different exercise modalities on balance performance in healthy older adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1116p4RC]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Exercise has been proven to significantly enhance balance performance in healthy older adults, particularly those living independently in community settings. However, it remains unclear which specific types of exercise are the most effective and which modality yields the best intervention outcomes. We aimed to evaluate the effects of different exercise modalities on four balance-related outcomes — Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), gait speed (GS), and one-leg stance with eyes open (OLSEO) — in healthy older adults, using a systematic review and network meta-analysis.

Methods

We searched five databases: Web of Science (WOS), EMBASE, EBSCO, Cochrane Library, and PubMed, with a search cutoff date of March 25, 2024. The search was restricted to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English that investigated the impact of exercise interventions on balance in healthy older adults. Quality was assessed using the PEDro scale, and both traditional and network meta-analyses were performed using Stata 15.1. Surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) values were calculated to rank the intervention effects of different exercise modalities.

Results

A total of 93 articles comprising 103 studies with 5,114 participants were included. Overall, the methodological quality of the included studies was relatively high. Pairwise meta-analysis revealed that exercise significantly improved BBS, TUG, OLSEO, and GS (p < 0.05). The network meta-analysis showed that, for improving BBS, augmented reality-based training (AR), aquatic exercise, balance training (BT), comprehensive training (CT), Exergame, functional training, and Otago were significantly more effective than the control group. For improving GS, four exercise modalities — dual-task balance and gait training, balance and gait training, mind-body interventions (MBIs), and CT — were significantly more effective than the control group. For improving OLSEO, dance, Nintendo's Wii Fit Game (Will Fit), and Otago were significantly more effective than the control group. For improving TUG, AR, BT, CT, MBIs, Will Fit, Otago, and resistance training (RT) were significantly more effective than the control group. According to the SUCRA rankings, Exergame was the most effective for improving BBS (SUCRA = 96.3%); CT was the most effective for improving GS (SUCRA = 85.8%); Otago was the most effective for improving OLSEO (SUCRA = 86.8%); and Will Fit was the most effective for reducing TUG test time (SUCRA = 88.5%).

Conclusion

This study confirms that exercise improves balance in healthy older adults. Traditional exercise like BT, MBIs, CT, and Otago are recommended, while newer approaches like Exergame, AR, and Will Fit can be cautiously considered.

### Unexpected perturbations training improves balance control and voluntary stepping times in older adults-a double blind randomized control trial [^115rYRcJ]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

A number of studies have begun to examine the effect of perturbation training on balance of older adults. Shimada et al. found improvement in mobility and a trend to fall reduction after split treadmill training. This training method is a very unnatural condition, given that most people walk with the same velocity in each leg. Other studies have other issues. Pai et al. showed a rapid decrease in loss of balance in response to multiple presentations of a slip perturbation after rising from sit to stand. Mansfield et al found that older adults with a history of falls or instability reduced the frequency of multi-step reactions and foot collisions after perturbation training while standing or walking in place. The training methods perturb the balance of their participants from sit to stand or during standing or walking in place, which may not be as relevant in a natural setting as might be a perturbation while walking. Melzer and Oddsson found improvement in voluntary stepping, and balance control, in an exercises program that incorporate mild external balance perturbation exercises applied by the instructors; and Halvarsson et al. found that old fallers that suffered from fear of falling, decreased their fear of falling, and voluntary stepping times during dual-task performance and increased velocity of walking post perturbation training. However, in these program the perturbations of posture were expected, and not random. Recently it was showed that unidirectional translational treadmill training (i.e. a laboratory-induced trip) reduced falls. Bhatt et al. found that inducing unannounced right-leg slips, participants significantly reduced fall and balance loss incidence. Pai, et al. found that a single session of repeated-slip exposure reduced older adults' annual risk of falls from 34 to 15% (p < 0.05) especially among those who had history of falls. The above protocol provided an anterior perturbation, causing a backwards "slip" initiated always by on the right foot. Participants might have learned and expected the right-leg slips perturbations. In a recent meta-analysis that include 8 perturbation-based balance training studies (n = 404) participants reported fewer falls than those in the control groups.

### Barefoot walking is more stable in the gait of balance recovery in older adults [^114R1oBB]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Perturbation-based balance training on a treadmill is an emerging method of gait stability training with a characteristic task nature that has had positive and sustained effects on balance recovery strategies and fall reduction. Little is known about the effects produced by shod and barefoot walking. We aimed to investigate which is more appropriate, shod or barefoot walking, for perturbation-based balance training in older adults.

Methods

Fourteen healthy older adults (age: 68.29 ± 3.41 years; body height: 1.76 ± 0.10 m; body mass: 81.14 ± 14.52 kg) performed normal and trip-like perturbed walking trials, shod and barefoot, on a treadmill of the Gait Real-time Analysis Interactive Lab. The marker trajectories data were processed by Human Body Model software embedded in the Gait Offline Analysis Tool. The outcomes of stride length variability, stride time variability, step width variability, and swing time variability were computed and statistically analyzed by a two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) based on gait pattern (normal gait versus perturbed recovery gait) and footwear condition (shod versus barefoot).

Results

Footwear condition effect (p = 0.0310) and gait pattern by footwear condition interaction effect (p = 0.0055) were only observed in swing time variability. Gait pattern effects were detected in all four outcomes of gait variability.

Conclusions

Swing time variability, independent of gait speed, could be a valid indicator to differentiate between footwear conditions. The lower swing time variability in perturbed recovery gait suggests that barefoot walking may be superior to shod walking for perturbation-based balance training in older adults.

### The efficacy of treadmill training with and without projected visual context for improving walking ability and reducing fall incidence and fear of falling in older adults with fall-related hip fracture: a randomized controlled trial [^112G2ekM]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

The present study showed that measures of walking ability, fear of falling and general health improved over time in all groups, which is consistent with previous studies showing improved walking ability after exercise programs in older adults with hip fracture. Overall, similar improvements were observed for adaptability treadmill training, conventional treadmill training and usual physical therapy. Significant group differences were only found for the Functional Ambulation Category and the dual-task effect on walking speed.

Functional Ambulation Category scores improved significantly more from baseline to post-intervention assessments after conventional treadmill training than after usual physical therapy and adaptability treadmill training. The non-significantly lower baseline Functional Ambulation Category scores in the group receiving conventional treadmill training might have contributed to this intervention effect. More interestingly, a task-specific intervention effect on the dual-task effect on walking speed was found in favor of adaptability treadmill training. Previous intervention studies on adaptive walking or stepping, combining aspects of motor and cognitive practice, also showed reductions in dual-task effects for both simple and adaptive walking, while dual-task effects remained unchanged after resistance training and Tai Chi training, for example. Improvements in the dual-task effects on walking thus appear highly specific to the performed intervention, which should preferably combine aspects of motor and cognitive practice such as with adaptability treadmill training. This is especially important for the participants included in the present study, who showed reduced physical functioning as well as reduced cognitive and executive functioning (see Table 2). Interestingly, cognitive dual tasks constitute an important aspect of the construct of walking adaptability.

The present study further revealed clinically relevant reductions in fall rate and the proportion of fallers after adaptability and conventional treadmill training relative to usual physical therapy (37% - 49% reduction). Although these reductions in fall rate and the proportion of fallers did not reach significance, presumably due to a not sufficiently high sample size, they match fairly well with previous research showing a 46% reduction in fall rate after an overground walking adaptability program in older adults as well as with a recent review showing that stepping interventions in response to environmental challenges reduced fall rate by 52% and the proportion of fallers by 49%. These encouraging results notwithstanding, we found no compelling evidence that conventional or adaptability treadmill training is more effective in improving walking ability and in reducing fear of falling and fall incidence than usual physical therapy after hip fracture in older adults. Several possible reasons for this null effect are discussed below.

### What type, or combination of exercise can improve preferred gait speed in older adults? A meta-analysis [^116PQdqd]. BMC Geriatrics (2015). Low credibility.

After applying our search string, there were also articles retrieved with study populations that included older adults of 60 years and older. We decided to include these three articles, because the mean age, and/or baseline gait speed within this articles were no outliers in relation to the data from other included studies. Furthermore, although research populations with specific pathologies were excluded, there is still heterogeneity within research populations of older adults. However, only for the sub-analysis C (progressive resistance-, balance- and endurance training) a significant difference was found for baseline gait speed. The study populations that performed better at post-interventions had higher baseline gait speeds. This could indicate that this type of interventions have more effect on healthier, fitter older adults.

Overall, more studies are needed with comparable interventions to enlarge the body of knowledge on effective exercise modalities, or combinations improving preferred gait speed, and preserving preferred gait speed after the interventions. Furthermore, the influence of variables like group size, instructor, instructions and exercise environment could be important to assess within RCT's that investigate the effect of specific exercise interventions in older populations. Another important behavioural aspect is how to involve older adults in (preventive) exercise training, how to keep them motivated during the training, and how to inspire them to keep active after the exercise program.

Follow up data is lacking for examining the long term effects of exercise interventions on preferred gait speed. Only four studies collected data as follow up to the post-intervention measurements. Those results are promising; gain in preferred gait speed was maintained three, six, and 12 months after the interventions were completed. However, only 2 out of 4 studies performed intention to treat analysis.

### Effect of treadmill perturbation-based balance training on fall rates in community-dwelling older adults: a randomized clinical trial [^116tXN6e]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Results

Enrollment and Adherence

Of the 199 individuals screened for eligibility, 140 were included (mean [SD] age, 72 [5] years; 79 females [56%] and 61 males [44%]) and randomized to either the PBT or control group (Figure 1). Fifty-seven participants (41%) had a fall in the past 12 months before study enrollment. The baseline characteristics of the participants were comparable between groups (Table 1).

Table 1.
Baseline Characteristics of Participants

Abbreviation: PBT, perturbation-based balance training.

The PBT group completed 90% and the control group completed 93% of the assigned training sessions. At least 75% (per-protocol criterion) of the training sessions were completed by 90% of the PBT group and 97% of the control group.

At 12 months, the PBT group had returned 99% (71.5 person-years) and the control group had returned 97% (70.4 person-years) of fall calendars. Nineteen participants (27%) in the PBT group and 25 participants (36%) in the control group had missing laboratory fall data. Data were treated as missing at random because the reasons for missing data and the demographic characteristics of participants with missing data were similar between the 2 groups (eTables 1 and 2 in Supplement 2).

### The effect of perturbation-based balance training on balance control and fear of falling in older adults: a single-blind randomised controlled trial [^113RZReh]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Interventions

Participants were randomised to receive PBT as an add-on to usual care versus usual care alone.

Usual care

Usual care consisted of physiotherapy referral by the medical doctor if indicated. As in usual clinical practice, it was ultimately up to the patient to decide whether or not to visit the physiotherapist. Both the content and duration of the physiotherapy treatment could vary based on the needs of each individual patient, and were decided by the medical specialist and physiotherapist in consultation with the patient. During study visits, the outcome assessor routinely monitored if and how often each participant had visited their physiotherapist, and what components (i.e. strength training, mobility exercises, balance exercises) were included in the physiotherapy treatment.

Perturbation-based balance training

Participants referred to the experimental group received usual care as described above, and three 30-minute sessions of PBT additionally. The PBT sessions were given once a week for three consecutive weeks using the Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment (CAREN, MOTEK Medical BV). The CAREN is a dual-belt treadmill embedded in a motion platform with 6 degrees of freedom. The treadmill and motion platform can both provide unexpected balance perturbations, such as unilateral treadmill belt accelerations or decelerations, and platform translations and rotations in various directions. This is combined with a 180-degree screen on which a virtual reality environment is projected to make training more immersive. Participants wear a safety harness during training sessions, preventing the knees from hitting the ground in case of an unsuccessful balance recovery.

### The effect of perturbation-based balance training on balance control and fear of falling in older adults: a single-blind randomised controlled trial [^115BTEGs]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Perturbation-based balance training (PBT) is an emerging intervention shown to improve balance recovery responses and reduce falls in everyday life in older adults. However, perturbation interventions were heterogeneous in nature and need improvement. This study aims to investigate the effects of a PBT protocol that was designed to address previously identified challenges of PBT, in addition to usual care, on balance control and fear of falling in older adults at increased risk of falling.

Methods

Community-dwelling older adults (age ≥ 65 years) who visited the hospital outpatient clinic due to a fall incident were included. Participants received PBT in addition to usual care (referral to a physiotherapist) versus usual care alone. PBT consisted of three 30-minute sessions in three weeks. Unilateral treadmill belt accelerations and decelerations and platform perturbations (shifts and tilts) were applied during standing and walking on the Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment (CAREN, Motek Medical BV). This dual-belt treadmill embedded in a motion platform with 6 degrees of freedom is surrounded by a 180° screen on which virtual reality environments are projected. Duration and contents of the training were standardised, while training progression was individualised. Fear of falling (FES-I) and balance control (Mini-BESTest) were assessed at baseline and one week post-intervention. Primary analysis compared changes in outcome measures between groups using Mann-Whitney U tests.

Results

Eighty-two participants were included (PBT group n = 39), with a median age of 73 years (IQR 8 years). Median Mini-BESTest scores did not clinically relevantly improve and were not significantly different between groups post-intervention (p = 0.87). FES-I scores did not change in either group.

Conclusions

Participation in a PBT program including multiple perturbation types and directions did not lead to different effects than usual care on clinical measures of balance control or fear of falling in community-dwelling older adults with a recent history of falls. More research is needed to explore how to modulate PBT training dose, and which clinical outcomes are most suitable to measure training effects on balance control.

### Taking balance training for older adults one step further: the rationale for and a description of a proven balance training programme [^116KfBcx]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To give the rationale and evidence for and a detailed description of a rehabilitation programme of proven effectiveness in improving balance in older adults.

Background Theory and Evidence

Based on the knowledge that balance loss usually occurs in situations when attention is divided, especially when being older, and that balance control relies on the interaction of several physiological systems, we have developed a specific and progressive balance training programme with dual- and multi-task exercises for older adults.

Practical Application

Balance demanding exercises, specific to the various components of balance control and to situations in daily life, were performed in sitting, standing and walking at three different levels of progression (basic, moderate and advanced) of increasing difficulty and complexity. The training was performed in 45-minutes group sessions, with 6–10 participants in each group, three times per week during 12 weeks, with two or three physiotherapists present.

Conclusions

This balance training programme strengthens self-efficacy in balance control leading to improved fall-related self-efficacy, reduced fear of falling, increased walking speed, and improved physical function. Participants found the programme motivating, valuable, fun, and enjoyable, which was reflected in a high attendance rate.

### Effect of treadmill perturbation-based balance training on fall rates in community-dwelling older adults: a randomized clinical trial [^116QULC7]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Falls are common and the leading cause of injuries among older adults, but falls may be attenuated by the promising and time-efficient intervention called perturbation-based balance training (PBT).

Objective

To evaluate the effects of a 4-session treadmill PBT intervention compared with regular treadmill walking on daily-life fall rates among community-dwelling older adults.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This 12-month, assessor-blinded randomized clinical trial was conducted from March 2021 through December 2022 in Aalborg University in Denmark. Participants were community-dwelling adults 65 years or older and were able to walk without a walking aid. Participants were randomized to either PBT (intervention group) or treadmill walking (control group). Data analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle.

Interventions

Participants who were randomized to the intervention group underwent four 20-minute sessions of PBT, including 40 slip, trip, or mixed slip and trip perturbations. Participants who were randomized to the control group performed four 20-minute sessions of treadmill walking at their preferred speed. The 3 initial training sessions were completed within the first week, whereas the fourth session was performed after 6 months.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcome was the daily-life fall rates that were collected from fall calendars for the 12 months after the third training session. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of participants with at least 1 fall and recurrent falls, time to first fall, fall-related fractures, fall-related injuries, fall-related health care contacts, and daily-life slip and trip falls.

Results

A total of 140 highly functioning, community-dwelling older adults (mean [SD] age, 72 [5] years; 79 females [56%]), 57 (41%) of whom had a fall in the past 12 months, were included in this trial. Perturbation training had no significant effect on daily-life fall rate (incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 0.78; 95% CI, 0.48–1.27) or other fall-related metrics. However, there was a significant reduction in laboratory fall rates at the posttraining assessment (IRR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.10–0.41), 6-month follow-up (IRR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.26–0.86), and 12-month follow-up (IRR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.19–0.72).

Conclusions and Relevance

Results of this trial showed that participants who received an 80-minute PBT intervention experienced a statistically nonsignificant 22% reduction in daily-life fall rates. There was no significant effect on other daily-life fall-related metrics; however, a statistically significant decrease in falls was found in the laboratory setting.

### Pilot comparative effectiveness study of surface perturbation treadmill training to prevent falls in older adults [^114fxoXu]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

The DGI (Dynamic Gait Index) assesses an individual's ability to adapt gait to different tasks. There are eight different tasks, each scored on a four-point ordinal scale ranging from 0–3, where "0" indicates the lowest level of function and "3" the highest level of function; 24 is the highest possible score. A score of 19 or less is considered to be predictive of falls in older adults.

The Berg (Berg Balance Scale) consists of 14 balance items, each scored on a five point ordinal scale ranging from 0–4, where "0" indicates an inability to perform the task and "4" represents normal performance; 56 is the highest possible score. A Berg score of less than or equal to 45 is considered to be predictive of falls in older adults.

The ABC (Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale) measures the participant's self-assessed confidence in being able to perform 16 specific activities without losing balance or becoming unsteady. For each task (i.e. walking around the house, sweeping the floor, or walking outside on an icy sidewalk) the participant indicates their level of confidence in performing the activity on a scale from 0%-100%. A higher score indicates greater confidence and higher functioning. A score of less than 67% classifies older adults as "at risk" of falling.

Data analysis

We compared the demographics and baseline fall risks in the two treatment groups to evaluate the success of randomization in generating equivalent groups. The number of treatment sessions and mean session duration between treatment groups were compared using 2-sample t-tests. Chi-square tests were used to evaluate differences in falls and injurious falls between treatment groups. Given the short time frame and full follow-up of patients completing treatment, we used the proportion of subjects with any fall or any injurious fall in our analysis rather than the more complex negative binomial regression model recommended for longer-term studies with loss to follow-up. Fall risk assessment scores (TUG, DGI, Berg and ABC) are continuous measures and their changes across time were evaluated within a linear mixed effects model. The Relative Risk of falls between the two groups controlling for baseline fall risk assessment scores was also assessed using generalized linear mixed models (PROC GLIMMIX). All analyses were conducted using SAS® version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) in the Windows XP® Professional environment.

### Pilot comparative effectiveness study of surface perturbation treadmill training to prevent falls in older adults [^112dHMX5]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Main measures

Feasibility for a larger randomized trial was assessed based on 2 major parameters: the ability to incorporate the SPTT into routine clinical practice and acceptance of study participation by eligible patients. To this end, the number of treatment sessions and session length in each group were evaluated through review of medical records. Medical records were available for 25/26 of the SPTT and 26/33 of the Standard PT subjects.

Two questions from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were asked to assess for falls: "The next question asks about a recent fall. By a fall, we mean when a person unintentionally comes to rest on the ground or another lower level. In the past 3 months have you fallen?" Those who reported a fall were asked a second question, "How many of these falls caused an injury? By an injury, we mean the fall caused you to limit your regular activities for at least a day or to go see a doctor". We assessed the proportion of patients in each group with any fall and the proportion with any injurious fall via phone interview at 3 months after enrollment. The early part of the assessment period thus was inclusive of the intervention, which began at the time of enrollment. Thus, differences in fall outcomes between the groups could represent differences in effectiveness for preventing falls or more rapid attainment of similar effectiveness.

Additional measures consisted of four standard instruments that assess different aspects of fall risk: 1) the Timed Up and Go (TUG); 2) the Dynamic Gait Index (DGI); 3) the Berg Balance Scale (Berg); and 4) the Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale (ABC). These tests were administered prior to enrollment and were repeated at time of discharge from PT.

The TUG (Timed Up and Go) is a clinician-administered test in which patients are timed (in seconds) for the following scenario: stand up from a chair, walk 3 meters, turn around, walk back and sit down. A longer time to complete the TUG indicates a lower level of functional mobility. A score of 13.5 seconds or greater indicates a fall risk in older adults.

### The efficacy of treadmill training with and without projected visual context for improving walking ability and reducing fall incidence and fear of falling in older adults with fall-related hip fracture: a randomized controlled trial [^117Hy5iy]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Falls are common in older adults and may have major consequences. Safe walking requires the ability to make step adjustments in response to environmental demands, an ability that is reduced in older adults. Falls occur most commonly during walking and environmental hazards contribute to approximately half of all falls. Interventions that incorporate overground walking adaptability exercises have shown improved obstacle avoidance performance and reduced fall incidence in older adults. In line with these findings, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis showed that falls in older adults can be reduced by about 50% after stepping training in response to environmental challenges. Practicing the complex and hazardous situations of everyday walking is therefore important to prevent falls, but older adults have little opportunity to do so consistently and safely in a task-specific manner.

The C-Mill (Motekforce Link, Amsterdam/Culemborg, The Netherlands) is an instrumented treadmill for practicing step adjustments during walking. Visual context (e.g. obstacles and targets) is projected on the belt's surface to elicit task-specific step adjustments during walking (Fig. 1), mimicking the step adjustments required for safe community ambulation in a cluttered environment. Previous research has revealed promising results of this type of training in persons with neurological impairment, in the form of improved balance, walking and obstacle avoidance performance. In addition, this improved obstacle avoidance was found to be associated with reduced attentional demands of adaptive walking.

Fig. 1
Adaptability treadmill training. The instrumented treadmill with visual context presented on the belt's surface using a projector. The handrail and an emergency stop allow for a safe practice environment (a). The walking adaptability exercises include visually guided stepping to a sequence of regular or irregular stepping targets (b), obstacle avoidance (c), speeding up and slowing down by following a moving walking zone (d) and interactive walking adaptability games (e)

Van Ooijen et al. recently found that adaptability treadmill training was well received and tolerated by older adults recovering from a fall-related hip fracture. Moreover, adaptability treadmill training and conventional treadmill training led to greater amounts of walking practice than usual physical therapy in older adults with fall-related hip fracture. Although the amount of practice is generally regarded as an important factor for effective rehabilitation, it has not been examined to date whether the use of a treadmill results in better walking ability and reduced fall incidence in older adults.

Randomization and Interventions

After the pretraining assessments, participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the PBT (intervention) group or control group (Figure 1). A permuted block randomization sequence was generated in Stata (StataCorp LLC) and uploaded in REDCap, version 9.5.6 (Vanderbilt University) by a research member who was not involved in any training or testing activities. Allocation sequence concealment was ensured by a random block size of 2, 4, 6, or 8.

Figure 1.
Participant Flowchart

PBT indicates perturbation-based balance training.

All participants in the PBT group were assigned to four 20-minute PBT sessions, and participants in the control group were assigned to 4 treadmill walking training sessions; the initial 2 training sessions were performed on the same day immediately after the pretraining assessments. A week later, the third training session was completed, whereas the fourth was conducted after 6 months (Figure 2 A). The training sessions of the intervention and control groups were conducted in the same laboratory setting. Before the first session began, participants' preferred treadmill walking speeds were determined by increasing and decreasing the belt speed to establish the upper and lower limits for comfortable walking. The preferred walking speed was then defined as the mean of the upper and lower boundaries.eAppendix 1 in Supplement 2 provides a detailed description of the training interventions.

Figure 2.
Training Schedule

The figure illustrates the arrangement of the training sessions (A). During slip perturbations (B), the participant walked at their preferred walking speed when a sudden acceleration reversed the direction of the belt movement before the belt returned to the preferred walking speed. During trip perturbations (C), the participant walked at their preferred walking speed when a sudden small deceleration followed by a larger backward acceleration occurred before the belt returned to the preferred walking speed. Positive belt speed values (B and C) indicate the belt movement direction during regular walking. PBT indicates perturbation-based balance training; TW, treadmill walking; TWT, treadmill walking training.

### Effects of different exercise modalities on balance performance in healthy older adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111VxcPq]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Analysis of the effects of exercise interventions on TUG in healthy older adults

The American and British Geriatrics Societies recommend the use of the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test to assess gait and balance in older adults. The results of this study show that exercise interventions significantly improved TUG scores in healthy older adults [SMD = −0.62,95% CI (−0.82; −0.42)], indicating a moderate effect. According to the SUCRA rankings, AE demonstrated the greatest improvement in TUG scores, followed by flexibility training, with the BGT also showing relatively higher effectiveness.

Bhuyan and Kumar found that both the experimental group, which received Swiss ball training, and the control group, which received strength training, showed significant improvements pre- and post-intervention, but there were no significant differences between the groups. Kyrdalen et al. further supported the effectiveness of Otago training in improving TUG performance, with significant improvements observed in the experimental group after 12 weeks. However, Binns and Taylor found inconsistent results, where after six months of Otago training, the experimental group did not show significant differences in the TUG test compared to the control group. The authors suggested that this could be due to the high level of physical activity maintained by participants in their daily lives, which might have diminished the intervention's effect. Similar findings were reported in Beling and Roller's study, where no significant differences were found between the experimental group that underwent 12 weeks of balance training and the control group, or even within the experimental group before and after the intervention (p > 0.05).

Although some individual studies, such as Campelo et al. found significant improvements in TUG performance after 6 weeks of Will Fit training (p < 0.05), our network meta-analysis ranks Will Fit as the lowest among all evaluated interventions for TUG (SUCRA = 8.9). A systematic review suggested that compared to traditional exercises, exergames or Will Fit are more competitive and interactive, which can motivate older adults to engage more actively in the exercises and thus enhance their effectiveness. However, it is noteworthy that only Exergames achieved a moderate SUCRA score (73.5, ranked 5th) in our analysis. These findings indicate that despite their motivational appeal, current pooled evidence indicates their overall impact on TUG performance remains limited. As Campelo et al. recommend generalizing these findings cautiously to the entire older population, and future research should further explore the applicability of such interventions.

### Perturbation-based balance training to improve balance control and reduce falls in older adults-study protocol for a randomized controlled trial [^116no7tM]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Perturbation types

From the available literature, we concluded that incorporating multiple perturbation types and directions might be of most benefit. Each training session will therefore incorporate platform (translations and tilts in the forward, backward, left and right direction) and treadmill perturbations (unilateral treadmill belt accelerations and decelerations) during standing and walking. Each perturbation type has seven increasing difficulty levels (Tables 4, 5 and 6). For each subject, the first training session will be started with perturbations of each type on level 1. Difficulty levels will then be increased based on individual training progression and NRS scores.

Training procedures

The first training session on the CAREN system will start with a period of familiarization, where the subject can get used to the system by walking on the treadmill. Subjects will report an NRS score for how comfortable they feel walking on the CAREN before and during familiarization (0; very uncomfortable to 10; fully comfortable). If a score of 7 or higher is reached, familiarization is complete. We expect that this will occur within 6–7 min.

After this, each subjects' comfortable walking speed will be determined using a ramped protocol; the walking speed will start at 0.5 m/s and will gradually be increased until the subject says 'stop' when they think their comfortable walking speed is reached. The subject will walk at this speed for approximately 1 min to check if any adjustments need to be made.

The consecutive sessions will start with a warming-up during which the subject will walk on the treadmill for approximately 3 min on a level surface and readjust to the system. Each training session will consist of three parts: gait adaptability, static reactive balance, and dynamic reactive balance. Training difficulty can be progressed by increasing the perturbation magnitude and walking speed. During the second and final training sessions, cognitive and motor dual tasks can also be added to increase training difficulty. Training adherence will be monitored throughout the study, and subjects will be encouraged to reschedule any missed training sessions.

### Perturbation-based gait training to improve daily life gait stability in older adults at risk of falling: protocol for the REACT randomized controlled trial [^112WiGa7]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Whereas most studies on perturbation training have shown positive effects on stability and gait performance in clinical or laboratory settings, translation of these effects to daily life gait performance still remains unclear. To obtain a comprehensive overview on whether and how perturbation-based gait training shows effects, we include measurements from the laboratory, clinical assessments on balance, gait, efficacy, falls and measurements from daily-life gait. To our knowledge this is the first RCT of its kind including older adults at risk of falling.

We aimed to design and test a 4-week treadmill training, with a combination of gait perturbation under dual task conditions, to maximize effects on balance and gait performance under real-life conditions.

A new treadmill module called REACT was developed for the C-mill (Motek Medical B.V. Amsterdam, the Netherlands), which allows belt perturbations in anterior-posterior direction in a safe manner. With this module, the C-Mill can accelerate or decelerate the belt quickly to mimic a slip or a trip and provoke a forward or backward balance loss, respectively. At the same time, cognitive dual tasks are provided to distract the participant and facilitate implicit learning, automatization and transfer to daily-life situations. Through a randomized clinical trial, we want to investigate the added value of a high number of perturbations in the experimental group under dual-task conditions compared to treadmill training under dual-task conditions without perturbations on daily life gait stability, balance performance, self-efficacy and falls.

The results of the randomized controlled trial proposed in this protocol may support application of perturbation-based treadmill training to enhance conventional (dual task) fall prevention training, facilitate automatization of skills and to reduce the training time needed to get a significant reduction of fall incidents. This may also reduce health care costs associated with falls.

### What type, or combination of exercise can improve preferred gait speed in older adults? A meta-analysis [^113GVgM9]. BMC Geriatrics (2015). Low credibility.

The results support the positive findings of Liu and Latham (2009, 2011) investigating the effect of progressive resistance training on physical disability, including evaluations of physical performance. However, they included younger (50 years and older), and more diverse research populations, and sometimes complementary interventions like vitamin supplementation versus placebo tablets. The meta-analysis of Lopopolo et al. found a very small positive change in preferred gait speed of 0.02 m/s resulting from strength training that was not clinically meaningful.

This is the first meta-analysis on the effect of exercise on preferred gait speed in older adults, that only included RCT's with high level of evidence. Furthermore, because there are so many types of exercise interventions, the differentiation in exercise modalities provides more insight in the effectiveness of specific types or combinations of exercise, to improve preferred gait speed in older adults. Although careful considerations were made, the choice in different sub-analyses, and assignment of interventions may be disputable in a few cases: In the first arm of the meta-analyses the study of Cress et al. not only provides progressive resistance training, but aerobic training as well. We included the study is this arm, because it was the only study that combined these two modalities and could not be analysed separately, and moreover, because the equipment that was used for the aerobic training was a stair stepper, and a kayak machine that both also improve leg strength. The study of Freiberger et al. and Doi et al. were included in the third arm of a combination of resistance-, balance-, and endurance training, although the first study also included a flexibility-, and the second also included a gait training component. The main components were however resistance-, balance-, and endurance training, unlike the combinations of interventions in the studies included in the multimodal arm of the analyses.

### Pilot comparative effectiveness study of surface perturbation treadmill training to prevent falls in older adults [^114mZCjV]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Falls are the leading cause of fatal and non-fatal injuries among older adults. Exercise programs appear to reduce fall risk, but the optimal type, frequency, and duration of exercise is unknown. External perturbations such as tripping and slipping are a major contributor to falls, and task-specific perturbation training to enhance dynamic stability has emerged as a promising approach to modifying fall risk. The purpose of this pilot study was 1) to determine the feasibility of conducting a large pragmatic randomized trial comparing a multidimensional exercise program inclusive of the surface perturbation treadmill training (SPTT) to multidimensional exercise alone (Standard PT); and 2) to assess fall outcomes between the two groups to determine whether an effect size large enough to warrant further study might be present.

Methods

A randomized pilot study at two outpatient physical therapy clinics. Participants were over age 64 and referred for gait and balance training. Feasibility for a larger randomized trial was assessed based on the ability of therapists to incorporate the SPTT into their clinical practice and acceptance of study participation by eligible patients. Falls were assessed by telephone interview 3 months after enrollment.

Results

Of 83 patients who were screened, 73 met inclusion criteria. SPTT was successfully adapted into clinical practice and 88% of eligible subjects were willing to be randomized, although 10% of the SPTT cohort dropped out prior to treatment. The SPTT group showed fewer subjects having any fall (19.23% vs. 33.33% Standard PT; p < 0.227) and fewer having an injurious fall (7.69% vs. 18.18%; p < 0.243). These results were not statistically significant but this pilot study was not powered for hypothesis testing.

Conclusions

Physical therapy inclusive of surface perturbation treadmill training appears clinically feasible, and randomization between these two PT interventions is acceptable to the majority of patients. These results appear to merit longer-term study in an adequately powered trial.

### Interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1113TSAe]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Recommendations of others — fall prevention in community-dwelling older adults — are summarized as follows: The CDC recommends STEADI, a coordinated approach for fall prevention in adults 65 years or older that consists of 3 core elements: screen to identify fall risk, assess modifiable risk factors, and intervene using effective clinical and community strategies to reduce the identified risk. The US Department of Health and Human Services recommends that older adults engage in multicomponent physical activity that includes balance training, as well as aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities, as part of the 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity, or 75 to 150 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity recommended for all adults. The American Academy of Family Physicians supports the USPSTF 2018 recommendation on fall prevention in community-dwelling older adults.

### Addition of a non-immersive virtual reality component to treadmill training to reduce fall risk in older adults (V-TIME): a randomised controlled trial [^113p74Q9]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

Age-associated motor and cognitive deficits increase the risk of falls, a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Because of the significant ramifications of falls, many interventions have been proposed, but few have aimed to prevent falls via an integrated approach targeting both motor and cognitive function. We aimed to test the hypothesis that an intervention combining treadmill training with non-immersive virtual reality (VR) to target both cognitive aspects of safe ambulation and mobility would lead to fewer falls than would treadmill training alone.

Methods

We carried out this randomised controlled trial at five clinical centres across five countries (Belgium, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, and the UK). Adults aged 60–90 years with a high risk of falls based on a history of two or more falls in the 6 months before the study and with varied motor and cognitive deficits were randomly assigned by use of computer-based allocation to receive 6 weeks of either treadmill training plus VR or treadmill training alone. Randomisation was stratified by subgroups of patients (those with a history of idiopathic falls, those with mild cognitive impairment, and those with Parkinson's disease) and sex, with stratification per clinical site. Group allocation was done by a third party not involved in onsite study procedures. Both groups aimed to train three times per week for 6 weeks, with each session lasting about 45 min and structured training progression individualised to the participant's level of performance. The VR system consisted of a motion-capture camera and a computer-generated simulation projected on to a large screen, which was specifically designed to reduce fall risk in older adults by including real-life challenges such as obstacles, multiple pathways, and distracters that required continual adjustment of steps. The primary outcome was the incident rate of falls during the 6 months after the end of training, which was assessed in a modified intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who were assigned a treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01732653.

Findings

Between Jan 6, 2013, and April 3, 2015, 302 adults were randomly assigned to either the treadmill training plus VR group (n = 154) or treadmill training alone group (n = 148). Data from 282 (93%) participants were included in the prespecified, modified intention-to-treat analysis. Before training, the incident rate of falls was similar in both groups (10.7 [SD 35.6] falls per 6 months for treadmill training alone vs 11.9 [39.5] falls per 6 months for treadmill training plus VR). In the 6 months after training, the incident rate was significantly lower in the treadmill training plus VR group than it had been before training (6.00 [95% CI 4.36–8.25] falls per 6 months; p < 0.0001 vs before training), whereas the incident rate did not decrease significantly in the treadmill training alone group (8.27 [5.55–12.31] falls per 6 months; p = 0.49). 6 months after the end of training, the incident rate of falls was also significantly lower in the treadmill training plus VR group than in the treadmill training group (incident rate ratio 0.58, 95% CI 0.36–0.96; p = 0.033). No serious training-related adverse events occurred.

Interpretation

In a diverse group of older adults at high risk for falls, treadmill training plus VR led to reduced fall rates compared with treadmill training alone.

### A best practice fall prevention exercise program to improve balance, strength / power, and psychosocial health in older adults: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial [^116oBVpg]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

The nationwide implementation of effective fall prevention exercise programs in industrial countries is limited. The present trial applies and evaluates a public practice guide for balance and strength / power training that may provide a feasible, safe, and effective approach for fall prevention in older adults. In contrast to an epidemiological approach, in this trial, we will conduct an intervention based on three major intrinsic fall risk factors (balance impairments, gait instabilities, and muscle weakness). This will allow the use of several extensive clinical and biomechanical measurement tools for evaluation purposes. The proposed exercises require relatively low supervision and material costs, and offer practical information in terms of training volume, (i.e. type, frequency, duration) and intensity. A major advantage of this intervention compared to earlier fall prevention exercise programs is its broad and cost-free applicability and sustainability for German and French speaking older adults.

The expected effect of our fall prevention exercise program is based on a large recent meta-analysis by Gillespie et al. who showed that multiple-component group exercise and home-based exercise reduce the rate of falls and fall risk (rate ratio 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 0.82 and risk ratio 0.85, 95%CI 0.76 to 0.96 vs. rate ratio 0.68, 95%CI 0.58 to 0.80 and risk ratio 0.78, 95%CI 0.64 to 0.94). Previous studies showed that combined balance and resistance training may positively affect physical (i.e. balance and strength), mental (i.e. quality of life and fear of falling), and functional performance (i.e. ADL). Uncertainty remains if resistance training alone is sufficient to prevent falls in older adults. Recent studies reported that especially muscle power exercises with lower loads and faster movement velocities improve ADL and therefore may be superior compared to traditional progressive resistance training. In contrast, balance exercises are recommended for all older adults who had a fall, however, there is hardly any evidence about training load, volume, and frequency.

### Dual-task training with progression from variable-to fixed-priority instructions versus dual-task training with variable-priority on gait speed in community-dwelling older adults: a protocol for a randomized controlled trial: variable-and fixed-priority dual-task for older adults [^116euHiV]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Functional independence and safe mobility, especially in older people, mostly rely on the ability to perform dual tasks, particularly during activities with variable- and fixed-priority attention. The aim of this study is to compare the dual-task training with progression from variable- to fixed-priority instructions versus dual-task training with variable-priority on gait speed in community-dwelling older adults.

Methods

This is an assessor- and participant-blinded, two-arm, randomized controlled trial with 60 community-dwelling male and female older adults between the ages of 60 and 80years old. Participants will be randomly allocated into either the intervention group or the control group using a computer-generated permuted block randomization schedule. The intervention group will undertake a progressive dual-task training in which the participants will be progressively submitted to dual-task walking and postural balance exercises with variable- to fixed-priority instructions. The control group will be submitted to dual-task training with variable-priority attention exercises. Both groups will receive 48 sessions lasting for 60min each over 24weeks. The primary outcome will be the gait speed under single- and dual-task conditions. Secondary outcomes will include spatiotemporal gait parameters, functional balance, executive function, falls, quality of life, and depression symptoms. All the analyses will be based on the intention-to-treat principle.

Discussion

This is the first assessor- and participant-blinded, two-arm, randomized controlled trial with 6months of intervention and an additional 6-month post-training follow up aiming to evaluate the effectiveness of training with progression from variable- to fixed-priority instructions on gait biomechanics, postural balance, falls episodes, executive functioning, and quality of life in community-dwelling older adults. If our hypotheses are confirmed, this training protocol can be implemented widely to improve gait speed and other functional activities and quality of life in community-dwelling older adults. This study protocol can be used to improve these functional aspects of community-dwelling older adults. This study may also contribute to future guidelines for the improvement of these clinical and biomechanical aspects in older people.

### Effectiveness of robot-assisted training in adults with Parkinson's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113NPqLt]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

This work aimed to update and summarize the existing evidence on the effectiveness of robot-assisted training (RAT) in adults with Parkinson's disease (PD).

Methods

We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis, reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (PROSPERO CRD42022371124). Seven databases and two trial registries were searched for randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) addressing RAT alone or in addition to other treatments in adults with PD up to January 2024. Primary outcomes were disease-specific motor impairment, balance, mobility, freezing of gait, falls, number of people who fell at least once, and adverse events. Meta-analysis using a random-effects model was performed. Risk of bias (RoB) and certainty of the evidence for the primary outcomes were assessed using the Cochrane RoB Tool and the Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, respectively.

Results

Fifteen RCTs (629 randomized adults with PD) were included. Our results show that the evidence is very uncertain about the effectiveness of any kind of RAT, either focused on gait, balance or upper limb impairment, compared to any comparator (treadmill training, overground gait training, exercises without the exoskeleton, conventional physical therapy, balance training, and no treatment), mainly because of RoB, inconsistency in individual studies results, and very limited number (less than 200) of participants considered in each comparison.

Conclusion

In light of the aforementioned very low certainty evidence, clinical considerations should be drawn very carefully. High-quality studies are thus highly needed to investigate potential benefits, risks, and cost/benefit ratio of RAT in adults with PD.

### Effect of treadmill perturbation-based balance training on fall rates in community-dwelling older adults: a randomized clinical trial [^1122PwG7]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Daily-Life and Laboratory Falls

For the primary outcome, 62 falls in the PBT group (rate of falls per person-year of follow-up: 0.90; 95% CI, 0.58–1.21) and 78 in the control group (rate of falls per person-year of follow-up: 1.14; 95% CI, 0.76–1.52) were reported, resulting in a nonsignificant 22% relative between-group difference in fall rates (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.78; 95% CI, 0.48–1.27) (Figure 3 and Table 2). No significant between-group differences in any secondary daily-life fall outcomes were found (Table 2).

### Perturbation-based gait training to improve daily life gait stability in older adults at risk of falling: protocol for the REACT randomized controlled trial [^113d41BQ]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

To reduce fall incidence and rising health care costs it is imperative to prevent falls. Several studies have revealed that fall risk among older adults can be reduced by exercise interventions. Conventional training programmes have been shown to be effective in falls prevention, but require a relatively long and intensive training period and the positive effects after finishing the training period are hard to maintain.

A novel and promising approach in fall prevention is perturbation-based gait training. Perturbation-based training challenges anticipatory as well as reactive balance control. Anticipatory balance control refers to adjusting posture and stepping behavior to overcome risky situations, i.e. changing to small and slow steps with a low center of mass position when walking over slippery floors, uneven surfaces or stairs. This might increase safety, but if a slip or trip does occur, one also needs to react adequately to recover balance. Reactive responses to unexpected perturbations during walking are task specific. It is known that task-specific training leads to strong learning effects. Learning how to recover from a perturbation in daily life by exercising near-fall situations appears to improve motor responses. Adaptions in reactive control and stability were found after a single session of perturbation training. Therefore, experiencing near-fall situations in a safe environment could facilitate the reactive control of balance in a daily life situation and may have potential for fall prevention. Walking under dual-task conditions has been shown to improve both balance and cognitive performance and is associated with better gait stability. In a 4-week training study with older adults by Silsupadol et al. the treadmill walking group with added dual task exercises significantly increased gait speed and balance scores on the Berg Balance Scale. In addition, there is evidence for the effectiveness of specific training to improve postural control in healthy older adults under dual-task conditions. Adding a dual-task component to a motor-learning intervention can facilitate learning, automatization of the motor task and transfer to daily-life situations, by distracting participants from the primary motor-task. This has indeed been shown in 4- and 6-weeks conventional treadmill gait training programmes with dual-tasking, in which older adults improved in balance, gait and dual-task performance.

### What type, or combination of exercise can improve preferred gait speed in older adults? A meta-analysis [^113ud15m]. BMC Geriatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Improved preferred gait speed in older adults is associated with increased survival rates. There are inconsistent findings in clinical trials regarding effects of exercise on preferred gait speed, and heterogeneity in interventions in the current reviews and meta-analyses.

Objective

to determine the meta-effects of different types or combinations of exercise interventions from randomized controlled trials on improvement in preferred gait speed.

Data Sources

A literature search was performed; the following databases were searched for studies from 1990 up to 9 December 2013: PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO (AMED, CINAHL, ERIC, Medline, PsycInfo, and SocINDEX), and the Cochrane Library.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Randomized controlled trials of exercise interventions for older adults ≥ 65 years, that provided quantitative data (mean/SD) on preferred gait speed at baseline and post-intervention, as a primary or secondary outcome measure in the published article were included. Studies were excluded when the PEDro score was ≤ 4, or if participants were selected for a specific neurological or neurodegenerative disease, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, cardiovascular disease, recent lower limb fractures, lower limb joint replacements, or severe cognitive impairments. The meta-effect is presented in Forest plots with 95% confidence

Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

intervals and random weights assigned to each trial. Homogeneity and risk of publication bias were assessed.

Results

Twenty-five studies were analysed in this meta-analysis. Data from six types or combinations of exercise interventions were pooled into sub-analyses. First, there is a significant positive meta-effect of resistance training progressed to 70–80% of 1RM on preferred gait speed of 0.13 [CI 95% 0.09–0.16] m/s. The difference between intervention- and control groups shows a substantial meaningful change (> 0.1 m/s). Secondly, a significant positive meta-effect of interventions with a rhythmic component on preferred gait speed of 0.07 [CI 95% 0.03–0.10] m/s was found. Thirdly, there is a small significant positive meta-effect of progressive resistance training, combined with balance-, and endurance training of 0.05 [CI 95% 0.00–0.09] m/s. The other sub-analyses show non-significant small positive meta-affects.

Conclusions

Progressive resistance training with high intensities, is the most effective exercise modality for improving preferred gait speed. Sufficient muscle strength seems an important condition for improving preferred gait speed. The addition of balance-, and/or endurance training does not contribute to the significant positive effects of progressive resistance training. A promising component is exercise with a rhythmic component. Keeping time to music or rhythm possibly trains higher cognitive functions that are important for gait.

Limitations

The focus of the present meta-analysis was at avoiding as much heterogeneity in exercise interventions. However heterogeneity in the research populations could not be completely avoided, there are probably differences in health status within different studies.

### Unexpected perturbations training improves balance control and voluntary stepping times in older adults-a double blind randomized control trial [^114vaeDt]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Motivated by the above perturbations training studies and trying to accommodate for some of the issues mentioned above (i.e. perturbation training while standing or walking in place; highly predictable repeated-right leg slip exposure; a very unnatural walking on split treadmill), we aimed to explore whether unexpected multidirectional perturbation training while walking on a treadmill can reduce risks of falls in independent older adults. A perturbation exercise while walking provides a more realistic balance training that is sufficiently task-specific so that responses on this training regime will be more likely to be transferred to other measures of balance control and voluntary stepping measures.

Our hypotheses were that following exposure to a gait training program that includes unexpected perturbations exercises during walking will significantly improve voluntary stepping times as well as balance control in older adults, two factors that are associated with falls and injuries related with falls. We believe that perturbation exercises that will challenge both balance control during walking as well as trigger a quick stepping responses to avoid fall during walking. These postural response following an external perturbation receives a higher priority than a voluntary action thus can be incorporated into centrally programmed voluntary movements. This concept should be of importance for balance training and it further supports the notion that postural perturbations should be incorporated into balance training programs.

### Unexpected perturbations training improves balance control and voluntary stepping times in older adults-a double blind randomized control trial [^117F88WR]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

The perturbations were in anterior-posterior direction (i.e. sudden acceleration or stop of treadmills belt) and sudden medio-lateral horizontal translation of the treadmill that challenges the medio-lateral dynamic control. During all sessions, 400 ms horizontal surface translations were delivered as the subject walked on the treadmill. The velocity profiles were triangular waveforms with peak velocities of 0.1–3.2 m/s, resulting in displacements of 1–18 cm and peak accelerations of 0.5–16.0 m/s². Perturbation timing was preset and therefore was not given in a specific phase of the gait cycle or to a specific leg. The perturbation training program had 24 levels of difficulty with increasing levels of perturbations (i.e. increased displacement, velocity and accelerations of the horizontal translations, see Table 1). The difficulty level was adjusted according to the subject abilities, starting from the lowest level of 1 cm displacement at 0.1 m/s velocity and 0.5 m/s² acceleration at the first training session. If the subject was able to recover from all perturbations during the session (i.e. did not fell during the session) and felt that he can be further challenged, a higher level of perturbation was introduced in the next session. If not, the same level of perturbation was introduced again until successfully dealt with. Fall during the training session was defined as load cell sensors detected 30% or more body weight suspended by the safety harness.

Details of Protocol Used in the perturbation intervention training program

The 24 training sessions. Each session lasted 20 min, included 3 min warm-up treadmill walking, 14 min of perturbations during comfortable treadmill walking, given in random direction (right, left, forward and backwards), and 3 min of cool down walking. The perturbation training program had 24 levels of difficulty with increasing levels of perturbations (i.e. increased displacement, velocity and accelerations of the horizontal translations). During each session, the listed platform translation unannounced perturbations were delivered in an unpredictable randomized sequence, in the directions indicated (forward, backward, left, and right). Perturbations for the treadmill walking were occur randomly (i.e. occurs in all phases of gait cycle) in order to increase the ecological validity. The perturbation was delivered after 20–30 s approximately every 20 strides and was triggered randomly

### Physiotherapy versus placebo or no intervention in Parkinson's disease [^112hwJ3i]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Despite medical therapies and surgical interventions for Parkinson's disease (PD), patients develop progressive disability. Physiotherapy aims to maximise functional ability and minimise secondary complications through movement rehabilitation within a context of education and support for the whole person. The overall aim is to optimise independence, safety, and well-being, thereby enhancing quality of life.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of physiotherapy intervention compared with no intervention in patients with PD.

Search Methods

We identified relevant trials by conducting electronic searches of numerous literature databases (e.g. MEDLINE, EMBASE) and trial registers, and by handsearching major journals, abstract books, conference proceedings, and reference lists of retrieved publications. The literature search included trials published up to the end of January 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of physiotherapy intervention versus no physiotherapy intervention in patients with PD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data from each article. We used standard meta-analysis methods to assess the effectiveness of physiotherapy intervention compared with no physiotherapy intervention. Trials were classified into the following intervention comparisons: general physiotherapy, exercise, treadmill training, cueing, dance, and martial arts. We used tests for heterogeneity to assess for differences in treatment effect across these different physiotherapy interventions.

Main Results

We identified 39 trials with 1827 participants. We considered the trials to be at a mixed risk of bias as the result of unreported allocation concealment and probable detection bias. Compared with no intervention, physiotherapy significantly improved the gait outcomes of speed (mean difference 0.04 m/s, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.06, P = 0.0002); two- or six-minute walk test (13.37 m, 95% CI 0.55 to 26.20, P = 0.04) and Freezing of Gait questionnaire (-1.41, 95% CI -2.63 to -0.19, P = 0.02); functional mobility and balance outcomes of Timed Up & Go test (-0.63 s, 95% CI -1.05 to -0.21, P = 0.003), Functional Reach Test (2.16 cm, 95% CI 0.89 to 3.43, P = 0.0008), and Berg Balance Scale (3.71 points, 95% CI 2.30 to 5.11, P < 0.00001); and clinician-rated disability using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) (total -6.15 points, 95% CI-8.57 to -3.73, P < 0.00001; activities of daily living: -1.36, 95% CI -2.41 to -0.30, P = 0.01; and motor: -5.01, 95% CI -6.30 to -3.72, P < 0.00001). No difference between arms was noted in falls (Falls Efficacy Scale: -1.91 points, 95% CI -4.76 to 0.94, P = 0.19) or patient-rated quality of life (PDQ-39 Summary Index: -0.38 points, 95% CI -2.58 to 1.81, P = 0.73). One study reported that adverse events were rare; no other studies reported data on this outcome. Indirect comparisons of the different physiotherapy interventions revealed no evidence that the treatment effect differed across physiotherapy interventions for any of the outcomes assessed.

Authors' Conclusions

Benefit for physiotherapy was found in most outcomes over the short term (i.e. < 3 months) but was significant only for speed, two- or six-minute walk test, Freezing of Gait questionnaire, Timed Up & Go, Functional Reach Test, Berg Balance Scale, and clinician-rated UPDRS. Most of the observed differences between treatments were small. However, for some outcomes (e.g. speed, Berg Balance Scale, UPDRS), the differences observed were at, or approaching, what are considered minimal clinically important changes. These benefits should be interpreted with caution because the quality of most of the included trials was not high. Variation in measurements of outcome between studies meant that our analyses include a small proportion of the participants recruited. This review illustrates that a wide range of approaches are employed by physiotherapists to treat patients with PD. However, no evidence of differences in treatment effect was noted between the different types of physiotherapy interventions being used, although this was based on indirect comparisons. A consensus menu of 'best practice' physiotherapy is needed, as are large, well-designed randomised controlled trials undertaken to demonstrate the longer-term efficacy and cost-effectiveness of 'best practice' physiotherapy in PD.

### Effects of sensorimotor adaptation training on functional mobility in older adults [^112qvkwb]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2008). Low credibility.

The goal of this study was to determine if prolonged exposure to perceptual-motor mismatch increased adaptability and retention of balance in older adults. Sixteen adults, aged 66 to 81 years, were randomized to one of two groups: either the control group (n = 8) or the experimental group (n = 8). Both groups first completed six trials of walking an obstacle course. Participants then trained twice a week for 4 weeks. In the training, the control group walked on a treadmill for 20 minutes while viewing a static visual scene and the experimental group walked on a treadmill for 20 minutes while viewing a rotating visual scene that provided a perceptual-motor mismatch. Following training, both groups were post-tested on the obstacle course. The experimental group moved faster through the obstacle course with fewer penalties. This training effect was retained for 4 weeks. Exposure to perceptual-motor mismatch induced an adaptive training effect that improved balance and locomotor control in older adults.

### Perturbation-based gait training to improve daily life gait stability in older adults at risk of falling: protocol for the REACT randomized controlled trial [^115xQWqe]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The European population is rapidly ageing. There is an urgent need for innovative solutions to reduce fall risk in older adults. Perturbation-based gait training is a promising new method to improve reactive balance responses. Whereas positive effects on task-specific dynamic balance recovery during gait have been shown in clinical or laboratory settings, translation of these effects to daily life gait function and fall risk is limited. We aim to evaluate the effect of a 4-week perturbation-based treadmill training on daily-life dynamic gait stability, assessed with inertial sensor data. Secondary outcomes are balance recovery performance, clinical balance and gait assessment scores, the amount of physical activity in daily life and falls incidence during 6months follow-up.

Methods

The study is a monocenter assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial. The target study sample consists of 70 older adults of 65years and older, living in the community and with an elevated risk of falling. A block-randomization to avoid seasonal effects will be used to allocate the participants into two groups. The experimental group receives a 4-week, two times per week perturbation-based gait training programme on a treadmill, with simulated slips and trips, in combination with cognitive dual tasks. The control group receives a 4-week, two times per week treadmill training programme under cognitive dual-task conditions without perturbations. Participants will be assessed at baseline and after the 4-weeks intervention period on their daily-life gait stability by wearing an inertial sensor on the lower back for seven consecutive days. In addition, clinical balance and gait assessments as well as questionnaires on falls- and gait-efficacy will be taken. Daily life falls will be followed up over 6 months by a fall calendar.

Discussion

Whereas perturbation-based training has shown positive effects in improving balance recovery strategies and in reducing laboratory falls, this study will contribute to investigate the translation of perturbation-based treadmill training effects in a clinical setting towards improving daily life gait stability and reducing fall risk and falls.

### Does dual task training improve walking performance of older adults with concern of falling? [^114scTy4]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Older adults with concerns of falling show decrements of gait stability under single (ST) and dual task (DT) conditions.

To compare the effects of a DT training integrating task managing strategies for independent living older adults with and without concern about falling (CoF) to a non-training control group on walking performance under ST and DT conditions.

Methods

Single center parallel group single blind randomized controlled trial with group-based interventions (DT-managing balance training) compared to a control group (Ninety-five independent living older adults; 71.5 ± 5.2 years).

A progressive DT training (12 sessions; 60 min each; 12 weeks) including task-managing strategies was compared to a non-training control group. Setting: group based intervention for independent living elderly in a gym. ST and DT walking (visual verbal Stroop task) were measured on a treadmill. Gait parameters (step length, step width, and gait line) and cognitive performance while walking were compared with a 2x2x2 Repeated Measures Analyses of Variance.

Results

Participants in the intervention group showed an increased step length under ST and DT conditions following the intervention, for both people with and without CoF compared to their respective control groups. Foot rolling movement and cognitive performance while walking however only improved in participants without CoF.

Conclusions

The results showed that DT managing training can improve walking performance under ST and DT conditions in people with and without CoF. Additional treatment to directly address CoF, such as cognitive behavioural therapy, should be considered to further improve the cautious gait pattern (as evidenced by reduced foot rolling movements).

Trial registration

The study was retrospectively registered in the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS; Identification number, 11.05.2017).

### Interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116RiHoB]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Response to public comment — exercise intervention components and high-risk populations — notes that the studies of exercise interventions it reviewed varied in several ways, such as providing individual vs group sessions and in the exercise components of the interventions, that nearly all exercise interventions included gait, balance, and functional training, and most included a strength and resistance training component, and that research gaps include groups at high risk of falls, such as persons 85 years or older.

### The effect of perturbation-based balance training on balance control and fear of falling in older adults: a single-blind randomised controlled trial [^116zySHp]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Falls annually affect one in three adults over 65 years. In 2019, approximately 109.000 Dutch adults over 65 years visited the emergency department due to a fall incident, resulting in over 1 billion euros of direct medical costs. Falls are a leading cause of injuries and hospitalization among older adults and can have many physical and psychological adverse consequences. The risk of falling increases with age and can increase even further in the presence of additional risk factors. An important and modifiable risk factor for falls is balance control. Having experienced a fall incident is another prognostic factor, which greatly increases the risk of sustaining future falls (odds ratio (OR) 2.8 for all fallers, and 3.5 for recurrent fallers). Consequently, older adults who have fallen are also more likely to develop fear of falling, and to experience a further decline in balance control after their fall incident. Since fear of falling and impaired balance control both increase the risk for falls, this illustrates how a single fall incident can cause older adults to end up in a negative cycle. Given that the number of older adults is currently increasing rapidly, the burden of falls will continue to increase. Therefore, it is essential to develop interventions that make older adults more resistant to fall incidents.

Balance training is reported to effectively improve balance control and reduce fall rates in older adults by approximately 24%. Nonetheless, there are some drawbacks to conventional balance training interventions. Firstly, it should be understood that 'balance control' is an umbrella concept that can be subdivided into multiple motor skills, each of which is vital to perform activities of daily living. As described by Berg et al. balance control can be divided into three general categories: maintaining a position (static balance control), adjusting voluntary or anticipated movements (proactive balance control), and reacting to external or unexpected balance perturbations (reactive balance control). Conventional balance training programs do not typically address reactive balance control but focus mostly on proactive balance control. However, approximately 60% of falls in older adults result from an unexpected external perturbation during walking, such as a slip or trip. As the recovery actions needed to prevent such falls rely mostly on reactive balance control, the task-specificity of conventional balance training may be limited. Additionally, conventional balance training requires a relatively high number of training sessions to be effective, and retention of training effects is hard to accomplish. As such, research to optimize balance training interventions for older adults continues.

Interventions for community dwelling older adults at intermediate fall risk

Expert recommendation. Offer an exercise programme based on an individual assessment and according to the recommendations in the Exercise Interventions section (see algorithm, Figure 1). GRADE: E.

Recommendation details and justification

Supervised exercises that target balance and strength prevent falls. Fall prevention exercise should focus on maintaining balance during functional tasks needed for daily life. The most relevant tasks for individuals vary according to lifestyle, domestic needs, physical function, environment and preferences.
Effective fall prevention programmes include individualised exercises that enable or support daily tasks or similar movements. Such exercises include sit-to-stand, squats, reaching which standing, standing with a narrower base of support, stepping and walking in different directions, speeds, environments and while dual tasking. Weights can be added to some exercises to increase difficulty. Exercises should be challenging (to enhance neural, muscular and skeletal function) but safe (to prevent injuries) and achievable (for sufficient dose and sense of mastery). Exercises should be reviewed and progressed regularly to ensure that optimal level of difficulty is maintained.

### Virtual reality augments effectiveness of treadmill walking training in patients with walking and balance impairments: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114fdfFm]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To systematically summarize and examine current evidence regarding the combination of virtual reality and treadmill training in patients with walking and balance impairments.

Data Sources

English language randomized controlled trials, participants with walking and balance impairments, intervention group used virtual reality and treadmill, control group only used treadmill with the same training frequency and number of sessions. Six bioscience and engineering databases were searched.

Methods

Two independent reviewers conducted study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment. Methodological quality was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale.

Results

Sixteen randomized controlled trials including 829 participants were identified. Compared to treadmill-only training, virtual reality augmented treadmill training induced significantly faster walking (p < 0.001; standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.55, 95%CI: 0.30 to 0.81), longer step length (p < 0.001; SMD = 0.74, 95%CI: 0.42 to 1.06), narrower step width (p = 0.03; SMD = -0.52, 95%CI: -0.97 to -0.06), longer single leg stance period (p = 0.003; SMD = 0.77, 95%CI: 0.27 to 1.27), better functional mobility (p = 0.003; SMD = -0.44, 95%CI:-0.74 to -0.15), improved balance function (p = 0.04; SMD = 0.24, 95%CI: 0.01 to 0.47), and enhanced balance confidence (p = 0.03; SMD = 0.73, 95%CI: 0.08 to 1.37). Walking endurance did not differ significantly between groups (p = 0.21; SMD = 0.13, 95%CI: -0.07 to 0.34).

Conclusions

Virtual reality augmented treadmill walking training enhances outcomes compared to treadmill-only training in patients with walking and balance impairments. The results of this review support the clinical significance of combining virtual reality with treadmill training with level 1A empirical evidence.

### New intervention program for preventing falls among frail elderly people: the effects of perturbed walking exercise using a bilateral separated treadmill [^112rXJDR]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the effects of a perturbed walking exercise using a bilateral separated treadmill in physically disabled elderly.

Design

Participants of the study were 32 long-term care facility residents and outpatients aged 66–98 yrs. Participants were randomly assigned to a usual exercise group or to a treadmill exercise group. Perturbed gait exercise on a treadmill continued for 6 mos. Number of falls and time to first fall during a 6-mo period, balance and gait functions, and reaction time were evaluated before and after intervention.

Results

The treadmill exercise group showed significant improvement in balance and reaction time when compared with the usual exercise group. Number of falls in the treadmill exercise group was 21% lower than that in the usual exercise group. However, this difference was not significant. No significant differences were seen in time to first fall.

Conclusions

Gait training with unexpected perturbation seems to have a beneficial impact on physical function in disabled elderly individuals. The results suggest that this program may be used as an exercise intervention to reduce falls in institutional settings.

### Unexpected perturbations training improves balance control and voluntary stepping times in older adults-a double blind randomized control trial [^1167VTKT]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

The control group received 24 sessions, twice a week for 12 weeks, 20 min treadmill walking on the same treadmill but without unexpected perturbations. similar to the intervention group the control group subjects walked at their own preferred speed and in their own walking shoes, with their hands free to swing; there were no handrails on the treadmill, thus they wore a loose safety harnesses that allowed comfortable walking. Since both group trained on the same system, they were blinded to the allocation to intervention or control group.
