## Question

Rash after fever disappeared in two years old

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a 2-year-old who developed a rash after the fever resolved. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely diagnosis given the timing of rash after defervescence. Then, I should verify key differentials that can mimic this pattern. Next, I will review red flags that would change urgency. After that, I need to check what, if any, diagnostic testing is reasonable. Finally, I will outline management, prognosis, and parent counseling, and I will double-check that each assertion aligns with the best available evidence.

> Let me first confirm the leading diagnosis. The classic pattern of high fever for several days followed by the appearance of a rash as the fever abates is characteristic of roseola infantum due to human herpesvirus 6, with HHV-7 as a less common cause; this timing is the hallmark that helps distinguish it from many other viral exanthems in this age group [^a92a51cb] [^754f3f35].

> Wait, let me verify the age epidemiology and typical course. Primary HHV-6 infection most often occurs between 6 months and 2–3 years of age, and roseola presents with 3–5 days of high fever that resolves, followed within 24–48 hours by a pink, maculopapular, nonpruritic rash on the trunk and extremities that lasts about 1–3 days and fades without desquamation; children are usually well-appearing once the fever breaks, which fits this vignette [^754f3f35] [^a92a51cb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review key differentials that can look similar. Erythema infectiosum (parvovirus B19) can follow a prodrome and show a "slapped cheek" facial rash with a lacy reticular extremity rash, but the facial prominence and the tendency for the rash to wax and wane for weeks are not typical of roseola; Gianotti-Crosti syndrome produces a symmetric acral papular or papulovesicular eruption that can persist for weeks and often follows a viral illness; enteroviral infections can produce varied exanthems and hand-foot-mouth disease; and measles/rubella have different prodromes and timing, making them less likely here given the defervescence-then-rash sequence [^a92a51cb] [^57a85447] [^c65b8334] [^59509540].

> I need to ensure I screen for danger signs that would change management. If the child is ill-appearing, has persistent fever beyond a week, a petechial or purpuric rash, mucosal bleeding, respiratory distress, altered mental status, or signs of shock, I should escalate urgently to consider entities like meningococcemia, RMSF, invasive streptococcal disease, or MIS-C; in those scenarios, immediate evaluation and empiric therapy may be warranted even before confirmatory testing returns [^ee7d974c] [^cd49ce7b] [^f44d06dc] [^71198b42].

> Let me consider what testing, if any, is appropriate. For a well-appearing 2-year-old with classic roseola timing and exam, no routine labs are needed; diagnosis is clinical. If the presentation is atypical or the child is immunocompromised, targeted testing can be considered, but routine HHV-6 PCR is not indicated in immunocompetent hosts; in contrast, if fever and petechiae are present, I should obtain CBC, inflammatory markers, blood culture, and consider RMSF or meningococcal testing based on risk and season, because delays worsen outcomes [^a92a51cb] [^754f3f35] [^2e2e73e9] [^f44d06dc].

> Next, I should review management. Supportive care is the mainstay: antipyretics for comfort, hydration, and observation. No antiviral therapy is indicated for uncomplicated HHV-6 roseola, and antibiotics are not helpful unless bacterial coinfection is suspected; I should confirm that parents know to return if the child becomes lethargic, develops new respiratory symptoms, a bleeding rash, or fever persists beyond about a week [^a92a51cb] [^754f3f35].

> I will now examine prognosis and counseling. Roseola is self-limited, with the rash typically resolving within a few days and no long-term sequelae; febrile seizures can occur during the febrile phase, but recurrence risk is not increased; parents should be reassured that the rash is not contagious once it appears, even though the virus is ubiquitous in early childhood, and future recurrences are uncommon in immunocompetent hosts [^754f3f35] [^a92a51cb].

> But wait, what if the rash is atypical or persistent? If the morphology is vesiculobullous, acral, or purpuric, or if the rash lasts beyond about 10–14 days, I should reconsider alternatives such as Gianotti-Crosti, enteroviral infections, drug eruptions, or vasculitides; in those cases, a careful repeat history, exam, and selective testing may be warranted to avoid missing a treatable or more serious condition [^a92a51cb] [^57a85447] [^dcb3d8d8].

> In summary, I should confirm that the most likely diagnosis is roseola infantum due to HHV-6 given the classic sequence of high fever resolving just before the onset of a nonpruritic maculopapular rash in a 2-year-old, with no immediate testing or treatment required if the child is well-appearing; I will provide anticipatory guidance and clear return precautions, and I will keep a low threshold to reassess if red flags emerge or the course deviates from the expected benign trajectory [^a92a51cb] [^754f3f35].

A rash appearing after fever resolves in a 2-year-old is most often due to **roseola infantum** (HHV-6) [^754f3f35], with a classic pattern of high fever for 3–5 days followed by a pink, maculopapular rash as the fever breaks [^a92a51cb]. Other common causes include **parvovirus B19** (fifth disease) with a "slapped cheek" and lacy rash [^4272cfb5], and **enteroviruses** (e.g. coxsackie) with hand-foot-mouth or vesicular rashes [^dcb3d8d8]. Most are self-limited and require only supportive care; however, red flags such as petechiae, purpura, mucosal bleeding, respiratory distress, altered mental status, or persistent fever warrant urgent evaluation for serious infections like meningococcemia or RMSF [^ee7d974c] [^f44d06dc]. Management is supportive unless a specific diagnosis is made, and parents should be counseled on warning signs and follow-up [^a92a51cb].

## Common causes of rash after fever resolution in 2-year-olds

| **Etiology** | **Clinical features** | **Timing and course** | **Associated symptoms** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Roseola infantum (HHV-6) | Pink, maculopapular rash on trunk and extremities | Appears as fever resolves after 3–5 days; lasts 1–3 days | High fever, irritability, mild URI symptoms [^754f3f35] |
| Parvovirus B19 (fifth disease) | "Slapped cheek" facial rash, then lacy reticular rash on trunk and limbs | Rash appears after fever resolves; may recur with heat or stress | Mild fever, malaise, arthralgia (more common in older children) [^4272cfb5] |
| Enteroviruses (coxsackie, echovirus) | Vesicular or papular rash, often on hands, feet, buttocks, or generalized | Rash appears after fever or concurrently; lasts 7–10 days | Fever, URI symptoms, oral ulcers, diarrhea [^dcb3d8d8] |
| Measles (rubeola) | Morbilliform rash starting on face, spreading downward | Rash appears 3–7 days after fever onset; fever persists with rash | Cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, Koplik spots [^59509540] |
| Rubella | Pink, maculopapular rash, mild | Rash appears after brief fever; lasts 3 days | Lymphadenopathy, mild URI symptoms [^c65b8334] |
| Scarlet fever (GAS) | Sandpaper-like erythematous rash, circumoral pallor | Rash appears 1–2 days after fever onset | Sore throat, strawberry tongue, fever [^4272cfb5] |

## Clinical evaluation and diagnostic approach

- **History**: Document fever duration and pattern, prodromal symptoms, exposures (travel, animals, sick contacts), vaccination status, and medication use [^ee7d974c].
- **Physical examination**: Assess rash morphology, distribution, mucosal involvement, lymphadenopathy, and organomegaly [^7565e82b].
- **Laboratory testing**: Generally not indicated for classic presentations; consider CBC, CRP, ESR, blood culture, or specific serologies if atypical or severe features are present [^ee7d974c].
- **Imaging**: Not routine; consider chest X-ray if respiratory symptoms or suspected pneumonia [^notfound].

---

## Management and treatment

- **Supportive care**: Antipyretics, hydration, and topical agents for pruritus are the mainstay for most viral exanthems [^a92a51cb].
- **Antibiotics**: Only if bacterial infection is confirmed or strongly suspected (e.g. scarlet fever, meningococcemia) [^notfound].
- **Parent education**: Explain the benign course, expected duration, and warning signs that require urgent care [^a92a51cb].

---

## Potential complications and prognosis

Most viral exanthems in this age group are **self-limited** with excellent prognosis [^4a615e49]. Complications are rare but may include febrile seizures with roseola, arthritis with parvovirus, or secondary bacterial infection. Serious complications (e.g. encephalitis, myocarditis) are uncommon but require vigilance [^754f3f35] [^4272cfb5].

---

## Red flag symptoms requiring immediate medical attention

- Petechial or purpuric rash
- Mucosal bleeding
- Respiratory distress or cyanosis
- Altered mental status or seizures
- Persistent high fever beyond 5 days
- Signs of dehydration or shock [^ee7d974c]

---

A rash appearing after fever resolves in a 2-year-old is most often due to **roseola infantum** or other common viral exanthems, typically benign and self-limited. Supportive care suffices unless red flags suggest serious disease, prompting urgent evaluation and targeted therapy [^a92a51cb].

### Fever and rash [^ee7d974c]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Infectious causes of fever and rash pose a diagnostic challenge for the emergency provider. It is often difficult to discern rashes associated with rapidly progressive and life-threatening infections from benign exanthems, which comprise the majority of rashes seen in the emergency department. Physicians must also consider serious noninfectious causes of fever and rash. A correct diagnosis depends on an exhaustive history and head-to-toe skin examination as most emergent causes of fever and rash remain clinical diagnoses. A provisional diagnosis and immediate treatment with antimicrobials and supportive care are usually required prior to the return of confirmatory laboratory testing.

### Fever and rash: a changing landscape in the 21st century [^eaec4e39]. Clinical Pediatric Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Although "fever and rash" is a common complaint in the pediatric emergency department, most causes are benign. Of the more severe causes, several have been greatly reduced by vaccination programs. In addition, new vaccines such as those for invasive meningococcal disease hold promise for an even brighter future. Although meningococcemia remains an important concern when evaluating a child with fever and a rash, the resurgence of measles, the emergence of invasive group A streptococcal disease and antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, as well as the fear of agents of bioterrorism (anthrax, smallpox) have changed the landscape of fever and rash in the 21st century. The purpose of this article is not to offer a comprehensive differential of febrile exanthema, but rather to highlight some new concerns related to the evaluation of fever and rash in today's emergency department.

### Diffuse erythema with... [^fec92a59]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

The exanthem of rubeola begins around the fourth febrile day, with discrete lesions that become confluent as they spread from the hairline downward, sparing the palms and soles. The exanthem typically lasts four to six days. The lesions fade gradually in order of appearance, leaving a residual yellow-tan coloration or faint desquamation. Rubeola is also distinguished by the presence of Koplik's spots in the oral mucosa. 1, 2 Erythema infectiosum, or fifth disease, is caused by human parvovirus B19. This disease primarily affects children between three and 12 years of age, although it can present as a rheumatic syndrome in adults. The prodrome may consist of fever, anorexia, sore throat and abdominal pain. Once the fever resolves, the classic bright-red facial rash appears. Within several days, the exanthem progresses to a diffuse, lacy, reticular rash that may wax and wane for six to eight weeks.

The illness is classified as minor or major, depending on severity. In erythema multiforme minor, bullae and systemic symptoms are absent. The eruption is typically confined to the extensor surfaces of extremities and only rarely involves the mucous membranes. Recurrent episodes of erythema multiforme minor usually precede an outbreak of herpes simplex by several days. Recurrences may be prevented with chronic acyclovir therapy. The rash begins as an erythematous maculopapular eruption that rapidly evolves to a vesicular rash. 21 In about 5 percent of patients, the rash may be accompanied by headache, malaise and fever. 1 Drying of the lesions with crust formation generally occurs in seven to 10 days, and the lesions usually resolve in 14 to 21 days.
20. . The course of erythema nodosum depends on the specific cause, but spontaneous resolution can be expected within six weeks.

1, 2 OTHER CAUSES In immunocompromised patients, disseminated fungal infections may produce nodular lesions. Disseminated candidiasis may present with diffuse nonerythematous nodules in an immunocompromised patient who has fever and myalgias. Other fungal infections to consider include cryptococcosis, blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis and sporotrichosis. 2.

Periodic fever is uncommon in children. The differential diagnosis is large, even though associated symptoms such as rash may help narrow the differential diagnosis. Atypical presentations require thoughtful evaluation. This article describes a case of a 4-year-old boy who presented to the emergency department with recurrent fever, vomiting, abdominal pain, myalgias, and rash. His hospital course is described along with a review on the background, evaluation, management, and complications of tumor necrosis receptor-1 alpha periodic syndrome.

### From telemedicine to the ICU-fever and rash in a 9-year-old girl [^4058f130]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

A 9-year-old girl presented to her primary care pediatrician via telemedicine during the initial months of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic because of 4 days of warmth perceived by her mother, decreased energy, and a new rash on her upper extremities. After 10 additional days of documented fever >38°C, worsening fatigue, and 1 day of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, she was allowed to schedule an in-person visit with her pediatrician after testing negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. She appeared ill on arrival to clinic, and her pediatrician recommended evaluation in an emergency department. Her initial laboratory testing revealed nonspecific elevation in several inflammatory markers and leukopenia, and she responded well to intravenous hydration. Over the next 2 weeks, her fever persisted, constitutional symptoms worsened, and she developed progressively painful cervical lymphadenopathy and pancytopenia. She was evaluated in clinic by several specialists and eventually was urged to present to the emergency department again, at which time she was admitted to the PICU. After consulting additional specialists and waiting for laboratory results, the team reached a definitive diagnosis and initiated therapy; however, she experienced rapid clinical decline shortly thereafter. The specialists who assisted with identification of the underlying etiology of her symptoms were able to work together to manage the subsequent complications.

### Fever, rash, and cough in a 7-year-old boy [^728b600e]. Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

A 7-year-old boy presented to the emergency department with fever, cough, congestion, abdominal pain, myalgias, and morbilliform rash. Several aspects of the patient's history, including recent travel, living on a farm, exposure to sick contacts, and new medications, resulted in a wide differential diagnosis. Initial laboratory testing revealed leukocytosis with neutrophilia and elevated atypical lymphocytes, but did not reveal any infectious causes of illness. He was discharged from the hospital, but then represented to the emergency department a day later with worsening rash, continued fever, abdominal pain, and poor intake. He was then admitted. A more comprehensive laboratory evaluation was initiated. During this hospital course, the patient's physical examination changed when he developed head and neck edema, and certain laboratory trends became clearer. With the assistance of several specialists, the team was able to reach a more definitive diagnosis and initiate treatment to appropriately manage his condition.

### Common skin rashes in children [^a92a51cb]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Because childhood rashes may be difficult to differentiate by appearance alone, it is important to consider the entire clinical presentation to help make the appropriate diagnosis. Considerations include the appearance and location of the rash; the clinical course; and associated symptoms, such as pruritus or fever. A fever is likely to occur with roseola, erythema infectiosum (fifth disease), and scarlet fever. Pruritus sometimes occurs with atopic dermatitis, pityriasis rosea, erythema infectiosum, molluscum contagiosum, and tinea infection. The key feature of roseola is a rash presenting after resolution of a high fever, whereas the distinguishing features in pityriasis rosea are a herald patch and a bilateral and symmetric rash in a Christmas tree pattern. The rash associated with scarlet fever usually develops on the upper trunk, then spreads throughout the body, sparing the palms and soles. Impetigo is a superficial bacterial infection that most commonly affects the face and extremities of children. Erythema infectiosum is characterized by a viral prodrome followed by the "slapped cheek" facial rash. Flesh-colored or pearly white papules with central umbilication occur with molluscum contagiosum, a highly contagious viral infection that usually resolves without intervention. Tinea is a common fungal skin infection in children that affects the scalp, body, groin, feet, hands, or nails. Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin condition that may present with a variety of skin changes.

### Common skin rashes in children | AAFP (...) [^4272cfb5]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Most children have a fever and sore throat one to two days before the rash develops on the upper trunk. The rash spreads throughout the body, sparing the palms and soles, with characteristic circumoral pallor. This differs from some viral exanthems that develop more slowly. The rash is characterized by confluent, erythematous, blanching, fine macules, resembling a sunburn, and sandpaper-like papules. Red strawberry tongue occurs after desquamation of the white coating. After several weeks, the rash fades and is followed by desquamation of the skin, especially on the face, in skin-folds, and on the hands and feet, potentially lasting four to six weeks. 9 With a sensitivity of 90% to 95%, throat culture is the first-choice method for diagnosis of group A streptococcal infection, but this is not always practical. Erythema Infectiosum Erythema infectiosum, or fifth disease, is caused by parvovirus B19.

It is a common childhood infection characterized by a prodrome of low-grade fever, malaise, sore throat, headache, and nausea followed several days later by an erythematous “slapped cheek” facial rash. . After two to four days, the facial rash fades. In the second stage of the disease process, pink patches and macules may develop in a lacy, reticular pattern, most often on the extremities. After one to six weeks, the rash resolves but may reappear with sun exposure, heat, or stress. Arthralgias occur in approximately 8% of young children with the disease but are much more common in teens and young adults. Patients are no longer considered infectious once the rash appears. Treatment is symptomatic and includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for arthralgias and antihistamines for pruritus.
13. The diagnosis of molluscum contagiosum is made clinically.

The condition is self-limited, but clinicians should advise parents to use gentle skin care products on the patient and that lesions may last for months or up to two to four years. Treatment options, including cryotherapy, imiquimod, and intralesional immunotherapy, are available if physical appearance is a concern. Dermatitis requires treatment to resolve pruritus and limit spread of the molluscum. 14.

### Rash decisions: an approach to dangerous rashes based on morphology [^7565e82b]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Rash is a common complaint in the emergency department. Many causes of rash are benign; however, some patients may have a life-threatening diagnosis.

Objective

This review will present an algorithmic approach to rashes, focusing on life-threatening causes of rash in each category.

Discussion

Rash is common, with a wide range of etiologies. The differential is broad, consisting of many conditions that are self-resolving. However, several conditions associated with rash are life threatening. Several keys can be utilized to rapidly diagnose and manage these deadly rashes. Thorough history and physical examination, followed by consideration of red flags, are essential. This review focuses on four broad categories based on visual and tactile characteristic patterns of rashes: petechial/purpuric, erythematous, maculopapular, and vesiculobullous. Rashes in each morphologic group will be further categorized based on clinical features such as the presence or absence of fever and distribution of skin lesions.

Conclusions

Rashes can be divided into petechial/purpuric, erythematous, maculopapular, and vesiculobullous. After this differentiation, the presence of fever and systemic signs of illness should be assessed. Through the breakdown of rashes into these classes, emergency providers can ensure deadly conditions are considered.

### Dermatologic emergencies-AAFP (...) [^739412c2]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever Key findings in patients with Rocky Mountain spotted fever include history of a tick bite, fever, and a characteristic rash. Between 60 and 75 percent of patients with this condition are given an alternate diagnosis at the initial physician visit.
13. DIAGNOSIS Clinical Findings. The diagnosis of Rocky Mountain spotted fever is primarily clinical. The classic triad of symptoms associated with the disease includes fever, headache, and rash in a person with a history of tick bite or exposure to ticks. 8 Patients also may present with nausea, vomiting, myalgia, anorexia, and severe abdominal pain. The rash appears two to five days after the onset of fever in 80 to 90 percent of patients. 9 Many patients present before the rash appears; therefore, a high index of suspicion is warranted in endemic areas when a patient presents with severe symptoms that mimic a viral illness.

The rash begins as small, blanching, nonpruritic macules that develop into a maculopapular rash and progress after several days to petechial lesions. The classic spotted appearance occurs when the petechial lesions coalesce and form ecchymosis. . 3 In later stages of the disease, the skin can become tender and desquamate. The early rash of Rocky Mountain spotted fever mimics many infectious and noninfectious diseases that have an associated maculopapular rash. 16 The petechial rash that occurs in Rocky Mountain spotted fever also occurs in other conditions 17. 1–12 It begins around the wrists and ankles and spreads to the palms and soles, eventually covering the extremities and trunk. The face is usually spared. A rash on the palms and soles is a distinct distribution that occurs in approximately 40 percent of patients with Rocky Mountain spotted fever. 9, 17 However, other exanthems can present with fever and rash on the palms and soles.

16 In patients with severe disease in whom treatment is delayed, complications can include cardiac and renal failure, meningitis, and pneumonitis. TREATMENT Treatment for Rocky Mountain spotted fever should begin immediately after diagnosis, and cases must be reported to the state health department. Patients treated more than five days after the onset of symptoms have a mortality rate three times greater than that in patients treated earlier.

Q fever—Acute clinical features in adults and children include that prolonged fever (>10 days) with a normal leukocyte count, thrombocytopenia, and increased liver enzymes is suggestive of acute Q fever infection. Children with Q fever generally have a milder acute illness than adults and are more likely to have a rash than adults, with rash reported in up to 50% of children with acute Q fever. Women infected with Q fever during pregnancy are at increased risk for miscarriage and preterm delivery, and women of child-bearing age who receive a diagnosis of Q fever can benefit from pregnancy screening and counseling to guide health-care management decisions.

### Pediatric recurrent fever and autoinflammation from the perspective of an allergist / immunologist [^c29c6637]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Autoinflammatory diseases are monogenic and polygenic disorders due to dysregulation of the innate immune system. The inherited conditions have been clustered with primary immunodeficiencies in the latest practice parameters; however, these diseases have unique clinical presentations, genetics, and available therapies. Given the presentation of fevers, rashes, and mucosal symptoms observed in many of these syndromes, patients are likely to present to an allergist/immunologist. Although there has been attention in the literature to diagnosis and treatment of rare, genetically defined autoinflammatory disorders, physicians are challenged by increasing numbers of patients with intermittent or periodic fevers who face unnecessary morbidities due to a lack of a diagnosis. The broad differential of diseases presenting with fever includes autoinflammatory syndromes, infections associated with immunodeficiency and/or allergies complicated by infection, and less commonly, autoimmune disorders or malignancy. To address this challenge, we review the history of the medical approach to fever, current diagnostic paradigms, and controversies in management. We describe the spectrum of disorders referred to a recurrent fever disorders clinic established in an Allergy/Immunology division at a tertiary pediatric care center. Finally, we provide practical recommendations including historical features and initial laboratory investigations that can help clinicians appropriately manage these patients.

### Rat-bite fever: an uncommon cause of fever and rash in a 9-year-old patient [^6970049f]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of fever, acral papulopustular rash, and arthralgias in an immunocompetent child include both systemic infections and inflammatory conditions. Lesions of chronic meningococcemia may be pustular and purpuric and are accompanied by fever and arthralgias. If there is concern for sexual abuse, disseminated gonorrhea and secondary syphilis should also be considered. Rocky Mountain spotted fever is characterized by fever, headache, and malaise followed by erythematous macules on the hands and feet, which may become purpuric or pustular.

Coxsackievirus infection may also present with fever, oral erosions, widespread edematous papules, and vesicopustules involving the hands, feet, perioral skin, and buttocks. Persistence of rash after 10 days argues against coxsackievirus in this case, as does the pustular (rather than vesicular) quality and location of the lesions. Varicella zoster virus lesions are vesicular rather than pustular and heal within 1 to 2 days with scarring. Noninfectious inflammatory conditions that should be considered include acute generalized pustular psoriasis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and bowel-associated dermatosis/arthritis syndrome.

### Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome [^b36c718b]. Pediatric Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) are characterized by apparently unprovoked attacks of fever, rashes, and musculoskeletal and sensorineural inflammation accompanied by high acute-phase reactants. Excessive interleukin-1 (IL-1) signaling appears to be a constant feature in the pathomechanism of the disease, driven by a gain-of-function mutation in the NLRP3 gene. Herein, we present the case of a 9-month-old boy with recurrent nonpruritic rashes and episodes of fever. The difficulties of early diagnosis due to initially mild clinical symptoms and the dramatic response to anti-IL-1 therapy after diagnosis emphasize the practical relevance of considering CAPS as a differential diagnosis in these patients.

### The rash with maculopapules and fever in adults [^bb8bbcf4]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

There is a broad differential diagnosis for the presentation of fever and maculopapular rash in an adult. Although some causative conditions are benign, others are medical emergencies that require prompt diagnosis. We describe various conditions that result in a fever and maculopapular rash in adults. These include infectious processes (meningococcemia, infectious mononucleosis, West Nile virus, zika virus, rubella, primary human immunodeficiency virus, parvovirus B19, ebolavirus), tick-borne illnesses (Rocky Mountain spotted fever, ehrlichiosis), and hypersensitivity reactions (exanthematous drug reactions). We also provide an algorithm to aid in the diagnosis of the patient with fever and maculopapular rash. Such conditions that can occur in adults but are seen predominantly in children are discussed in the article "Rash with maculopapules and fever in children" of this issue.

### Visual diagnosis: 12-month-old boy with persistent rash and lymphadenopathy [^57a85447]. Pediatrics in Review (2014). Low credibility.

Gianotti-Crosti syndrome (GCS) is a self-limiting, papular or papulovesicular, symmetric, acral exanthem that typically presents subsequent to viral infection, bacterial infection, or immunization in a child 1 to 4 years old. The rash can persist for 2 to 10 weeks. Recent infection with Epstein-Barr virus is the most common serologic finding in patients who have developed GCS. The diagnosis is often made after the child has been unsuccessfully treated for a more common cause of an acral rash (eg, scabies). There are no pathognomonic laboratory or histopathologic findings. GCS, therefore, is still a clinical diagnosis of exclusion. The rash is self-limited, and treatment is usually not necessary. However, topical corticosteroids are anecdotally reported to reduce duration of rash. Oral antihistamines can be used to treat pruritus. Parents should be assured that resolution is almost always complete, scarring seldom occurs, and recurrence is rare.

### Adverse reactions to vaccines practice parameter 2012 update [^17949d91]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2012). Medium credibility.

Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) and measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine (MMRV)—Transient rashes appear in as many as 5% of recipients of measles vaccine, and there is a late-onset fever occurring 5 to 12 days after vaccine administration in as many as 15% of recipients of the MMR vaccine. When the MMR is given in a combination vaccine with varicella, there is a 2-fold higher risk of febrile seizures than with separate injections at the same visit, quantified as one additional febrile seizure per 2500 children vaccinated. This increased risk exists only for the first dose, typically given between 12 and 15 months of age, and not for the second dose, typically given between 4 and 6 years of age, and the preferred strategy is separate MMR and varicella injections at the same visit for the first dose and the combined vaccine for the second dose. Rubella vaccine can cause acute arthritis in approximately 15% of adult women, and none of these events are contraindications to the administration of subsequent doses of MMR vaccine.

### Identification of a variant in NLRP3 gene in a patient with Muckle-Well's syndrome: a case report and review of literature [^21111c61]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

As we all know, fever is the most common clinical manifestation in children, and the causes are also diverse. Therefore, the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of fever in children is very challenging. Thus, clinically, children with recurrent fever, rash, musculoskeletal symptoms, and elevated inflammatory indicators, especially those with a positive family history, should be alert to the possibility of CAPS. If CAPS is suspected, the NLRP3 gene should be detected using molecular genetics for the presence of variations. If diagnosis is confirmed, the patients should be treated individually and closely followed up to prevent further organ damage and maximize the quality of life.

Assessment of clinical signs and symptoms—Acute Q fever in children is less likely to cause symptoms than in adults and may be milder, with symptomatic illness typically febrile and accompanied by headache, weakness, cough, and other nonspecific systemic symptoms; illness is frequently self-limited, though a relapsing febrile illness lasting for several months has been documented. Gastrointestinal symptoms are reported in 50%–80% of pediatric cases, and skin rash is more common than in adults with a prevalence as high as 50% among diagnosed children. Q fever pneumonia is usually moderate with mild cough; severe manifestations are rare but can include hepatitis, hemolytic uremic syndrome, myocarditis, pericarditis, encephalitis, meningitis, hemophagocytosis, lymphadenitis, acalculous cholecystitis, and rhabdomyolysis.

### Infant with a rapidly progressing rash [^b5c8a91e]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

An infant presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of rapidly progressing erythematous macules and distal oedema. The rash was striking in appearance, covering most of the body, which raised concern for pressing infectious (eg, meningococcaemia) and other serious aetiologies. Nevertheless, the infant remained playful and was overall stable and posed a diagnostic and management dilemma. After an extensive workup and multispecialty consultations, the patient was eventually diagnosed with acute haemorrhagic oedema of infancy, a benign leucocytoclastic vasculitis. The patient received no treatment and resolution of the rash occurred within 7 days of onset. Recognition of this condition and its benign nature can spare patients from an extensive workup and reduce anxiety for both family members and healthcare providers.

### The rash with maculopapules and fever in children [^dcb3d8d8]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Several medical conditions can cause children to present with fever and a maculopapular rash Although some presentations are benign, others may be medical emergencies, which warrant a prompt diagnosis. We review some of the more common causes of fever and maculopapular dermatitirs, rash including infectious processes (roseola; rubeola; rubella; parvovirus B19; hand, foot, and mouth disease; scarlet fever; meningococcemia; Epstein-Barr virus infection), hypersensitivity reactions (exanthematous drug reactions), and vasculitis syndromes (Kawasaki disease). We have included a diagnostic algorithm to facilitate rapid identification of the etiology of the rash and fever. Those conditions that can occur in children but are seen predominantly in adults are discussed in the contribution "Rash with maculopapules and fever in adults" in this issue.

### Viral exanthems [^4a615e49]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Determining the viral cause of a rash presents significant diagnostic challenges. We review contemporary literature on viral exanthems and suggest a structured approach to aid diagnosis.

Recent Findings

Strains responsible for, and the clinical presentation of, enteroviral infections have diverged from classic descriptions. The causative relationship between antibiotic administration and rash in Epstein-Barr virus infection has been recently questioned. Major measles virus outbreaks have recently occurred in Europe and the USA. The largest Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa has resulted in importation of the virus to other countries and secondary local transmission. Autochthonous transmission of Chikungunya virus has occurred in nonendemic areas, including Europe, the Caribbean and Americas. Zika virus has re-emerged in the Pacific with local transmission from imported cases. Climate change, global warming and spillover of zoonotic viruses are contributing to the emergence and spread of viral diseases.

Summary

Important clues to the diagnosis of viral exanthems include their distribution and morphology, geographic location and potential exposure to vector-borne or blood-borne viruses. Diagnosis is commonly made via serology, nucleic acid tests or, rarely, viral culture. Skin biopsy is not usually required. In general, viral exanthems are self-limiting and treatment is supportive.

Acute Q fever—key clinical features and pregnancy considerations: Prolonged fever (>10 days) with a normal leukocyte count, thrombocytopenia, and increased liver enzymes is suggestive of acute Q fever infection. Children with Q fever generally have a milder acute illness than adults, and rash is more common in children, with rash reported in up to 50% of children with acute Q fever. Women infected with Q fever during pregnancy are at increased risk for miscarriage and premature delivery, and women of child-bearing age who receive a diagnosis of Q fever can benefit from pregnancy screening and counseling to guide health-care management decisions.

### The generalized rash: part I. differential diagnosis [^36efc081]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Physicians often have difficulty diagnosing a generalized rash because many different conditions produce similar rashes, and a single condition can result in different rashes with varied appearances. A rapid and accurate diagnosis is critically important to make treatment decisions, especially when mortality or significant morbidity can occur without prompt intervention. When a specific diagnosis is not immediately apparent, it is important to generate an inclusive differential diagnosis to guide diagnostic strategy and initial treatment. In part I of this two-part article, tables listing common, uncommon, and rare causes of generalized rash are presented to help generate an inclusive differential diagnosis. The tables describe the key clinical features and recommended tests to help accurately diagnose generalized rashes. If the diagnosis remains unclear, the primary care physician must decide whether to observe and treat empirically, perform further diagnostic testing, or refer the patient to a dermatologist. This decision depends on the likelihood of a serious disorder and the patient's response to treatment.

### Rapidly progressive purpuric plaques in an infant [^456b68a0]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis? 
A. Erythema multiforme minor
B. Polyarteritis nodosa
C. Sweet Syndrome
D. Acute Hemorrhagic Edema of Infancy
E. Henoch-Schönlein purpura

Answers: 
A. Erythema multiforme minor – Incorrect. Erythema multiforme minor, a self-limited immune-mediated reaction to infections, is characterized by the acute onset of target, maculopapular lesions on extremities. It is not associated with edema of the face.
B. Polyarteritis nodosa – Incorrect. Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa is a leukocytoclastic medium-sized vessel vasculitis associated with cutaneous lesions such as livedo, subcutaneous nodules and annular purpura commonly on the arms and legs. Although cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa is the most common form in children, no subcutaneous nodules nor livedo were present here.
C. Sweet Syndrome – Incorrect. SS is characterized by acute purple and erythematous plaques on the face and extremities. Constitutional signs such as fever, malaise, arthralgia and leukocytosis, which are minor criteria for SS, were absent in this patient.
D. Acute Hemorrhagic Edema of Infancy – Correct. AHEI is a rare cutaneous vasculitis, seen in children between 4 and 24 months of age. Initially small erythematous papules or macules progress within 48 hours to sharply demarcated, targetoid, indurated purpuric plaques involving the face, the upper and lower extremities and sparing the trunk. The children appear otherwise well. AHEI is associated with facial edema and low-grade fever.
E. Henoch-Schönlein purpura – Incorrect. HSP and AHEI, both small-vessel vasculitis, have clinical and prognostic distinctive features. HSP mainly affects older children from 3 to 6 years of age,the palpable purpura in HSP is distributed on the buttocks and extensor surface of the legs, sparing the face.HSP’s diagnostic criteria include this characteristic rash and at least 1 other than skin system involvement; it may be associated with renal and gastrointestinal risks.

### Fever of unknown origin in childhood [^4817af30]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Childhood fever of unknown origin (FUO) is most often related to an underlying infection but can also be associated with a variety of neoplastic, rheumatologic, and inflammatory conditions. Repeated, focused reviews of patient history and physical examination are often helpful in suggesting a likely diagnosis. Diagnostic workup should be staged, usually leaving invasive testing for last. Advances in molecular genetic techniques have increased the importance of these assays in the diagnosis of FUO in children.

### A 14-year-old boy with neck pain, fevers, and diffuse erythematous rash [^384c1e3f]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

A previously healthy 14-year-old boy developed right-sided neck pain, tachycardia, a diffuse erythematous rash, and subjective fevers over 2 days. He sought medical attention in a local urgent care clinic, where he had a negative Sars-CoV-2 antigen test and was referred to the local emergency department (ED) for persistent tachycardia and further workup. After fluid resuscitation, his tachycardia was not improved, so he was admitted to the Pediatric Hospital Medicine Service. Physical examination showed large areas of erythema and erythroderma of multiple body sites, perioral sparing, increased erythema in flexor skin folds, posterior soft palate petechiae, and a white strawberry tongue. There was a small, tender lesion with surrounding erythema without discharge on his right neck thought to be a possible entry point for infection. Laboratory results showed thrombocytopenia, normal white blood cell count, normal hemoglobin concentration, absolute lymphopenia, and an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) to 130 mg/L. He was started on intravenous fluids and antibiotics for a presumed infectious cause of the rash and laboratory findings. The next morning, an expanded diagnostic workup was undertaken including electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, ferritin, triglycerides, liver enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), brain natriuretic peptide, coagulation studies, and fibrinogen. With treatment and supportive care, his tachycardia and energy improved, so he was discharged with oral antibiotics and follow-up with the Infectious Disease Clinic in 2 days. When seen in follow-up, he was immediately admitted to the hospital for worsening fatigue, tachycardia, and new findings that prompted multiple consultations, and transfer to pediatric critical care services.

### Rubella [^c65b8334]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Rubella is an acute illness caused by rubella virus and characterised by fever and rash. Although rubella is a clinically mild illness, primary rubella virus infection in early pregnancy can result in congenital rubella syndrome, which has serious medical and public health consequences. WHO estimates that approximately 100000 congenital rubella syndrome cases occur per year. Rubella virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets and direct contact. 25-50% of people infected with rubella virus are asymptomatic. Clinical disease often results in mild, self-limited illness characterised by fever, a generalised erythematous maculopapular rash, and lymphadenopathy. Complications include arthralgia, arthritis, thrombocytopenic purpura, and encephalitis. Common presenting signs and symptoms of congenital rubella syndrome include cataracts, sensorineural hearing impairment, congenital heart disease, jaundice, purpura, hepatosplenomegaly, and microcephaly. Rubella and congenital rubella syndrome can be prevented by rubella-containing vaccines, which are commonly administered in combination with measles vaccine. Although global rubella vaccine coverage reached only 70% in 2020 global rubella eradiation remains an ambitious but achievable goal.

### Rat-bite fever: an uncommon cause of fever and rash in a 9-year-old patient [^c0e21023]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Rat-bite fever (RBF) is most commonly caused by Streptobacillus moniliformis and is usually transmitted by a bite or close contact from a colonized rat. Less often, RBF may be transmitted by ingestion of contaminated food or water.The disease is characterized by relapsing fever, migratory polyarthritis, and a rash that often involves the extremities, including the palms and soles.The diagnosis of RBF is challenging, as clinical and laboratory findings are nonspecific. We report a case of a 9-year-old girl presenting with intermittent fever and nonspecific symptoms who was ultimately diagnosed with RBF via a novel method.

Measles—clinical presentation and complications—The incubation period averages 11–12 days from exposure to onset of prodrome, and rash usually appears approximately 14 days after exposure; prodromal symptoms can include fever with temperature ≤40.6°C (≤105°F). A characteristic maculopapular rash appears 3–7 days after prodromal onset, begins on the face, becomes generalized to the trunk and extremities, and typically lasts 4–7 days. Common complications include diarrhea (8%), middle ear infection (7%–9%), and pneumonia (1%–6%). Encephalitis occurs in approximately 1 per 1,000–2,000 cases of measles, and approximately 25% of patients with acute measles require hospitalization. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis usually presents 7–10 years after recovery from primary infection and occurs in approximately 7–11 per 100,000 reported measles cases, with higher rates among children infected at <2 years of age.

### A 2-year-old with 4 weeks of daily fever [^628afafa]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

A 2-year-old female presents for evaluation of 4 weeks of daily fevers. When the fevers began, she had mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, which quickly resolved. The fevers persisted, however, with a maximum of 40°C. The child's review of symptoms was significant for a 1-kg weight loss over the past month. Ten months before presentation, she had moved from Saudi Arabia with her family. One week before the onset of symptoms, she had visited a petting zoo. During episodes of fever, the patient was ill-appearing and had an elevated heart rate and respiratory rate. On examination, she was found to be thin, febrile, tachycardic, and with scattered lymphadenopathy. Results of laboratory tests were remarkable for an elevated white blood cell count of 16,100 cells per uL with a neutrophilic predominance. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were elevated at 99 mm/h and 27 mg/dL, respectively. A chest radiograph indicated a small amount of fluid in the interlobar fissures. Our expert panel examines her case, offers a definition of fever of unknown origin, and makes diagnostic considerations.

### Heterogeneity in the evaluation of suspected MIS-C: a cross-sectional vignette-based survey [^71198b42]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) is an emerging complication of COVID-19 which lacks a definitive diagnostic test and evidence-based guidelines for workup. We sought to assess practitioners' preferences when initiating a workup for pediatric patients presenting with symptoms concerning for MIS-C.

Methods

In a cross-sectional vignette-based survey, providers were presented with clinical vignettes of a patient presenting with 24 h of fever from a community with high rates of COVID-19. Respondents were asked about their general practices in pursuing a workup for potential MIS-C including testing obtained, criteria for diagnosis, and timing to confirm or rule out the diagnosis.

Results

Most of the 174 respondents were physicians from the United States at academic medical centers. The majority of providers would not initiate MIS-C workup for fever and non-specific symptoms unless the fever lasted more than 72 h. Skin rash, abdominal pain, and shortness of breath were symptoms that raised greatest concern for MIS-C. Most providers would obtain COVID-19 PCR or antigen testing, plus blood work, in the initial workup. The list of laboratory studies providers would obtain is extensive. Providers primarily rely on cardiac involvement to confirm a MIS-C diagnosis, and establishing a diagnosis takes 24–48 h.

Conclusions

Significant heterogeneity exists amongst providers as to when to initiate the MIS-C workup, the order and content of the workup, and how to definitively diagnose MIS-C. A diagnostic test with high sensitivity and specificity for MIS-C and refined evidence-based guidelines are needed to expedite diagnosis and treatment.

Meningococcal disease—clinical presentation and course generally occurs 1–10 days after exposure, with meningitis in approximately 50% of cases in the United States, approximately 30% presenting with meningococcemia, and an additional 15% in the United States, primarily among adults >65 years of age, presenting as bacteremic pneumonia; among infants and children aged <2 years, symptoms can be nonspecific and neck stiffness might be absent. Meningococcemia can include abrupt onset of fever, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, and a petechial or purpuric rash which can progress to purpura fulminans, and often involves hypotension, acute adrenal hemorrhage, and multiorgan failure. The disease progresses rapidly with a case-fatality rate of 10%–15% even with antimicrobial drug treatment, and up to 20% of survivors can have long-term health effects such as deafness or amputations due to necrosis of the extremities.

### Efavirenz [^a00ba1e5]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.8 Rash

In controlled clinical trials, 26% (266/1008) of adult patients treated with 600 mg efavirenz experienced new-onset skin rash compared with 17% (111/635) of those treated in control groups [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Rash associated with blistering, moist desquamation, or ulceration occurred in 0.9% (9/1008) of patients treated with efavirenz. The incidence of Grade 4 rash (e.g., erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome) in adult patients treated with efavirenz in all studies and expanded access was 0.1%. Rashes are usually mild-to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions that occur within the first 2 weeks of initiating therapy with efavirenz (median time to onset of rash in adults was 11 days) and, in most patients continuing therapy with efavirenz, rash resolves within 1 month (median duration, 16 days). The discontinuation rate for rash in adult clinical trials was 1.7% (17/1008).

Rash was reported in 59 of 182 pediatric patients (32%) treated with efavirenz [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Two pediatric patients experienced Grade 3 rash (confluent rash with fever, generalized rash), and four patients had Grade 4 rash (erythema multiforme). The median time to onset of rash in pediatric patients was 28 days (range 3-1642 days). Prophylaxis with appropriate antihistamines before initiating therapy with efavirenz in pediatric patients should be considered.

Efavirenz can generally be reinitiated in patients interrupting therapy because of rash. Efavirenz should be discontinued in patients developing severe rash associated with blistering, desquamation, mucosal involvement, or fever. Appropriate antihistamines and/or corticosteroids may improve the tolerability and hasten the resolution of rash. For patients who have had a life-threatening cutaneous reaction (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome), alternative therapy should be considered [see Contraindications (4)].

### Diagnosis and management of tickborne rickettsial diseases: rocky mountain spotted fever and other spotted fever group rickettsioses, ehrlichioses, and anaplasmosis-United States [^f44d06dc]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) pathophysiology and clinical presentation—timing, rash features, and diagnostic cautions—include that symptoms of RMSF typically appear 3–12 days after the bite of an infected tick or between the fourth and eighth day after discovery of an attached tick, and the incubation period is generally shorter (5 days or less) in patients who develop severe disease. Initial symptoms include sudden onset of fever, headache, chills, malaise, and myalgia, and other early symptoms might include nausea or vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia, and photophobia. A rash typically appears 2–4 days after the onset of fever, and the classic triad of fever, rash, and reported tick bite is present in only a minority of patients during initial presentation; therefore, health care providers should not wait for development of this triad before considering a diagnosis of RMSF. The RMSF rash classically begins as small (1–5 mm in diameter), blanching pink macules on the ankles, wrists, or forearms that subsequently spread and the classic spotted or generalized petechial rash usually appears by day 5 or 6 and is indicative of advanced disease. Absence of rash should not preclude consideration of RMSF; ≤ 50% of patients have a rash in the first 3 days of illness, children aged <15 years more frequently have a rash than older patients, and unlike some SFG rickettsioses, an inoculation eschar is rarely present with RMSF. Rickettsia rickettsii primarily infects vascular endothelial cells leading to systemic vasculitis; pathogen-mediated endothelial injury results in increased capillary permeability, microhemorrhage, and platelet consumption, with late-stage manifestations including noncardiogenic pulmonary edema (acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]) and cerebral edema, and hyponatremia occurs as a result of appropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone in response to hypovolemia; if disease progresses untreated, it can result in end-organ damage associated with severe morbidity and death.

Assessment of clinical signs and symptoms—Acute Q fever in adults occurs symptomatically in approximately half of infected persons and, after an incubation period of 2–3 weeks, most commonly presents as a nonspecific febrile illness that might occur with pneumonia or hepatitis. In North America in the 1980s, among 1,306 hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia cases, 30 cases (2.3%) were acute Q fever, and cough is often nonproductive in 50% of patients. Fever in untreated patients lasts a median of 10 days (range: 5–57 days), with the majority defervescing within 72 hours of doxycycline; duration increases with age, with 60% of patients aged >40 years having fever >14 days compared with 29% aged <40 years. Rash occurs in 5%–21% of patients. Mortality is <2%, and during the Netherlands outbreak of approximately 4,000 reported cases up to 50% of acute Q fever patients were hospitalized. Common diagnostic coding in one U.S. military series included fever, not otherwise specified (780.6); pneumonia, organism unspecified (486); and viral infection, not otherwise specified (079.99).

### Unusual acral bullous dyshidrosiform rash associated with acute human herpes virus-6 infection in a 2-year-old girl [^4ff80018]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is a common virus that primarily affects young children. It typically causes roseola infantum, which is characterized by a high fever followed by a transient maculopapular rash. Rarely, HHV-6 infection can lead to atypical dermatologic manifestations.Here, we present the case of a two-year-old girl who developed a dyshidrosiform rash on her hands after experiencing an acute HHV-6 infection.

### Unusual acral bullous dyshidrosiform rash associated with acute human herpes virus-6 infection in a 2-year-old girl [^8156ed31]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

HHV-6 is known to cause roseola infantum, a common childhood illness characterized by a high fever followed by a rash.However, the development of a dyshidrosiform rash is atypical. Acute HHV-6 or HHV-7 infections can present with atypical manifestations, including acral involvement, as documented in existing literature in adults.The pathogenesis of this palmoplantar vesiculobullous eruption is unclear; however, some observations support a virus-mediated mechanism. Transcriptomic profiling of vesicular hand eczema shows marked upregulation of innate host-defense genes and downregulation of epidermal differentiation markers. This suggests that exaggerated innate immunity can promote intraepidermal vesiculation.In this context, HHV-6 infection may act as a trigger by directly infecting epithelial and immune cells or by promoting local immune dysregulation. HHV-6 exhibits broad cellular tropism, including keratinocytes, dendritic cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, which supports its potential for direct cutaneous involvement. Additionally, the virus modulates host immunity by inducing proinflammatory cytokines (eg, interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-α) and expressing proteins (eg, U21 and U24) that interfere with antigen presentation and T cell signaling.These combined effects, direct epithelial involvement and immune-mediated inflammation, may lead to vesiculation, even in immunocompetent children. The relative immaturity of the epidermal barrier in early childhood may further amplify these mechanisms, predisposing individuals to bullous changes.

### Unusual purpuric eruption in a child [^d5bf2d2c]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

A 5-year-old, previously healthy girl presented with new-onset, persistent, red, burning hives covering large segments of her body. Associated symptoms included angioedema, shortness of breath, and diarrhea. The lesions resolved after 24 hours, leaving behind areas of bruising. On physical examination, the patient appeared well, with scattered, variably sized, purpuric patches and urticarial plaques on the torso and extremities (Fig 1, Fig 2, Fig 3). Laboratory evaluation revealed leukocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, normal C1q antibody levels, and decreased C4 levels. Two weeks after the initial presentation, she developed the same purpuric eruption accompanied by acute hypoxic respiratory failure.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Morbilliform drug eruption
B. Irritant contact dermatitis
C. Cutaneous metastasis of internal malignancy
D. Erysipelas
E. Herpes zoster

Answers: 
A. Morbilliform drug eruption – Incorrect. Morbilliform drug eruption is typically bilateral and symmetric upon presentation. It is commonly caused by recently started antibiotics but may be caused by initiation of multiple classes of drugs. Onset is typically within 4 weeks of beginning a new medication, making this answer less likely, as this patient had been on the same chemotherapy regimen for greater than 6 months.
B. Irritant contact dermatitis – Incorrect. The clinical manifestations of irritant contact dermatitis range from mild skin dryness and erythema to acute or chronic eczematous dermatitis and even skin necrosis. This patient did not report exposure to chemical or physical irritants.
C. Cutaneous metastasis of internal malignancy – Correct. Cutaneous metastases can display a wide morphologic spectrum of appearance in various locations, which is why in a patient with history of recent malignancy, a new rash located on the trunk should raise suspicion for a cutaneous metastasis. See Fig 2 for biopsy results of this lesion. This variable clinical morphology includes nodules, papules, plaques, tumors, and ulcers. Lung cancer commonly metastasizes to the head, neck, and trunk.Cutaneous metastases occur in 0.7% to 0.9% of all patients with cancer.
D. Erysipelas – Incorrect. Erysipelas manifests as areas of skin erythema, edema, and warmth and develops as a result of bacterial entry via breaches in the skin barrier. This rash is sometimes accompanied by symptoms including a high fever of sudden onset with chills, and most cases affect the lower leg, ankle, or foot. This patient's rash slowly progressed over 4 weeks, unlike erysipelas, which develops more acutely and involves desquamation of the skin 5 to 10 days after onset.
E. Herpes zoster – Incorrect. Although this patient fits the age group that is commonly affected with herpes zoster, this patient's rash does not fit clinically. The rash starts as erythematous papules, typically in a single dermatome or several contiguous dermatomes and evolves into grouped vesicles or bullae. This patient's rash does somewhat follow along contiguous dermatomes, but does not consist of papules or vesicles as you would expect with herpes zoster.

### A 6-year-old boy with fever, rash and severe pneumonia [^c7ac92d6]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

The authors report a 6-year-old boy with fever, rash and cough. He was diagnosed with severe measles pneumonia and admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit with severe dyspnoea 8 days after symptom onset. He received intravenous antibiotics and high dose vitamin A. Three days later, he had recovered and was discharged home. He had not been vaccinated for measles, mumps and rubella according to the schedule. This case highlights the need for rapid diagnosis, appropriate treatment and determination of vaccination status of children with measles in order to prevent complications.

Clinical factors impacting workup preferences for MIS-C

We then sought to determine patient-specific differences that would affect practitioners’ preferences in the MIS-C workup. First, we assessed how the workup would differ based on the child's age. For younger children, practitioners were more likely to obtain blood work than older children, who were more likely to be watched clinically (Fig. 4).

Providers’ Preferred Workup Based on Patient’s Age. Providers were asked how the initial workup would differ in a patient with concern for MIS-C based on their age

Providers were then asked to rank the top three presenting features, besides fever, that would make them most concerned about MIS-C in a pediatric patient with persistent fever for more than 48 h. Skin rash (n = 61, 35%), abdominal pain (n = 58, 33%), and shortness of breath (n = 46, 26%) were the most cited symptoms that raised provider concern for MIS-C (Fig. 5).

### Fever in the pediatric patient [^e4ce58e2]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Fever is the most common reason that children and infants are brought to emergency departments. Emergency physicians face the challenge of quickly distinguishing benign from life-threatening conditions. The management of fever in children is guided by the patient's age, immunization status, and immune status as well as the results of a careful physical examination and appropriate laboratory tests and radiographic views. In this article, the evaluation and treatment of children with fevers of known and unknown origin are described. Causes of common and dangerous conditions that include fever in their manifestation are also discussed.

### Causes of morbilliform rash in a highly immunised english population [^b9ec6d03]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

To determine the causes of morbilliform rash and fever in a population with high vaccination coverage for measles and rubella.

Methods

Comprehensive laboratory investigation additional to routine oral fluid testing of children presenting to primary care physicians in East Anglia, England.

Results

Laboratory confirmation of infection was obtained in 93 (48%) of 195 children: parvovirus B19 in 34 (17%); group A streptococcus in 30 (15%); human herpesvirus type 6 in 11 (6%); enterovirus in nine (5%); adenovirus in seven (4%); and group C streptococcus in six (3%) (four individuals tested positive for two agents). None had measles or rubella.

Conclusions

Oral fluid testing to cover infections additional to measles and rubella aids clinical management and is likely to maintain uptake of testing, which is essential for measles and rubella surveillance in highly immunised low incidence populations.

### Unilateral laterothoracic exanthem in association with coronavirus disease 2019 [^4441237e]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Given the right-sided predominance and flexural distribution, this rash is most consistent with a unilateral laterothoracic exanthem (UTLE). UTLE is typically characterized by a unilateral, periflexural exanthema that often involves the axillae and spreads to the contralateral side over time.Individual cases of UTLE in association with Epstein Barr virus and parvovirus B19 have been reported.UTLE is typically preceded by nonspecific systemic symptoms, including low-grade fever, diarrhea, or rhinitis. Although most often seen in children, UTLE can affect adults.

The differential diagnosis in this patient with known SARS-CoV-2 infection included viral exanthema and exanthematous drug eruption. However, UTLE has not been associated with medications. Although acetaminophen is a rare cause of exanthematous drug eruptions, the time course of this eruption after 2 days of medication administration and resolution while on acetaminophen would be exceedingly quick. The morphology of the rash could be consistent with symmetric drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema but the patient's rash improved while she was on acetaminophen, making this diagnosis much less likely. Many cases of UTLE are initially mistaken for contact dermatitis because of the unusual distribution. Pathology of UTLE is nonspecific, similar to viral exanthem and exanthematous drug eruption, and typically shows mild spongiosis with variable lymphocytic perivascular infiltrates. UTLE typically self-resolves with supportive care within 3 to 6 weeks without recurrence.

### Recurrent pediatric acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis with drug and infective precipitants [^8560f93b]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Case details

An 11-year-old Chinese girl with a history of exogenous obesity presented initially with 2-days of a generalized pruritic rash preceded by 4 days of diarrhea and vomiting. On examination, disseminated non-follicular pinhead-sized pustules were seen over the trunk and limbs on a background of oedematous erythema (Fig 1) with no mucosal involvement. Investigations revealed neutrophilic leukocytosis and elevated inflammatory markers, though her renal and liver functions were normal. No infectious organism was isolated. Drug history was unrevealing for new medications. She was diagnosed clinically with AGEP triggered by gastroenteritis of possible viral origin and was treated with mometasone furoate 0.1% lotion and emollients. She made an uneventful recovery with collarette desquamation in 2 weeks. The patient experienced second similar pustular eruption 11 months later over her face and trunk 1-day after the ingestion of dimenhydrinate for motion-sickness while on a vacation. The rash resolved with cessation of the drug without further intervention within 7 days. A third episode occurred 3 months after the second, where she presented again with a similar cutaneous eruption over the face, neck, limbs and trunk, preceded by rhinorrhea and fever for 1 week. Enterovirus/Rhinovirus and Adenovirus were isolated from a respiratory swab and no new medication was ingested during this period. A fourth episode occurred 5 months later again preceded by Enterovirus/Rhinovirus swab-positive upper respiratory tract symptoms for 2 weeks prior and the intake of diphenhydramine, tripolidine, and pseudoephedrine 1day prior to the onset of her rash. As her fourth episode was more temporally related with her drug intake, Diphenhydramine was deemed the likely causative agent, rather than a parainfectious trigger. This was further supported by the patient’s previous history of AGEP from dimenhydrinate, which is metabolized into the active ingredient diphenhydramine for antiemetic efficacy. The clinical features of each episode are highlighted in Table I. She was diagnosed with recurrent AGEP – 2 episodes triggered by infections and 2 episodes triggered by drugs (dimenhydrinate and diphenhydramine) within the span of 2 years. In all 4 episodes, the patient made an uneventful recovery with topical steroids and emollients, with postpustular desquamation observed by 14 days in all 4 episodes. She was symptom-free between episodes.

### The rash with mucosal ulceration [^45016647]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

A rash is a disseminated eruption of cutaneous lesions with great variation in appearance, cause, and severity. When the physician is facing a rash, the history and physical examination of the patient are extremely important for the identification of the disease and its causal agent. There are various causes for a rash, which may be infectious, allergic, or rheumatologic, besides many others. Rashes associated with mucosal ulcers may have causes related to viral and bacterial infections or drug reactions. They may be associated with measles; erythema infectiosum; roseola infantum; rubella; hand, foot, and mouth disease; pityriasis rosea; dengue fever; chikungunya; zika; scarlet fever; meningococcal diseases; syphilis; and exanthematous drug eruptions.

### Recurrent rash in an 11-year-old boy with pericardial and pleural effusions [^3f06e32c]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

An 11-year-old, previously healthy boy presented to the emergency center (EC) for acute respiratory distress in the setting of 5 months of recurrent and worsening rash with progressive fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, and cough. At the onset of his rash, he and his younger brothers were diagnosed with roseola. Although his brothers' symptoms resolved, the patient's rash recurred, prompting his primary care provider to prescribe amoxicillin. The rash subsequently worsened, so amoxicillin was stopped; a prednisone course was prescribed which alleviated the rash. Upon completion of the prednisone course, the rash returned more diffusely with associated symptoms of shortness of breath, chest pain, and cough. Because of these symptoms, his mother brought him to the EC, where his vitals were notable for tachypnea and tachycardia. His initial EC imaging workup was remarkable for an echocardiogram with a mild to moderate circumferential pericardial effusion, chest x-ray (CXR) with a large right pleural effusion, and chest computerized tomography significant for prominent and diffuse mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy with numerous enlarged axillary lymph nodes. Laboratory results were notable for elevated liver enzymes, inflammatory markers, d-dimer, and brain natriuretic peptide. Differential diagnosis remained broad, including infectious, oncologic, and rheumatologic etiologies. Our panel of experts reviews the evaluation, hospital course, and treatment of this patient presenting with an unusual rash and serositis.

### Chromosomally integrated human herpesvirus 6: questions and answers [^754f3f35]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2012). Low credibility.

What is human herpesvirus 6?

Human herpesvirus 6 is the collective name for HHV-6A and HHV-6B, which are two closely related herpesviruses that have a combined seroprevalence of >90% in adults. HHV-6B is typically transmitted via saliva and primary infection usually occurs between 6 months and 2–3 years of age. Many primary HHV-6B infections are not associated with any specific clinical features, although the virus causes roseola infantum (exanthema subitum or sixth disease) in ~30% of children, presenting with high-grade fever followed by a characteristic rash that is sometimes accompanied by benign febrile convulsions, and rarely by status epilepticus. Little is known about primary HHV-6A infection and its disease associations. For the 99% of the population without ciHHV-6, most become infected with the virus in the first 2 years of life, with the virus establishing latency in a small fraction of mononuclear cells.

Disease associated with HHV-6A and HHV-6B reactivations can occur in immunocompromised hosts, and rarely in immunocompetent individuals. HHV-6B reactivation often occurs in immunocompetent individuals during drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS) and the related drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). Symptoms and conditions that have been firmly associated with HHV-6B in immunocompromised patients include exanthematous rash, fever, seizures 2005, encephalopathy 2009, limbic encephalitis 2007 and amnesia, cognitive dysfunction 2011, lymphadenopathy 2004, colitis, and hepatitis. Less well established, and in some cases controversial associations have been reported for Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS) 2010, renal failure, hemophagocytic syndrome, myocarditis, pneumonitis, hypogammaglobulinemia 2004, and arteriopathies. HHV-6A reactivation has been found in subsets of patients with multiple sclerosis, HIV infection, encephalitis 2007, and syncytial giant-cell hepatitis 2008 (reviewed in). The vast majority of low-level HHV-6 reactivations in immunocompromised patients are asymptomatic.

5.7 Rash

In controlled clinical trials, 26% (266/1008) of patients treated with 600 mg SUSTIVA experienced new-onset skin
rash compared with 17% (111/635) of patients treated in control groups [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, Table 5)]. Rash associated with blistering, moist desquamation, or ulceration occurred
in 0.9% (9/1008) of patients treated with SUSTIVA. The incidence of Grade 4 rash (eg, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome) in patients treated
with SUSTIVA in all studies and expanded access was 0.1%. Rashes are usually mild-to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions that occur within the first
2 weeks of initiating therapy with efavirenz (median time to onset of rash in adults was 11 days) and, in most patients continuing therapy with efavirenz,
rash resolves within 1 month (median duration, 16 days). The discontinuation rate for rash in clinical trials was 1.7% (17/1008). SUSTIVA can be reinitiated
in patients interrupting therapy because of rash. SUSTIVA should be discontinued in patients developing severe rash associated with blistering, desquamation,
mucosal involvement, or fever. Appropriate antihistamines and/or corticosteroids may improve the tolerability and hasten the resolution of rash. For patients who have had a life-threatening cutaneous reaction (eg, Stevens-Johnson syndrome), alternative therapy should be considered [see also Contraindications (4.1)].

Rash was reported in 26 of 57 pediatric patients (46%) treated with SUSTIVA capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]. One pediatric patient experienced Grade 3 rash (confluent rash with fever), and two patients had Grade 4 rash (erythema multiforme). The median time to onset of rash in pediatric patients was 8 days. Prophylaxis with appropriate antihistamines before initiating therapy with SUSTIVA in pediatric patients should be considered.

### Pruritic postoperative eruption [^ffa0e212]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the best next step in the management of this patient? 
A. Oral prednisone
B. Supportive care
C. Oral antihistamines and reassurance
D. Topical antibiotics
E. Methotrexate

Answers: 
A. Oral prednisone – Correct. Corticosteroids are the first-line therapeutic option in the management of Sweet syndrome, with most patients showing rapid clinical response. In fact, improvement with systemic corticosteroids is included in the diagnostic criteria for Sweet syndrome.Topical or intralesional corticosteroids may be considered in patients with localized disease. Alternative first-line therapeutic options include colchicine, dapsone, and potassium iodide. Our patient showed rapid improvement with 60 mg daily of oral prednisone, with near-complete resolution of her rash and pruritus at 2-week follow-up.
B. Supportive care – Incorrect. Supportive care is the mainstay of management for Stevens-Johnson syndrome, but pharmacologic therapy is indicated in the treatment of Sweet syndrome.
C. Oral antihistamines and reassurance – Incorrect. Although drug-induced Sweet syndrome may improve following discontinuation of the offending medication, antihistamines and reassurance alone would not be appropriate. Oral antihistamines may be used for symptomatic relief, but further pharmacologic therapy is indicated.
D. Topical antibiotics – Incorrect. Postoperative infection and bacterial sepsis are important initial considerations in the differential diagnosis of this patient with fever, rash, and leukocytosis following surgery. Empiric intravenous vancomycin and cefepime were administered until the correct diagnosis of Sweet syndrome was established. In this situation of a systemic illness, topical antibiotic therapy is not indicated.
E. Methotrexate – Incorrect. Methotrexate has been used with success in refractory cases of Sweet syndrome. However, it is not a first-line treatment option.

### Measles [^59509540]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Measles is a highly contagious disease that results from infection with measles virus and is still responsible for more than 100000 deaths every year, down from more than 2 million deaths annually before the introduction and widespread use of measles vaccine. Measles virus is transmitted by the respiratory route and illness begins with fever, cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis followed by a characteristic rash. Complications of measles affect most organ systems, with pneumonia accounting for most measles-associated morbidity and mortality. The management of patients with measles includes provision of vitamin A. Measles is best prevented through vaccination, and the major reductions in measles incidence and mortality have renewed interest in regional elimination and global eradication. However, urgent efforts are needed to increase stagnating global coverage with two doses of measles vaccine through advocacy, education, and the strengthening of routine immunisation systems. Use of combined measles-rubella vaccines provides an opportunity to eliminate rubella and congenital rubella syndrome. Ongoing research efforts, including the development of point-of-care diagnostics and microneedle patches, will facilitate progress towards measles elimination and eradication.

### A young boy with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis presenting with vaccine-related granulomatous dermatitis: a case report and literature review [^da8d3e0b]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Cutaneous eruptions associated with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) have been reported in 6%-63% of patients. Clinical findings of these skin lesions vary widely and include maculopapular rashes, ulcers, and violaceous nodules. Corresponding histologic findings are also variable and are considered nonspecific. We report the case of a 4-year-old boy who initially developed a widespread popular-pustular rash 2 weeks after his 12-month measles, mumps, and rubella vaccinations. These resolved with scarring then recurred following his 24-month vaccinations. Multiple skin biopsies were negative for infectious organisms and showed a granulomatous infiltrate with perforation and necrobiosis. The differential diagnosis included perforating granuloma annulare, infection, or rheumatoid nodules. At the age of 4, he developed fever, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia and other laboratory abnormalities, requiring hospitalization. A number of studies were performed including biopsies of bone marrow and liver. Molecular testing revealed 2 mutations in UNC13D known to be associated with familial HLH. His prior cutaneous lesions were likely caused by immune dysregulation exacerbated by immunizations because of underlying familial HLH. This case illustrates the importance of recognizing an unusual cutaneous manifestation of a rare disease to arrive at an earlier diagnosis in a pediatric patient. Although cutaneous eruptions usually develop concurrently with other systemic symptoms of HLH, preceding unusual skin lesions may be the first indication of this rare disease.

### SHEA practice update: infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^063d38c8]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). High credibility.

Measles—background for infection prevention in residential facilities describes a highly contagious viral infection spread when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks, with infection occurring by breathing contaminated air (the virus stays in the air for up to two hours) or by touching a contaminated surface and then the eyes, noses, or mouths. Measles commonly presents with fever, cough, nasal congestion, conjunctivitis (pink eye), and a red rash that begins on the face then spreads to the entire body, and complications can include ear infections, pneumonia, croup, hepatitis, encephalitis, and diarrhea. Individuals are contagious from 4 days before the onset of rash through 4 days after the rash appears. Measles remains a leading cause of childhood disease and death globally, with recent outbreaks due to importation by travelers and infections in individuals who are immunized incompletely.

Rickettsial diseases in travelers—clinical presentations and red flags are outlined for African tick bite fever, scrub typhus, murine typhus, ehrlichiosis/anaplasmosis, and sennetsu fever. African tick bite fever is typically milder than other spotted fever group rickettsioses, and it should be suspected in a patient who presents with fever, headache, myalgia, and an eschar after recent travel to Sub-Saharan Africa or the Caribbean; regional lymphadenopathy is also common, and many patients may not remember a tick bite and not all will present with eschars. Scrub typhus presents with fever, headache, and myalgia; lymphadenopathy, respiratory symptoms, encephalitis, and eschars may also occur, with respiratory symptoms present in approximately two-thirds of patients and severity ranging from mild cough to acute respiratory distress syndrome; scrub typhus can be fatal if not treated appropriately. Patients with murine typhus usually present with a moderately severe but often otherwise non-specific febrile illness; approximately half of patients will develop a maculopapular rash, generally appearing on the trunk, and the fever can persist for up to 2 weeks in the absence of treatment; although generally less severe than Rocky Mountain spotted fever or scrub typhus, patients can develop organ failure or require hospitalization, and death can occur in some cases. Ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis also present as a non-specific febrile illness and are less commonly reported in travelers; cytopenias, particularly leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, are common and should heighten suspicion, and rash may be seen in some children with ehrlichiosis, but rash is not a feature of anaplasmosis. Sennetsu fever presents with fever, weakness, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly, resembling infectious mononucleosis, and although rarely reported in endemic regions, serologic evidence suggests it may be an underrecognized cause of fever in these regions.

### Rufinamide [^cf336ca6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Multi-organ Hypersensitivity/Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)

Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as multi-organ hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including rufinamide. DRESS may be fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and/or lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis, sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident.  Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved.

All cases of DRESS identified in clinical trials with rufinamide occurred in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age, occurred within 4 weeks of treatment initiation, and resolved or improved with rufinamide discontinuation. DRESS has also been reported in adult and pediatric patients taking rufinamide in the postmarketing setting.

If DRESS is suspected, the patient should be evaluated immediately, rufinamide should be discontinued, and alternative treatment should be started.

5.5 Withdrawal of AEDs

As with all antiepileptic drugs, rufinamide should be withdrawn gradually to minimize the risk of precipitating seizures, seizure exacerbation, or status epilepticus. If abrupt discontinuation of the drug is medically necessary, the transition to another AED should be made under close medical supervision. In clinical trials, rufinamide discontinuation was achieved by reducing the dose by approximately 25% every 2 days.

5.6 Status Epilepticus

Estimates of the incidence of treatment emergent status epilepticus among patients treated with rufinamide are difficult because standard definitions were not employed. In a controlled Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome trial, 3 of 74 (4.1%) rufinamide-treated patients had episodes that could be described as status epilepticus in the rufinamide-treated patients compared with none of the 64 patients in the placebo-treated patients. In all controlled trials that included patients with different epilepsies, 11 of 1,240 (0.9%) rufinamide-treated patients had episodes that could be described as status epilepticus compared with none of 635 patients in the placebo-treated patients.

### Unusual acral bullous dyshidrosiform rash associated with acute human herpes virus-6 infection in a 2-year-old girl [^7c42e4e0]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 2-year-old girl presented to our dermatology clinic with a bullous rash on her hands (Fig 1) and feet (Fig 2). The rash was characterized by tense vesiculobullous lesions without an erythematous base, which is consistent with a dyshidrosiform pattern.The patient's mother reported that the rash had appeared approximately 1 week after the child had experienced a high fever lasting 5 days and irritability.

Fig 1 
Vesicles and small bullae with dyshidrosiform appearance on the hands.

Fig 2 
Tense bullae on the plantar region.

The patient had no significant past medical history and was previously healthy. There was no family history of immunodeficiency or dermatological conditions.

Blood tests were performed to further investigate the cause of the rash. Routine laboratory tests and inflammatory markers showed no significant abnormalities. Additionally, anti-desmoglein (anti-Dsg1 and anti-Dsg3) antibodies, anti-bullous pemphigoid (anti-BP180 and anti-BP230) antibodies, and anti-collagen VII antibodies were negative. Anti-tissue transglutaminase 3 autoantibodies were also negative. Microbiological investigations included testing for IgG and IgM antibodies to Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, parvovirus B19, and coxsackievirus. Notably, the patient had cytomegalovirus IgG at 118 U/mL (positive if >14 U/mL) and Parvovirus B19 IgG at 42.20 U/mL (positive if >2.5 U/mL) but had negative IgM. Calibrated quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to evaluate the presence and copy number of HHV-6 and HHV-7 revealed the presence of more than 40,000 copies/mL of HHV-6 DNA, indicating an active infection.

The child was treated with betamethasone 0.1% cream applied twice daily and emollients for 10 days until the skin symptoms resolved. Four weeks later, HHV-6 DNA levels were undetectable, confirming resolution of the infection.

Introduction

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is causing a rapidly expanding pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website describes fever, cough, and shortness of breath as the primary symptoms of the disease, but it does not describe cutaneous manifestations of the illness. Understanding how COVID-19 might present on the skin may help practitioners and patients recognize and manage the disease more effectively.

### Unusual presentation of rheumatic fever in a 3-year-old child in the UK [^dc6917cc]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

In the developed world, acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is rare. When it does arise, symptoms commonly include fever, arthralgia and rash. We describe a presentation of a 3-year-old child with ARF in a UK District General Hospital. The patient had a 6-week history of diarrhoea, rash and intermittent right hip arthralgia. This was initially thought to be a viral illness until she re-presented with shortness of breath and fever with a pan-systolic murmur. A throat-culture was negative, but an anti-streptolysin titre was elevated, with a bedside echocardiogram demonstrating moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. The young child was transferred to the local tertiary centre for further management; however, she went on to develop acute left ventricular failure. This case illustrates the need to be vigilant for the presentation of a rare illness, such as rheumatic fever, as there can be significant impacts on the quality of life of young patients.

Differential diagnosis of fever and rash—tickborne rickettsial diseases: The differential is broad, and early in illness these diseases can be clinically indistinguishable from many viral exanthems and other illnesses, particularly in children, and can be mistaken for conditions including viral gastroenteritis, upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, nonrickettsial bacterial sepsis, TTP, idiopathic vasculitides, or viral or bacterial meningoencephalitides. Despite nonspecific initial symptoms, early consideration in the differential diagnosis and empiric treatment is critical in preventing poor outcomes, especially for RMSF, which progresses rapidly without treatment.

### Azithromycin (Zmax) [^3fd29a56]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Pediatric Patients:

The data described below reflect exposure to Zmax in 907 pediatric patients. The population was 3 months to 12 years of age. All patients received a single 60 mg/kg oral dose of Zmax.

As in adults, the most common treatment-related adverse reactions in pediatric subjects were gastrointestinal in nature. The pediatric subjects all received a single 60 mg/kg dose (equivalent to 27 mg/lb) of Zmax.

In a study with 450 pediatric subjects (ages 3 months to 48 months), vomiting (11%), diarrhea (10%) loose stools (9%), and abdominal pain (2%) were the most frequently reported treatment-related gastrointestinal adverse reactions. Many treatment related gastrointestinal adverse reactions with an incidence greater than 1% began on the day of dosing in these subjects [43% (68/160)] and most [53% (84/160)] resolved within 48 hours of onset. Treatment-related adverse events that were not gastrointestinal, occurring with a frequency ≥ 1% were: rash (5%), anorexia (2%), fever (2%), and dermatitis (2%).

In a second study of 337 pediatric subjects, ages 2 years to 12 years, the most frequently reported treatment-related adverse reactions also included vomiting (14%), diarrhea (7%), loose stools (2%), nausea (4%) and abdominal pain (4%).

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^59808268]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Graves’ disease (GD)—management when antithyroid drugs are used: Methimazole should be used in virtually every child who is treated with antithyroid drug therapy. Pediatric patients and their caretakers should be informed of side effects of antithyroid drugs and the necessity of stopping the medication immediately and informing their physician if they develop pruritic rash, jaundice, acolic stools or dark urine, arthralgias, abdominal pain, nausea, fatigue, fever, or pharyngitis. Prior to initiating antithyroid drug therapy, we suggest that pediatric patients have, as a baseline, complete blood cell count, including white blood cell count with differential, and a liver profile including bilirubin, transaminases, and alkaline phosphatase. Beta adrenergic blockade is recommended for children experiencing symptoms of hyperthyroidism, especially those with heart rates in excess of 100 beats per minute. Antithyroid medication should be stopped immediately, and white blood counts measured in children who develop fever, arthralgias, mouth sores, pharyngitis, or malaise. When propylthiouracil is used in children, the medication should be stopped immediately and liver function and hepatocellular integrity assessed in children who experience anorexia, pruritis, rash, jaundice, light-colored stool or dark urine, joint pain, right upper quadrant pain or abdominal bloating, nausea or malaise. Persistent minor cutaneous reactions to methimazole therapy in children should be managed by concurrent antihistamine treatment or cessation of the medication and changing to therapy with radioactive iodine or surgery, and in the case of a serious allergic reaction to an antithyroid medication, prescribing the other antithyroid drug is not recommended.

Human herpesvirus 6B end-organ disease and other outcomes post-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation

Human herpesvirus 6B primary infection versus reactivation

Only two cases of primary HHV-6B infection after allogeneic HSCT have been reported; these were in very young children and were accompanied by fever and rash. In contrast, various end-organ diseases and other complications post-HSCT have been associated with HHV-6B reactivation. But apart from encephalitis and fever with rash, the evidence for causation is moderate or weak (Table 4).

Table 4. 
Human herpesvirus 6B reactivation after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: disease associations.

Human herpesvirus 6B encephalitis and its definition

The first described encephalitis casewas followed by many confirmatory reports.Zerr and Ogata analyzed the accumulated published data and provided evidence for a causal association between HHV-6 and encephalitis using the Bradford Hill criteria.

The most frequent cause of encephalitis after allogeneic transplant is HHV-6. When the species is identified, it is almost invariably HHV-6B. Of the only three reported patients with HHV-6A encephalitis, one had an atypical presentation and the other two had unrecognized CIHHV-6.In one of these two, testing of archived samples confirmed CIHHV-6A pre-HSCT,but the question remained as to whether reactivation of the virus causing encephalitis or an alternative unidentified cause was responsible. Whether CIHHV-6B can reactivate causing encephalitis is theoretically possible, but requires viral culture and sequencing to distinguish childhood-acquired HHV-6B from integrated virus.

Human herpesvirus 6B encephalitis typically presents early as post-transplant acute limbic encephalitis (PALE). CSF protein and cell counts are often unremarkable (see Table 5 for further clinical features). Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be negative at the start of the disease, changes in the temporal lobe are demonstrated in approximately 60% of cases.However, similar observations occur in limbic encephalitis caused by other infectious agents.Extrahippocampal abnormalities may occur in areas such as the entorhinal cortex or amygdala.Temporal lobe seizures are relatively frequent but focal neurological deficits are rare. Computed tomography of the brain is often normal. Electroencephalograms are usually diffusely abnormal sometimes involving the temporal region. Autopsy reveals hippocampal disease with HHV-6 protein in astrocytes and neurons suggesting local virus reactivationrather than an indirect effect of virally-induced neuroinflammation. Notably, a retrospective studyshowed that only one-third of HHV-6 encephalitis patients had the typical features of PALE.

### Urticaria mimickers in children [^6a5939f7]. Dermatologic Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Acute urticaria is a self-limited cutaneous condition marked by transient, erythematous, and pruritic wheals. It is a hypersensitivity response that is often secondary to infection, medications, or food allergies in children. In contrast, the urticarial "mimickers" described in this review article are often seen in the context of fever and extracutaneous manifestations in pediatric patients. The differential diagnosis ranges from benign and self-limited hypersensitivity responses to multisystem inflammatory diseases. Establishing the correct diagnosis of an urticarial rash in a pediatric patient is necessary to both prevent an unnecessary work up for self-limited conditions and to appropriately recognize and evaluate multisystem inflammatory disorders. Herein, we describe two cases to illustrate the clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, histopathology and differential diagnoses for several mimickers of acute urticaria including: urticaria multiforme, serum sickness like reaction, Henoch-Schönlein purpura, acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy, systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis, cryopyrin associated periodic syndromes, and urticarial vasculitis.

### Reactivation of BCG inoculation site in a child with febrile exanthema of 3 days duration: an early indicator of incomplete Kawasaki disease [^be1e1100]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

The aetiology of febrile exanthems in children is often difficult to distinguish clinically. A diagnosis of Kawasaki disease (KD) should be considered in infants with exanthematous fever. More perplexing is the increasing incidence of an atypical form of KD. Pathogenesis of KD remains unclear even though an aberrant response of the immune system to an unidentified pathogen is often hypothesised. A 30-fold increase in the incidence of KD in Italy during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic suggests an immune response to a viral trigger. We report an infant clinically diagnosed with high probability as incomplete KD, who presented with reactivation of the BCG injection site even though fever with rash was only less than 3 days duration. Echocardiography confirmed coronary artery abnormalities and prompt treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin facilitated rapid recovery. Physicians should consider a diagnosis of KD if BCG site reactivation is noted in children presenting with febrile exanthema.

### Murine typhus in 5 children hospitalized for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children [^458316b6]. Hospital Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is an emerging disease described in children in association with infection or epidemiological link to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Signs and symptoms include fever, rash, and cardiac dysfunction; US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have put forth broad criteria for diagnosis. The illness is serious and can progress rapidly to heart failure and death. However, findings in MIS-C are nonspecific, and there is significant overlap with other systemic illnesses, including Kawasaki disease and several viral and bacterial infections. We present 5 children admitted to a teaching hospital within an 11-day period in May 2020 for MIS-C evaluation who were later diagnosed with murine typhus. Typhus is a rickettsial infection that presents with fever and rash, and, although usually self-limited, responds well to treatment with doxycycline to shorten the course of illness. Clinical and laboratory characteristics of these children are presented to illustrate similarities to MIS-C, which can also be shared with viral, bacterial, or other regional endemic infections, as well as noninfectious inflammatory diseases. This case series serves to remind pediatric hospitalists to be vigilant to avoid premature closure on MIS-C for children admitted with fever and systemic inflammation. Maintaining a wide differential diagnosis in approaching such patients is of utmost importance as community exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is likely and evidence of past infection becomes commonplace.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 10 post-travel evaluation [^634ee0e0]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Post-travel fever evaluation—clinical reassessment and skin findings can guide diagnosis. If the initial examination is unrevealing, the text advises to repeat the exam at least daily if the diagnosis is not clear because new findings might appear that will help in the diagnostic process, and notes that although most febrile illnesses are infectious, other conditions including pulmonary emboli and drug hypersensitivity reactions also can be associated with fever. Fever as part of a clinical syndrome deserves further scrutiny because it could indicate a disease of public health concern; yet undifferentiated presentations are common in malaria, typhoid fever, or dengue, and this distinction provides only a rough guide because malaria may present with focal symptoms, so misdiagnosing a patient with gastroenteritis who actually has malaria could negatively impact outcome. Dermatologic presentations are frequent in returned travelers; skin rashes can evolve rapidly and lesion types and locations can aid diagnosis of systemic infections (e.g., arboviral infections, measles, spotted fever group rickettsioses, typhoid fever, acute schistosomiasis, or acute HIV infection), and petechial or purpuric lesions may indicate meningococcal disease.

### Bartonella quintana transmission from mite to family with high socioeconomic status [^89a03b74]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Urban trench fever caused by Bartonella quintana has been reported in persons who abuse alcohol and in homeless persons in large cities worldwide. Symptoms vary from asymptomatic intermittent bacteremia to serious complications. Pediculus humanus lice, the known vector of the infection, are not always identified, which raises the possibility that other vectors might also be involved. We report on an outbreak of B. quintana infection among a young family of high socioeconomic status and their visiting relatives.

The family resides in a regional city (population 104,000) in northern Czech Republic in an old, renovated apartment located on the top floor, just under the roof. In the summer of 2007, hundreds of ectoparasitic mites migrated from a hole in the roof and settled on the inner side of a permanently open window before infesting family members. Two weeks later (day 1 of symptom onset), a papular rash and pruritic vesicular lesions were noted by the parents on the body and legs of their 2 children, a 1-year-old girl and a 3-year-old boy. On day 3, the girl’s body temperature rose to 38.0°C, and the boy’s temperature rose to 39.5°C. The rash resolved in ≈10 days in both children. Vesicular lesions on the girl’s buccal mucosal membrane resolved in 5 days. Excoriated areas resulting from spontaneous rupture of lesions or scratching were still visible on day 14.

On day 4, a fever (temperature, 38.5°C) and intense tibialgia, which persisted for 5 days, developed in the 33-year-old father of the infected children. On day 5, a vesicular rash, which resolved in 10 days, developed in the 33-year-old mother. The children’s grandfather and both grandmothers also showed symptoms of infection within ≈14 days after having spent > 1 days or nights in the infected family’s household (Table). In addition, the regional epidemiologist who was involved in the investigation showed development of a severe infection 16 days after exposure to implicated mites that escaped from a collection tube (Table). Recurrent fevers of decreasing intensity, followed by remissions at 1-week intervals, were observed in all patients for up to 3 months.

### Polyarthritis in a child with rosai-dorfman disease [^c1d1bf9d]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

A 5-year-old boy presented with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy and polyarthritis. Systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis was initially considered in the differential diagnosis, but lymph node biopsy established the diagnosis of Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD). The arthritis recurred twice. Both times it correlated with the severity of the other clinical and laboratory abnormalities of RDD and responded to treatment with dexamethasone and vinblastine. This report adds inflammatory arthritis to the extranodal manifestations of RDD in children and suggests that this disorder should be considered as a rare cause of fever with rash, lymphadenopathy and arthritis.

The Morning Report section continues this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and clinical course, inviting readers to develop a differential diagnosis and uncover the final diagnosis alongside the authors. This report details the story of a previously healthy 7-year-old boy who presented with 10 days of fever after travel to Bangladesh. Through targeted history, physical examination, and diagnostic testing, an illness script is developed. As the case progresses, the differential diagnosis is refined until a final diagnosis is established.

Case Presentation

A 25-year-old man with cerebral palsy, scoliosis, and ventilator dependence since SARS-CoV-2 infection 11 months earlier presented with a 2-week history of chest redness and swelling. The area of erythema and edema was located on the left side of the anterior chest and had grown to approximately 9 cm in diameter over the 2 weeks. It was tender to palpation. There was no history of trauma, injury, or bug bites at that site. He had not had a rash or similar lesions elsewhere on his body and had not taken any new medications. He did have increased, thick, yellow secretions from his tracheostomy, but no fevers. He was born in the Dominican Republic and moved to the United States as a child. He had not traveled anywhere outside the United States in more than a decade.

### NLRP12-associated systemic autoinflammatory diseases in children [^a3f15efa]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Canakinumab is a long-acting humanized anti-monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to IL-1β and blocks it from binding to the IL-1 receptor. The FDA approved it for the treatment of periodic fever syndrome (including FMF, CAPS, HIDS/mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD), and TRAPS) in adults and children over 2 years old. The European Union (EU) also approved canakinumab for the treatment of Still’s disease and gouty arthritis. The half-life is approximately 21–28 days, and the drug can be injected once every 8 weeks. The initial doses of canakinumab are 4 mg/kg for 2-to-4-year-old children with body weight ≥ 7.5 kg and for children older than 4 years with body weight between 7.5 and 15 kg and 2 mg/kg for those weighing 15–40 kg; 150 mg can be administered directly to children weighing over 40 kg. The maintenance dose depends on the clinical response of each patient. Kostik et al. reported a case of a female NLRP12-AID patient with a severe clinical course (monthly periodic fever, splenomegaly, arthralgia, abdominal pain, episodic urticarial-like rash, growth delay, and high CRP) who was treated with canakinumab due to failed corticosteroids treatment. The initial dose of canakinumab was 2 mg/kg every 8 weeks which was gradually increased to 5 mg/kg every 4 weeks. This treatment led to resolution of her rash, abdominal pain, and arthralgia, and fever episodes became rare and very mild. Basaran et al. reported a case of a male child with NLRP12-AID with C3 glomerulopathy who relapsed after symptom relief with glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide. His skin rash disappeared within 24 h after anakinra (1 mg/kg/d) was first administered, and other symptoms were also ameliorated. CRP/ESR decreased to normal levels within 15 days, and bilateral papilledema resolved after 1 month. Because the frequent injections caused local pain and injection reactions, the treatment plan was adjusted to canakinumab 2 mg/kg once per month, and no relapse was observed at the 1-year follow-up.

MIS-C or missed diagnosis?

M. Wiggelinkhuizen, G. J. Jaspers

Pediatric Intensive Care, RadboudUMC, Nijmegen, Netherlands

Critical Care 2021, 25 (Suppl 1): P083

Introduction : The objective of this case description is to create awareness among pediatric intensivists about the diagnostic pitfalls regarding Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) and its differential diagnosis.

Methods : By means of two case descriptions, we illustrate and reflect on the pitfalls that led to both under- and overdiagnosis of MIS-C.

Results : Brief patient descriptions are presented in Table 1. The 3-year-old patient was misdiagnosed for MIS-C and turned out to have a perforated appendicitis with peritonitis. The suspicion of MIS-C was based on clinical symptoms in combination with the elevated NT-pro-BNP, which is often seen in MIS-C. However, elevated cardiac biomarkers as NT-pro-BNP and Troponin-T may also be caused by non-cardiac causes, like sepsis, shock and ARDS [1]. The combination of fever, gastrointestinal symptoms and hypotension that were present in this girl, are often presenting symptoms of patients with MIS-C. However, they are not specific and are seen in a range of other diagnoses as well. The 8-year-old girl, with the same symptoms of fever, gastrointestinal symptoms and hypotension, was initially diagnosed for acute appendicitis, but turned out to have MIS-C with left ventricular failure. While no clear symptom or biomarker can distinguish between MIS-C and its differential diagnosis, the presence of conjunctivitis, skin rash and/or coronary dilatation on echocardiography are suggestive for MIS-C, while blood cultures can help to differentiate MIS-C from septic shock / toxic shock syndrome.

Conclusions : Intensivists have to be aware of the existence of MIS-C and the pitfalls of its broad clinical and biochemical abnormalities. Accurate physical examination, including examination for conjunctivitis and rash, echocardiography and blood culture results can be supportive to make the correct diagnosis and to start the right treatment, right on time!

Consent to publish was obtained from parents of both patients.

### Murine typhus as a cause of cognitive impairment: case report and a review of the literature [^60162aea]. Pediatric Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Murine typhus is a systemic febrile illness caused by Rickettsia typhi, a gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterium. It is found worldwide, including in the United States, where cases are concentrated in suburban areas of Texas and California. The disease manifests with fever, headache, and rash. Central nervous system involvement is rare in both adults and children. Aseptic meningitis and meningoencephalitis are the most common neurological presentations, occurring in 2% to 5% of cases. Neurological dysfunction, including memory impairment and behavioral alterations, can occur and usually are reversible. Long-term deficits are considered rare even in untreated cases and have not been described in the pediatric population.

Methods

Single case report.

Results

We describe a previously healthy 17-year-old girl infected with R. typhi who developed meningoencephalitis that resulted in chronic cognitive impairment despite treatment.

Conclusion

Murine typhus should be considered in the differential diagnosis of aseptic meningitis and meningoencephalitis. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent death and long-term morbidity.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 4 travel-associated infections and diseases [^86e0a578]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Chikungunya—clinical features and course in travelers are described as follows: The incubation period is typically 3–7 days (range 1–12 days), with sudden onset of high fever (temperature typically 39° C [102° F]) and joint pains; fevers typically last for 1 week and can be biphasic. Joint symptoms are typically severe, debilitating, and usually bilateral and symmetric, most commonly affecting hands and feet but possibly more proximal joints. Other findings include conjunctivitis, headache, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, and a morbilliform rash that often pruritic and involves trunk and extremities and can include palms, soles, and face. Abnormal laboratory findings can include elevated creatinine and liver function tests, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia; rare but serious complications include hepatitis, myocarditis, neurologic disease, ocular disease, acute renal disease, and severe bullous skin lesions. Acute symptoms typically resolve in 7–10 days, but some patients have continuation or relapse of rheumatologic symptoms for months after acute illness, and studies report variable proportions, ranging from 5% to 80%, with persistent joint pains and prolonged fatigue for months or years. Deaths occur but are rare and are reported most commonly in older adults with comorbidities and young infants infected perinatally or by mosquito bites. In pregnancy, symptoms and outcomes are similar to others and most infections during pregnancy will not result in transmission to the fetus; however, intrapartum transmission can result in neonatal complications including hemorrhagic symptoms, myocardial disease, and neurologic disease, and rare spontaneous abortions after first-trimester maternal infection have been reported.

### Case report of drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms demonstrating human herpesvirus-6 reactivation [^62f3d5fa]. Pediatric Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is a severe drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome that presents with diffuse cutaneous eruptions, fever, and multiorgan involvement. Here we present a pediatric case of DRESS complicated by human herpesvirus (HHV)-6 reactivation. After 1 week of sulfasalazine, our patient developed a diffuse morbilliform eruption. Sulfasalazine was discontinued. The patient presented to the emergency department soon thereafter with worsening eruption, fever, rigors, facial edema, and lymphadenopathy. Methylprednisolone was initiated. Peripheral smear did not demonstrate eosinophilia but showed toxic granulation with atypical lymphocytes. Transaminase levels and white blood cell count quickly became elevated, with increased eosinophils, suggesting DRESS. During the methylprednisolone taper, our patient experienced symptom exacerbation, acute hepatitis, and HHV-6 seroconversion, indicating HHV-6 reactivation as the cause. As demonstrated by our patient, a decelerated methylprednisone taper is important because of potential symptom flaring during taper. Additionally, in the care of individuals with DRESS, HHV-6 is often tested for upon admission and not repeated. Delay in the rise of titers necessitates repeat testing.
