## Question

Whats the bun level to cause uremia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there is a specific blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level that defines uremia and when dialysis should be initiated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "uremia" clinically means beyond just an elevated BUN. Then, I should verify how reliable BUN is as a marker of uremic toxicity. Next, I will examine what major guidelines say about numeric thresholds, if any, for starting dialysis. After that, I should review the literature for practical BUN ranges that clinicians often cite and how they relate to symptoms. Finally, I will synthesize a clinically actionable, safety-oriented approach that treats the patient, not the number.

> Let me first confirm the definition of uremia, because I need to ensure I'm not equating uremia with a single BUN value. Uremia is the clinical syndrome of kidney failure characterized by accumulation of multiple nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous waste products, with manifestations that include encephalopathy, pericarditis, pleuritis, bleeding diathesis, nausea/vomiting, pruritus, and other systemic disturbances; BUN itself is a surrogate and relatively nontoxic compared with other retained solutes, so "uremia" is not defined by BUN alone [^1121gcVt] [^117KWaP8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about BUN being the culprit; I should double-check its limitations. BUN reflects the nitrogen component of urea, and its concentration is heavily influenced by extrarenal factors such as protein intake, gastrointestinal bleeding, catabolic states, corticosteroids, and volume status, and in critical illness it behaves poorly as a marker of true uremic toxin burden, so an isolated high BUN is not "uremia" and should not trigger dialysis by itself [^1178DFgo] [^111HYDNV] [^111xVpK1].

> Next, I should review guidelines to see if any endorse a BUN threshold. Wait, let me verify the key documents: KDIGO advises initiating RRT emergently for life-threatening fluid, electrolyte, or acid-base disturbances, and otherwise to consider the broader clinical context and trends rather than BUN or creatinine thresholds alone. KDOQI similarly emphasizes not basing the decision to start dialysis on a single BUN or eGFR value, focusing instead on symptoms and patient-centered factors [^112ZkkL9] [^114UeM3b] [^112cqute].

> I will now examine what the ICU literature actually says about numeric ranges, but I need to be careful not to overinterpret observational cutoffs. Multiple critical care reviews note that many studies historically used a serum urea threshold around 35–40 mmol/L (about 100–114 mg/dL) as an upper limit to initiate RRT, yet this was often in the absence of high-quality evidence linking a specific urea level to improved outcomes; moreover, a BUN less than about 40 mmol/L is generally not considered an indication for RRT in isolation, especially without other signs of AKI or organ dysfunction [^1177Q1zb] [^113uisNb] [^1178DFgo].

> But wait, what if we are concerned about symptomatic uremia? Is there a symptom-linked range clinicians use? Some ICU narratives suggest that with established kidney injury, overt uremic symptoms such as encephalopathy or pericarditis are more likely when blood urea exceeds roughly 50 mmol/L (about 140 mg/dL), yet they caution that correlation with symptoms is poor and multifactorial, reinforcing that decisions should be clinical rather than number-based; similarly, in pregnancy on dialysis, targeting maternal BUN below about 48–49 mg/dL has been associated with better fetal outcomes, underscoring that BUN can be a crude proxy for uremic burden in special contexts, not a universal threshold [^112ge7Vh] [^115chob9] [^113yGdZv].

> Let me consider the pathophysiology to ensure I'm not missing a mechanistic rationale for a BUN cut-point. Urea itself is now recognized to exert direct and indirect toxicity, including oxidative stress and protein carbamylation, which can damage vascular endothelium, pancreatic beta cells, and other tissues; however, these effects are concentration- and context-dependent and do not translate into a single BUN threshold that defines clinically significant uremia across populations [^112BCidJ] [^111Tv6kn] [^112ZkkL9].

> I should confirm the practical clinical triggers that supersede BUN. Life-threatening indications for emergent RRT include severe hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis with pH less than about 7.2, pulmonary edema from volume overload refractory to diuretics, and certain drug toxicities; outside these, persistent oliguria/anuria, rising creatinine with clinical deterioration, and progressive uremic symptoms (encephalopathy, pericarditis, bleeding) guide timing, whereas isolated BUN elevation without corroborating clinical or laboratory context should prompt reassessment of nonrenal drivers rather than immediate dialysis [^112ZkkL9] [^116upmMU] [^111xVpK1].

> Putting this together, I should double-check my bottom line. There is no universally accepted BUN level that defines uremia or mandates dialysis initiation; uremia is a clinical syndrome diagnosed by symptoms and organ involvement in the setting of kidney failure, and decisions to start dialysis should be individualized and guideline-concordant, using BUN only as supportive context rather than a standalone trigger [^112ZkkL9] [^114xTKBY].

> Practical guidance I can stand behind: in stable patients without emergent indications, a BUN persistently above roughly 100–114 mg/dL (about 35–40 mmol/L) warrants heightened vigilance for uremic symptoms and organ dysfunction, but it is not by itself an indication for dialysis. In contrast, when BUN approaches or exceeds about 140 mg/dL (about 50 mmol/L) in the context of established AKI or CKD, the likelihood of uremic complications increases and dialysis should be strongly considered if accompanied by symptoms or biochemical indications, while remembering that earlier initiation based on BUN alone has not consistently improved outcomes in trials [^1177Q1zb] [^112ge7Vh] [^112ZkkL9].

> Finally, I need to ensure I emphasize the principle: treat the patient, not the number. BUN is a useful marker of nitrogenous waste accumulation and carries prognostic information, but it is neither specific nor sufficient to define uremia; dialysis initiation should be driven by the clinical syndrome, patient trajectory, and guideline-based emergencies, with BUN serving as an adjunct to, not a substitute for, clinical judgment [^112ZkkL9] [^114xTKBY] [^111xVpK1].

---

There is **no single BUN threshold** that defines uremia; uremia is a clinical syndrome diagnosed by symptoms and organ dysfunction, not by BUN alone [^112ZkkL9]. BUN > 100 mg/dL (35.7 mmol/L) is commonly used to prompt evaluation for dialysis, but **symptoms and organ dysfunction** — not BUN alone — should guide initiation [^1177Q1zb]. BUN is influenced by non-renal factors (diet, GI bleeding, catabolism), so decisions must be individualized and context-specific [^111xVpK1].

---

## Clinical definition of uremia

Uremia is the **clinical syndrome** of advanced kidney failure with systemic accumulation of uremic toxins, causing multi-organ dysfunction [^1121gcVt]. Diagnosis is clinical, integrating symptoms, organ dysfunction, and laboratory abnormalities — not any single BUN value [^112ZkkL9].

---

## BUN levels associated with uremic symptoms

Although no single BUN threshold defines uremia, **higher BUN correlates with increased risk** of uremic symptoms and complications:

- **BUN > 100 mg/dL (35.7 mmol/L)**: commonly used as a threshold to evaluate for dialysis initiation, but not an absolute indication [^1177Q1zb].
- **BUN > 80 mg/dL (28.6 mmol/L)**: often associated with uremic symptoms (encephalopathy, pericarditis, bleeding) in acute kidney injury (AKI) [^116upmMU].
- **BUN > 50 mg/dL (17.9 mmol/L)**: may be associated with uremic symptoms in chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially with other risk factors [^112LG4Ug].

These thresholds are **guidelines**; clinical judgment and patient-specific factors are essential [^112ZkkL9].

---

## Limitations of BUN as a marker of uremia

BUN is a **surrogate marker** with several limitations:

- **Non-renal factors**: Dietary protein intake, gastrointestinal bleeding, catabolic states, and dehydration can elevate BUN independently of kidney function [^111HYDNV].
- **Poor correlation**: BUN correlates poorly with specific uremic symptoms and organ dysfunction [^116KzYZ8].
- **Individual variability**: Patients may develop uremic symptoms at different BUN levels, depending on comorbidities and clinical context [^112ge7Vh].

---

## Clinical guidelines for dialysis initiation

Current guidelines emphasize **individualized decisions** based on clinical context rather than BUN alone:

- **KDIGO guidelines**: Recommend initiating dialysis based on clinical indications (e.g. metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, volume overload, uremic symptoms) rather than specific BUN thresholds [^112ZkkL9].
- **KDOQI guidelines**: Emphasize assessing uremic symptoms, patient preferences, and clinical context rather than relying solely on BUN or creatinine levels [^114UeM3b].

---

## Clinical implications of elevated BUN levels

Elevated BUN levels are associated with **increased risk** of adverse outcomes, including:

- **Mortality**: Higher BUN levels are independently associated with increased mortality in CKD and acute coronary syndromes [^117JJKFv] [^117DdDX4].
- **Cardiovascular complications**: Elevated BUN is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events and progression of CKD [^114N3R46] [^115GufkV].
- **Uremic symptoms**: Higher BUN levels correlate with increased risk of uremic symptoms, although no specific threshold defines symptom onset [^112LG4Ug] [^112ge7Vh].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Bun level (mg/dl)** | **Clinical implications** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| > 100 | Commonly used threshold for dialysis evaluation | Not absolute indication [^1177Q1zb] |
| > 80 | Associated with uremic symptoms in AKI | Clinical judgment required [^112ZkkL9] |
| > 50 | May be associated with uremic symptoms in CKD | Depends on clinical context [^112ge7Vh] |

---

## Conclusion

There is **no single BUN threshold** that defines uremia; uremia is a clinical syndrome diagnosed by symptoms and organ dysfunction, not BUN alone [^1167SQgG]. BUN > 100 mg/dL is commonly used to prompt dialysis evaluation, but decisions should be individualized based on clinical context, symptoms, and patient-specific factors [^114iMsNR].

### Uremic toxicity: urea and beyond [^116KzYZ8]. Seminars in Dialysis (2001). Low credibility.

Successful replacement of renal function with dialysis supports the concept that uremia is a toxic state resulting from accumulated solutes and that toxicity results from high concentrations of these solutes in body fluids. Dialyzer clearance of urea, a surrogate toxin, is the currently accepted best measure of dialysis and dialysis adequacy, but it is admittedly a compromise due to current lack of knowledge about and inability to measure more toxic solutes. This failure could be explained if uremic toxicity is actually a summation effect of multiple toxins, each at individual subtoxic levels in the patient. Other solutes could be used as surrogates to measure clearance, but urea happens to be available in high concentrations, is easily measured by all clinical laboratories, and is easily dialyzed, so changes in concentration are sensitive indicators of clearance. Measurements of creatinine clearance are confounded by the disequilibrium that occurs across red cells within the dialyzer and in the patient. Other solutes probably behave more like creatinine than urea, so urea stands out as uniquely diffusible, a property that actually spoils its effectiveness as a surrogate toxin, especially when applied to more frequent and continuous dialysis. Accumulation of other solutes may correlate better with toxic uremic symptoms and the residual syndrome. More studies are needed to examine the kinetics of other solutes, their generation rates, and their distribution volumes to provide clinicians with more knowledge and tools to optimize dialysis treatments. Examination of the effectiveness of solute removal in patients dialyzed more frequently may provide significant insight into the pathogenesis of uremia.

### Searching for uremic toxins [^115svpvt]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Treatment of uremia by hemodialysis has become widespread over the last 40 years and has improved substantially over that time. However, people treated with this modality continue to suffer from multiple disabilities. Retention of organic solutes, especially those poorly removed by hemodialysis, likely contributes to these disabilities. Certain classes of solutes are removed less well than urea by hemodialysis and by the normal kidney. These include protein-bound solutes, relatively large solutes, sequestered compounds, and substances removed at rates higher than urea by the normal kidney. Several strategies could be used to discover the solutes responsible for residual morbidities in standardly dialyzed people. Rather than continue to focus only on urea removal as an index for dialysis adequacy, finding additional approaches for removing toxic solutes with characteristics different from urea (and the similar small solutes it represents) is a desirable and feasible goal.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^117F5Z97]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Hemodialysis adequacy — postdialysis urea rebound and sampling implications — If the blood sample is drawn immediately upon completion of dialysis, just-dialyzed blood that has recirculated into the access will dilute the sample, leading to a falsely decreased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) value and artificially elevated Kt/V and URR, and thus overestimation of delivered dialysis. Early urea rebound (≤ 3 minutes after dialysis) may be viewed as a 2-component process in which rebound from recirculation begins immediately upon completion of hemodialysis (HD) and resolves in less than 1 minute, usually within 20 seconds, while the CAPR component begins approximately 20 seconds after stopping HD and is completed 2 to 3 minutes after slowing or stopping the blood pump; the late phase (> 3 minutes) is completed within 30 to 60 minutes after cessation of dialysis.

### A history of uremia research [^115rJhS3]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

The history of uremia research begins with the discovery of urea and the subsequent association of elevated blood urea levels with the kidney disease described by Richard Bright, a well told story that needs no recounting. What this article highlights is how clinical and laboratory studies of urea launched the analysis of body fluids, first of urine and then of blood, that would beget organic chemistry, paved the way for the study of renal function and the use of urea clearance to determine "renal efficiency", provided for the initial classification of kidney disease, and clarified the concepts of diffusion and osmosis that would lead to the development of dialysis. Importantly and in contrast to how the synthesis of urea in the laboratory heralded the death of "vitalism", the clinical use of dialysis restored the "vitality" of comatose unresponsive dying uremic patients. The quest for uremic toxins that followed has made major contributions to what has been facetiously termed "molecular vitalism". In the course of these major achievements derived from the study of urea, the meaning of "what is life" has been gradually liberated from its past attribution to supernatural forces (vital spirit, archaeus, and vital force) thereby establishing the autonomy of biological life in which the kidney is the master chemist of the living body.

### Update of dialysis initiation timing in end stage kidney disease patients: is it a resolved question? A systematic literature review [^115Evmzi]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major global public health problem, and there is an increasing number of end stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients start dialysis annually. The decision on optimal initiation of maintenance dialysis is a common problem faced by nephrologists. During 1980s-2000s, extensive observational studies have been attempted to investigate the optimal estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at the start of dialysis. In 2010 a randomized controlled trial named "trial Initiating Dialysis Early and Late (IDEAL)" showed that a strategy of early dialysis initiation (target eGFR: 10–14 mL/min/1.73m2) was not superior to late initiation (waiting until symptoms develop or eGFR is 5–7 mL/min/1.73m2). Since then, clinical practice guidelines suggest that the decision of initiate maintenance dialysis should be guided primarily by clinical constellation of signs and symptoms attributable to uremic syndrome. However, symptoms or signs of uremia are varied and complex, mainly depends on clinical judgment; what's more, typical uremic symptoms such as pericarditis and encephalopathy in patients without volume overload often occur at a very low GFR, these conditions are often combined with severe metabolic disorders and/or organ damages; the exact optimal timing of dialysis for ESKD patients remains unknown.

Therefore, the aim of our study is to systematically review the available evidence with regard to the optimal initiation of maintenance dialysis in ESKD patients.

Due to the multifaceted aspects of kidney function, the management of CKD not only requires knowledge of kidney physiology and pathophysiology but also a keen understanding of how to diagnose, treat, and monitor the metabolic derangements and complications of reduced kidney function. In this article, we provide questions that cover a broad range of clinical scenarios that may test the clinical acumen of a kidney health professional. Each question starts with a brief clinical scenario to guide the reader. Questions are followed by a selection of answers. As in most clinical situations, a variety of tests and/or interventions may be appropriate. As knowledge on the management of kidney diseases and associated complications evolve, the optimal choice for these questions may also evolve.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^116XvJ8c]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Hemodialysis adequacy — limitations of Kt/V measurement and denominator choice: "To accurately measure Kt/V from the decrease in BUN levels during dialysis, the decrease must be significant, ie, the 2 concentrations (C0 and C) must be significantly different from one another (ratio > ~1.5)", implying the schedule "must be truly intermittent", and "As the frequency and duration increase, measurement of Kt/V becomes less precise". Measurement sessions can be biased because "modeled or measured dialysis may differ from the typical dialysis" and a study found "a higher average blood volume processed during the measured dialysis"; "In 20% of their patients, the difference was clinically significant", altering prescription elements. Regarding denominators, "The ideal denominator for dialysis dosage among patients of varying size is the generation rate of uremic toxins", and "the increase in Kt/V caused by weight loss (lower V)… likely is a false improvement". There are "No universally accepted adjustments", so nephrologists "should be aware of the pitfall and consider offering additional dialysis for patients with evidence of malnutrition". Using V avoids obesity-related errors but "does not eliminate the potential error in malnourished patients".

### Incidence of secondary pericardial effusions associated with different etiologies: a comprehensive review of literature [^115wRG8r]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Based on the absence of suggestive signs and symptoms for diagnosing PE in CKD patients, having laboratory data helps physicians as a guide for detecting more vulnerable patients to PE. It seems to be very practically useful. Unexpectedly, none of the kidney function (BUN, CR, GFR) indicators have demonstrated any significant correlation with the incidence of PE. Ravi et al. identified that heart rate > 100, potassium level > 5 mEq/L, and corrected calcium level < 8 mEq/dL were the predictors of the occurrence of PE, while only corrected calcium level < 8 was the only highly sensitive predictor of moderate to severe PE. Concerning the progression of hyperkalemia and hypocalcemia with deterioration of renal failure, increased incidence and volume of PE are expected. This would be a helpful information for screening of the patients with CKD. If they have any of these three factors, they will be a candidate for TTE, which is not feasible for all patients.

Interestingly, the presence or absence of PE does not significantly affect the survival rate or complications. If PE is not life-threatening or reducing the quality of life, treatment for these patients is still chosen based on kidney functions, not pericardial effusion. The mainstay of the treatment of PE due to uremia is initiating dialysis, and more than half of these patients respond to intensive hemodialysis. Moreover, if the response is unsatisfactory, other methods, such as pericardiocentesis, pericardial window, and pericardiectomy, should also be considered. As with different types of PE, whenever the PE is severe or the symptoms of tamponade are seen, treatment should be conducted as soon as possible and opted based on the available facilities, the patient's clinical condition, and the expertise of available physicians.

### Year in review 2013: critical care-nephrology [^114iMsNR]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Renal replacement therapy

In critically ill patients with AKI, urea and creatinine are not well performing indicators of renal function given the lack of steady state in terms of production and the influence of catabolism, volume status and production rates, particularly in sepsis. Consequently, physicians treating critically ill patients put an increasing emphasis on fluid overload, oliguria, impaired oxygenation and acidosis as triggers for initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) with a general trend to initiate RRT earlier in sicker patients. Thakar and colleagues performed an international survey predominantly among North American nephrologists consulting in the ICU. They evaluated practice patterns for the initiation of RRT using three different scenarios representing patients with increased severity of disease. The majority of the 172 respondents (70% USA) expressed a reticence in commencing RRT early given the lack of evidence, preferring to base their decision on absolute levels of creatinine or blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (> 442 μmol/l (> 5 mg/dl), > 35.6 mmol/l (> 100 mg/dl), respectively) rather than any relative rise. Despite this, 94% of physicians reported that they would be likely to start dialysis early in patients with the highest disease burden with early RRT described as a lower BUN on commencing treatment. Thus, the proportion of physicians starting dialysis at a BUN < 75 mg/dl tripled in the more severe case. Finally, given a selection of five parameters (BUN, creatinine, urine output, oxygenation and potassium) for starting RRT, the latter two were given the highest priority, with oxygen saturation appearing as the most frequent trigger in severe cases. These results also differ from a recently published survey among 275, mainly European, intensivists. Whereas the median thresholds with regard to sCr (300 μmol/l) or urea (40 mmol/l) were similar, there was a higher priority with hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis and volume overload. In addition, they demonstrated a trend towards early initiation of RRT, with the majority favoring initiation when a diagnosis of AKI was made based on AKIN/RIFLE criteria, particularly with regard to oliguria. As usual, it must be remarked that data from surveys have a high risk of self-selection of participants; however, these results should not be overlooked as they represent the view of a large panel of experts.

Hemodialysis adequacy — Guideline 2 methods for measuring and expressing the HD dose research: Tests of variance are needed for Kt/V measured in patients receiving daily dialysis treatments, because measured blood urea nitrogen (BUN) values will be considerably lower and excursions from predialysis BUN to postdialysis BUN also will be lower, reducing the power of kinetic modeling; this can be studied by drawing predialysis and postdialysis blood samples several days in succession, and if blood-based Kt/V is less reliable in these patients, better measures and additional comparative studies will be required if blood-based methods are inadequate.

### Challenges and pitfalls when implementing renal replacement therapy in the ICU [^111xVpK1]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

When is the ideal time to start RRT?

Several issues must be considered, including the timing of the intervention, the amount and frequency of dialysis, and the duration of therapy. In practice, these issues are based on individual physician preferences and experience; no set criteria are followed. A major factor is the heterogeneity in presentation of AKI that can occur de novo or can be superimposed on chronic kidney disease (CKD). A lack of specific symptoms other than oliguria further hampers recognition, particularly in ICU patients for whom symptoms that could be attributable to kidney injury may not be as evident and other organs compete for attention. Some observational studies and a few randomized trials have evaluated the timing of dialysis initiation and outcomes. In most of these studies, arbitrary cutoff values of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine were used to define the timing of initiation as early or late. In critically ill patients with AKI, these biomarkers are not reliable as measures to guide initiation of RRT. BUN levels are influenced by tubular reabsorption of urea, protein intake, catabolism, volume status, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and use of corticosteroids. Serum creatinine has a nonlinear correlation to kidney function. In AKI, unstable creatinine production, reduced muscle mass, aging, use of drugs interfering with tubular secretion, and variations within the creatinine assay make serum creatinine a nonreliable marker of the GFR. More recent studies have looked at AKI staging criteria and use of novel kidney damage biomarkers to initiate RRT but have had limited success.

### Blood urea nitrogen is independently associated with renal outcomes in Japanese patients with stage 3–5 chronic kidney disease: a prospective observational study [^114nfag1]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present study demonstrated that higher BUN levels were associated with adverse renal outcomes independent of eGFR in patients with moderate to severe CKD. A recent study reported that both BUN and cSosm were independent risk factors for CKD in patients with preserved kidney function. However, in the present study, a multivariable Cox analysis (Model 3) did not show a significant association between cSosm and poor renal outcomes. These findings suggest that the absolute BUN, rather than serum osmolality, could have predictive value for kidney disease progression. Conversely, in our cohort, higher BUN levels were significantly associated with poor outcomes in the higher but not the lower eGFR group, although there was no significant interaction for renal outcomes between BUN and eGFR levels as shown in Fig. 4. These results might suggest that the impact of the BUN level on kidney disease progression is stronger at earlier stages of CKD.

### Urea levels and cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic kidney disease [^117JJKFv]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The present prospective, epidemiological study is the first to our knowledge to show that serum urea levels are associated with CVD and mortality in non-dialysed patients with CKD, independently of renal function. Indeed, our analysis of a large cohort of patients with CKD demonstrated that individuals with elevated serum urea levels had a higher risk of CV outcomes and death.

### Correlation between parameters at initiation of renal replacement therapy and outcome in patients with acute kidney injury [^1161Nvoi]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Although the exact reasons for this observation are not clear, there are several plausible explanations. First, a low serum creatinine concentration may be a reflection of low muscle mass and therefore a surrogate marker of overall health status. Second, serum creatinine may also be low as a result of associated volume overload, a condition which has been found to be independently associated with mortality in ICU patients. Third, patients who start RRT with a lower serum creatinine may indeed start RRT for reasons other than azotaemia (ie. severe acidosis, fluid overload). It is possible that different indications for RRT are associated with different outcomes.

The role of serum urea as a trigger for RRT is also controversial, especially as urea is dependent on many non-renal factors. Liu and colleagues analysed the data of 243 patients on RRT and found a significantly higher risk of death at 60 days when serum urea level was 27.1 mmol/L or more (≥ 76 mg/dL) at time of RRT. Adjusted for age, hepatic failure, sepsis, thrombocytopenia and serum creatinine, the relative risk of death associated with initiation of RRT at a higher urea level was 1.85 (95% CI 1.16 to 2.96). In contrast, in our significantly larger patient population, we did not find any difference when using this cut-off. Instead, in a multivariate analysis, the most important independent prognostic factors among patients on RRT were mechanical ventilation, any associated organ failure, pre-existing chronic health problems, oligoanuria and a low serum pH at time of RRT.

### Measuring fluid balance in end-stage renal disease with a wearable bioimpedance sensor [^115eiar7]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Hematological changes showed a positive association with R E and a negative association with body weight. This is consistent with the intradialytic correlation between R E and hemoglobin and is most likely driven by hemoconcentration occurring during HD and hemodilution occurring as a result of fluid accumulation between HD sessions. Changes in systolic blood pressure also displayed a similar positive correlation with R E and negative correlation with body weight. For most patients with ESRD, the physician would expect the blood pressure to increase with increased fluid overload. Thus, changes in R E are found to reflect the expected pattern between fluid overload, blood pressure and hemoconcentration to the same extent as changes in weight.

As impaired kidney function compromises the clearance of waste products, including BUN and creatinine, elevated levels of these substances are routinely used as an indicator of renal dysfunction. The negative correlation observed with R E and both waste products could potentially be indirectly driven by fluid accumulation occurring alongside the accumulation of waste products in patients with severely impaired renal function. The fact that similar but positive correlations were observed with changes in weight could support this hypothesis. However, it is important to acknowledge that BUN and creatinine levels are not directly connected to fluid status and residual urine production. Moreover, both BUN and creatinine are confounded by several factors unrelated to kidney function. As the primary source of BUN is dietary protein, the concentration is dependent on the nutritional status of the patient. Thus, the strong correlation found between weight and BUN suggests the presence of fluctuations in body weight that are unrelated to changes in fluid balance. This is furthermore in agreement with the fact that R E correlated somewhat weaker with changes in body weight than expected based on the intradialytic correlation with UF volume.

Characteristics of biochemical indicators in the serum of patients with uremia

Uremia, also known as end-stage renal disease, is a state of severe kidney failure that leads to abnormalities in various biochemical markers in the blood, including urea, creatinine, electrolytes, and bone metabolism markers. As shown in Table 1, compared with those in Uremia-No dialysis group, the levels of total calcium, calcium-phosphorus products, AIF-1, iPTH, 25-OH-VD and FGF23 in the serum of patients who were on maintenance hemodialysis were significantly greater (P < 0.05), whereas the level of sKlotho was lower. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2-VitD3) is the main active form in humans, but due to its low blood concentration, short half-life, high biological variability, and susceptibility to interference from other compounds, its detection is complex and unstable. Current methods like high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC–MS) face technical challenges. In contrast, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) has a higher concentration, longer half-life, and greater stability, making it the primary indicator for assessing vitamin D status. Therefore, this study uses 25-hydroxyvitamin D, which is more easily tested clinically, instead of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. However, there were no changes in sex; age; or the levels of phosphate, albumin, bun, Cr, CHOL or TG. The data mentioned above suggest that the levels of total calcium, calcium-phosphorus products, AIF-1, iPTH, 25-OH-VD, FGF23 and sKlotho in the serum are associated with uremia.

### The fallacy of the BUN: creatinine ratio in critically ill patients [^1152Xg4Q]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in critically ill patients and is associated with a high mortality rate. Pre-renal azotemia, suggested by a high blood urea nitrogen to serum creatinine (BUN:Cr) ratio (BCR), has traditionally been associated with a better prognosis than other forms of AKI. Whether this pertains to critically ill patients is unknown.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective observational study of two cohorts of critically ill patients admitted to a single center: a derivation cohort, in which AKI was diagnosed, and a larger validation cohort. We analyzed associations between BCR and clinical outcomes: mortality and renal replacement therapy (RRT).

Results

Patients in the derivation cohort (N = 1010) with BCR > 20 were older, predominantly female and white, and more severely ill. A BCR > 20 was significantly associated with increased mortality and a lower likelihood of RRT in all patients, patients with AKI and patients at risk for AKI. Patients in the validation cohort (N = 10228) with a BCR > 20 were older, predominantly female and white, and more severely ill. A BCR > 20 was associated with increased mortality and a lower likelihood of RRT in all patients and in those at risk for AKI, BUN correlated with age and severity of illness.

Conclusions

A BCR > 20 is associated with increased mortality in critically ill patients. It is also associated with a lower likelihood of RRT, perhaps because of misinterpretation of the BCR. Clinicians should not use a BCR > 20 to classify AKI in critically ill patients.

Correlations of eGFR loci with blood urea nitrogen and CKD

We examined the correlation between eGFR-associated SNPs and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to determine whether the identified SNPs were directly related to kidney function rather than creatinine metabolism. Urea nitrogen is a harmful waste product that may accumulate in the blood if kidney function is impaired. Our BUN-related meta-analysis of GWASs involved BBJ and TWB datasets (n = 241,112). A total of 2365 replicated eGFR-associated SNPs were associated with BUN (P < 0.05; Supplementary Fig. 2a and Supplementary Data 5). The effect sizes of 2064 replicated eGFR-associated SNPs from 31 independent genomic risk loci associated with eGFR and BUN were strongly and inversely correlated (defined as kidney-relevant); this finding was consistent with the established understanding of kidney pathophysiology (Pearson's r = −0.86; P < 0.0001).

To determine whether the replicated eGFR-associated SNPs altered the risk of kidney diseases (e.g. CKD or ESKD), we conducted a logistic regression of a validation longitudinal cohort from the Clinical Research Data Repository of CMUH (CMUH-CRDR), which contains data regarding CKD follow-up status (CKD, n = 4509; control, n = 20,836). In addition, we examined the effect of replicated eGFR-associated SNPs on CKD; the results indicated that the effect direction of 397 replicated eGFR-associated SNPs on the eGFR was negatively correlated with the relevant effect direction of CKD (P < 0.05; maximum, median, and minimum odds ratios [ORs] = 1.02, 1.01, and 0.98, corresponding 95% confidence intervals [CIs] = 1.01–1.03, 1.00–1.01, 0.97–1.00, respectively; Pearson's r = −0.94, P < 0.0001; Supplementary Fig. 2b and Supplementary Data 6). These SNPs included 160 from 14 independent genomic risk loci likely related to kidney function, which were located close to the following genes: ASCC3, DCDC1, F12, FAM47E, FBXO22, HCRTR2, KNG1, LRP2, RAI14, NRG4, PAX8, PDILT, SIM1, STC1, TINAG, UBE2Q2, and WDR72.

Urea reduction ratio (URR) — definition, correlation, limitations, and impact of ultrafiltration are described as follows: URR is defined as URR = (C0 − C)/C0; although URR correlates well with spKt/V in population studies, there is significant variability in individuals because URR does not include contraction in extracellular volume and urea generation, and for a given Kt/V URR may vary with the fraction of weight lost during dialysis; when outcomes, including death, are correlated with either metric, no difference in degree of correlation is detectable; as kidney replacement level increases, especially with daily treatment, URR approaches zero and is also zero in continuously dialyzed patients or those with normal kidney function; additional limitations include inability to adjust the prescription using modeling; the figure's modeling assumes a 3-hour dialysis, no RKF, and a volume of urea distribution that is 58% of BW, with ΔWt referring to net ultrafiltration losses as a fraction of final BW.

### Blood urea nitrogen / creatinine ratio identifies a high-risk but potentially reversible form of renal dysfunction in patients with decompensated heart failure [^113AJLgx]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Identifying reversible renal dysfunction (RD) in the setting of heart failure is challenging. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether elevated admission blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio (BUN/Cr) could identify decompensated heart failure patients likely to experience improvement in renal function (IRF) with treatment.

Methods and Results

Consecutive hospitalizations with a discharge diagnosis of heart failure were reviewed. IRF was defined as ≥ 20% increase and worsening renal function as ≥ 20% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate. IRF occurred in 31% of the 896 patients meeting eligibility criteria. Higher admission BUN/Cr was associated with in-hospital IRF (odds ratio, 1.5 per 10 increase; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3–1.8; P < 0.001), an association persisting after adjustment for baseline characteristics (odds ratio, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1–1.8; P = 0.004). However, higher admission BUN/Cr was also associated with post-discharge worsening renal function (odds ratio, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1–1.8; P = 0.011). Notably, in patients with an elevated admission BUN/Cr, the risk of death associated with RD (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 45) was substantial (hazard ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.6–3.1; P < 0.001). However, in patients with a normal admission BUN/Cr, RD was not associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.67–2.0; P = 0.59; p interaction = 0.03).

Conclusions

An elevated admission BUN/Cr identifies decompensated patients with heart failure likely to experience IRF with treatment, providing proof of concept that reversible RD may be a discernible entity. However, this improvement seems to be largely transient, and RD, in the setting of an elevated BUN/Cr, remains strongly associated with death. Further research is warranted to develop strategies for the optimal detection and treatment of these high-risk patients.

Figure 4 summarizes adjusted HRs according to subgroups stratified by demographic and clinical characteristics. In all subjects, every 10-mg/dL increase in the BUN level was associated with an increased risk of adverse renal composite outcomes (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.04–1.45). In male subjects, higher BUN levels were associated with a significant increase in the risk of adverse renal composite outcomes. In patients with a higher eGFR, lower serum albumin, and higher proteinuria level, the risk of poor renal outcomes significantly increased as the BUN level increased. In addition, in patients taking diuretics, as the BUN level increased, a significant increase in the risk of a poor renal outcome was found. No significant interactions for renal outcomes, except for use of diuretics (P = 0.02), were observed between BUN levels and other baseline clinical characteristics (P for interaction, 0.06–0.88).

### Elevated blood urea nitrogen level as a predictor of mortality in patients admitted for decompensated heart failure [^115kXGju]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Hospitalization for decompensated heart failure is associated with high mortality after discharge. In heart failure, renal function involves both cardiovascular and hemodynamic properties. We studied the relation between renal dysfunction and mortality in patients admitted for decompensated heart failure.

Methods

The prognostic importance of four measures of renal function-blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio, and estimated creatinine clearance-was evaluated in 541 patients (mean [± SD] age, 63 ± 14 years; 377 men [70%]) with a previous diagnosis of heart failure (96% with New York Heart Association class III or IV symptoms) who were admitted for clinical decompensation.

Results

During a mean follow-up of 343 ± 185 days, 177 patients (33%) died. In multivariable Cox regression models, the risk of all-cause mortality increased with each quartile of blood urea nitrogen, with an adjusted relative risk of 2.3 in patients in the upper compared with the lower quartiles (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3 to 4.1; P = 0.005). Creatinine and estimated creatinine clearance were not significant predictors of mortality after adjustment for other covariates. Blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio yielded similar prognostic information as blood urea nitrogen (adjusted relative risk = 2.3; 95% CI: 1.4 to 3.8; P = 0.0007 for patients in the upper compared with the lower quartiles).

Conclusion

Blood urea nitrogen is a simple clinical variable that provides useful prognostic information in patients admitted for decompensated heart failure. In this setting, elevated blood urea nitrogen levels probably reflect the cumulative effects of hemodynamic and neurohormonal alterations that result in renal hypoperfusion.

### The nonprotein nitrogen level of the blood in renal disease… [^111Vib81]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The accumulation of nitrogenous compounds in the blood constitutes the most characteristic biochemical change of renal insufficiency. The degree of retention is variously expressed in terms of the concentration of blood urea, blood urea nitrogen, or nonprotein nitrogen, and this may occasionally cause confusion. The BUN, widely used in the United States, and the blood urea level, more frequently employed in Europe, can be used interchangeably. The NPN however cannot be accurately converted to BUN. Use of the NPN in clinical medicine stems from the earlier difficulties of measuring blood urea. At the present time, urea determinations are readily available and use of the NPN can no longer be recommended. However, since many laboratories continue to estimate NPN, its significance and its relation to the more commonly used BUN must be understood. The NPN of blood includes all nitrogen that is Dunea G, Freedman P.

### Clinical and dietary indicators associated with uremic status in hospitalized dialysis patients [^112LG4Ug]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to determine whether any differences existed between specific admission variables and uremic status in patients with chronic renal failure receiving dialysis.

Design and Setting

This was a prospective, observational study conducted at BryanLGH Medical Center East Campus in Lincoln, Nebraska.

Patients

The subjects were hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients admitted to an acute care facility, who met the following inclusion criteria: (1) they had a primary or secondary underlying diagnosis of chronic renal failure, and (2) they were not receiving parenteral or enteral tube feeding nutritional support on admission.

Intervention

The patients were separated into 2 groups by their blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentrations. Group 1 had a BUN concentration less than 50 and group 2 had a BUN concentration greater than or equal to 50. Admission data (age, sex, percentage of ideal body weight, reported retrospective weight loss over time, type of dialysis, gastrointestinal history, BUN and creatinine concentrations, and dietary prescription) were collected from patient medical records. Two-day kilocalorie and protein counts were conducted on the patients within 24 hours of admission to the acute care facility. Chi-square and 1-way analysis of variance were performed to compare the groups.

Results

The total number of participants in the study was 42, with 21 in each BUN group. The mean age was 60 years, and the dietary intake was a mean of 10 kcal/kg and 0.4 g protein/kg. Only 14.3% and 7.1% of the patients met their kcal and protein needs, respectively. The mean percentage ideal body weight was 125 and the mean reported weight loss per week was 2.6 pounds. Gastrointestinal symptoms, specifically nausea and a kilocalorie-restricted diet prescription, were significantly different between the 2 groups. Patients in group 2 were more likely to have gastrointestinal symptoms overall (P < .05) specifically, nausea (P < .05). Group 1 patients were also more frequently placed on a kilocalorie-restricted diet (P < .05) than patients in group 2.

Conclusions

A BUN concentration between 50 and 110 has been shown to be associated with a lower risk of death and a better nutritional status. These findings indicate symptoms commonly associated with uremia, such as nausea, may be associated with the dialysis patient's nutritional status when BUN concentrations are greater than 50. These dialysis patients were not receiving sufficient kilocalories and protein on admission into the hospital, and this can affect their nutritional and, eventually, survival status.

### Reconsidering the lack of urea toxicity in dialysis patients [^112ypsjE]. Seminars in Dialysis (2016). Low credibility.

Urea is an old uremic toxin which has been used for many years as a global biomarker of CKD severity and dialysis adequacy. Old studies were not in favor of its role as a causal factor in the pathogenesis of complications associated with the uremic state. However, recent experimental and clinical evidence is compatible with both direct and indirect toxicity of urea, particularly via the deleterious actions of urea-derived carbamylated molecules. Further studies are clearly needed to explore the potential relevance of urea-related CKD complications for patient management, in particular the place of new therapeutic strategies to prevent urea toxicity.

### Elevated blood urea nitrogen-to-creatinine ratio increased the risk of coronary artery disease in patients living with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^111gczJR]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

High Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) and high Serum Creatinine (SCr) levels are risk factors for Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). However, the relationship between the Blood Urea Nitrogen to Creatinine (BUN/SCr) ratio (UCR) and the risk of CAD in patients living with new-onset diabetes is unclear. This study aimed to examine the relationship between blood UCR and the risk of CAD in patients living with new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Methods

We analyzed the data from the cohort of 12,299 patients living with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Primary endpoints were the events of CAD. The ANOVA test (continuous indicators) and χ 2 test (categorical indicators) were used to assess the differences of baseline characteristics across the groups of UCR. In order to understand the correlation between variables, we performed correlation analysis on variables that have significant differences between CAD group and non-CAD group. Multivariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression models were applied to estimate the association of the blood UCR with the risk of CAD in patients living with T2DM. The Kaplan-Meier survival function plotting and the log-rank test were used to evaluate the event-free survival according to the groups of UCR. The restricted cubic spline model was used to show the adjusted association between blood UCR and risk of CAD in patients living with T2DM.

Results

During a median follow-up of 2.66 years, 1173 CAD were recorded with an event rate of 28.49 events per 1000 person-years. In multivariate-adjusted Cox regression models, elevated blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (UCR) was associated with higher risk of CAD in patients living with T2DM [hazard ratio (HR), 1.782; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.237–2.567]. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated that the high group of UCR tended to have a lower event-free survival than the low group and medium group. There was a nonlinear trend toward increasing risk of CAD across the groups of UCR. And cubic spline function graph suggested that the influence of UCR level on HR for CAD increased significantly at UCR levels above 6.67.

Conclusions

An elevated UCR was significantly associated with an increased risk for CAD in patients living with T2DM.

### Blood and breath profiles of volatile organic compounds in patients with end-stage renal disease [^114NyGWi]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) usually is a progressive disorder and patients with end stage renal failure need treatment by transplantation or dialysis. Even though dialysis is lifesaving, overall patient mortality by far exceeds that of an age-matched population without CKD. This is at least in part due to the fact that current dialysis techniques cannot completely replace native kidney function. Guidelines recommend that dialysis dose should be prescribed based on measures of urea clearance even though it is recognized that urea is only a weak surrogate for the extent of uremia. However other, potentially more relevant toxins cannot be determined easily due to technical difficulties and a rapid, low-cost measurement method, which could be used routinely during each HD session, would be highly desirable. Breath gas analysis could meet the requirements as it is non-invasive and breath biomarkers have already proved to provide valuable information on disease processes, or metabolic disorders occurring even in distant parts of the body. Relying on simple-in-use, hand-held, and sensitive devices this diagnostic technique could considerably support the HD treatment.

The composition of uremic breath and its evolution during hemodialysis has already received some attention. Simenhoff et al. reported elevated levels of dimethylamine (DMA) and trimethylamine (TMA) in patients with end-stage renal disease and their decrease after the HD treatment. In case of TMA this response to HD has been confirmed by Endre et al. A number of studies investigated breath ammonia during dialysis as a potential marker of efficiency of this treatment. The observed drop in NH 3 concentrations correlated reasonably well with blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine. Monitoring of breath ethane in HD patients evidenced a rapid rise of this marker during the first minutes after initiation of dialysis, which has been attributed to treatment-induced oxidative stress. Numerous investigators reported a significant increase of isoprene in breath during and after hemodialysis, but not during peritoneal dialysis. Recently, Lee et al. employing breath analysis documented the exposure of dialyzed populations to some hydrocarbons and halocarbons emitted by dialyzer materials.

### Cross-sectional examination of metabolites and metabolic phenotypes in uremia [^113MavjN]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

End stage renal disease (ESRD) is characterized by various metabolic disturbances linked to adverse outcomes, but the nature of these associations is poorly understood or even counterintuitive. For example, low serum albumin has consistently been linked to cardiovascular mortality in dialysis, yet the association is not simply a result of inadequate nutrition, as intradialytic parenteral nutrition does not always improve survival in malnourished ESRD patients, and alternative pathways including inflammation are known to contribute. Dyslipidemia is also common in ESRD, including atherogenic increases in carbamylated and oxidized-LDL cholesterol. Clinical trials, however, have failed to demonstrate a survival benefit with statin therapy in ESRD, despite substantial reductions in LDL cholesterol. Indeed, several studies have identified an inverse association between cholesterol levels and uremic cardiovascular risk. Similar paradoxical associations, sometimes described as examples of 'reverse epidemiology' in ESRD, have been noted with body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure and survival on hemodialysis.

### Nonlinear association between blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio and obstructive sleep apnea: a cross-sectional study from NHANES [^115FWUAA]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

However, a multitude of studies have produced varying results, emphasizing the urgent need for additional research and exploration. For instance, a retrospective study conducted in China, which meticulously examined the medical records of a large cohort of patients, found no association between CR and BUN levels and the AHI. This study, which spanned over several years and involved a diverse group of participants, aimed to shed light on the potential biochemical markers of sleep apnea. Similarly, another study, which employed a different methodology and was conducted in a different geographical region, reported no significant correlation between blood urea nitrogen and the AHI. This research, which utilized advanced statistical techniques to analyze its data, sought to understand the complex relationship between renal function and sleep-disordered breathing. These findings, while not definitive, may indicate that there is no clear correlation between BUN and CR levels with OSA. They suggest that other factors may play a more significant role in the pathophysiology of OSA, and that further investigation is warranted to unravel the intricate mechanisms underlying this prevalent sleep disorder. The results of this study reveal that BUCR may serve as a novel biomarker for the early identification of OSA patients. The finding provides a potential adjunct to the diagnosis and treatment of clinical OSA patients.

### An isolated elevation in blood urea level is not' uraemia' and not an indication for renal replacement therapy in the ICU [^113uisNb]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Currently there is no well-established upper-limit of serum urea that serves as an indication for initiation of RRT in AKI. Using urea in isolation is difficult and potentially flawed given the variation in base level and production rates amongst different populations as well as it's negligibility as an accurate measure of metabolite toxicity. Furthermore, AKI is a multifactorial condition and it is likely to present earlier with other concerning metabolic or fluid overload abnormalities requiring dialysis rather than isolated elevated blood urea levels. Studies have considered the appropriate timing of initial RRT including early and delayed/late commencement of therapy, with a recent meta-analysis concluding there is no added benefit. Most studies initiated RRT once blood urea level exceeded 40 mmol/L, which is reflected in clinical practice despite evidence to suggest it does not correlate well with onset of uraemic symptoms.

Although the appropriate upper limit remains unclear, it is reasonable to conclude that a blood urea level less than 40 mmol/L is not in itself an indication for RRT therapy, especially in the absence of supporting evidence of kidney impairment (anuria, elevated serum creatinine), presenting a welcome reminder to treat the patient and not a number.

### Protein carbamylation and chronic kidney disease progression in the chronic renal insufficiency cohort study [^113LrM7n]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Protein carbamylation is a post-translational protein modification caused, in part, by exposure to urea's dissociation product cyanate. Carbamylation is linked to cardiovascular outcomes and mortality in dialysis-dependent end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), but its effects in earlier pre-dialysis stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are not established.

Methods

We conducted two nested case-control studies within the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study. First, we matched 75 cases demonstrating CKD progression [50% estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reduction or reaching ESKD] to 75 controls (matched on baseline eGFR, 24-h proteinuria, age, sex and race). In the second study, we similarly matched 75 subjects who died during follow-up (cases) to 75 surviving controls. Baseline carbamylated albumin levels (C-Alb, a validated carbamylation assay) were compared between cases and controls in each study.

Results

At baseline, in the CKD progression study, other than blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and smoking status, there were no significant differences in any matched or other parameter. In the mortality group, the only baseline difference was smoking status. Adjusting for baseline differences, the top tertile of C-Alb was associated with an increased risk of CKD progression [odds ratio (OR) = 7.9; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9–32.8; P = 0.004] and mortality (OR = 3.4; 95% CI 1.0–11.4; P = 0.05) when compared with the bottom tertile. C-Alb correlated with eGFR but was more strongly correlated with BUN.

Conclusions

Our data suggest that protein carbamylation is a predictor of CKD progression, beyond traditional risks including eGFR and proteinuria. Carbamylation's association with mortality was smaller in this limited sample size.

### Approaches to uremia [^111vUG4T]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

The development of dialysis was a dramatic step forward in medicine, allowing people who would soon have died because of lack of kidney function to remain alive for years. We have since found, however, that the "artificial kidney" does not live up fully to its name. Dialysis keeps patients alive but not well. Part of the residual illness that dialysis patients experience is caused by retained waste solutes that dialysis does not remove as well as native kidney function does. New means are available to identify these toxic solutes, about which we currently know remarkably little, and knowledge of these solutes would help us to improve therapy. This review summarizes our current knowledge of toxic solutes and highlights methods being explored to identify additional toxic solutes and to enhance the clearance of these solutes to improve patient outcomes.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for hemodialysis adequacy: 2015 update [^112VGHtN]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Limitations of the guidelines — clinical outcomes are optimized when the patient is treated with the delivered dose of dialysis recommended, but because dose as small‑solute clearance is a composite measure, an occasional patient may generate toxins at a rate well above average and therefore require more dialysis than recommended. Clinicians should be alert to subtle symptoms and signs of kidney failure that may indicate a need for more dialysis or a different dialysis modality. After the immediate life‑threatening effects of uremia have been controlled by standard hemodialysis, the patient is often left with symptoms and objective disorders termed a "residual syndrome", whose combined effect may account for the relatively high yearly mortality rate observed in the dialysis population; in many cases, relief from specific aspects of the syndrome requires additional treatments that may not yet be available to clinicians.

### Successful twin pregnancy in a patient with lupus erythematosus on hemodialysis: a case report and literature review [^113yGdZv]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Due to irregular menstruation and hormonal state in ESRD, detection of pregnancy is often delayed, in the mean to 16.5 WOG. This can bear deleterious effects on fetal development, e.g. due to continuation of teratogenic medication – as happened to our patient previously – or delay of a beneficial intensification of dialysis.

Augmentation of HD time from < 18 h/week to 37–56 h/week during gestation was related to a significant increase in live birth rate (85% vs. 48%), gestational age at delivery (38 vs. 28 weeks) and median birth weight (2.6 kg vs. 1.8 kg), but means a high burden for the patient. Some authors consider it sufficient raising the dialysis dose to at least 20 h/week to achieve a serum BUN level below 50 mg/dL, but state a further augmentation to 24 h/week as beneficial. We chose a HD dose (25 h/week to 27.5 h/week) which led to a good outcome of 100% live birth rate in another setting. Evidently, the extent of maternal uremia rather than the duration of dialysis itself largely determines the pregnancy outcome in dialysis patients. Serum BUN levels and both birth weight and gestational age were negatively correlated: BUN levels < 48–49 mg/dL (≈ serum urea 102 mg/dL) corresponded to a birth weight > 1500 g and a gestational age > 32 WOG. Maternal uremia is thought to cause a fetal solute diuresis resulting in polyhydramnios, which itself can lead to premature birth, so there is a recent trend to target even lower BUN levels < 35 mg/dL. In our case, most blood tests showed completely normal pre-dialysis serum urea values of 20–48 mg/dL and polyhydramnios did not occur. A similar reduction of uremia by nocturnal dialysis of 48 ± 5 h/week could achieve almost full term pregnancies. We see both birth weight and gestational age in our case acceptable compared to the data reported in non -twin dialysis pregnancies.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^116vQkDY]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Hemodialysis adequacy — postdialysis blood sampling (Guideline 3) specifies that when adequacy is assessed by predialysis and postdialysis blood urea nitrogen (BUN), blood samples should be drawn by using certain acceptable procedures, and both samples (predialysis and postdialysis) should be drawn during the same treatment session. To prevent underestimation of the predialysis value, the risk of underestimating predialysis BUN level because of saline dilution or by sampling the blood after treatment has begun should be avoided; the predialysis BUN sample must be drawn before dialysis is started and dilution with saline or heparin must be avoided. For the postdialysis sample, the risk of underestimating the postdialysis BUN level because of access recirculation (AR) should be avoided by first slowing the blood flow through the dialyzer to a rate at which AR is expected to be minimal (100 mL/min) for a period long enough to ensure that unrecirculated blood has advanced to below the sampling port (usually 15 seconds). Postdialysis urea nitrogen rebound has 3 components: AR resolves within seconds after stopping dialysis, CAPR resolves within 1 to 2 minutes, and remote-compartment (RC) rebound resolves within 30 to 60 minutes. Because AR causes large overestimations and can result in true delivered Kt/V values less than 0.8 in patients with apparent Kt/V values of 1.4 or greater, proper timing for acquisition of the postdialysis BUN sample is critical.

### Blood urea nitrogen-to-creatinine ratio in the general population and in patients with acute heart failure [^1119E4Lu]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The blood urea nitrogen-to-creatinine (BUN/creatinine) ratio has been proposed as a useful parameter in acute heart failure (AHF), but data on the normal range and the added value of the ratio compared with its separate components in patients with AHF are lacking. The aim of this study is to define the normal range of BUN/creatinine ratio and to investigate its clinical significance in patients with AHF.

Methods

In 4484 subjects from the general population without cardiovascular comorbidities, we calculated age-specific and sex-specific normal values of the BUN/creatinine ratio, deriving a higher and lower than normal range of BUN/creatinine ratio (exceeding the 95% prediction intervals). Association of abnormal range to prognosis was tested in 2033 patients with AHF for the outcome of all-cause death through 180days, death or cardiovascular or renal rehospitalisation through 60days and heart failure (HF) rehospitalisation within 60days.

Results

In a cohort of patients with AHF, 482 (24.6%) and 28 (1.4%) patients with HF were classified into higher and lower than normal range groups, respectively. In Cox regression analysis, higher than normal range of BUN/creatinine ratio group was an independent predictor for all-cause death (HR: 1.86, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.66) and death or cardiovascular or renal rehospitalisation (HR: 1.37, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.82), but not for HF rehospitalisation (HR: 1.23, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.86) after adjustment for other prognostic factors including both creatinine and BUN.

Conclusions

In patients with AHF, BUN/creatinine higher than age-specific and sex-specific normal range is associated with worse prognosis independently from both creatinine and BUN. CLINICAL TRIALS: gov identifier NCT00328692 and NCT00354458.

### Blood urea nitrogen is independently associated with renal outcomes in Japanese patients with stage 3–5 chronic kidney disease: a prospective observational study [^115GufkV]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Higher BUN levels were identified as a risk factor for kidney disease progression in patients with moderate to severe CKD, independent of eGFR. Although cSosm levels increased together with BUN levels, they were not independently associated with a poor outcome. Additionally, based on the sensitivity analysis, it is also suggested that BUN levels are associated with adverse renal outcomes, independent of kidney function. Our findings suggest that the measurement of BUN levels may be useful for predicting renal outcomes.

### The urea-to-creatinine ratio is predictive of worsening kidney function in ambulatory heart failure patients [^117YHNre]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Changes in kidney function in heart failure patients convey important prognostic information. We investigated the association of the urea-to-creatinine (BUN/Cr) ratio, the fractional excretion of urea (FeUr), and the fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) and subsequent declines in kidney function in ambulatory heart failure patients.

Methods and Results

We prospectively enrolled adult patients with ejection fraction < 40% at a multidisciplinary heart failure clinic and measured serial measurements of laboratory values from September 2008 to July 2011. The study outcome was changes in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). In 138 patients contributing 10,350 patient-hours of follow-up, we found that participants with a decline of > 25% in eGFR had higher mean BUN/Cr ratio (0.110 ± 0.043 vs 0.086 ± 0.026; p = 0.02) and no difference in the FeNa (1.81 vs 1.43; p = 0.2) or FeUr (32.3 vs 37.2; p = 0.9) compared with those with no change. There was an association of BUN/Cr ratio with the rate of change of eGFR (coefficient -25.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] -10.99 to -40.35; P < .0001). The BUN/Cr ratio was an independent predictor of eGFR drop > 25% (odds ratio 1.19, 95% CI 1.07–1.32) and improved model discrimination (c-statistic increased from 0.624 to 0.693) and reclassification (net reclassification index 11.38% [P < .0001], integrated discrimination improvement 5.24% [P = 0.02]).

Conclusions

The BUN/Cr ratio is associated with worsening kidney function and adds incremental risk prediction information relative to traditional predictive measures in outpatients with heart failure at risk for worsening kidney disease.

### The urea-to-creatinine ratio as an emerging biomarker in critical care: a scoping review and meta-analysis [^114DV2at]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Lastly, recognising that the UCR is reported in disparate units is also crucial. In Europe, the urea/creatinine ratio is frequently used, whereas in the United States, the blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine ratio is commonly reported. Conversion factors are available for calculating BUN, which is approximately one-half (28/60 or 0.446) of blood urea. It is essential to ensure that both BUN or urea and creatinine are reported in the same units to ensure the accuracy of the ratio calculation (Fig. 4). Standardisation in reporting facilitates comparison between studies and provides a uniform approach to assessing patient outcomes and formulating clinical decision-making.

Fig. 4
Conversion factors BUN and urea. The chemical formula of urea is CO(NH₂)₂, with a molecular weight of approximately 60. Each of the two nitrogen molecules has a weight of approximately 14 g/mol. The ratio 60/28 can be expressed as follows: To convert from BUN to urea, one must multiply by 2.14. Similarly, to convert from urea to BUN, one must divide by 2.14. To convert from mg/dL to mmol/L for BUN and urea, the value should be multiplied by the weight in mol and then multiplied by 10 to convert L to dL. For BUN, this is 2 × nitrogen (2 × 14 = 10/28 = 0.357), while for urea it is CO(NH₂)₂ (10/60 = 0.166). Both BUN and urea in mmol/L are molecular weight units and can be converted without the use of a conversion factor. All of these values are approximations and have been rounded for simplicity.

Hemodialysis adequacy — standard clearance (stdK) is described as a continuous equivalent of dialyzer clearance obtained by normalizing the predialysis blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and favored by the Work Group as an alternative to inflating Kt for non-continuous treatments; it "is the continuous clearance that maintains the BUN at a constant value equal to the average predialysis BUN achieved during intermittent dialysis".

### Blood urea nitrogen, blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio and incident stroke: the dongfeng-tongji cohort [^114N3R46]. Atherosclerosis (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

It remains unclear whether extreme levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and BUN to creatinine ratio (BUN/Cr) can increase future risk of stroke. We conducted this study to investigate the associations of BUN and BUN/Cr with incident stroke and its subtypes.

Methods

A total of 26,835 and 26,379 participants with a mean follow-up of 7.9 years were included to investigate the associations of BUN and BUN/Cr with incident stroke, respectively. Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for incident stroke and its subtypes.

Results

Compared with participants in the third quintile of BUN, the adjusted HRs (95% CIs) for participants in the lowest quintile were 1.21 (1.04–1.40), 1.41 (1.18–1.68) and 1.36 (0.97–1.91) for total, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, respectively; while for those in the highest quintile, the corresponding HRs (95% CIs) were 1.16 (1.01–1.32), 1.30 (1.11–1.53), and 1.24 (0.90–1.71). The associations remained robust when restricting the analyses to participants within clinically normal range of BUN. For BUN/Cr, compared with participants in the third quintile, participants in the lowest quintile had significant higher risks of stroke (HRs [95% CIs] were 1.19 [1.04–1.37], 1.26 [1.07–1.48], and 1.22 [0.90–1.67] for total, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke).

Conclusions

Both high and low levels of BUN were associated with higher risks of total and ischemic stroke. Low level of BUN/Cr was associated with excess risks of total and ischemic stroke.

Renal dysfunction — acute kidney injury (AKI) and renal findings in COVID-19 include that a meta-analysis of COVID-19 patients (n = 1,558) found no correlation between an elevated risk for COVID-19 and renal disease; AKI developed in 5% to 15% of those infected with the SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, and initial reports of AKI in COVID-19 patients stated rates of 3% to 9%; in a study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n = 59), 34% developed massive albuminuria on the day they were admitted and 63% developed proteinuria over the course of their hospital stay; in 27% of COVID-19 patients blood urea nitrogen levels were abnormally high and BUN was elevated in two- thirds of patients who died of COVID; COVID-19 may complicate care for patients on dialysis, since these patients are already at elevated risk for infection, and dialysis patients must continue with their treatments.

### Update of dialysis initiation timing in end stage kidney disease patients: is it a resolved question? A systematic literature review [^114TjdSP]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The exact optimal timing of dialysis for ESKD patients remains unknown. This study systematically reviewed the available evidence with regard to the optimal initiation of maintenance dialysis in ESKD patients.

Methods

An electronic search was performed in Embase, PubMed and the Cochrane Library in order to find studies investigating associations between variables reference to "start of dialysis" and outcomes. Quality assessment and bias assessment were performed by the Newcastle-Ottawa scale and the ROBINSI tool. Due to the heterogeneity of studies, a meta-analysis could not be performed.

Results

Thirteen studies were included; four studies included only haemodialysis patients, three peritoneal dialysis, six both; study outcomes included mortality, cardiovascular events, technique failure, quality of life and others. Nine studies mainly focused on the optimal GFR of maintenance dialysis initiation; five studies showed none association between GFR and mortality or other adverse outcomes, two studies showed dialysis initiation at higher GFR levels were with poor prognosis, and 2 studies showed higher GFR levels with better prognosis. Three studies paid attention to comprehensive assessment of uremic signs and/or symptoms for optimal dialysis initiation; uremic burden based on 7 uremic indicators (hemoglobin, serum albumin, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, potassium, phosphorus, and bicarbonate) were not associated with mortality; another equation (combination of sex, age, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, serum albumin, haemoglobin, serum phosphorus, diabetes mellitus, and heart failure) based on fuzzy mathematics to assess the timing of haemodialysis initiation was accuracy to prognose 3-year survival; the third study found that volume overload or hypertension was associated with the highest risk for subsequent mortality. Two studies compared urgent or optimal start in dialysis, a study reported increased survival in optimal start patients, another reported no differences between Urgent-Start-PD and Early-Start-PD regarding 6-month outcomes.

Limitations

Heterogeneity among the studies was quite high, with differences in sample size, variable and group characteristics; no RCT studies were included, which weakened the strength of evidences.

Conclusions

The criteria for dialysis initiation were varied. Most studies proved that GFR at dialysis initiation was not associated with mortality, timing of dialysis initiation should not be based on GFR, assessments of volume load and patient's tolerance to volume overload are prospective approaches.

### Association of blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio and long-term outcome among women with coronary artery bypass grafting surgery: filling gaps in female [^117Tghi9]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have established an association between the BUN/Cr ratio and adverse outcomes in various cardiovascular conditions. Specifically, a higher admission BUN/Cr ratio predicts increased in-hospital mortality in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients, even after multivariable adjustment, and elevated ratios are independently associated with higher long-term all-cause mortality in acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) patients. In contrast, our study identifies the BUN/Cr ratio as a valuable prognostic marker in female patients undergoing CABG, where a higher ratio is associated with reduced mortality. This apparent contradiction likely stems from divergent pathophysiological mechanisms reflected by the BUN/Cr ratio across different cardiovascular states. In female CABG patients, an elevated ratio primarily signifies effective perioperative volume management (achieved through active diuresis and fluid restriction), resulting in relative volume deficit. This contrasts with AMI and ADHF, where a high ratio typically indicates pathological renal hypoperfusion secondary to severe cardiac dysfunction.

We utilized RCS functions to analyze the dose-response relationship regarding long-term outcomes. Our findings reveal an L-shaped association between BUN/Cr levels and HRs for all-cause mortality (Turning point 17.308), when it is below the turning point (< 17.308), the low ratio reflects volume overload or renal tubular dysfunction (such as insufficient diuresis, chronic kidney disease), leading to increased cardiac burden, pulmonary edema, and increased risk of kidney injury. This may be due to surgical stress or postoperative pulmonary edema and kidney injury, which significantly increases the risk of death (HR 0.814, with an increase of 18.6% for every 1 unit decrease in risk); When the ratio is higher than the inflection point (≥ 17.308), the increase in the ratio is mainly due to successful volume management (strict fluid limitation and diuresis to achieve mild dehydration), avoiding damage to the heart caused by volume overload, and patients with good renal tubular function can tolerate this state, putting the risk of death into a safe plateau period (HR 0.985 showed no significant change), until the ratio is extremely high before it may turn harmful. The inflection point value of 17.308 has therefore become a key target for postoperative volume control. These results highlight the critical importance of managing BUN/Cr levels in the clinical care of female CABG patients.

### Blood urea nitrogen is independently associated with renal outcomes in Japanese patients with stage 3–5 chronic kidney disease: a prospective observational study [^111HYDNV]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Urea is the primary metabolite derived from dietary protein and tissue protein turnover. It is freely filtered at the glomerulus but not secreted, and it is reabsorbed by the renal tubules. In addition, as urine flow rates decrease, more urea is reabsorbed. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) measures the nitrogen component of serum urea. BUN levels are inversely correlated with the decline of kidney function and are also affected by extrarenal factors such as protein intake, gastrointestinal bleeding, catabolic states, malnutrition, heart failure, dehydration, use of glucocorticoids, and hepatic urea synthesis.

Under physiologic conditions urea slowly dissociates into cyanate, which is rapidly converted to isocyanate. Isocyanate is a reactive electrophile with high affinity for nucleophilic groups such as primary amines. Carbamylation has been recognized to be a spontaneous post-translational modification of amino acids and proteins mediated by cyanate, leading to biochemical alterations. It has also been demonstrated that urea can exert direct toxicity on various tissues such as the intestinal epithelium, vascular walls, pancreatic β-cells and adipocytes, and indirect toxicity via carbamylation. Notably, BUN levels are associated with mortality among patients with heart failure.

Experimental studies have demonstrated that the release of vasopressin and the activation of the aldose reductase-fructokinase pathway caused by the elevated serum osmolality might be associated with kidney injury. BUN is one of the substances that affects the calculated serum osmolality (cSosm) levels. Therefore, in patients in advanced stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD), there is a concomitant rise in cSosm and BUN levels. Furthermore, a recent study showed that higher BUN and cSosm levels were independently associated with the development of CKD, which was defined as a decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in patients with preserved kidney function (average eGFR of 86.7 mL/min/1.73 m 2). However, it remains unclear whether high BUN or cSosm levels are an independent risk factor for kidney disease progression in patients with moderate to severe CKD. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine whether the BUN or cSosm level is associated with adverse renal outcomes in patients with CKD (stages 3–5) independent of the eGFR. Additionally, a previous study demonstrated that eGFR and serum creatinine were associated with kidney disease progression in CKD patients. Thus, we also evaluated whether BUN levels were related to CKD progression, independent of an alternative kidney function marker, serum creatinine.

Hemodialysis adequacy — minimally adequate HD research needs and dosing metrics are highlighted as follows: mortality data are lacking and no randomized controlled trial (RCT) of mortality is expected soon, while an ongoing RCT may address hospitalization and is powered for quality of life (QOL) and left ventricular mass index outcomes; validation of stop-blood-flow and stop-dialysate-flow dosing methods in children requires future research; studies are needed to test whether monthly predialysis blood urea nitrogen (BUN) alone with quarterly pre/post BUN values provides the same information as monthly pre- and postdialysis BUN for protein catabolic rate; and further study should evaluate dosing based on Kecn × T/BSA with a correction factor varying to the 2/3 power and the ratio of modeled to anthropometric volume.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^114qNwAx]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Hemodialysis adequacy — impact of residual urea clearance (Kr) on BUN dynamics is described as follows: residual kidney function (RKF) contributes little to the decrease in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) during dialysis, but Kr lowers the predialysis BUN level during the long interdialysis interval; when Kr is zero the interdialysis BUN rise is linear in the absence of fluid gain, whereas if Kr is greater than zero the interdialysis increase is curvilinear and concave downward, yielding a lower predialysis BUN so less hemodialysis (HD) is required to maintain the same average BUN level.

### The importance of low blood urea nitrogen levels in pregnant patients undergoing hemodialysis to optimize birth weight and gestational age [^115chob9]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Most published reports indicate that intensified hemodialysis results in better pregnancy outcomes. Here we studied clinical characteristics and the outcomes of 28 pregnant women receiving hemodialysis. We found an association between maternal blood data and birth weight, and gestational age and outcomes. There were 18 surviving infants who were followed up for one year. In the others there were 4 spontaneous abortions, 1 stillbirth, 3 neonatal deaths and 2 deaths after birth. Analysis of blood chemistry for 20 pregnancies from 12 weeks of gestation until delivery showed that the average hemoglobin level was significantly higher in the group that successfully delivered than in the unsuccessful group. There were significant negative relationships between the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level and the birth weight or gestational age in the latter cohort. A birth weight equal to or greater than 1500 g or a gestational age equal to or exceeding 32 weeks corresponded to BUN levels of 48–49 mg/dl or less. Whether the low BUN is the direct cause of the improved outcome remains to be examined.

### An isolated elevation in blood urea level is not' uraemia' and not an indication for renal replacement therapy in the ICU [^1178DFgo]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

The decision to initiate renal replacement therapy (RRT) and the optimal timing for commencement is a difficult decision faced by clinicians when treating acute kidney injury (AKI) in the intensive care setting. Without clinically significant ureamic symptoms or emergent indications (electrolyte abnormalities, volume overload) the timing of RRT initiation remains contentious and inconsistent across health providers. Current trends of initiating RRT in the ICU are often based on isolated blood urea levels without clear guidelines demonstrating an upper limit for treatment. Although the appropriate upper limit remains unclear, it is reasonable to conclude that a blood urea level less than 40 mmol/L is not in itself an indication for RRT, especially in the absence of supporting evidence of kidney impairment (anuria, elevated serum creatinine), presenting a welcome reminder to treat the patient and not a number.

### Relation of blood urea nitrogen to long-term mortality in patients with heart failure [^115g8oew]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with chronic kidney disease and heart failure (HF) have been shown to be at higher risk for major adverse cardiovascular events and death. Recent studies have demonstrated that blood urea nitrogen (BUN) might serve as a powerful predictor of mortality in acutely decompensated HF. The goal of this study was to determine the impact of BUN on long-term mortality in patients with stage B and C HF. Our retrospective analysis included patients undergoing percutaneous intervention with a calculated left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 50%. Patients on dialysis or with technically inadequate left ventriculograms were excluded. Chart review was performed and mortality data were obtained. Our population included 444 patients with a mean ejection fraction of 38 ± 10%, mean age of 59 ± 11 years, median BUN of 14 mg/dl, and median glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 81 ml/min/1.73 m(2); 31% had stage C HF, and 33% died during follow-up. Patients with increased BUN (≥ 17 mg/dl) and decreased GFR (≤ 69 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) had significantly increased long-term mortality on Kaplan-Meier analysis (8-year mortalities of 57% and 55%, respectively). In patients with stage C HF, mortalities at 8 years were 69% and 73% with abnormal BUN and GFR, respectively. Proportional hazard regression analysis demonstrated that BUN and stage C HF were independently associated with increased mortality, whereas GFR was not. In conclusion, we demonstrated that BUN is strongly associated with mortality in patients with stage B and C HF and may serve as a better biomarker than GFR for prognostication.

### A combined-biomarker approach to clinical phenotyping renal dysfunction in heart failure [^112Jqy1B]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Differentiating heart failure (HF) induced renal dysfunction (RD) from intrinsic kidney disease is challenging. It has been demonstrated that biomarkers such as B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or the blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (BUN/creat) can identify high- vs low-risk RD. Our objective was to determine if combining these biomarkers could further improve risk stratification and clinical phenotyping of patients with RD and HF.

Methods and Results

A total of 908 patients with a discharge diagnosis of HF were included. Median values were used to define elevated BNP (> 1296 pg/mL) and BUN/creat (> 17). In the group without RD, survival was similar regardless of BNP and BUN/creat (n = 430, adjusted P = 0.52). Similarly, in patients with both a low BNP and BUN/creat, RD was not associated with mortality (n = 250, adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.6–1.6, P = 0.99). However, in patients with both an elevated BNP and BUN/creat those with RD had a cardiorenal profile characterized by venous congestion, diuretic resistance, hypotension, hyponatremia, longer length of stay, greater inotrope use, and substantially worse survival compared with patients without RD (n = 249, adjusted HR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.2–2.7, P = 0.008, P interaction = .005).

Conclusions

In the setting of decompensated HF, the combined use of BNP and BUN/creat stratifies patients with RD into groups with significantly different clinical phenotypes and prognosis.

The BUN/Creatinine Ratio is a clinical calculator used in the field of nephrology and internal medicine. BUN stands for Blood Urea Nitrogen, a waste product generated in the liver and excreted by the kidneys, while Creatinine is a waste product produced by muscle metabolism and also excreted by the kidneys.

This ratio is primarily used to differentiate between prerenal and renal causes of acute kidney injury (AKI). A high BUN/Creatinine ratio (> 20:1) is typically suggestive of a prerenal cause such as dehydration or decreased blood flow to the kidneys, while a low ratio (< 10:1) is more indicative of intrinsic renal disease or postrenal obstruction.

The BUN/Creatinine Ratio is applicable to patients with suspected kidney disease or injury, or those with known renal conditions where monitoring of renal function is necessary. It is also used in the evaluation of patients with altered mental status or suspected metabolic disorders.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the BUN/Creatinine ratio, but it should be interpreted with caution in patients with liver disease, malnutrition, or those on certain medications that can affect BUN or creatinine levels. It is also important to note that this ratio is

Individuals with diabetes face an increased risk of developing heart failure and chronic kidney disease, and the presence of these comorbidities significantly elevates the incidence and mortality rates in diabetic patients. A large multinational cohort study revealed that heart failure or impaired kidney function is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in diabetes patients, with HR of 2.02 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.75–2.33) and HR 2.05 (95% CI 1.82–2.32), respectively. Moreover, diabetic patients with the combination of heart failure and impaired kidney function showed the highest risk of all-cause mortality (HR 3.14, 95% CI 2.90–3.40). Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) serves as an objective marker for heart failure. In a Japanese study investigating the relationship between BNP levels and the prognosis of diabetic kidney disease, it was found that baseline BNP levels were associated with the prognosis of diabetic kidney disease after a follow-up period of seven years. Significantly different progression of diabetic kidney disease, cardiovascular events, and mortality risks were observed between individuals with low BNP and high BNP levels.

In contrast to the sociodemographic characteristics mentioned earlier, laboratory indicators provide a more objective reflection of patients' physical condition and disease status. The use of biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis has become increasingly common. According to our study, certain laboratory parameters in diabetic kidney disease patients show correlations with all-cause mortality. In our study, there was a negative correlation between serum albumin levels and overall mortality in diabetic kidney disease patients. Albumin is a crucial indicator reflecting the nutritional status within the body. Higher serum albumin levels in diabetic patients are significantly associated with a lower risk of microvascular complications related to diabetes. Research suggests that individuals with lower serum albumin levels in the diabetic kidney disease population are more prone to progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), leading to an unfavorable prognosis. Uric acid and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, on the other hand, show a positive correlation with all-cause mortality. The role of uric acid in diabetic kidney disease is not fully understood, but several studies suggest that sustained elevated uric acid levels may have a continuous impact on renal function in diabetic kidney disease patients, potentially leading to kidney damage and the occurrence of ESRD. BUN, as one of the metabolic indicators in the body, directly reflects the patient's renal function status. Elevated BUN levels often indicate ongoing deterioration of kidney function.

### Blood urea nitrogen is independently associated with renal outcomes in Japanese patients with stage 3–5 chronic kidney disease: a prospective observational study [^111BZpFe]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patients and study design

Six hundred eighty-two consecutive Japanese patients with CKD stage 3–5 were admitted to our hospital, the National Hospital Organization Kyushu Medical Center, for evaluation and education about CKD between June 2009 and December 2017. Figure 1 shows a flow chart of the patient enrollment process. To decrease the effects of extrarenal factors on BUN levels, patients who used corticosteroids at a dose > 5 mg/day, or who had an active gastric ulcer or hemorrhagic gastritis, liver cirrhosis, or a left ventricular ejection fraction < 40% were excluded. Four hundred fifty-nine patients were analyzed. After discharge, patients were prospectively followed at our hospital for at least 6 months. Data were collected until July 2018. The composite renal endpoint was end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or death, whichever occurred first, and ESRD alone was added as an alternative outcome. ESRD was defined as renal dysfunction requiring renal replacement therapy such as maintenance hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis or having undergone kidney transplantation. When the patients showed gradual worsening of kidney function during follow-up and were determined to require renal replacement therapy, they were diagnosed with ESRD and were re-admitted for renal replacement therapy. Time to ESRD was defined as the duration from baseline to the day of the first dialysis session or the kidney transplantation procedure. Death occurred before reaching ESRD. Information regarding patient death and definitions of censored patients are described in our previous report. In total, 69 patients were censored; 63 were lost to follow-up and 6 required maintenance hemodialysis because of acute exacerbation of kidney function due to infectious diseases or congestive heart failure. As a result, 390 patients were completely followed up until July 2018.

### Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels at admission for mortality risk assessment in patients with acute coronary syndromes [^117DdDX4]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare the prognostic significance of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) versus creatinine levels for estimating the risk of death in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

Methods and Results

A prospective study of all patients admitted with suspected (n = 1613) and retrospectively confirmed (n = 54) myocardial infarction or unstable angina was conducted. The ROC analysis established that the area under the curve for BUN was higher than that of creatinine: 0.76 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.82) and 0.69 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.76), respectively (p = 0.005). The threshold level (that maximised the combined sensitivity and specificity) was 8.8 mmol/l for BUN and 110 mumol/l for creatinine. Sensitivity (true positive cases) was 60% and 55% for threshold levels of BUN and creatinine, respectively, and specificity (true negative cases) was 82% and 77%, respectively. An increase of only BUN levels and a combination of increased BUN and creatinine levels, but not isolated hypercreatinaemia, proved to be the independent risk factors of death from ACS. Separate inclusion of BUN and creatinine as continuous variables in the regression model showed that both were associated with the risk of death: OR 1.22 (95% CI 1.17 to 1.28) and 1.016 (95% CI 1.011 to 1.021) per unit increase (R(2) = 14.5 and 8.4%, respectively). When both were simultaneously included, only an increased BUN level was pertinent to the prognosis of ACS: OR after multivariate adjustment 1.17 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.27).

Conclusion

An increased level of BUN is a more significant risk factor for ACS outcomes than that of creatinine.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^112ZrupL]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Hemodialysis adequacy (CPG 2.3) — urea as a marker is justified because isolated solute levels can mislead, whereas urea clearance from concentration ratios sensitively reflects small‑solute diffusion, making urea Kt/V a sensitive measure of overall dialysis dose. Specifically, "measurement of isolated solute levels can be misleading if the solute measured is not representative of all uremic toxins", "Urea clearance determined from a ratio of concentrations, rather than from an absolute value, is a sensitive marker of small-solute diffusion across the dialyzer", and "urea Kt/V is a sensitive measure of the overall dialysis dose".

### Blood urea nitrogen to serum albumin ratio: a good predictor of in-hospital and 90-day all-cause mortality in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114csv19]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Blood urea nitrogen(BUN) is the nitrogen component in urea, the final product of metabolism, which originates from the liver and is excreted by the kidney. Based on previous research findings, and compared with survivors, a higher BUN level was found in those who died in hospital. In this study, our results also showed that the non-survivor group had a higher BUN level than the survivor group during hospitalization. Thus, we suggest that elevated BUN levels reflect the severity of the disease. In addition, BUN was shown to have a predictive effect on the prognosis of the disease. One retrospective cohort study from China performed by Chen et al. found that an elevated BUN level was related to hospital mortality in COPD patients with exacerbations for those who presented at the emergency department. Figure 2 shows that BUN levels could predict hospitalization outcomes of the hospitalized patients with AECOPD (AUC = 0.85, 95% CI 0.77–0.92, P < 0.001). This was similar to previous findings that indicated elevated BUN levels were associated with increased mortality.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for hemodialysis adequacy: 2015 update [^112cqute]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Hemodialysis initiation — kidney function estimation in advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) should not rely on a specific estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) level; serum creatinine–based equations are influenced by muscle mass and cohorts link higher eGFR at dialysis start with higher mortality without a similar signal using measured clearances. The Work Group elected not to recommend a specific GFR estimating equation for advanced CKD and favored not recommending routine 24-hour urine collections, while recognizing possible utility when uremic symptoms are discordant with measured kidney function.

### Late initiation of renal replacement therapy is associated with worse outcomes in acute kidney injury after major abdominal surgery [^116upmMU]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

In the ICUs, the indications for RRT initiation were: (1) azotemia (BUN > 80 mg/dL and sCr > 2 mg/dl) with uremic symptoms (encephalopathy, nausea, vomiting, etc); (2) oliguria (urine amount < 200 ml/8 hours) or anuria refractory to diuretics; (3) fluid overload refractory to diuretics use with a CVP level above 12 mmHg or pulmonary edema with a partial pressure of arterial oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio below 300 mmHg; (4) hyperkalemia (sK + > 5.5 mmol/L) refractory to medical treatment; and (5) metabolic acidosis (a pH < 7.2 in arterial blood gas). We recorded all the indications of patients upon RRT initiation.

### An isolated elevation in blood urea level is not' uraemia' and not an indication for renal replacement therapy in the ICU [^1167SQgG]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The decision to initiate renal replacement therapy (RRT) and the optimal timing for commencement is a difficult decision clinicians face when treating acute kidney injury (AKI) in the intensive care setting. Without clinically significant ureamic symptoms or emergent indications (electrolyte abnormalities, volume overload) the timing of RRT initiation remains contentious and inconsistent across health providers. The issue is further complicated by several randomised control trials (RCTs) that investigated early versus delayed prescription of RRT producing conflicting results.

Despite the common assumption that elevated urea requires urgent dialysis, treating AKI on serum urea alone is difficult due to variations in the base urea level in the presence of metabolic instability and variations in urea generation. The clinical signs of pathological uraemia (pericarditis, pleuritis, encephalopathy and bleeding) are well established as indications to start haemodialysis, but therapy often commences prior to their development.

It is also common practice to delay haemodialysis for an indefinite period in the absence of these specific uraemic complications due to the risks associated with RRT. However, the question remains, when is the most appropriate time to initiate therapy based on serum urea levels without other apparent indications?

Table 1
Baseline clinical characteristics of patients according to quartiles of BUN levels

Values are expressed as means ± SD, number (percent) or median (IQR).

The median follow-up period was 25.8 months (range, 1.2–95.8 months). At the end of follow-up, 210 patients had reached the composite renal endpoint. Thirty-seven patients died before reaching ESRD. The causes of death were infectious disease in nine patients, sudden death in seven, uremia in five, malignancy in four, cardiac diseases in five, other defined causes in five, and unknown in two.

Kaplan–Meier analysis showed significantly higher rates of renal events in the higher BUN quartiles (Fig. 2). Table 2 shows the HRs for composite renal outcome according to quartiles of BUN or cSosm. In a multivariable analysis (Model 3), higher BUN quartiles had a significantly higher risk of adverse renal outcomes compared with the lowest quartile. In contrast, compared with the lowest cSosm quartile, no significant increase in the risk of poor renal outcomes in the higher quartiles of cSosm was found in Model 3. A spline analysis of the relationship between BUN and the risk of adverse renal outcomes showed that the risk of poor renal outcomes was progressively higher as the BUN level increased (Fig. 3).

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for hemodialysis adequacy: 2015 update [^114UeM3b]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Rationale for Guideline 1.2 — starting kidney replacement therapy should not rely on an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) number alone but on symptoms and preferences: Symptoms of uremia are nonspecific, and attempts should be made to evaluate for other, sometimes reversible, causes of symptoms, and uremic symptoms can be subtle, with patients adapting to lower levels of functioning without clearly expressing symptoms. The decision to initiate KRT should not be based on estimated GFR (eGFR) level alone, and the balance among the benefits, risks, and disadvantages of initiating or not initiating dialysis should be evaluated, taking into account education received and preferences expressed by the patients and/or their caregivers. While no specific numeric threshold is endorsed, the Work Group noted there likely is a floor GFR below which KRT is required, and that there is a level at which delaying for KRT initiation versus electing for conservative care becomes imperative.

### The general picture of uremia [^1121gcVt]. Seminars in Dialysis (2009). Low credibility.

The clinical presentation and manifestations of uremia that constitute the uremic syndrome are presented. The first descriptions of patients with advanced or "terminal" renal failure who were treated with hemodialysis are evoked to illustrate the wide range of signs and symptoms that are associated even to a moderate decrease in renal function, presently referred to as chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 3–4. The kidney is a central organ guaranteeing the maintenance of the "milieu intérieur", where all the cells of the body are generated, develop, proliferate, and die. Chronic kidney disease, by altering the "milieu intérieur", may alter the metabolism of every type of cell or organ, leading to a wide scope of symptoms. The most frequently observed signs in daily clinical practice are summarized and put into the perspective of the renal physician. Disturbances of ion and water metabolism, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, anemia, mineral and bone disorders, endocrine, inmmunologic and neurologic syndromes are described. The addition of these clinical manifestations defines and describes each uremic patient as a specific individual. The pathophysiologic mechanisms by which each of these signs and symptoms appears and the particular compounds responsible for their occurrence, are described in depth in subsequent chapters of this issue.

### Post-ischemic azotemia as a partial'brake', slowing progressive kidney disease [^116UTtTG]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Recent experimental work suggests a paradox: although uremia evokes systemic toxicities, in the setting of AKI, it can induce intrarenal cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. Whether these influences can attenuate post-ischemic kidney disease progression remains unknown.

Methods

To explore this possibility, male CD-1 mice were subjected to a 30-min unilateral (left) kidney ischemia model, previously shown to reduce renal mass by ∼50% over 2–3 weeks. Stepwise azotemia/acute uremia was superimposed by inducing different lengths of contralateral (right) kidney ischemia (0, 15, 18, 20 min). Subsequent loss of left renal mass (kidney weight) was assessed 2 weeks later and contrasted with the degree of initial azotemia 24-h BUN.

Results

A striking correlation between 24-h BUNs and 2-week left renal mass was observed (r, 0.77; P < 0.001). With 20 min of right kidney ischemia, left kidney size was completely preserved. This preservation did not result from increased tubular cell proliferation or decreased microvascular loss, as gauged by KI-67 and CD-34 immunohistochemistry, respectively. Rather, an early reduction in proximal tubule cell dropout (as judged by renal cortical N-acetyl-glucosaminidase content), with a subsequent preservation of tubule mass, was observed.

Conclusions

In summary, these findings advance a novel concept: acute uremia can confer early post-ischemic cytoprotection resulting in a slowed progression of post-ischemic kidney disease.

### Blood urea nitrogen is independently associated with renal outcomes in Japanese patients with stage 3–5 chronic kidney disease: a prospective observational study [^112rf4pi]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is one of the substances that affects the calculated serum osmolality (cSosm). A previous study demonstrated that BUN and cSosm were independently associated with the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients with preserved kidney function. In advanced CKD stages, there is a concomitant increase in cSosm and BUN levels. However, it remains unclear whether BUN or cSosm levels are related to renal outcomes in patients with moderate to severe kidney dysfunction. The aim of this study was to clarify whether the BUN or cSosm level is associated with kidney disease progression in patients with advanced CKD.

Methods

In this prospective study, we enrolled 459 patients with CKD (stages 3–5). The composite renal endpoint was end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or death, and ESRD alone was added as an alternative outcome. A Cox proportional hazards model was utilized to determine the risk factors for a poor renal outcome. We adjusted for covariates including estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The cSosm (mOsm/kg) was calculated using the following formula: (2 × sodium) + (BUN/2.8) + (glucose/18).

Results

During a median follow-up of 25.8 months, the renal endpoint was observed in 210 patients. Multivariable Cox analysis determined the hazard ratio (HR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] for the composite renal outcome in the second, third, and fourth BUN quartiles were 1.36 (0.72–2.58), 1.87 (0.95–3.66), and 2.66 (1.23–5.76) (P for trend < 0.01), respectively compared with the first BUN quartile. Conversely, by multivariable Cox analysis, the HRs (95% CIs) for poor outcomes in the second, third, and fourth cSosm quartiles, compared with the first cSosm quartile, were 1.13 (0.69–1.87), 0.95 (0.58–1.55), and 1.26 (0.78–2.03), respectively (P for trend = 0.39). In addition, with regard to the renal outcome of ESRD alone, higher BUN quartiles had a significantly increased risk for the outcome, but cSosm levels were not associated with the outcome.

Conclusions

Higher BUN levels, but not cSosm levels, were associated with adverse renal outcomes independent of the eGFR, suggesting that BUN may be a useful marker for predicting kidney disease progression.

### Blood urea nitrogen is independently associated with renal outcomes in Japanese patients with stage 3–5 chronic kidney disease: a prospective observational study [^111Tv6kn]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Urea at concentrations relevant to CKD has been reported to directly increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress in adipocytes, pancreatic β–cells, and aortic endothelial cells. D'Apolito et al. demonstrated that urea induced ROS production in adipocytes, leading to insulin resistance. Koppe et al. also reported that urea increased oxidative stress and protein O -linked N-glucosamine acylation in islets, resulting in insulin secretory defects. Recently, in a large cohort study, higher BUN levels were associated with an increased risk of diabetes mellitus; the HR (95% CI) for poor outcomes in patients with a BUN > 25 mg/dL was 1.23 (1.21–1.25) compared with a BUN ≤ 25 mg/dL. These findings could support the above experimental findings by D'Apolito et al. and Koppe et al. Alternatively, oxidative stress is progressively enhanced and correlates with the degree of kidney dysfunction in patients with CKD. Previous reports suggested that oxidative stress might be associated with the pathogenesis and progression of kidney disease. Urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine is considered a useful marker for predicting the development of diabetic nephropathy in diabetic patients. It was also suggested that malondialdehyde might play an important role in the pathogenesis of glomerulosclerosis and that advanced oxidation protein products were associated with the pathogenesis and progression of IgA nephropathy. However, it remains unknown whether urea-induced oxidative stress directly contributes to kidney disease progression.

### Urea and protein carbamylation in ESRD: surrogate markers or partners in crime? [^114y9Mh3]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Protein carbamylation may result from chronic exposure to elevated levels of urea in patients with chronic kidney disease. Carbamylation could cause conformational changes in proteins resulting in alterations in binding sites and disturbances in cellular functions. Elevated levels of carbamylated protein have been shown to be associated with increased risk of death from cardiac causes in patients with end-stage renal disease. The precise mechanism by which carbamylated proteins mediate toxicity in uremia needs further investigation.

Blood Urea Nitrogen BUN measurements are used in the diagnosis of certain renal and metabolic diseases. The determination of serum urea nitrogen is the most widely used test for the evaluation of kidney function. The test is frequently requested in conjunction with the serum creatinine test for the differential diagnosis of prerenal, renal, and post renal uremia. High BUN levels are associated with impaired renal function, increased protein catabolism, nephritis, intestinal obstruction, urinary obstruction, metallic poisoning, cardiac failure, peritonitis, dehydration, malignancy, pneumonia, surgical shock, Addison's disease, and uremia. Low BUN levels are associated with amyloidosis, acute liver disease, pregnancy, and nephrosis. Normal variations are observed according to a person's age and sex, the time of day, and their diet – particularly in their protein intake.

### Screening with blood urea nitrogen before intravenous contrast [^112LmUzo]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

In some settings, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) values are available well in advance of creatinine values. We wanted to determine whether BUN values can be used to screen for renal insufficiency for the purpose of intravenous contrast administration. From laboratory records, we derived and validated cutpoints for BUN values to detect creatinine values ≥ 2.0 mg/dL. "Sensitive" and "high-yield" cutpoints were derived using records from 5000 consecutive patients and validated using a random set of 2000 patients. BUN ≥ 15 mg/dL, the "sensitive" cutpoint, had sensitivity of 0.997 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.987–1.0) and specificity of 0.56 (95% CI, 0.54–0.59). BUN ≥ 20 mg/dL, the "high-yield cutpoint", had sensitivity of 0.98 (95% CI, 0.95–0.99) and specificity of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.69–0.73). Negative likelihood ratios for these cutpoints were 0.005 and 0.03, respectively. BUN values < 15–20 mg/dL provide strong evidence against renal insufficiency.

### Urea levels and cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic kidney disease [^112BCidJ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What is already known about this subject?

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is now considered as a major worldwide public health problem and the death rate due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) is significantly higher in patients with CKD than in the general population. However, conventional cardiovascular (CV) risk factors do not appear to fully account for this elevated risk of CVD.
For many years, urea was considered to be a relatively inert, nontoxic molecule. But several studies have shown that urea is a direct and indirect uraemic toxin. Although the mechanisms of urea's direct toxicity still require further investigation, in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that uraemia modulates the smooth muscle cell's phenotype, induces the expression of pro-apoptotic family genes. Other studies have shown that urea has an indirect toxic effect via protein carbamylation, which interferes with the proteins' molecular and cellular functions and is associated with CKD progression after adjustment for conventional risk factors. However, it is still not clear whether serum urea levels are related to CV outcomes in patients with moderate-to-advanced CKD.

What this study adds?

Among 2507 patients with CKD not receiving maintenance dialysis attending nephrology outpatient facilities, we showed that patients with moderately elevated serum urea were at high risk of developing adverse CV outcomes. The association was independent of CV risk factors including estimated glomerular filtration rate.

What impact this may have on practice or policy?

Considering the toxic effect of elevated serum urea levels in the management of patients with moderate to advanced chronic renal failure is important, given the actual body of evidence. Given the dietary origin of a proportion of the urea in the circulation, nutritional therapy could be used to counter an elevation in urea levels. Interventional studies of various diets and their impacts on CV outcomes (and especially non-atheromatous events) in non-dialysed patients with CKD are warranted.

### An isolated elevation in blood urea level is not' uraemia' and not an indication for renal replacement therapy in the ICU [^1177Q1zb]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Despite early meta-analysis suggesting early RRT improves survival in critical illness, more recent analysis does not support that view. The most comprehensive data regarding optimal timing for RRT initiation comes from a 2017 meta-analysis of RCTs assessing early versus late initiation of RRT in patients with AKI that concluded there was no added benefit of early initiation with respect to 30, 60, and 90-day mortality, overall ICU and hospital mortality, and dialysis dependence. Older studies have demonstrated increased mortality when serum urea reaches higher ranges (50.7–71.4 mmol/L), which perhaps established the tendency to initiate RRT therapy at lower levels.

Evaluation of the available data led to the proposal of serum urea > 35.7 mmol/L as an absolute indication for RRT but no recent RCTs have looked at urea as an independent variable for initiation. The only study found to consider serum urea in isolation confirmed a declining trend of threshold urea level for RRT initiation and no association with in-hospital mortality. Most recent studies did, however, implement an upper limit at which interventional RRT was initiated Table 1.

Table 1
Collation of recent studies with blood urea level criteria in exclusion or intervention

As no recent RCTs assess urea independently, it is reasonable to extrapolate the correlating urea levels to make a plausible appraisal of what level is acceptable to commence RRT. The recently examined upper limit was > 35.7 mmol/L to the onset of clinical signs or symptoms, although most studies initiated treatment no higher than 40 mmol/L. With evidence that no added benefit is derived from early therapy, in the absence of emergent indications a serum urea level of 40 mmol/L is therefore not unreasonable.

The practical implications are balancing the theoretical assumption that early initiation of RRT may lead to earlier removal of uraemic toxins, against the possibility that delayed treatment may result in spontaneous recovery and avoidance of RRT entirely. The KDIGO guidelines conclude that it is unclear whether the risks outweigh the benefits and that RRT should be initiated emergently when life threatening changes in fluid, electrolyte and acid–base balance exist. Furthermore, it recommends considering the broader clinical context, the presence of modifiable conditions and trends of laboratory tests rather than serum urea and creatinine thresholds alone.

### An isolated elevation in blood urea level is not' uraemia' and not an indication for renal replacement therapy in the ICU [^112ge7Vh]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Without definitive guidelines, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that initiation of RRT in a patient with a urea level less than 40 mmol/L in an otherwise stable clinical context is erroneously exposing them to risks of dialysis without any increased survival benefit. Furthermore, a reasonable argument can be made that even above 40 mmol/L, delaying RRT may be warranted in an otherwise clinically well patient with preserved kidney function.

Correlating clinical symptoms with blood urea levels in the ICU to aid the decision to commence RRT is complicated by many factors that have been identified as contributors to elevated urea levels such as dehydration, increased tubular urea reabsorption, heart failure, glucocorticoid use, gastrointestinal haemorrhage and exogenous protein sources (dietary intake, PEG feeds and colloids). At moderate serum urea levels (21.4 mmol/L) these factors do not appear to elicit ureamic symptoms in isolation from severely impaired kidney function.

Despite reliance on historical data and lack of recent quality evidence, it is plausible that, in the context of established kidney injury, the onset of ureamic symptoms is likely when the blood urea level is greater than 50 mmol/L. However, given the poor correlation with clinical symptoms, the multifactorial nature of AKI and variation in production and excretion, serum urea alone remains a poor indicator of ureamic toxicity, especially in the presence of additional urea-elevating factors, or the absence of other symptomatic or biochemical markers of severe kidney impairment.

### Blood urea nitrogen levels to verify estimated glomerular filtration rate, as derived from 2 commonly used equations [^115xgGfx]. Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

A blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (BCR) of 20 or greater indicates various physiological conditions. Whether glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimates obtained using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study equation and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) study equations are affected by a high BCR remains unknown.

Methods

Patients who underwent urine creatinine clearance (CrCl) and serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine assessments on the same day were enrolled in our study. Those with BCR of 20 or greater and less than 20 were categorized into high- and low-BCR groups. The concordance on diagnosing chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages by using urine CrCl level and serum GFR estimates was assessed.

Results

More disagreement in CKD stage diagnosis was observed in the high-BCR group (weighted κ = 0.600 and 0.541 for the MDRD and CKD-EPI study equations, respectively) than in the low-BCR group (weighted κ = 0.816 and 0.758, respectively).

Conclusions

A BCR of 20 or greater caused misestimation of the CKD stage. GFR estimates for patients with high BCR should be interpreted cautiously.

### Correlation between parameters at initiation of renal replacement therapy and outcome in patients with acute kidney injury [^117GVr8X]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Key messages

- The practice of RRT in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury remains variable with no agreed consensus on the optimal criteria for starting.

- In patients receiving renal support, failure of other organ systems, oligo-anuria and acidosis at time of initiation of RRT and pre-existing chronic illnesses were independent risk factors for ICU and hospital mortality.

- Failure to correct acidosis and development of more organ failure within 48 hours after initiation of RRT were associated with increased ICU mortality.

- The decision when to start RRT for acute kidney injury should be guided more by associated dysfunction of other organ systems, urine output and serum pH rather than absolute serum creatinine and/or urea levels.

### Timing of dialysis initiation in AKI in ICU: international survey [^112wtmyA]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Initiating dialysis in acute kidney injury (AKI) in an intensive care unit (ICU) remains a subjective clinical decision. We examined factors and practice patterns that influence early initiation of dialysis in ICU patients with acute kidney injury.

Methods

An online survey presented nephrologists (international) with three case scenarios with unstated predicted mortality rates of < 10%, 10–30% and > 30%. For each case the respondents were asked 4 questions about influences on the decision whether or not to initiate dialysis within 24 hours: Q1, likelihood of initiating dialysis; Q2, threshold of BUN levels (< 50, 50–75, 76–100, > 100 mg/dl) considered relevant to this decision; Q3, magnitude of creatinine elevation (two to three-fold increase; greater than threefold increase; absolute level > 5 mg/dl regardless of change) considered relevant; Q4, a rank order of the influence of five parameters (BUN level, change of creatinine from baseline, oxygen saturation, potassium level, and urine output), 1 being the most influential and 5 being the least influential.

Results

One hundred seventy-two nephrologists (73% in practice for > 5 years; 70% from the U.S. A.) responded to the survey. The proportion of subjects likely to initiate early dialysis increased (76% to 94%), as did the predicted mortality (p < 0.001). The proportion of subjects considering early dialysis at a BUN level ≤ 75 increased from 17% to 30 to 40% as the predicted mortality of the cases increased (p < 0.0001). The proportion of subjects choosing absolute creatinine level to be more influential than relative increment, went from 60% to 54% to 43% as predicted mortality increased (p < 0.0001). Rank-order analysis indicated that influence of oxygen saturation and potassium level on dialysis decision showed a significant change with severity of illness, but BUN level and creatinine elevation remained less influential, and did not change with severity.

Conclusions

Severely ill patients were more likely to be subjected to early dialysis initiation, but its utility is not clear. Rank-order analysis indicates dialysis initiation is still influenced by "imminent" indications rather than a "proactive" decision based on the severity of AKI or azotemia.

Conclusion

In Conclusion, our study found that among patients with CKD in the ICU, there was a significant association between BAR and 28-day mortality, with higher BAR levels significantly reducing the probability of survival. BAR may serve as a valuable and straightforward indicator for mortality risk stratification.

KDIGO AKI dialysis initiation and discontinuation — renal replacement therapy (RRT): Initiate RRT emergently when life-threatening changes in fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base balance exist (Not Graded). When making the decision to start RRT, consider the broader clinical context, conditions that can be modified with RRT, and trends of laboratory tests — rather than single blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine thresholds alone (Not Graded). Discontinue RRT when it is no longer required because intrinsic kidney function is adequate to meet patient needs or because RRT is no longer consistent with the goals of care (Not Graded).

### Dialysis cannot be dosed [^117KWaP8]. Seminars in Dialysis (2011). Low credibility.

Adequate dialysis is difficult to define because we have not identified the toxic solutes that contribute most to uremic illness. Dialysis prescriptions therefore cannot be adjusted to control the levels of these solutes. The current solution to this problem is to define an adequate dose of dialysis on the basis of fraction of urea removed from the body. This has provided a practical guide to treatment as the dialysis population has grown over the past 25 years. Indeed, a lower limit to Kt/V(urea) (or the related urea reduction ratio) is now established as a quality indicator by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid for chronic hemodialysis patients in the United States. For the present, this urea-based standard provides a useful tool to avoid grossly inadequate dialysis. Dialysis dosing, however, based on measurement of a single, relatively nontoxic solute can provide only a very limited guide toward improved treatment. Prescriptions which have similar effects on the index solute can have widely different effects on other solutes. The dose concept discourages attempts to increase the removal of such solutes independent of the index solute. The dose concept further assumes that important solutes are produced at a constant rate relative to body size, and discourages attempts to augment dialysis treatment by reducing solute production. Identification of toxic solutes would provide a more rational basis for the prescription of dialysis and ultimately for improved treatment of patients with renal failure.

### The correlation study between blood urea nitrogen to serum albumin ratio and prognosis of patients with sepsis during hospitalization [^1125nVeh]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Sepsis is a syndrome of various pathogenic microorganisms invading the human body and causing systemic inflammatory response. Early fluid resuscitation, infection control, and antibiotic therapy are the cornerstones of sepsis management aimed at correcting the condition of such patients. Although sepsis guidelines have been continuously improved in recent years, and a series of active "rescue" measures have been taken internationally for sepsis, its morbidity and mortality remain high. The mortality rate of sepsis patients hospitalized in ICU was as high as 41.9%. Therefore, how to find an accurate and reliable clinical index, which is convenient for judging the prognosis of sepsis patients during hospitalization, so as to improve the successful rate of treatment, is still a major challenge for clinicians.

BUN is one of the end products of human protein catabolism and is mainly excreted in the kidney. It is an important marker representing renal function, metabolic status and nutritional status. In critically ill patients, protein catabolism is hyperactive and BNU synthesis increases during stress response. In addition, increased renal urea reabsorption leads to elevated blood urea nitrogen level in dehydrated states. In recent years, studies have reported its potential predictive value in poor clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis. In a retrospective cohort study of 12,713 patients with sepsis, there was a non-linear relationship between BUN and 30-day mortality. Serum albumin, which is easily accessible as an indicator of nutritional status, contributes significantly to physiological homeostasis. Patients with sepsis commonly suffer from capillary leakage, reperfusion injury, tissue ischemia, and inflammatory responses, all of which can result in hypoalbuminemia. In patients with severe sepsis, lower albumin level has been linked with poor clinical outcomes and was an independent predictor of prognosis in patients with sepsis and septic shock, according to several studies. Our study showed that the non-survivors had a significantly higher BUN and lower albumin than those who survived during ICU hospitalization, which was in line with the other researches.

### Urea levels and cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic kidney disease [^116tBtQ4]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our analysis of a large prospective cohort of CKD patients not receiving maintenance dialysis attending nephrology outpatient facilities showed that higher serum urea levels were associated with a higher incidence of adverse CV outcomes and a higher all-cause mortality rate. Our findings are in line with the current body of epidemiological evidence on kidney function biomarkers and the risk of CVD, and suggest that urea should be taken into account when seeking to predict and prevent CV disease in patients with CKD.

Several serum biomarkers [such as serum creatinine or urea, or blood urea nitrogen (BUN), which reflects only the nitrogen content of urea], are routinely used in clinical settings to evaluate kidney function. Urea is the main metabolite derived from dietary proteins and tissue protein turnover. The compound is almost exclusively excreted by the kidneys in the urine, after filtration in the glomerulus and a certain degree of reabsorption from the filtrate. Although several nonrenal factors affect the serum urea concentration, reduced urinary elimination of urea (due to CKD) is the main factor that increases serum urea levels. Volume depletion by diuretics or a decrease in the effective circulating volume induced by heart failure might contribute to the elevation of urea levels in our CKD patients. However, the fact that bicarbonate levels were significantly lower in T3 than in T1 (Table 1) tends to rule out volume depletion by diuretics. In contrast, the difference between the tertiles in the prevalence of heart failure suggests that the elevated urea levels could be due (at least in part) to a decrease in the effective circulating volume caused by heart failure.
