## Question

How long before surgery should enoxaparin be held?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long enoxaparin should be held before surgery, and how that varies by dose, renal function, and whether neuraxial anesthesia is planned. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the context: prophylactic versus therapeutic dosing, renal function, and planned neuraxial procedures. Then, I should verify what major guidelines and the FDA label say about timing. Next, I will examine pharmacokinetic data and clinical studies showing residual anti-Xa activity beyond 24 hours. After that, I need to consider special scenarios like renal impairment and neuraxial anesthesia. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and confirm postoperative resumption timing.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts that change the answer. Enoxaparin is used either as prophylaxis (typically 40 mg once daily or 30 mg twice daily) or as therapeutic bridging (for example, 1 mg/kg twice daily or 1.5 mg/kg once daily), and the timing before surgery differs substantially between these uses. Renal function matters because enoxaparin is renally cleared, so accumulation can prolong anticoagulant effect. Finally, if neuraxial anesthesia or catheter manipulation is planned, neuraxial hematoma risk mandates more conservative timing, which is stricter than for general surgery alone [^115mW4Wf] [^115mW4Wf].

> I should confirm the guideline baseline for therapeutic-dose bridging. The ACCP 2022 guideline recommends that the last preoperative LMWH bridging dose be given approximately 24 hours before the procedure, typically as half the total daily dose on the morning of the day prior to surgery, to balance bleeding and thrombotic risk. Wait, let me verify the exact wording: yes, "approximately 24 hours" and "half the total daily dose" are the key points in ACCP and related summaries, and this approach is echoed in ASRA guidance for high thromboembolic risk patients on VKA bridging [^111vx8Ht] [^114UwJy8] [^115xyL1o].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions that 24 hours is always sufficient. I need to check pharmacokinetic and clinical data showing residual anti-Xa activity. A prospective 2024 study found that after treatment-dose enoxaparin, anti-Xa levels did not reliably fall below 0.2 IU/mL until a median of 31.5 hours, with the upper bound of the 95% CI at 31.5 hours, indicating that 24 hours may be insufficient in some patients. Earlier work also showed that giving the last therapeutic dose the evening before surgery left many patients with clinically meaningful anti-Xa levels at incision, reinforcing the concern that 24-hour holds can be inadequate for high-dose regimens [^116RtQ1i] [^116YjyX6].

> Let me consider prophylactic dosing, where the risk is lower but not negligible. The FDA label advises holding lower prophylactic doses for at least 12 hours before neuraxial procedures, but explicitly notes that anti-Xa activity may still be detectable and that these delays are not a guarantee against hematoma. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought 12 hours might suffice for all prophylactic cases, but the label's caution means I should individualize, especially if bleeding risk is high or neuraxial techniques are planned [^115mW4Wf] [^114Tb6C4].

> I will now examine renal impairment, because accumulation can meaningfully extend enoxaparin's effect. The FDA label recommends doubling neuraxial timing intervals when creatinine clearance is less than 30 mL/min: at least 24 hours after lower prophylactic doses and at least 48 hours after higher therapeutic doses. Let me double-check that I'm applying this correctly: yes, for CrCl < 30 mL/min, the hold should be extended beyond standard intervals, and this is particularly critical for neuraxial procedures where even low residual activity increases hematoma risk [^115mW4Wf] [^114Tb6C4].

> Next, I should review neuraxial anesthesia-specific guidance, since this is the most conservative scenario. ASRA and related guidance recommend at least 24 hours after a treatment-dose LMWH before neuraxial block or catheter manipulation, and at least 12 hours after prophylactic doses, with longer intervals for higher doses or renal dysfunction. But wait, given the 2024 data showing persistent activity beyond 24 hours, I need to ensure we communicate uncertainty and consider anti-Xa testing when available, especially if precise timing is crucial or patient-specific factors increase risk [^115xyL1o] [^116RtQ1i].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation. For therapeutic-dose enoxaparin bridging, hold the last dose approximately 24 hours before surgery per ACCP, but recognize that 24 hours may be insufficient in some patients; if bleeding risk is high, neuraxial anesthesia is planned, or renal function is impaired, extending to 36–48 hours is reasonable and supported by pharmacokinetic data. For prophylactic dosing, a minimum of 12 hours is acceptable in general, but I should confirm that 24 hours is safer when neuraxial techniques are anticipated or bleeding risk is elevated. In severe renal impairment, extend holds as above, and consider anti-Xa levels if rapid decision-making is needed and available [^111vx8Ht] [^116RtQ1i] [^115mW4Wf].

> I should confirm postoperative resumption timing because it interacts with preoperative holding. For low-to-moderate bleeding risk procedures, resume LMWH about 24 hours after surgery; for high bleeding risk procedures, wait 48–72 hours, and in high VTE risk patients, consider low-dose prophylaxis for the first 48–72 hours before transitioning to full-dose bridging. Let me verify consistency with ACCP: yes, this aligns with ACCP recommendations on postoperative LMWH timing and bridging strategy [^114mcHVo] [^114UwJy8].

> But wait, what if the patient is on prophylaxis for orthopedic or abdominal surgery rather than bridging? I need to ensure I don't conflate these scenarios. For routine prophylaxis without neuraxial plans, holding 12–24 hours is often acceptable, but for neuraxial anesthesia or high bleeding risk, 24 hours is prudent. The FDA labeling for prophylaxis in abdominal and orthopedic surgery provides dosing starts around the time of surgery, which is a different question than interruption of ongoing therapy; I should not extrapolate those start-timing instructions to interruption rules [^116aaBQr] [^116XQwR5].

> Final check and bottom line: standard teaching of holding therapeutic-dose enoxaparin 24 hours before surgery is guideline-concordant but may be insufficient in some patients, particularly with higher doses, obesity, or renal impairment. Extending to 36–48 hours is reasonable when bleeding or neuraxial risks are high, and anti-Xa testing can help when timing is critical. For prophylactic doses, hold at least 12 hours, extend to 24 hours if neuraxial anesthesia is planned or bleeding risk is high, and in CrCl < 30 mL/min, double the neuraxial interval as per label. I should document the rationale and coordinate with anesthesia and surgery teams to balance thrombosis and bleeding risks [^111vx8Ht] [^116RtQ1i] [^115mW4Wf].

Hold enoxaparin for **at least 24 hours** [^111vx8Ht] before elective surgery to minimize bleeding risk [^114UwJy8], with **36–48 hours** preferred for high-bleeding-risk or neuraxial procedures [^116RtQ1i]. For prophylactic doses, hold **12–24 hours** based on bleeding risk and procedural factors. Always consider renal function, body weight, and concomitant antithrombotics, and use anti-Xa levels if available to guide timing in high-risk patients [^1173jnfs].

---

## General principles for enoxaparin interruption

Enoxaparin has a **half-life of 3–5 hours** [^113LAAPz] and peak anti-Xa activity 3–4 hours after injection; however, residual anticoagulant effect can persist beyond 24 hours, especially with therapeutic dosing or renal impairment [^116RtQ1i] [^115mW4Wf]. Timing of interruption balances bleeding risk against thromboembolic risk, individualized to patient and procedural factors [^1118PP1p].

---

## Recommended timing for enoxaparin interruption

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended interruption** |
|-|-|
| Elective surgery (standard bleeding risk) | Hold last dose ≥ 24 hours before procedure [^111vx8Ht] [^11358fRS] |
| High bleeding risk surgery or neuraxial anesthesia | Hold 36–48 hours before procedure [^notfound] |
| Prophylactic dose (40 mg once daily) | Hold 12–24 hours before procedure |
| Renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min) | Extend hold to 36–48 hours due to prolonged elimination [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting current recommendations

Recent data show that **24 hours may be insufficient** for some patients, with residual anti-Xa activity > 0.2 IU/mL in 31.5 hours on average, supporting longer holds in high-risk settings [^116RtQ1i]. Similarly, neuraxial anesthesia guidelines advise at least 24 hours after therapeutic doses and 12 hours after prophylactic doses, acknowledging persistent activity and recommending longer intervals when feasible [^115mW4Wf] [^111Vtyhx].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing interruption timing

Several factors **warrant longer interruption**:

- **Renal impairment**: Reduced clearance prolongs anticoagulant effect; extend to 36–48 hours [^notfound].
- **Obesity**: Higher doses and altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate longer holds.
- **Concomitant antithrombotics**: NSAIDs, antiplatelets, or other anticoagulants increase bleeding risk and may require longer interruption.
- **High thromboembolic risk**: Consider bridging with unfractionated heparin if prolonged interruption is needed [^112vn2YQ].

---

## Role of anti-Xa level monitoring

Routine anti-Xa monitoring is not required, but measuring levels can guide timing in high-risk patients or when rapid reversal is needed. A level **< 0.2 IU/mL** is generally considered safe before neuraxial or high-bleeding-risk procedures [^notfound].

---

## Postoperative resumption of enoxaparin

Enoxaparin is typically resumed **12–24 hours postoperatively** once adequate hemostasis is confirmed, with longer delays (48–72 hours) after high-bleeding-risk procedures or neuraxial anesthesia [^114mcHVo] [^116aaBQr].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Standard elective surgery**: Hold enoxaparin ≥ 24 hours preoperatively [^111vx8Ht] [^11358fRS].
- **High bleeding risk or neuraxial anesthesia**: Hold 36–48 hours preoperatively [^notfound].
- **Prophylactic dosing**: Hold 12–24 hours preoperatively.
- **Renal impairment**: Extend hold to 36–48 hours [^notfound].
- **Postoperative resumption**: Resume 12–24 hours after surgery, delaying 48–72 hours for high-bleeding-risk procedures [^114mcHVo].

---

Enoxaparin should generally be held for **at least 24 hours** before elective surgery, with **36–48 hours** for high-bleeding-risk or neuraxial procedures; individualize based on renal function, dosing, and concomitant medications, and use anti-Xa levels when available [^116RtQ1i] [^115mW4Wf].

Epidural analgesia

Should trauma patients with epidural catheters receive pharmacological prophylaxis and, if so, which agent and at what dose?

Recommendation

Trauma patients with epidural catheters should receive enoxaparin at similar doses to those patients without catheters. In the presence of renal failure, UFH three times daily should be provided.

Discussion

Enoxaparin dosing is often interrupted after epidural catheter placement, leading to an increased VTE rate. Regional anesthesia guidelines recommend a 12-hour interval between enoxaparin administration and placement or removal of an epidural catheter (24 hours if higher than standard dosing is used), and delaying resumption of the drug by 4–12 hours. Efforts to minimize the time without pharmacological protection should be undertaken by meticulously coordinating epidural procedures with drug doses, such that no more than two doses of enoxaparin will be missed. For UFH, the interval between epidural placement or removal and drug administration may be reduced to 4–6 hours, with only a 1-hour gap before resumption. As a result no UFH doses need be held.

Periprocedural warfarin management and bridging — For patients at high thromboembolic risk (defined as a risk of arterial thrombosis of > 10% per year or venous thromboembolism [VTE] risk exceeding 10% per month), bridging therapy may be used, whereas the ACCP guidelines recommend against heparin bridging for patients at low-to-moderate thromboembolic risk. Warfarin is discontinued 5 days prior to the surgical date, and in high-risk patients low molecular weight heparin (LMWH; enoxaparin 1 mg/kg two times per day) is initiated once the PT INR has fallen below the lower end of the target range, ensuring creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 30 mL/min and platelet counts (≥ 100×10⁹/L); the last dose of LMWH is given in the morning on the day preceding the procedure. For VTE indications, bridging LMWH can be considered if the thrombotic event occurred within 3 months, if there is active cancer, or if documented severe thrombophilia is present; otherwise, warfarin can be stopped 5 days prior and restarted after the procedure, with appropriate DVT prophylaxis warranted during the periprocedural interval prior to therapeutic warfarin resumption.

### Optimal dosing of prophylactic enoxaparin after surgical procedures: results of the double-blind, randomized, controlled FIxed or variable enoxaparin (FIVE) trial [^113LEw65]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The accepted "one-size-fits-all" dose strategy for prophylactic enoxaparin may not optimize the medication's risks and benefits after surgical procedures. The authors hypothesized that weight-based administration might improve the pharmacokinetics of prophylactic enoxaparin when compared to fixed-dose administration.

Methods

The FIxed or Variable Enoxaparin (FIVE) trial was a randomized, double-blind trial that compared the pharmacokinetic and clinical outcomes of patients assigned randomly to postoperative venous thromboembolism prophylaxis using enoxaparin 40 mg twice daily or enoxaparin 0.5 mg/kg twice daily. Patients were randomized after surgery and received the first enoxaparin dose at 8 hours after surgery. Primary hypotheses were (1) weight-based administration is noninferior to a fixed dose for avoiding underanticoagulation (anti-factor Xa < 0.2 IU/ml) and (2) weight-based administration is superior to fixed-dose administration for avoiding overanticoagulation (anti-factor Xa > 0.4 IU/ml). Secondary endpoints were 90-day venous thromboembolism and bleeding.

Results

In total, 295 patients were randomized, with 151 assigned to fixed-dose and 144 to weight-based administration of enoxaparin. For avoidance of under anticoagulation, weight-based administration had a greater effectiveness (79.9 percent versus 76.6 percent); the 3.3 percent (95 percent CI, -7.5 to 12.5 percent) greater effectiveness achieved statistically significant noninferiority relative to the a priori specified -12 percent noninferiority margin (p = 0.004). For avoidance of overanticoagulation, weight-based enoxaparin administration was superior to fixed-dose administration (90.6 percent versus 82.2 percent); the 8.4 percent (95 percent CI, 0.1 to 16.6 percent) greater effectiveness showed significant safety superiority (p = 0.046). Ninety-day venous thromboembolism and major bleeding were not different between fixed-dose and weight-based cohorts (0.66 percent versus 0.69 percent, p = 0.98; 3.3 percent versus 4.2 percent, p = 0.72, respectively).

Conclusion

Weight-based administration showed superior pharmacokinetics for avoidance of underanticoagulation and overanticoagulation in postoperative patients receiving prophylactic enoxaparin.

Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) perioperative management and bridging — For patients on a VKA, warfarin can be resumed on the evening of procedure (D0) for most patients, or the day after procedure (i.e. D1) at the patient's usual maintenance dose. For high thrombotic risk populations, bridging is suggested with full-dose, subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), for example enoxaparin, 1 mg/kg bid or 1.5 mg/kg daily, or dalteparin, 100 IU/kg bid or 200 IU/kg daily, with the last dose given the AM of the day prior to the procedure (i.e. D–1) at half the total daily dose. Low-dose LMWH (e.g., enoxaparin, 40 mg daily or dalteparin 5,000 IU daily) can be used for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis for first 24–72 hours post-procedure, with full dose LMWH resumed 2–3 days post-procedure.

### Duration of prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism with enoxaparin after surgery for cancer [^115ABr1B]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2002). Excellent credibility.

Background

Abdominal surgery for cancer carries a high risk of venous thromboembolism, but the optimal duration of postoperative thromboprophylaxis is unknown.

Methods

We conducted a double-blind, multicenter trial in which patients undergoing planned curative open surgery for abdominal or pelvic cancer received enoxaparin (40 mg subcutaneously) daily for 6 to 10 days and were then randomly assigned to receive either enoxaparin or placebo for another 21 days. Bilateral venography was performed between days 25 and 31, or sooner if symptoms of venous thromboembolism occurred. The primary end point with respect to efficacy was the incidence of venous thromboembolism between days 25 and 31. The primary safety end point was bleeding during the three-week period after randomization. The patients were followed for three months.

Results

The intention-to-treat analysis of efficacy included 332 patients. The rates of venous thromboembolism at the end of the double-blind phase were 12.0 percent in the placebo group and 4.8 percent in the enoxaparin group (P = 0.02). This difference persisted at three months (13.8 percent vs. 5.5 percent, P = 0.01). Three patients in the enoxaparin group and six in the placebo group died within three months after surgery. There were no significant differences in the rates of bleeding or other complications during the double-blind or follow-up periods.

Conclusions

Enoxaparin prophylaxis for four weeks after surgery for abdominal or pelvic cancer is safe and significantly reduces the incidence of venographically demonstrated thrombosis, as compared with enoxaparin prophylaxis for one week.

### Patients requiring interruption of long-term oral anticoagulant therapy: the use of fixed sub-therapeutic doses of low-molecular-weight heparin [^116ARy2i]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

We tested the efficacy and safety of fixed doses of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in patients requiring interruption of vitamin-K antagonist (VKA) because of invasive procedures.

Methodology

Preoperatively, patients discontinued VKA for 5 ± 1 days; in those at low risk for thrombosis, LMWH was given at a prophylactic dosage of 3800 UI (nadroparin) or 4000 UI (enoxaparin) anti-factor (F) Xa once daily the night before the procedure. In patients at high risk for thrombosis, LMWH was started early after VKA cessation and given at fixed sub-therapeutic doses (3800 or 4000 UI anti-FXa twice daily) until surgery. Postoperatively, LMWH was reinitiated 12 h after procedure while VKA was reinitiated the day after. Heparin was continued until a therapeutic INR value was reached. The primary efficacy endpoints were the incidence of thromboembolism and major bleeding from VKA suspension (because of surgery) up to 30 ± 2 days postprocedure.

Results

A total of 328 patients (55.4% at low risk and 44.6% at high risk for thrombosis) were enrolled; 103 (31.4%) underwent major surgery and 225 (68.6%) non-major invasive procedures. Overall, thromboembolic events occurred in six patients (1.8%, 95% confidence interval 0.4–3.2), five belonging to the high-risk group and one belonging to the low-risk group. Overall, major bleeding occurred in seven patients (2.1%, 95 confidence interval 0.6–3.6), six patients belonged to the high-risk group and one belonged to the low-risk group; most of the events occurred in the high-risk group during major surgery.

Conclusion

LMWH given at fixed sub-therapeutic doses appears to be a feasible and safe approach for bridging therapy in chronic anticoagulated patients.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: a practical guide to common clinical challenges [^111GY8D9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Procedural Management

Past guidelines on perioperative and postoperative management for patients on DOACs have been primarily based on surgical risk (both thrombotic and bleeding), the DOAC's pharmacokinetic profile, concurrent medications, and patient characteristics (ie, comorbid diseases, history of bleeding complications, renal function, and age). 92, 93 Because of DOACs' fast onset and offset, periprocedural bridging is generally not required; however, it is important to note the length of time to hold regimens before and after procedures. Providers may find it useful to obtain specific coagulation measurements before procedures, especially in high‐risk interventions, to determine the level of hemostasis. However, for the majority of patients undergoing elective procedures, the interruption of DOAC therapy can be substantiated on a time‐based approach that takes into consideration bleeding risk of the procedure and renal function (see Table 8). 38, 93 Furthermore, the results of the ongoing PAUSE (Perioperative Anticoagulant Use for Surgery Evaluation; NCT02228798) will help to further define a more conclusive standard‐of‐care approach for perioperative management. 94

### Management of anticoagulation / antiplatelet medication and venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in elective spine surgery: concise clinical recommendations based on a modified Delphi process [^115tXJXk]. Spine (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Delphi method.

Objective

To gain consensus on the following questions: (1) When should anticoagulation/antiplatelet (AC/AP) medication be stopped before elective spine surgery?; (2) When should AC/AP medication be restarted after elective spine surgery?; (3) When, how, and in whom should venous thromboembolism (VTE) chemoprophylaxis be started after elective spinal surgery?

Summary Of Background Data

VTE can lead to significant morbidity after adult spine surgery, yet postoperative VTE prophylaxis practices vary considerably. The management of preoperative AC/AP medication is similarly heterogeneous.

Materials and Methods

Delphi method of consensus development consisting of three rounds (January 26, 2021, to June 21, 2021).

Results

Twenty-one spine surgeons were invited, and 20 surgeons completed all rounds of questioning. Consensus (> 70% agreement) was achieved in 26/27 items. Group consensus stated that preoperative Direct Oral Anticoagulants should be stopped two days before surgery, warfarin stopped five days before surgery, and all remaining AC/AP medication and aspirin should be stopped seven days before surgery. For restarting AC/AP medication postoperatively, consensus was achieved for low-risk/medium-risk/high-risk patients in 5/5 risk factors (VTE history/cardiac/ambulation status/anterior approach/operation). The low/medium/high thresholds were POD7/POD5/POD2, respectively. For VTE chemoprophylaxis, consensus was achieved for low-risk/medium-risk/high-risk patients in 12/13 risk factors (age/BMI/VTE history/cardiac/cancer/hormone therapy/operation/anterior approach/staged separate days/staged same days/operative time/transfusion). The one area that did not gain consensus was same-day staged surgery. The low-threshold/medium-threshold/high-threshold ranges were postoperative day 5 (POD5) or none/POD3–4/POD1–2, respectively. Additional VTE chemoprophylaxis considerations that gained consensus were POD1 defined as the morning after surgery regardless of operating finishing time, enoxaparin as the medication of choice, and standardized, rather than weight-based, dose given once per day.

Conclusions

In the first known Delphi study to address anticoagulation/antiplatelet recommendations for elective spine surgery (preoperatively and postoperatively); our Delphi consensus recommendations from 20 spine surgeons achieved consensus on 26/27 items. These results will potentially help standardize the management of preoperative AC/AP medication and VTE chemoprophylaxis after adult elective spine surgery.

Dabigatran etexilate — venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis after elective hip or knee arthroplasty is characterized by once-daily regimens of 150 mg/d or 220 mg/d beginning soon after surgery with a half-dose of 75 mg or 110 mg, compared against enoxaparin 40 mg/d started the evening before surgery or 30 mg bid started 12 to 24 h after surgery; across trials the primary effectiveness outcome was "total VTE", evaluable in 73% to 78% of patients, and the dabigatran regimens were "noninferior" to 40 mg/d enoxaparin in hip and knee arthroplasty but each was less effective than 30 mg bid after knee arthroplasty, with first dabigatran doses given 1 to 4 h postoperatively in the 40 mg/d comparisons and 12 to 24 h in the bid comparison; in a subsequent hip arthroplasty comparison, 220 mg/d dabigatran was again "noninferior" to 40 mg/d enoxaparin for "total VTE" and appeared more effective for "major VTE" (a composite of proximal DVT, nonfatal PE, and death related to VTE).

LY-517717 — pharmacology and arthroplasty phase 2 outcomes: LY-517717 shows oral bioavailability of 25% to 82%, inhibits factor Xa with a Ki of 5 to 7 nM, and has a half-life of about 25 h with once-daily dosing. In a phase 2 noninferiority trial, 511 hip or knee arthroplasty patients were randomized to six LY-517717 doses (25, 50, 75, 100, 125, or 150 mg started 6 to 8 h after wound closure) or to enoxaparin 40 mg once daily started the evening before surgery, with 6 to 10 total doses given. Randomization to the three lower LY-517717 doses was stopped early for lack of efficacy; the three higher doses had efficacy similar to enoxaparin (17.1% to 24.0%, 24.0%, and 22.2%, respectively). Adjudicated major bleeding events were uncommon, and further development of LY-517717 has been halted.

### Practice guidelines for perioperative blood management: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on perioperative blood management* [^112kV8ws]. Anesthesiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Discontinuation of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents — evidence and consensus indicate that one nonrandomized comparative observational study is equivocal regarding discontinuing warfarin and replacing it with low-molecular-weight heparin on transfusion requirements (Category B1-E evidence). Observational studies report blood loss volumes ranging from 265 to 756 mL and transfusion requirements ranging from a mean of 0.08 to 0.5 units when clopidogrel is discontinued preoperatively (Category B3 evidence). The literature is insufficient to evaluate discontinuing aspirin before surgery, with two RCTs versus placebo reporting equivocal findings (P > 0.01) for perioperative blood loss, transfusion, or postoperative adverse events (Category A2-E evidence). Survey findings state both consultants and ASA members strongly agree regarding discontinuing anticoagulation therapy for elective surgery in consultation with a specialist, if clinically possible discontinuing nonsurgical antiplatelet agents sufficiently in advance except in patients with prior percutaneous coronary interventions, and considering thrombosis versus increased bleeding risk when altering anticoagulation status.

### Rivaroxaban versus enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis after hip arthroplasty [^1171CC1i]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2008). Excellent credibility.

Background

This phase 3 trial compared the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban, an oral direct inhibitor of factor Xa, with those of enoxaparin for extended thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty.

Methods

In this randomized, double-blind study, we assigned 4541 patients to receive either 10 mg of oral rivaroxaban once daily, beginning after surgery, or 40 mg of enoxaparin subcutaneously once daily, beginning the evening before surgery, plus a placebo tablet or injection. The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of deep-vein thrombosis (either symptomatic or detected by bilateral venography if the patient was asymptomatic), nonfatal pulmonary embolism, or death from any cause at 36 days (range, 30 to 42). The main secondary efficacy outcome was major venous thromboembolism (proximal deep-vein thrombosis, nonfatal pulmonary embolism, or death from venous thromboembolism). The primary safety outcome was major bleeding.

Results

A total of 3153 patients were included in the superiority analysis (after 1388 exclusions), and 4433 were included in the safety analysis (after 108 exclusions). The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 18 of 1595 patients (1.1%) in the rivaroxaban group and in 58 of 1558 patients (3.7%) in the enoxaparin group (absolute risk reduction, 2.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5 to 3.7; P < 0.001). Major venous thromboembolism occurred in 4 of 1686 patients (0.2%) in the rivaroxaban group and in 33 of 1678 patients (2.0%) in the enoxaparin group (absolute risk reduction, 1.7%; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.5; P < 0.001). Major bleeding occurred in 6 of 2209 patients (0.3%) in the rivaroxaban group and in 2 of 2224 patients (0.1%) in the enoxaparin group (P = 0.18).

Conclusions

A once-daily, 10-mg oral dose of rivaroxaban was significantly more effective for extended thromboprophylaxis than a once-daily, 40-mg subcutaneous dose of enoxaparin in patients undergoing elective total hip arthroplasty. The two drugs had similar safety profiles. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00329628.)

### Updated guidelines to reduce venous thromboembolism in trauma patients: a Western Trauma Association critical decisions algorithm [^114obfnJ]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Burden of Disease

Venous thromboembolism, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is a potentially preventable complication after trauma. The focus of this algorithm is on optimizing the delivery of pharmacologic prophylaxis to prevent VTE and minimize any associated complications. For those trauma patients diagnosed with a DVT or PE, including distal upper extremity or calf thrombosis, specific treatments are addressed in other guidelines and will not be covered in this algorithm.

Without pharmacologic prophylaxis, a 1994 study determined that the DVT rate was 58% in severely injured trauma patients who undergo serial impedance plethysmography with lower extremity contrast venography. In a landmark, 1996 New England Journal of Medicine publication 30 mg of subcutaneous enoxaparin twice daily performed better than 5,000 U of subcutaneous heparin twice daily at reducing DVT in moderate to severely injured trauma patients (31% vs. 44%, p = 0.04). The risk of major bleeding was low regardless of therapy, and importantly, the first dose of pharmacologic prophylaxis was initiated within 36 hours of the injury and continued through all surgical procedures except spinal fixation when a single preoperative dose was held. This study established that early, uninterrupted enoxaparin was superior to heparin at reducing VTE after trauma. In the last decade, a number of reviews and societal recommendations focused on improving the guidelines to reduce the rate of VTE and related complications after trauma.–

Despite this progress, debate persists regarding optimal dosing and timing of enoxaparin, including when to initiate, hold, and resume it before and after surgery or epidural placement. Trauma patients frequently receive a delayed, suboptimal dose of enoxaparin, which is then held for any potential surgical procedure despite substantial evidence that encourages early, uninterrupted pharmacologic prophylaxis. An updated algorithm on the appropriate management of VTE prophylaxis is therefore indicated.

Regarding perioperative care for perioperative bleeding, more specifically with respect to management of antithrombotic therapy (heparins), ACCP 2022 guidelines recommend to consider administering half the total daily dose of LMWH the day before surgery/procedure in patients receiving LMWH bridging for an elective surgery/procedure.

### Perioperative management of vitamin K antagonists and direct oral anticoagulants: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115xsBwQ]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The management of patients who are receiving chronic oral anticoagulation therapy and require an elective surgery or an invasive procedure is a common clinical scenario.

Research Question

What is the best available evidence to support the development of American College of Chest Physicians guidelines on the perioperative management of patients who are receiving long-term vitamin K agonist (VKA) or direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) and require elective surgery or procedures?

Study Design and Methods

A literature search including multiple databases from database inception through July 16, 2020, was performed. Meta-analyses were conducted when appropriate.

Results

In patients receiving VKA (warfarin) undergoing elective noncardiac surgery, shorter (< 3 days) VKA interruption is associated with an increased risk of major bleeding. In patients who required VKA interruption, heparin bridging (mostly with low-molecular-weight heparin [LMWH]) was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of major bleed, representing a very low certainty of evidence (COE). Compared with DOAC interruption 1 to 4 days before surgery, continuing DOACs may be associated with higher risk of bleeding demonstrated in some, but not all studies. In patients who needed DOAC interruption, bridging with LMWH may be associated with a statistically significant increased risk of bleeding, representing a low COE.

Interpretation

The certainty in the evidence supporting the perioperative management of anticoagulants remains limited. No high-quality evidence exists to support the practice of heparin bridging during the interruption of VKA or DOAC therapy for an elective surgery or procedure, or for the practice of interrupting VKA therapy for minor procedures, including cardiac device implantation, or continuation of a DOAC vs short-term interruption of a DOAC in the perioperative period.

### Preoperative use of enoxaparin is not a risk factor for postoperative bleeding after coronary artery bypass surgery [^113WVGiN]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the use of low-molecular-weight heparin before coronary artery bypass surgery would be associated with an increase in bleeding and use of blood products after the operation.

Methods

Sixty-four patients (48 men and 16 women) aged 64 ± 10 years who were undergoing primary coronary artery bypass surgery were prospectively studied. Forty-one patients were treated with either subcutaneous enoxaparin 1 mg/kg twice daily (n = 21; enoxaparin group) or intravenous heparin (n = 20; heparin group). Patients received the last dose of enoxaparin 8.7 ± 0.75 hours (range, 8–10 hours) before skin incision. Heparin was stopped before transfer to the operating room. An additional 23 consecutive patients who received neither enoxaparin nor heparin served as controls (n = 23). Anti-factor Xa activity, a measure of enoxaparin and heparin activity, was measured at the start of the operation in all patients.

Results

There was no perioperative mortality. The length of stay and frequency of postoperative complications were similar between groups. Preoperative anti-factor Xa activity was present only in the enoxaparin group (0.43 ± 0.25 IU/mL). Chest tube drainage at 24 hours was 553 ± 160 mL, 532 ± 140 mL, and 587 ± 230 mL for the enoxaparin, heparin, and control groups, respectively (P = 0.48). There was no difference among groups in the amount of blood products transfused.

Conclusions

Enoxaparin administration more than 8 hours before coronary artery bypass surgery is not associated with increased postoperative bleeding or blood product transfusion.

### Outpatient management of anticoagulation therapy [^113f8nWk]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The Seventh American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy provides guidelines for outpatient management of anticoagulation therapy. The ACCP guidelines recommend short-term warfarin therapy, with the goal of maintaining an International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 2.5 ± 0.5, after major orthopedic surgery. Therapy for venous thromboembolism includes an INR of 2.5 ± 0.5, with the length of therapy determined by associated conditions. For patients with atrial fibrillation, the INR is maintained at 2.5 ± 0.5 indefinitely; for most patients with mechanical valves, the recommended INR is 3.0 ± 0.5 indefinitely. Use of outpatient low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is as safe and effective as inpatient unfractionated heparin for treatment of venous thromboembolism. The ACCP recommends starting warfarin with unfractionated heparin or LMWH for at least five days and continuing until a therapeutic INR is achieved. Because patients with venous thromboembolism and cancer who have been treated with LMWH have a survival advantage that extends beyond their venous thromboembolism treatment, the ACCP recommends beginning their therapy with three to six months of LMWH. When invasive procedures require the interruption of oral anticoagulation therapy, recommendations for bridge therapy are determined by balancing the risk of bleeding against the risk of thromboembolism. Patients at higher risk of thromboembolization should stop warfarin therapy four to five days before surgery and start LMWH or unfractionated heparin two to three days before surgery.

### Enoxaparin sodium [^112sBoab]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The beneficial effect of enoxaparin sodium on the primary endpoint observed during the first 30 days was maintained over a 12 month follow-up period (see Figure 2).

Figure 2: Kaplan-Meier Plot – Death or Myocardial Re-infarction at 30 Days – ITT Population

There is a trend in favor of enoxaparin sodium during the first 48 hours, but most of the treatment difference is attributed to a step increase in the event rate in the UFH group at 48 hours (seen in Figure 2), an effect that is more striking when comparing the event rates just prior to and just subsequent to actual times of discontinuation. These results provide evidence that UFH was effective and that it would be better if used longer than 48 hours. There is a similar increase in endpoint event rate when enoxaparin sodium was discontinued, suggesting that it too was discontinued too soon in this study.

The rates of major hemorrhages (defined as requiring 5 or more units of blood for transfusion, or 15% drop in hematocrit or clinically overt bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage) at 30 days were 2.1% in the enoxaparin sodium group and 1.4% in the unfractionated heparin group. The rates of intracranial hemorrhage at 30 days were 0.8% in the enoxaparin sodium group and 0.7% in the unfractionated heparin group. The 30-day rate of the composite endpoint of death, myocardial re-infarction or ICH (a measure of net clinical benefit) was significantly lower in the enoxaparin sodium group (10.1%) as compared to the heparin group (12.2%).

2.1 Pretreatment Evaluation

Evaluate all patients for a bleeding disorder before starting enoxaparin sodium injection treatment, unless treatment is urgently needed.

Abdominal Surgery

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium injection is 40 mg by subcutaneous injection once a day (with the initial dose given 2 hours prior to surgery) in patients undergoing abdominal surgery who are at risk for thromboembolic complications. The usual duration of administration is 7 to 10 days [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium injection is 30 mg every 12 hours administered by subcutaneous injection in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery. Administer the initial dose 12 to 24 hours after surgery, provided that hemostasis has been established. The usual duration of administration is 7 to 10 days [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

A dose of enoxaparin sodium injection of 40 mg once a day subcutaneously may be considered for hip replacement surgery for up to 3 weeks. Administer the initial dose 12 (± 3) hours prior to surgery.

Medical Patients During Acute Illness

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium injection is 40 mg once a day administered by subcutaneous injection for medical patients at risk for thromboembolic complications due to severely restricted mobility during acute illness. The usual duration of administration is 6 to 11 days [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis with or without Pulmonary Embolism

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium injection is 1 mg/kg every 12 hours administered subcutaneously in patients with acute deep vein thrombosis without pulmonary embolism, who can be treated at home in an outpatient setting.

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium injection is 1 mg/kg every 12 hours administered subcutaneously or 1.5 mg/kg once a day administered subcutaneously at the same time every day for inpatient (hospital) treatment of patients with acute deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism or patients with acute deep vein thrombosis without pulmonary embolism (who are not candidates for outpatient treatment).

In both outpatient and inpatient (hospital) treatments, initiate warfarin sodium therapy when appropriate (usually within 72 hours of enoxaparin sodium injection). Continue enoxaparin sodium injection for a minimum of 5 days and until a therapeutic oral anticoagulant effect has been achieved (International Normalization Ratio 2 to 3). The average duration of administration is 7 days [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].

### Perioperative management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients undergoing interventional techniques: 2024 updated guidelines from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^113ixG4y]. Pain Physician (2024). High credibility.

ASIPP 2024 — Warfarin and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) perioperative management for interventional procedures states warfarin is continued for minimal bleed risk, whereas for low to moderate and high bleed risk it is stopped for 5 days; other guidance recommends it be stopped for 3–5 days, and individualized care may achieve an appropriate INR below 1.5 after stopping for 2 days. Warfarin can be resumed on the evening of procedure (D0) or the day after procedure (D1) at the patient's usual maintenance dose. "Bridging suggested for high thrombotic risk populations with full-dose, subcutaneous LMWH (e.g., enoxaparin, 1 mg/kg bid or 1.5 mg/kg daily or dalteparin, 100 IU/kg bid or 200 IU/kg daily), with the last dose given the AM of the day prior to the procedure (i.e. D-1) at half the total daily dose". Low-dose LMWH (e.g., enoxaparin, 40 mg daily or dalteparin 5,000 IU daily) can be used for VTE prophylaxis for first 24–72 hours post-procedure, with full dose LMWH resumed 2–3 days post-procedure. Initiation of low molecular heparin therapy has been questioned and is no longer a recommendation as it increases the risk.

### Towards zero thromboembolic events after bariatric metabolic surgery [^1147e7BB]. Obesity Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Preoperative VTE Prophylaxis

Twelve hours prior to BMS, the patient received 40 mg of enoxaparin subcutaneously, and this was continued for 12 h postsurgery.

Oral Anticoagulant Presurgery

In case the patients had received oral anticoagulant before surgery, a rapid-acting short half-life anticoagulant (enoxaparin) was also administered to minimize the risk of bleeding. As the half-life of the anticoagulant effects of warfarin is 36–42 h, it would take at least 5 days for the anticoagulant effect of warfarin not to be active any longer after discontinuation.

Additionally, enoxaparin should be started 36–48 h after the last warfarin dose.

To complete bridging, a therapeutic dose of 60 or 80 mg twice daily was required, with the last dose administered 12 h before surgery. Prophylactic doses were used when the risk of discontinuation of an anticoagulant was low in the context of cardioembolic sequelae.

Regimen on Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs)

DOACs (e.g. apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban) possess a rapid onset of action of approximately 1–3 h to peak concentration and a shorter half-life than warfarin.

In line with the general prescription, the DOAC was stopped 48 h before the BMS. In patients at risk of atrial fibrillation, those with a history of DVT, and those with prosthetic heart valves, therapeutic cover with a dose of enoxaparin 40 mg was initiated. The last dose was administered 12 h before BMS.

Other drugs

Aspirin was not stopped before BMS, and clopidogrel was stopped 5 days before surgery and bridged with a prophylactic dose of enoxaparin.

### Warfarin cessation before cardiopulmonary bypass: lessons learned from a randomized controlled trial of oral vitamin K [^112dqwZU]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

No standard protocol of warfarin cessation and bridging for cardiac surgery exists. This study examined a single institution's protocol with respect to timing of cessation and low molecular weight heparin bridging. The recovery of vitamin K-dependent factors and the effects of cardiopulmonary bypass on coagulation factors were explored. Administration of preoperative oral vitamin K was investigated in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. A post hoc analysis examined residual anti-Xa activity of enoxaparin bridging.

Methods

Forty patients on warfarin undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass were randomized to receive 5 mg of oral vitamin K or placebo 6 days before surgery. Blood samples were acquired at six times and assayed for prothrombin time, anti-Xa activity, and functional levels of factors II, V, VII, and IX and of protein C. Measures of bleeding and transfusion were also collected.

Results

No difference in bleeding or transfusion was observed between the treatment groups. Appropriate recovery of coagulation factors was observed with warfarin cessation irrespective of treatment group. The coagulation factors decreased by an average of 0.36 units/mL during the period of surgery. Enoxaparin 1 mg/kg until the evening before surgery resulted in 70% of patients entering the operating room with therapeutic anti-Xa activity (0.6 ± 0.3 units/mL).

Conclusions

The cessation of warfarin 6 days preoperatively is sufficient for functional recovery of vitamin K-dependent factors, which undergo significant changes during the operative course. A 5-mg dose of vitamin K with warfarin discontinuation did not enhance recovery of vitamin K-dependent factors and is unnecessary. With the observation that enoxaparin up until the night before surgery resulted in high residual anti-Xa levels in the operating room, our center now administers the last dose of enoxaparin 24 hours before surgery.

### Apixaban versus enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis after hip replacement [^116Cgr7z]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

There are various regimens for thromboprophylaxis after hip replacement. Low-molecular-weight heparins such as enoxaparin predominantly inhibit factor Xa but also inhibit thrombin to some degree. Orally active, specific factor Xa inhibitors such as apixaban may provide effective thromboprophylaxis with a lower risk of bleeding and improved ease of use.

Methods

In this double-blind, double-dummy study, we randomly assigned 5407 patients undergoing total hip replacement to receive apixaban at a dose of 2.5 mg orally twice daily or enoxaparin at a dose of 40 mg subcutaneously every 24 hours. Apixaban therapy was initiated 12 to 24 hours after closure of the surgical wound; enoxaparin therapy was initiated 12 hours before surgery. Prophylaxis was continued for 35 days after surgery, followed by bilateral venographic studies. The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of asymptomatic or symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis, nonfatal pulmonary embolism, or death from any cause during the treatment period. Patients were followed for an additional 60 days after the last intended dose of study medication.

Results

A total of 1949 patients in the apixaban group (72.0%) and 1917 patients in the enoxaparin group (71.0%) could be evaluated for the primary efficacy analysis. The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 27 patients in the apixaban group (1.4%) and in 74 patients in the enoxaparin group (3.9%) (relative risk with apixaban, 0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.22 to 0.54; P < 0.001 for both noninferiority and superiority; absolute risk reduction, 2.5 percentage points; 95% CI, 1.5 to 3.5). The composite outcome of major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding occurred in 129 of 2673 patients assigned to apixaban (4.8%) and 134 of 2659 assigned to enoxaparin (5.0%) (absolute difference in risk, -0.2 percentage points; 95% CI, -1.4 to 1.0).

Conclusions

Among patients undergoing hip replacement, thromboprophylaxis with apixaban, as compared with enoxaparin, was associated with lower rates of venous thromboembolism, without increased bleeding. (Funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00423319.).

2.4 Discontinuation for Surgery and other Interventions

If anticoagulation must be discontinued to reduce the risk of bleeding with surgical or other procedures, XARELTO should be stopped at least 24 hours before the procedure to reduce the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In deciding whether a procedure should be delayed until 24 hours after the last dose of XARELTO, the increased risk of bleeding should be weighed against the urgency of intervention. XARELTO should be restarted after the surgical or other procedures as soon as adequate hemostasis has been established, noting that the time to onset of therapeutic effect is short [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. If oral medication cannot be taken during or after surgical intervention, consider administering a parenteral anticoagulant.

2.5 Missed Dose

Adults

For patients receiving 2.5 mg twice daily: if a dose is missed, the patient should take a single 2.5 mg XARELTO dose as recommended at the next scheduled time.
For patients receiving 15 mg twice daily: The patient should take XARELTO immediately to ensure intake of 30 mg XARELTO per day. Two 15 mg tablets may be taken at once.
For patients receiving 20 mg, 15 mg or 10 mg once daily: The patient should take the missed XARELTO dose immediately. The dose should not be doubled within the same day to make up for a missed dose.

Pediatric Patients

If XARELTO is taken once a day, the patient should take the missed dose as soon as possible once it is noticed, but only on the same day. If this is not possible, the patient should skip the dose and continue with the next dose as prescribed. The patient should not take two doses to make up for a missed dose.
If XARELTO is taken two times a day, the patient should take the missed morning dose as soon as possible once it is noticed. A missed morning dose may be taken together with the evening dose. A missed evening dose can only be taken in the same evening.
If XARELTO is taken three times a day, if a dose is missed, the patient should skip the missed dose and go back to the regular dosing schedule at the usual time without compensating for the missed dose.

On the following day, the patient should continue with their regular regimen.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) — perioperative management based on procedure bleed risk is outlined, including timing for resumption and optional post-procedure prophylaxis. DOAC can be resumed ~24 hours after low/moderate-bleed-risk procedures, and 48–72 hours after high-bleed-risk procedures; in selected patients at high risk for VTE, low-dose anticoagulants such as enoxaparin, 40 mg daily or dalteparin, 5,000 IU daily can be given for the first 48–72 hours post-procedure. This figure pertains to patients receiving a DOAC and provides guidance on whether to interrupt DOAC therapy perioperatively and how to interrupt based on surgical/procedural bleed risk in the pre- and postoperative period.

### Use of enoxaparin for anticoagulation therapy… [^113aCskR]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Patients maintained on warfarin may occasionally need to stop anticoagulant therapy during invasive procedures. Generally, this is accomplished by initiating therapy with unfractionated heparin once the International Normalized Ratio becomes subtherapeutic. Both forms of heparin require monitoring and adjustments to reach a therapeutic level. Exclusion criteria included obesity, renal insufficiency, unexplained bleeding in the past year, history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and positive heparin antibodies, recent neurosurgery and known pregnancy. Warfarin therapy was discontinued in all patients five to six days before the procedure, depending on the INR. Patients or caretakers received instruction about subcutaneous injections, and enoxaparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin, was started at a dosage of 1 mg per kg every 12 hours approximately 36 hours after warfarin therapy was discontinued.

Enoxaparin was withheld 12 to 18 hours before the procedure and restarted at the same dosage level and frequency after the procedure, once hemostasis was achieved. The patient's usual dosage of warfarin was restarted after the procedure, and enoxaparin was discontinued once the INR reached therapeutic levels. Patients received anticoagulation therapy on an outpatient basis unless hospitalization was required. Of the 20 participating patients, none developed bleeding or thrombotic complications during the procedure. Three patients developed postprocedure soft tissue bleeding complications. Fourteen patients reported little or no difficulty injecting themselves with enoxaparin twice daily. Sixteen patients stated a preference for home anticoagulation regulation rather than hospitalization for intravenous heparin therapy.

The authors conclude that enoxaparin, like other low-molecular-weight heparins, can be given subcutaneously and has a predictable anticoagulation effect that obviates the need for monitoring. The dosage of enoxaparin used in this study was high and may be most beneficial in patients undergoing a procedure that has relatively lower risk of bleeding. A lower dosage of enoxaparin may be appropriate in patients having more risky surgery. Further studies are needed to compare different regimens of enoxaparin in different settings and to evaluate the benefit of reduced hospitalization.

Heparin bridging — management points should be considered when administering heparin bridging, including that bridging is most often done with a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) using a therapeutic-dose regimen (eg, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg bid, dalteparin 100 IU/kg bid); bridging with therapeutic-dose IV unfractionated heparin (UFH) is another treatment option, for example, in patients with severe renal insufficiency or who are dialysis-dependent; and other types of heparin bridging may include intermediate-dose regimens (eg, enoxaparin 40 mg bid). Heparin bridging should be administered in a manner to minimize the risk for bleeding that would require re-operation or another intervention, and avoidance of major bleeding is important because it typically requires a longer period of anticoagulant interruption that, in turn, exposes patients to an increased risk for thromboembolism.

### Residual enoxaparin activity, anti-Xa levels, and concerns about the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine anticoagulation guidelines [^1173jnfs]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Currently, the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA) anticoagulation guidelines recommend that before the performance of a neuraxial procedure a minimum of 24 hours should elapse following a treatment dose of enoxaparin (1 mg/kg twice daily or 1.5 mg/kg once daily). The guidelines have since their inception also consistently recommended against the routine use of anti-Xa level monitoring for patients receiving enoxaparin. However, we noted in our clinical practice that anti-Xa levels were frequently still elevated despite patients meeting the time-based recommendation for treatment dose enoxaparin. To further investigate the possibility that residual anticoagulant activity may persist longer than 24 hours after a treatment dose of enoxaparin, we assessed anti-Xa level activity in patients presenting for elective surgery. Despite nearly universal compliance with ASRA's anticoagulation guidelines (1 sample was drawn at 23.25 hours), anti-Xa activity was found to be elevated in 11 of 19 patients. While 10 patients had an anti-Xa level within the peak prophylactic range (0.2–0.5 IU/mL), 1 patient's level was found to still be in the peak therapeutic range (0.5–1.0 IU/mL). These findings suggest that significant anticoagulant activity may persist longer than previously appreciated after the last treatment dose of enoxaparin and that the current time-based ASRA recommendation may not be conservative enough. Further research is needed to delineate the level of anti-Xa activity below which it is likely safe to proceed with a neuraxial procedure, but it may be time to reconsider the utility of anti-Xa level monitoring when it is available.

### Assessment of anti-factor Xa levels of patients undergoing colorectal surgery given once-daily enoxaparin prophylaxis: a clinical study examining enoxaparin pharmacokinetics [^111jDXQw]. JAMA Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Between 4% and 12% of patients undergoing colorectal surgery and receiving enoxaparin, 40 mg per day, have a postoperative venous thromboembolism (VTE) event. An improved understanding of why "breakthrough" VTE events occur despite guideline-compliant prophylaxis is an important patient safety question.

Objective

To determine the proportion of patients undergoing colorectal surgery who received adequate anticoagulation based on peak anti-factor Xa (aFXa) levels while receiving enoxaparin at 40 mg per day.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This prospective, nonrandomized clinical trial was conducted between February 2017 and July 2018 with 90-day follow-up at a quaternary academic medical center in the Intermountain West and included patients undergoing colorectal surgery who had surgery after receiving general anesthesia, were admitted for at least 3 days, and received enoxaparin, 40 mg once daily.

Interventions

All patients had aFXa levels measured after receiving enoxaparin 40 mg per day. Patients whose aFXa level was out of range entered the trial's interventional arm where real-time enoxaparin dose adjustment and repeated aFXa measurement were performed.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcome: in-range peak aFXa levels (goal range, 0.3–0.5 IU/mL) with enoxaparin, 40 mg per day. Secondary outcomes: (1) in-range trough aFXa levels (goal range, 0.1–0.2 IU/mL) and (2) the proportion of patients with in-range peak aFXa levels from enoxaparin, 40 mg once daily, vs the real-time enoxaparin dose adjustment protocol.

Results

Over 16 months, 116 patients undergoing colorectal surgery (65 women [56.0%]; 99 white individuals [85.3%], 13 Hispanic or Latino individuals [11.2%], and 4 Pacific Islander individuals [3.5%]; mean [range] age, 52.1 [18–85] years) were enrolled. Among 106 patients (91.4%) whose peak aFXa level was appropriately drawn, 72 (67.9%) received inadequate anticoagulation (aFXa < 0.3 IU/mL) with enoxaparin, 40 mg per day. Weight and peak aFXa levels were inversely correlated (r² = 0.38). Forty-seven patients (77%) had a trough aFXa level that was not detectable (ie, most patients had no detectable level of anticoagulation for at least 12 hours per day). Real-time enoxaparin dose adjustment was effective. Patients were significantly more likely to achieve an in-range peak aFXa with real-time dose adjustment as opposed to fixed dosing alone (85.4% vs 29.2%, P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

This study supports the finding that most patients undergoing colorectal surgery receive inadequate prophylaxis from enoxaparin, 40 mg once daily. These findings may explain the high rate of "breakthrough" VTE observed in many clinical trials.

### Generic enoxaparin questions and answers… [^114cy3qs]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

1. What is enoxaparin. Enoxaparin is available as an injectable medicine that helps prevent blood clots in the legs and other parts of the body. If these blood clots are not prevented, they can travel to the lungs and cause serious complications and even death. After a patient has surgery, such as hip or knee replacement or in some cases abdominal surgery, enoxaparin is often used for several days to up to a month to prevent blood clots. This medicine is also used to prevent blood clots in patients confined to bed and also for patients experiencing chest pain and heart attacks.
- Heparin, sometimes called "standard heparin, " is available as a liquid solution injected directly into the blood and only given to hospitalized patients, for instance, to prevent blood clots during surgery.

Because patients vary widely in their response to heparin sodium, laboratory monitoring of anticoagulant activity is needed to adjust the dose of heparin and monitor its effect in the hospital. In addition, heparin has potential to cause a possibly deadly condition known as Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia, where the body stops producing blood platelets. Thus, in the hospital, doctors can notice HIT right away and take action to reverse the condition. Doctors or other healthcare professionals must inject a patient with heparin. Patients cannot use heparin themselves. LMWH is also designed to last much longer in the body, so it does not need to be injected intravenously. Instead, LMWH is injected under the skin. Additionally, LWMH has a lower incidence of HIT. Because LMWH has more predictable efficacy and a lower incidence of adverse effects such as HIT, patients can inject LMWH themselves at home.

FDA scientists established a scientific approach for demonstrating active ingredient sameness that takes into consideration the complexity of enoxaparin. This scientific approach is reflected in five criteria, which involve the physical and chemical characteristics of enoxaparin, the nature of the heparin material and the chemical process used to break up heparin chains into smaller pieces, the nature and arrangement of components that constitute enoxaparin, certain laboratory measurements of the product's anticoagulant activity, and certain aspects of the drug's effect in humans.

### Updated guidelines to reduce venous thromboembolism in trauma patients: a Western Trauma Association critical decisions algorithm [^1132eiGK]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

G

Pharmacologic prophylaxis must be initiated as soon as possible and for most trauma patients may be initiated within 24 hours.

When high VTE risk trauma patients who receive enoxaparin within 24 hours of admission are compared with those who receive only mechanical prophylaxis, minor and major bleeding events do not differ. As detailed in section E, appropriate delays may occur in the initiation of pharmacologic prophylaxis because of active bleeding, coagulopathy, hemodynamic instability, solid organ injury, TBI, or spinal trauma. In most cases, pharmacologic prophylaxis may be started in less than 24 hours, and in almost every case, pharmacologic prophylaxis may be started in less than 72 hours.

Pharmacologic prophylaxis is often held because of pending surgery despite the evidence that it may be initiated before most surgical procedures.– Trauma patients who require an operation are unique in that their first operation may occur within minutes of arrival or days into the hospitalization. Increasingly, pharmacologic prophylaxis is delayed or skipped for pending surgery, which leads to an increased VTE rate. Preoperative dosing of pharmacologic prophylaxis is not unique to trauma. In other patient populations at high risk for VTE, the use of preoperative pharmacologic prophylaxis decreased the DVT rate without increasing the complication rate. Guidelines for perioperative care in gynecologic/oncology recommend, "Prophylaxis should be initiated pre-operatively and continued post-operatively". Patients who underwent elective hip surgery who received low molecular weight heparin approximately 6 hours before surgery had a lower rate of proximal DVT without increasing major, minor, or trivial bleeding rates. This benefit was not observed when low molecular weight heparin was provided 12 hours or more preoperatively. We believe that the common and somewhat reflexive process of withholding pharmacologic prophylaxis for 12 to 24 hours before planned surgical procedures is almost always unnecessary and will result in an increased VTE risk without an accompanying decrease in the risk of bleeding events.

### Perioperative management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients undergoing interventional techniques: 2024 updated guidelines from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^116sHofd]. Pain Physician (2024). High credibility.

Fig. 14. Perioperative management of interventional techniques in patients on direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) describes risk-based interruption and resumption schedules: For high-risk procedures, DOAC interruption is 2 days prior, the day of, and one day after the procedure for a total cessation of 4 days, except that if creatinine clearance is less than 50 mL per minute for dabigatran (Pradaxa) it is stopped for 4 days with resuming on day 2 for a total cessation of 6 days; for intermediate or moderate risk, pre-procedural cessation totals 2 days (the day before and the day of) with resumption the next day; and for low-risk procedures there is no need of cessation. Post-procedure, DOAC can be resumed ~24 hours after low/moderate-bleed-risk procedures and 48–72 hours after high-bleed-risk procedures, and in selected patients at high risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE), low-dose enoxaparin 40 mg daily or dalteparin 5,000 IU daily can be given for the first 48–72 hours.

### Efficacy and safety of bemiparin compared with enoxaparin in the prevention of venous thromboembolism after total knee arthroplasty: a randomized, double-blind clinical trial [^116iuvtK]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2003). Low credibility.

In this randomized, multicenter, controlled, double-blind, sequential trial, 381 patients undergoing primary total knee replacement were randomly assigned to receive subcutaneous injections of either 3500 IU anti-factor Xa of bemiparin sodium, first dose 6 h after surgery, or 40 mg of enoxaparin, first dose 12 h before surgery, followed by daily doses for 10 ± 2 days, for the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism. The primary efficacy endpoint was venous thromboembolism up to postoperative day 10 ± 2, defined as deep vein thrombosis detected by mandatory bilateral venography, documented symptomatic deep vein thrombosis and/or documented symptomatic pulmonary embolism. The primary safety endpoint was major bleeding. Eighty-seven percent of all randomized patients (333 of 381 patients) were evaluable for efficacy. The incidence of venous thromboembolism was 32.1% (53 of 165 patients) in the bemiparin group and 36.9% (62 of 168 patients) in the enoxaparin group. The absolute risk difference was 4.8% in favor of bemiparin [95% confidence interval (CI), -15.1% to 5.6%; non-inferiority P-value: 0.02; superiority P-value: 0.36]. The incidence of proximal deep vein thrombosis was 1.8% (three of 165 patients) in the bemiparin group and 4.2% (seven of 168 patients) in the enoxaparin group. Major bleeding occurred in six patients (three in each group). There were no deaths during the study. This trial shows that bemiparin started postoperatively is as effective and safe as enoxaparin started preoperatively in the prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing total knee replacement.

### Anticoagulation with enoxaparin versus intravenous unfractionated heparin in postoperative vascular surgery patients [^111rUs7Z]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The use of postoperative anticoagulation is not uncommon for patients undergoing vascular procedures, whether for adjunctive therapy to the surgical procedure or for resumption of preoperative anticoagulation. We investigated whether low-molecular-weight heparin, specifically enoxaparin, was an effective replacement for intravenous heparin during the postoperative period until achievement of a therapeutic international normalized ratio, together with the impact on postoperative length of stay.

Methods

We retrospectively examined 330 patients who received either traditional intravenous unfractionated heparin with adjusted-dose warfarin daily (n = 169) or subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin, specifically enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours, with adjusted-dose warfarin daily (n = 161). Safety was defined as incidence of bleeding, hematoma, stroke, expiration, thrombocytopenia, return to surgery for graft thrombosis or hematoma, and readmission within 30 days for hematoma or thrombosis.

Results

For all procedures, regardless of type of anticoagulation treatment, there was no difference in the incidence of postoperative complications, except for the increased incidence of return to surgery for graft thrombosis (P = 0.02), failing graft (P = 0.0004), and debridement (P = 0.01) in patients who received unfractionated heparin. For all procedures combined, the average postoperative length of stay was shortened by 2 days with use of low-molecular-weight heparin (P = 0.0001).

Conclusions

In this series, use of enoxaparin appears to be safe and effective for vascular postoperative anticoagulation. At the same time, its use can significantly reduce the average postoperative length of stay for patients undergoing vascular procedures. Further prospective data are needed before this protocol can be accepted as an alternative for postoperative anticoagulation in this set of patients.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^115T2MQf]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) interruption for elective surgery/procedure: The interruption can follow a pharmacokinetic-based approach whereby the pre-operative interruption interval corresponds to four to five elimination half-lives; given DOAC half-lives of 9 to 14 hours, withholding DOACs for 2 full days before surgery/procedure (a 60- to 68-hour interval from the last dose) should result in minimal to no residual anticoagulant effect for high-bleed-risk surgery/procedure, whereas for low-to-moderate-bleed-risk surgery/procedure withholding DOACs for 1 full day (a 30- to 36-hour interruption interval, approximately three DOAC half-lives) can be used, and in all patients no DOAC is taken on the day of the surgery/procedure; in dabigatran-treated patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance [CrCl] < 50 mL/min), interruption for 3 to 4 full days is required.

### Pharmacological interventions for preventing venous thromboembolism in people undergoing bariatric surgery [^1117MbxM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which comprises deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is the leading cause of preventable death in hospitalised people and the third most common cause of mortality in surgical patients. People undergoing bariatric surgery have the additional risk factor of being overweight. Although VTE prophylaxis in surgical patients is well established, the best way to prevent VTE in those undergoing bariatric surgery is less clear.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of pharmacological interventions (alone or in combination) on venous thromboembolism and other health outcomes in people undergoing bariatric surgery compared to the same pharmacological intervention administered at a different dose or frequency, the same pharmacological intervention or started at a different time point, another pharmacological intervention, no intervention or placebo.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 1 November 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in males and females of any age undergoing bariatric surgery comparing pharmacological interventions for VTE (alone or in combination) with the same pharmacological intervention administered at a different dose or frequency, the same pharmacological intervention started at a different time point, a different pharmacological intervention, no treatment or placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. VTE and 2. major bleeding. Our secondary outcomes were 1. all-cause mortality, 2. VTE-related mortality, 3. PE, 4. DVT, 5. adverse effects and 6. quality of life. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included seven RCTs with 1045 participants. Data for meta-analysis were available from all participants. Four RCTs (597 participants) compared higher-dose heparin to standard-dose heparin: one of these studies (139 participants) used unfractionated heparin (UFH) and the other three (458 participants) used low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). One study compared heparin versus pentasaccharide (198 participants), and one study compared starting heparin before versus after bariatric surgery (100 participants). One study (150 participants) compared combined mechanical and pharmacological (enoxaparin) prophylaxis versus mechanical prophylaxis alone. The duration of the interventions ranged from seven to 15 days, and follow-up ranged from 10 to 180 days. Higher-dose heparin versus standard-dose heparin Compared to standard-dose heparin, higher-dose heparin may result in little or no difference in the risk of VTE (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.99; 4 studies, 597 participants) or major bleeding (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.96; I² = 8%; 4 studies, 597 participants; low-certainty) in people undergoing bariatric surgery. The evidence on all-cause mortality, VTE-related mortality, PE, DVT and adverse events (thrombocytopenia) is uncertain (effect not estimable or very low-certainty evidence). Heparin versus pentasaccharide Heparin compared to a pentasaccharide after bariatric surgery may result in little or no difference in the risk of VTE (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.19 to 3.61; 1 study, 175 participants) or DVT (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.19 to 3.61; 1 study, 175 participants). The evidence on major bleeding, PE and mortality is uncertain (effect not estimable or very low-certainty evidence). Heparin started before versus after the surgical procedure Starting prophylaxis with heparin 12 hours before surgery versus after surgery may result in little or no difference in the risk of VTE (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.01; 1 study, 100 participants) or DVT (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.01; 1 study, 100 participants). The evidence on major bleeding, all-cause mortality and VTE-related mortality is uncertain (effect not estimable or very low-certainty evidence). We were unable to assess the effect of this intervention on PE or adverse effects, as the study did not measure these outcomes. Combined mechanical and pharmacological prophylaxis versus mechanical prophylaxis alone Combining mechanical and pharmacological prophylaxis (started 12 hours before surgery) may reduce VTE events in people undergoing bariatric surgery compared to mechanical prophylaxis alone (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.89; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 9; 1 study, 150 participants; low-certainty). We were unable to assess the effect of this intervention on major bleeding or morality (effect not estimable), or on PE or adverse events (not measured). No studies measured quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

Higher-dose heparin may make little or no difference to venous thromboembolism or major bleeding in people undergoing bariatric surgery when compared to standard-dose heparin. Heparin may make little or no difference to venous thromboembolism in people undergoing bariatric surgery when compared to pentasaccharide. There are inadequate data to draw conclusions about the effects of heparin compared to pentasaccharide on major bleeding. Starting prophylaxis with heparin 12 hours before bariatric surgery may make little or no difference to venous thromboembolism in people undergoing bariatric surgery when compared to starting heparin after bariatric surgery. There are inadequate data to draw conclusions about the effects of heparin started before versus after surgery on major bleeding. Combining mechanical and pharmacological prophylaxis (started 12 hours before surgery) may reduce VTE events in people undergoing bariatric surgery when compared to mechanical prophylaxis alone. No data are available relating to major bleeding. The certainty of the evidence is limited by small sample sizes, few or no events, and risk of bias concerns. Future trials must be sufficiently large to enable analysis of relevant clinical outcomes, and should standardise the time of treatment and follow-up. They should also address the effect of direct oral anticoagulants and antiplatelets, preferably grouping them according to the type of intervention.

### Enoxaparin sodium, isopropyl alcohol (enoxiluv kit) [^114Tb6C4]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Increased Risk of Hemorrhage

Cases of epidural or spinal hemorrhage and subsequent hematomas have been reported with the use of enoxaparin sodium injection and epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture procedures, resulting in long-term or permanent paralysis. The risk of these events is higher with the use of postoperative indwelling epidural catheters, with the concomitant use of additional drugs affecting hemostasis such as NSAIDs, with traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture, or in patients with a history of spinal surgery or spinal deformity [see Boxed Warning, Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Drug Interactions (7)].

To reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of enoxaparin sodium and epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of enoxaparin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when the anticoagulant effect of enoxaparin is low; however, the exact timing to reach a sufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known.

Placement or removal of a catheter should be delayed for at least 12 hours after administration of lower doses (30 mg once or twice daily or 40 mg once daily) of enoxaparin sodium injection, and at least 24 hours after the administration of higher doses (0.75 mg/kg twice daily, 1 mg/kg twice daily, or 1.5 mg/kg once daily) of enoxaparin sodium injection. Anti-Xa levels are still detectable at these time points, and these delays are not a guarantee that neuraxial hematoma will be avoided. Patients receiving the 0.75 mg/kg twice daily dose or the 1 mg/kg twice daily dose should not receive the second enoxaparin dose in the twice daily regimen to allow a longer delay before catheter placement or removal. Likewise, although a specific recommendation for timing of a subsequent enoxaparin sodium injection dose after catheter removal cannot be made, consider delaying this next dose for at least four hours, based on a benefit-risk assessment considering both the risk for thrombosis and the risk for bleeding in the context of the procedure and patient risk factors. For patients with creatinine clearance < 30mL/minute, additional considerations are necessary because elimination of enoxaparin is more prolonged; consider doubling the timing of removal of a catheter, at least 24 hours for the lower prescribed dose of enoxaparin sodium injection (30 mg once daily) and at least 48 hours for the higher dose (1 mg/kg/day) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### How I treat anticoagulated patients undergoing an elective procedure or surgery [^1118PP1p]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

The periprocedural management of patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulant therapy remains a common but difficult clinical problem, with a lack of high-quality evidence to inform best practices. It is a patient's thromboembolic risk that drives the need for an aggressive periprocedural strategy, including the use of heparin bridging therapy, to minimize time off anticoagulant therapy, while the procedural bleed risk determines how and when postprocedural anticoagulant therapy should be resumed. Warfarin should be continued in patients undergoing selected minor procedures, whereas in major procedures that necessitate warfarin interruption, heparin bridging therapy should be considered in patients at high thromboembolic risk and in a minority of patients at moderate risk. Periprocedural data with the novel oral anticoagulants, such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, are emerging, but their relatively short half-life, rapid onset of action, and predictable pharmacokinetics should simplify periprocedural use. This review aims to provide a practical, clinician-focused approach to periprocedural anticoagulant management.

### Efficacy of prothrombin complex concentrates for the emergency reversal of dabigatran-induced anticoagulation [^116nQJmC]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Pre-surgical management of the dabigatran-anticoagulated patient

Because dabigatran has a short half-life (in patients with normal renal function) and its effects on thrombin are reversible, the general recommendation for dabigatran-treated patients scheduled to receive elective surgery is to discontinue therapy temporarily and wait for the remaining drug to be eliminated naturally. The timing of discontinuation before elective surgery is based on a patient's renal function and risk of bleeding, and the type of surgery planned. In patients with normal renal function, dabigatran should be stopped at least 24 hours before surgery with a standard risk of bleeding; a 48-hour interim is appropriate if the risk of bleeding is high. These time periods increase to 2–3 days and 4 days, respectively, in patients with reduced renal function (creatinine clearance ≥ 30–50 ml/min).

2.1 Pretreatment Evaluation

Evaluate all patients for a bleeding disorder before starting enoxaparin sodium injection treatment, unless treatment is urgently needed.

Abdominal Surgery

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium injection is 40 mg by subcutaneous injection once a day (with the initial dose given 2 hours prior to surgery) in patients undergoing abdominal surgery who are at risk for thromboembolic complications. The usual duration of administration is 7 to 10 days [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium injection is 30 mg every 12 hours administered by subcutaneous injection in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery. Administer the initial dose 12 to 24 hours after surgery, provided that hemostasis has been established. The usual duration of administration is 7 to 10 days [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

A dose of enoxaparin sodium injection of 40 mg once a day subcutaneously may be considered for hip replacement surgery for up to 3 weeks. Administer the initial dose 12 (± 3) hours prior to surgery.

Medical Patients During Acute Illness

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium injection is 40 mg once a day administered by subcutaneous injection for medical patients at risk for thromboembolic complications due to severely restricted mobility during acute illness. The usual duration of administration is 6 to 11 days [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis With or Without Pulmonary Embolism

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium injection is 1 mg/kg every 12 hours administered subcutaneously in patients with acute deep vein thrombosis without pulmonary embolism, who can be treated at home in an outpatient setting.

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium injection is 1 mg/kg every 12 hours administered subcutaneously or 1.5 mg/kg once a day administered subcutaneously at the same time every day for inpatient (hospital) treatment of patients with acute deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism or patients with acute deep vein thrombosis without pulmonary embolism (who are not candidates for outpatient treatment).

In both outpatient and inpatient (hospital) treatments, initiate warfarin sodium therapy when appropriate (usually within 72 hours of enoxaparin sodium injection). Continue enoxaparin sodium injection for a minimum of 5 days and until a therapeutic oral anticoagulant effect has been achieved (International Normalization Ratio 2 to 3). The average duration of administration is 7 days [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^114nCUE4]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Role of low-dose LMWH as VTE prophylaxis in perioperative management — In patients who require perioperative interruption of a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) and are considered at high risk for post-operative venous thromboembolism (VTE), the need to administer low-dose low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) as VTE prophylaxis may be obviated once the VKA or DOAC is resumed. There may be circumstances when low-dose LMWH can be used in patients at high VTE risk; for example, those having abdominopelvic cancer surgery or hip or knee replacement surgery, and in such hospitalized patients, low-dose LMWH would be started, typically, 12 to 24 hours post-operatively and continued for 2 to 3 days while the VKA takes effect or until resumption of DOAC therapy. The administration of heparin bridging, particularly if only used pre-operatively, does not preclude the administration of post-operative low-dose LMWH (eg, enoxaparin 40 mg daily), including in patients at high risk for bleeding in whom post-operative therapeutic-dose LMWH bridging might be avoided. In patients who resume antiplatelet therapy after a surgery, the addition of low-dose LMWH can be justified in high VTE risk situations but is empiric and should consider the risk of bleeding.

### Effect of preoperative aspirin replacement with enoxaparin in patients undergoing primary isolated on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting [^114pm1aR]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Management of preoperative antiplatelet therapy in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is variable among surgeons: guidelines collide with prejudices because replacement of aspirin with low-molecular-weight heparin is still performed because of a presumed minor bleeding risk. This study aims to analyze postoperative bleedings and complications in patients scheduled for elective primary isolated on-pump CABG, depending on preoperative aspirin treatment or its replacement with enoxaparin. In this cohort study, we propensity score matched 200 patients in whom aspirin was stopped at least 5 days before CABG and replaced with enoxaparin and 200 patients who continued aspirin therapy until the day before surgery. Postoperative bleedings and complications were monitored during hospitalization. Among patients who continued aspirin treatment, mean overall bleeding was 701.0 ± 334.6 ml, whereas in the matched enoxaparin group, it was significantly greater (882.6 ± 64.6 ml, p value < 0.001); this was associated with reduced postoperative complications, lower values of postoperative C-reactive protein in aspirin takers, and a presumed protective effect for statins. After propensity score adjustment, aspirin treatment carried a protective effect against major postoperative bleeding (odds ratio 0.312, p = 0.001). In conclusion, postoperative bleeding is reduced in patients who continued aspirin, likely due to a reduction in postoperative inflammation. The practice of empirically discontinuing aspirin and replacing it with enoxaparin before CABG should be abandoned. Patients with coronary artery disease referred to CABG should continue antiplatelet medications until the surgical procedure. Those results might be extended to patients under oral anticoagulant therapy requiring CABG.

5.1	Increased Risk of Hemorrhage

Cases of epidural or spinal hemorrhage and subsequent hematomas have been reported with the use of Lovenox and epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture procedures, resulting in long-term or permanent paralysis. The risk of these events is higher with the use of postoperative indwelling epidural catheters, with the concomitant use of additional drugs affecting hemostasis such as NSAIDs, with traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture, or in patients with a history of spinal surgery or spinal deformity [see Boxed Warning, Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Drug Interactions (7)].

To reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of Lovenox and epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of Lovenox [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when the anticoagulant effect of Lovenox is low; however, the exact timing to reach a sufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known.

Placement or removal of a catheter should be delayed for at least 12 hours after administration of lower doses (30 mg once or twice daily or 40 mg once daily) of Lovenox and at least 24 hours after the administration of higher doses (0.75 mg/kg twice daily, 1 mg/kg twice daily, or 1.5 mg/kg once daily) of Lovenox. Anti-Xa levels are still detectable at these time points, and these delays are not a guarantee that neuraxial hematoma will be avoided. Patients receiving the 0.75 mg/kg twice-daily dose or the 1 mg/kg twice-daily dose should not receive the second Lovenox dose in the twice-daily regimen to allow a longer delay before catheter placement or removal. Likewise, although a specific recommendation for timing of a subsequent Lovenox dose after catheter removal cannot be made, consider delaying this next dose for at least four hours, based on a benefit-risk assessment considering both the risk for thrombosis and the risk for bleeding in the context of the procedure and patient risk factors. For patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/minute, additional considerations are necessary because elimination of Lovenox is more prolonged; consider doubling the timing of removal of a catheter, at least 24 hours for the lower prescribed dose of Lovenox (30 mg once daily) and at least 48 hours for the higher dose (1 mg/kg/day) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Evaluating residual anti-Xa levels following discontinuation of treatment-dose enoxaparin in patients presenting for elective surgery: a prospective observational trial [^116RtQ1i]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prior studies have demonstrated that patients presenting for elective surgery may have higher-than-expected residual anti-Xa level activity at or beyond 24 hours following their last treatment dose of enoxaparin. Given that 24 hours of abstinence is currently recommended by both European and American societies before the performance of neuraxial or deep anesthetic/analgesic procedures, determining the actual timeframe at which residual anti-Xa level activity reliably falls below 0.2IU/mL, the lower limit of the target range for thromboprophylaxis, is critical.

Methods

This was a prospective observational trial. Consenting patients on treatment-dose enoxaparin were randomized to either a 24-hour group (last dose at 07:00 the day prior to surgery) or a 36-hour group (last dose at 19:00 2days prior to surgery). On arrival for surgery, blood samples were obtained to assess residual anti-Xa level activity and renal function. The primary outcome was residual anti-Xa level activity following the last treatment dose of enoxaparin. Incorporating all patients, linear regression modeling was performed to predict the timepoint at which the level of anti-Xa activity reliably fell below 0.2IU/mL.

Results

103 patients were analyzed. Time from the last dose at which residual anti-Xa activity fell below 0.2IU/mL, based on the upper bound of the 95% CI, was 31.5hours. No correlation overall between age, renal function, or sex was found.

Conclusion

Residual levels of anti-Xa activity do not reliably fall below 0.2IU/mL 24 hours following discontinuation of treatment-dose enoxaparin. Therefore, current time-based guidelines are not conservative enough. Routine anti-Xa testing should be strongly considered, or current time-based guidelines should be reassessed.

### Guidelines for perioperative care for emergency laparotomy enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) society recommendations: part 1-preoperative: diagnosis, rapid assessment and optimization [^116zVe5i]. World Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulants and platelet function inhibitors

Long-term antiplatelet and anticoagulation use is increasingly common in many populations, and their management in emergency surgery is complex. Patients undergoing emergency laparotomy are at high risk of perioperative hemorrhage and thrombosis, given both the nature of their procedure and the underlying coagulopathy of sepsis and systemic inflammation. Hemorrhage following surgery is highly-associated with end-organ dysfunction and mortality in emergency general surgical patients. Reversal of these agents or their effects prior to emergent surgery, when possible, may reduce the risk of perioperative hemorrhage. Vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin are common, although newer direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are increasingly used. Guidance on reversal of specific antithrombotic medications and platelet function inhibitors has been published by various societies and is beyond the scope of this article. To guide management decisions, coagulation tests including international normalized ratio (INR), prothrombin time (PT), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) among others should be obtained preoperatively where appropriate, although conventional clotting studies do not help with low molecular weight heparin or DOACs. A variety of platelet function tests are available and should be considered for patients taking antiplatelet therapy. The decision to reverse antithrombotic medication should be based on the patient's immediate need for surgery, the risk of associated bleeding, and the risk of thromboembolism.

Anticoagulants (Warfarin, DOACs, Heparin/Enoxaparin)

Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) and fresh frozen plasma may be administered and titrated to the required effect in these cases. Specific reversal agents exist for DOAC medications and can be used if available. Dabigatran has a reversal agent idarucizumab and recombinant factor Xa functions to reverse apixaban and rivaroxaban.

Recommendation:
Strongly consider reversal of home anticoagulation medications when major surgical intervention is planned. This decision should be based on both the patient's risk of procedure-related bleeding and the risk of thromboembolism.

Level of evidence: Moderate.
Recommendation grade: Strong.

### What surgeons should know about non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants: a review [^112CpLiu]. JAMA Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are increasingly prescribed for patients to treat or prevent arterial or venous thromboembolism. The following 4 NOAC agents are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for clinical use: dabigatran etexilate, apixaban, edoxaban tosylate, and rivaroxaban. A good understanding of these agents' pharmacologic properties is important for surgeons given their marked differences compared with warfarin sodium. This review highlights key practical issues surrounding the use of NOACs in the perioperative setting.

Observations

The PubMed and Cochrane Library databases were searched for English-language studies from May 1, 2009, until May 1, 2017, for randomized clinical trials, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, observational studies, and clinical guidelines. From a systematic review of the published literature that included 70 articles and 166 404 patients, this study identified 5 key practical issues surrounding the use of NOACs in the perioperative setting. These include patient populations for which NOAC use is indicated and contraindicated, the timing of NOAC treatment cessation before invasive interventions, management of NOAC-treated patients requiring urgent interventions, the need for "bridging", and the timing of NOAC treatment's reinitiation after invasive interventions. Important findings are as follows: NOAC agents are not recommended for patients with mechanical heart valves or advanced kidney disease (creatinine clearance, < 15 mL/min); minimal to no anticoagulant effect remains when therapy with a NOAC is withheld for 48 to 72 hours before surgery in the context of normal kidney function; a reversal agent is clinically available for dabigatran, while reversal agents for apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban are under regulatory review; and laboratory testing of the anticoagulant effects of NOACs are not routinely available. There is a paucity of high-quality data on the optimal timing of NOAC cessation and resumption in the perioperative period, particularly for patients who undergo procedures with high bleeding risk.

Conclusions and Relevance

The anticoagulant effect of NOAC agents is predictable but not readily measurable in routine clinical practice. A number of uncertainties remain surrounding the use of these agents in the perioperative setting. Ongoing prospective studies and randomized clinical trials will provide greater clarity on these management issues in the near future.

### Surgical bleeding after pre-operative unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparin for coronary bypass surgery [^116L3uNK]. Haematologica (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Since the impairment of platelet function may cause excess peri-operative bleeding, pre-operative discontinuation of aspirin and heparin bridging are common for cardiac surgery. We evaluated the impact of pre-operative administration of enoxaparin and unfractionated heparin (UFH) on coagulation parameters and peri-operative bleeding in patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery after discontinuation of aspirin.

Design and Methods

Forty-three patients with three-vessel coronary artery disease undergoing elective CABG surgery discontinued aspirin and were randomized to receive either UFH 180 UI/Kg x 2/day s.c. or enoxaparin 100 UI/Kg x 2/day s.c. until 12 h before surgery (median pre-operative treatment 8 days, range 6–12 days). Surgery was performed as usual with UFH. Neither UFH nor any low molecular weight heparin was given in the immediate post-operative period. The effects of UFH and enoxaparin were monitored by the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and the Enox-test (sensitive to factor Xa inhibition) using a Rapidpoint Coagulation Analyzer. aPTT and factor Xa activity were also measured by standard methods. Peri-operative bleeding and the nadirs of hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit and platelet count were monitored post-operatively.

Results

Patients in the two groups were similar for number of bypasses, on-pump time, total surgery time, and time from the last heparin administration. Coagulation parameters increased significantly and similarly at 30 min and 6 h with both treatments, but returned within the normal range at 12 h. Hemoglobin, hematocrit and platelet counts significantly decreased to the same extent after CABG and re-normalized at the same time. Transfusional requirements of blood and plasma units were similar in the two groups.

Interpretation and Conclusions

From the kinetics of coagulation parameters and the evaluation of bleeding, enoxaparin is a safe alternative to UFH as a bridging therapy to CABG after discontinuation of aspirin.

### Perioperative factor Xa inhibitor discontinuation for patients undergoing procedures with minimal or low bleeding risk [^114fUYjd]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

A strength of the PERIXa study lies in its prospective enrollment of 1902 patients undergoing planned procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk, along with its inclusion of valuable edoxaban periprocedural data (n = 616 [32.4%]), which is limited in this research field. This study demonstrated a simplified DOAC interruption protocol before and after these interventions, making communicating with patients and health care professionals easier. This protocol resulted in a very low major bleeding event rate and no thromboembolic events at 30 days. A recent reviewproposes a slightly shorter, near noninterruption protocol than the PERIXa study. Their protocol suggests omitting twice daily DOACs only on the morning of the procedure and delaying once daily DOACs slightly beyond their usual ingestion time. However, this recommendation lacks support from evidence encompassing a wide range of large-scale procedures or 3 categories of procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk. Moreover, the absence of a defined discontinuation protocol can raise patient and health care professionals' concerns about postprocedure hemostasis difficulties, potentially leading to unnecessary and prolonged DOAC discontinuation.

2.1	Pretreatment Evaluation

Evaluate all patients for a bleeding disorder before starting Lovenox treatment, unless treatment is urgently needed.

Abdominal Surgery

The recommended dose of Lovenox is 40 mg by subcutaneous injection once a day (with the initial dose given 2 hours prior to surgery) in patients undergoing abdominal surgery who are at risk for thromboembolic complications. The usual duration of administration is 7 to 10 days [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery

The recommended dose of Lovenox is 30 mg every 12 hours administered by subcutaneous injection in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery. Administer the initial dose 12 to 24 hours after surgery, provided that hemostasis has been established. The usual duration of administration is 7 to 10 days [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

A dose of Lovenox of 40 mg once a day subcutaneously may be considered for hip replacement surgery for up to 3 weeks. Administer the initial dose 12 (± 3) hours prior to surgery.

Medical Patients during Acute Illness

The recommended dose of Lovenox is 40 mg once a day administered by subcutaneous injection for medical patients at risk for thromboembolic complications due to severely restricted mobility during acute illness. The usual duration of administration is 6 to 11 days [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis with or without Pulmonary Embolism

The recommended dose of Lovenox is 1 mg/kg every 12 hours administered subcutaneously in patients with acute deep vein thrombosis without pulmonary embolism, who can be treated at home in an outpatient setting.

The recommended dose of Lovenox is 1 mg/kg every 12 hours administered subcutaneously or 1.5 mg/kg once a day administered subcutaneously at the same time every day for inpatient (hospital) treatment of patients with acute deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism or patients with acute deep vein thrombosis without pulmonary embolism (who are not candidates for outpatient treatment).

In both outpatient and inpatient (hospital) treatments, initiate warfarin sodium therapy when appropriate (usually within 72 hours of Lovenox). Continue Lovenox for a minimum of 5 days and until a therapeutic oral anticoagulant effect has been achieved (International Normalization Ratio 2 to 3). The average duration of administration is 7 days [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].

Perioperative interruption and resumption of DOACs — pre-operative DOAC level testing and circumstances for longer interruption are outlined: Measurement of DOAC levels before the surgery/procedure may be considered in patients who require an urgent (ie, within 24 hours) surgery, because routine coagulation tests such as the INR or aPTT may be insensitive; testing options include DOAC-calibrated anti-factor Xa levels for apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, and dilute thrombin time or ecarin clotting time for dabigatran, though questions remain as to their clinical utility. There may be selected patients in whom a longer duration of pre-operative DOAC interruption may be required due to the longer time required for drug clearance as 75% to 80% of dabigatran clearance is by the kidney and in those with severely impaired renal function (CrCl < 30 mL/min) or hepatic dysfunction or taking drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 or P-glycoprotein pathways.

### Controversies in timing of the first dose of anticoagulant prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism after major orthopedic surgery [^113RkSCZ]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

Adjusted doses of oral warfarin sodium or fixed doses of subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) are the standard approaches for preventing venous thromboembolism following major orthopedic surgery of the legs. In recent years, new anticoagulants have been compared with either LMWH or warfarin. The optimal timing for the first dose of LMWH prophylaxis and of the new anticoagulants is controversial. Recent clinical trials of LMWH and of newer anticoagulants have provided new information on the relationship between the timing of the first anticoagulant dose and the efficacy and safety of thromboprophylaxis after major orthopedic surgery. These data on the optimal timing of initiating prophylaxis come from limited direct randomized comparisons of different timing with the same anticoagulant, subgroup analysis of large studies with a single anticoagulant, indirect comparisons across studies in systematic reviews, and single randomized trials comparing different anticoagulants. In the direct comparison of the same anticoagulant, preoperative initiation of the same regimen of LMWH (dalteparin) increased major bleeding, without improved antithrombotic efficacy compared to the early postoperative regimen. Fondaparinux, 2.5 mg, begun 6 h postoperatively is more effective and as safe as the currently approved regimens of enoxaparin begun either 12 h preoperatively, or 12 to 24 h postoperatively, in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery. In a subgroup analysis of several large randomized trials, fondaparinux, 2.5 mg, begun < 6 h postoperatively was associated with increased major bleeding, without improved efficacy. The results of indirect comparisons also favor the use of a 6-h postoperative starting time for the first dose, while the single randomized trials comparing different anticoagulants performed to date are not helpful in establishing an optimal time for the first dose. The aggregate clinical research evidence supports the following general conclusions about the relationship between the timing of the first anticoagulant dose and the efficacy and safety of prophylaxis: (1) preoperative initiation is not required for good efficacy and, when begun within 2 h of surgery, increases major bleeding; (2) initiation at 6 h postoperatively is effective and not associated with increased major bleeding; (3) initiation < 6 h postoperatively increases major bleeding, without improved efficacy; thus, 6 h appears to be the threshold for early postoperative administration; and (4) initiation 12 to 24 h postoperatively may be less effective than initiation at 6 h, but further randomized trials comparing the same anticoagulant initiated at different times postoperatively (eg, 6 h vs 12 h) are required to establish definitively the optimal timing of the first anticoagulant dose.

### Guidelines for perioperative care for liver surgery: enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) society recommendations 2022 [^11513QU7]. World Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Anti-thrombotic prophylaxis

Liver surgery is an independent risk factor for postoperative thromboembolic events, and this risk is directly proportional to the magnitude of hepatectomy. In addition, this risk extends beyond hospital discharge. Since the last published ERAS liver guidelines, one prospective study on the use of enoxaparin treatment in patients after curative HPB surgery for malignancies was published. In this prospective multicenter study including 74 hepatectomies and 35 pancreaticoduodenectomies, subcutaneous injection of enoxaparin was initiated 48–72 h after surgery and repeated for 8 days. Neither major bleeding (primary endpoint) nor symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) was observed. In a recent meta-analysis of 5 retrospective studies including 2256 patients who received chemical thromboprophylaxis, 1412 with mechanical prophylaxis only, the use of chemical thromboprophylaxis reduced the VTE incidence (2.6% vs. 4.6%) following liver surgery without any apparent risk of bleeding. However, chemical thromboprophylaxis dosing was varied and was initiated at different times of the perioperative pathway. The results of the updated Cochrane review (7 RCT, 1,728 participants) on the use of prolonged thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in abdominal and pelvic surgery favor the use of prolonged LMWH ≥ 14 days after surgery. The overall incidence of VTE was reduced from 13.2% in the control group (i.e. only hospital thromboprophylaxis) to 5.3% in the study group. This reduction was also observed when analyzing the rate of deep venous thrombosis and symptomatic VTE. There is no clear evidence to start chemical thromboprophylaxis the day before liver surgery, although this issue has never been addressed in liver surgery studies. There are no reports suggesting that omission of the preoperative dose places patients at higher risk for VTE after hepatectomy. Although no specific studies for liver surgery were found, the use of intermittent pneumatic compression devices applied prior to induction of anesthesia combined with chemical thromboprophylaxis is supported in the literature. A meta-analysis of 16,164 patients from 70 studies found almost a 50% risk reduction of VTE when combining intermittent pneumatic compression and chemical thromboprophylaxis compared to intermittent pneumatic compression alone (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32–0.91, p = 0.02).

### Enoxaparin sodium [^111w3oak]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis following Abdominal Surgery in Patients at Risk for Thromboembolic Complications

Abdominal surgery patients at risk include those who are over 40 years of age, obese, undergoing surgery under general anesthesia lasting longer than 30 minutes or who have additional risk factors such as malignancy or a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).

In a double-blind, parallel group study of patients undergoing elective cancer surgery of the gastrointestinal, urological, or gynecological tract, a total of 1116 patients were enrolled in the study, and 1115 patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 32 to 97 years (mean age 67 years) with 52.7% men and 47.3% women. Patients were 98% Caucasian, 1.1% Black, 0.4% Asian and 0.4% others. Enoxaparin sodium 40 mg subcutaneously, administered once a day, beginning 2 hours prior to surgery and continuing for a maximum of 12 days after surgery, was comparable to heparin 5,000 U every 8 hours subcutaneously in reducing the risk of DVT. The efficacy data are provided below (see Table 14).

In a second double-blind, parallel group study, enoxaparin sodium 40 mg subcutaneously once a day was compared to heparin 5,000 U every 8 hours subcutaneously in patients undergoing colorectal surgery (one-third with cancer). A total of 1347 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 18 to 92 years (mean age 50.1 years) with 54.2% men and 45.8% women. Treatment was initiated approximately 2 hours prior to surgery and continued for approximately 7 to 10 days after surgery. The efficacy data are provided below (see Table 15).

Darexaban — venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention after elective hip arthroplasty — was evaluated in 174 patients with once-daily doses of 3, 10, 30, or 60 mg, producing a statistically significant dose response for efficacy with no major bleeding events and no dose-response trend for clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. In a second phase 2 dose-finding study, 1,017 patients were randomized to darexaban 5, 10, 30, 60, or 120 mg once daily or to enoxaparin 40 mg once daily starting 12 h prior to surgery for 5 weeks; the primary efficacy end point, a composite of VTE or all-cause mortality, occurred in 18.9% of patients given enoxaparin, and darexaban showed dose-dependent VTE rates of 19.3%, 13.3%, and 14.5% in the 30-, 60-, and 90 mg groups, with one major bleeding event with 60 mg and one with enoxaparin; an initial Japanese filing for orthopedic VTE prevention was withdrawn because the regulatory agency requested additional clinical trials.

Management of anticoagulation in elective cases

Three factors that need to be considered in the case of elective surgeries are (1) when to stop, (2) whether to bridge, and (3) when to restart.

Discontinuation prior to surgery: General recommendations are summarized in the table (table 8) below and are according to the American College of Chest Physician 2012 Guidelines published in Chest, the RE-LY trial published in Circulation 2012, the ROCKET AF trial, and the manufacturer's recommendations.

Table 8
Recommendations for timing of discontinuation of anticoagulation for elective surgery

Patients whose procedures are at low risk of bleeding may continue oral anticoagulation therapy. This is particularly true for high-risk patients such as those with mechanical heart values.

Indications for bridging: The need for perioperative bridging is decided on by taking into account the patient's thromboembolism and hemorrhage risk and stratifying them into low, medium and high risk. In the case of warfarin, recommendations are summarized in the flow chart below (figure 3), adapted from the 2012 American College of Chest Physicians Guidelines. Bridging may be achieved either with intravenous unfractionated heparin or with subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin. Temporary interruption of vitamin K antagonism agents, without bridging while the INR is subtherapeutic, is recommended for patients with bileaflet mechanical aortic valve replacements and no other risk factors. All other mechanical valve settings should undergo bridging.

Efficacy of bridging: Whether or not outcomes are really better with bridging patients on vitamin K antagonists remains uncertain. A meta-analysis published by Siegal et al in 2012 found that the rate of thromboembolism was equivalent in patients who underwent periprocedural heparin bridging; however, there was a significantly higher number of patients who had major bleeding complications in those undergoing heparin bridging. These results were replicated in a randomized controlled trial by Douketis et al in 2015 demonstrating non-inferiority between patients undergoing no bridging versus those with low-molecular-weight heparin bridging and a significant reduction of major bleeding complications in those patients who did not undergo bridging.

Regarding perioperative care for periprocedural management of antithrombotic therapy, more specifically with respect to patients on heparins, ACCP 2022 guidelines recommend to consider administering the last preoperative LMWH bridging dose at approximately 24 hours before a surgery/procedure in patients receiving LMWH bridging for an elective surgery/procedure.

### Postoperative fondaparinux versus preoperative enoxaparin for prevention of venous thromboembolism in elective hip-replacement surgery: a randomised double-blind comparison [^111wZhnW]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

Background

Despite use of thromboprophylaxis, elective hip-replacement surgery carries a high risk of venous thromboembolic complications. We aimed to assess the ability of the pentasaccharide fondaparinux, the first of a new class of synthetic antithrombotic agents, to further reduce this risk.

Methods

In a double-blind study, we randomly assigned 2309 consecutive patients aged 18 years or older who were undergoing elective hip-replacement surgery to once daily, subcutaneous injections of either 2.5 mg fondaparinux, starting postoperatively, or 40 mg enoxaparin, starting preoperatively. The primary efficacy outcome was venous thromboembolism up to day 11, defined as deep-vein thrombosis detected by mandatory bilateral venography, documented symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis, or documented symptomatic pulmonary embolism. The main safety outcomes were bleeding and death. The duration of follow-up was 6 weeks. Analysis was per protocol.

Findings

We assessed the primary efficacy outcome in 1827 (79%) of 2309 patients. By day 11, venous thromboembolisms were recorded in 37 (4%) of 908 patients assigned to fondaparinux and in 85 (9%) of 919 assigned to enoxaparin (difference -5.2% [95% CI -8.1 to -2.7], p < 0.0001). The relative reduction in risk was 55.9% (95% CI 33.1–72.8). The two groups did not differ in frequency of death or clinically relevant bleeding.

Interpretation

Drugs that act through specific inhibition of factor Xa, such as fondaparinux, could be more effective than low molecular weight heparins in prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing hip-replacement surgery.

### Brief communication: preoperative anticoagulant activity after bridging low-molecular-weight heparin for temporary interruption of warfarin [^116YjyX6]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Preoperative low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is often used when warfarin therapy is interrupted for surgery.

Objective

To determine the preoperative anticoagulant activity of LMWH following a standardized "bridging" regimen.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

Single university hospital.

Patients

Consecutive patients who had warfarin therapy interrupted before an invasive procedure.

Intervention

Enoxaparin, 1 mg/kg of body weight, twice daily. The last dose was administered the evening before surgery.

Measurements

Blood anti-factor Xa heparin levels measured shortly before surgery.

Results

Preoperative anti-Xa heparin levels were obtained in 80 patients at an average of 14 hours after the last dose of enoxaparin was administered. The average anti-Xa heparin level was 0.6 U/mL. The anti-Xa heparin level, measured shortly before surgery, was 0.5 U/mL or greater in 54 (68%) patients and 1.0 U/mL or greater in 13 (16%) patients. A shorter interval since the last dose (P < 0.001) and a higher body mass index (P = 0.001) were associated with higher preoperative anti-Xa heparin levels.

Limitations

The small sample size limits accurate estimates of the frequency of the clinical outcomes. A single regimen of LMWH was evaluated.

Conclusions

Anti-Xa heparin levels often remain high at the time of surgery if a last dose of a twice-daily regimen of LMWH is given the evening before surgery.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^115Lvtn5]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Heparin bridging — definition and dosing targets defines heparin bridging as administration of a short-acting anticoagulant, typically low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH), for an 8- to 10-day perioperative period during interruption of a VKA when the international normalized ratio (INR) is below the therapeutic range. A heparin bridging regimen is therapeutic-dose (or full-dose) LMWH, for example enoxaparin 1 mg/kg bid or 1.5 mg/kg daily, dalteparin 100 IU/kg bid or 200 IU/kg daily, or full-dose UFH to achieve a target activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 1.5- to 2-times the control aPTT or a target anti-factor Xa level of 0.35–0.70 IU/mL. Although intermediate-dose LMWH regimens (eg, enoxaparin 40 mg bid) have been referred to as bridging, the definition and associated recommendations pertain to therapeutic-dose heparin bridging to prevent arterial thromboembolism (ATE), and this is the bridging dose regimen that has been most widely studied; heparin bridging should also be distinguished from perioperative use of low-dose LMWH (eg, enoxaparin 40 mg daily, dalteparin 5,000 IU daily) administered for prophylaxis against postoperative VTE rather than prevention of ATE.

### Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban versus enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis after total hip or knee replacement: systematic review, meta-analysis, and indirect treatment comparisons [^113vixLZ]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis indicates that a higher efficacy of the new type of anticoagulant is generally associated with a higher bleeding tendency in patients undergoing total hip or knee replacement surgery. At the time of balancing efficacy (symptomatic venous thromboembolism) and safety (major bleed and deaths), the different anticoagulants did not differ significantly.

Rivaroxaban seems more effective than enoxaparin in preventing symptomatic venous thromboembolism but at the cost of an increase in clinically relevant bleeds. These results were consistent across different studies, without evidence of heterogeneity.

Dabigatran seems at least as effective as enoxaparin in the risk of symptomatic venous thromboembolism, but the results are noticeable by heterogeneity and wide confidence intervals. Surrogate venographic data on major and total venous thromboembolism indicates that the high dose (220 mg) is consistently non-inferior to enoxaparin. The low dabigatran dose (150 mg) may provide an alternative in patients with anticipated increased exposure to dabigatran, such as those aged more than 75 years and those with moderate renal impairment. In our meta-analysis, the risk of clinically relevant bleeding was not significantly different between dabigatran and enoxaparin. The upper limit of the 95% confidence interval, however, indicates that a relative risk of clinically relevant bleeding with dabigatran versus enoxaparin by 35% cannot be excluded.

Apixaban was associated with a lower rate of clinically relevant bleeding than enoxaparin, mainly in knee pivotal studies, but associated with an increase in cases of pulmonary embolism, also in knee pivotal studies. Symptomatic pulmonary embolism occurs earlier in knee replacement surgery than in hip replacement surgery, which might theoretically result in an increase in risk of early pulmonary embolism if the first dose of the anticoagulant is delayed. Whether the benefit in bleeding and the numerical increase in pulmonary embolism in knee studies are a chance finding or due to the delay of the first apixaban dose about 18 hours after surgery (mean in pivotal trials) deserves further scrutiny. Doctors may consider the potential benefits of earlier anticoagulation for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis as well as the risks of post-surgical bleeding in deciding on when to administer within the approved time window (12 to 24 hours after surgery for apixaban).

Our meta-analysis also shows that the definition of major bleeding may have a significant impact on the apparent safety of the anticoagulants and that even difficult to perceive changes in the definitions may lead to different conclusions in the benefit-risk balance.

Post-operative DOAC/LMWH resumption timing — flexibility with the timing of post-operative direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) resumption is warranted because a peak anticoagulant effect occurs within 2 to 4 hours after administration, and this is especially pertinent if patients develop greater than expected post-operative bleeding.

### Enoxaparin as bridging anticoagulant treatment in cardiac surgery [^117HMPBr]. Heart (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess enoxaparin as bridging anticoagulant treatment in cardiac surgery.

Methods

Prospective registry of those patients who underwent cardiac surgery in our centre between December 2003 and June 2004 and required long-term anticoagulation. Subcutaneous enoxaparin was used as bridging anticoagulant treatment according to a pre-established protocol. The global thromboembolic risk was carefully assessed in all patients. All patients were followed up for 3 months.

Results

Of 140 patients who were included (mean (SD) age 66 (11); 49% female), 51 were already receiving long-term acenocumarol treatment before the index intervention. 50% of the patients were at high or very high risk for thromboembolic events in the postoperative period. The mean (SD) number of days between surgery and the first dose of anticoagulant was 2.01 (7) for acenocumarol and 1 (1.01) for enoxaparin. The mean (SD) daily dose of enoxaparin was 1.1 (0.27) mg/kg. Six thromboembolic events (4.3%; 95% CI 1.6 to 9.1) occurred, but only four of them were plausibly related to enoxaparin (2.9%; 95% CI 0.8 to 7.1). Six major haemorrhagic events (4.3%; 95% CI 1.6 to 9.1) occurred, but only three were plausibly related to enoxaparin (2.1%; 95% CI 0.4 to 6.1).

Conclusions

These findings show a reasonable rate of adverse events using enoxaparin as bridging anticoagulant treatment in cardiac surgery. Randomised studies are necessary to evaluate the real efficacy and safety of enoxaparin as bridging anticoagulant treatment in cardiac surgery.

### STS / SCA / AmSECT / SABM update to the clinical practice guidelines on patient blood management [^117JSePC]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Preoperative anticoagulants — elective cardiac surgery interruption and laboratory assessment notes that, given the predictable and rather short half-life to NOACs, in the elective setting, discontinuation for at least 2 days before surgery is recommended, with renal impairment requiring extending this discontinuation for additional days in select situations. Literature cites 2 recent retrospective studies confirming increased bleeding complications with preoperative NOAC therapy, with 1 study advocating consideration of longer discontinuation periods before elective cardiac surgery. For emergent care, point-of-care thrombin clotting time for dabigatran and anti-factor Xa assays for apixaban and rivaroxaban can aid in determining the anticoagulant effect, and the use of these laboratory tests is recommended if readily available.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic medications… [^1136WZW8]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of Vitamin K Antagonist Medications For patients taking the vitamin K antagonist warfarin, continue the medication if bleeding risk is minimal. With low to moderate or high bleeding risk, stop warfarin; patients with high thrombosis risk should receive heparin before and after surgery. In patients who are at low to moderate risk for thromboembolism, no bridging with heparin is recommended. For atrial fibrillation, the benefits of bridging are less certain because the stroke risk over a few days is low. Warfarin should be stopped at least five days before the procedure and restarted 12 to 24 hours after the procedure if hemostasis has been obtained. Heparin bridging can occur with unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin. If intravenous unfractionated heparin is used, heparin should be stopped at least four hours before the procedure and restarted at least 24 hours after the procedure.

If low-molecular-weight heparin is used, give one-half the daily dosage 24 hours before the procedure, and wait at least 24 hours after surgery to give the first postoperative dose of low-molecular-weight heparin. If the surgery has a high bleeding risk, wait 48 to 72 hours before restarting heparin to ensure hemostasis. Management of Antiplatelet Medications Continuing aspirin is recommended for all noncardiac surgery. If stopping aspirin, the American College of Chest Physicians recommends stopping within seven days of surgery. P2Y. 12 platelet receptor inhibitors should be stopped before surgery. Stop clopidogrel five days before surgery, ticagrelor three to five days before surgery, and prasugrel seven to 10 days before surgery. All P2Y 12 inhibitors can be restarted within 24 hours of surgery if hemostasis has been obtained. 12 inhibitor and continue aspirin therapy.

Bridging these gaps with antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications does not improve outcomes. Because these medications can be held one to two days before surgery and restarted one to two days after surgery, bridging with heparin is not recommended, unlike with warfarin. The other interesting recommendation is to continue aspirin through the surgery because of little, if any, increase in bleeding. — Michael J. Arnold, MD, Assistant Medical Editor.

### Updated guidelines to reduce venous thromboembolism in trauma patients: a Western Trauma Association critical decisions algorithm [^11498byw]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Pending Surgery

As discussed in section G, routinely holding pharmacologic prophylaxis because of pending surgery is only indicated, with few exceptions, for brain or spine surgery. Given the delays and cancellations of cases that may occur during trauma patient care, holding pharmacologic prophylaxis preoperatively can cause days of missed pharmacologic prophylaxis. Preoperative pharmacologic prophylaxis is safe for trauma patients, and leads to a lower VTE rate. The preoperative administration of pharmacologic prophylaxis is also encouraged for surgical patients in other specialties who have a high VTE risk and leads to a lower DVT rate without increasing the complication rate.– The lower VTE rate is lost if pharmacologic prophylaxis is provided more than 12 hours preoperatively.

Epidural Catheter

Epidural catheters reduce morbidity and mortality in trauma patients sustaining chest injuries and are often a component of multimodal pain strategies. Patients who require an epidural catheter increasingly have interruptions in pharmacologic prophylaxissuch that epidural catheter placement is now associated with an increased VTE rate, whereas previously this was not the case. Regional Anesthesia Guidelines recommend a 12-hour interval between enoxaparin dose and epidural placement/removal followed by a 4-hour to 12-hour interval before resumption. If enoxaparin is scheduled at 10and 10, the morning dose may be held for 10 AM epidural catheter placement/removal to allow for the necessary 12-hour interval without pharmacological prophylaxis. At 10 PM, the scheduled enoxaparin dosing may resume, so only one dose is missed. If higher doses of enoxaparin are required for pharmacologic prophylaxis, Regional Anesthesia Guidelines recommend a 24-hour interval for therapeutic enoxaparin before epidural catheter placement/removal followed by a 4-hour to 12-hour interval before resumption, indicating that, at most, two doses of enoxaparin should be missed for any enoxaparin therapy. Anti-Xa–guided enoxaparin doses are encouraged with limited interruption to reverse the higher VTE rate associated with epidural use. For unfractionated heparin, a 4 to 6-hour interval is recommended before epidural placement/removal followed by a 1-hour interval before unfractionated heparin is resumed, which allows for uninterrupted dosing.

14.3 Prophylaxis of Thromboembolic Events Following Hip Replacement Surgery in Adult Patients

In 2 randomized, double-blind, clinical trials in patients undergoing hip replacement surgery, ARIXTRA 2.5 mg subcutaneously once daily was compared to either enoxaparin sodium 30 mg subcutaneously every 12 hours (Study 1) or to enoxaparin sodium 40 mg subcutaneously once a day (Study 2). In Study 1, a total of 2,275 patients were randomized and 2,257 were treated. Patients ranged in age from 18 years to 92 years (mean age 65 years) with 48% men and 52% women. Patients were 94% Caucasian, 4% black, less than 1% Asian, and 2% others. In Study 2, a total of 2,309 patients were randomized and 2,273 were treated. Patients ranged in age from 24 years to 97 years (mean age 65 years) with 42% men and 58% women. Patients were 99% Caucasian, and 1% other races. Patients with serum creatinine level more than 2 mg/dL (180 micromol/L), or platelet count less than 100,000/mm³were excluded from both trials. In Study 1, ARIXTRA was initiated 6 ± 2 hours (mean 6.5 hours) after surgery in 92% of patients and enoxaparin sodium was initiated 12 hours to 24 hours (mean 20.25 hours) after surgery in 97% of patients. In Study 2, ARIXTRA was initiated 6 ± 2 hours (mean 6.25 hours) after surgery in 86% of patients and enoxaparin sodium was initiated 12 hours before surgery in 78% of patients. The first post-operative enoxaparin sodium dose was given within 12 hours after surgery in 60% of patients and 12 hours to 24 hours after surgery in 35% of patients with a mean of 13 hours. For both studies, both study treatments were continued for 7 ± 2 days. The efficacy data are provided in Table 12. Under the conditions of Study 1, ARIXTRA was associated with a VTE rate of 6.1% compared with a VTE rate of 8.3% for enoxaparin sodium for a relative risk reduction of 26% (95% CI: -11%, 53%; P = NS). Under the conditions of Study 2, fondaparinux sodium was associated with a VTE rate of 4.1% compared with a VTE rate of 9.2% for enoxaparin sodium for a relative risk reduction of 56% (95% CI: 33%, 73%; P < 0.001). For the 2 studies combined, the major bleeding episodes occurred in 3% of patients receiving ARIXTRA and 2.1% of enoxaparin sodium patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### The rates of bleeding and venous thromboembolism with reduced-dose enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis in low-weight surgical patients: a retrospective cohort study [^112GCBzC]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Low body weight is a recognized risk factor for bleeding with standard enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis (40 mg daily). Although reduced enoxaparin doses are used for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention in low-weight patients, data on bleeding and VTE outcomes remain limited.

Objective

To evaluate rates of bleeding and VTE with the use of fixed dose of enoxaparin 30 mg daily in low-weight surgical patients.‎Methods:A retrospective, single-center cohort study included low-weight surgical patients who received enoxaparin 30 mg daily from January 2018 to March 2024. The primary outcome was major ‎bleeding within 30 days postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included rates of overall bleeding ‎‎(major plus clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding) within 30 days and VTE events within 90 days. Risk factors were examined using logistic regression analysis or χ² tests.

Results

Data from 129 patients were analyzed. Six (4.7%) patients experienced major bleeding without fatality or bleeding at a critical anatomic site. The overall bleeding rate was 17.1% (n = 22). Five (3.8%) patients developed a VTE, including 2 pulmonary embolism events. Decreasing body weight (odds ratio [OR] = 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.81–0.97, P = 0.01), lower preoperative hemoglobin (OR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.97–0.99, P = 0.04), and longer surgery durations (OR = 1.2, 95% CI = 1.05–1.40, P = 0.007) were independently associated with an increased risk of developing a bleeding event.

Conclusion and Relevance

In low-weight surgical patients, thromboprophylaxis with a reduced fixed dose of enoxaparin (30 mg daily) appears safe, with a major bleeding rate below 5%, comparable with rates observed with standard dosing thromboprophylaxis in landmark trials of surgical patients. Among low-weight patients, the lower body weight, preoperative anemia, and prolonged surgical duration were independently associated with increased bleeding risk. These findings highlight the importance of individualized risk assessment when considering a reduced fixed dose of enoxaparin for VTE prevention in low-weight patients undergoing surgery.
