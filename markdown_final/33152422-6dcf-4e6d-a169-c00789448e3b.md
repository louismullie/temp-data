## Question

how long to keep nasal packing for epistaxis in a pt on anticoag

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long to keep nasal packing in place for epistaxis in a patient who is on anticoagulation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the type of packing (resorbable versus nonresorbable) because that dictates whether removal is needed. Then, I should verify guideline-based duration ranges for nonresorbable packing and whether anticoagulation changes that timeline. Next, I will examine the risks of prolonged packing and how anticoagulation modifies those risks. After that, I need to consider patient-specific factors like anterior versus posterior bleeding, INR or DOAC status, and comorbidities. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation and outline follow-up and patient education points, including alternatives like topical tranexamic acid if packing is not favored.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: in patients on anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy, guidelines preferentially recommend resorbable packing because it avoids the trauma of removal and reduces rebleeding risk, so if resorbable material is used, there is no scheduled removal and duration is "until absorbed", typically several days with saline sprays to hasten dissolution [^111CCYZS] [^114MrX2x] [^115Cieyr] [^112THg3C].

> Wait, let me verify the duration question for nonresorbable packing, since that is where timing matters most. The AAO-HNS guideline intentionally does not specify a single duration, but it advises avoiding prolonged packing and notes that typical durations range from 48 to 72 hours, with some series showing good control at 1 to 3 days. Patient education materials often advise not exceeding about 5 days to mitigate complications, which aligns with common practice patterns [^1155C1nG] [^112r4kfm] [^112THg3C].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — does anticoagulation mandate a shorter nonresorbable packing duration? The guideline does not provide a different duration solely for anticoagulated patients, but it emphasizes minimizing packing duration and using resorbable materials when possible. Clinically, many clinicians aim for the shorter end of the 48–72 hour window in anticoagulated patients to balance hemostasis against mucosal injury and rebleeding on removal, while ensuring stability before removal [^1155C1nG] [^111CCYZS] [^114MrX2x].

> I need to check the complication risks that scale with time, because that should inform duration choices. Prolonged nonresorbable packing increases risks such as infection, pressure injury, synechiae, and septal perforation; a recent case-control study found each additional day of packing increased the odds of septal perforation by 77%, and bilateral packing further increased risk, reinforcing the principle to minimize duration and avoid bilateral packing unless absolutely necessary [^112r4kfm] [^115b6FwD].

> Let me consider bleeding severity and location, since posterior bleeds often require more robust packing and closer monitoring. For severe posterior epistaxis, some interventional literature historically allowed up to 48 hours for posterior packs, but contemporary practice favors early definitive therapy (endoscopic ligation or embolization) if packing fails to control bleeding, and prolonged posterior packing is associated with high recurrence and morbidity; thus, duration should be as brief as feasible with expedited escalation if bleeding persists [^111WAqNw] [^116BZt8C].

> I should confirm anticoagulation-specific management steps that interact with packing decisions. In non–life-threatening epistaxis, guidelines recommend initiating first-line local measures, including packing, before reversing anticoagulation or transfusing; for VKA users, check INR and consider reversal only if bleeding is severe or refractory, recognizing that overcorrection increases thrombotic risk; for DOACs, routine lab assays are unreliable, and supportive local control is prioritized, with reversal reserved for life-threatening bleeding or when specific reversal agents are indicated [^113MyRv7] [^114V68Lv] [^116vKXNV].

> But wait, what if we want to avoid packing altogether in an anticoagulated patient? Topical tranexamic acid is a reasonable alternative or adjunct. Randomized trials and meta-analyses show faster hemostasis and reduced short-term rebleeding compared with standard packing in some settings, though results vary by comparator and patient population, so TXA can be considered especially for anterior bleeds or when packing is undesirable, while recognizing that evidence quality is mixed and local expertise varies [^112m9RgL] [^114U6g8E] [^112TQfSa].

> Let me synthesize a practical answer. For an anticoagulated patient with epistaxis requiring nonresorbable packing, I would target 48 to 72 hours if hemostasis is achieved, avoid exceeding 5 days whenever possible, and plan removal once the patient is hemodynamically stable and any coagulopathy is reasonably addressed. If bleeding is controlled sooner, earlier removal is reasonable, and if bleeding persists beyond 72 hours, reassess for definitive intervention rather than extending packing indefinitely [^112r4kfm] [^112THg3C] [^112S85kN].

> I should double-check patient education and follow-up elements that influence outcomes. Patients should be counseled on the type of packing, the removal plan, saline sprays to keep packing moist, activity restrictions, and red flags for rebleeding or complications. Clinicians should document outcomes within 30 days, and arrange close follow-up after pack removal given recurrence risk is highest in the first 4 hours and remains substantial within a week [^1127WPDc] [^114eq2jp] [^1115arvU] [^116BZt8C].

> In summary, I need to ensure the core message is clear: prefer resorbable packing when feasible so no removal is needed. If nonresorbable packing is required in an anticoagulated patient, aim for 48–72 hours, avoid exceeding 5 days if at all possible, and individualize based on bleeding control, INR or anticoagulant context, and comorbidities, with early escalation to definitive therapy if bleeding persists or complications emerge [^111CCYZS] [^1155C1nG] [^112r4kfm] [^112THg3C].

---

For patients with epistaxis on anticoagulation, **resorbable packing is preferred** [^111CCYZS] and should remain in place until fully absorbed, typically 3–5 days, with no need for removal [^112THg3C]. If non-resorbable packing is used, **keep it for 48–72 hours** [^112r4kfm] to balance hemostasis with infection and mucosal injury risk; avoid exceeding 5 days [^112THg3C]. Prolonged packing increases the risk of infection, mucosal injury, and rebleeding, so monitor closely and reassess within 24–48 hours [^112S85kN] [^112THg3C].

## Recommended duration of nasal packing

### Resorbable packing

For resorbable packing, **duration** is 3–5 days until fully absorbed; **removal** is not required [^116cHQ1W] [^112THg3C].

---

### Non-resorbable packing

For non-resorbable packing, **duration** is 48–72 hours [^112r4kfm]; **rationale** is to balance hemostasis with infection and mucosal injury risk [^115b6FwD].

---

## Factors influencing duration of packing

Several factors influence the **duration of nasal packing** in anticoagulated patients:

| **Factor** | **Influence on duration** |
|-|-|
| Severity of bleeding | Severe bleeding may require longer packing duration (up to 5 days) [^113G3whD] [^112THg3C] |
| Type of anticoagulant | - Warfarin: INR levels influence duration and need for reversal <br/> - DOACs: Shorter half-lives may allow shorter packing duration [^114V68Lv] [^112ih2LX] |
| Patient comorbidities | Hypertension, renal impairment, and other comorbidities may prolong packing duration [^notfound] |
| Packing material | - Resorbable materials: Preferred in anticoagulated patients <br/> - Non-resorbable materials: Shorter duration recommended [^111CCYZS] [^114MrX2x] |

---

## Risks associated with prolonged nasal packing

Prolonged nasal packing in anticoagulated patients carries **significant risks**, including:

- **Infection**: Sinusitis, toxic shock syndrome, and other infections [^116Ure5b].

- **Mucosal injury**: Septal perforation, synechiae, and mucosal necrosis [^112r4kfm].

- **Rebleeding**: Increased risk upon pack removal [^116BZt8C].

- **Patient discomfort**: Significant pain and discomfort, especially with non-resorbable materials [^115Cieyr].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) provides **specific recommendations** for nasal packing in anticoagulated patients:

- **Resorbable packing**: Preferred in patients on anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy [^111CCYZS] [^114MrX2x].

- **Non-resorbable packing**: Use only when necessary, and limit duration to 48–72 hours [^112r4kfm].

- **Patient education**: Inform patients about the type of packing, duration, and signs of complications [^1127WPDc] [^114eq2jp].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up is essential to monitor for **complications** and ensure successful hemostasis. Within 24–48 hours, reassess for rebleeding, infection, and mucosal injury, and document outcomes within 30 days or ensure transition of care [^1115arvU] [^1176pAjU].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Resorbable packing**: Preferred in anticoagulated patients; duration 3–5 days without removal [^111CCYZS] [^112THg3C].

- **Non-resorbable packing**: Limit to 48–72 hours; avoid exceeding 5 days [^112r4kfm] [^112THg3C].

- **Monitoring**: Regular follow-up within 24–48 hours to assess for complications [^notfound].

- **Patient education**: Inform patients about packing type, duration, and signs of complications [^1127WPDc] [^114eq2jp].

---

The **recommended duration** of nasal packing in anticoagulated patients is 3–5 days for resorbable materials and 48–72 hours for non-resorbable materials. Prolonged packing increases the risk of infection, mucosal injury, and rebleeding, necessitating close monitoring and regular follow-up.

LITERATURE REVIEW

In 2019, Akkan et al. conducted a prospective, randomized controlled trial of 135 patients with spontaneous anterior epistaxis. This study compared three treatment options: local application of TXA with an atomizer followed by nasal compression, nasal packing with Merocel packs, and nasal compression. The primary outcome was resolution of anterior epistaxis after 15 min and the secondary outcome was rebleeding rate within 24 h. There was no significant difference in cessation of epistaxis between the tranexamic acid and the packing groups, and there was a significantly higher success rate when comparing those two groups with the compression only group. In terms of rebleeding at 24 h, 86.7% of patients in the TXA group, 74% in the nasal packing group, and 60% in the compression group did not rebleed. Results from this study suggest that TXA combined with pressure is as effective as nasal packing with Merocel for anterior epistaxis.

In 2020, Reuben et al. conducted a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, multicenter randomized controlled trial across the United Kingdom. This study consisted of 496 patients presenting to the ED with spontaneous epistaxis which persisted after initial treatment with topical vasoconstriction. Patients received either topical TXA on a cotton wool dental roll or placebo (sterile water) for 10 min with up to two trial treatments if the first application did not resolve the bleeding. The primary outcome of interest was the need for anterior nasal packing, with secondary outcomes of hospital admission, need for blood transfusion, recurrent bleeding, and thrombotic events. In terms of packing, the authors found no significant difference between the TXA and placebo groups. There were also no statistically significant differences between groups for secondary outcome measures. This study therefore suggests that topical TXA is no more effective than placebo at reducing need for nasal packing. Limitations of this study include the possibility of selection bias as the authors note some participants were excluded due to research nurse availability. Another limitation is that a lower dose of TXA was used when compared to other studies and the comparison was saline rather than a topical vasoconstricting agent.

Preprocedure Preparation

Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging is not typically indicated for the investigation of epistaxis unless tumour or other local diseases are suspected as an underlying cause. Idiopathic epistaxis is classified after exclusion of local or systemic causes. The interventional radiologist should be aware of the laterality of the nose bleed, the current severity of bleeding, and the patient's history. These factors are crucial in deciding whether general anaesthesia is required for the procedure. General anaesthesia is routinely used only in children, noncompliant patients, and patients having uncontrolled epistaxis with possible compromise of the airway. The majority of embolisation procedures can be performed with intravenous sedation and analgesia with standard monitoring of blood pressure, electrocardiogram, and pulse oxymetry. Nasal packing, which is radiopaque, should be avoided in patients who might be candidates for embolotherapy.

Underlying Coagulopathy

The presence of any underlying coagulopathy should be evaluated because embolisation with polyvinylalcohol (PVA) microparticles is more effective in patients with normal platelet and plasma protein functions.

A proposed protocol for anticoagulants and epistaxis is as follows:

Angiography and Embolisation

Complete selective external and internal carotid angiograms are essential to evaluation. Angiograms should be analysed for the detection for arterial variants and anastomoses between branches originating from the external carotid and internal carotid arteries. Standard catheterisation of the common carotid artery (CCA) is performed. Depending on the type of the aortic arch, various diagnostic and guiding catheters are selected. The most frequently used are vertebral, Berenstein, Davis, Simmons, or Vitek catheters. A 5F or 6F guide catheter permits angiography while a microcatheter is in the target artery. A standard continual pressure flush with heparinised normal saline must be used to prevent the backflow of blood into the guiding catheter.

The first injection of 7–10 mL of iodinated contrast medium into the CCA is performed using the posterioanterior and lateral views. The angiogram should show any potential arterial pathology at the common carotid artery bifurcation, including atherosclerotic plaque or occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) (Table 3). Because the majority of posterior epistaxis episodes treated by embolisation are idiopathic, angiographic findings in these cases may be normal. Specific angiographic signs are rare and may include the following: tumour blush, telangiectasia, traumatic pseudoaneurysm, and even contrast extravasation. Selective ICA angiography may show other sources of epistaxis, such as mycotic or traumatic aneurysm.

### Treatment disparities in the management of epistaxis in United States emergency departments [^116wyrUm]. The Laryngoscope (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

There is limited data on epistaxis presentation and management patterns in U.S. emergency departments (EDs). We aim to characterize patients who present to the ED with epistaxis and identify factors associated with nasal-packing use.

Study Design

Retrospective review of Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) from 2009 to 2011.

Methods

NEDS was queried for patient visits with a primary diagnosis of epistaxis (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code 784.7). Patient demographics, comorbidities, and hospital characteristics were obtained. Predictors of nasal packing were determined by multivariable logistic regression.

Results

There were 1,234,267 ED visits for epistaxis. The highest proportion of patients were seen in the winter (37.2%) at nontrauma hospitals (76.9%), and were discharged home (95.5%). Fifteen percent of patients were on long-term anticoagulation, 33% had hypertension, and 0.9% had a coagulopathy. Nasal packing was utilized in 243,268 patients (19.7%). Predictors strongly associated with nasal packing included lower socioeconomic quartile (odds ratio [OR] 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10–1.53), hospital located in the geographic South (OR 1.62, CI = 1.12–2.34) and Midwest (OR 1.85, P < 0.0001), and nontrauma hospital (OR 1.56, CI = 1.19–2.05). Other factors included long-term anticoagulation (OR 1.21, CI = 1.10–1.33), winter season (OR 1.20, CI = 1.12–1.23), male gender (OR 1.14, CI = 1.10–1.17), and older age (OR 1.01, CI = 1.01–1.02). Mean ED charge was greater for patients who were packed ($1,473 vs. $1,048, P < 0.0001).

Conclusion

Several factors, including lower socioeconomic status, geographic location, and nontrauma hospital designation, predict use of nasal packing. These results raise concerns about potential treatment disparities that may result in increased patient morbidity and costs.

### Topical tranexamic acid compared with anterior nasal packing for treatment of epistaxis in patients taking antiplatelet drugs: randomized controlled trial [^112m9RgL]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

We evaluated the efficacy of topical application of the injectable form of tranexamic acid (TXA) compared with anterior nasal packing (ANP) for the treatment of epistaxis in patients taking antiplatelet drugs (aspirin, clopidogrel, or both) who presented to the emergency department (ED).

Methods

A randomized, parallel-group clinical trial was conducted at two EDs. A total of 124 participants were randomized to receive topical TXA (500 mg in 5 mL) or ANP, 62 patients per group. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients in each group whose bleeding had stopped at 10 minutes. Secondary outcomes were the rebleeding rate at 24 hours and 1 week, ED length of stay (LOS), and patient satisfaction.

Results

Within 10 minutes of treatment, bleeding was stopped in 73% of the patients in the TXA group, compared with 29% in the ANP group (difference = 44%, 95% confidence interval, 26% to 57%; p < 0.001). Additionally, rebleeding was reported in 5 and 10% of patients during the first 24 hours in the TXA and the ANP groups, respectively. At 1 week, 5% of patients in the TXA group and 21% of patients in the ANP group had experienced recurrent bleeding (p = 0.007). Patients in the TXA group reported higher satisfaction scores (median [interquartile range {IQR}], 9 [8–9.25]) compared with the ANP group (median [IQR] = 4 [3–5]; p < 0.001). Discharge from the ED in < 2 hours was achieved in 97% of patients in the TXA group versus 13% in the ANP group (p < 0.001). There were no adverse events reported in either group.

Conclusions

In our study population, epistaxis treatment with topical application of TXA resulted in faster bleeding cessation, less rebleeding at 1 week, shorter ED LOS, and higher patient satisfaction compared with ANP.

### The combined use of two rapidRhino packs instead of anteroposterior packing for the control of severe epistaxis [^112EH3mg]. The Laryngoscope (2011). Low credibility.

Epistaxis is a common ear, nose, and throat emergency, and severe cases are traditionally controlled by the placement of anteroposterior nasal packing. In this article, a way of controlling severe epistaxis with the combination of two RapidRhino packs is described. Although not always successful, it is a technique that in the majority of patients can control severe bleeding faster, easier, with decreased pain, and increased patient comfort, compared to the traditional anteroposterior nasal packing.

### Risk of nasal septal perforation following nasal packing for epistaxis in the emergency department [^115b6FwD]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nasal packing is commonly employed in the emergency department (ED) to manage epistaxis that does not respond to conservative treatments. However, this intervention may increase the risk of nasal septal perforation (NSP) due to reduced blood flow to the nasal septum. No prior study has explored the relationship between nasal packing and risk of NSP.

Methods

We examined all patients who received non-absorbable nasal packing in the ED at our institution, identifying 19 patients diagnosed with NSP post-treatment and 50 randomly selected patients without NSP for comparison. t-Tests and Chi square tests were utilized to compare numeric and categoric variables respectively and a multivariable logistic regression model was developed to assess risk factors.

Results

Baseline characteristics of individuals who developed NSP were similar to those of the comparison group, with the exception of tobacco use. Interestingly, individuals with NSP had a lower rate of tobacco use (21% vs 64% current/former users, p = 0.004). Univariable analysis revealed that patients with NSP had a longer mean duration of nasal packing (5 vs 3 days, p = 0.001). Multivariable analysis showed that each additional day of packing increased odds of NSP by 77%, and bilateral packing, compared to unilateral, was associated with four times the odds of NSP.

Conclusions

Our findings indicate that prolonged nasal packing increases the risk of NSP. Prospective, large-scale studies are needed to identify patients at risk for NSP after nasal packing in the ED and to inform guidelines on the removal of nasal packing.

### Standardization of terminology, definitions, and outcome criteria for bleeding in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: International Consensus Report [^115bpcMt]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

4.5 Major Acute Bleeding

While most bleeding in HHT is chronic, in recognition of the seriousness and life‐threatening potential of acute bleeds, the expert panel defined a major acute bleed in HHT by adapting the definition for major bleeding from the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis to best reflect the HHT disease state. A major acute bleed in HHT is defined as satisfying one or more of the following criteria: (1) acute‐onset severe epistaxis or gastrointestinal bleeding necessitating urgent intervention performed by a healthcare provider (e.g. nasal packing, administration of intravenous antifibrinolytic, or ablative procedure); (2) pulmonary, central nervous system, or other solid organ bleeding due to a ruptured AVM; (3) acute bleeding that results in a drop in hemoglobin of ≥ 2 g/dL over a 24‐h period; or (4) acute bleeding that results in hemodynamic instability or a requirement for packed red cell transfusion (in excess of the individual's baseline maintenance red cell transfusion requirements, if any).

### Management of epistaxis [^1177ydtC]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Family physicians frequently encounter patients with epistaxis (nasal bleeding). In rare cases, this condition may lead to massive bleeding and even death. Although epistaxis can have an anterior or posterior source, it most often originates in the anterior nasal cavity. A directed history and physical examination generally determine the cause of the bleeding. Both local and systemic processes can play a role in epistaxis. Nasal bleeding usually responds to first-aid measures such as compression. When epistaxis does not respond to simple measures, the source of the bleeding should be located and treated appropriately. Treatments to be considered include topical vasoconstriction, chemical cautery, electrocautery, nasal packing (nasal tampon or gauze impregnated with petroleum jelly), posterior gauze packing, use of a balloon system (including a modified Foley catheter), and arterial ligation or embolization. Topical or systemic antibiotics should be used in selected patients. Hospital admission should be considered for patients with significant comorbid conditions or complications of blood loss. Referral to an otolaryngologist is appropriate when bleeding is refractory, complications are present, or specialized treatment (balloon placement, arterial ligation, angiographic arterial embolization) is required.

### Monitoring warfarin therapy… [^116uJFYd]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

A 52-year-old man presented with severe epistaxis of two hours' duration. In 1996, he had undergone surgery to replace a congenital bicuspid aortic valve. The patient's medication included warfarin, in a dosage of 12. 5 mg per day. He denied taking any other medication or herbal remedies, receiving direct trauma to the nose, or having hematuria, back pain or hematochezia. On physical examination, he was hemodynamically stable and neurologically intact, although he had bleeding from the left nostril. Laboratory studies demonstrated a prothrombin time of 24. 0, an International Normalized Ratio of
4. 65 and a hemoglobin level of 150 g per L. Local measures to control the bleeding failed. Hemostasis was ultimately achieved by placing anteroposterior packing soaked in bacitracin, oxymetazoline and 4 percent cocaine solution. The patient declined readmission for heparin anticoagulation therapy and was followed daily in our clinic.

The lowest hemoglobin level was 102 g per L. Nasal packing was removed after five days without incident, and the patient was restarted on his usual dosage of warfarin. His response was still subtherapeutic when he returned home five days later. By administering vitamin K and plasma, coagulopathy was corrected at the cost of increasing the risk of systemic embolism. The cost of fresh frozen plasma and the risk of infection are factors to consider. A more elegant solution, as outlined by Drs. Horton and Bushwick, would have been to hold off the warfarin therapy, follow the PT and INR values, and restart warfarin therapy at a lower dosage while watching for bleeding. In the case presented, the patient experienced epistaxis at an International Normalized Ratio of 4. 65 that required treatment with nasal packing.

Recent literature suggests that if rapid reversal were necessary, the administration of intravenous vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma and prothrombin complex concentrate would be indicated. Rapid reversal with intravenous vitamin K via slow infusion is safe, effective and more rapid than reversal with subcutaneous vitamin K; a minimum of six to 12 hours is necessary to evaluate responsiveness.

Nasal packing education — epistaxis guideline recommendation: The clinician should educate the patient who undergoes nasal packing about the type of packing placed, timing of and plan for removal of packing (if not resorbable), postprocedure care, and any signs or symptoms that would warrant prompt reassessment, with a recommendation based on observational studies and 1 systematic review with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C, based on observational studies and 1 systematic review, with a level of confidence in evidence of Medium. Benefits include reduce complications of packing, prompt recognition of complications, avoid prolonged packing duration, decrease patient anxiety, improve patient satisfaction, allow shared decision making regarding the decision to use prophylactic systemic antibiotics, and improve timing of appropriate follow-up, while risk, harm, cost include time for education and increase patient anxiety regarding potential complications. Benefit–harm assessment is preponderance of benefit over harm, and the policy level is Recommendation; a quality improvement opportunity is to improve patient education regarding care after nasal packing.

First aid for epistaxis — Recommendations are specified with class of recommendation (COR) and level of evidence (LOE) as follows: "1 C-LD 1. A person experiencing epistaxis should sit with their head slightly forward with their nostrils pinched for 10 to 15 minutes". Escalation thresholds include "1 C-EO 2. A person experiencing epistaxis that does not stop after 15 minutes of continuous manual pressure or who becomes lightheaded from epistaxis should seek medical attention". For trauma, "1 C-EO 3. A person with epistaxis due to trauma should seek medical attention if they experience signs of brain injury, obvious nasal deformity, or signs of facial fracture". For higher-risk patients, "2a C-LD 4. It is reasonable for a person experiencing epistaxis who is taking anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication, or who has a blood-clotting disorder, to seek care from a health care professional, unless bleeding has stopped". The guideline notes uncertainty regarding cooling: "2b C-LD 5. The usefulness of cryotherapy (ice) for managing epistaxis in the first aid setting is unknown". Context for this topic includes "ILCOR performed a systematic review of cryotherapy for epistaxis in 2021". and "An updated literature search was performed by the writing group in 2023".

The added benefit of octreotide and thalidomide has not been demonstrated, multidisciplinary care involving interventional gastroenterology and radiology is recommended, and for epistaxis (the second most common bleeding complication in LVAD patients) initial management entails topical vasoconstriction, cautery, and nasal packing/tamponade, with invasive embolization and supportive transfusion possibly required; early involvement of otolaryngology is advisable.

Nonendovascular Therapy for Epistaxis

The management of epistaxis should begin with general measures, including calming the patient (with sedatives if necessary), application of a cold compress to the nape of the neck, decreasing the blood pressure if the patient is hypertensive, fluid resuscitation, and correction of any underlying coagulopathy. Local measures include the following: various methods of bleeding control, such as local application of haemostatic agents, infiltration of the bleeding area with vasoconstrictive agents, and cautery. Anterior nasal packing is performed by positioning strips of ointment-saturated gauze so as to produce satisfactory pressure on the bleeding mucosa. Posterior nasal packing is an option if anterior packing is insufficient to stop the haemorrhage or if the bleeding originates posteriorly. Posterior nasal packing requires general anaesthesia. A balloon catheter is inflated in the nasopharynx to stop the flow of blood posteriorly, and the anterior part of the nasal cavity is packed. The catheter coming out of the nose is fixed in place. The patient should be monitored because posterior nasal packing can lead to nasal trauma, vasovagal reaction, and infection. Traditional gauze packing or balloon devices may be left in the nasal cavity for ≤ 48 h to prevent such complications. The success rate of posterior packing is reported to be between 48 and 83%. Subsequent therapy can include either surgical endonasal coagulation or ligation. An endoscopic approach has been used for direct electrocauterisation of the active bleeding site and endoscopic ligation of the sphenopalatine and ethmoidal arteries. Surgical intervention is clearly indicated in anterior ethmoid bleeding because the ethmoidal arteries arise from the ophthalmic artery, the embolisation of which is generally considered to be dangerous.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^111ZtVUK]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Nosebleed (epistaxis) — patient and caregiver education content and preventive measures: When the prevention of nosebleeds is discussed, it is important to understand that nose picking, trauma, infection, use of anticoagulant/antiplatelet medications, and hypertension are commonly associated with nosebleeds, and educating caregivers and patients that avoiding digital trauma or nose picking and use of simple nasal hygiene measures are primary strategies to avoid nosebleeds. While most experienced clinicians note that moisturizers and lubricants such as nasal saline, gels, and ointments and use of air humidifiers can help prevent nosebleeds, quality supportive evidence is scarce; in one study of children with recurrent nosebleeds, the nasal application of petroleum jelly twice a day did not reduce the number of nosebleeds. Patients who require nasal oxygen or CPAP should be encouraged to use humidification on their apparatus to decrease chances of drying the fragile mucosa of the nose and contributing to recurrent nosebleeds, and patients taking anticoagulants or antiplatelet medications are at an increased risk of recurrent epistaxis; thus, saline lubrication, as well as control of comorbidities, is recommended to prevent additional nosebleeds; preventive measures are also important following "first-line" therapies for management of acute nosebleed to prevent rebleeding and to avoid the need for more invasive interventions, and patients should be encouraged to restart saline and/or lubrication to moisturize the area and allow proper healing.

### Epistaxis: outpatient management [^114zpvtu]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Epistaxis is a common emergency encountered by primary care physicians. Up to 60% of the general population experience epistaxis, and 6% seek medical attention for it. More than 90% of cases arise from the anterior nasal circulation, and most treatments can be easily performed in the outpatient setting. Evaluation of a patient presenting with epistaxis should begin with assessment of vital signs, mental status, and airway patency. When examining the nose, a nasal speculum and a good light source, such as a headlamp, can be useful. Compressive therapy is the first step to controlling anterior epistaxis. Oxymetazoline nasal spray or application of cotton soaked in oxymetazoline or epinephrine 1: 1,000 may be useful adjuncts to compressive therapy. Directive nasal cautery, most commonly using silver nitrate, can be used to control localized continued bleeding or prominent vessels that are the suspected bleeding source. Finally, topical therapy and nasal packing can be used if other methods are unsuccessful. Compared with anterior epistaxis, posterior epistaxis is more likely to require hospitalization and twice as likely to need nasal packing. Posterior nasal packing is often associated with pain and a risk of aspiration if it is dislodged. After stabilization, patients with posterior packing often require referral to otolaryngology or the emergency department for definitive treatments.

Epistaxis guideline — initial assessment and first-line measures: At initial contact, clinicians should distinguish patients needing urgent care, and for those with active bleeding requiring prompt management they should use firm sustained compression of the lower third of the nose for 5 minutes or longer. If bleeding obscures site identification despite compression, clinicians should treat ongoing active bleeding with nasal packing and should use resorbable packing for suspected bleeding disorders or anticoagulation/antiplatelet use. Clinicians should educate packed patients about the type of packing, timing and plan for removal if not resorbable, postprocedure care, and symptoms warranting prompt reassessment; should document factors that increase frequency or severity of bleeding, including bleeding history, anticoagulant or antiplatelet use, or intranasal drug use; and should perform anterior rhinoscopy to identify a source of bleeding after removal of any blood clot (if present).

Epistaxis management in patients using anticoagulation or antiplatelet medications — The statement addresses "patients using anticoagulation medications… and antiplatelet medications" and notes they may "have a large volume of blood loss (> 250 mL)" and "require blood transfusion for treatment". Even for vitamin K antagonist (VKA) or heparin users, "the first step… is the use of 'first-line' treatments, including nasal compression, vasoconstrictors, moisturizing or lubricating agents, nasal cautery, and/or nasal packing". Reversal carries risks: "overcorrection of a patient's INR can increase risk of thromboembolic events" and "4-factor prothrombin complex concentrates or recombinant activated factor VII… may also induce hypercoagulability". For VKAs, "reversal strategy should be driven by the patient's clinical condition and bleeding severity as well as INR", and "Patients with an INR > 4.5 are more likely to require hospital admission and have prolonged hospital stays". For direct oral anticoagulants, "clotting assays such as prothrombin time/INR and partial thromboplastin time do not reliably reflect the degree of anticoagulation". Regarding antiplatelet therapy, the PATCH trial found transfusion recipients were "more likely to have an in-hospital adverse event and a higher 90-day mortality rate", and "Clinicians should balance the chance for benefit against the risk for harm when considering platelet transfusion". Adjunctive agents "do not specifically reverse… but they do improve hemostasis and are effective in treating mucocutaneous bleeding"; in a small randomized trial of antiplatelet users, topical tranexamic acid (TXA) achieved cessation within "10 minutes" with "73% vs 29%, respectively; P < .001" compared with standard anterior nasal packing.

Epistaxis — severity of bleeding can be gauged by duration and episode frequency, noting that a standard definition of severe epistaxis does not exist. Bleeding duration > 30 minutes over a 24-hour period was considered severe, and a history of hospitalization for nosebleed, prior blood transfusion for nosebleeds, or > 3 recent episodes of nasal bleeding may indicate the need for prompt evaluation. When evaluating, evidence of or suspicion for prolonged or large volume bleeding, bleeding from both sides of the nose or from the mouth, or any signs of acute hypovolemia should warrant prompt management.

### Does choice of nasal pack matter? A systematic review and meta-analysis of merocel and rapid rhino [^116YADGj]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Epistaxis is one of the most common rhinological emergencies. Management often involves nasal packing when initial measures fail. This paper compares Rapid Rhino (RR) and Merocel in the management and prevention of epistaxis.

Data Sources

Studies from Embase, PubMed and Medline were included.

Review Methods

A systematic review and subsequent meta-analysis were performed, pre-registered on PROSPERO and adhering to PRISMA guidelines. Studies were screened, followed by data extraction and risk of bias assessment. The meta-analysis was performed using Stata. Pain score effect size was based on raw means at packing removal, while rebleeding effect size used Freeman-Tukey's proportion. Pain score at removal and rebleeding requiring repacking was assessed.

Results

The systematic review yielded 4637 studies for screening, with 51 meeting inclusion criteria. In primary epistaxis, RR was associated with less pain upon insertion and removal. In the surgical setting, RR demonstrated superior hemostasis and greater patient comfort. The meta-analysis demonstrated that for post-surgical packing, RR was significantly less painful on removal than Merocel (Mean = 2.50 [1.72, 3.28] vs. 6.34 [5.58, 7.10]; p = 0.00). Similarly, for primary epistaxis, RR removal was significantly less painful than Merocel (Mean = 2.28 [0.95, 3.61] vs. 4.14 [3.31, 4.97]; p = 0.02). All tests of group differences for rebleeding demonstrated no significant differences between nasal packs.

Conclusion

RR was found to be significantly less painful upon removal in primary and post-surgical epistaxis. Although the systematic review demonstrates that RR is associated with less bleeding than Merocel, the meta-analysis demonstrated no statistically significant difference.

### Is topical tranexamic acid effective in treating epistaxis? [^115tw5TS]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Lastly, a systematic review and meta‐analysis was conducted by Janapala et al. This 2022 article included eight studies, seven of which were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including two of the articles previously discussed. Their review encompassed 1299 patients, and they concluded that TXA was more likely to achieve bleeding cessation at "first‐reassessment" than the control group (which could be placebo, vasoconstrictors, or vasoconstrictors with topical anesthetic). They also found that patients treated with TXA were less likely to rebleed between 1 and 3 days, but that there was no difference in rebleeding rates at the 7–8 day mark. This study is valuable because of the large number of patients and rigorous methodology. Unfortunately, half of the studies were flagged for having concern for bias, highlighting the importance of evaluating the underlying studies in a systematic review and meta‐analysis. Additionally, the authors excluded the study by Reuben et al.(which would have been the largest study) from their meta‐analysis, because the outcome was "need for nasal packing" and not specifically "bleeding cessation"; this may ultimately have affected their conclusion.

### Alternate nasal packing technique for patients experiencing epistaxis… [^111X6H6Y]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

To the Editor: The authors nicely described the traditional method for anterior-posterior nasal packing in patients with epistaxis. An alternative technique may improve posterior nosebleed management. The placement of expandable sponge or balloon packing has largely supplanted horizontally-layered gauze due to ease of use. The Rapid Rhino inflatable device has advantages over sponges because of its flexibility and smooth carboxymethyl cellulose hemostatic mesh envelope. Sponges, however, are rigid when dry and nasal abnormalities may preclude passage into the nasal cavity or abrade nasal mucosa creating secondary bleeding sites. The authors described a Foley urinary catheter as one option for the posterior pack, although they discuss more fully and illustrate the gauze technique. The catheter may be placed as the posterior pack much more easily and with less discomfort for the patient.

Active posterior hemorrhage commonly provokes patient gagging, which complicates positioning of the gauze above the soft palate at the posterior nasal choana. In contrast, one visualizes the Foley balloon in the oropharynx, inflates it, and then retracts it into position. The use of oxymetazoline avoids potential cardiovascular effects of phenylephrine and concentrated epinephrine. Oxymetazoline may be mixed at bedside in its own spray bottle with an equal amount of 4% liquid topical lidocaine. The combination may be sprayed into the nose or applied on unrolled cotton balls. Held horizontally, the bottle provides a generous stream rather than mist. Topical anesthetic/decongestant may be supplemented, as available, with intravenous ondansetron and an analgesic to improve patient comfort. The Foley is passed, inflated, and retracted into the nasopharynx while the assistant maintains firm forward traction. The Rapid Rhino is wetted, inserted, and inflated.

An unfolded four-inch gauze pad is wrapped around the Foley shaft to create a doughnut-shaped bolster and tape-wrapped around its circumference. This protects the nostril from pressure necrosis. An umbilical clamp is slid snuggly against the bolster to keep forward tension on the Foley shaft. Surgical ties placed around the Foley shaft prevent balloon deflation; the rest of the catheter shaft is trimmed. This reliable posterior packing method takes only a few minutes, and in my experience works better than commercial double-balloon products.

Rhinoplasty — nasal packing at conclusion of surgery: Surgeons should not routinely place packing in the nasal cavity of rhinoplasty patients (with or without septoplasty) at the conclusion of surgery, with a policy level of Recommendation against. Recommendation against, based on systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials with a preponderance of harm over benefit and a lack of studies regarding the benefits of nasal packing after rhinoplasty. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C and Level of confidence in evidence: Low, due to lack of studies, with Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm and Risk, harm, cost: Risk of epistaxis. Value judgments include that the use of nasal packing, in general, is declining among rhinoplasty surgeons and that, when packing is used, it is limited to 24 hours, and intentional vagueness notes the word "routinely" to allow clinicians discretion to identify patients who might benefit on an individualized basis. Exceptions are patients with epistaxis that requires packing for control, patients with complex, unstable nasal fractures that require packing for stability, and patients with a known bleeding/clotting disorder; Role of patient preferences is Moderate, and silastic stents or nasal splints and custom-cut sheeting are not considered packing.

Medication-associated epistaxis risk — anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications "increase the risk of nosebleeds", and clinicians "should ask patients about the use of these medications" and "inquire about recent changes in dosage or medication type". For patients on warfarin, an international normalized ratio (INR) should be checked "to evaluate if they are in the therapeutic range of anticoagulation"; "Supratherapeutic INR results may require specialty consultation, discontinuation of medications, or administration of reversal agents" if bleeding is severe or refractory. Intranasal medications, notably nasal corticosteroids, "can increase the risk of nosebleeds"; a systematic review of "13 randomized controlled studies, including > 2500 subjects" found intranasal corticosteroids "substantially increased the risk of nosebleeds, with a relative risk of 2.74 (range, 1.88–4.00)". "Cessation of nasal corticosteroids should be considered in patients with recurrent or severe nosebleeds", and "Other intranasal medications and drugs of abuse can precipitate nosebleeds and should be assessed in the history".

### Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: diagnosis and management from the hematologist's perspective [^116pN4VM]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Management of epistaxis

The first step in epistaxis management should always be appropriate patient counseling and use of preventive measures within the home to prevent the nasal mucosa from becoming dry. These may include nasal humidification, use of over-the-counter saline sprays or ointments to keep the nasal mucosa moist, and avoidance of nasal trauma (i.e. from nose blowing and/or nose picking).

When epistaxis occurs that does not cease within a short period of time at home, nasal packing and direct use of topical agents such as tranexamic acid-soaked gauze in an outpatient clinic or emergency room setting may help curtail bleeding but may also increase trauma to the nasal mucosa. Additional local measures that are commonly employed to control bleeding include laser treatments to the nasal mucosa and septodermoplasty. Historically, laser photocoagulation and other interventional procedures have been the cornerstone of therapy, although this may begin to shift with effective disease-modifying systemic therapeutics on the horizon, detailed later in this review. Nasal closureis an effective but extreme form of therapy that is rarely used.

### Epistaxis versus nonepistaxis bleeding in anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation: results from the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial [^112qy1VD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

The findings of this analysis have 2 broad implications. First, there is a need for increased attention to epistaxis in studies of antithrombotic therapies. This analysis suggests that these events, although less likely than bleeding at other anatomic sites to qualify as "major" according to adjudication criteria, recur in nearly 1 in 5 patients and appear to be quite important to patients with a significant impact on treatment adherence. Indeed, minor bleeding events have been previously shown to be associated with increased rates of oral anticoagulant discontinuation, bleeding is commonly given as the reason for discontinuing oral coagulation, and epistaxis itself has been previously shown to be a leading contributor to antiplatelet discontinuation.

Second, there is an opportunity for clinicians to educate patients on how to prevent and care for epistaxis, explain that epistaxis is rarely life threatening, and emphasize how interruption of anticoagulation therapy for patients with AF substantially increases risk of major cardiac and cerebrovascular events. As an example, one educational intervention at an academic medical center taught patients how to prevent epistaxis using moisturizing sprays and dehumidifiers, how to distinguish epistaxis that could likely be managed at home versus more severe epistaxis (persisting longer than 30 minutes, pouring down throat and nose, associated with high blood pressure, fast heart rate, chest pain, or lightheadedness), how to manage minor epistaxis at home (remain calm, lean forward, apply pressure, and consider use of oxymetazoline spray) and when to contact their anticoagulation provider. In a pre‐ and postimplementation analysis, the intervention was shown to reduce the risk of visiting the emergency department for epistaxis by 48% (risk ratio [RR], 0.52 [95% CI, 0.32–0.84]).

Introduction

Haemorrhage from the nose is formally referred to as "epistaxis". Haemostasis within the nose can be compromised by mucosal abnormalities, vessel pathology, or coagulation disorders. The aetiology of epistaxis is divided into groups: local and systemic factors. Local factors include the following: trauma, local inflammatory reactions, foreign bodies, postsurgical anatomical deformities, intranasal tumours, chemical inhalants, nasal-prong oxygen administration, and continuous positive airway pressure therapy for obstructive sleep apnoea. Systemic causes of epistaxis include the following: vascular disorders, especially hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT); blood dyscrasias; hematologic malignancies; and drugs affecting the normal clotting mechanism. Epistaxis arising from the anterior septal area (anterior epistaxis) is more common in children and young adults; it is the most common type of epistaxis and is more often venous in origin. This condition is usually responsive to treatment because it is readily accessible for nasal packing if bleeding does not resolve spontaneously. Therefore, endovascular therapy is usually not indicated for anterior epistaxis.

Approximately 5% of epistaxis episodes arise from the posterior and superior portions of the nasal cavity, and the majority of posterior epistaxis episodes arise from the arteries of the septum. Posterior epistaxis is more common in older patients than in children The most common factors associated with posterior epistaxis are hypertension, acetylsalicylic acid or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, previous episodes of epistaxis, alcohol use, and anticoagulant use. However, the majority of these cases are idiopathic. Refractory epistaxis is defined as recurrent or persistent bleeding after appropriate packing or multiple episodes of epistaxis during a short period of time, each requiring medical attention. Embolisation for intractable epistaxis was first reported as an alternative to surgery and other methods by Sokoloff.

Nasal endoscopy in recurrent epistaxis — indications and yield: Nasal endoscopy should be performed for those patients who have recurrent bleeding after initial control with cautery or nasal packing, and such recurrence of epistaxis is seen more commonly in those with bleeding from areas other than Kiesselbach's plexus and when the site was not located on initial evaluation; with nasal endoscopy, the bleeding site can be localized in 87% to 93% of cases, and posterior epistaxis can occur from the septum (70%) or the lateral nasal wall (24%), supporting targeted therapy; recurrent unilateral epistaxis with unilateral nasal obstruction should prompt evaluation with endoscopy of the nose and nasopharynx.

### Epistaxis versus nonepistaxis bleeding in anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation: results from the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial [^111WsGDQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Strengths and Novel Aspects of this Analysis

The strengths of this analysis include the systematic reporting of bleeding events, monitor oversight to minimize underreporting, and the blinded adjudication of events by an independent, centralized committee who were unaware of randomized treatment assignment. The ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48 trial was the largest and longest phase III trial comparing a DOAC with warfarin in patients with AF, following 21 105 participants over a median follow‐up of 2.8 years thus yielding a relatively large number of epistaxis events relative to prior studies. Additionally, the estimated time in therapeutic range for the warfarin group was 68.4%, which was the highest of any of the large DOAC versus warfarin trials and substantial greater than generally has been reported in clinical practice. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive analysis of a phase 3 trial of a DOAC to report the severity profile of epistaxis among patients, to compare the rates and severity of epistaxis between study arms, to report rates of drug discontinuation following epistaxis, and to describe the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and mortality following epistaxis.

Limitations

There are several important limitations to note. First, this was not a prespecified analysis and the trial was not powered to show treatment differences; therefore, the findings should be considered hypothesis‐generating. Second, a single event of epistaxis was sufficient to assign a participant to the epistaxis cohort, which does not account for the impact of nonepistaxis bleeding events on these participants' decision to discontinue their medication. However, only 7.6% of those who had any bleeding events had both epistaxis and nonepistaxis bleeding. Third, participants were categorized according to the severity of their most severe bleeding event within their cohort‐specific bleeding type. Finally, more granular data concerning the epistaxis events and treatment were not captured. Future studies could include the specific interventions performed, such as anterior versus posterior packing, electrical or chemical cautery, surgical intervention, arterial ligation or embolization, as well as the type and setting of care required for treatment to better characterize the nature and clinical consequences of the epistaxis events.

Interventions for nosebleed — initial measures and packing utilization: The majority of nosebleeds originate from the nasal septum, although the lateral nasal wall has a rich vascular supply as well. Initial ("first-line") treatment can include combinations of direct nasal compression, application of topical agents including vasoconstrictors, cautery of the bleeding site with chemicals or electrocautery, or packing with a variety of absorbable and nonabsorbable materials. In the NEDS review, 19.7% of emergency room visits for epistaxis involved treatment with nasal packing; among those requiring packing, Fifty-two percent also had nasal cautery; 41% had anterior packing alone; and 7% had anterior and posterior nasal packing performed.

### Is topical tranexamic acid effective in treating epistaxis? [^113omiyh]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

In 2021, Amini et al. conducted a prospective, double‐blind, parallel‐group, randomized clinical trial of 100 patients presenting with anterior epistaxis who take aspirin or clopidogrel. This study compared the use of topical TXA to phenylephrine‐lidocaine anterior nasal packing (PANP). The mean time to resolution of epistaxis was significantly lower in the TXA group compared to the PANP group (p = 0.002). Recurrent bleeding was also significantly lower in the TXA group compared to the PANP group (p = 0.03), and the TXA group had significantly less time spent in the ED (p < 0.001). The conclusion of this study suggests that topical TXA is an appropriate treatment option over PANP for bleeding cessation, reducing rebleeding, and minimizing duration of hospital stay in patients with anterior epistaxis who take antiplatelet medications. Of note, this study compared TXA to phenylephrine, which many centers have discontinued due to association with potential cardiovascular risks.

In 2022, Hosseinialhashemi et al. conducted a single‐center, double‐blind, randomized clinical trial of 240 patients referred to the "ENT ED" of a tertiary otolaryngology specialty hospital with spontaneous anterior epistaxis. The control group received cotton pledgets soaked in phenylephrine and lidocaine inserted into the nostrils for 15 min, and the intervention group received cotton pledgets soaked in TXA, lidocaine, and phenylephrine for 15 min. The primary outcome of interest was need for anterior packing. Secondary outcomes included prolonged time in the ED (over 2 h), requiring electrical cauterization, and rebleeding. Those in the intervention group were significantly less likely to require anterior nasal packing (50% vs. 64.2%) in comparison with the control group. The TXA group was associated with a shortened stay in the ED, and lower rates of rebleeding within 24 h. There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding need for cautery or rate of rebleeding within Days 1–7. Results from this study suggest that topical TXA may be associated with lower rate of anterior nasal packing and a shorter stay in the ED. This study focused on patients referred to a specialized Otolaryngology hospital, and as such, selection bias may have influenced the results.

Epistaxis guideline — endoscopic evaluation, targeted therapy, escalation, and follow-up: For recurrent nasal bleeding despite prior packing or cautery, or recurrent unilateral bleeding, clinicians should perform or refer for nasal endoscopy to identify the site and guide management. When a site is identified, clinicians should treat with appropriate interventions, which may include topical vasoconstrictors, nasal cautery, and moisturizing or lubricating agents, and if cautery is chosen they should anesthetize the site and restrict application only to the active or suspected site(s). For persistent or recurrent bleeding not controlled by packing or cauterization, clinicians should evaluate or refer for candidacy for surgical arterial ligation or endovascular embolization. In the absence of life-threatening bleeding in patients using anticoagulation/antiplatelet medications, clinicians should initiate first-line treatments prior to transfusion, reversal of anticoagulation, or withdrawal of these medications. Clinicians should assess or refer for assessment of nasal and/or oral mucosal telangiectasias in patients with recurrent bilateral nosebleeds or a relevant family history to diagnose hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome, should educate patients and caregivers on prevention, home treatment, and indications to seek care, and should document the outcome of intervention within 30 days or document transition of care after treatments such as nonresorbable packing, surgery, or arterial ligation/embolization.

Nasal packing: FAQs for patients with nosebleed — packing typically "should be in place for no longer than 5 days", and "if your packing is resorbable, it may not need removal and will go away with time and the use of nasal saline sprays". Bleeding can still occur with packing; "apply pressure to the nose with pinching of the soft area, call your clinician, or go to the emergency department for further management". For nonresorbable packing, using it past the recommended time "can result in possible complications", therefore "strict adherence to follow-up directions is important". Reported risks include infection and pressure-related injury: "There is a low risk of infection spreading to the nose and sinuses or, in extremely rare cases, throughout the body", and pressure "may decrease blood flow to areas of the nose and result in injury". To reduce complications, "oral antibiotics will be used if the risk for infection is high", and "keeping the nose and packing moist with nasal saline (salt water) sprays throughout the day can reduce crusting and help resorbable packing melt away"; "strict adherence to follow-up instructions will allow for appropriate removal of packing when necessary and should make complications less frequent". Activity and medication guidance includes: "you should avoid straining, lifting over 10 pounds, bending over, and exercising", and "avoid over-the-counter pain medications that may increase bleeding, including aspirin and ibuprofen"; "Acetaminophen (Tylenol) does not increase bleeding and can be used", and "you should not try to blow your nose… If you feel the need to sneeze, sneeze with mouth open". Seek care urgently if any warning signs occur: "return of blood from nose or mouth, fever over 101°F, increasing pain, vision changes, shortness of breath or labored breathing, loss of color around the skin of the nose, swelling of the face, or a diffuse skin rash". After removal, "you may initially experience a small amount of bleeding… Keeping the nose humid with saline spray and moisturizing agents will prevent dry crusts and facilitate healing"; if nosebleeds recur, "apply pressure… and consider the use of a vasoconstrictor spray", and "if bleeding continues, call your medical provider, or go to the emergency department for further management".

### Effectiveness of a nasal saline gel in the treatment of recurrent anterior epistaxis in anticoagulated patients [^117Rbd9f]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2011). Low credibility.

We believe that the use of cauterization in patients with anterior epistaxis in the absence of acute bleeding should be discouraged because it does not address the underlying cause and because it may even worsen the condition by extending the degree of mucosal disruption. This is especially true in patients who are receiving anticoagulation therapy. Therefore, we conducted a study to determine if the use of a nasal saline gel as monotherapy would be an effective alternative to invasive measures in treating recurrent epistaxis in anticoagulated patients. Our study group consisted of 74 patients-43 men and 31 women (mean age: 64.4 yr)-who had been seen in our department over an 18-month period and whose bleeding had originated in the anterior portion of the nasal vault. Most patients had been experiencing epistaxis for at least 6 months. Patients were given the saline nasal gel and taught to gently apply it to the mucosa of the anterior nasal vault with a cotton-tipped applicator at the first sign of recurrent bleeding. Patients were then followed up periodically over the next 3 months. Among the 74 patients, 69 (93.2%) had experienced a cessation of their epistaxis at 3 months. The results of our study suggest that this simple, painless technique has considerable value as a treatment option in this cohort of patients.

Epistaxis has been estimated to account for 0.5% of all emergency department visits and up to one-third of all otolaryngology-related emergency department encounters. Inpatient hospitalization for aggressive treatment of severe nosebleeds has been reported in 0.2% of patients with nosebleeds.

### Epistaxis: outpatient management | AAFP… [^116Ure5b]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Once airway patency has been determined, compressive therapy should be applied to stop bleeding in the anterior nasal plexus. Firm pressure is placed on the bilateral nostrils, below the nasal bones, for 10 to 15 minutes without interruption. Simple manual pinching may be used, or a nasal clip can be fashioned using tongue depressors taped together. To aid compressive therapy, direct spray of oxymetazoline or application of cotton soaked in oxymetazoline or epinephrine 1: 1, 000 may be useful to abate or slow the bleeding. 12, 13 Clinicians should be aware of the adverse effects of systemic epinephrine absorption, such as elevated blood pressure and tachycardia. 14 Electrical desiccation in the same pattern is also an effective way to control bleeding in the nares. 10 Blind cauterization is not recommended, because excessive destruction of the nasal mucosa with silver nitrate or electrical desiccation can lead to ulceration and septal perforation.

If compressive therapy is inadequate and directive therapy is ineffective or impossible because of continued brisk bleeding, topical therapy and nasal packing are the next options. Traditional nasal packing involves placing cotton stripping impregnated with petroleum jelly into the base of the nasal cavity, and layering until the nares are completely compressed. Nasal packing should be left in place for 48 hours. The use of oral and topical antibiotics in patients with nasal packing is common to prevent infectious complications such as staphylococcus-induced toxic shock syndrome and sinusitis, but there is little evidence to support antibiotic use. 16 Topical hemostatic agents such as Floseal and Surgicel may be effective for managing epistaxis, but are often unavailable in the outpatient setting.
14. POSTERIOR EPISTAXIS Posterior epistaxis is often brisk, and given the location of these vessels, it is usually difficult to visualize the site of bleeding.

Compared with anterior epistaxis, patients with posterior epistaxis are more likely to require hospitalization and are twice as likely to require nasal packing. 18, 19 Newer products that can adhere to an irregular moist surface, such as gelatin-thrombin matrix, 20 are still being tested, and there is no evidence to support their blind application. Posterior nasal packing may be attempted by a physician trained in this procedure. It is up to 70% effective at treating posterior epistaxis when performed by trained physicians.

### Epistaxis risk in patients treated with left atrial appendage occlusion versus oral anticoagulation [^116RKWgo]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anticoagulants (AC) are associated with epistaxis in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. Left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) is a treatment that allows AF patients to stop AC. The aim of this study is to evaluate the risk of developing epistaxis following LAAO versus direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) and warfarin.

Methods

This study uses the TriNetX database as well as institutional records. The TriNetX database was searched for AF patients on a DOAC, warfarin, or treated with LAAO. Epistaxis odds ratios were compared 1 day-6 months and 6 months-3years following initiation of DOAC, warfarin, or LAAO. Records of LAAO patients at our institution were also reviewed.

Results

The TriNetX query returned 1,185,862 patients. On TriNetX, LAAO patients had significantly higher odds of epistaxis likely due to antiplatelet therapy from 1day-6months compared to warfarin patients with DOAC patients (p < 0.0001). From 6 months-3years after treatment initiation, LAAO patients experience reduced odds of epistaxis and epistaxis requiring nasal packing compared to warfarin patients (OR: 0.69 p = 0.0003; OR: 0.58 p = 0.0043). Institutionally, epistaxis resolved in 66% (8/12) LAAO patients with a history of epistaxis with an average follow-up of 1.5years.

Discussion

LAAO decreased the frequency of epistaxis and epistaxis requiring nasal packing in AF patients on warfarin after 6months. Our institutional experience demonstrates long-term improvement in epistaxis after LAAO for DOAC and warfarin patients. Additional studies need to be performed to account for dual antiplatelet following LAAO on epistaxis risk.

Nosebleed (epistaxis) resorbable versus nonresorbable packing — definitions and indications — states that "Nasal packing materials can be divided into 2 types: resorbable and nonresorbable", and "in this guideline we use the term resorbable to refer to packing that does not require removal", whereas "All types of nonresorbable packing must be removed at some point after sustained control of nasal hemorrhage is achieved". "Nonresorbable packing includes a variety of gauze dressings, polymers, and inflatable balloons". In a "prospective randomized controlled trial" comparing polyvinyl acetate sponge and inflatable balloons with hydrocolloid fabric packs, "the latter produced significantly lower scores for subjective patient discomfort during insertion and removal". The text notes that with ongoing bleeding, packing "may slow or stop bleeding" and that "placement of any type of packing may reduce the need for more invasive and more costly therapies", and that "Resorbable nasal packing is usually recommended in cases of bleeding disorders, anticoagulation, or vascular abnormalities such as HHT".

### A retrospective review of spontaneous epistaxis outcomes for patients on novel oral anticoagulants compared to antiplatelets and warfarin [^112mdjiC]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims

The incidence of epistaxis-related admissions amongst elderly patients is rising due to the increasing use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents. This retrospective study evaluates the differences in outcomes for patients on warfarin, novel anticoagulants (NOACs) and antiplatelets over two different time periods.

Methodology

Retrospective case-control study with data from patients admitted with epistaxis through the Flinders Medical Centre Emergency Department in the first six months of 2013 and compared to the same period in 2018. The latter coincides with integration of NOACs into Australian prescribing practices. Included participants were ≥ 50 years with spontaneous epistaxis which coincides with peak incidence in adults. Exclusion criteria were epistaxis due to trauma, intrinsic coagulopathy, or recent post-surgery. Linear regression and binary logistic regression models were the statistical methods used.

Results

Data from 85 patients were analysed for length of stay (LOS), readmission rates and method of haemostasis. In 2013, 41 patients were included compared to 44 in 2018, suggesting a 7% increase in admissions rates but this was not statistically significant (p = 0.96). The proportion of patients admitted with epistaxis while taking an anticoagulant or antiplatelet agent increased from 66% in 2013 to 93% in 2018. Thirty six percent of patients in 2018 were taking NOACs, however, LOS was 2 times shorter (mean ratio = 2.08 days, 95% CI: 1.03, 4.19). Seven percent of patients in 2018 had bleeding requiring surgery or interventional radiology, compared to 12% in 2013, but this was not statistically significant. There was no statistically significant difference in readmission rates (p = 0.82) or intervention required (p = 0.74) between the two time periods.

Conclusions

Epistaxis admissions at our institution have increased since the introduction of NOACs. However, most patients can be managed successfully with intranasal packing and cautery alone. NOACs are not associated with increased rated of invasive haemostatic measures and patients have a shorter LOS.

Nasal packing is used to control bleeding in epistaxis and after endonasal surgery, for internal stabilization, and to prevent synechiae or restenosis, particularly after surgery. Generally accepted standards regarding the materials that should be used for packing, how long the packing should be left in place, or the indications for nasal packing are lacking. In view of the present lack of standardization and the many different packing materials used, we review the currently available materials and outline their respective properties, indications, and risks.

Embolisation is halted when the peripheral branches of the sphenopalatine segment are not opacified and the arterial tree seems to be debranched (Fig. 3 C). The amount of microparticles required varies. Special care must be taken as soon as the flow begins to slow because even small additional amounts of microparticles may result in unexpected arterial stasis or even reflux.

The strategy for embolisation in patients with idiopathic epistaxis relies on the identification of the side of bleeding and the collateral pathways involving the contralateral IMA and the ipsilateral facial artery (Fig. 2 C). The distribution of embolised arteries varies significantly in published series. The bilateral IMAs together with the ipsilateral facial artery were embolised in 27–48%, the bilateral IMAs in 15–35%, and the unilateral IMA in 13–70% of cases. The bilateral IMAs are embolised if the side of haemorrhage is unknown or bilateral IMAs and ipsilateral facial artery if the side of haemorrhage is known. There also exist published case reports describing embolisation of the ascending pharyngeal and accessory meningeal supply to the nasal fossa for the management of epistaxis.

Nasal Packing Removal

Two different strategies regarding nasal packing removal have been reported in the literature. Some operators remove the packs while the catheters are still in the arteries, check the nasal pathway for bleeding, and finish the procedure if the nasal pathway remains dry for 15 min. Persistent bleeding influences the decision to embolise the contralateral IMA or the ipsilateral facial artery. Other practitioners leave the packs in place to facilitate the synergistic effects of external compression and devascularisation. Nasal packing removal is influenced by the duration of its placement, the severity and intractability of the epistaxis, and occasionally by the time of day the procedure is performed. Care must be taken to prevent the aspiration of pooled blood into the respiratory tract.

Recommendation-specific supportive text for epistaxis — Technique emphasizes sustained pressure and positioning: "The treatment of nosebleeds (epistaxis) involves having the person sit down and continuously hold the lower third or soft portion of the nose pinched closed to help the blood clot". "Leaning forward stops blood from entering the airway (which can cause trouble breathing) or the stomach (which can cause vomiting)". "The bleeding person should be instructed to breathe through their mouth and spit out any blood". Effectiveness and potential complications are noted: "Nasal pressure alone is the only intervention required in the vast majority of cases, including 20% of cases managed in EDs". and "Ongoing epistaxis can lead to anemia and shock due to blood loss". Trauma considerations are highlighted: "Traumatic epistaxis is a form of craniofacial trauma and may be associated with traumatic brain injury and facial bone fractures". and "Signs of traumatic brain injury, including loss of consciousness, altered mental status, repeated vomiting, change in vision, difficulty moving or walking, or severe headache, indicate the potential for a medical emergency requiring activation of the emergency response system". Medication-related risk is described: "Patients taking either anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy, including aspirin, are at increased risk of severe epistaxis and hospital admission compared with patients not on these medications, and often have multiple comorbidities". and "Nosebleed in these patients is more likely to require intervention from a health care professional than those not taking anticoagulant medication".

Several studies suggest that use of systemic antibiotics following nasal packing should not be mandatory; although the 1 available systematic review did not show a significant benefit to the use of antibiotics with nasal packing, the individual studies were underpowered, so the risks and benefits should be evaluated in each patient. Reported complications include airway obstruction if packs are malpositioned or become dislodged, synechiae with long-term nasal obstruction, and nasal septal perforation with bilateral nasal packings.

Epistaxis — clinical setting and procedure for nasal packing specifies that anterior nasal packing can be performed by nonspecialist clinicians in the outpatient office or emergency department with resources to perform anterior rhinoscopy, ideally including illumination and specula, suction to clear blood and clot, and forceps placement with lubrication such as antibiotic ointments; patients with resorbable packing are often managed as outpatients, and uncomplicated anterior epistaxis controlled with packing can usually be managed safely as outpatients even after nonresorbable packing, whereas severe nosebleeds requiring posterior packing are usually managed in an emergency department or hospital and the care of most patients who require posterior packing should involve an otolaryngology consultant, with patients potentially requiring intensive cardiopulmonary monitoring due to reported major cardiopulmonary complications and a debated "nasopulmonary reflex".

Regarding medical management for epistaxis, more specifically with respect to general principles, AAO-HNS 2020 guidelines recommend to treat patients with an identified site of bleeding with an appropriate intervention, which may include ≥ 1 of the following:

- moisturizing or lubricating agents

- topical vasoconstrictors

- nasal cautery.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^112S85kN]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Epistaxis — supporting data for advanced interventions: Although many cases of epistaxis will resolve with conservative management, approximately 6% of patients will require management more invasive than cautery or packing for recurrent and/or intractable epistaxis. Historically, prolonged posterior nasal packing (2–7 days) had mediocre hemostasis with recurrent bleeding in up to 52% of cases and was associated with prolonged hospitalization and significant discomfort. Transnasal endoscopic sphenopalatine artery ligation (TESPAL) is now the most commonly employed surgical arterial ligation technique with a reported success rate of up to 98%, and complication rates with TESPAL are relatively low, including postoperative hemorrhage (3.4%), with a similar reported mortality rate as compared with embolization; recent treatment algorithms employ surgical arterial ligation and/or endovascular embolization as second-line therapies for recurrent and/or intractable epistaxis.

Epistaxis — resorbable versus nonresorbable anterior packing outcomes indicate that resorbable hemostatic gelatin thrombin matrices may offer advantages: a randomized controlled trial of 70 patients comparing hemostatic gelatin thrombin with polyvinyl acetate sponge packs found the hemostatic gelatin thrombin packs were judged more effective and easier to use, and placement had decreased pain compared with polyvinyl acetate sponges; use of resorbable packing should also be considered in young children where removal of a nonresorbable pack can be challenging.

### Management of epistaxis in children and adolescents: avoiding a chaotic approach [^111ABN8s]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

This article provides an organized foundation that facilitates the management of acute epistaxis and an understanding of features that merit further diagnostic workup. Prompt management, including measures such as holding pressure and using nasal packing, takes precedence over comprehensive diagnostic workup. Severe, recurrent, and posteriorly based bleeds should prompt consideration of alternate interventions and expert consultation.

### Nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant activity: challenges in measurement and reversal [^112ih2LX]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Reversal of NOACs is only necessary in cases of life-threatening bleeding or emergency surgery. In instances of minor bleeding, symptomatic management, such as nasal packing in the case of epistaxis, has been suggested for patients receiving NOACs. If necessary, delaying the next dose of anticoagulant or temporarily discontinuing treatment — as the NOACs have relatively short half-lives — may be sufficient. Administering activated charcoal to reduce NOAC absorption has also been suggested. In instances of moderate or severe bleeding, recommendations are primarily supportive and are similar to those given for VKA-related bleeds; hemodynamic support to maintain blood pressure, renal perfusion, and urine output should be provided. Maintenance of hemodynamic support and renal perfusion is important as 80% of the clearance of an absorbed dabigatran dose and 66, 50, and 27% of the total clearance of rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and apixaban, respectively, is via the kidneys. In the event of moderate-to-severe bleeding, the European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend mechanical compression and volume replacement when appropriate. Fresh frozen plasma, platelets, red blood cells, and cryoprecipitate (or fibrinogen concentrates if cryoprecipitate is not available) are important for hemostatic and hemodynamic resuscitation. Notably, the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) does not recommend fresh frozen plasma in patients with life-threatening NOAC-related bleeding and instead suggests PCCs or factor VIII inhibitor bypassing agent (FEIBA, Baxter, Westlake Village, CA, USA), if available. However, if the patient is actively hemorrhaging, then a massive transfusion protocol should be considered and instituted.

### Tranexamic acid for patients with nasal haemorrhage (epistaxis) [^114U6g8E]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Epistaxis (nosebleed) most commonly affects children and the elderly. The majority of episodes are managed at home with simple measures. In more severe cases medical intervention is required to either cauterise the bleeding vessel, or to pack the nose with various materials. Tranexamic acid is used in a number of clinical settings to stop bleeding by preventing clot breakdown (fibrinolysis). It may have a role in the management of epistaxis as an adjunct to standard treatments, reducing the need for further intervention.

Objectives

To determine the effects of tranexamic acid (oral, intravenous or topical) compared with placebo, no additional intervention or any other haemostatic agent in the management of patients with epistaxis.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register (via CRS Web); Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (via CRS Web); PubMed; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 29 October 2018.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of tranexamic acid (in addition to usual care) compared with usual care plus placebo, usual care alone or usual care plus any other haemostatic agent, to control epistaxis in adults or children.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcomes were control of epistaxis: re-bleeding (as measured by the proportion of patients re-bleeding within a period of up to 10 days) and significant adverse effects (seizures, thromboembolic events). Secondary outcomes were control of epistaxis as measured by the time to stop initial bleeding (the proportion of patients whose bleeding is controlled within a period of up to 30 minutes); severity of re-bleeding (as measured by (a) the proportion of patients requiring any further intervention and (b) the proportion of patients requiring blood transfusion); length of hospital stay and other adverse effects. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.

Main Results

We included six RCTs (692 participants). The overall risk of bias in the studies was low. Two studies assessed oral administration of tranexamic acid, given regularly over several days, and compared it to placebo. In the other four studies, a single application of topical tranexamic acid was compared with placebo (one study) and a combination of epinephrine and lidocaine or phenylephrine (three studies). All participants were adults. Tranexamic acid versus placeboFor our primary outcome, control of epistaxis: re-bleeding (proportion re-bleeding within 10 days), we were able to pool data from three studies. The pooled result demonstrated a benefit of tranexamic acid compared to placebo, the risk of re-bleeding reducing from 67% to 47% (risk ratio (RR) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56 to 0.90; three studies; 225 participants; moderate-quality evidence). When we compared the effects of oral and topical tranexamic acid separately the risk of re-bleeding with oral tranexamic acid reduced from 69% to 49%, RR 0.73 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.96; two studies, 157 participants; moderate-quality evidence) and with topical tranexamic acid it reduced from 66% to 43%, RR 0.66 (95% CI 0.41 to 1.05; single study, 68 participants). We rated the quality of evidence provided by the single study as low, therefore it is uncertain whether topical tranexamic acid is effective in stopping bleeding in the 10-day period after a single application. No study specifically sought to identify and report our primary outcome: significant adverse effects (i.e. seizures, thromboembolic events). The secondary outcome time to stop initial bleeding (proportion with bleeding controlled within 30 minutes) was measured in one study using topical tranexamic acid and there was no evidence of a difference at 30 minutes (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.11; 68 participants; low-quality evidence). No studies reported the proportion of patients requiring any further intervention (e.g. repacking, surgery, embolisation). One study of oral tranexamic acid reported the proportion of patients requiring blood transfusion and found no difference between groups: 5/45 (11%) versus 6/44 (14%) (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.48; 89 participants; low-quality evidence). Two studies reported hospital length of stay. One study reported a significantly shorter stay in the oral tranexamic acid group (mean difference (MD) -1.60 days, 95% CI -2.49 to -0.71; 68 participants). The other study found no evidence of a difference between the groups. Tranexamic acid versus other haemostatic agentsWhen we pooled the data from three studies the proportion of patients whose bleeding stopped within 10 minutes was significantly higher in the topical tranexamic acid group compared to the group receiving another haemostatic agent (70% versus 30%: RR 2.35, 95% CI 1.90 to 2.92; 460 participants) (moderate-quality evidence). Adverse effects across all studiesFive studies recorded 'adverse effects' in a general way. None found any difference between the groups in the occurrence of minor adverse effects (e.g. mild nausea and diarrhoea, 'bad taste' of gel). In one study a patient developed a superficial thrombophlebitis of both legs following discharge, however it is not reported in which group this occurred. No "other serious adverse effect" was reported in any study.

Authors' Conclusions

We found moderate-quality evidence that there is probably a reduction in the risk of re-bleeding with the use of either oral or topical tranexamic acid in addition to usual care in adult patients with epistaxis, compared to placebo with usual care. However, the quality of evidence relating solely to topical tranexamic acid was low (one study only), so we are uncertain whether or not topical tranexamic acid is effective in stopping bleeding in the 10-day period after a single application. We found moderate-quality evidence that topical tranexamic acid is probably better than other topical agents in stopping bleeding in the first 10 minutes. There have been only three RCTs on this subject since 1995. Since then there have been significant changes in nasal cauterisation and packing techniques (for example, techniques including nasal endoscopy and more invasive approaches such as endoscopic sphenopalatine artery ligation). New trials would inform us about the effectiveness of tranexamic acid in light of these developments.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^112eE697]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Clinical practice guideline — epistaxis with anticoagulant/antiplatelet medications action statement profile — Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C with a high level of confidence; the policy level is a recommendation based on a preponderance of benefit over harm. Benefits are stated as "Control nosebleeds without increasing thrombotic risk… reduce blood product exposure, decrease cost… ", whereas risks include "Persistence or recurrence of nosebleeds, delay in treatment". Value judgments note that "clinicians are willing to risk prolonging the time to resolution of nasal bleeding" to avoid thrombotic and blood-product risks; intentional vagueness uses the term "life-threatening", patient preferences are moderate, and exclusions and differences of opinion are none.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^114vn9eq]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Epistaxis — prompt management (Statement 1) directs that at the time of initial contact, the clinician should distinguish the nosebleed patient who requires prompt management from the patient who does not, and this is a Recommendation based on observational studies and a preponderance of benefit over harm. The quality improvement opportunity is to identify those patients who need immediate diagnosis and treatment, with aggregate evidence quality Grade C, a Level of confidence in evidence: Medium, and policy level Recommendation. Benefits include prevention of morbidity and in rare cases mortality, increased likelihood of timely treatment, more efficient allocation of resources to patients in greatest need of treatment, reduction of patient and family stress, and avoidance of unnecessary interventions in patients who are not actively bleeding, while risks and harms include delayed treatment of patients who may actually need intervention, overtreatment of patients who are not actively bleeding, and increased patient anxiety; no costs are associated with this recommendation, and the benefit-harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm. Intentional vagueness is noted in that the actual appropriate timing for "prompt" management is not specified and assessment of bleeding severity may occur during telephone/electronic communications or during face-to-face patient encounter, and the purpose is to assist clinicians in determining the severity of a nosebleed as well as the appropriate clinical setting where the patient should be seen for management.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^117SJKCb]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Supporting text — post-treatment follow-up for epistaxis emphasizes outcome tracking and specific revisit criteria: The purpose of this statement is to assist clinicians in evaluating and documenting 30-day outcomes after treatment for epistaxis, and documenting transition of care to another qualified clinician in the electronic medical record is sufficient to meet this recommendation. Clinicians should evaluate patients following treatment for epistaxis if (1) bleeding has not resolved, (2) invasive treatments were performed, or (3) additional evaluation and testing suggest a potential underlying condition that predisposes to more nosebleeds. Recurrence rates vary by technique and patient factors, ranging from an estimated < 10% after surgical artery ligation or arterial embolization to as much as a 50% recurrence for nasal packing, and many treated patients become lost to follow-up over time, complicating assessment of persistent or recurrent bleeding.

### Epistaxis [^115fCA3f]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Epistaxis is a common occurrence. The estimated lifetime incidence of epistaxis is approximately 60% and it ranges in severity from a minor nuisance to a life-threatening hemorrhage. Evaluation of recurrent or severe cases includes a search for underlying causes, such as bleeding disorders and neoplasia. Many techniques, materials, and procedures treat nasal bleeding effectively and sometimes more than one treatment must be used. Otolaryngologists must be prepared to deal with severe or refractory bleeding through the use of medications, packing materials, and radiologic or surgical interventions. This article reviews nasal vascular anatomy, common causes of epistaxis, and treatments, including biomaterials and minimally invasive surgical techniques.

### Demographic differences in emergency room epistaxis treatment patterns and outcomes [^115WYZnQ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

The data used in this study was collected between December 2023 and January 2024 from the TriNetX US Collaborative Network, which provided access to facility based electronic medical record data (diagnoses, procedures, medications, laboratory values, genomic information) of 105,697,929 patients from 61 health care organizations from the past 20 years across the United States. The institutional review board of the University of Southern California determined this study to be exempt as deidentified population level data was collected. All International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD‐10) and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes utilized are listed in Supplemental Table S1, available online.

Patients 18 years of age or older who presented to the ED with a diagnosis of epistaxis were included in this study. Patients with a history of Factor VIII deficiency, Factor IX deficiency, or other coagulation defects were excluded. Patients with a documented procedure of the nose or accessory sinuses within a month prior to the visit were similarly excluded. Demographic data including primary language, race, and ethnicity were collected. Language was stratified by English‐speaking, Spanish‐speaking, and other language‐speaking. Race was stratified by White, Black, Asian, and other race. Ethnicity was stratified by Hispanic or Latino and non‐Hispanic or Latino. Cohorts were then compared to English‐speaking, White race, and non‐Hispanic or Latino ethnicity patients by their respective variables. Patients were 1:1 propensity score matched by age, sex, primary hypertension, secondary hypertension, alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver, other and unspecified cirrhosis of the liver, anticoagulant use, and history of malignancy (Table 1). The propensity score matching was performed using the TriNetX built‐in analysis platform (1:1 matching by nearest‐neighbor greedy matching algorithm). Propensity score matching can effectively reduce bias in estimating treatment effects and decrease confounding variables when analyzing nonrandomized, observational data.

Table 1
Baseline Demographic Characteristics

We evaluated the risk for receiving nasal decongestant sprays, epistaxis control procedures (including nasal packing or cautery, tranexamic acid, and endoscopic control of hemorrhage), diagnostic nasal endoscopy, hospital admission, and mortality. Frequency of ED visits were also evaluated. Nasal packing or cautery was further stratified by anatomic location into anterior or posterior. Previous literature utilizing CPT codes were used to inform the codes chosen. Outcomes in each cohort were retrospectively monitored from the day of ED visit for 7 days. Measures of association and cohort statistics were performed.

### Is topical tranexamic acid effective in treating epistaxis? [^114tLqKV]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

Epistaxis is a common emergency department (ED) presentation. Many cases are self‐limited, but other cases may require an intervention to stop bleeding. Methods to manage epistaxis include nasal compression, topical vasoconstrictors, cautery, nasal packing, and even surgical ligation in severe cases.

Though generally effective, nasal packing is associated with complications such as pain, mucosal irritation, rebleeding with pack removal, infection, and tissue necrosis. As a result, the search for alternative methods to treat epistaxis continues. Tranexamic acid (TXA), a well‐known antifibrinolytic agent, is used commonly in the emergency room in the setting of trauma and has been used in the operating room to reduce bleeding. It has recently gained popularity as a treatment modality for epistaxis. The goal of this review is to determine whether topical TXA is an effective treatment modality for epistaxis.

### Comparative effectiveness of various noninvasive local treatments in patients with epistaxis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112TQfSa]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The best initial strategy for managing epistaxis is unclear. We performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare the effectiveness of various noninvasive treatments for patients with epistaxis.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception to September 2022 without language restrictions. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing immediate hemostasis, 2-day and 7-day rebleeding outcomes, as well as the use of noninvasive interventions for the treatment of epistaxis were selected. Frequentist NMA was performed.

Results

The systematic review included 20 RCTs (2994 participants) involving 12 different interventions. The NMA demonstrated that topical treatment with tranexamic acid (TXA) significantly reduced the odds of 2-day rebleeding compared with the control conservative treatment (odds ratio [OR] 0.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.21–0.61) and traditional anterior nasal packing (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26–0.76). The sensitivity analysis yielded robust results, and the overall evidence was high. Topical TXA significantly reduced the odds of 7-day rebleeding compared with traditional nasal packing (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.15–0.70), with moderate evidence owing to the heterogeneous results. Despite the significant effects of topical TXA on achieving immediate hemostasis and Rapid Rhino nasal packing on preventing 2-day rebleeding compared to the control and traditional nasal packing, the evidence is low to very low due to heterogeneity, inconsistency, and within-study bias.

Conclusions

In the treatment of epistaxis, topical TXA may be superior to conservative treatment or traditional nasal packing, particularly in preventing 2-day rebleeding.
