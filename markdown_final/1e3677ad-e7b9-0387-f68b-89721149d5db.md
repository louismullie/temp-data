## Question

What is genetic test for bullous Penphigoid

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what genetic test exists for bullous pemphigoid and how to interpret its role in diagnosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether bullous pemphigoid is a genetic disease that warrants routine genetic testing. Then, I should verify what the standard diagnostic tests are and how reliable they are. Next, I will examine the evidence for genetic susceptibility and whether any validated genetic test is used clinically. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation and clarify when, if ever, genetic testing might be considered in research or special contexts.

> Let me first confirm the disease mechanism. Bullous pemphigoid is an acquired autoimmune blistering disease caused by autoantibodies against hemidesmosomal proteins BP180 and BP230, leading to subepidermal blisters. It is not a monogenic inherited disorder, so there is no routine clinical genetic test for diagnosis of BP itself [^288636cf] [^0a291f12].

> Wait, let me verify the standard diagnostic approach. The diagnosis relies on clinical features plus immunopathology: direct immunofluorescence on perilesional skin showing linear IgG and/or C3 at the basement membrane zone, and indirect immunofluorescence on salt-split skin demonstrating IgG on the epidermal side. ELISA for anti-BP180 and anti-BP230 supports the diagnosis and helps monitor disease activity, with anti-BP180 correlating more strongly with severity than anti-BP230 [^3fe25d7e] [^05dc959f] [^618b1a3a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about genetics. I need to check whether any genetic testing is used clinically. The evidence shows genetic susceptibility at the HLA locus, particularly HLA-DQ and HLA-DR alleles, and some non-HLA associations have been explored, but these are research findings and are not used as diagnostic tests in routine care. No guideline or review endorses a clinical genetic test for BP diagnosis [^d7fb48bd] [^592c15ab] [^a5f072f8].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered if COL17A1 genetic testing might be relevant because BP autoantibodies target BP180/COL17A1. But I should double-check that distinction. COL17A1 mutations cause junctional epidermolysis bullosa, a heritable mechanobullous disorder, which is a different disease entity from autoimmune BP; testing COL17A1 is appropriate for suspected EB, not for diagnosing BP, so I need to correct that line of thought and keep them separate [^ebba6fda] [^46788ca7].

> Next, I should review whether any special scenarios justify genetic testing in BP. Research studies have used genome-wide approaches to identify susceptibility loci, and Mendelian randomization has been used to explore causal relationships, but these are investigational and do not translate into a clinical genetic diagnostic assay for BP. Likewise, drug-induced BP phenotypes have been linked to HLA variants, yet this remains research-level rather than a routine clinical test [^d2dd0ce8] [^a5f072f8].

> I will now examine the bottom line and make sure I'm precise. There is no validated or recommended genetic test for diagnosing bullous pemphigoid. Diagnosis remains clinical plus immunofluorescence and serology, with ELISA for BP180/BP230 aiding confirmation and follow-up. Genetic testing is not indicated for BP itself, though it plays a central role in inherited blistering diseases like epidermolysis bullosa, which can be confused clinically but are pathobiologically distinct [^3fe25d7e] [^05dc959f] [^ebba6fda].

> Final answer: There is no clinical genetic test for bullous pemphigoid. Diagnosis is established by direct immunofluorescence, indirect immunofluorescence on salt-split skin, and ELISA for anti-BP180 and anti-BP230. Genetic testing is not used for BP diagnosis, although HLA associations have been described in research settings [^3fe25d7e] [^05dc959f] [^d7fb48bd].

---

There is **no routine genetic test** for bullous pemphigoid (BP). BP is an autoimmune disease diagnosed by clinical features plus direct immunofluorescence (DIF) [^3fe25d7e], indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) on salt-split skin [^3fe25d7e], and ELISA for anti-BP180/230 [^05dc959f]. While HLA associations (e.g. HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1) [^592c15ab] [^a5f072f8] confer susceptibility, genetic testing is not used clinically for diagnosis or management. Genetic testing is reserved for research or when hereditary blistering disorders (e.g. epidermolysis bullosa) are suspected [^ebba6fda].

---

## Current diagnostic standards for bullous pemphigoid

The diagnosis of BP relies on a **combination of clinical assessment, histopathology, and immunological testing** [^0a291f12]:

- **Clinical assessment**: Characterized by tense bullae on erythematous or normal skin, often accompanied by pruritus, and predominantly affecting elderly patients [^288636cf].

- **Histopathology**: Subepidermal blisters with eosinophilic infiltration are typical findings on skin biopsy [^b3fba6be].

- **Direct immunofluorescence (DIF)**: Linear deposition of IgG and/or C3 along the basement membrane zone is considered the gold standard for BP diagnosis [^3fe25d7e].

- **Indirect immunofluorescence (IIF)**: Detection of circulating autoantibodies against BP180 and BP230 using salt-split human skin substrate is highly specific and complements DIF [^3fe25d7e].

- **Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)**: Quantitative detection of anti-BP180 and anti-BP230 antibodies provides additional diagnostic support and aids in monitoring disease activity [^618b1a3a].

---

## Genetic predisposition and susceptibility

Although BP is primarily an autoimmune disease, **genetic factors influence susceptibility** [^d7fb48bd]. Studies have identified associations between BP and specific HLA alleles, particularly within the HLA class II region [^592c15ab]. For example, HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 alleles have been implicated in increased susceptibility to BP in various populations [^a5f072f8]. However, these genetic associations are not sufficiently specific or sensitive to be used as standalone diagnostic tools.

---

## Limitations of genetic testing in bullous pemphigoid

Genetic testing for BP faces several **significant limitations**:

- **Lack of specific genetic markers**: Unlike monogenic disorders, BP does not have a single or a few specific genetic mutations that can reliably diagnose the disease [^d7fb48bd].

- **Complex genetic architecture**: The genetic predisposition to BP involves multiple genes and polymorphisms, each contributing modestly to overall susceptibility, making it challenging to develop a comprehensive genetic test [^d7fb48bd].

- **Environmental factors**: The development of BP is strongly influenced by environmental triggers, such as medications, infections, and physical trauma, which further complicate the predictive value of genetic testing [^69a40aa3].

---

## Current research and future directions

Ongoing research efforts focus on identifying additional genetic susceptibility loci and understanding the **interaction between genetic and environmental factors** in BP pathogenesis [^d7fb48bd]. Advances in genomic technologies, such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and next-generation sequencing (NGS), may uncover novel genetic variants associated with BP. However, these findings are currently limited to research settings and have not translated into routine clinical practice.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the use of DIF, IIF, and ELISA as the **standard diagnostic approach** for BP [^3fe25d7e]. Genetic testing is not recommended for routine diagnosis or management of BP. It may be considered in research settings or when investigating hereditary blistering disorders, such as epidermolysis bullosa, which have distinct genetic etiologies and clinical presentations [^ebba6fda].

---

## Conclusion

There is **no established genetic test** for diagnosing bullous pemphigoid. The diagnosis relies on clinical evaluation, histopathology, and immunological assays, including direct and indirect immunofluorescence and ELISA. While genetic factors contribute to susceptibility, they are not sufficiently specific or sensitive for clinical diagnostic purposes. Genetic testing may be considered in research settings or when hereditary blistering disorders are suspected, but it is not part of routine clinical practice for BP.

### Bullous pemphigoid [^288636cf]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2025). High credibility.

Bullous pemphigoid is a chronic, subepidermal autoimmune blistering disease characterized by tense blisters on erythematous or normal skin that predominantly affects the older population. The disease arises from autoantibodies targeting hemidesmosomal proteins BP180 and BP230, which are crucial for dermal-epidermal adhesion. The incidence of bullous pemphigoid is increasing, attributed to an ageing population and improved diagnostic recognition. Genetic predisposition, environmental triggers and associations with other autoimmune disorders underline its multifactorial nature. Diagnosis involves clinical presentation, histopathology, direct immunofluorescence and serological tests. Treatment aims to reduce symptoms and prevent new blister formation, using corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents and biologics such as rituximab and omalizumab. Despite therapeutic advancements, challenges persist in long-term management, especially in older patients with comorbidities. Ongoing research into molecular mechanisms and novel therapeutic targets and clinical trials are crucial for the development of safer and more effective treatments.

Simple descriptive population data are potentially helpful in understanding how bullous pemphigoid (BP) originates and evolves over time. Before embarking with etiological correlations, artifacts and biases should be ruled out. Ideally, epidemiological data should be complemented by immunological and genetic analyses aimed at providing better insight into the causation and prognosis of BP.

7.1.3 Carrier testing

✓ The biological parents of a patient with EB, as well as biological siblings, can be referred to a diagnostic centre to test for carrier status when the genetic sequence variant has been confirmed in the index case (according to good clinical practice guidelines for genetic counselling). Under the dominant condition of the disease, this can act as a 'sequence variant confirmation'. The segregation of pathogenic variant(s) in the parents and other family members is important in understanding the inheritance pattern (autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, de novo) and the risk assessment for future pregnancies. Carrier screening for a person who is not connected to the patient through blood, or who is not from the same geographical area, can be recommended. 17 According to the individual situation and national regulations, genetic testing of the partner should be performed after genetic counselling. Recurrence of the disease in the family is possible, even if the calculated risk is very low. 18

7.1.4 Prenatal diagnosis

✓ When the carrier status of the familial sequence variant has been determined in both parties of an expecting couple, DNA‐based prenatal testing can be offered to the couple upon their request. Some countries may have their specific local regulations and ethical requirements, which need to be considered before a PND can take place. According to the national regulations, the test can be referred by a genetics counsellor (preferably with knowledge of EB) or a dermatologist specialized in EB. Referral for prenatal testing by linkage analysis would need to be discussed in detail with professionals in a genetic diagnostic centre, as such a situation usually requires substantial tests and knowledge of the index case.

7.2 Epidermolysis bullosa laboratory diagnostic flowchart

In cases with skin fragility and blistering, standard histopathological evaluation and direct immunofluorescence of skin samples, microbiological swabs and indirect immunofluorescence with patient's serum (and any other laboratory test required) are routinely indicated to rule out differential diagnoses of EB, such as infections (e.g. staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, candidiasis, herpes simplex), autoimmune blistering disorders (e.g. bullous pemphigoid), mastocytosis or other genodermatoses (e.g. epidermolytic ichthyosis).

If the clinical features and family history are suggestive of EB, laboratory diagnosis is always indicated, after informed consent is given by the patient, parents or caregivers (Fig. 2).

### Genetic predisposition to bullous pemphigoid [^d7fb48bd]. Journal of Dermatological Science (2020). Medium credibility.

Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a common autoimmune blistering skin disease that mainly affects elderly patients. Although BP risk is strongly influenced by age, genetic factors are also important determinants of this disease. Many genomic regions, especially in the HLA-II region, have been found to influence BP susceptibility through targeted sequencing studies. However, the relationship between non-HLA regions and BP susceptibility remains poorly understood and the identification of functional variants and key genes within these association regions remains a major challenge. In this review, we summarize the genetic predisposition to BP through an overview of the research history in this field.

### Drug-induced pemphigus [^64c89fe7]. Clinics in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Pemphigus is an autoimmune bullous disease that may be influenced by genetic and exogenous factors. Drugs are a leading cause of pemphigus. There is a need for a thorough history taking so as to find the culprit medication. The diagnosis of drug-induced pemphigus is challenging. Patients have often been exposed to multiple drugs, and some drugs may have a prolonged latency period between exposure and onset of the disease. The in vitro interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) release from lymphocytes test has been shown to be of diagnostic value in drug-induced skin reactions. Cessation of the offending drug may alleviate the clinical manifestations and reduce the need for medical treatment.

### Pemphigoid diseases [^0a291f12]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Pemphigoid diseases are a group of well defined autoimmune disorders that are characterised by autoantibodies against structural proteins of the dermal-epidermal junction and, clinically, by tense blisters and erosions on skin or mucous membranes close to the skin surface. The most common of these diseases is bullous pemphigoid, which mainly affects older people and the reported incidence of which in Europe has more than doubled in the past decade. Prognosis and treatments vary substantially between the different disorders and, since clinical criteria are usually not sufficient, direct immunofluorescence microscopy of a perilesional biopsy specimen or serological tests are needed for exact diagnosis. In eight pemphigoid diseases the target antigens have been identified molecularly, which has allowed the development of standard diagnostic assays for detection of serum autoantibodies-some of which are commercially available. In this Seminar we discuss the clinical range, diagnostic criteria, diagnostic assay systems, and treatment options for this group of diseases.

### The genetics of pemphigus [^3e34f5ec]. Dermatologic Clinics (2011). Low credibility.

Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is an autoimmune blistering disorder with a complex etiology involving an interplay of genetic as well as environmental factors, most of which remain unknown. Despite the identification of several human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles as risk factors for disease, no other non-HLA genes have clearly been implicated in disease susceptibility. Newer candidate gene and whole-genome approaches are needed to illuminate the full palate of genetic risk elements in PV. Based on this information, genetic-based tools can be expected to provide a scientific rationale for future clinical decision-making by physicians and facilitate an era of personalized medicine.

1 Purpose and scope

The overall objective of this guideline is to provide the user with information on the laboratory diagnosis of inherited epidermolysis bullosa (EB) to improve outcomes (Table 1). An accurate diagnosis and subclassification of EB enables (i) early prognostication of disease severity, (ii) decision making for patient management, (iii) informed genetic counselling for the patient and family and DNA‐based prenatal or preimplantation genetic diagnosis, (iv) long‐term surveillance and management of possible complications, (v) inclusion in clinical trials and (vi) precision medicine.

Table 1
Summary of key recommendations for laboratory diagnosis of epidermolysis bullosa (EB)

Users of the guideline will be dermatologists, neonatologists, paediatricians, geneticists and genetic counsellors, laboratory doctors and technicians, nurses, and people living with EB and their families. The target group consists of patients with skin blistering or fragility, suspected of having any type of EB.

### Molecular testing in epidermolysis bullosa [^c67df5bf]. Dermatologic Clinics (2010). Low credibility.

The development of DNA technology and improved knowledge of the structure and function of the human genome have led to the identification of the causative genes responsible for the different forms of epidermolysis bullosa (EB) and provided the opportunity to determine the precise location and type of mutations present in EB patients, allowing diagnosis of this disease at the level of the defective gene itself. The large genetic heterogeneity of EB, however, precludes the direct use of molecular testing for EB diagnosis. In addition, only a few diagnostic or research laboratories in the world are equipped to perform mutational screening, which is still labor intensive and associated with considerable costs, because most mutations are unique to one or a few families. This article reviews the most popular methods used in EB molecular analysis.

### Autoimmune bullous dermatoses: a review… [^b3fba6be]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Biopsy of the margin of a bulla, when examined by light microscopy, will reveal a suprabasilar blister with acantholysis. The acantholysis is caused by a loss of cohesion between cells in the lower epidermis, resulting in the formation of a blister just above the basal cell layer. Early pemphigus vulgaris lesions may show eosinophilic spongiosis as well. Intercellular deposits of IgG and C3 are the defining signs of pemphigus vulgaris. Thus, there is intercellular staining throughout the epidermis on direct immunofluorescence. On histopathologic examination, paraneoplastic pemphigus appears to be a combination of pemphigus vulgaris and erythema multiforme. There is suprabasilar acantholysis as seen in pemphigus vulgaris, as well as basal cell vacuolation, lymphocytic exocytosis, and dyskeratotic keratinocytes typical of erythema multiforme. In the classic forms of pemphigus, indirect immunofluorescence is positive only on stratified squamous epithelial substrates.

However, in paraneoplastic pemphigus, there is staining of other tissues, including the bladder, heart, and liver. IgG autoantibodies are directed against desmoplakins I and II, which are present in stratified squamous epithelium and these other tissues. The involvement of mucous membranes is much less common with bullous pemphigoid than in pemphigus vulgaris, with blisters that are less easily ruptured. Sites involved include the oral cavity, anus, and genital mucosa. Histologic examination of a skin biopsy from a bulla reveals a subepidermal blister with superficial dermal inflammation consisting of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and eosinophils. Urticarial lesions may also be accompanied by papillary dermal edema. On histopathology, in linear IgA dermatosis and chronic bullous disease of childhood, the bullae are subepidermal, with collections of neutrophils along the basement membrane and occasionally in the dermal papillary tips.

On direct immunofluorescence, deposition of IgA in a linear pattern is noted along the basement membrane. There may also be deposition of IgG and C3.

7.6.1a Genetic testing in an affected individual (index case)

✓ The genetic testing report must provide a full and clear interpretation of the results, as the report may be read by a variety of professionals involved in the care of the patient, many of whom may not be familiar with genotyping results. It is also recommended to use HGVS nomenclature. For point sequence variants, the sequence change should be stated at the DNA level (assuming it has been characterized in DNA), and as predicted in the protein. Also for clarity it is useful to state in words what the change is, and its predicted effect. In addition, the paternal or maternal origin of the sequence variant, or its de novo occurrence, should be specified. In all mutation reports, it is essential to quote the accession number of the gene reference sequence that was used in classifying the mutation. When reporting a deletion or duplication, the report must clearly convey whether the end points of a deletion or duplication have been determined (this is not always possible in a routine diagnostic setting). The report should always mention that genetic consultation is recommended or legally obligated in most countries, and that screening for relatives is possible. Whenever appropriate, carrier risk and risk for having affected offspring should be calculated. 106 If no clear diagnosis can be made from the evidence available this must be clearly stated in the report (ACMG guidelines).

✓ The report must state that the presence of the pathogenic variant confirms, or is consistent with, the diagnosis. The report must also clearly indicate whether the variants in the gene have previously been reported to cause the disease. For the report of VUS, the variant(s) may need to be discussed in relation to the variant database such as GnomAD, ExAc or ClinVar. For a negative result, the report should clearly indicate that 'no clear pathogenic sequence variant was detected' and conclude that 'the clinical diagnosis of EB has not been explained at the molecular genetic level in this patient'. The report should also state the limitations of the technique, as well as the limitations in current understanding of the clinical manifestations of the disease. Depending on the local situation, the report may offer carrier testing and/or prenatal testing to the family, and/or suggest referral for genetic counselling.

### Acrodermatitis enteropathica-like eruption [^ba6e5ab6]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the most specific test to confirm the diagnosis?
A. Skin biopsy
B. Direct immunofluorescence
C. Genetic analysis of the MUT gene mutation
D. Dosage of urine organic acid (methylcitric acid and methylmalonic acid)
E. Dosages of blood/urine parameters (glucose level, ammonemia, bicarbonate level, and ketone)

Answers:
A. Skin biopsy – Incorrect. A skin biopsy can be performed to eliminate differential diagnoses such as autoimmune bullous dermatosis (pemphigus and bullous pemphigoid) and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Because the histopathologic findings are not specific (psoriasiform pattern, confluent necrosis of keratinocytes, and intraepidermal vacuolization, etc), a skin biopsy is not recommended.
B. Direct immunofluorescence – Incorrect. Similar to a skin biopsy, direct immunofluorescence is an invasive technique, especially for newborns and infants. The skin sample can reveal a deposit of IgG or C3, which is not specific to this diagnosis.
C. Genetic analysis of the MUT gene mutation – Correct. MMA occurs because of a defective conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA in the absence of MUT. The search for the mutation analysis is performed in specialized centers (not available in our country). It is the gold standard diagnosis and can also help in the choice of treatment strategies. It can predict whether a patient will respond to vitamin B12 injections.
D. Dosage of urine organic acid (methylcitric acid and methylmalonic acid) – Incorrect. The detection of urine organic acid using chromatography or mass spectrometry may lead to the diagnosis. However, because there are 2 types of MMA (cobalamin disorders and MUT deficiencies [non–vitamin B12]), this test is not considered the most specific and definitive laboratory test.
E. Dosages of blood/urine parameters (glucose level, ammonemia, bicarbonate level, and ketone) – Incorrect. Combined with the clinical history, the dosages of these laboratory markers are suggestive of MMA and other organic metabolic disorders, such as proprionic acidemia.

### Relationship between bullous pemphigoid and malignancy: a mendelian randomization study [^d2dd0ce8]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Mendelian randomization (MR) is a genetic epidemiological research methodology that employs single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as instrumental variables (IVs) to discern potential causal relationships between exposure factors and outcomes based on Mendelian laws of heredity. In contrast to observational studies, MR studies possess several advantages. As genetic variation is determined at the time of conception, it predates disease development and is generally unaffected by confounding factors, such as acquired factors and the social environment. Consequently, the inferred causal associations from MR studies exhibit more cogent temporality, diminish confounding bias, and mitigate reverse causation. This study utilized a two‐sample MR study design to explore the potential causal relationship between BP and malignant tumors, using the publicly available extensive genome‐wide association study (GWAS) database.

### Importance of serological tests in diagnosis of autoimmune blistering diseases [^b5d71166]. The Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Autoimmune blistering diseases are organ-specific autoimmune diseases characterized by autoantibodies against structural proteins that maintain cell-cell (pemphigus diseases) and cell-matrix adhesions (pemphigoid diseases) in the skin and mucous membranes. Over the last few decades, identification of autoantigens and extensive characterization of autoantibodies have improved understanding of the pathogenesis of these diseases. In addition, the development of new sensitive and specific immunoassays enabled accurate diagnosis and proper evaluation of disease activity in autoimmune blistering diseases. In this review, we describe practical updates for molecular diagnostic tests for autoimmune blistering diseases and the basis for interpreting the results of the assays.

### Novel molecular therapies for heritable skin disorders [^262cbeb2]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Tremendous progress has been made in the past two decades in molecular genetics of heritable skin diseases, and pathogenic mutations have been identified in as many as 500 distinct human genes. This progress has resulted in improved diagnosis with prognostic implications, has refined genetic counseling, and has formed the basis for prenatal and presymptomatic testing and preimplantation genetic diagnosis. However, there has been relatively little progress in developing effective and specific treatments for these often devastating diseases. However, very recently, a number of novel molecular strategies, including gene therapy, cell-based approaches, and protein replacement therapy, have been explored for the treatment of these conditions. This overview will focus on the prototypic heritable blistering disorders, epidermolysis bullosa, and related keratinopathies, in which significant progress has been made recently toward treatment, and it will illustrate how some of the translational research therapies have already entered the clinical arena.

### Clinical practice guidelines for laboratory diagnosis of epidermolysis bullosa [^bd328b10]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

4 Limitations of the guideline

The document has been prepared on behalf of DEBRA International and is based on the best data available at the time of the document preparation. EB is a rare disease and most of the subtypes are ultraorphan conditions (≤ 1 in 20 000). People living with EB may have their 'private' genetic variants and unusual genotype–phenotype correlations, which require individualized strategies for analysis. Moreover, experimental proof of pathogenicity of unclassified sequence variants (variants of uncertain significance, VUS) is performed in a basic research environment. Such situations are not covered by this guideline. Noninvasive prenatal diagnosis (PND) utilizing cell‐free fetal DNA and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are also not covered within this guideline. Detailed descriptions of the sequencing methods and their quality controls, and an introduction to good clinical practice of genetic counselling were beyond the scope of this guideline.

### Three case reports of post immunization and post viral bullous pemphigoid: looking for the right trigger [^dac0dca3]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The reported cases are presentations of bullous pemphigoid, the most prevalent autoimmune blistering skin disease, presenting with tense blisters on erythematous skin, predominantly affecting elderly people and unusual in infancy. Bullous pemphigoid is usually a self-limiting disease with a clinical course that may last from months to years in adults. In childhood and infancy BP usually responds well to conventional treatments, with a good prognosis.

The etiopathogenesis of bullous pemphigoid is complex and during recent years much has been postulated regarding the trigger factors related to the development of this condition, as immunizations and viral infections. None of our patients had a suggestive family history for blistering skin disease and specifically their mothers did not develop gestational pemphigoid during pregnancy.

Here we report the case of two infants who developed an eruption of bullous lesions just a few days after vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae B, while the third patient after a viral infection by HSV-1. The latency period ranged between 2 and 10 days. A too short interval from immunization to onset of skin lesions could be considered an argument against the existence of a true relationship: since IgG production begins 10–14 days post-immunization, a 2–3 day latency period would generally be considered too short a time-frame for autoimmune manifestations characterized by IgG deposition to develop. Some authors anyway have suggested that certain vaccines may unmask subclinical BP by inducing a nonspecific immune reactivation in genetically predisposed infants more sensitive to the stimulus. Others hypothesized that intrauterine transmitted maternal IgG antibodies might play a role but a vertical transference of antibodies seems unlikely since in all the cases of PB reported in the literature where tests on mother's serum were performed, circulating anti-BMZ antibodies were not found. Moreover, according to recent studies, the trauma caused by the vaccine injection may led to Th17 cell activation with increased of IL-17 which is able to release pro-inflammatory cytokines and proteolytic enzymes, which may result in blister formation. Finally, CD25 deficiency may be related to BP, since the lack of CD25+ cells has been observed in bullous pemphigoid lesions.

7.3.1a Next‐generation sequencing‐targeted gene panel and whole‐exome sequencing in epidermolysis bullosa (level of evidence 2++, grade of recommendation B)

The term NGS describes the techniques used to analyse several genes and a large number of DNA samples in parallel using high‐throughput technology. NGS can be applied to sequence only defined DNA targets (e.g. targeted gene panels) or to sequence entire exomes (whole‐exome sequencing, WES), genomes (whole‐genome sequencing) or transcriptomes (RNA‐Seq), followed by post‐test filtering. Recently, NGS has been proved to be one of the most important tools for accurately and comprehensively identifying pathogenic variants in EB. 3, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24

Table S2 (see Supporting Information) summarizes the pros and cons of different genetic testing approaches. NGS platforms and subsequent data reporting are recommended to be in accordance with the guidelines published by the European Society of Human Genetics, 25 as well as by the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS;). 26, 27

In EB (sub)types with genetic heterogeneity, in cases without a clear candidate gene, where candidate genes have been ruled out, or in cases when SS was the first chosen method and did not identify the pathogenic variant, targeted NGS with the 21 known EB genes or WES with targeted filtering for EB genes is recommended (level of evidence 2++, grade of recommendation B). 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 28 Subsequently, confirmation of novel pathogenic variants found this way should be performed by SS (level of evidence 4, grade of recommendation D). Recent data showed that in clinically unaffected parents, mosaicism may be detected by NGS more often than expected (depending on the coverage of the NGS platform), which has important impacts on genetic counselling. 29 The advantage of targeted EB gene panels is that they obviously have a much higher coverage per gene and base. However, current WES platforms should also provide sufficient coverage per gene and base to provide accurate results, but it is recommended to confirm this in individual laboratories. The regions where coverage is not reaching recommended values (at least 95% of bases more than 20 ×) should be analysed separately by SS. Finally, the power of WES in finding new genes, as well as multigene mutations, in patients with EB has been demonstrated. 12, 19, 30, 31, 32, 33

### Bullous pemphigoid: etiology, pathogenesis, and inducing factors: facts and controversies [^69a40aa3]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

The term pemphigoids includes a group of autoimmune bullous diseases characterized by subepidermal blistering. Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is not only the most common disorder within the pemphigoid group, but also represents the most frequent autoimmune blistering disease in general. The onset and course of BP depend on a variable interaction between predisposing and inducing factors. HLA genes are the most significant genetic predisposition factor to autoimmunity mechanisms. Many studies show an association between HLA-DQβ1*0301 and distinct clinical pemphigoid variants. Imbalance between autoreactive T helper (Th) and T regulatory cells, toll-like receptor activation, and Th17/IL-17 pathway are the three possible autoimmunity triggers underlying BP. The pathomechanism of BP hinges on an autoantibody response toward structural components of the hemidesmosome (BP180 and BP230). The binding of autoantibodies leads to complement activation, recruitment of inflammatory cells, and release of proteolytic enzymes. The inflammatory cascade also may be directly triggered by activation of Th17 cells with no intervention of autoantibodies. The intervention of inducing factors in BP can be identified in no more than 15% of patients. Facilitating factors in genetically predisposed individuals are various (drug intake, physical agents, and viral infections). Drugs may act as triggers by either modifying the immune response or altering the antigenic properties of the epidermal basement membrane. Cases of induction of BP by physical agents (eg, radiation therapy, ultraviolet radiation, thermal or electrical burns, surgical procedures, transplants) are rare, but well-documented events. A contributing role in inducing BP has been suggested for infections, in particular human herpes virus (HHV) infections (cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and HHV-6), but also hepatitis B and C viruses, Helicobacter pylori, and Toxoplasma gondii. Unlike pemphigus, no dietary triggers have been suspected of being involved in the induction of BP. In all patients who have a diagnosis of BP, an environmental agent as a potential cause should always be considered, because the prompt discontinuation of it might result in rapid improvement or even cure of the disease.

### Assessment of diagnostic strategy for early recognition of bullous and nonbullous variants of pemphigoid [^3fe25d7e]. JAMA Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

A substantial number of patients with bullous pemphigoid do not develop skin blisters and may not have received the correct diagnosis. Diagnostic criteria and an optimal diagnostic strategy are needed for early recognition and trials.

Objectives

To assess the minimal requirements for diagnosis of bullous and nonbullous forms of pemphigoid and to evaluate the optimal diagnostic strategy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This paired, multivariable, diagnostic accuracy study analyzed data from 1125 consecutive patients with suspected pemphigoid who were referred to the Groningen Center for Blistering Diseases from secondary and tertiary care hospitals throughout the Netherlands. Eligible participants were patients with paired data on at least (1) a skin biopsy specimen for the direct immunofluorescence (DIF) microscopy test; (2) indirect immunofluorescence on a human salt-split skin substrate (IIF SSS) test; and (3) 1 or more routine immunoserologic tests administered between January 1, 2002, and May 1, 2015. Samples were taken from patients at the time of first diagnosis, before introduction of immunosuppressive therapy, and within an inclusion window of a maximum of 4 weeks. Data analysis was conducted from October 1, 2015, to December 1, 2017.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Pairwise DIF, IIF SSS, IIF on monkey esophagus, BP180 and BP230 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and immunoblot for BP180 and BP230 tests were performed. The results were reported in accordance with 2015 version of the Standards for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy.

Results

Of the 1125 patients analyzed, 653 (58.0%) were women and 472 (42.0%) were men, with a mean (SD) age of 63.2 (19.9) years. In total, 343 participants received a pemphigoid diagnosis, with 782 controls. Of the 343 patients, 74 (21.6%, or 1 in 5) presented with nonbullous pemphigoid. The DIF microscopy was the most sensitive diagnostic test (88.3% [n = 303]; 95% CI, 84.5%-91.3%), whereas IIF SSS was less sensitive (77.0% [n = 263]; 95% CI, 72.2%-81.1%) but was highly specific (99.9%; 95% CI, 99.3%-100%) and complemented most cases with negative DIF findings. Results of the BP180 NC16A enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay did not add diagnostic value for initial diagnosis in multivariable logistic regression analysis of combined tests. These findings lead to the proposed minimal criteria for diagnosing pemphigoid: (1) pruritus and/or predominant cutaneous blisters, (2) linear IgG and/or C3c deposits (in an n-serrated pattern) by DIF on a skin biopsy specimen, and (3) positive epidermal side staining of IgG by IIF SSS on a serum sample; this proposal extends bullous pemphigoid with the unrecognized nonbullous form.

Conclusions and Relevance

Both DIF and IIF SSS tests should be performed for diagnosis of the bullous and nonbullous variants of pemphigoid, and the BP180 NC16A enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is recommended as an add-on test for disease activity monitoring.

7.5.3 Limitations and uncertainty

TEM is a more expensive, labour‐intensive and time‐consuming method than IFM. It requires both highly skilled technical work for specimen processing and preparation, and specific expertise for their observation and interpretation. Thus, TEM for EB diagnosis is performed at a limited number of centres. In addition, in several EB subtypes there are no specific ultrastructural findings and TEM does not allow direct identification and quantification of the defective protein. When blistering or adhesion structure abnormalities are not present or detectable in a TEM specimen, such as with localized EBS or very mild DEB subtypes, TEM findings can be inconclusive. Finally, the determination of subtle abnormalities of epithelial adhesion structures can require morphometric analysis, which is not feasible in a routine diagnostic setting.

7.6 Reporting scenarios

✓ When issuing the report, it should include as much patient information as possible, as it is often the case that the patient with EB is under the care of different medical professionals in diverse locations or facilities. The reason for referral should be restated, which at least specifies the type of test that was requested, for example diagnostic, carrier or prenatal test. Reference to the laboratory tests carried out must include brief mention of the method(s) used and details of what was tested. According to the settings in different EB diagnostic centres, the report can be issued by a laboratory scientist or consultant dermatologist, or sometimes by both. The report should be sent only to the referral physician, and the responsibility of the staff involved in the reporting should be clearly indicated.

3 Methodology

The CPG development group consisted of dermatologists, paediatric dermatologists, geneticists, biologists and a nurse, and additionally patient representatives. All panel members completed written conflict of interest and code of conduct declarations. The evidence‐based development of clinical recommendations was led by two panel members (C.H. and L.L.). During the guideline development, the group met twice in face‐to‐face meetings (at least six members physically present) to discuss the clinical questions and methodology, to review the evidence and the recommendations, and to agree on structure and wording. Whenever input from the entire group was required, it was solicited via e‐mail. A research assistant (S.B.) coordinated communications and contributed to the preparation of the documents and manuscript.

To identify publications, a search of NCBI 'All Databases' and PubMed was performed using the terms 'inherited EB and laboratory diagnosis', 'EB and mutation' and 'EB and prenatal diagnosis', with the search period ending in December 2017. In addition, 'epidermolysis bullosa' was used to search articles in GeneReviews. In total 1485 articles were identified. In light of technological advances, articles published before 2010 were excluded from the appraisal, unless newer publications on a topic were lacking (e.g. prenatal diagnosis of EB). Case reports were only considered when they reported relevant methodology. Seven papers published between November 2017 and August 2018 were appraised, and many other recent publications were added because of their relevant contents.

Sixty‐four papers were appraised, each by two panel members, according to the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme 1 and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network quality rating (Appendix S1; see Supporting Information). 2 No meta‐analyses, systematic reviews or case–control studies were available. The highest level of evidence was achieved by high‐quality cohort studies.

7.6.1b Carrier testing

✓ If the pathogenic variant is confirmed, the report should clearly state that the variant found in this individual is identical to the variant determined from the index case in the family, and therefore this individual is a carrier for this variant. Suggestion for genetic counselling and PND can also be made at this stage. For predictive diagnosis for a partner of a carrier, complete coverage can be achieved by diagnosis with an NGS EB gene panel; nevertheless, predictive genetic testing depends on national regulations and usually requires genetic counselling in advance.

7.6.1c Prenatal diagnostic report

✓ The implication of the pathogenic variant present or absent in the PND must be clearly stated, and whether the fetus is clinically affected or unaffected must also be clearly stated. According to the local regulation, it should be stated whether the fetus is a carrier or not. The test results for maternal contamination also need to be clearly stated to confirm the validity of the result further. According to local regulation, the sex of the fetus can be indicated in the report if the person who requests the report feels such information might be of interest.

In addition to the aforementioned details of a report, when NGS analysis has been performed, the report must also include a list of genes tested within a particular panel. All variants reported need to be annotated according to HGVS nomenclature. The transcript being used to provide the c. and p. nomenclature and exon numbering should be provided in the report.

7.6.2 Report for IFM

✓ The report for IFM should include a list of the primary antibodies used, the expected staining pattern and the strength of signal observed in normal control skin for each antibody, compared with the staining pattern and signal strength in patient skin. A clear conclusion should be made from these observations when the result is conclusive. However, IFM may sometimes lead to an unclear or inconclusive result such as 'no significant difference has been observed between normal control skin and patient skin, and no blister formation'. In these cases the report should suggest the possibility of further tests, or a differential diagnosis.

### Real-life impact of immunologic tests to predict relapse after treatment cessation in patients with bullous pemphigoid: a French multicenter retrospective study [^d862adea]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

A high level of anti-BP180 antibodies on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a persistent positive direct immunofluorescence at the end of treatment (immunologic tests, [ITs]) are predictors of relapse after treatment cessation (TC) in patients with bullous pemphigoid.

Objective

To evaluate the real-life impact of the immunologic-based decision of TC on the 3- and 6-month relapse rates after TC in bullous pemphigoid.

Methods

Retrospective multicentric study included patients followed almost 6 months after TC. Patients were classified according to whether the TC decision was in accordance with the results of ITs performed during the 3 months before TC, despite the results of ITs or without ITs performed.

Results

We included 238 patients. Three months after TC, 36 patients showed relapse: 14 of 95 patients with TC in accordance with IT results (14.7%); 5 of 21 with TC despite ITs (23.8%); and 17 of 122 with TC without ITs (13.9%; P = 0.5). Six months after TC, the relapse rate was 18.9%, 28.6%, and 18.9% (P = 0.56), respectively, in the 3 groups.

Limitations

The retrospective design and the limited follow up.

Conclusion

In real-life practice, in bullous pemphigoid, the 3- and 6-month relapse rates were not significantly reduced with TC decision based on results of ITs as compared with a classic clinical-based decision.

7.3.1b Sanger sequencing (level of evidence 2++, grade of recommendation B)

Direct bidirectional SS has been the first diagnostic method for identifying the pathogenic variants in EB. All over the world, similar Sanger‐based protocols have been successful for disclosing causative pathogenic sequence variants in EB genes. 11, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products (300–600 bp in size) are generated using gene‐specific primer pairs (sequences have been published for EB genes) covering the coding regions and the exon–intron boundaries. Subsequently these are examined by SS.

Direct SS is a rapid and cost‐ and time‐effective method for (i) genetic testing of small known candidates genes; (ii) carrier identification when the family's pathogenic variant is known; (iii) prevalent founder or ethnic pathogenic variant screening, with a remarkable impact in highly consanguineous populations associated with different EB genes; 34, 36, 37, 40, 44 (iv) confirming pathogenic variants identified using other genetic techniques, as recommended by The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG); 45 and (v) PND. 46, 47

### Clinical practice guidelines for laboratory diagnosis of epidermolysis bullosa [^e8aaa632]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Lack of blistering and/or normal expression of tested antigens can be inconclusive and preclude a diagnosis of the EB type or subtype. In such cases TEM findings, if available, can be helpful for evaluation, and genetic testing should be carried out. In specific cases, the clinical diagnosis of EB should be reconsidered.

The sensitivity and specificity of IFM have been compared with those of TEM 77, 78 or evaluated in relation to clinical diagnosis in a few case series of patients with all types of suspected EB. 62, 73, 79 In only two of these studies the internal reference standard was genetic diagnosis. 62, 77 Of note, the only prospective study, which used genetic testing as an independent standard criterion to measure the diagnostic accuracy of each test, reported that IFM is more sensitive and specific than TEM, although the difference did not reach statistical significance due to an insufficient number of samples evaluated. 77

✓ If genetic testing identifies VUS, or no pathogenic variants in EB‐associated genes are found, alterations in the immunostaining pattern and intensity may provide valuable information on the affected protein. 80, 81 Moreover, in such situations, obtaining keratinocytes and/or fibroblasts from a patient's skin sample enables expression and functional studies.

7.4.5 Limitations and uncertainty

There are a few limitations of IFM applied to EB diagnosis: (i) the presence of artificial splits or protein degradation or a sample denuded of epidermis, due to inappropriate sampling, transport and storage, can be confusing; (ii) the absence of blisters in sample sections and a normal immunoreactivity to the various markers tested are frequent in cases of mild skin fragility such as with localized EBS or DEB; (iii) changes in the expression pattern and intensity may be observed with multiple markers, making interpretation difficult; (iv) using an extended IFM panel can make the test expensive, particularly in resource‐limited settings; and (v) using an IFM panel with a limited number of antibodies can lead to an erroneous interpretation of the results and inconclusive or even incorrect diagnosis.

7.5 Electron microscopy (level of evidence 2+, grade of recommendation C)

Electron microscopy led to the initial classification of EB into three major types – simplex, junctional and dystrophic – based on the precise level of tissue separation. 82, 83, 84

### Relationship between bullous pemphigoid and malignancy: a mendelian randomization study [^b9125594]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This was the first study to assess a causal relationship between BP and malignant tumors through a MR approach. Using publicly available BP and malignant tumor GWAS data, we systematically scrutinized the genetic associations between BP prediction and malignant tumors. After Benjamini–Hochberg correction, no causal link was found between the genetic susceptibility of BP and 13 distinct malignant tumors. There are areas of agreement or contradiction between our conclusions and those of previous observational studies.

In a retrospective cohort study, which included 99 BP patients from two hospitals, no significant association was found between BP and malignancy. The rates of malignancy did not significantly differ between BP patients and controls (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.47–1.58). This conclusion is consistent with our findings. In a systematic review and meta‐analysis of eight studies, no association was found between BP and overall malignancy (OR 2.04, 95% CI 0.97–4.31), but a possible association was observed between BP and hematological malignancy (OR 2.60, 95% CI 2.08–3.24). Several retrospective studies reported that BP is not associated with overall malignancy, but with specific malignancies. This conflicts with the conclusions of our study. For example, Baum et al.reported a positive correlation between BP and an increased susceptibility to melanoma. Schulze et al.noted that patients with BP exhibited an increased risk of hematological malignancies (OR 2.55, 95% CI 2.07–3.13). Our findings indicated no causal relationship between BP and malignant tumors. Some of the previous observational studies may have been confounded by potential covariates, such as age. As BP is more prevalent in the elderly, the incidence of malignancies is higher in this demographic. Two supporting studies bolster this perspective. Lindelöf et al.observed no significant difference in circulating anti‐basement membrane antibody titers between BP patients with and without malignancies. They also calculated the expected number of malignancies in BP patients based on age‐ and sex‐standardized incidence data, finding no significant disparity compared with observed cases. Similarly, in a parallel study, Cai et al.compared expected cancer cases in the general population with actual occurrences in BP patients (matched for sex and age), revealing no significant difference. Another potential confounding factor could be the use of glucocorticoids or immunosuppressants. Therefore, a prospective study is needed to control for these potential confounding factors.

### Diagnostic testing in gestational bullous pemphigoid: has enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay replaced direct immunofluorescence as the new gold standard? [^f3fff2f4]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

GBP, previously known as herpes gestationis, is a vesiculobullous autoimmune disease that affects 1 in 50,000 pregnancies.GBP presents in the second or third trimester, and cutaneous involvement includes pruritic urticarial papules, plaques, vesicles, or bullae that start on the umbilicus and spread to the extremities. Often, the condition is exacerbated in the postpartum period and with subsequent pregnancies. GBP is caused by circulating complement-fixing IgG autoantibodies directed against the bullous pemphigoid antigen of 180 kd (BP180 or type XVII collagen), a transmembrane protein found in the epidermal basal membrane zone. This interaction causes separation of the epidermis from the dermis. However, these autoantibodies also bind to the chorionic and amniotic epithelia and cause placental insufficiency, which can result in prematurity and small-for-gestational-age infants. The passive transfer of autoantibodies from mothers with GBP to fetuses can cause skin blistering in the newborn, underscoring the importance of early detection and treatment.

DIF, the gold standard diagnostic test for GBP, is a staining procedure that measures tissue-bound autoantibodies. Although DIF provides limited information about the tissue antigen, diagnosis can be made based on the immunoglobulin subclass and binding pattern. For GBP, DIF shows a linear deposition of IgG and/or C3 along the dermoepidermal junction. Although the presence of C3 is pathognomonic for GBP, IgG deposits are present only 25% to 30% of the time and are not required for diagnosis.DIF is considered a first-line diagnostic test because it has historically been used to diagnose pemphigoid diseases. Moreover, it is accessible in most laboratories and does not require specialty services. Because of this, DIF is typically recommended for any pregnant patient presenting with urticarial lesions and if GBP is suspected. The sensitivity and specificity of DIF in the diagnosis of GBP are not well reported; however, they have been reported for the diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid (BP), a subtype of bullous skin diseases caused by antibody response toward the hemidesmosome (Table I).

### Association of HLA class I and class II alleles with bullous pemphigoid in Chinese hans [^592c15ab]. Journal of Dermatological Science (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is one of the most common autoimmune skin diseases. Associations of genes, especially human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ alleles, with BP indicate that genetic predisposition contributes to the disease.

Objectives

To evaluate the association of HLA class I and HLA class II alleles with susceptibility to BP in the northern Chinese Han population.

Methods

We performed genotype for HLA-A, -B, -C, -G, -DPA1, -DPB1, -DQA1, -DQB1 and -DRB1 loci in 105 patients with BP by Sanger sequence-based typing (SBT) method. These data were compared with a local control cohort of 420 age- and sex-matched cases.

Results

Among the HLA alleles described herein, the susceptibility alleles associated with a high prevalence of BP were A✱11:01 (OR = 1.9 Pc = 0.017); B✱37:01 (OR = 8, Pc = 1.811 × 10–6); G*01:01 (OR = 3.61, Pc = 2.839 × 10–15) and G*01:06 (OR = 2.22, Pc = 0.025); DQA1✱01:05 (OR = 4.87, Pc = 5.822 × 10–5), DQA1✱05:05 (OR = 2.64, Pc = 9.114 × 10–4), and DQA1✱05:08 (OR = 10.2, Pc = 0.016); DQB1✱03:01 (OR = 1.69, Pc = 0.048) and DQB1✱05:01 (OR = 3.42, Pc = 7.28 × 10–6); and DRB1✱10:01 (OR = 6.85, Pc = 2.63 × 10–6). To the contrary, HLA-DQA1✱01:02 (OR = 0.46, Pc = 8.603 × 10–4) and DQA1✱01:03 (OR = 0.38, Pc = 0.048); DQB1✱02:02 (OR = 0.28, Pc = 0.016); and DRB1✱07:01 (OR = 0.26, Pc = 0.004) had significant associations with protection against BP. In addition, the frequency of haplotype HLA-DRB1✱13-DQA1✱05-DQB1✱03 (OR = 12.32, Pc = 0.026) in BP patients was significantly higher than those in controls.

Conclusion

Our data demonstrated that the alleles and haplotypes found in this study may be important differential genetic markers for susceptibility to or protection against BP in individuals of northern Chinese Han population.

### Association between HLA-DRB1 polymorphisms and pemphigus vulgaris: a meta-analysis [^66c5c010]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Meta-analysis is an established and effective strategy to increase the sample size by pooling data from individual studies to enhance the statistical power of the analysis. However, in our meta-analysis several limitations exist that may impact the interpretation of our results. First, many of the studies involved in our meta-analysis did not control for matching variables, such as age, sex or ethnicity. Each of these could have confounded the studies' estimates. Second, nonsignificant results are less likely to be accepted for publication and inclusion among the searchable literature. Any type of missing data can cause false-positive results. Although we performed Begg's and Egger's regression tests and found no significant publication bias, we cannot completely rule out the possibility of disequilibrium. Third, as with other complex autoimmune diseases, PV is likely to have a multifactorial cause, possibly including the combination of different genes, environmental effects and the real prevalence of each variant in the population. We did not analyse the complex interplay between various genes due to limited data, and our conclusions were drawn without considering environmental or inherent factors. Fourth, HLA genotyping techniques have different sensitivities. For example, results from polymerase chain reaction with probe hybridization do not always coincide with sequencing results. Yet, we did not include the particular methodologies used in our meta-analysis. Fifth, some relevant published or unpublished data may be overlooked or beyond the scope of our discovery strategy. Finally, pemphigus is a relatively rare and severe disease. As such, it is difficult for clinicians to conduct large-scale randomized controlled trials. The case–control studies used in our meta-analysis were based on small samples and were of lower scientific evidence level, which might have decreased our ability to detect a difference in the distribution of HLA-DRB1.

### Autoimmune blistering diseases in the elderly [^4d037723]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Autoimmune blistering diseases are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly population. Given the advancing age of the population, the incidence of these disorders, particularly bullous pemphigoid, is expected to rise. This contribution reviews autoimmune immunobullous disorders of particular relevance in the elderly population. These include bullous pemphigoid, cicatricial pemphigoid, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, pemphigus, paraneoplastic pemphigus, and linear immunoglobulin A bullous dermatosis. Because therapy and management of individual immunobullous dermatoses differ, establishing the diagnosis is often critically important. An overall approach to bullous diseases in the elderly, as well as key clinical features, appropriate diagnostic tests, microscopic findings, immunofluorescence microscopy patterns, and molecular targets for select disorders are reviewed. Elucidation of antigenic targets at the molecular level has allowed for development of serum enzyme-linked immunofluorescence assays, which have enhanced diagnostic accuracy for several autoimmune blistering disorders. Given the relative rarity of these diseases, large randomized trials evaluating efficacy of various treatments are few, and therapy for most immunobullous disorders in the elderly has not been standardized. Despite this, appropriate therapeutic considerations for each condition are presented and the evidence for them is reviewed.

### Nutrition and bullous diseases [^40f98c19]. Clinics in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Although relatively uncommon, autoimmune bullous diseases carry the risk of increased mortality and can significantly impact quality of life. This group of diseases is broad and encompasses subepidermal conditions such as bullous pemphigoid, cicatricial pemphigoid, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, dermatitis herpetiformis, and linear IgA bullous dermatosis, as well as intraepidermal conditions such as pemphigus and its variants. The pathophysiology of each condition is incompletely understood but broadly involves the formation of autoantibodies targeting skin adhesion proteins, a process that relies on a complex interplay between a dysregulated immune system, genetic predisposition, and environmental factors. We review the impact of nutrition on pathogenesis, clinical course, and treatment of various autoimmune bullous diseases.

### Development of a clinical diagnostic matrix for characterizing inherited epidermolysis bullosa [^7aa80cfd]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Accurately diagnosing the subtype of epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is critical for management and genetic counselling. Modern laboratory techniques are largely inaccessible in developing countries, where the diagnosis remains clinical and often inaccurate.

Objectives

To develop a simple clinical diagnostic tool to aid in the diagnosis and subtyping of EB.

Methods

We developed a matrix indicating presence or absence of a set of distinctive clinical features (as rows) for the nine most prevalent EB subtypes (as columns). To test an individual patient, presence or absence of these features was compared with the findings expected in each of the nine subtypes to see which corresponded best. If two or more diagnoses scored equally, the diagnosis with the greatest number of specific features was selected. The matrix was tested using findings from 74 genetically characterized patients with EB aged > 6 months by an investigator blinded to molecular diagnosis. For concordance, matrix diagnoses were compared with molecular diagnoses.

Results

Overall, concordance between the matrix and molecular diagnoses for the four major types of EB was 91.9%, with a kappa coefficient of 0.88 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81–0.95; P < 0.001]. The matrix achieved a 75.7% agreement in classifying EB into its nine subtypes, with a kappa coefficient of 0.73 (95% CI 0.69–0.77; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

The matrix appears to be simple, valid and useful in predicting the type and subtype of EB. An electronic version will facilitate further testing.

### Diagnostic challenge: juvenile bullous pemphigoid with a negative BP180 ELISA [^b88f6808]. Pediatric Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an autoimmune blistering disease with pathogenesis primarily mediated by autoantibodies targeting BP180 (also termed collagen XVII). These antibodies target the extracellular NC16A region of BP180 in ~90% of patients, while the serum of the remaining patients targets other areas of the BP180 protein, known as "atypical or non‐NC16A BP". This is a diagnostic issue since the CLIA‐approved BP180 ELISA screens only for reactivity to NC16A and will result in a negative test in this patient subset.

Juvenile BP is much less common but shares the same phenotype with sub‐epidermal blisters and deposition of IgG and C3 at the dermo‐epidermal junction (DEJ). Autoantibodies in juvenile BP also target BP180 and the disease runs a limited course, usually resolving within 2–5 years. Due to the rarity of juvenile BP, the incidence of the atypical form is unknown. We report a case of juvenile BP with a negative serum BP180 ELISA test that highlights the need for a complete immunodiagnostic workup in these patients.

### Cytokine gene polymorphisms in bullous pemphigoid in a Chinese population [^8e1bc38e]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an autoimmune bullous disease mostly associated with autoantibodies to the hemidesmosomal BP autoantigens BP180 and BP230. High levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interferon (IFN)-gamma have been detected in skin lesions or sera of patients with BP. Cytokine gene polymorphisms may affect cytokine production and contribute to susceptibility to autoimmune diseases. Until now, no cytokine gene polymorphism study has been conducted on patients with BP.

Objectives

We aimed to determine whether the genetic polymorphisms of the cytokine genes might influence the development of BP.

Methods

DNA samples were obtained from 96 BP patients and 174 control subjects. Using direct sequencing and microsatellite genotyping, we examined 23 polymorphisms in 11 cytokine genes including the IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, IL-4 receptor, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma genes.

Results

Although the BP patients were more likely to carry the -511T and -31C alleles of the IL-1beta gene (P = 0.04), the significance disappeared after correction for multiple testing (Pc). There was complete linkage disequilibrium between the -511T and -31C alleles of the IL-1beta gene. In female patients with BP, the associations with IL-1beta (-511T) and (-31C) alleles were much stronger (68% vs. 40.6%, odds ratio = 3.11, Pc = 0.006). No significantly different allelic and genotypic distributions of other cytokine gene polymorphisms could be found between the patients with BP and controls. Moreover, no association with the extent of disease involvement (localized or generalized) was observed.

Conclusions

The IL-1beta (-511) and (-31) polymorphisms were significantly associated with BP in women. The other genetic polymorphisms of cytokine genes that we analysed do not appear to be associated with BP susceptibility in our Chinese population.

### Pemphigoid variants affecting the skin [^6bec3617]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Pemphigoid diseases are autoimmune subepidermal blistering diseases affecting the skin and mucous membranes, which are caused by autoantibodies targeting structural hemidesmosomal proteins or hemidesmosome-associated proteins. Variants of pemphigoid can be differentiated based on targeted antigens and clinical aspects. In this review, we will discuss pemphigoid variants that predominantly affect the skin, and provide clinicians with clues to diagnosis.

### Bullous pemphigoid: from the clinic to the bench [^39951d1d]. Clinics in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Bullous pemphigoid (BP) constitutes the most frequent autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease. It is associated with autoantibodies directed against the BP antigens 180 (BP180, BPAG2) and BP230 (BPAG1-e). The pathogenicity of anti-BP180 antibodies has been convincingly demonstrated in animal models. The clinical features of BP are extremely polymorphous. The diagnosis of BP critically relies on immunopathologic findings. The recent development of novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays has allowed the detection of circulating autoantibodies with relatively high sensitivity and specificity. Although potent topical steroids have emerged in the past decade as first-line treatment of BP, management of the disease may be challenging.

### HLA-DR and DQ polymorphisms in bullous pemphigoid from Northern China [^abdab8f3]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an autoimmune disease mediated by autoantibodies against hemidesmosome components. This study used PCR-sequence-specific primers to genotype polymorphisms in HLA-DR and DQ in 25 BP patients and 57 normal controls from northern China. We found lower frequencies of DRB1✱08 (DR8) and DRB1✱08/DQB1✱06 (DR8/DQ6) haplotypes in BP patients than in controls (4.08% vs. 15.19% and 1.54% vs. 13.82%, respectively; P < 0.05), suggesting a protective role for DR8 and DR8/DQ6 haplotypes in BP patients from northern China; there were no statistical differences among other alleles tested. This result is strikingly different from previous reports that DQB1✱0301 is associated with BP in Caucasian patients and DRB1✱1101, DQB1✱0302, DRB1✱04/DQA1✱0301/DQB1✱0302 and DRB1✱1101/ DQA1✱0505/DQB1✱0302 with Japanese BP patients. Ethnic differences in the polymorphic composition of the HLA-DR and DQ genes may influence genetic susceptibility to BP.

### Childhood bullous pemphigoid: report of three cases [^c6ac3ad1]. The Journal of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a disorder that rarely occurs in children. We hereby describe three cases of childhood BP aged 2–4 months, which are among the youngest reported in the literature. BP was confirmed by histopathology, direct and indirect immunofluorescence with salt-split skin test and immunoblotting. These patients were successfully treated with systemic corticosteroids with a complete clinical remission.

### Keratinocyte footprint assay discriminates antilaminin-332 pemphigoid from all other forms of pemphigoid diseases [^18f366e6]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Specific commercial tests to detect anti‐Ln‐332 autoantibodies are lacking, which results in missed or delayed diagnoses of anti‐Ln‐332 MMP. Of tests that have been developed in house, immunoprecipitation using radiolabelled keratinocyte extracts is the most sensitive and specific, but it is restricted to specialized laboratories. It is labour intensive and its high costs and risks do not make it a practical test. Immunoblot analysis has a lower and also variable sensitivity due to the amount of Ln‐332 in the substrate and the absence of conformational epitopes. 35, 40, 41 A commercial ELISA for anti‐Ln‐332 IgG is not available, but a few in‐house ELISAs have been developed by independent laboratories with varying success. The first reported ELISA for anti‐Ln‐332 used a recombinant form of Ln‐332. Its sensitivity was 91% but specificity was low as it was also positive for 40% of tested bullous pemphigoid sera. 42

### Clinical practice guidelines for laboratory diagnosis of epidermolysis bullosa [^40a28d3b]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

If a VUS is detected, interpretation of the results requires segregation analysis, predictive bioinformatics and additional analyses at the mRNA and protein levels. As more variants in EB genes are being identified, their disease‐causing roles must be interpreted in a clinical context or, if possible, by gene expression and functional studies. In such situations IFM provides valuable information on the consequences of genetic variants at the protein level, and biomaterial for further studies. In a research setting, new variants potentially affecting splicing should be confirmed for their consequences at the mRNA level. RNA‐Seq has been proved to be a reliable tool for identification of splicing errors. 52 Finally, homozygosity mapping provides a tool for screening and evaluating homozygous recessive VUS in consanguineous families. 53, 54, 55

7.3.3 Limitations and uncertainty

One of the major disadvantages of SS is that the preselection of a candidate gene is mandatory (Table 4). Even though this should be the scenario, a percentage of cases are not resolved by SS in most EB subtypes, for example up to 25% in EBS. 56 SS is unable to detect large insertion and deletion variants, deep intronic or regulatory pathogenic variants located in uncovered regions and/or variants at low levels of mosaicism; these are frequently the reasons that no variant is found. 34, 35, 41, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61 The use of complementary phylogenetic analyses and other genetic techniques has been the classical approach to circumvent these limitations of SS. Digenic inheritance 33, 38, 39 and a growing number of EB‐causative genes need to be added to the genetic complexity of EB, and these will be missed by single‐gene SS. Finally, postzygotic (somatic) mosaicism for a de novo pathogenic variant may remain undetected with SS, and requires NGS with higher read coverage.

When no pathogenic variant is found with SS or targeted NGS, the diagnosis should be re‐evaluated. If SS and NGS do not detect the disease‐causing variant in a strong candidate gene (suggested by either clinical, IFM or TEM findings), additional techniques should be exploited. These are multiplex ligation‐dependent probe amplification, reverse‐transcriptase PCR, quantitative real‐time PCR, RNA‐Seq, single‐nucleotide polymorphism arrays or Western blotting, to gain evidence of larger rearrangements, splicing alterations, chromosomal rearrangements or gene expression alterations 59 (level of evidence 2++, grade of recommendation B).

Open‐exome analysis (WES without targeted filters), in which a clinical exome could be the first step in screening all other disease‐associated genes (preferably in trio with the parents' DNA), may be done in cases where candidates have been ruled out with the techniques described above (level of evidence 2+, grade of recommendation C).

Especially with the unbiased, hypothesis‐free WES, whole‐genome sequencing and RNA‐Seq, the major challenge will be the interpretation of all available data or 'how to locate the needle in the haystack' (noise). This requires robust and reliable data analysis pipelines that are commercially available or can be built in‐house. The latter approach necessitates a dedicated bioinformatics division, which at present is not available to most diagnostic service labs. However, with the ongoing progression of DNA diagnostics and generation of terabytes of data per patient, it is predicted that bioinformatics will become an increasingly important specialty for the diagnosis of the very rare molecularly unsolved patients with EB. Taken together, such analyses will mostly be done in a research setting; international collaboration in these cases is recommended (level of evidence 4, grade of recommendation D).

### Pruritic eruption on the extremities: report of 2 generations treated with dupilumab [^7f855325]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is your diagnosis?
A. Bullous pemphigoid
B. Bullous lupus
C. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex
D. Epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa (EBP)
E. Porphyria cutanea tarda

Answers:
A. Bullous pemphigoid – Incorrect. Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune blistering disorder caused by autoantibodies targeted against bullous pemphigoid antigen 1 and bullous pemphigoid antigen 2. Histopathology would show a subepidermal blister with eosinophils; DIF would be positive for IgG and C3 in a linear pattern at the basement membrane zone (BMZ) in an N-serrated pattern. Immunofluorescence on salt-split skin would localize to the roof.
B. Bullous lupus – Incorrect. Bullous lupus is caused by circulating antibodies targeted against collagen VII; however, histopathology would show a subepidermal blister with neutrophils. DIF would show a "full-house pattern" with granular deposition of IgG, IgA, immunoglobulin (Ig) M, and C3 at the BMZ in a U-serrated pattern. Collagen VII is the target epitope in epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, a rare, acquired subepidermal bullous disease. Classically, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita shows a cell-poor subepidermal blister on histopathology. DIF would show a broad linear band of IgG > C3 in a U-serrated pattern along the BMZ. Immunofluorescence on salt-split skin in both disorders would localize to the floor.
C. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex – Incorrect. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex is an inherited blistering disorder caused by mutations in genes encoding keratin 5 and keratin 14, resulting in tissue fragility. Histopathology would show an intraepidermal split. DIF would be negative.
D. EBP – Correct. EBP is a rare subtype of inherited dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) characterized by extremely pruritic lichenified, prurigo-like plaques and nodules. Pretibial involvement is typical, but it can also involve the forearms and trunk; nail dystrophy is common. Histopathology shows hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and subepidermal cleavage. DIF is negative.
E. Porphyria cutanea tarda – Incorrect. Porphyria cutanea tarda is a blistering disorder caused by a deficiency of uroporphyrinogen III decarboxylase. Histopathology would show a subepidermal noninflammatory blister with festooning, caterpillar bodies, and periodic acid–Schiff + perivascular hyaline material. DIF would show IgM + C3 around vessels.

### Bullous pemphigoid with hyperkeratosis and palmoplantar keratoderma: three cases [^9b6632fa]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

The clinical features of bullous pemphigoid are extremely polymorphous. Several atypical forms of bullous pemphigoid have been described, and the diagnosis critically relies on immunopathological findings. We describe three bullous pemphigoid patients characterized by palmoplantar keratoderma, diffused hyperkeratotic cutaneous lesions and extremely high levels of immunoglobulin E serum. The diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid should be taken into account in patients presenting diffused hyperkeratotic cutaneous lesions and palmoplantar keratoderma, even in the absence of blisters. Alteration of the keratinization process, that could occur in patients with genetic mutations in desmosomal and hemidesmosomal genes, may also be due to circulating autoantibodies against hemidesmosomal proteins in these bullous pemphigoid patients.

Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is an autoimmune blistering disease of the skin of unknown etiology. While various environmental factors have been implicated as triggering agents, HLA association is probably the most important predisposing factor. The aim of this review is to highlight the association of HLA with pemphigus vulgaris. In addition, we present recent results showing a possible association with the nonclassical HLA-G antigen.

Methods

Patient cohort

Patients seen at our institution from April 1, 2020 to April 1, 2024 with ICD10 codes L12, T14, L10, and R23.8; keywords of "bullous", "pemphigoid", and "BP" in their dermatology clinic notes; or have bullous pemphigoid lab results (testing for bullous pemphigoid antigen II or bullous pemphigoid antigen I) were identified using a database query (n = 7946). These patients were further queried via review of medication lists to provide a list of patients who had received dupilumab (n = 152). A manual chart review was then conducted to identify patients who received dupilumab for treatment of bullous pemphigoid which was believed to be caused or exacerbated by ICI therapy per dermatology notes, yielding a final cohort of 17 patients.

Clinical characteristics and outcomes

Patients' charts were reviewed for clinical data including dates of ICI treatment, irBP symptoms, systemic treatments received for irBP, response to BP treatment, and dates of last follow-up, death, first progression of the primary malignancy, and adverse events. Additionally, patients' charts were reviewed for demographic information, laboratory results relevant to bullous pemphigoid and the mechanism of dupilumab (BP180, BP230, IL5, IL6, and IgE), and pathological analyses for sites of irBP that were biopsied. ICI-related bullous pemphigoid diagnoses were confirmed via review of clinical notes, serum testing for bullous pemphigoid associated antibodies (via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and indirect immunofluorescence), and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) findings. Biopsy results were reviewed by a dermatopathologist.

The primary outcome of this study was treatment response of irBP to dupilumab, which was determined from clinical documentation. Patients who achieved "resolution" or "complete response" of irBP at follow up were categorized as having complete response (CR), while those who experienced an improvement in irBP grade or were marked as "improved" or "improving" were categorized as having partial response (PR). Patients who experience no benefit from therapy were categorized as having no response (NR). Patients were followed until the cutoff date of April 1, 2024. Descriptive statistics and graphical methods were used to describe the patient and clinical characteristics, and clinical outcomes.

Quality assessment for included studies

In consideration of the various and complex nature of observational studies, we evaluated the internal validity of each selected article from different aspects. After referring to the treatise of Chalmers et al. and making minor modifications, we determined a unified form for assessing study quality that comprised four basic elements. First, the quality evaluation of 'subjects' was based on whether or not (i) selection criteria were used for the PV cases, including a specific definition of the diagnosis; and (ii) the control group was composed of individuals who were healthy and unrelated to the PV cases. Second, 'comparability' between PV cases and controls was judged according to statistical similarity in age, sex, ethnicity and area of residence. Third, the assessment of study 'outcome' was based on whether or not (i) the author mentioned use of blinding methods during the steps of data collection or interpretation of results; (ii) the results were clearly presented (with ORs and P -values); (iii) the results were comprehensive and objective (with negative results included); and (iv) a statement about regular heredity or Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium testing was included. Each paper was scored for these criteria on a scale of 0–10, with ≥ 5 indicating high quality and < 5 indicating low quality.

### Prospects for autoimmune disease: research advances in pemphigus [^c717ac3d]. JAMA (2001). Excellent credibility.

Pemphigus is an autoimmune disorder, known to be caused by autoantibodies directed against critical adhesion molecules of squamous epithelial cells, the desmogleins. These autoantibodies induce blistering of skin and mucosal surfaces and lead to severe morbidity and, potentially, death. Key factors include associated major histocompatibility complex class II genes, the structure of the desmoglein antigens, and the role of autoantibody in impairing cellular adhesion. This article discusses the precise structure of the major histocompatibility complex class II gene-peptide-T-cell receptor complex involved and of the environmental and genetic factors that induce autoimmunity against desmoglein 1. Discovery of antigen-specific immunotherapy and insight into environmental factors that initiate autoimmunity in genetically susceptible individuals are needed.

### Association between HLA-DRB1 polymorphisms and pemphigus vulgaris: a meta-analysis [^9b6ba499]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Pemphigus is a rare and sometimes fatal autoimmune bullous disorder that manifests as flaccid, painful, nonhealing blisters or ulcerations on the skin and mucosal surfaces. Histologically, pemphigus is characterized by the presence of epidermal acantholysis, as a result of circulating and tissue-fixed antibodies against keratinocyte surface antigens, separation of desmosomes and dissolution of the intercellular material. If left untreated, the resulting widespread bullae and erosions can increase the probability of infection, aggravate metabolic disturbance, and trigger an inappropriate and detrimental immune response. The disease ordinarily requires long-term therapy, most often with systemic corticosteroids; however, these treatments are associated with serious side-effects. Thus, there is an urgent need to gain a detailed understanding of the aetiology and pathogenesis of pemphigus.

Pemphigus onset usually occurs between the 4th and 6th decades of life and has been reported in various populations. Worldwide annual incidence has been estimated at 0.76–6.7 cases per million. Three basic forms of pemphigus are currently recognized, based on distinctive clinical signs and pathology: pemphigus vulgaris (PV), pemphigus foliaceus and paraneoplastic pemphigus. PV is the most commonly diagnosed form, and accounts for approximately 80% of all pemphigus cases. In PV, mucous membranes are affected and the circulating autoantibodies mainly target the desmosomal cadherin family member, desmoglein (Dsg) 3. It has been demonstrated that Dsg3-reactive T and B cells both indirectly regulate formation of pathogenic autoantibodies. The presence of IgG1 and IgG4 against Dsg3 was directly related to the ratio of Dsg3-reactive Th1/Th2 cells, and autoreactive T cells, that recognized epitopes of the extracellular domain of Dsg3, were restricted by PV-associated human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1 alleles. Furthermore, autoimmune responses to Dsg3 may be strictly regulated by the hydrophobic amino acid residues Phe 26, Leu 67 and Val 86 and hydrophilic amino acid residues at positions 70 and 71 on the HLA-DR β chain.

### Diagnostic challenge: juvenile bullous pemphigoid with a negative BP180 ELISA [^03290049]. Pediatric Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an autoimmune blistering disease primarily affecting the elderly, whereas cases of juvenile BP are rare. Both types of BP are typically mediated by autoantibodies targeting the NC16A region of BP180; however, a small subset of adult patient sera react to other regions of the protein. The incidence of a similar occurrence in juvenile BP is unknown. This case of juvenile BP with a negative BP180 ELISA highlights diagnostic pitfalls that can lead to a delay in the correct diagnosis in the pediatric population.

### Research techniques made simple: genome-wide homozygosity / autozygosity mapping is a powerful tool for identifying candidate genes in autosomal recessive genetic diseases [^20187cdb]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Homozygosity mapping (HM), also known as autozygosity mapping, was originally used to map genes underlying homozygous autosomal recessive Mendelian diseases in patients from closely genetically related populations, followed by Sanger sequencing. With the increase in use of next-generation sequencing approaches, such as whole-exome sequencing and whole-genome sequencing, together with advanced bioinformatics filtering approaches, HM is again emerging as a powerful method for the identification of genes involved in disease etiology. In addition to its usefulness for research, HM is effective in clinical genetic services, increasing the efficiency of molecular diagnostics. For autosomal recessive Mendelian disorders with extensive genetic heterogeneity, HM can reduce both cost and turnaround time of mutation detection in the context of next-generation sequencing and can obviate expensive screening, such as biochemical testing in the setting of metabolic genodermatoses or antigen mapping for epidermolysis bullosa. It is therefore important for dermatology clinicians and researchers to understand the processes, principal uses, and advantages and limitations of HM when ordering or performing genetic tests for patients affected by heritable skin disorders.

### Association of genetic variants of HLA-DQA1 with bullous pemphigoid induced by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors [^a5f072f8]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is the most common autoimmune blistering disorder. Several factors, including an antidiabetic (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor [DPP-4i]), have been reported to trigger BP. To identify the genetic variants associated with BP, GWAS and HLA fine-mapping analyses were conducted. The 21 cases of noninflammatory BP induced by DPP-4i (i.e. DPP-4i-induced noninflammatory BP) and 737 controls (first cohort) and the 8 cases and 164 controls (second cohort) were included in the GWAS. Combining GWAS satisfied the genome-wide significant association of HLA-DQA1 (chromosome 6, rs3129763 [T/C]) with the risk of DPP-4i-induced noninflammatory BP (allele T carrier of 72.4% [21 of 29] in cases vs. 15.3% [138 of 901] in controls; dominant model, OR = 14, P = 1.8 × 10–9). HLA fine mapping revealed that HLA-DQA1∗05 with serine at position 75 of HLA-DQα1 (Ser75) had the most significant association with the combined cohort of DPP-4i-induced noninflammatory BP (79.3% [23 of 29] cases vs. 16.1% [145 of 901] controls; dominant model, OR = 21, P = 2.0 × 10–10). HLA-DQα1 Ser75 polymorphism was located inside the functional pocket of HLA-DQ molecules, suggesting the impact of HLA-DQα1 Ser75 on DPP-4i-induced noninflammatory BP.

### Autoimmune bullous diseases the spectrum of infectious agent antibodies and review of the literature [^396134a1]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Pemphigus and bullous pemphigoid are two autoimmune diseases that have a similar pathogenesis. Both have a genetic predisposition which promotes the production of auto-antibodies targeted against different components of the epidermal desmosome and hemidesmosome. Environmental factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of this autoimmune disease. Among these, the role of infectious agents was debated as a causative factor. We sought to determine a possible connection between various infectious agents and autoimmune bullous disease (ABD). A cohort of 148 serum samples of patients with pemphigus, bullous pemphigoid and controls was screened for evidence of a prior infection with HBV, HCV, EBV, CMV, Helicobacter pylori, Toxoplasma gondii and Treponema pallidum, utilizing the Bio-Rad BioPlex 2200 system as well as ELISA assays to complete the panel. HBV, HCV, H. pylori, T. gondii and CMV were demonstrated to have significantly higher prevalence of antibodies in patients with pemphigus and bullous pemphigoid in comparison to controls. Among them, we found a novel association between H. pylori and ABD. Our study suggests a contributing role for HBV, HCV, H. pylori, T. gondii and CMV in inducing ABD in the genetically susceptible host.

### The association between frontotemporal lobar degeneration and bullous pemphigoid [^1ff31e97]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Recent studies have shown an epidemiological and immunological association between bullous pemphigoid (BP) and several neurological or psychiatric diseases. Here, our aim was for the first time to specify whether an association exists between BP and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Medical histories of FTLD patients (N = 196) were screened for clinical comorbidity, and BP180 and BP230 autoantibodies were analyzed in the sera of FTLD patients (N = 70, including 24 C9orf72 repeat expansion carriers) by BP180-NC16A-ELISA and BP230-ELISA. One FTLD patient (C9orf72 repeat expansion carrier) had a comorbid diagnosis of BP. Increased levels of serum BP180 autoantibodies (cutoff value > 9 U/ml) were detected more often in FTLD patients (10.0%) than in controls (4.9%). Moreover, elevated levels of both BP180 and BP230 autoantibodies were found more often in C9orf72 repeat expansion-carrying FTLD than non-carrying patients or controls. However, none of these differences reached a statistical significance likely due to our limited cohort size. In conclusion, our findings suggest that subset of FTLD patients especially with the C9orf72 repeat expansion may have an immunological association with BP.

### Bullous pemphigoid: a review of its diagnosis, associations and treatment [^f0899db5]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is the most common autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease in Western countries, and typically affects the elderly. BP is immunologically characterized by tissue-bound and circulating autoantibodies directed against either the BP antigen 180 (BP180, or BPAG2) or the BP antigen 230 (BP230, or BPAG1e), or even both, which are components of hemidesmosomes involved in the dermal-epidermal cohesion. Risk factors for BP include old age, neurologic diseases (dementia, Parkinson's disease, cerebrovascular disease), and some particular drugs, including loop diuretics, spironolactone and neuroleptics. The spectrum of clinical presentations is extremely broad. Clinically, BP is an intensely pruritic erythematous eruption with widespread blister formation. In the early stages, or in atypical, non-bullous variants of the disease, only excoriated, eczematous or urticarial lesions (either localized or generalized) are present. The diagnosis of BP relies on immunopathologic findings, especially based on both direct and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy observations, as well as on anti-BP180/BP230 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). BP is usually a chronic disease, with spontaneous exacerbations and remissions, which may be accompanied by significant morbidity. In the past decade, potent topical corticosteroids have emerged as an effective and safe first-line treatment for BP, but their long-term feasibility is still controversial. Newer therapeutic agents targeting molecules involved in the inflammatory cascade associated with BP represent future alternatives to classical immunosuppressant drugs for maintenance therapy.

We retrospectively reviewed records of patients seen at our institution during January 1, 2005-December 31, 2015, who were positive for BP180 or BP230 autoantibodies and had a negative DIF study finding. These patients' demographic characteristics and BP180 and BP230 levels were compared with those of a BP control group who were positive for BP180 or BP230 autoantibodies and had positive DIF study findings.

Results

We identified 208 patients with BP autoantibodies but without positive DIF study findings. These patients' mean age and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay values were significantly lower than those of the control group. Dermatitis was the most common final clinical diagnosis. Of the 208 patients, 41 (19.7%) had at least 2 years' follow-up. Four patients had positive DIF results upon repeating the test and ultimately received pemphigoid diagnoses.

Limitations

Retrospective design with limited follow-up.

Conclusion

Patients might harbor serum BP autoantibodies in the context of a wide range of dermatoses. Low positive BP180 and BP230 autoantibody levels should not be overinterpreted as evidence for BP in the setting of a negative DIF.

### Research techniques made simple: mouse models of Autoimmune blistering diseases [^03ca0820]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Autoimmune blistering diseases are examples of autoantibody-mediated, organ-specific autoimmune disorders. Based on a genetic susceptibility, such as a strong HLA-class II association, as yet unknown triggering factors induce the formation of circulating and tissue-bound autoantibodies that are mainly directed against adhesion structures of the skin and mucous membranes. Compared with other autoimmune diseases, especially systemic disorders, the pathogenicity of autoimmune blistering diseases is relatively well described. Several animal models of autoimmune blistering diseases have been established that helped to uncover the immunological and molecular mechanisms underlying the blistering phenotypes. Each in vivo model focuses on specific aspects of the autoimmune cascade, from loss of immunological tolerance on the level of T and B cells to the pathogenic effects of autoantibodies upon binding to their target autoantigen. We discuss current mouse models of autoimmune blistering diseases, including models of pemphigus vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, and dermatitis herpetiformis.

Carbamazepine (HLA-B, HLA-A) — genotype-based safety and use guidance: US Food and Drug Administration approved labeling recommends to avoid using carbamazepine on the basis of the HLA-B✱15:02 and HLA-A✱31:01 genotypes, where data support or indicate a potential effect on drug safety. HLA-B✱15:02 genotype increases risk for Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and the HLA-A✱31:01 genotype increases risk for SJS, TEN, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and maculopapular exanthema. Recommendations based on the 2017 Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guideline state that if HLA-B✱15:02 and/or HLA-A✱31:01 genotypes are present, do not use carbamazepine for naive patients or cautiously consider using it if previously used consistently for > 3 months, and if alternative agents are not available and the patient is positive for HLA-A✱31:01, consider using carbamazepine with increased clinical monitoring.

### Oral lesions in autoimmune bullous diseases: an overview of clinical characteristics and diagnostic algorithm [^939bbad3]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune bullous diseases are a group of chronic inflammatory disorders caused by autoantibodies targeted against structural proteins of the desmosomal and hemidesmosomal plaques in the skin and mucosa, leading to intra-epithelial or subepithelial blistering. The oral mucosa is frequently affected in these diseases, in particular, in mucous membrane pemphigoid, pemphigus vulgaris, and paraneoplastic pemphigus. The clinical symptoms are heterogeneous and may present with erythema, blisters, erosions, and ulcers localized anywhere on the oral mucosa, and lead to severe complaints for the patients including pain, dysphagia, and foetor. Therefore, a quick and proper diagnosis with adequate treatment is needed. Clinical presentations of autoimmune bullous diseases often overlap and diagnosis cannot be made based on clinical features alone. Immunodiagnostic tests are of great importance in differentiating between the different diseases. Direct immunofluorescence microscopy shows depositions of autoantibodies along the epithelial basement membrane zone in mucous membrane pemphigoid subtypes, or depositions on the epithelial cell surface in pemphigus variants. Additional immunoserological tests are useful to discriminate between the different subtypes of pemphigoid, and are essential to differentiate between pemphigus and paraneoplastic pemphigus. This review gives an overview of the clinical characteristics of oral lesions and the diagnostic procedures in autoimmune blistering diseases, and provides a diagnostic algorithm for daily practice.

### Epidermolysis bullosa. I. molecular genetics of the junctional and hemidesmosomal variants [^46788ca7]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Epidermolysis bullosa (EB), a group of autosomal heritable blistering diseases, is characterised by extensive phenotypic variability with considerable morbidity and mortality. EB is classified into distinct subtypes depending on the location of blistering within the cutaneous dermoepidermal basement membrane zone. Ten genes are known to harbour mutations in the major types of EB, and the level of expression of these genes within the cutaneous basement membrane zone and in extracutaneous tissues, as well as the types and combinations of the mutations, explain in general terms the phenotypic variability.

Methods

The DebRA Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory, established in 1996 and supported in part by the patient advocacy organisation DebRA of America, has analysed over 1000 families with different forms of EB.

Results

In total, 265 cases were submitted with the preliminary diagnosis of junctional or hemidesmosomal forms of EB. We found 393 mutant alleles in seven different genes, with 173 of the mutations being distinct and 71 previously unpublished.

Discussion

These findings attest to the clinical and molecular heterogeneity of the junctional and hemidesmosomal subtypes of EB. The results also reveal exceptions to the general rules on genotype-phenotype correlations, unusual phenotypes, and surprising genetics. Collectively, mutation analysis in different forms of EB provides the basis for improved classification with prognostic implications and for prenatal and preimplantation diagnosis in families at risk for recurrence of EB.

### Diagnostic accuracy of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) to detect anti-skin autoantibodies in autoimmune blistering skin diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^05dc959f]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Systematic reviews and meta-analysis are essential tools to accurately and reliably summarize evidence, and can be used as a starting point for developing practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of patients.

Aim

To estimate the diagnostic accuracy of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) to detect anti-BP180 and anti-desmoglein 3 (Dsg3) autoantibodies in the diagnosis of autoimmune blistering skin diseases.

Methods

A Medline search of English written articles, published between 1994 and 2011, reporting data on the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tests was conducted using the following search terms: "BP180 autoantibodies", "Dsg3 autoantibodies", and "enzyme linked immunosorbent assay". The selected articles have been evaluated according to the quality of the statistical methods used to calculate diagnostic accuracy (definition of cutoff value, use of ROC curves, and selection of control cases). The meta-analysis was performed using a summary ROC (SROC) curve and a random-effect model to independently combine sensitivity and specificity across studies.

Results

The search yielded 69 publications on BP180 autoantibodies and 178 on Dsg3 autoantibodies. A total of 30 studies met the inclusion criteria: 17 provided data on the assays to detect autoantibodies to BP180 in a sample of 583 patients with bullous pemphigoid (BP), while 13 studies provided data on the assays to search for anti-Dsg3 autoantibodies in a sample of 1058 patients with pemphigus vulgaris (PV). The 17 studies on BP180 autoantibodies yielded a pooled sensitivity of 0.87 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 0.89) and a pooled specificity of 0.98 (CI, 0.98 to 0.99). The area under the curve (AUC) for the SROC curve was 0.988, and the summary diagnostic odds ratio was 374.91 (CI, 249.97 to 562.30). The 13 studies on Dsg3 autoantibodies which met the inclusion criteria, yielded a pooled sensitivity of 0.97 (CI, 0.95 to 0.98), and a pooled specificity of 0.98 (CI, 0.98 to 0.99). The AUC for the SROC curve was 0.995 and the summary diagnostic odds ratio was 1466.11 (95% CI, 750.36 to 2864.61).

Conclusions

Results of the meta-analysis demonstrated that ELISA tests for anti-BP180 and anti-Dsg3 autoantibodies have high sensitivity and specificity for BP and PV, respectively, and can be used in daily laboratory practice for the initial diagnosis of autoimmune blistering skin diseases.

### Disseminated tense bullae on newborn [^3a96ef23]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Impetigo bullosa
B. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex
C. Diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis (DCM)
D. Staphylococcal-scalded skin syndrome
E. Erythema multiforme

Answers:
A. Impetigo bullosa – Incorrect. Impetigo bullosa is a skin infection caused mainly by Staphylococcus aureus, with the rare appearance of intact vesicles or bullae. Typically, the lesions are copious, especially in the mouth and nose regions. Confirmation of the diagnosis can be obtained with Gram stain and culture.
B. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex – Incorrect. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex is one of the main types of bullous epidermolysis, which is represented by fragility of the skin, and due to minor mechanical trauma, nonscarring blisters and erosions are formed. Its diagnosis is established through molecular genetic testing and skin biopsy.
C. DCM – Correct. DCM is characterized by generalized infiltration of mast cells in the skin, with frequent formation of bullae. Bullous lesions are frequently observed, with reports of bullous lesion involvement in 62% to 69% of the patients, and may even be the first presentation of DCM. Bullae appear mainly on the trunk, scalp, and extremities, developing into erosions and thickening of the skin. Clinically, patients have pruritus, generalized erythema, pachydermia, and a darker skin color compared with that of normal-appearing skin. In order to assist the diagnosis, histologic examinations are typically performed. Frequent follow up and proper treatment are essential for significant improvement in overall clinical outcomes and disease control. Treatments include the use of antihistamines, systemic and topical corticosteroids, and mast cell stabilizers.
D. Staphylococcal-scalded skin syndrome – Incorrect. Staphylococcal-scalded skin syndrome is a cutaneous infection that can cause bullae and erosions in newborns. The risk of skin infection is greater for premature and immunosuppressed newborns. Antibiotic therapy is administered in cases of suspected staphylococcal-scalded skin syndrome, in which thorough hygiene measures should be taken until the results of the tests are available. Its diagnosis is established by culture and sensitivity evaluation.
E. Erythema multiforme – Incorrect. Erythema multiforme is a disease that manifests through blisters, macules, papules, and plaques on the body and that is caused by a reaction to infection or medication. In particular, there are often acral lesions, which can appear first on the limbs, head, and neck and subsequently spread elsewhere. Its diagnosis can be confirmed by clinical findings and histopathologic tests.

### A comprehensive next-generation sequencing assay for the diagnosis of epidermolysis bullosa [^62a5d201]. Pediatric Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Historically, diagnosis of epidermolysis bullosa has required skin biopsies for electron microscopy, direct immunofluorescence to determine which gene(s) to choose for genetic testing, or both.

Methods

To avoid these invasive tests, we developed a high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based diagnostic assay called EBSEQ that allows simultaneous detection of mutations in 21 genes with known roles in epidermolysis bullosa pathogenicity. Mutations are confirmed with traditional Sanger sequencing.

Results

We present our EBSEQ assay and preliminary studies on the first 43 subjects tested. We identified 11 cases of epidermolysis bullosa simplex, five cases of junctional epidermolysis bullosa, 11 cases of dominant dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, 15 cases of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, and one case that remains without diagnosis. We also found an additional 52 variants of uncertain clinical significance in 17 of the 21 epidermolysis bullosa-associated genes tested. Three of the variants of uncertain clinical significance were also found in three other patients, for a total of 49 unique variants of uncertain clinical significance. We found the clinical sensitivity of the assay to be 75% to 98% and the analytical sensitivity to be 99% in identifying base substitutions and small deletions and duplications. Turnaround time was 3 to 6 weeks.

Conclusions

EBSEQ is a sensitive, relatively rapid, minimally invasive, comprehensive genetic assay for the diagnosis of epidermolysis bullosa.

### Exuberant scale crust of the scalp [^6f384589]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Question 2: Which of the following is not a mainstay for management of this condition?
A. Rituximab
B. Prednisone
C. Azathioprine
D. Mycophenolate mofetil
E. Etanercept
Anwers:
A. Rituximab – Incorrect. Rituximab is among the most common drugs used in treatment of pemphigus.
B. Prednisone – Incorrect. Prednisone is among the most common drugs used in treatment of pemphigus.
C. Azathioprine – Incorrect. Azathioprine is among the most common drugs used in treatment of pemphigus. Many clinicians consider azathioprine the immunosuppressant drug of choice because of its long history of use.
D. Mycophenolate mofetil – Incorrect. Mycophenolate mofetil is among the most common drugs used in combination with glucocorticoids for patients with pemphigus.
E. Etanercept – Correct. The use of etanercept has been piloted with a very few patients, and the effect was found to be inconclusive.

Question 3: Findings from which of the following additional laboratory studies, if any, would be the most supportive of the suspected diagnosis?
A. Rheumatoid factor (RF)
B. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) testing for Dsg3 and Dsg1 autoantibodies
C. ELISA testing for BP180 and BP230 autoantibodies
D. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate
E. None of the above
Anwers:
A. RF – Incorrect. RF may be useful in the setting of psoriatic arthritis (ie, to work up possible rheumatoid arthritis), but this laboratory study does not have utility in this setting.
B. ELISA testing for desmoglein (DSG) 3 and DSG1 autoantibodies – Correct. This is the test of choice in supporting the diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris. IgG autoantibodies to DSGs are detected via ELISA in patients with pemphigus, and expression of these autoantibodies often correlates with the disease.
C. ELISA testing for BP180 and BP230 autoantibodies – Incorrect. ELISA testing for BP180 and BP230 autoantibodies is helpful in the setting of bullous pemphigoid.
D. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate – Incorrect. This is too nonspecific to support a diagnosis and is expected to be elevated in an inflammatory disease.
E. None of the above – Incorrect. Given the suspected diagnosis of pemphigus, ELISA testing for DSG3 and DSG1 autoantibodies can be a supportive laboratory test.

### Doxycycline versus prednisolone as an initial treatment strategy for bullous pemphigoid: a pragmatic, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial [^08f2a671]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We updated a Cochrane systematic review of interventions for bullous pemphigoid in 2010 (no language restrictions) and found ten randomised controlled studies, only one of which (20 participants) tested use of tetracyclines — despite their widespread use. We searched the Cochrane Library and PubMed for publications from Aug 1, 2010, to Nov 1, 2016, using the term "pemphigoid" and did not find any new trials of tetracyclines for bullous pemphigoid. The most substantial advance in pemphigoid treatment in the last 10 years has been the demonstration of good response rates for superpotent and potent topical corticosteroids applied to the whole body for prolonged periods with substantial reduction in mortality when compared with oral prednisolone. Use of topical steroid treatment is partly limited by side-effects such as skin thinning and practical considerations such as reduced mobility or lack of carer support to enable elderly patients to apply whole body ointments daily, so there is still a need for an oral treatment for bullous pemphigoid that is safer than prednisolone.

Added value of this study

Our study provides new information that supports our hypothesis that starting patients with bullous pemphigoid on oral doxycycline 200 mg per day produces acceptable blister control in the short term (within our a-priori non-inferiority limits), with better long-term safety than starting on prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg per day. We did not find any evidence that the treatment response differed between the two strategies according to the severity of blisters at baseline. The relative trade-off of blister control versus long-term safety provides key information for shared decision making between patients with bullous pemphigoid and doctors.

Interpretation of all the available evidence

Topical corticosteroid treatment still probably offers the best trade-off between blister control and long-term safety when compared with oral prednisolone, but prolonged whole body topical treatment might not always be practical in some patients, such as the elderly. In individuals with bullous pemphigoid who need oral therapy, our study suggests that initiating treatment with doxycycline might produce acceptable blister control and better long-term safety than standard treatment with oral prednisolone.

### Advancements in bullous pemphigoid treatment: a comprehensive pipeline update [^40f60e14]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Total IgE and eosinophils were frequently found to be elevated at the start of therapy, with a rapid reduction of eosinophils after therapy, and a slower, sometimes undetectable, reduction in IgE (probably due to the formation of immunocomplexes between the drug and IgEs that have a slower clearance). However, other studies demonstrated no correlation between response to omalizumab and eosinophil or IgE levels in blood. Indeed, omalizumab may also show efficacy in patients without detectable serum anti-BP180/BP230 IgE. Responders show a decrease in IgE skin deposition, circulating IgG autoantibody levels, and basophils, suggesting immune-modulatory effects beyond IgE inhibition. After 4 weeks of omalizumab, there is a significant reduction of IgE+ and FceRI+ cells in the dermis in immunohistochemistry stainings. That is to say, only a subset of BP patients responds favorably to omalizumab treatment and lesional IgE and FceRI expression might be useful to distinguish this subset of patients who will benefit from omalizumab therapy.

Materials and methods

Identification of relevant studies and data extraction

This study was designed according to the Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. We searched PubMed, Wiley Online Library, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang database for studies associated with the following Medical Subject Heading terms: (i) 'pemphigus'; and (ii) 'human leukocyte antigen', 'HLA', 'major histocompatibility complex', 'MHC' or 'DRB1'. No restrictions were placed on language, patient age, sex or study design. All publications were searched up to 30 September 2011. In addition, the reference lists of all electronically identified studies and reviews were manually searched. All referenced dissertations and digests of conferences were retrieved. If additional studies or obscure data were suggested in any of the retrieved literature, the cited experts were contacted to obtain any additional sources of relevant data.

Two investigators (L.Y. and J-M.W.) independently reviewed all abstracts for study relevance, retrieved the selected full texts, extracted data using a standardized form, and assessed study quality. Disagreements were resolved by discussion and by consulting a third investigator (K.Z.). Studies were selected according to the following inclusion criteria: (i) an independent case–control design; (ii) primary study (not re-analysis or review) in English or Chinese; (iii) sufficient information to calculate the odds ratio (OR); (iv) unrelated cases and controls; (v) molecular-type detection methods (including high or low resolution level); and (vi) definite diagnosis of PV, based on histopathology or immunopatho-logy. In addition, studies were excluded based on the following features: (i) incomplete raw data; (ii) repetitive reporting of a dataset (for which, the most recent report was selected for inclusion); (iii) insufficient materials and methods; (iv) exclusive focus on haplotype or single nucleotide polymorphism; or (v) exclusive focus on HLA-DR4 or DR14.

The following information was collected from each of the selected studies: authors, publication year, ethnicity of study population, detection assay type, PV diagnostic criteria, and numbers of cases and controls for each genetic variation. The genetic data were categorized as allelic data (allele counts of a locus in the certain diploid species) or phenotype data (number of individuals positive for a given allele, regardless of heterozygosity or homozygosity).

### Autoimmune blistering diseases: histologic meaning [^7c90d2f7]. Clinics in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

The histologic picture of intraepidermal and subepidermal autoimmune bullous dermatoses is presented. Histologic changes are described according to the temporal evolution of lesions, with special reference to crucial elements of the histologic differential diagnosis. The diagnosis of autoimmune bullous dermatoses is complex, mostly requiring additional immunofluorescence assays along with histoclinical correlation to detect the antibodies or target antigen by the methods of molecular biology or immunohistochemistry. Additional tests to reach an accurate diagnosis in various autoimmune bullous dermatoses are briefly described, emphasizing the need of proper integration of all clinical and laboratory data. Although frequently inadequately specific, the histologic finding provides a link between clinical findings and target molecular studies in autoimmune bullous dermatoses.

### Severe bullous pemphigoid with excoriation disorder [^d9e2f2e2]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Bullous pemphigoid is the most common autoimmune blistering skin disease. Pathogenesis involves autoantibodies that attack the basement membrane, resulting in blisters and intense pruritus. We present a case of bullous pemphigoid with concurrent excoriation disorder in a woman in her 50s. The suspected diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid was confirmed through direct immunofluorescence testing on a specimen obtained via punch biopsy, then treated with vancomycin and steroids. In addition, cross tapering from duloxetine to fluoxetine was used to treat the patient's excoriation disorder. The concurrent dermatological and psychiatric components, as well as the severity, made this case unique.

### Bullous pemphigoid severity and levels of antibodies to BP180 and BP230: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^618b1a3a]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

The correlation between serum levels of autoantibodies against bullous pemphigoid (BP) antigens 180 (BP180) and 230 (BP230) with BP disease severity is unclear.

Objective

To investigate the correlation of anti-BP180 and anti-BP230 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels with BP disease severity.

Data Sources

A search was performed of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, and PubMed databases from their respective inception to April 11, 2024.

Study Selection

Studies evaluating the correlation between serum levels of anti-BP180 or anti-BP230 IgG measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and disease severity assessed per the Autoimmune Bullous Skin Disorder Intensity Score (ABSIS) or BP Disease Area Index (BPDAI) were included. No language or geographic restrictions were imposed. Nearly 0.4% of initially identified studies met the selection criteria.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

One researcher extracted data and another researcher confirmed data. The risk of bias was independently assessed by these researchers using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tool, with discrepancies resolved by discussion with a third researcher. A random-effects model meta-analysis and a subgroup analysis were conducted based on the ELISA kit manufacturers.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Pooled correlation coefficients of antibody levels with ABSIS and BPDAI.

Results

In all, 14 studies with 1226 participants were analyzed. The risk of bias of included studies was generally low. The meta-analysis found anti-BP180 autoantibody levels showed moderate correlation with objective BPDAI (r = 0.56; 95% CI, 0.46–0.64) at baseline, strong correlation (r = 0.63; 95% CI, 0.39–0.79) at 3-month follow-up, and moderate correlation (r = 0.53; 95% CI, 0.25–0.72) at 6-month follow-up. Anti-BP180 autoantibody levels also showed moderate correlation (r = 0.52; 95% CI, 0.39–0.62) with ABSIS at baseline, strong correlation (r = 0.62; 95% CI, 0.39–0.79) at 3-month follow-up, and moderate correlation (r = 0.53; 95% CI, 0.25–0.72) at 6-month follow-up. By contrast, anti-BP230 autoantibody levels showed no association with objective BPDAI and ABSIS at diagnosis and follow-up. The subgroup analysis found similar results when using different ELISA kits.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis indicated that anti-BP180 autoantibody levels may serve as an adjunctive tool for monitoring BP disease severity and guiding clinical care for patients with BP.

### Pembrolizumab-induced bullous pemphigoid [^6246fe6d]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Case 1

An 86-year-old woman had metastatic melanoma diagnosed in March 2017. The first cycle of pembrolizumab, 200 mg infusion, was given in April 2017 and then every 3 weeks. In August 2018, a pruritic, erythematous, vesicular eruption developed on her bilateral upper extremities. Treatment with betamethasone, 0.05% ointment 2 times daily, and antihistamines was initiated. A 4-mm punch biopsy of a lesion on her back found a subepidermal bulla with eosinophils consistent with BP. Treatment with betamethasone 0.05% cream and pembrolizumab was continued until acute worsening 1 month later. Scattered erythematous plaques with bullae on an erythematous background developed on her chest, back, and arms. She also reported severe pruritus. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing was positive for BP180 IgG and negative for BP230 IgG. Treatment with prednisone, 60 mg with slow taper, was initiated, and pembrolizumab was discontinued. The patient responded well to treatment with resolution of bullous lesions 3 months later, while still on a weaning dose of prednisone.

### Blistering skin diseases: a bridge between dermatopathology and molecular biology [^7568c4ad]. Histopathology (2010). Low credibility.

Although dermatopathology and molecular biology are often considered to be separate laboratory disciplines, the respective approaches are far from mutually exclusive. This is certainly the case for understanding the pathology of blistering skin diseases, both acquired and inherited. For example, in toxic epidermal necrolysis, dermatopathology in isolation may provide few clues to disease pathogenesis. There is widespread keratinocyte apoptosis and a variable infiltrate of cytotoxic T cells, but morphology alone offers little insight into what causes the epidermal destruction. In contrast, molecular biology studies have revealed several key processes that help explain the keratinocyte death, including increased expression of death receptors and their ligands on keratinocyte cell membranes as well as the presence of local or systemic immunocyte-derived cytolytic granules. For some inherited blistering diseases, however, such as epidermolysis bullosa, the molecular pathology is complex and difficult to unravel in isolation, yet the addition of dermatopathology is helpful in focusing molecular investigations. Notably, immunolabelling of cell adhesion proteins using specific antibody probes can identify reduced or absent immunoreactivity for candidate genes/proteins. Bridging dermatopathology and molecular biology investigations facilitates a greater understanding of disease processes, improves diagnostic accuracy, and provides a basis for the development and appraisal of new treatments.

Separation is through the lamina lucida of the BMZ in JEB subtypes due to pathogenic variants in the genes encoding laminin‐332, α6β4 integrin or type XVII collagen. 85, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95 Of note, pathogenic variants in type XVII collagen and the β4 integrin subunit can exceptionally be associated with intraepidermal cleavage, 96, 97 and the split is usually undetectable in JEB–laryngo‐onycho‐cutaneous syndrome. 98 JEB hemidesmosomes are usually hypoplastic and reduced in number, although they can appear normal in both structure and number, particularly in mild cases of JEB due to laminin‐332 or type XVII collagen gene pathogenic variants. 90, 92, 93, 94, 95, 99, 100

RDEB generalized severe shows rudimentary or absent anchoring fibrils, in addition to subepidermal blistering. 85, 101 Variably hypoplastic anchoring fibrils are usually observed also in the other RDEBs, and in dominant DEB subtypes. Finally, bullous dermolysis of the newborn is characterized by the presence of pathognomonic membrane‐bound inclusions containing amorphous material and rod‐like structures, named stellate bodies, in basal keratinocytes. 102, 103, 104

The cleavage plane in KS may vary, being located either within the epidermis or the lamina lucida or beneath the lamina densa, with multiple separation levels frequently visible in the same specimen. Other characteristic findings include extensive reduplications of the lamina densa. 105

As discussed earlier regarding the limitations of IFM and TEM, when neither blistering nor any typical finding can be detected by both IFM and TEM examination, genetic testing should be performed.

✓ TEM is presently still an important method for the early diagnosis of a limited number of EB subtypes, in particular EBS generalized severe, autosomal recessive EBS caused by EXPH5 or DST1, and, possibly, bullous dermolysis of the newborn. In these subtypes, IFM may not be able to provide a clear result. Thus, the early detection of specific ultrastructural features has direct prognostic and management implications.

✓ In cases in which VUS or no clear pathogenic variants are identified by genetic testing, TEM may provide valuable information on the underlying ultrastructural anomalies. 59

### BP230-and BP180-specific auto-antibodies in bullous pemphigoid [^8a826b01]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Bullous pemphigoid is a subepidermal blistering disease associated with auto-antibodies (auto-ab) to BP180 and BP230. We developed ELISAs utilizing baculovirus-encoded recombinant proteins of BP230 and BP180 and studied their diagnostic and prognostic values by assessing the profile of the auto-ab response in 127 patients with BP. 39 patients had focal involvement, whereas 88 had generalized disease; 51 individuals served as controls. The results indicate: (1) BP180 IgG reactivity was associated with an overall sensitivity of 0.953 and specificity of 0.940; (2) 105 of 127 BP patients also displayed BP230 auto-reactivity, the global diagnostic performance of which, however, was moderate compared to BP180-auto-reactivity (sensitivity 0.815 vs 0.953, specificity 0.648 vs 0.940); (3) 101 patients (79.5%) had concordant BP180 and BP230 reactivity; (4) the association between the presence of BP230 auto-reactivity and focal involvement was stronger than in generalized disease (odds ratio (OR) 17.7 vs 10.2), independently from BP180 auto-ab profile; (5) correlation of total IgG with IgG1 and IgG4 was variable for both BP180 and BP230. Collectively, the global diagnostic properties of the BP180-ELISA outperform those of the BP230-ELISA. Presence of BP230 auto-reactivity, however, supports the diagnosis of BP and might be indicative for the extent of the disease.

### Molecular consequences of deletion of the cytoplasmic domain of bullous pemphigoid 180 in a patient with predominant features of epidermolysis bullosa simplex [^5ec85b04]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Bullous pemphigoid antigen 2 (BP180; COL17A1) collagen gene mutations typically result in nonlethal junctional epidermolysis bullosa. We have identified a patient, who had phenotypic features of mainly epidermolysis bullosa simplex and evidence for both intraepidermal and junctional blister formation. Mutation analysis disclosed compound heterozygous mutations in the COL17A1 gene, leading to deletion of Ile-18 to Asn-407 from the intracellular domain of BP180, BP180 Delta 18–407. To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying the phenotype, we have investigated the functional consequences of this truncation in BP180. The results demonstrate that: (1) in cultured keratinocytes of the patient, the assembly of hemidesmosomes, and their linkage with intermediate filaments are impaired; (2) BP180 Delta 18–407 is not capable of binding to the hemidesmosomal components BP230, plectin, and the beta 4 subunit of the alpha 6 beta 4 integrin in yeast two-hybrid assays; (3) BP180 Delta 18–407 is recruited into hemidesmosome-like structures in both normal and BP180-deficient transfected keratinocytes when ectopically expressed, suggesting that the extracellular domain of BP180 Delta 18–407 determines its topogenic fate; and, finally (4) the proteolytic shedding of the extracellular domain of BP180 Delta 18–407 is not impaired in transfected COS-7 cells. Collectively, the data demonstrate that the truncation of the intracellular domain of BP180 impairs the organization of hemidesmosomes, affecting both the mechanical stability of basal keratinocytes and dermoepidermal cohesion.

### Brunsting-perry pemphigoid transitioning from previous bullous pemphigoid [^3385e8c1]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 63-year-old Chinese man was referred to our hospital in August 2013 with a 3-month history of pruritic lesions. Scattered tense vesicles and bullae appeared on his hands (Fig 1, A), upper limbs, and trunk. The patient received a skin biopsy, which showed a subepidermal bulla as well as superficial inflammation in the upper dermis, with eosinophil infiltration. Direct immunofluorescence studies showed linear deposition of IgG and C3 along the basement membrane zone of the peribullous area. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for IgG antibodies against the BP180 NC16A domain resulted in a value of 90.44 (index > 15: positive) and of 33.75 (index > 9: positive) for BP230 (Fig 1, B). In accordance with the typical clinical features, immunopathologic findings, and specific antibodies, he received a diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid and was treated with 30 mg prednisone per day. The skin lesions gradually subsided, and prednisone was tapered and finally stopped after 2 years. After the patient stopped receiving prednisone, he experienced occasional recurrences that were quickly relieved with topical steroids.

### Assessing the use of dupilumab in a pediatric patient with bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma [^08f57014]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 22-month-old girl presented to our dermatology clinic with a history of a generalized, scaly, pruritic eruption with diffuse erythema and crusted erosions. Her background medical history was notable for spontaneous vaginal delivery at full term to nonconsanguineous parents. Her history was also notable for a 2-week stay in the neonatal intensive care unit for erythroderma with diffuse erosions. She had no known drug allergies and had no other medical or relevant family history. She was initially managed as a case of presumed congenital ichthyosis while genetic testing was pending. She received oral antihistamines, wound care, topical emollients, corticosteroids, and a trial of urea cream 10% with 5% lactic acid, which was discontinued because of irritation.

Genetic testing confirmed a heterozygous mutation of the KRT10 gene on chromosome 17q21.2, thus confirming the diagnosis of BCIE. The parents declined parental segregation analysis and genetic counseling. Her topical regimen barely improved her condition by follow-up, and her mother continued to endorse pruritus.

At 3 years of age, the patient was started on off-label dupilumab at 300 mg/mo for her uncontrolled pruritus. Systemic retinoids were considered; however, because of the risk of skin fragility, we elected to postpone treatment until a later stage.

Pretreatment assessment revealed a height of 0.92 m, weight of 14.1 kg, and stable vitals. Skin examination showed scattered, hyperkeratotic, scaly, "cobblestone-like" plaques, with crusted erosions and desquamation on a background of erythema throughout her skin (Fig 1). She had an affected body surface area of > 90%, with an Ichthyosis Scoring System score of 4.885 and parent-proxy Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale score (NRS) of 10. There were no eclabium, ectropion, palmoplantar keratoderma, joint contractures, epidermal nevi, gait, or postural abnormalities noted on examination.

### Immune modules to guide diagnosis and personalized treatment of inflammatory skin diseases [^54b8e39b]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Patients and Biopsies

The study was approved by the institutional review board of the Lausanne University Hospital CHUV Switzerland and the local ethics committee (Commission cantonale d'éthique de la recherche sur l'être humain, CER-VD), in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and were reviewed by the ethical committee board of the canton of Vaud, Switzerland. 264 patients with inflammatory skin diseases undergoing routine diagnostic skin biopsies at the Department of Dermatology in Lausanne were included in the study (Suppl. Table 4). Frozen biopsies from consented patients were deposited into the Swiss Biobanking Platform (SBP)-accredited Dermatology biobank before analysis. The median age of patients was 58 (range 19–95) and 36% were women (Suppl. Table 5). We included biopsies of 12 common inflammatory skin diseases from untreated patients with psoriasis (n = 58), AD (n = 66), LP (n = 18), cutaneous LE (n = 19), Wells syndrome (n = 3), bullous pemphigoid (n = 17), drug hypersensitivity reaction (n = 10), hidradenitis suppurativa (n = 5), pyoderma gangrenosum (n = 5), Sweet syndrome (n = 2), and dissecting cellulitis (n = 3). To construct the molecular cartography, we selected patients for sentinel biopsies according to the following criteria: psoriasis patients having chronic plaque-type psoriasis, diagnosed clinically according to standard morphological criteria and confirmed by histopathology; atopic dermatitis patients with clinically-well defined disease, confirmed by histopathology and history of atopy with elevated blood IgE levels; lichen planus patients having classical cutaneous lichen planus diagnosed clinically, confirmed by histopathology with presence of civatte bodies on direct immunofluorescence; cutaneous lupus erythematosus patients having either discoid or subacute cutaneous LE, diagnosed clinically and confirmed by histopathology, with presence of a lupus band on direct immunofluorescence; patients with Sweet syndrome, hidradenitis suppurativa, pyoderma gangrenosum, dissecans cellulitis (all neutrophilic dermatoses) as well as wells syndrome, selected according to classical clinical criteria and confirmed by histopathology; bullous pemphigoid patients diagnosed clinically and confirmed by histopathology with positive direct immunofluorescence and serological testing for anti-BP180/230; drug hypersensitivity reactions (DHR) patients presenting with maculo-papular eruptions and having a history of specific drug intake, confirmed by histopathology and in-vivo skin tests or ex-vivo blood testing for drug hypersensitivity.

### Evaluation of clinical criteria for diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid… [^5046df76]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

Setting Five dermatology departments in teaching hospitals. Patients The 231 patients studied had subepidermal autoimmune bullous diseases with linear IgG or C3 deposits in the basement membrane zone. A second set of patients was used to calculate predictive values. Results The multivariate logistic stepwise analysis resulted in a final set of predictors that included only 4 items: absence of atrophic scars, absence of head and neck involvement, absence of mucosal involvement, and age greater than 70 years. No additional variables met the. 05 significance level to enter into the model. If 3 of these 4 characteristics were present, a diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid could be made with a sensitivity of 90% and a specifity of 83%; these predictive values were calculated on a sample of 70 new cases.

Conclusions With an estimated incidence of bullous pemphigoid among subepidermal autoimmune bullous diseases of 80%, the presence of 3 of the 4 significant criteria allows the diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid, with a positive predictive value of 95%. Our set of' clinical criteria thus allows the diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid with good validity for both clinical practice and therapeutic trials. All patients who had newly diagnosed subepidermal autoimmune disease were included in this prospective study. They were examined in 5 departments of dermatology from 1983 to 1989. Criteria for enrollment were age greater than 18 years, presence of bullous dermatosis, subepidermal blister in hematoxylin-eosin examination of biopsy specimens, and presence of linear IgG or C3 deposits in the BMZ of perilesional skin detected by direct immunofluorescence.

The characteristics used as independent variables were age, presence of erythematous plaques, hypereosinophilia, anti-BMZ antibodies, absence of atrophic scar mucosal involvement, head and neck involvement, epidermal cysts, and mechanical blisters. For all these characteristics, subsequently used to determine a set of diagnostic criteria, the differences between the 2 groups were significant at P <. 001, except for the criterion of anti-BMZ antibodies, which was significant at P <. 01.

### Bullous pemphigoid triggered by COVID-19 vaccine: rapid resolution with corticosteroid therapy [^84fedb2d]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an acquired autoimmune blistering disease characterized by autoantibodies against basement membrane zone antigens. Several trigger factors have been identified for this disorder, such drugs, ultraviolet radiation, trauma and burns. Pemphigoid cases have been reported in association with vaccination, including rabies, influenza, pnuemococcus, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, poliomyelitis Heaemophilus influenzae B, hepatitis B and Meningococcus Cvaccine, indicating that vaccination can trigger pemphigoid.

We report here a case of a 83‐year‐old man with a 30 days history of multiple erythemas and blisters with itching. The patient has been affected with hypertension for 20 years, for which he was in treatment with perindopril 10 mg DIE and amlodipine 5 mg DIE. He was otherwise in quite good health with no other significant medical conditions. His family history was negative for significant diseases and skin disorders. The patient developed the first bullous lesions 1 week after the first dose of Comirnaty (Pfizer–BioNTech COVID‐19 vaccine). Blisters were few and located only on his legs and they were initially misdiagnosed as post‐traumatic lesions by his general practitioner. Three days after the second dose of vaccine, which was administrated 1 month after the first, the patient started developing new blisters on his limbs and trunk. When he was eventually admitted to our department he presented several erosions and tense bullae on erythematous base measuring 4–11 cm in diameter on trunk and limbs (Figure 1A). Nikolsky sign was absent and the remainder of the physical examination was normal. Blood exams were carried out, including routine clinical chemistry, neoplastic markers, viral hepatitis markers, autoimmunity panel and quantiferon test. All were within normal limits. Tzank test performed from a fresh bulla showed eosinophils. Histopathology from a bullous lesion demonstrated subepidermal blister with occasional lymphocytes and eosinophilis. Direct immunofluorescence revealed a linear band of C3 along the basement membrane. A diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid was made and the patient treated with topical steroids and prednisone 30 mg daily (0.5 mg/kg daily) for 4 weeks, then reduced by 5 mg every week, then stop. A complete resolution of the blisters was obtained after only 3 weeks of treatment (Figure 1B).
