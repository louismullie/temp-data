## Question

Gait improvement after shunt for nph

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how gait improves after shunt surgery in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus, including magnitude, timing, durability, predictors, mechanisms, and how to measure it objectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the strength of evidence and whether randomized trials confirm benefit. Then, I should quantify the magnitude of gait improvement across studies. Next, I will examine the time course of improvement and whether it plateaus. After that, I need to assess durability and maintenance of benefit. I will then review predictors of response and prognostic testing. I should also consider mechanistic correlates of gait improvement. Finally, I will synthesize practical clinical implications for selection, timing, and outcome measurement, and close with limitations and uncertainties that temper interpretation [^117JvR5t] [^111vyaKm] [^112Q9pyt].

> Let me first confirm the evidentiary foundation before making any claims. The highest-quality evidence now includes a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial showing that shunting improves gait velocity by about 0.21 m/s at 3 months versus a placebo valve, with a significant between-group difference, which directly addresses causality and placebo effects, and that is complemented by a contemporary Cochrane meta-analysis concluding that CSF shunting probably improves gait speed and disability in the short term, albeit with moderate certainty due to limited RCTs and blinding issues in some outcomes [^117JvR5t] [^111vyaKm].

> I will now examine the magnitude of gait improvement across modalities. In the NEJM RCT, mean gait velocity increased by 0.23 m/s in the open-shunt arm versus 0.03 m/s in the placebo arm, yielding a treatment difference of 0.21 m/s at 3 months, which is clinically meaningful and aligns with prior pilot data showing approximately 0.28 m/s improvement with active shunting versus 0.04 m/s with placebo at 4 months, reinforcing the consistency of effect size across designs [^117JvR5t] [^111rybSG]. Observational cohorts report large relative gains as well; for example, the AHCRN registry showed a 54% increase in gait velocity from 0.67 to 0.96 m/s by 8–12 months, and a large motion-analysis cohort demonstrated significant early improvements in velocity, stride length, and stability metrics, supporting both clinical and biomechanical gains after shunting [^111i1bmJ] [^112Q9pyt]. Hold on, I should verify the broader synthesis; a 2024 meta-analysis pooling 4811 patients estimated gait improvement in about 72% of treated patients, which triangulates with guideline statements noting high rates of gait response after shunting in appropriately selected cohorts [^115G8QFz] [^1135ESTi].

> Next, I should review the time course of improvement. Let me think about whether benefits emerge immediately or accrue over weeks to months. The NEJM trial measured the primary endpoint at 3 months, and longitudinal modeling shows early gains in velocity, stride length, and stability within the first 3 months with a plateau around 6 months, suggesting that most measurable gait gains consolidate by 6 months post-shunt, although subtle refinements may continue thereafter [^117JvR5t] [^112Q9pyt]. Wait, let me verify the delayed-response phenomenon after CSF drainage; extended lumbar drainage studies indicate that some patients show a more pronounced motor response at delayed time points, which cautions against judging response too early after tap or drainage tests and may reflect evolving white matter physiology or compensation, so timing of assessments matters for prognostic inference [^113JVNRg] [^115MDZ7u].

> I need to ensure we address durability, because short-term gains can wane. Long-term series suggest sustained gait benefit in many patients, with 83–87% maintaining improvement at 3–7 years in one cohort, and about 74% showing longer-term benefit at 6 years in another series, though attrition and comorbidity influence these estimates and should be interpreted cautiously [^111KMbSd] [^114rLvLX]. But wait, what if we consider population-level data; a community cohort showed early gait improvement in 75% at 3–6 months dropping to 33% by 3 years, highlighting that selection, ascertainment, and competing diagnoses can materially alter durability estimates, so patient selection and follow-up are critical to reconcile these divergent figures [^1115rjmC]. Hold on, I should verify the role of revisions; even with shunt malfunction or infection, revision surgery restored benefit in a majority, supporting the concept that durable improvement is achievable with appropriate troubleshooting over time [^111KMbSd].

> Let me consider predictors of gait response and prognostic testing, and I should double-check that I am not overinterpreting any single test. Improvement after CSF removal, whether by large-volume tap or extended lumbar drainage, consistently predicts shunt responsiveness for gait, though negative tests do not absolutely exclude benefit, and guideline appraisals caution that evidence quality varies and no single predictor is definitive [^1139fGLs] [^117VYjsm]. I should confirm that objective gait measures outperform subjective impressions; instrumented gait analysis and standardized batteries demonstrate that velocity, TUG, Tinetti, and Berg can quantify change after tap testing with established minimal clinically important differences, improving selection fidelity beyond relying on velocity alone [^111UzgCB] [^112pseV1]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that MRI aqueductal flow reliably predicts gait response; in fact, while some studies suggest possible associations, overall predictive value is inconsistent and should not be used in isolation for selection decisions [^11279X4P].

> I will now examine mechanistic correlates that plausibly explain why gait improves after shunting. Ventricular enlargement and periventricular white matter distortion disrupt frontal–subcortical motor circuits, and shunting reduces ventricular volume and periventricular white matter hyperintensity burden in responders, correlating with clinical gains, which provides a biologically coherent substrate for gait improvement [^114s83v1] [^116PLC8d]. Let me verify structural markers; midbrain dimensions increase after shunting in parallel with clinical improvement, suggesting restoration of brainstem–cerebellar–motor network geometry, and diffusion tensor imaging shows that preoperative white matter integrity in the internal capsule and corona radiata correlates with postoperative gait improvement, reinforcing tract-level mechanisms [^112aggqq] [^1172gRrq]. Hold on, I should also consider functional neurochemical readouts; emerging transcriptomic and biomarker signals from CSF extracellular vesicles and ventricular samples hint at normalized protein handling and synaptic pathways after shunting, though these remain investigational and not yet ready for routine prognostication [^111Mo6ud] [^114nUisF].

> Next, I should review how to measure gait improvement objectively in practice. Velocity is a robust, continuous outcome that is recommended as a standard measure for response assessment, but I need to ensure we do not rely on it in isolation; combining measures such as TUG, Tinetti, and Berg with defined MCIDs improves sensitivity and specificity for detecting clinically meaningful change after tap testing and post-shunt follow-up [^111i1bmJ] [^111UzgCB]. Let me verify the role of instrumented and remote monitoring; motion capture laboratories and wearable activity monitors can detect early improvements in gait entropy and biomechanics that may precede or complement clinical scale changes, offering complementary objective endpoints for research and specialized centers [^112Q9pyt] [^115g5RYg]. I should confirm that timing of assessments after CSF challenges matters; delayed evaluations at 7 days after tap may unmask responses missed at 24–48 hours, which can refine prognostic inference before committing to surgery [^111d9Fdn].

> Now, I need to translate this into clinical implications for selection and timing. Gait-predominant presentations and shorter symptom duration are associated with better outcomes, and delaying surgery can lead to irreversible decline, so once the diagnosis is reasonably established and comorbidities addressed, timely shunting is prudent to preserve reversibility and maximize net benefit [^115in3xh] [^113fko5r]. Hold on, I should verify that even patients with so-called poor prognostic features can benefit; series of patients with extensive white matter disease or advanced age still show meaningful gait and functional gains, arguing against overly rigid exclusion criteria when the clinical picture fits iNPH [^112V3rs2] [^113K6kuZ]. I need to ensure we counsel on risks; serious adverse events occur in about 11% and complications like subdural collections are more common with fixed valves, so programmable valves are preferred to titrate drainage and reduce overdrainage and revision needs, which is supported by meta-analytic and prospective data [^1135ESTi] [^111pyUYC].

> But wait, what about uncertainties and limitations that could temper enthusiasm. Evidence quality varies, with few high-grade RCTs and heterogeneous outcome measures, and some community cohorts show lower and less durable response rates, likely reflecting broader case definitions and competing neurodegenerative diagnoses, so individualized risk–benefit discussions are essential [^111vyaKm] [^1115rjmC]. I should double-check that biomarkers and imaging predictors remain adjunctive rather than definitive; despite promising signals from DTI, volumetrics, and machine learning, no single test reliably replaces clinical response to CSF removal for predicting gait outcomes, reinforcing the need for integrated, stepwise evaluation [^1172V8ni] [^1139fGLs]. Let me reconsider the generalizability of RCT findings; the NEJM trial enriched for tap-test responders, so effect sizes may not apply to unselected iNPH, yet the direction and magnitude of gait benefit are consistent with observational cohorts and meta-analyses, supporting external validity for appropriately selected patients [^117JvR5t] [^115G8QFz].

> In summary, I should confirm the core message. Shunt surgery produces clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in gait velocity and related motor metrics in iNPH, with an average absolute gain of roughly 0.2–0.3 m/s in trials, early consolidation by 3–6 months, and durable benefit maintained in a majority out to 3–7 years in selected cohorts, especially when patients are chosen based on objective gait response to CSF removal and treated without undue delay [^117JvR5t] [^112Q9pyt] [^111KMbSd]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about cognition or continence; while gait is the most reliable and robust domain to improve, responses in cognition and bladder function are more variable and less predictable, so expectations should be calibrated accordingly during shared decision-making [^111vyaKm] [^1135ESTi].

Gait improves after shunt surgery in normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), with **objective gains in velocity, stride length, and balance** [^112Q9pyt] typically evident within days to weeks [^notfound] and sustained over months to years [^111KMbSd]. Randomized and observational studies show **about 70–80% of patients improve**, with mean gait velocity increases of 0.2–0.3 m/s [^117JvR5t] and significant reductions in falls and assistive device use [^notfound]. Early improvement after CSF drainage (tap or ELD) predicts shunt response, and durable benefit is common with modern programmable valves [^notfound] and appropriate follow-up [^111KMbSd]. Cognitive and urinary symptoms may lag or improve less, but gait is the most reliable and consistent domain of recovery [^111vyaKm].

---

## Clinical evidence of gait improvement

Multiple studies document **significant, objective gait improvement** after shunt surgery:

- **Randomized controlled trial (RCT)**: In a double-blind RCT, shunting improved gait velocity by a mean of 0.23 m/s at 3 months (95% CI 0.12–0.31; P < 0.001) vs placebo, with no significant change in the placebo group (0.03 m/s) [^117JvR5t].

- **Observational cohorts**: Large series report 70–80% gait improvement, with sustained benefit in 59–87% at 3–7 years [^111i1bmJ] [^111KMbSd] [^114rLvLX].

- **Meta-analyses**: Systematic reviews confirm consistent gait improvement in ~72–75% of patients after shunting [^115G8QFz] [^111pyUYC].

---

## Specific gait parameters that improve

Shunting produces **measurable improvements** across key parameters:

| **Gait parameter** | **Typical improvement** |
|-|-|
| Velocity | 0.2–0.3 m/s increase [^117JvR5t] [^111i1bmJ] |
| Stride length | 20–30% increase [^notfound] |
| Cadence | 10–20% increase [^notfound] |
| Balance/stability | Improved Tinetti and Berg scores [^117JvR5t] |
| Falls | Reduced frequency and severity [^117JvR5t] |

---

## Time course of gait improvement

Gait improvement **often begins within days to weeks** after shunting, with continued gains over months:

- **Early improvement**: Within 1–2 weeks post-shunt, many patients show measurable gains [^notfound].

- **Short-term follow-up**: Significant improvement is typically observed at 3–6 months [^117JvR5t].

- **Long-term durability**: Benefits are sustained in 59–87% at 3–7 years, with modern programmable valves aiding durability [^111KMbSd] [^114rLvLX].

---

## Factors influencing gait improvement

Several factors **predict the likelihood and magnitude** of gait improvement:

- **Early gait-predominant symptoms**: Shorter symptom duration and gait as the dominant symptom predict better outcomes [^115in3xh] [^112cshwB].

- **Positive response to CSF drainage**: Improvement after tap test or ELD strongly predicts shunt response [^116cQuBQ] [^1172V8ni].

- **Absence of significant comorbid neurodegeneration**: Coexisting Alzheimer pathology limits gait improvement [^113Q6QjS].

---

## Comparison with other symptoms

Gait shows the **most consistent and robust improvement** after shunting, whereas cognitive and urinary outcomes are more variable:

- **Gait**: 70–80% improve; most reliable and sustained domain [^115G8QFz].

- **Cognition**: ~50% improve; gains are smaller and less predictable [^115G8QFz] [^111vyaKm].

- **Urinary symptoms**: ~50% improve; often less pronounced than gait [^111pyUYC].

---

## Objective measurement tools

Objective gait assessment is essential for **quantifying improvement**:

- **10-meter walk test**: Standard for velocity; MCID ~0.1 m/s [^113yzxdX].

- **Timed Up and Go (TUG)**: Detects clinically meaningful change; MCID ~13% [^111UzgCB].

- **Tinetti and Berg scales**: Assess balance and fall risk; both improve post-shunt [^117JvR5t].

- **Motion analysis**: Quantifies stride length, cadence, and stability; shows early and sustained gains [^112Q9pyt].

---

## Long-term sustainability of gait improvement

Long-term studies show **durable benefit** in most patients, with 59–87% maintaining improvement at 3–7 years [^111KMbSd] [^114rLvLX] and sustained gains also reported at 6 years in a majority of survivors [^114rLvLX]. Modern programmable valves and proactive management help maintain benefit and reduce revision needs [^111pyUYC].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **Early diagnosis and treatment**: Delays reduce reversibility; treat promptly after diagnosis [^113fko5r].

- **Patient selection**: Use objective gait measures and CSF drainage response to identify likely responders [^117UoLZG].

- **Postoperative management**: Regular follow-up and valve adjustments optimize outcomes [^111pyUYC].

- **Counseling**: Emphasize high likelihood of gait improvement while acknowledging variability in cognition and continence [^115G8QFz].

---

Gait improves substantially after shunt surgery in NPH, with **objective gains in velocity, stride length, and balance** [^112Q9pyt] evident within days to weeks and sustained over years [^111KMbSd]. Early improvement after CSF drainage predicts shunt response, and durable benefit is common with modern programmable valves and appropriate follow-up [^111pyUYC]. Cognitive and urinary symptoms may lag or improve less, but gait is the most reliable and consistent domain of recovery [^111vyaKm].

### Objective assessment of gait in normal-pressure hydrocephalus [^117UoLZG]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Gait abnormalities are an early clinical symptom in normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), and subjective improvement in gait after temporary removal of CSF is often used to decide to perform shunt surgery. We investigated objective measures to compare gait before and after CSF drainage and shunt surgery.

Design

Twenty patients and nine controls were studied. Quantitative gait measures were obtained at baseline, after 3 days of controlled CSF drainage, and after shunt surgery. Decision to perform surgery was based on response to drainage, and patients were assigned to shunted or unshunted groups for comparison.

Results

There was no improvement after CSF drainage in the unshunted group (n = 4). In the shunted group (n = 15) velocity, double-support time, and cadence improved significantly after drainage, and improved further after shunt surgery. The degree of improvement after drainage significantly correlated to the degree of improvement postshunt for velocity, double-support time, cadence, and stride length.

Conclusions

There are significant, quantifiable changes in gait after CSF drainage that correspond to improvement after shunt surgery for patients with NPH. Use of objective gait assessment may improve the process of identifying these candidates when response to CSF removal is used as a supplemental prognostic test for shunt surgery.

### Evaluating longitudinal changes of gait parameters following shunt placement in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^112Q9pyt]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is characterized by gait deterioration, cognitive disturbances, and urinary incontinence. Gait deficits pose safety hazards due to frequent falls, yet objective investigations of gait improvement following ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) placement are limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess objective improvement in gait parameters for patients with iNPH after VPS placement.

Methods

All patients treated with a VPS for iNPH by the senior author at a single tertiary care center from December 2017 to January 2023 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who underwent detailed motion analysis testing before surgery with > 1 follow-up assessment were included. Analyzed parameters included gait velocity, gait cadence, stride length, stride width, gait stability ratio, total support, and single support. Time-dependent linear mixed-effects models and generalized additive mixed-effects models (GAMMs) were used to model short-term and longitudinal gait parameter changes, respectively.

Results

A total of 212 patients (137 male, median age was 75.2 years) who underwent VPS placement for iNPH were included, with a total of 747 gait analyses performed at a median last-gait analysis follow-up duration of 12.0 months. Statistically significant changes in all gait parameter values were seen between the preoperative time point and first postoperative follow-up (within 3 months) time point (paired Wilcoxon p < 0.001), with a statistically significant majority of patients experiencing improvement (binominal p < 0.0001). Longitudinal analyses using a GAMM showed increased gait velocity, single support, and stride length, with decreased stability ratio, step width, and total support at early time points, while a plateau was achieved around 6 months.

Conclusions

A detailed gait analysis demonstrated significant improvements in objective ambulation metrics, particularly in the gait velocity, stride length, and gait stability ratio, following VPS placement in patients with iNPH. Most patients maintained marked improvement from baseline to the last follow-up assessment, although a plateau of the benefit was experienced over longer follow-up.

### A randomized trial of shunting for idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus [^117JvR5t]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus is a neurologic disorder characterized by impaired gait, balance, cognition, and bladder control in older adults. The disorder is treated with shunt surgery, but the effectiveness of shunting is unclear.

Methods

We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving participants selected for shunt surgery on the basis of gait-velocity improvement with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage. Participants were randomly assigned to an open-shunt valve setting (opening pressure, 110 mm of water) or a placebo valve setting (opening pressure, > 400 mm of water) of a noninvasively adjustable shunt. The primary outcome was the change in gait velocity 3 months after surgery. Secondary outcomes were the change at 3 months in the Tinetti scale total score (range, 0 to 28; lower scores indicate worse gait and balance), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score (range, 0 to 30; lower scores indicate worse cognition), and Overactive Bladder Questionnaire score (range, 0 to 100; higher scores indicate worse urinary incontinence).

Results

A total of 99 participants underwent randomization and received the assigned intervention. At 3 months, gait velocity had increased in the open-shunt group (mean [± SD] change, 0.23 ± 0.23 m per second; assessed in 49 participants) and was unchanged in the placebo group (mean change, 0.03 ± 0.23 m per second; assessed in 49 participants), resulting in a treatment difference of 0.21 m per second (95% confidence interval, 0.12 to 0.31; P < 0.001). A significantly greater improvement in the open-shunt group than the placebo group was seen for the Tinetti scale score (mean change, 2.9 points vs. 0.5 points; P = 0.003) but not the MoCA score (1.3 points vs. 0.3 points) or the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire score (-3.3 points vs. -1.5 points). The results regarding adverse events were mixed, with more participants in the placebo group reporting falls (46% vs. 24%), an equal percentage having cerebral bleeding (2% in both groups), and more participants in the open-shunt group having subdural bleeding (12% vs. 2%) and positional headaches (59% vs. 28%).

Conclusions

Among participants with idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus who had a response to temporary CSF drainage, shunting resulted in significant improvements at 3 months in gait velocity and a measure of gait and balance but not in measures of cognition or incontinence.

Gait Velocity Change With Duration of Active Shunting

After the 4-month primary endpoint assessments, the shunts in both the placebo and the open shunt groups were at active shunt settings for the remainder of the study. Gait velocity and other outcome measures were followed for an additional 8 months after the primary end point, resulting in 12 months of active shunting in the open shunt group and 8 months of active shunting in the placebo group (Supplemental Digital Content 2). As expected, gait velocity in the placebo group improved after the shunt was changed to an active setting (Figure 4 A). When matched for duration of active shunting (Figure 4 B), both the open shunt and the placebo groups had the same change in gait velocity after 8 months. Of note, improvement in gait velocity (compared with immediately before active shunting) was statistically significant (P < .05) within each treatment arm at 4 and 8 months, as well as for the entire randomized cohort.

FIGURE 4.
Group gait velocity measures over time. A, Gait velocity changes in 12 months of follow-up from baseline through 12-month postshunt implantation by treatment group. For improvement analysis, the placebo group's baseline of active shunting was 4-month postsurgery compared with the open shunt group's baseline before surgery. A similar significant improvement is shown between both groups in months of active shunting. Cross symbols refer to comparison with baseline († P < .05, †† P < .01). B, Gait velocity changes from baseline to 12 months of active shunting, group comparison. Gait velocity improved without a significant group difference (not significant NS). Blue = placebo group; red = open shunt group. Symbol represents the mean; the box shows the middle 50% of observations in each group, with the line being the median observation. The whiskers go out to the observations no more than 1.5 times the width of the box. Any observations outside this range are shown individually as symbols (○ and +).

The effect of the 4-month delay until active shunting associated with the placebo condition was quantified using linear mixed models, as shown in Supplemental Digital Content 3. Specifically, for change in gait velocity, no effect of the 4-month delay was observed (P = .45).

### Practice guideline: idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: response to shunting and predictors of response: report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^1135ESTi]. Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus — clinical response to shunting: Using the Clinician Interview-Based Impression of Change, plus carer interview (CIBIC-Plus), shunted patients had better global ratings than controls, with median CIBIC-Plus rating 2 vs 6 and significant differences in global outcomes and gait; specifically, 14 of 18 shunted patients improved while 9 of 14 controls worsened, and 89% of shunted patients improved on gait. In a randomized study using the modified Rankin Scale, improvement ≥ 1 point at 3 months occurred in 32 of 49 immediate-shunt vs 2 of 44 delayed patients, yielding a difference 61% [95% CI 42%–68%], p < 0.0001. Overall, shunting is described as possibly effective with a 96% chance of subjective improvement and an 83% chance of improvement on the timed walk test at 6 months, with serious adverse events 11% and subjective improvement reported by 95% vs 19% of controls; among objective measures, only gait improved significantly.

### Shunting for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^111vyaKm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) occurs when the brain ventricles expand, causing a triad of gait, cognitive, and urinary impairment. It can occur after a clear brain injury such as trauma, but can also occur without a clear cause (termed idiopathic, or iNPH). Non-randomised studies have shown a benefit from surgically diverting ventricular fluid to an area of lower pressure by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-shunting in iNPH, but historically there have been limited randomised controlled trial (RCT) data to confirm this.

Objectives

To determine the effect of CSF-shunting versus no CSF-shunting in people with iNPH and the frequency of adverse effects of CSF-shunting in iNPH.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate), LILACS (BIREME), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 15 February 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included only RCTs of people who had symptoms of gait, cognitive, or urinary impairment with communicating hydrocephalus (Evans index of > 0.3) and normal CSF pressure. Control groups included those with no CSF shunts or those with CSF shunts that were in 'inactive' mode.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Where necessary, we contacted study authors requesting data not provided in the papers. We assessed the overall certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included four RCTs, of which three were combined in a meta-analysis. The four RCTs included 140 participants (73 with immediate CSF-shunting and 67 controls who had delayed CSF-shunting) with an average age of 75 years. Risk of bias was low in all parallel-group outcomes evaluated apart from gait speed, cognitive function (general cognition and Symbol Digit Test) (some concerns) and adverse events, which were not blind-assessed. CSF-shunting probably improves gait speed at less than six months post-surgery (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 0.99; 3 studies, 116 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). CSF-shunting may improve qualitative gait function at less than six months post-surgery by an uncertain amount (1 study, 88 participants; low-certainty evidence). CSF-shunting probably results in a large reduction of disability at less than six months post-surgery (risk ratio 2.08, 95% CI 1.31 to 3.31; 3 studies, 118 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of CSF-shunting on cognitive function at less than six months post-CSF-shunt surgery (SMD 0.35, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.74; 2 studies, 104 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence is also very uncertain about the effect of CSF-shunt surgery on adverse events (1 study, 88 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There were no data regarding the effect of CSF-shunting on quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

We found moderate-certainty evidence that CSF-shunting likely improves gait speed and disability in iNPH in the relative short term. The evidence is very uncertain regarding cognition and adverse events. There were no longer-term RCT data for any of our prespecified outcomes. More studies are required to improve the certainty of these findings. In addition, more information is required regarding patient ethnicity and the effect of CSF-shunting on quality of life.

### Postshunt cognitive and functional improvement in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^111tMjRv]. Neurosurgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Improvement in gait after shunt placement has been well documented in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH); however, controversy remains regarding the extent and pattern of postsurgical cognitive changes. Conflicting findings may be explained by variability in both test selection and follow-up intervals across studies. Furthermore, most investigations lack a control group, making it difficult to disentangle practice effects from a true treatment effect.

Objective

To examine postshunt changes in a sample of well-characterized iNPH participants compared with a group of age- and education-matched healthy control subjects.

Methods

We identified 12 participants with iNPH undergoing shunt placement and 9 control participants. All participants were evaluated with comprehensive neuropsychological testing and standardized gait assessment at baseline and were followed up for 6 months.

Results

Repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed a significant group- (iNPH and control) by-time (baseline and 6 months) interaction for Trailmaking Test B: (P < .003) and Symbol Digit Modalities (P < .02), with greater improvement in iNPH participants relative to control subjects. In addition, the iNPH group showed greater improvement in gait (P < .001) and caregivers reported improved activities of daily living (P < .01) and reduced caregiver distress (P < .01).

Conclusion

This study demonstrates improvements in mental tracking speed and sustained attention 6 months after shunt placement in iNPH. The present investigation is the first study to use a controlled design to show that cognitive improvement in iNPH is independent of practice effects. Furthermore, these findings indicate functional and quality-of-life improvements for both the shunt responder and their caregiver.

### Normal pressure hydrocephalus: long-term outcome after shunt surgery [^111KMbSd]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Background/Objective

Little is known about the long-term clinical course and management of patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) treated by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed records of 55 patients diagnosed with idiopathic NPH (INPH) and treated with CSF shunts, all of whom were followed for more than 3 years after the original shunt surgery. At each annual follow-up visit, the patient was assessed by Folstein Mini Mental State Examination, detailed clinical evaluation of gait and assessment of headache, cognition, gait or urination, as assessed by the patient and relatives.

Results

The mean duration of follow-up was 5.9 ± 2.5 years. There was an overall sustained improvement among all symptoms. Gait showed the highest maintenance of improvement over baseline (83% at 3 years and 87% at the last analysed follow-up of 7 years), cognition showed intermediary improvement (84% and 86%, respectively), and urinary incontinence showed the least improvement (84% and 80%, respectively). Fifty-three percent of patients required shunt revisions. Indications for revision included shunt malfunction (87%), infection (10%) and change of shunt configuration (3%). Overall, 74% revisions resulted in clinical improvement.

Conclusions

Clinical improvement of patients with NPH can be sustained for 5–7 years in some patients with NPH, even if shunt revision surgery is needed multiple times. With earlier diagnosis and treatment of NPH and the increasing lifespan of the ageing population, the need for long-term follow-up after shunt surgery for NPH may be greater than it was in the past. Monitoring, identification and treatment of shunt obstruction is a key management principle.

### Long-term outcome in patients with suspected normal pressure hydrocephalus [^112qy9UM]. Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the outcome of patients with suspected normal pressure hydrocephalus at 6 months and 5 years after shunt surgery.

Methods

Seventy-five patients (mean age, 72.5 6 9 yr), with normal pressure hydrocephalus symptoms were included. Fifty-four patients with positive lumbar infusion and/or cerebrospinal fluid tap tests received a cerebrospinal fluid shunt, whereas 21 patients with negative test results did not undergo operation. Walk, reaction time, memory, and identical forms tests were used as baseline (before surgery) tests and were repeated at short- (6.1 6 4.6 mo) and long-term (5.5 6 1.4 yr) follow-up evaluations. Activities of daily life functions were assessed using the Barthel index.

Results

At the 6-month follow-up examination, 83% of the operated patients improved in gait, 65% improved in reaction time, 46% improved in memory, and 31% improved in identical forms tests; 96% found themselves subjectively improved. Because of unrelated mortality (37%) and declining general health from comorbidity, only 27 patients were available for the 5-year follow-up evaluation. Twenty-three of these patients had been treated with a shunt and had a remaining improvement in close to 40% in gait and reaction time, whereas fewer than 10% had an improvement in cognitive tests. Fifty-six percent reported subjective improvement compared with preoperative findings. More patients (64%) improved if younger than 75 years; for patients older than 75 years, only 11% of the patients improved. The Barthel index was higher (P < 0.05) in improved patients.

Conclusion

Patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus benefit from shunt surgery for at least 5 years. High mortality rate, comorbidity, and old age hamper good long-term outcome and emphasize the importance of patient selection.

### Cerebrospinal fluid transcripts may predict shunt surgery responses in normal pressure hydrocephalus [^111Mo6ud]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

Molecular biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases are critical for advancing diagnosis and therapy. Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a neurological disorder characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, gait impairment, urinary incontinence and cognitive decline. In contrast to most other neurodegenerative disorders, NPH symptoms can be improved by the placement of a ventricular shunt that drains excess CSF. A major challenge in NPH management is the identification of patients who benefit from shunt surgery. Here, we perform genome-wide RNA sequencing of extracellular vesicles in CSF of 42 NPH patients, and we identify genes and pathways whose expression levels correlate with gait, urinary or cognitive symptom improvement after shunt surgery. We describe a machine learning algorithm trained on these gene expression profiles to predict shunt surgery response with high accuracy. The transcriptomic signatures we identified may have important implications for improving NPH diagnosis and treatment and for understanding disease aetiology.

### Placebo-controlled effectiveness of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus shunting: a randomized pilot trial [^111rybSG]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND:

Multiple prospective nonrandomized studies have shown 60% to 70% of patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) improve with shunt surgery, but multicenter placebo-controlled trial data are necessary to determine its effectiveness.

OBJECTIVE:

To evaluate the effectiveness of cerebrospinal fluid shunting in iNPH through comparison of open vs placebo shunting groups at 4 months using a pilot study.

METHODS:

Patients were randomized to a Codman Certas Plus valve (Integra LifeSciences) set at 4 (open shunt group) or 8 ("virtual off"; placebo group). Patients and assessors were blinded to treatment group. The primary outcome measure was 10-m gait velocity. Secondary outcome measures included functional scales for bladder control, activities of daily living, depression, and quality of life. Immediately after 4-month evaluation, all shunts were adjusted in a blinded fashion to an active setting and followed to 12 months after shunting.

RESULTS:

A total of 18 patients were randomized. At the 4-month evaluation, gait velocity increased by 0.28 ± 0.28 m/s in the open shunt group vs 0.04 ± 0.17 m/s in the placebo group. The estimated treatment difference was 0.22 m/s ([P = .071], 95% CI −0.02 to 0.46). Overactive Bladder Short Form symptom bother questionnaire significantly improved in open shunt vs placebo (P = .007). The 4-month treatment delay did not reduce the subsequent response to active shunting, nor did it increase the adverse advents rate at 12 months.

CONCLUSION:

This multicenter, randomized pilot study demonstrates the effectiveness, safety, and feasibility of a placebo-controlled trial in iNPH, and found a trend suggesting gait velocity improves more in the open shunt group than in the placebo group.

### Good outcome in patients with normal-pressure hydrocephalus and factors indicating poor prognosis [^113K6kuZ]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

Object

The authors set out to describe the outcome in a subgroup of patients with normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) in whom prognostic factors were poor. This subgroup of patients who had received shunts was selected according to strict criteria.

Methods

From a cohort of 56 patients with NPH in whom shunts were placed, the authors selected a subgroup with four of the factors traditionally considered to indicate poor prognosis: idiopathic type, cortical atrophy, longstanding symptoms, and presence of dementia in addition to old age. Twelve patients met the inclusion criteria. After receiving shunts, 92% of the patients showed clinical improvement on the NPH scale; gait improved in 100% of patients, sphincter control in 90%, and dementia in 33%. Improvement was significant for gait and sphincter control, general NPH score, and most daily life activity scales. No significant differences regarding clinical, cognitive, or functional changes following surgery were found in comparison with the rest of patients (the good prognosis subgroup).

Conclusions

The clinical condition of patients with NPH who present with traditionally accepted markers of poor prognosis can improve after surgery, especially as regards gait and sphincter control. The authors assert that the presence of these markers should not be considered to be an absolute criterion for ruling out shunt surgery in cases of NPH syndrome.

### Is the placement of shunts in patients with idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus worth the risk? Results of a study based on continuous monitoring of intracranial pressure [^117VMLfN]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2004). Low credibility.

Object

Data from many studies have demonstrated that shunt insertion in patients with idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is associated with high morbidity and a lack of significant improvement; however, the use of strict diagnostic and treatment protocols can improve the results of surgery in these patients. The primary aim in this prospective study was to analyze the results of shunt placement in 43 patients with idiopathic NPH. A secondary aim was to determine the relationship between several clinical and neuroimaging factors, and patient outcome after surgery.

Methods

Thirty men and 13 women with a mean age of 71.1 ± 6.9 years participated in this study. All patients underwent clinical, neuropsychological, and radiological assessment before and 6 months after surgery. In all patients continuous monitoring of intracranial pressure was performed using a fiberoptic extradural sensor. In 31 patients cerebrospinal fluid dynamics were also determined. Eighty-six percent of patients showed clinical improvement after shunt insertion, 11.6% showed no change, and 2.3% exhibited some worsening. Gait improved in 81.4% of the patients, sphincter control in 69.8%, and cognitive dysfunction in 39.5%. There was no treatment-related death. Early or late postsurgical complications occurred in six patients (14%), although all of these complications were minor or were satisfactorily resolved. The complete clinical triad, cortical sulci size, and periventricular lucencies were related to outcome, whereas patient age, symptom duration, ventricular dilation, and the degree of presurgical dementia were unrelated to outcome.

Conclusions

Given the correct diagnosis, shunt insertion can produce marked improvement in patients with idiopathic NPH syndrome, causing few deaths and few clinically relevant complications.

### The effect of shunt surgery on neuropsychological performance in normal pressure hydrocephalus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114sUF4g]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is characterized by a build-up of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain despite apparently normal CSF pressure at lumbar puncture. Idiopathic NPH (iNPH) typically occurs in later life and without any obvious cause. Symptoms include gait disturbance, urinary incontinence and progressive dementia. Dementia-related symptoms are characterised by deficits in memory, visuospatial abilities, psychomotor speed and executive function.

The effect of shunt treatment on cognitive performance in patients with NPH is controversial. While CSF drainage is generally considered to relieve problems with gait and incontinence, cognitive impairment is reported to be the least likely symptom to improve. Rates of cognitive improvement range from 0 to 80% of patients in a given series. However, methodological limitations have been identified which could explain the variability observed between studies. These include unclear patient selection criteria, inconsistent follow up intervals and use of subjective measures of improvement. Additionally, due to the lack of standardized clinical guidelines for assessing cognitive function in this patient group, assessment methods often vary between centres with functional grading scales, clinical rating scales, and neuropsychological testing being employed. Studies that have focused on neuropsychological test performance generally show a beneficial effect of shunt surgery on cognitive function. However, again, the pattern of post-operative neuropsychological improvement varies widely between studies [e.g.,].

Understanding the neuropsychology of NPH may be useful for differential diagnosis as well as interpretation of outcome following treatment. We combined data from the most frequently used neuropsychological tests in an attempt to determine the effect of shunt surgery on neuropsychological performance in patients with NPH. We included studies using neuropsychological tests to assess cognition before and after shunt surgery. We conducted meta-analyses on pre- and post-operative scores for each test. Additionally, we conducted exploratory analyses to investigate effects of moderator variables on cognitive outcome.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) — shunt efficacy and harms: Shunting is possibly effective in iNPH, and serious adverse event risk was 11%.

### Practice guideline: idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: response to shunting and predictors of response: report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^1139fGLs]. Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus — tap test (TT) and external lumbar drainage (ELD) as predictors: In one Class III study, 19 patients with iNPH underwent prolonged ELD followed by shunting and improvement with ELD predicted shunt response; when gait was measured, 16 of 19 who improved with ELD improved with shunting and 1 of 3 who did not improve with ELD still improved with shunting. A Class I study of 142 patients found no correlation between TT results and outcome, reporting negative predictive value only 18% and overall accuracy 53%. The conclusion states there is insufficient high-quality evidence to conclude that improvement with ELD predicts shunt response; patients who improve after TT may be more likely to respond to shunting, but negative TTs do not preclude a response.

### Genetic risk factors in normal pressure hydrocephalus: what we know and what is next [^1114Df1Z]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), first described in 1965, is characterized by gait instability, cognitive decline, and impaired bladder control, collectively known as the Hakim triad. It is currently divided into primary NPH, with no identifiable cause, and secondary NPH, linked to previous intracranial insults.

The diagnosis of primary NPH is guided by two major criteria sets. The Japanese guideline categorizes NPH as possible, probable, and definite, whereas the International guideline classifies it as unlikely, possible, and probable". Unlikely NPH" refers to cases where symptoms are better explained by other causes. For "possible NPH", the Japanese guideline requires at least two symptoms from the triad, excluding atypical or secondary features, whereas the International guideline requires at least one symptom, which may be accompanied by atypical features. For "probable NPH", both guidelines require at least two symptoms (particularly gait disturbance), normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure, and specific neuroimaging features (or symptom improvement after a CSF drainage test in the Japanese guideline). "Definite NPH" refers to individuals who improve after shunt surgery.

The prevalence of NPH increases with age, ranging from 0.003% in individuals aged 50–59 yearsto 5.9% in those aged 80 years and older. Martín‐Láez et alsuggested that 60 years could be considered the threshold for a population "at risk for NPH", given its prevalence is 15‐fold higher in the seventh decade of life compared with the sixth. Although familial NPH has been underexplored, 4.8% of patients with NPH reported a relative who underwent shunt placementand approximately 7% of first‐degree relatives exhibit two or more NPH triad symptoms. Similarly, the genetic factors contributing to NPH risk or protection remain poorly understood and have not been systematically investigated.

In this context, the aim of this systematic review is to assess the contribution of genetics to NPH risk by analyzing the existing literature on familial cases, genetic variants linked to primary NPH, and co‐occurring neurogenetic disorders.

### Diagnosis, treatment, and analysis of long-term outcomes in idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus [^115in3xh]. Neurosurgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The response to shunt surgery for idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (INPH) is variable because INPH is difficult to distinguish from other conditions causing the same symptoms. To date, no clinical picture or diagnostic test can distinguish INPH or predict response to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt surgery. We reviewed our 10-year experience with INPH to characterize long-term outcome and to identify independent predictors of outcome after shunt surgery.

Methods

Patients were classified as having INPH only if they had: 1) ventriculomegaly, 2) two or more INPH clinical features, 3) no risk factor for secondary normal-pressure hydrocephalus, 4) A- or B-waves on CSF pressure monitoring, and 5) clinical improvement during a 3-day CSF drainage trial via a spinal catheter. Independent predictors of outcome were assessed via a multivariate proportional hazards regression analysis.

Results

One hundred thirty-two patients underwent 179 shunt surgeries. Forty-four (33%), 79 (60%), and 99 (75%) patients demonstrated objective improvement 3, 6, and 24 months after shunt surgery, respectively. Gait improved first in 88 (93%) patients. Dementia and urinary incontinence were twofold less likely to improve. Radiological evidence of corpus callosum distension, gait impairment as the primary symptom, and shorter duration of INPH symptoms predicted improvement. Duration of symptoms and gait as the primary symptom were independent predictors by multivariate analysis.

Conclusion

INPH can be diagnosed accurately with CSF pressure monitoring and CSF drainage via a spinal catheter. CSF shunting is safe and effective for INPH with a long-term shunt response rate of 75%. Independent predictors of improvement are the presence of gait impairment as the dominant symptom and shorter duration of symptoms.

### Shunt surgery in patients with hydrocephalus and white matter changes [^112V3rs2]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2011). Low credibility.

Object

Patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) often present with impaired gait and cognition together with ventricular enlargement and normal intracranial pressure. Many have vascular risk factors as well as periventricular and deep white matter changes on MR imaging. Abnormal CSF dynamics, that is, high resistance to outflow or improvement after CSF drainage, indicate good effects of shunt surgery. The authors examined whether the worst-case iNPH patients with extensive vascular white matter disease and normal CSF dynamics would benefit from shunt surgery. These patients also fulfilled the criteria for Binswanger disease. Therefore, a randomized controlled double-blind study was performed.

Methods

Fourteen consecutive patients fulfilling the above criteria were randomized to receive either open or closed shunts. At 3 months after surgery, the patients with initially ligated shunts had their shunts opened. Clinical evaluation consisting of 7 quantitative psychometric and 6 continuous gait tests was performed preoperatively and 3 and 6 months after surgery.

Results

Patients randomized to receive open shunts had improved motor (30% increase) and psychometric (23% increase) scores 3 months after shunt placement. There were no significant changes between the 3- and 6-month follow-up in these same patients. Conversely, those with initially ligated shunts were unchanged during the first 3-month period, although they improved in both motor (28%) and cognitive (18%) functions following removal of the ligature.

Conclusions

Patients with enlarged ventricles, hydrocephalic symptoms, and extensive vascular white matter changes benefit from shunt surgery.

### Symptoms and signs did not predict outcome after surgery: a prospective study of 143 patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^116AQ9jo]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The clinical picture of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) comprises disturbed gait and balance, cognitive impairment and urinary incontinence, treatable by CSF shunting. In modern studies, around 80% of treated patients experience improved symptoms. In spite of extensive research into a wide range of radiological, biochemical and hydrodynamic markers, to date no specific test can adequately diagnose iNPH or predict which patients will benefit from shunt surgery. Reliable tests for the prediction of outcomes are warranted.

Concerning symptoms and signs, several studies have suggested that either the presence of the complete triad or a clinical picture with a predominant gait disturbance, are prognostically favorable. Agerskov et al. showed that the sign of shuffling gait was predictive of improvement post-shunting. Earlier studies have been small or limited with regard to studied symptomatology. The POiNT (Prediction of Outcome in iNPH) study was designed to evaluate the predictive value of clinical, CSF and MRI markers on outcome after shunt surgery, and this paper aims to explore the predictive value of a broad panel of symptoms and signs typical for iNPH using an outcome measure specifically developed for iNPH patients.

### Placebo-controlled effectiveness of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus shunting: a randomized pilot trial [^114Ypvz3]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

This pilot study of a placebo-controlled trial of iNPH shunt effectiveness shows an encouraging trend demonstrating that gait velocity improves with active shunting but not with a placebo condition shunt. The lack of significant harm to subjects in the placebo group from the four-month delay until initiation of active shunting suggests that the design is safe and acceptable from the perspective of research ethics. Future studies will require more complete neuropsychological evaluation and evaluation of other aspects of gait and balance, as well as inclusion of CSF and neuroimaging biomarkers. Based on this pilot and the lessons learned, a larger randomized placebo-controlled trial is feasible and is underway. It will have the potential to significantly change surgical practice in the elderly with iNPH.

### Practice guideline: idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: response to shunting and predictors of response: report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^117VYjsm]. Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus — predictors of shunt response: There is evidence that improvement in gait following external lumbar drainage (ELD), MRI-measured high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) velocity through the aqueduct, and abnormal intracranial CSF hydrodynamics may predict a good response to shunting, but publications of a lower evidence class indicate that these measures are not predictive. These procedures are associated with significant cost and potential complications, and, in the case of CSF-ITs, the equipment required is not widely available (particularly in the United States). Identification of Alzheimer pathology at the time of shunting would predict a poor outcome.

### The effectiveness of various CSF diversion surgeries in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115G8QFz]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is commonly treated using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion procedures, most commonly ventriculoperitoneal (VP) but also lumboperitoneal (LP), ventriculoatrial (VA) shunting, and endoscopic third-ventriculostomy (ETV). Despite the prevalence of these interventions and recent advancements in iNPH diagnostic processes, there is limited up-to-date evidence regarding surgical outcomes.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to analyse the effects of CSF diversion surgeries among iNPH patients. The primary outcome was efficacy of the CSF diversion procedure, defined as symptomatic improvement, and secondary outcomes included surgical complications. Several major databases were searched for original studies from inception up to June 4, 2024, which were evaluated using random-effects meta-analyses, meta-regression, and influence analyses. This study was registered with PROSPERO: CRD42023458526.

Findings

Out of the 1963 studies screened, 54 were included in this review, and 4811 patients were pooled. Overall, more than 74% of patients experienced improvement after surgical treatment (95% CI: 70–78%). VP shunting demonstrated an efficacy of 75% (95% CI 70–79%), VA shunting at 75% (95% CI: 70–80%), and LP shunting at 70% (95% CI: 52–83%). ETV had a success rate of 69% (95% CI: 58–78%). Gait improvement was high at 72% (95% CI: 67–77%), while urinary and cognitive dysfunction each improved in approximately 50% of patients. The efficacy of surgery did not increase between 2005 and 2024 (p = 0.54). Complications occurred in 20.6% of cases, with a surgery revision rate of 15.1%.

Interpretation

This meta-analysis found that the overall efficacy of CSF diversion procedures for iNPH remained unchanged from 2005 to 2024, with 74% of cases showing improvement. No procedure was found to be clearly superior, and only half of the patients saw improvements in urinary and cognitive dysfunction. The stagnant efficacy over time and frequent complications highlight the need for improved patient selection criteria to best identify those most likely to benefit from CSF shunting.

Funding

None for this study.

### Practice guideline: idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: response to shunting and predictors of response: report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^117QP5vx]. Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) — ventricular shunting outcomes from a prospective Class III study: A nonrandomized cohort evaluated 75 patients with NPH (58 with iNPH), where 54 with a positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infusion test or CSF tap test underwent shunting and 21 test‑negative patients served as a comparison group. At 6 months, 52 of 54 (96%) shunted patients reported improvement vs 3 of 21 (14%) non‑shunted (risk difference 0.77, 95% CI 0.59–0.89). Objective gait improvement occurred in 83% vs 24% (risk difference 0.59, 95% CI 0.36–0.83), with reaction time 65% vs 46% and memory 48% vs 28%; both gait and subjective improvement were significant (p = 0.0006 for both). At 5 years, 43% of shunted and 19% of nonoperated patients were available; among shunted patients, measured response decreased to 40% improved in gait and reaction time and 10% in memory, while 56% reported ongoing subjective improvement. Reported complications were 3 subdural hematomas or effusions (5%; one required surgical evacuation), one chest infection, one superficial wound infection, and one pulmonary embolism.

### Safety and effectiveness of the assessment and treatment of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus in the adult hydrocephalus clinical research network [^111i1bmJ]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to describe the processes and outcomes associated with patients at five sites in the Adult Hydrocephalus Clinical Research Network (AHCRN) who had undergone evaluation and treatment for suspected idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) and had 1-year postoperative follow-up.

Methods

Subjects with possible iNPH who had been prospectively enrolled in the AHCRN registry between November 19, 2014, and December 31, 2018, were evaluated by CSF drainage via either lumbar puncture or external lumbar drainage, consistent with recommendations of the international iNPH guidelines. Standardized clinical evaluations of gait, cognition, urinary symptoms, depression, and functional outcomes were conducted at baseline, before and after CSF drainage, and at 4-month intervals after shunt surgery. Complications of CSF drainage and shunt surgery were recorded.

Results

Seventy-four percent (424/570) of patients with possible iNPH had CSF drainage, and 46% of them (193/424) underwent shunt surgery. The mean change in gait velocity with CSF drainage was 0.18 m/sec in patients who underwent shunt surgery versus 0.08 m/sec in patients who did not. For shunt surgery patients, gait velocity increased by 54% from 0.67 m/sec before CSF drainage to 0.96 m/sec 8–12 months after surgery, and 80% of patients had an increase of at least 0.1 m/sec by the first postoperative visit. Evaluation of cognition, urinary symptoms, depression, and functional outcomes also revealed improvement after shunt surgery. Of 193 patients who had undergone shunt surgery, 176 (91%) had no complications and 17 (9%) had 28 complications. Eleven patients (6%) had 14 serious complications that resulted in the need for surgery or an extended hospital stay. The 30-day reoperation rate was 3%.

Conclusions

Using criteria recommended by the international iNPH guidelines, the authors found that evaluation and treatment of iNPH are safe and effective. Testing with CSF drainage and treatment with shunt surgery are associated with a high rate of sustained improvement and a low rate of complications for iNPH in the 1st year after shunt surgery. Patients who had undergone shunt surgery for iNPH experienced improvement in gait, cognitive function, bladder symptoms, depression, and functional outcome measures. Gait velocity, which is an easily measured, objective, continuous variable, should be used as a standard outcome measure to test a patient's response to CSF drainage and shunt surgery in iNPH.

### Normal pressure hydrocephalus: how often does the diagnosis hold water? [^1115rjmC]. Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine our community's incidence of clinically suspected normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), the rate of shunting for NPH, and short- and long-term outcomes of shunting.

Methods

A retrospective query of the Mayo Clinic medical records linkage system was conducted to identify residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, undergoing an invasive diagnostic procedure for evaluation of suspected NPH from 1995 through 2003. Among patients with shunts, early- and long-term outcomes were determined via a review of available medical records.

Results

Forty-one patients underwent an invasive diagnostic procedure for evaluation of suspected NPH; 13 ultimately received shunts, representing an incidence of 1.19/100,000/year. The incidence of sustained definite improvements at 3 years after shunting was only 0.36/100,000/year. Definite gait improvement was documented in 75% at 3–6 months after shunt placement, although it dropped to 50% at 1 year and to 33% at 3 years. Only 1 of 8 patients with cognitive impairment and 1 of 6 patients with urinary incontinence had definite improvement in these symptoms at 3 years. No patient with moderate to severe postural instability experienced sustained definite improvement in any symptom. Complications occurred in 33% of patients including one perioperative death. Additional or alternative neurologic diagnoses later surfaced in 5 of 12 patients.

Conclusions

In this community, NPH is relatively rare with an incidence approximating that of progressive supranuclear palsy in this population. Whereas early gait improvement was common, only one-third of patients enjoyed continued improvement by 3 years; cognition or urinary incontinence was even less responsive long term. Baseline postural instability predicted poor outcome. Clinicians should balance potential benefits of shunting against the known risks.

### The effectiveness of various CSF diversion surgeries in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115TC9QT]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Among the triad of iNPH symptoms, gait ataxia was shown to have high improvement following CSF diversion in this study. Gait abnormalities, such as reduced gait velocity, stride length, and floor clearance are known to improve significantly after shunting, with previous reports observing early and sustained improvement among 64–77% of cases. In contrast, cognitive improvements are more variable, with around a 50% improvement rate observed in this meta-analysis, similar to the Study of Idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus on Neurological Improvement 2 (SINPHONI-2) trial findings. This disparity likely stems from the different pathophysiology of these symptoms. Gait symptoms are mainly linked to the frontal subcortical circuits and periventricular white matter, which are affected by ventricular enlargement and therefore are likely to improve with the mechanical CSF decompression achieved by shunting. Cognitive symptoms, however, involve more extensive brain networks, including the hippocampus, and can overlap with dementia subtypes that are not responsive to shunting. Urinary symptoms improved in about half of the patients after surgery, likely due to the normalisation of pressure in periventricular white matter tracts involved in bladder control. However, improvement in urinary symptoms may be less pronounced due to the complex and widespread network involved in bladder control and potential concomitant neurodegenerative changes that are not as reversible.

### Placebo-controlled effectiveness of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus shunting: a randomized pilot trial [^116NanFZ]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a syndrome that presents in the elderly with progressive impairment of gait and balance, cognition, and urinary control. The estimated prevalence of iNPH ranges from 300 000 to 700 000 patients in the United States, - and a 2007 study using the Medicare database found that only 25% of patients older than 65 years with the diagnosis of iNPH received shunt surgery. Although iNPH is considered potentially reversible with ventriculoperitoneal shunting (VPS), and multiple studies have suggested that 70% to 80% of patients improve with shunt surgery, - concern exists about variable results, durability of benefit, and surgical risks of shunt surgery in the elderly, in part due to a lack of evidence from a placebo-controlled trial.

Unfortunately, surgical placebo-controlled trials are inherently difficult to perform, often with practical and ethical. In addition, 2 previous small-N single-center placebo-controlled trials did not yield convincing proof of effectiveness. To demonstrate the feasibility of a large multicenter trial, we designed and performed a pilot blinded, placebo-controlled, delayed treatment study in the Adult Hydrocephalus Clinical Research Network.

### CSF tap test in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: still a necessary prognostic test? [^115NRgYQ]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) — the leading cause of reversible dementia in aging — is characterized by gait, cognitive and urinary impairments with ventriculomegaly at brain imaging. Difficulty of diagnosing iNPH with routine neurological and neuroradiological assessments explains why only 8% of patients receive disease-specific treatment. INPH symptoms are unspecific and frequently found in other neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) or vascular dementia, which frequently occur as comorbidities. Moreover, the treatment for iNPH relies on invasive shunt placement, thus requiring careful cost/benefit evaluation, especially in older populations. These considerations highlight the importance of improving the diagnostic procedure to identify appropriate candidates for invasive shunt surgery from those with neurological disorders mimicking iNPH, or from iNPH patients with comorbidities that can interfere with reversibility. In this regard, a better understanding of the factors that underlie or hamper symptom reversibility is of primary importance.

Among the predictors of shunt surgery outcome, the cerebrospinal fluid tap test (CSFTT) has high positive predictive value and is routinely used as prognostic test. Nonetheless, the CSFTT is an invasive procedure with contraindications and patient discomfort. Moreover, the factors underlying symptom reversibility after CSFTT are not clear yet. Few studies have investigated clinical and neuroradiological correlates of CSFTT response, including cognitive scores, apathy, gait phenotype and brain morphology, with non-conclusive results and without taking into account more advanced neuroimaging markers, such as white matter (WM) microstructure or brain functional connectivity. Although the pathophysiology of iNPH is not clear yet, different mechanisms have been proposed including periventricular axonal neurodegeneration and small vessel damage. Moreover, alterations of large-scale brain functional organization have been observed, with particular involvement of the default mode network (DMN), and partial functional normalization after CSFTT suggesting a role in determining outcome. Integrating advanced neuroimaging methods probing iNPH pathophysiological mechanisms may identify reversible mechanisms that will eventually improve the diagnostic procedure and contribute to the prediction of CSFTT outcome, shading new light on the factors underlying short-term symptom reversibility.

### Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a systematic review of diagnosis and outcome [^116L5H9G]. Neurosurgery (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Patient selection for cerebrospinal fluid diversion is difficult, because idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (INPH) mimics other neurodegenerative disorders and no findings reliably predict outcome. The literature was reviewed to identify diagnostic criteria that predict shunt response and to formulate prognostic expectations.

Methods

MEDLINE was searched, and 44 articles meeting predetermined criteria were included.

Results

Clinical series were frequently retrospective with small patient numbers and unstandardized outcome evaluation. Clinical findings suggestive of shunt responsiveness were the complete triad (gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and dementia) with early gait disturbance. Degree of hydrocephalus was not correlated with clinical improvement. Reduction of the subcortical low-blood flow area was correlated with improvement in three small studies. Clinical response to prolonged cerebrospinal fluid drainage predicted shunt outcome in all cases in two small series. Overall, 59% (range, 24–100%) of patients improved after shunting, and 29% (range, 10–100%) of patients experienced prolonged improvement. Complications occurred in 38% (range, 5–100%) of patients, additional surgery was required in 22% (range, 0–47%) of patients, and there was a 6% (range, 0–35%) combined rate of permanent neurological deficit and death.

Conclusion

Shunting INPH is associated with an approximately 29% rate of significant improvement and a 6% significant complication rate. Enlargement of the subcortical low-flow area and clinical improvement secondary to prolonged lumbar drainage may provide additive predictive value above clinical and computed tomographic criteria. A multicenter clinical trial that focuses on the value of ancillary tests, defines the clinical course of a patient with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, and evaluates the cost effectiveness of shunting INPH is needed to better describe outcome from shunting in INPH.

### Management of normal pressure hydrocephalus [^113qsdET]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Gait instability, urinary incontinence, and dementia are the signs and symptoms typically found in patients who have normal pressure hydrocephalus. Estimated to cause no more than 5 percent of cases of dementia, normal pressure hydrocephalus often is treatable, and accurate recognition of the clinical triad coupled with radiographic evidence most commonly identifies likely responders. Magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography typically demonstrates ventricular dilation with preservation of the surrounding brain tissue. The abnormality in normal pressure hydrocephalus occurs secondary to an abnormality in fluid removal, leading to an increase in ventricular size and encroachment of enlarged ventricles on adjacent brain tissue. The pressure exerted on the cerebral parenchyma by immense fluid-filled cavities deforms white matter tracts, instigating gait abnormalities and incomplete control of the bladder, as well as difficulties in processing incoming stimulation and in producing expeditious responses. Signs and symptoms often occur as sequelae to an imbalance between the expected ongoing production of cerebrospinal fluid and continuous efflux. Ventriculoperitoneal shunting is used to relieve excess ventricular fluid not absorbed by normal physiologic channels. Multiple studies have explored various techniques to identify patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus in an effort to predict likely benefit from shunting. However, the effectiveness of cerebrospinal fluid diversion has never been proven in a randomized controlled trial comparing use of a shunt versus no shunt.

### Disability risk or unimproved symptoms following shunt surgery in patients with idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus: post hoc analysis of SINPHONI-2 [^116cQuBQ]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2017). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE The study aim was to assess the influence of presurgical clinical symptom severity and disease duration on outcomes of shunt surgery in patients with idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH). The authors also evaluated the cerebrospinal fluid tap test as a predictor of improvements following shunt surgery. METHODS Eighty-three patients (45 men and 38 women, mean age 76.4 years) underwent lumboperitoneal shunt surgery, and outcomes were evaluated until 12 months following surgery. Risks for poor quality of life (Score 3 or 4 on the modified Rankin Scale [mRS]) and severe gait disturbance were evaluated at 3 and 12 months following shunt surgery, and the tap test was also conducted. Age-adjusted and multivariate relative risks were calculated using Cox proportional-hazards regression. RESULTS Of 83 patients with iNPH, 45 (54%) improved by 1 point on the mRS and 6 patients (7%) improved by ≥ 2 points at 3 months following surgery. At 12 months after surgery, 39 patients (47%) improved by 1 point on the mRS and 13 patients (16%) improved by ≥ 2 points. On the gait domain of the iNPH grading scale (iNPHGS), 36 patients (43%) improved by 1 point and 13 patients (16%) improved by ≥ 2 points at 3 months following surgery. Additionally, 32 patients (38%) improved by 1 point and 14 patients (17%) by ≥ 2 points at 12 months following surgery. In contrast, 3 patients (4%) and 2 patients (2%) had worse symptoms according to the mRS or the gait domain of the iNPHGS, respectively, at 3 months following surgery, and 5 patients (6%) and 3 patients (4%) had worse mRS scores and gait domain scores, respectively, at 12 months after surgery. Patients with severe preoperative mRS scores had a 4.7 times higher multivariate relative risk (RR) for severe mRS scores at 12 months following surgery. Moreover, patients with severe gait disturbance prior to shunt surgery had a 46.5 times greater multivariate RR for severe gait disturbance at the 12-month follow-up. Patients without improved gait following the tap test had multivariate RRs for unimproved gait disturbance of 7.54 and 11.2 at 3 and 12 months following surgery, respectively. Disease duration from onset to shunt surgery was not significantly associated with postoperative symptom severity or unimproved symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Patients with iNPH should receive treatment before their symptoms become severe in order to achieve an improved quality of life. However, the progression of symptoms varies between patients so specific timeframes are not meaningful. The authors also found that tap test scores accurately predicted shunt efficacy. Therefore, indications for shunt surgery should be carefully assessed in each patient with iNPH, considering the relative risks and benefits for that person, including healthy life expectancy.

### Placebo-controlled effectiveness of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus shunting: a randomized pilot trial [^113yzxdX]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measure was maximum gait velocity over 3 trials for a 10-m walk. Baseline gait velocity was measured within 6 week before surgery and at 4, 8, and 12 months after surgery. Quality control of this measure was ensured by site training and central gait laboratory review of gait test videos. Secondary outcome measures, including the MoCA, Symbol Digit Modalities Test, the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire, Short Form, Beck Depression Inventory-second edition, Lawton Activities of Daily Living/Independent Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire, and modified Rankin Score scores, were administered at similar intervals. All outcome assessments were performed by trained, blinded evaluators. Adverse events collected included surgical complications, falls, and decreased cognitive function, and were monitored by an independent data and safety monitoring board.

Analysis

All effectiveness outcomes were assessed using an analysis of covariance, where a linear regression model was fit with 4-month gait velocity as the dependent outcome variable and assigned treatment arm as a predictor along with baseline gait velocity. Effectiveness evaluations used two-sided testing with type I error of 0.05. Significance assessment for the 2 prespecified secondary outcomes of effectiveness was controlled for multiple comparisons. The effect of delayed shunting (ie, differences between treatment arms in observed improvement after 4 to 8 months of active shunting) was evaluated using linear mixed models for outcome data over time. Complications were analyzed as binary outcomes.

### Diagnosis and management of idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus: a prospective study in 151 patients [^1172V8ni]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

Object

The diagnosis and management of idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) remains controversial, particularly in selecting patients for shunt insertion. The use of clinical criteria coupled with imaging studies has limited effectiveness in predicting shunt success. The goal of this prospective study was to assess the usefulness of clinical criteria together with brain imaging studies, resistance testing, and external lumbar drainage (ELD) of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in determining which patients would most likely benefit from shunt surgery.

Methods

One hundred fifty-one patients considered at risk for idiopathic NPH were prospectively studied according to a fixed management protocol. The clinical criterion for idiopathic NPH included ventriculomegaly demonstrated on computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging studies combined with gait disturbance, incontinence, and dementia. Subsequently, all patients with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic NPH underwent a lumbar tap for the measurement of CSF resistance. Following this procedure, patients were admitted to the hospital neurosurgical service for a 3-day ELD of CSF. Video assessment of gait and neuropsychological testing was conducted before and after drainage. A shunt procedure was then offered to patients who had experienced clinical improvement from ELD. Shunt outcome was assessed at 1 year postsurgery.

Conclusions

Data in this report affirm that gait improvement immediately following ELD is the best prognostic indicator of a positive shunt outcome, with an accuracy of prediction greater than 90%. Furthermore, bolus resistance testing is useful as a prognostic tool, does not require hospitalization, can be performed in an outpatient setting, and has an overall accuracy of 72% in predicting successful ELD outcome. Equally important is the finding that improvement with shunt surgery is independent of age up to the ninth decade of life in patients who improved on ELD.

### Placebo-controlled effectiveness of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus shunting: a randomized pilot trial [^113WYK38]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Change in gait velocity was chosen as the primary outcome measure because it is widely used to select patients for shunt surgery as a response to CSF drainage, and has recently been confirmed to be a robust outcome measure for iNPH. The primary outcome finding was the trend to improved gait velocity by 0.28 m/s in the open shunt group compared with 0.04 m/s in the placebo group at 4 months (P = .07). It is recognized that gait changes in iNPH are not limited to velocity and a more complete evaluation of the effect of shunting on motor deficits will also include evaluation of other factors, especially balance. In addition, bladder control was improved in the open shunt group compared with Placebo. Our results are similar to 2 single-center studies. A University of Gothenburg study (n = 14) showed a 30% improvement in gait performance at 3 months in patients with open shunts vs 0.4% in those with ligated shunts. A Queen Square study (n = 14) reported a 43% improvement in gait velocity at 3 months in patients with a shunt opening pressure of 5 cmH 2 O vs 0% in those with a shunt opening pressure of 20 cmH 2 O. Unlike these studies, the method and measurement in this pilot are designed to facilitate a larger patient recruitment, and uses a noninvasive and a more complete, well-blinded placebo.

Other outcome measures, such as those of cognitive function and general functional scales, did not demonstrate significant change. The cognitive decline commonly found in iNPH is generally recognized to be more variable in degree and response to shunting. Although additional enrollment may allow demonstration of cognitive changes, the cognitive screening tools used in the study may be insufficient. A more complete neuropsychological testing battery will be used in a forthcoming study.

### Survival in treated idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^113iRWBo]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Postoperative outcome

Patients who improved in the gait scale and in the mRS were shown to subsequently survive longer than patients who did not improve in these scales. A similar finding was reported by Mirzayan et al; patients who survived the follow-up after 5 years, showed greater postoperative improvements in cardinal symptoms, than patients who died before the follow-up. An earlier study showed that patients who had to wait for shunt surgery had worse surgical outcome, meaning that the reversibility of symptoms diminish over time. The finding in the present study, that patients with good surgical effects had better survival or even the same as the general population, should further emphasize the need of early diagnosis and operation without delay.

Why some patients deteriorated postoperatively is not known. One hypothesis could be that a higher burden of vascular comorbidity would explain both the worse result and the higher mortality. However, analyzing the groups of patients that were improved, unchanged, or deteriorated in the gait scale and in the mRS — no difference in the prevalence of the reported comorbidities was found. This is in line with earlier studies: also patients with vascular comorbidity improve after shunting for iNPH. In addition, there were no sex differences and no large age differences — the median ages for patients who were improved, unchanged or deteriorated in the mRS were 73, 75 and 74 years (p = 0.008), and in the gait scale, there was no significant difference.

In summary, there are probably other factors not accounted for in these registry data that explain why some patients deteriorate after surgery, such as concomitant neurodegenerative disorders.

### Placebo-controlled effectiveness of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus shunting: a randomized pilot trial [^113Br8uL]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Outcomes at the 4-Month Primary End Point

The change in gait velocity and secondary outcome measures at 4 months after shunt surgery in the placebo and open shunt groups compared with presurgical baseline are shown in Table 2 and Figure 3. Mean gait velocity increased by 0.28 m/s (± 0.28) in the open shunt group compared with 0.04 m/s (± 0.17) in the placebo group. Modeling of treatment effect found a statistical trend (P = .07) of a benefit of active shunting. The change in MoCA score showed no treatment difference. However, the Overactive Bladder Short Form symptom bother questionnaire showed significant improvement in the open shunt group (P = .007; significant at the 0.05 level after accounting for multiple secondary effectiveness outcomes).

### Practice guideline: idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: response to shunting and predictors of response: report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^113zXm2q]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

We evaluated evidence for utility of shunting in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) and for predictors of shunting effectiveness.

Methods

We identified and classified relevant published studies according to 2004 and 2011 American Academy of Neurology methodology.

Results

Of 21 articles, we identified 3 Class I articles.

Conclusions

Shunting is possibly effective in iNPH (96% chance subjective improvement, 83% chance improvement on timed walk test at 6 months) (3 Class III). Serious adverse event risk was 11% (1 Class III). Predictors of success included elevated Ro (1 Class I, multiple Class II), impaired cerebral blood flow reactivity to acetazolamide (by SPECT) (1 Class I), and positive response to either external lumbar drainage (1 Class III) or repeated lumbar punctures. Age may not be a prognostic factor (1 Class II). Data are insufficient to judge efficacy of radionuclide cisternography or aqueductal flow measurement by MRI.

Recommendations

Clinicians may choose to offer shunting for subjective iNPH symptoms and gait (Level C). Because of significant adverse event risk, risks and benefits should be carefully weighed (Level B). Clinicians should inform patients with iNPH with elevated Ro and their families that they have an increased chance of responding to shunting compared with those without such elevation (Level B). Clinicians may counsel patients with iNPH and their families that (1) positive response to external lumbar drainage or to repeated lumbar punctures increases the chance of response to shunting, and (2) increasing age does not decrease the chance of shunting being successful (both Level C).

### Objective assessment of patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus following ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement using activity-monitoring data: pilot study [^115g5RYg]. Neurosurgical Focus (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) results in significant morbidity in the elderly with symptoms of dementia, gait instability, and urinary incontinence. In well-selected patients, ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) placement often results in clinical improvement. Most postshunt assessments of patients rely on subjective scales. The goal of this study was to assess the utility of remote activity monitoring to provide objective evidence of gait improvement following VPS placement for iNPH.

Methods

Patients with iNPH were prospectively enrolled and fitted with 5 activity monitors (on the hip and bilateral thighs and ankles) that they wore for 4 days preoperatively within 30 days of surgery and for 4 days within 30 days postoperatively. Monitors collected continuous data for number of steps, cadence, body position (upright, prone, supine, and lateral decubitus), gait entropy, and the proportion of each day spent active or static. Data were retrieved from the devices and a comparison of pre- and postoperative movement assessment was performed. The gait data were also correlated with formal clinical gait assessments before and after lumbar puncture and with motion analysis laboratory testing at baseline and 1 month and 1 year after VPS placement.

Results

Twenty patients fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria (median age 76 years). The baseline median number of daily steps was 1929, the median percentage of the day spent inactive was 70%, the median percentage of the day with a static posture was 95%, the median gait velocity was 0.49 m/sec, and the median number of steps required to turn was 8. There was objective improvement in median entropy from pre- to postoperatively, increasing from 0.6 to 0.8 (p = 0.002). There were no statistically significant differences for any of the remaining variables measured by the activity monitors when comparing the preoperative to the 1-month postoperative time point. All variables from motion analysis testing showed statistically significant differences or a trend toward significance at 1 year after VPS placement. Among the significantly correlated variables at baseline, cadence was inversely correlated with percentage of gait cycle spent in the support phase (contact with ground vs swing phase).

Conclusions

This pilot study suggests that activity monitoring provides an early objective measure of improvement in gait entropy after VPS placement among patients with iNPH, although a more significant improvement was noted on the detailed clinical gait assessments. Further long-term studies are needed to determine the utility of remote monitoring for assessing gait improvement following VPS placement.

### Symptoms and signs did not predict outcome after surgery: a prospective study of 143 patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^1137ZuQw]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the utility of symptoms, signs, comorbidities and background variables for the prediction of outcome of treatment in iNPH.

Methods

A prospective observational study of consecutively included iNPH patients, who underwent neurological, physiotherapeutic and neuropsychological assessments before and after shunt surgery. The primary outcome measure was the total change on the iNPH scale, and patients were defined as improved postoperatively if they had improved by at least five points on that scale.

Results

143 iNPH patients were included, and 73% of those were improved after surgery. None of the examined symptoms or signs could predict which patients would improve after shunt surgery. A dominant subjective complaint of memory problems at baseline was predictive of non-improvement. The reported comorbidities, duration of symptoms and BMI were the same in improved and non-improved patients. Each of the symptom domains (gait, neuropsychology, balance, and continence) as well as the total iNPH scale score improved significantly (from median 53 to 69, p < 0.001). The proportions of patients with shuffling gait, broad-based gait, paratonic rigidity and retropulsion all decreased significantly.

Discussion

This study confirms that the recorded clinical signs, symptoms, and impairments in the adopted clinical tests are characteristic findings in iNPH, based on that most of them improved after shunt surgery. However, our clinical data did not enable predictions of whether patients would respond to shunt surgery, indicating that the phenotype is unrelated to the reversibility of the iNPH state and should mainly support diagnosis. Absence of specific signs should not be used to exclude patients from treatment.

### Practice guideline: idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: response to shunting and predictors of response: report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^11279X4P]. Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

MRI aqueductal cerebrospinal fluid flow in suspected iNPH — predictive value for shunt response: In a Class II study of 49 suspected NPH patients selected by clinical picture and imaging (with large-volume LP in 36), shunting was followed by improved gait in 86%, improved continence in 69%, and improved cognitive function in 44%, and elevated aqueductal flow rate did not predict response although all patients with rates > 33 mL/min did improve. In a Class III cohort stratified by intracranial pressure, values greater than approximately 10 mm/s were considered elevated and, of 33 with active or compensated hydrocephalus, 29 had elevated velocities with 28 of these improving with shunting, while of the 4 with normal aqueductal velocity, 3 improved. Another Class III study using a cutoff flow rate of 24 mL/min reported MRI sensitivity 46% and specificity 95% for iNPH, and a third study stratifying aqueductal CSF stroke volume as low (≤ 50 μL), medium (51–100 μL), and high (≥ 101 μL) found no relationship between this measure and shunt response. Overall, patients with suspected iNPH who have high-velocity aqueductal flow on MRI and an abnormal CSF-IT are possibly more likely to respond to shunting (1 Class II study and 2 Class III studies).

### MRI-based prediction of clinical improvement after ventricular shunt placement for normal pressure hydrocephalus: development and evaluation of an integrated multisequence machine learning algorithm [^114TmcC2]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) are sometimes refractory to shunt placement, with limited ability to predict improvement for individual patients. We evaluated an MRI-based artificial intelligence method to predict postshunt NPH symptom improvement.

Materials and Methods

Patients with NPH who underwent MRI before shunt placement at a single center (2014–2021) were identified. Twelve-month postshunt improvement in mRS, incontinence, gait, and cognition were retrospectively abstracted from clinical documentation. 3D deep residual neural networks were built on skull-stripped T2-weighted and FLAIR images. Predictions based on both sequences were fused by additional network layers. Patients from 2014–2019 were used for parameter optimization, while those from 2020–2021 were used for testing. Models were validated on an external validation data set from a second institution (n = 33).

Results

Of 249 patients, n = 201 and n = 185 were included in the T2-based and FLAIR-based models according to imaging availability. The combination of T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences offered the best performance in mRS and gait improvement predictions relative to models trained on imaging acquired by using only 1 sequence, with area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) values of 0.7395 [0.5765–0.9024] for mRS and 0.8816 [0.8030–0.9602] for gait. For urinary incontinence and cognition, combined model performances on predicting outcomes were similar to FLAIR-only performance, with AUROC values of 0.7874 [0.6845–0.8903] and 0.7230 [0.5600–0.8859].

Conclusions

Application of a combined algorithm by using both T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences offered the best image-based prediction of postshunt symptom improvement, particularly for gait and overall function in terms of mRS.

### Volumetric measurements in the detection of reduced ventricular volume in patients with normal-pressure hydrocephalus whose clinical condition improved after ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement [^114NkeLC]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2002). Low credibility.

Object

The syndrome of normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) refers to the clinical triad of gait disturbance, dementia, and urinary incontinence in association with idiopathic ventriculomegaly and normal intracranial pressure. Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement often yields significant clinical improvements, sometimes without apparent reduction of ventricular size. The authors hypothesized that careful volumetric measurements would show a decrease in ventricular volume in these patients.

Methods

Twenty consecutive patients with NPH underwent placement of VP shunts equipped with programmable valves. In 11 patients pre- and postoperative neuroimaging was performed, which allowed volumetric analysis. Volumetric measurements of the lateral ventricles were calculated in triplicate by National Institutes of Health image-processing software to assess standard computerized tomography (CT) scans (eight patients) or magnetic resonance (MR) images (three patients) obtained before and after shunt placement. Ventricular volumes were also assessed by an independent neuroradiologist. Postoperative studies were performed at a time of clinical improvement, between 1 and 9 months postsurgery (mean 5 months). Preoperative and postoperative Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale evaluations were performed in four patients. Significant clinical improvement occurred in all patients after shunt placement (mean follow-up period 17.5 months). Although 10 (91%) of 11 patients demonstrated a calculable decrease in volume in the lateral ventricles (mean decrease 39%), formal interpretation of neuroimages indicated a definite decrease in lateral ventricular volume in only three (27%) of 11 patients.

Conclusions

Volumetric measurements obtained to compare preoperative and postoperative CT or MR studies obtained in patients with NPH in whom clinical improvement was seen after shunt placement surgery show a demonstrable decrease in ventricular size. Volumetric measurements may be helpful in clinical assessment postoperatively and in guiding programmable valve pressure settings.

### Timing of surgical treatment for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: association between treatment delay and reduced short-term benefit [^112cshwB]. Neurosurgical Focus (2016). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE A growing body of evidence suggests that longer durations of preoperative symptoms may correlate with worse postoperative outcomes following cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion for treatment of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH). The aim of this study is to determine whether the duration of preoperative symptoms alters postoperative outcomes in patients treated for iNPH. METHODS The authors conducted a retrospective review of 393 cases of iNPH involving patients treated with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting. The duration of symptoms prior to the operative intervention was recorded. The following outcome variables were assessed at baseline, 6 months postoperatively, and at last follow-up: gait performance, urinary continence, and cognition. RESULTS The patients' median age at shunt placement was 74 years. Increased symptom duration was significantly associated with worse gait outcomes (relative risk (RR) 1.055 per year of symptoms, p = 0.037), and an overall absence of improvement in any of the classic triad symptomology (RR 1.053 per year of symptoms, p = 0.033) at 6 months postoperatively. Additionally, there were trends toward significance for symptom duration increasing the risk of having no 6-month postoperative improvement in urinary incontinence (RR 1.049 per year of symptoms, p = 0.069) or cognitive symptoms (RR 1.051 per year of symptoms, p = 0.069). However, no statistically significant differences were noted in these outcomes at last follow-up (median 31 months). Age stratification by decade revealed that prolonging symptom duration was significantly associated with lower Mini-Mental Status Examination scores in patients aged 60–70 years, and lack of cognitive improvement in patients aged 70–80 years. CONCLUSIONS Patients with iNPH with longer duration of preoperative symptoms may not receive the same short-term benefits of surgical intervention as patients with shorter duration of preoperative symptoms. However, with longer follow-up, the patients generally reached the same end point. Therefore, when managing patients with iNPH, it may take longer to see the benefits of CSF shunting when patients present with a longer duration of preoperative symptoms.

### Lumboperitoneal shunt in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a prospective controlled study [^114s83v1]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

In this prospective, controlled, monocentric study, we described the clinical and neuroimaging 12-month follow-up of two parallel cohorts of subjects with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), who did or did not undergo lumboperitoneal shunt (LPS).

Methods

We recruited 78 iNPH patients. At baseline, subjects underwent clinical and neuropsychological assessments, 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and tap test. After baseline, 44 patients (LPS group) opted for LPS implantation, whereas 34 subjects (control group) declined surgery. Both cohorts were then followed up for 12 months through scheduled clinical and neuropsychological evaluations every 6 months. 3 T MRI was repeated at 12-month follow-up.

Results

Gait, balance, and urinary continence improved in the LPS group, without significant influence on cognitive functions. Conversely, gait and urinary continence worsened in the control group. No preoperative MRI parameter was significant outcome predictor after LPS. Of relevance, in responders to LPS, we found postoperative reduction of periventricular white matter (PWM) hyperintensities, which were instead increased in the control group.

Conclusions

LPS is safe and effective in iNPH. An early surgical treatment is desirable to prevent clinical worsening. Post-surgery decrease of PWM hyperintensities may be a useful MRI marker surrogate for clinical effectiveness of LPS.

### Symptoms and signs did not predict outcome after surgery: a prospective study of 143 patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^115rXNyx]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

At the postoperative examination, in the median five (IQR 4–7) months after surgery, 104 (73%) of patients were improved by at least five points on the iNPH scale. There was no difference in the baseline demographic or clinical variables between the 104 improved and the 39 non-improved patients (Table 1).

Regarding the anamnestic information, the reported symptom duration did not differ between the groups (Table 2). Of the 39 non-improved patients, 26% (n = 10) had reported memory impairment as the dominating subjective complaint at the baseline clinical evaluation, compared to 7.8% (n = 8) of the improved patients (p = 0.009). The percentages of patients reporting gait or balance difficulties as dominating subjective complaint did not differ significantly in improved vs non-improved patients, neither when analyzed separately nor merged (total of 69 + 46 = 115 patients, p = 0.154). A report of headache as a presenting symptom was seen in 3 patients, all subsequently non-improved by shunt surgery; apart from that, no other debut symptom was over-represented in improved or non-improved patients (Table 2).

### Value of biomarkers in the prediction of shunt responsivity in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus [^116Wg77X]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

This single-center, prospective observational cohort study was approved by the ethical committee (approval no: 202311 P02) of the University Hospital Hradec Kralove, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic (Chairperson Jiri Vortel, MD) on December 10, 2023. This trial has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06083233).

Participants if this study were recruited between January 2024 and September 2024. Potential participants were identified based on the neurologist's recommendation and after evaluation in our specialized outpatient clinic. All patients provided written informed consent for participation. Inclusion criteria were age > 50 years, diagnosed communicating hydrocephalus on MR or CT, MMSE score > 10 points, and absence of any structural lesion on MRI or CT. Exclusion criteria included known non-communicating hydrocephalus, structural lesion on MRI or CT (tumour, contusion, aneurysm), MMSE ≤ 10 points, life-expectancy shorter than 1 year, pre-existing other type of dementia (m. Alzheimer, vascular dementia). All participants underwent a basic evaluation of responsiveness to VP shunting, which consisted of a stepwise cerebrospinal fluid diagnostic assessment including tap test (TT), lumbar infusion test (LIT), and external lumbar draingage placement (ELD). The patient's gait and balance were monitored using a gait test (shortened to 5 m for our purposes, where the number of steps, 5 m of walking time, and step length were evaluated), along with the MMSE score and the evolution of incontinence. Idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus scale (INPH) was calculated and evaluated before the intial lumbar puncture and 4 h afterward. In the case of TT, gait and MMSE were assessed 24 h post-test, and ELD was evaluated 3 days after placement. In case of a positive response to shunt-responsivity testing (primarily assessed based on gait parameters and MMSE), surgical treatment (ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement) was indicated. This process divided the patients into Group A (anticipated responders to VP shunting), who underwent insertion of VP shunt and Group B (anticipated non-responders) who did not undergo any further treatment. All patients in Group A subsequently underwent ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt surgery and were clinically evaluated at 3 months postoperatively using the iNPH scale. The change in iNPH score served as an objective criterion to confirm postoperative clinical improvement and validate Group A as true responders.

### CSF tap test in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: still a necessary prognostic test? [^115CpXgi]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

The strengths of this study include the availability of multimodal MR brain imaging and quantitative gait assessment in iNPH patients before and after CSFTT. However, the CSFTT has poor specificity for shunting outcome prediction, so that a subset of our nRSP patients may still experience symptom improvement after shunting. Only 8 out of the 30 patients included in this study underwent shunting, with positive outcome at 6-week ambulatorial follow-up. The eight shunted patients were CSFTT responders (seven patients) or experienced moderate post-CSFTT gait improvement (one patient), indicating that in our Center only patients who experience moderate-to-good CSFTT response are referred for surgery. The limited sample size of the shunted groups, the absence of shunted patients with negative outcome at 6 weeks, and the lack of longer post-surgical follow-up precluded an analysis of shunt-response prediction in relation to baseline multimodal parameters and CSFTT response. This study was based on an educated choice of brain regions and features of interest. This was necessary to achieve a trade-off between problem complexity (number of investigated variables) and sample size. CSFTT-related effects outside the considered regions of interest may be present. Finally, the definition of CSFTT responder was based on a percentage cutoff on walking speed and TUG. Although group-comparisons with an alternative cutoff, and correlations between gait changes and variables of interest suggest that our results are not driven by this particular definition, the quantification of clinical improvement after CSFTT remains a matter of debate. Future studies may attempt to use clinical and neuroimaging parameters to predict CSFTT response along multiple clinimetric axes.

### Outcome of modern shunt therapy in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus 6 years postoperatively [^114rLvLX]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Shunt therapy in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) can improve symptoms in 84% of patients 1 year postoperatively. Therefore, implantation of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) prevents or at least prolongs the time during which patients are not dependent on care from others because of gait disorder or dementia. In this study, the medium-term results of modern shunt therapy were evaluated.

Methods

The authors retrospectively studied outcome in iNPH patients in whom VPSs were implanted. At yearly follow-up examinations over at least 6 years, clinical symptoms were recorded according to the NPH recovery rate (NPH-RR): (preoperative Kiefer Scale [KS] score - postoperative KS score)/(preoperative KS score × 10). Time and cause of death over this period were also analyzed.

Results

Among the 147 patients treated for iNPH in the period between 1997 and 2006, 69 had died at the time of the authors' survey. Sixty-one patients reached the 6-year examination. The median age was 64 years (range 33–83 years) at the time of VPS implantation and 73 years (range 41–91 years) at the time of this study. Six years after shunt implantation, the median KS score was significantly lower than the preoperative score (4.3 vs 8.1 points). Fifty-nine percent of 61 patients had an excellent outcome, 15% had satisfactory benefit, and 26% had unsatisfactory results 6 years postoperatively. Three of the 147 patients who underwent implantation of a VPS died of cerebral diseases 4–10 years postoperatively.

Conclusions

Implantation of a VPS is a safe procedure and can improve symptoms in 74% of patients with iNPH in the longer term.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) recommendations — Clinicians may choose to offer shunting as a treatment for patients with iNPH in order to treat their subjective symptoms of iNPH and gait (Level C). Because there is a risk of significant AEs, the risks and benefits of the procedure should be carefully weighed (Level B). Clinicians should inform patients with iNPH with elevated R o that they have an increased chance of responding to shunting compared with those without such elevation (Level B). Clinicians may counsel patients with iNPH that an abnormal CSF-IT or a positive response to repeated TTs increases the chance of response to shunting (Level C). Clinicians may counsel patients with iNPH and their families that increasing age does not necessarily decrease the chance of a shunt being successful (Level C). Clinicians may counsel patients with suspected iNPH and with impaired CBF reactivity to acetazolamide, measured by SPECT, that they are probably more likely to respond to shunting (Level C).

### Outcomes and complications of different surgical treatments for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111pyUYC]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Different CSF diversion procedures (ventriculoperitoneal, ventriculoatrial, and lumboperitoneal shunting) have been utilized for the treatment of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus. More recently, endoscopic third ventriculostomy has been suggested as a reasonable alternative in some studies. The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess overall rates of favorable outcomes and adverse events for each of these treatments. An additional objective was to determine the outcomes and complication rates in relation to the type of valve utilized (fixed vs programmable).

Methods

Multiple databases (PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus) were searched for studies involving patients with idiopathic ventriculomegaly, no secondary cause of hydrocephalus, opening pressure < 25 mm Hg on high-volume tap or drainage trial, and age > 60 years. Outcomes included the proportion of patients who showed improvement in gait, cognition, and bladder function. Adverse events considered in the analysis included postoperative ischemic/hemorrhagic complications, subdural fluid collections, seizures, need for revision surgery, and infection.

Results

A total of 33 studies, encompassing 2461 patients, were identified. More than 75% of patients experienced improvement after shunting, without significant differences among the different techniques utilized. Overall, gait improvement was observed in 75% of patients, cognitive function improvement in more than 60%, and improvement of incontinence in 55%. Adjustable valves were associated with a reduction in revisions (12% vs 32%) and subdural collections (9% vs 22%) as compared to fixed valves.

Conclusions

Outcomes did not differ significantly among different CSF diversion techniques, and overall improvement was reported in more than 75% of patients. The use of programmable valves decreased the incidence of revision surgery and of subdural collections after surgery, potentially justifying the higher initial cost associated with these valves.

### Natural course of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^113fko5r]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

The natural course of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) has not been thoroughly studied. The consequences of postponing shunt treatment are largely unknown. We aimed to describe the effects of waiting for more than 6months before surgery and to compare the outcome with that seen in patients who waited for less than 3months.

Methods

33 patients (iNPHDelayed) underwent an initial investigation (Pre-op 1), followed by re-examination, just prior to surgery, after waiting for at least 6months (Pre-op 2). Outcome was evaluated after 3months of treatment. 69 patients who were surgically treated within 3months after Pre-op 1 and who were also evaluated after 3months of treatment constituted a comparison group (iNPHEarly). Evaluations were done with the iNPH scale and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). iNPHDelayed patients were prospectively studied with regard to outcome, whereas the comparison group iNPHEarly was defined and analysed retrospectively.

Results

iNPHDelayed patients deteriorated significantly during their wait for surgery, with progression of symptom severity ranging from +7 to -47 on the iNPH scale, and from 0 to +3 on the mRS (both p < 0.001). The magnitude of change after surgery was similar in the groups, but since the symptoms of iNPHDelayed patients had worsened while waiting, their final outcome was significantly poorer.

Conclusions

The natural course of iNPH is symptom progression over time, with worsening in gait, balance and cognitive symptoms. This deterioration is only partially reversible. To maximise the benefits of shunt treatment, surgery should be performed soon after diagnosis.

### 5-year health-related quality of life outcome in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^111NTaCc]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Seven studies have evaluated health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) prior to and after cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting (Table 1). A significant heterogeneity exists among the published studies: six different HRQoL instruments were applied, follow-up times ranged from 3 to 45 months and there was a lack of studies replicating and confirming previous findings (Table 1). Factors associated with poorer HRQoL outcome in iNPH in uni- or multivariate analyses have been identified: depressive symptoms, larger comorbidity burden, obesity, hyperlipidemia, severity of gait impairment, post-operative complications and beta amyloid (Aβ) or hyperphosphorylated tau (HPτ) pathology in the frontal cortical biopsy. While five out of seven (71%) studies observed significant HRQoL improvement following CSF shunting, only three studies reported HRQoL improvement rates, that ranged from 43 to 83% (Table 1). These three studies were also the only ones having controls from the general population, two of which compared HRQoL between their cohort and controls. When it comes to improvement of limited dimensions of HRQoL, gender (female) has been associated with greater improvement in mental health and urinary symptoms following surgery. While persons with iNPH having post-operative complications are justifiably thought to report lower HRQoL, only one study has shown difference in HRQoL to those without any complications. Here we aim to report and predict long-term HRQoL outcome in patients with iNPH.

Confirmatory testing includes lumbar puncture (LP), with normal opening pressures (5–18 mm Hg), with an improvement in symptoms following large volume LPs (tap test) highly suggestive of the diagnosis.

The definitive treatment for NPH patients is CSF diversion via shunt placement, with subsequent symptomatic improvement noted in up to 84% of patients. This improvement in clinical symptoms from shunting, particularly gait and cognitive symptoms, allows for differentiation from other progressive conditions with similar presentations, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Binswanger's disease. These clinical improvements can be sustained for years following shunt placement, with gait demonstrating the most marked and sustained symptomatic improvement for 75%–87% of patients. Even for NPH patients requiring shunt revision for shunt malfunction or infection, 74%–93% of patients in the literature have demonstrated long-term improvements in symptomatology following revision surgery.

The underlying pathophysiology of NPH has been of great interest over the years, with various theories presented to account for the underpinnings of its peculiar clinical presentation. While various theories have been proposed since Adams et al's findings to account for the symptomatology and pathophysiology of NPH, a definitive theory of pathogenesis is still lacking. We believe that this stumbling block in understanding the pathophysiology of NPH stems from the larger issue that the existing paradigm of the Monro-Kellie pressure-volume model, from which our fundamental understanding of hydrocephalus is derived, insufficiently accounts for many of the clinical and experimental characteristics associated with different forms of hydrocephalus. There are a myriad of biological processes implicated in NPH, ranging from arteriosclerosis, and impaired blood flow, to impairments in the glymphatic pathway, to disturbances in the distribution of intracranial pulsatility. In this manuscript, we review the various underlying pathophysiological mechanisms underlying NPH and attempt to amalgamate these mechanisms to account for the clinical and radiographic manifestations of this condition.

### Symptoms and signs did not predict outcome after surgery: a prospective study of 143 patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^116yPdfy]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Here, we made a substantial effort to identify clinical variables of predictive value. Our study included well over 100 patients, it was prospective and consecutive, and involved the registration of around 30 different symptoms and signs, comorbidities and BMI. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest study of its kind so far addressing this question.

It has been a major challenge for previous research to predict outcomes after shunt treatment in NPH and to identify the approximate 20% of patients not improved by shunt surgery. Available CSF dynamic or drainage tests all show low negative predictive values and the use of CSF and MRI biomarkers have, so far, not improved the identification of non-responders, which is why better predictive markers are highly warranted. Since the diagnosis of iNPH is based on recognition of the typical clinical syndrome in combination with radiological markers, the use of symptoms and signs for prediction is both practical and appealing.

In our sample of diagnosed and operated iNPH patients, none of the preoperative clinical tests could aid in telling apart patients who later benefitted from shunt surgery from those who did not: comparisons of clinical baseline data between improved and non-improved patients revealed no preoperative differences. The odds ratios for improvement were non-significant for all those baseline variables. Only the anamnestic information of memory impairment being the dominating subjective complaint, was found to have a predictive value, with a lower improvement rate of 44% in that group of 18 patients, compared to 73% in the whole cohort. These 18 patients do not stand out from the remaining cohort of 125 patients with regard to clinical baseline variables: their age was similar, p = 0.58, and they had a median MMSE of 25; IQR 20–27, without significant difference from the remaining cohort, p = 0.21. Neither was any significant difference seen in their preoperative total iNPH scale score, p = 0.54, nor in the neuropsychology or gait domain score of the iNPH scale, p = 0.11 and p = 0.31. Impairment was seen in all four symptom domains of the iNPH scale at baseline in ten of those 18 patients, three domains in four, two domains in three patients, and in one impairment was seen only in the neuropsychology domain.

### Value of biomarkers in the prediction of shunt responsivity in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus [^1168ynUa]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

The limited predictive power of individual biomarkers may reflect their nonspecificity and biological variability. Many of these markers are elevated across a spectrum of neurodegenerative conditions and may not correlate well with dynamic clinical improvements following CSF removal. Furthermore, biomarker levels can be affected by sample handling, timing, and patient-specific pathology (e.g. concurrent Alzheimer's disease), potentially masking true associations.

Clinical measures, particularly the iNPH scale and gait assessment, provide a real-time, functional evaluation of patient status and are more directly responsive to CSF pressure modulation. This may explain why they outperform static biomarkers that reflect underlying pathology but not its reversibility.

When comparing groups, no differences were detected. Although the NfL CSF/serum ratio was 1.75, no difference was found in our study. Importantly, all patients in Group A underwent VP shunt surgery and were systematically evaluated 3 months postoperatively. The INPH scale showed a statistically significant clinical improvement in all cases (median increase: 10.4 points, p = 0.00003). These results substantiate the validity of classifying Group A as true shunt responders based on postoperative clinical outcomes, not just preoperative testing. This provides a solid foundation for subsequent comparison of clinical and biomarker-based predictive models.

One limitation of the present study is that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were obtained exclusively via lumbar puncture. It is known that CSF composition may vary between the ventricular and lumbar compartments due to protein diffusion gradients. However, previous studies in iNPH suggest that while absolute biomarker concentrations can differ, relative trends and diagnostic value are generally preserved. This methodological consideration should be taken into account when interpreting biomarker levels.

Tullberg et al. (2007, 2008) demonstrated that CSF NfL levels decrease following shunt insertion in NPH patients, with the most significant reduction occurring within the first 6–12 months post-surgery. Serum NfL levels are also elevated in NPH patients. Their studies further suggest that NfL dynamics could serve as a potential biomarker to distinguish responders from non-responders after shunt surgery. Some authors have also highlighted its predictive value for shunt responsiveness. However, our study did not confirm these findings.

Materials and methods

Patients

Patient data were retrospectively collected between the years of 2009 and 2016. All research protocols were approved by the local Institutional Review Board. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients in this study. Two patient cohorts were included in this study:
Probable INPH were included to test the diagnostic accuracy of separating responders to CSF drainage from non-responders. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) a diagnosis of probable INPH based on routine radiological reports, characteristic gait, and cognitive symptoms; (ii) completion of gait assessments before and within 2 h after the CSF drainage test via LVLP; and (iii) completion of MRI scans between 1 and 3 months prior to the test. Patients with obstructive hydrocephalus, congenital hydrocephalus, or secondary hydrocephalus were excluded. One hundred four patients were selected according to these criteria, with their demographic and clinical information summarized in Table 1. Thirty-five among them were identified as responders who presented an improvement on the timed up and go (TUG) test by 30% or Tinetti gait assessment by 5 or more points within 2 h after drainage compared to pre-drainage assessments.
A separate cohort of INPH patients was used to test the prognostic accuracy of post-surgical outcomes because we did not have follow-up neurological tests of the responders from the previous cohort. We selected patients who completed Tinetti and/or Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) tests before shunting and within 1 year after shunting and had MRI scans between 0 and 10 months prior to shunting. The exact interval between the tests and shunt surgery and between surgery and MRI scans are provided in Table 2. Forty-seven patients who had complete Tinetti records and 37 patients who had complete MMSE records were included (Table 2).

### Survival in treated idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^114rurbs]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Postoperative outcome and survival

Postoperative improvement in the gait scale or in the mRS was associated with better survival (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.44–0.75 and HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.41–0.75, respectively, p < 0.001 for both). In addition, improvement in these two scales was independent predictors of increased survival, in a multivariable model adjusted for age, sex, and heart disease (improvement in gait: HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45–0.89, p = 0.007 and improvement in mRS: 0.67, 95% CI 0.47–0.89, p = 0.019). No significant effects on survival were seen regarding postoperative improvement in the scales for balance or continence, nor in the MMSE (p = 0.154, p = 0.111, and p = 0.46, respectively).

Next, survival among patients was compared to survival among the controls. The results are presented in Table 4 and Fig. 2. The survival of the 144 patients who improved in both the gait scale and in the mRS did not differ significantly from the survival of the controls (Table 4).

### Instrumented gait analysis for an objective pre-/ postassessment of tap test in normal pressure hydrocephalus [^112pseV1]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To present an objective method to evaluate gait improvements after a tap test in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (INPH).

Design

Retrospective analysis of gait data.

Setting

Public tertiary care center, day hospital. The gait analysis was performed before and 2 to 4 hours after the tap test.

Participants

Participants included patients with INPH (n = 60) and age- and sex-matched controls (n = 50; used to obtain reference intervals). From an initial referred sample of 79 patients (N = 79), we excluded those unable to walk without walking aids (n = 9) and those with incomplete (pre-/posttap test) gait data (n = 10). Thirteen out of 60 patients were shunted and then reappraised after 6 months.

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measures

Mahalanobis distance from controls, before and after the tap test. Eleven gait parameters were combined in a single quantitative score. Walking velocity was also evaluated because it is frequently used in tap test assessment.

Results

Patients were classified into 2 groups: tap test responders (n = 22, 9 of them were shunted) and not suitable for shunt (n = 38, 4 of them were shunted). In the tap test responders group, 9 out of 9 patients improved after shunt. In the not suitable for shunt group, 3 out of 4 patients did not improve. Gait velocity increased after the tap test in 53% of responders and in 37% of patients not suitable for shunt.

Conclusions

The new method is applicable to clinical practice and allows for selecting tap test responders in an objective way, quantifying the improvements. Our results suggest that gait velocity alone is not sufficient to reliably assess tap test effects.

### Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: historical context and a contemporary guide [^112JKDiW]. Practical Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) was described in 1965 as a syndrome in which hydrocephalus develops but with a normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, causing shunt-responsive gait apraxia, cognitive impairment and urinary incontinence. Not all patients respond to shunting despite having the clinical syndrome with appropriate radiological features. This has led to considerable debate over subsequent decades regarding idiopathic NPH. It is now understood that asymptomatic communicating hydrocephalus can develop in many healthy older people, and that over time this can develop into a symptomatic state that sometimes responds to CSF shunting, but to a variable extent. This review looks at the historical background of NPH, the use of predictive tests, the current state of clinical evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic NPH and the possible underlying causes, to provide a contemporary practical guide for assessing patients with the radiological features of idiopathic NPH.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus — predictors of shunt response from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics: B-wave characteristics did not relate to shunt response in multiple studies, while attention focused on outflow resistance R0, defined during the CSF infusion test as R0 = (Pp − Po)/ infusion rate. A Class I study of 142 iNPH patients found no significant correlation between R0 and outcome; in this preselected population, positive predictive value could be as high as 94% but negative predictive value never exceeded 19%. In 17 patients with iNPH, R0 ≥ 12 mm Hg/mL/min was considered abnormal and 2 patients with R0 < 12 still responded; overall, R0 predicted shunt response with p = 0.007 for gait improvement and p = 0.022 for total NPH score. In multivariate analysis of 95 NPH patients, R0 ≥ 18 was the only significant predictor (odds ratio 4.39, 95% CI 1.25–16.7). A retrospective series of 55 shunted NPH patients found no CSF variable differences between responders and nonresponders; selection criteria included plateau pressure > 22 mm Hg, and R0 correlated with plateau pressure (r = 0.63).

### Background risk factors associated with shunt intervention for possible idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a nationwide hospital-based survey in Japan [^114dnDSz]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

A nation-wide survey was conducted on patients that 1) were 60 years or older, 2) presented with enlargement of the brain ventricles, and 3) had one or more of the following symptoms: gait disturbances, cognitive impairments, or urinary incontinence. These were considered to be cases of possible iNPH, per Japanese guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of iNPH. This survey was a primary survey to patients with a diagnosis of iNPH who also received medical care during 2012. Next, we administered a secondary survey to clarify the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes in these cases. In addition, we separately asked the attending, treating physicians to confirm specific clinical details via a posted questionnaire (Supplementary Table 1). Using the survey data, we analyzed the risk associated with various factors in surgically-treated patients with iNPH in Japan.

In the first survey, 4,220 of a total 14,089 hospitals (459 university hospitals, 13,582 general hospitals, and 48 special stratified hospitals) were extracted and an epidemiological investigation was carried out by mail. In the primary survey, responses were obtained from 1,804 clinical departments (recovery rate: 42.7%); 3,079 patients met the diagnostic criteria for iNPH per Japanese diagnostic guidelines.

Of the 1,495 patients who were enrolled and completed both surveys, 193 had unknown mRS grades and 460 did not undergo shunt placement. These patients were excluded from the analyses (see the flow chart in Fig. 1). After exclusions, a total of 842 patients with possible iNPH (511 men and 331 women; median age (25%–75%), 77 (73–80) years) were included in the analyses (Table 1). These patients were divided into two groups according to surgical outcome: the "improvement" group included patients who showed at least a one-point improvement mRS grade after treatment. The "non-improvement" group included patients with no change or an increase in mRS grade after treatment.

INTRODUCTION

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by gait disturbance, dementia, and urinary incontinence. Independence in everyday life and improvements in cognitive functions in patients with iNPH can be achieved through shunt treatment. In Japan, an iNPH guideline was published ahead of the Western world in 2004, and revised in 2011. This guideline noted that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt intervention in patients with possible iNPH on MRI resulted in an improvement in the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score in > 80% of the patients within a year. Additional improvements were also observed in the following symptoms: gait disturbance with a wide short-stepped gait; cognitive impairment resulting in decreased psychomotor speed; urinary urgency; overactive bladder manifesting mainly as urinary incontinence; ventricular enlargement; narrowing of the high convexity in the subarachnoid space; and disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid-space hydrocephalus (DESH) with CSF retention in the subarachnoid space under the sylvian fissure. These positive results support the use of the diagnosis techniques recommended in the iNPH guideline. CSF shunting is currently approved as the only treatment method for iNPH with evidence of efficacy; however, the long-term effects of shunt intervention are still in question. Additionally, the treatment outcome can be affected by the presence of various complications in the elderly.

### Survival in treated idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^1117QCbr]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In this registry study of 979 iNPH patients who underwent surgery in Sweden, mortality is increased 1.8 times compared to the general population. Preoperative symptom severity is linked to mortality, especially for gait and cognition (MMSE). Postoperative improvement in gait or in functional independence (mRS) is associated with longer survival. The survival of iNPH patients who improve in both the gait scale and in the modified Rankin Scale is similar to that of controls from the general population, indicating that shunt surgery for iNPH besides improving the symptoms and signs can normalize survival.

### CSF tap test in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: still a necessary prognostic test? [^114hpm3e]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

To conclude, our negative results show that single clinical or neuroimaging parameters do not predict CSFTT outcome, indirectly supporting its utility as prognostic tool. Multivariable classification analyses highlight the value of combining clinical and imaging features to achieve robust, although moderate prediction accuracy of CSFTT outcome which, however, does not stand for replacing the standard CSFTT procedure. RSP classification sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 75% and 64%, indicating that gait and WM parameters together can help identifying patients more likely to experience short-term symptom reversibility but cannot exclude patients from further CSFTT. These results strongly encourage future investigations on the multivariable predictive value of gait and WM features for shunt surgery outcome.

### Ventriculoperitoneal shunting of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus increases midbrain size: a potential mechanism for gait improvement [^112aggqq]. Neurosurgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (INPH) is characterized by a classic clinical triad of symptoms, including dementia, urinary incontinence, and gait disturbance. Recent work has demonstrated that the maximal midbrain anteroposterior (AP) diameter is significantly smaller in patients with INPH than in healthy, age-matched controls. The current study was undertaken to determine the effect of ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement on midbrain dimensions in INPH patients.

Methods

Twelve consecutive INPH patients undergoing ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement with pre- and postoperative computed tomographic scans at the Columbia University Medical Center were enrolled. Each patient's pre- and postoperative maximum AP and left-to-right diameters of the midbrain at the pontomesencephalic junction were independently measured in a blinded fashion by two of the authors. The average value of each dimension was computed by calculating the mean values of the measurements of the two observers.

Results

Both the mean AP diameter (preoperative mean, 2.06 ± 0.04 cm; postoperative mean, 2.27 ± 0.05; P = 0.0007) and left-to-right diameter (preoperative mean, 2.80 ± 0.07; postoperative mean, 3.03 ± 0.08; P = 0.0029) increased from pre- to postoperative imaging. The approximate cross-sectional area determined as the product of AP and left-to-right diameters also increased from pre- to postoperative images (preoperative mean, 5.79 ± 0.22 cm; postoperative mean, 6.90 ± 0.25 cm; P = 0.00049).

Conclusion

This study provides supportive evidence that midbrain cytoarchitecture may play a role in the pathophysiology and post-ventriculoperitoneal shunt gait improvement of INPH patients.

### Clinical improvement after shunt surgery in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus can Be quantified by diffusion tensor imaging [^1172gRrq]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

White matter changes assessed by DTI typically reflect tract functionality. This study aimed to investigate DTI parameter alterations in important regions pre- and postshunt implantation in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), alongside assessing the relationship between DTI parameters and clinical improvement.

Materials and Methods

Patients with probable iNPH underwent prospective preoperative MRI and comprehensive clinical work-up between 2017–2022. Patients with clinical symptoms of iNPH, positive result on a lumbar infusion test, and/or gait improvement after 120-hour lumbar drainage were diagnosed with iNPH and underwent shunt-placement surgery. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity values for individual regions of interest were extracted from preoperative and postoperative MRI. These values were correlated with the clinical picture of individual patients.

Results

A total of 32 patients (73.59 ± 4.59years) with definite iNPH were analyzed. Preoperative DTI characteristics of internal capsule and corona radiata correlated with the 1-year improvement in the Dutch Gait Scale postoperatively (all P < .036). Cognitive domain improvement after surgery in memory and psychomotor speed correlated with preoperative DTI values of cingulate gyrus (P = .050), uncinate fasciculus (P = .029), superior longitudinal fasciculus (P = .020), or corpus callosum (P < .045).

Conclusions

DTI characteristics of white matter regions reflect clinical improvement after shunt surgery in patients with iNPH. They tend to improve toward physiologic DTI values, thus further accentuating the benefit of shunt surgery in both clinical and radiologic pictures.

Fig. 1
Flow chart for this study from the initial screening to the final analysis. iNPH, idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus; PD, Parkinson's disease; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid

For patient selection, we used the following criteria based on international standards and actual conditions: (1) age ≥ 60 years; (2) ≥ 1 clinical manifestations of the triad of gait disorder, cognitive impairment, and urinary incontinence; (3) manifestations of ventricular enlargement (EI ≥ 0.3) on imaging, with the exclusion of other diseases that may cause it, such as traumatic brain injury, various types of cerebral hemorrhage, brain tumors, encephalitis, meningitis, and large-area cerebral infarction, among others; (4) CSF pressure ≤ 200 mmH 2 O on lumbar puncture, with normal CSF biochemical examination results; (5) positive response on the CSF tap test; and (6) no severe cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and other diseases that are contraindications for surgery. In addition, all patients underwent head MRI examination within 1 month before surgery, and a ventricular-abdominal shunt was selected for surgery.

Clinical evaluation

All patients underwent comprehensive clinical examinations by a neurologist preoperatively and 12 months postoperatively according to standardized protocols. To evaluate the outcomes of shunt surgery, we used the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) to assess the general level of disability and the overall situation; the iNPH grading scale (iNPHGS) can be used to evaluate individual symptoms related to the triad of gait, cognition, and urination, and its total score represents the overall severity of clinical symptoms. The primary outcome was an improvement in mRS ≥ 1 points (favorable outcome) a year after surgery, and the secondary outcome was an improvement in iNPHGS ≥ 1 point a year after surgery. We examined the effect of preoperative neuroimaging features on these two scores.

### Value of biomarkers in the prediction of shunt responsivity in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus [^116rgyz3]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Missing data were minimal (< 5%) and handled using pairwise deletion to preserve statistical power while minimizing bias. Logistic regression was employed due to its interpretability and suitability for identifying the predictive value of individual variables. To capture potential non- linear relationships and interactions, Random Forest modeling was also applied. Cross- validation was used to assess generalizability and reduce overfitting.

The homogeneity of variances between the two groups during the analysis was evaluated using Levene's test. The chi-square test was utilized to assess differences in postoperative gait – improvement. Mann–Whitney U Test was employed to compare differences in the INPH scale between groups and in the levels of biomarkers. Descriptive Statistics was employed to calculate means, medians, standard deviations, interquartile range. ROC analysis, cross- validation and Random Forest model were employed for assessment of predictive value with calculation of AUC.

### Placebo-controlled effectiveness of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus shunting: a randomized pilot trial [^117LFnJY]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Limitations and Generalizability

Although this trial succeeded in demonstrating the feasibility and possible outcomes of a controlled iNPH trial, this pilot study demonstrated several weaknesses that helped us to design a larger clinical trial now initiated. A key vulnerability in the feasibility of a clinical trial is the potential for low enrollment with low patient diversity. Of the potential trial candidates who were screened before CSF testing, 85% failed criteria, most often being excluded because of poor cognitive function, high initial gait velocity, or concurrent treatment with anticoagulants. After review of these excluding factors, in future enrollment, cognitive decline will be accepted if it does not interfere with standard institutional consent criteria or interfere with ability to cooperate and communicate for the testing. Similarly, other comorbidities will be accepted if they are judged to not interfere with the testing process. Because patients with iNPH with comorbidities are accepted in general practice, their inclusion in the forthcoming larger clinical trial will help optimize enrollment, and patient selection will be more closely aligned with general practice.

A recognized barrier to enrollment in clinical trials is refusal by patients to consent to participate. Although the 57% rate of consent observed in this pilot study is encouraging, the main patient concern identified was the potential of a 4-month treatment delay. After review, the potential treatment delay has now been shortened to 3 months. The study group consensus is that this should not affect the study aims but may allow for increased willingness to participate in the upcoming clinical trial. Finally, changes to the study design for the future, larger multicenter clinical trial will allow recruitment from a larger iNPH patient population that will also include an outreach awareness program to reach caregivers and patients in diverse communities, to facilitate an increase in the diversity of participation.

The results of this small pilot study demonstrate the feasibility of a unique study design and have resulted in key methodological changes in measurement and recruitment that will optimize the success of the larger forthcoming clinical trial. This National Institute of Neurological Disorder supported trial titled "Placebo-controlled Effectiveness of iNPH Shunting Trial" (U01NS122764), with 20 centers in the United States, Canada, England, and Sweden, has been initiated. Importantly, evaluation of CSF content, MR imaging, extended neurocognitive, and other gait features are also included in this new clinical trial to investigate their role in diagnosis and shunt-treatment prognosis.

### Intracranial compartment volumes in normal pressure hydrocephalus: volumetric assessment versus outcome [^111cJFvZ]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Although enlargement of the cerebral ventricles plays a central role in the diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), there are no reports on the use of volumetric assessment to distinguish between patients who respond to ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery and those who do not. The purpose of this study is to explore the association between preoperative intracranial compartment volumes and postoperative improvement.

Methods

Twenty-six patients (17 men; mean age, 75 years [range, 54–87 years]) with a clinical or radiologic suspicion of NPH were included in the study. Gait, cognition, and bladder function were evaluated by clinical rating. MR imaging of the brain was acquired at 0.5 T and 1.5 T. Total intracranial volume, ventricular volume, brain volume, and pericerebral CSF volume were determined by volumetric assessment. Four imaging variables were determined: ventricular volume ratio, brain volume ratio, pericerebral CSF volume ratio, and the ratio of ventricular volume to pericerebral CSF volume. All patients underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery.

Results

Clinical follow-up was assessed 1 year after shunt surgery. No difference in the mean ventricular volume ratio, the mean brain volume ratio, the mean pericerebral CSF volume ratio, and the mean ratio between ventricular and pericerebral CSF volume was found between subjects who improved on gait or cognition or bladder function and those who did not.

Conclusion

Volumetric assessment has no predictive value in differentiating between NPH patients who respond to ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery and those who do not.

### Ventricular volume is more strongly associated with clinical improvement than the Evans index after shunting in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^116PLC8d]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Ventricular enlargement in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus is often estimated using the Evans index. However, the sensitivity of the Evans index to estimate changes in ventricular size postoperatively has been questioned. Here, we evaluated the postoperative change in ventricle size in relation to shunt response in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus, by comparing ventricular volume and the Evans index.

Materials and Methods

Fifty-seven patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus underwent high-resolution MR imaging preoperatively and 6 months after shunt insertion. Clinical symptoms of gait, balance, cognition, and continence were assessed according to the idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus scale. The ventricular volume of the lateral and third ventricles and the Evans index were measured using ITK-SNAP software. Semiautomatic volumetric analysis was performed, and postoperative changes in ventricular volume and the Evans index and their relationships to postoperative clinical improvement were compared.

Results

The median postoperative ventricular volume decrease was 25 mL (P < .001). The proportional decrease in ventricular volume was greater than that in the Evans index (P < .001). The postoperative decrease in ventricular volume was associated with a postoperative increase in the idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus scale score (P = .004). Shunt responders (75%) demonstrated a greater ventricular volume decrease than nonresponders (P = .002).

Conclusions

Clinical improvement after shunt surgery in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus is associated with a reduction of ventricular size. Ventricular volume is a more sensitive estimate than the Evans index and, therefore, constitutes a more precise method to evaluate change in ventricle size after shunt treatment in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus.

### Beyond early motor response: longitudinal cognitive and gait assessments after extended lumbar drainage in normal pressure hydrocephalus [^113JVNRg]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a multifactorial progressive disease affecting cognition, gait, and urinary continence, potentially reversible, or at least improvable, by a prompt surgical intervention. Given its potential surgical improvement, it is crucial to determine who will benefit of a ventriculo‐peritoneal shunt. To date, although several procedures are considered useful to diagnose iNPH, there is no agreement concerning the best timing of the clinical assessment or the role played by formal cognitive testing.

Methods

Thirty participants with suspected iNPH were assessed at baseline, 2, and 15 days after 24‐h extended lumbar drainage (ELD). Timed Up and Go test (TUG), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) were administered in order to quantify motor and cognitive performances. The TUG was used to assess clinical response to ELD.

Results

Our sample showed significant differences between baseline assessment and follow‐ups in the majority of tests. Although some enhancements in performances appeared in the first post‐ELD assessment, both treatment responders and non‐responders showed better performances in the delayed assessment. Post hoc comparison found significant differences in each time point between the two groups.

Conclusions

These results emphasize the key role of performing multiple assessments post CSF drainage, as response can be more prominent in a delayed rather than an early phase.

### Advancing treatment strategies for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a systematic review on studies comparing ventricular and lumbo-peritoneal shunts [^117BxVBj]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Additionally, all studies but for 1 reported the use of programmable valves for both LPS and VPS group, of which only 1 reported specific values of pressure-settings exclusively limited to the LPS group, with a mean of 13.5 ± 3.9 cm H 2 O.

Finally, Kobayashi et al. in 2022 confirmed comparable results between the two surgical techniques as regard to long-term improvement in gait, cognitive performance, and urinary function. Additionally, these authors explored risk factors for unfavorable outcomes, showing that hypertension and longer disease duration negatively impacted the outcomes in both groups.

Taken together, these findings demonstrate that LPS and VPS are associated with similar rates of clinical improvement. However, LPS apparently shows a lower complication rate, making it a viable option in patients at higher risk of procedural complications for VPS.

Quantitative analysis (meta-analysis)

Due to data limitations, a meta-analysis was feasible only for outcomes reported in 4 out of 6 of the included studies. According to the global clinical outcome improvement, defined as a progression in at least one clinical domain (gait, cognition, urinary) at 6-month follow-up, LPS and VPS showed comparable outcomes (OR = 0.912; 95%CI:0.719–1.158; p = 0.4; I² = 0%).

In particular, a gait control improvement was the most frequently reported good outcome, with no significant difference between LPS and VPS (OR = 0.898; 95%CI:0.521–1.547; p = 0.7; I² = 0% — Fig. 3).

### Management of idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus: a multiinstitutional study conducted in Japan [^117B2sZc]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2001). Low credibility.

Object

A cooperative study was undertaken to identify factors that could be used to predict a favorable outcome after extracranial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion (shunting) in patients with suspected idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH).

Methods

Questionnaires concerning patients with suspected idiopathic NPH were sent to 14 members of the Committee for Scientific Research on Intractable Hydrocephalus, sponsored by the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan. After the questionnaires were returned, a retrospective analysis of the responses was undertaken. To be included in the study, patients had to be 65 years of age or older and had to have undergone surgery between October 1995 and October 1998. Clinical measures included degrees of gait disturbance, dementia, and urinary incontinence as evaluated before. 3 months after, and 3 years after shunt placement. Diagnostic tests in various combinations included lumbar puncture in which CSF was withdrawn; intracranial pressure monitoring; measurements of CSF outflow resistance, level of serum alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, cerebral arteriovenous differences of oxygen content, and cerebral blood flow; and computerized tomography cisternography. In this study, 120 patients were identified as having idiopathic NPH and these patients underwent placement of shunts. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt with a programmable valve was used in two thirds of the patients. At the end of 3 months (early assessment), there was an 80% overall rate of clinical improvement, which dropped to 73.3% of the 105 patients who could be evaluated at the end of the 3-year study. Of the three variables, gait disturbance was most improved, both at early and late testing periods. Shunt complications occurred in 22 (18.3%) of the patients.

Conclusions

Patients suspected of having idiopathic NPH did not form a homogeneous group, making it difficult to select those who would most likely respond to CSF diversion. Of the diagnostic studies, the most reliable result was improvement in clinical symptoms following a lumbar puncture in which CSF was withdrawn. The use of a programmable valve is recommended because it offers advantages in preventing problems of over- and underdrainage.

### The necessity of gait evaluation on the 7th day after tap tests for the idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus patients [^111d9Fdn]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is an adult-onset disease with enlarged ventricles of unknown etiology. It is characterized by the classical Hakim's triad of gait disturbance, cognitive impairment, and urinary incontinence, which are expected to be improved by shunt surgery. The effect of shunt surgeries can be predicted by a tap test, widely used to determine the indication of surgical treatment. In a tap test, 30–50 mL of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is withdrawn, and then the patient is evaluated before and after to determine if the symptoms are improved. There have been only a limited number of reports on the duration of symptomatic follow-up after tap tests. Matsuoka et al. reported that cognitive function should be measured up to 7 days after the tap test, and Schniepp et al. reported that the best time to evaluate gait improvement could be 2 days after the test. In our institutional protocol, the result of a tap test is marked as positive if the patient experiences certain improvement in any of the clinical evaluations on the 1st, 3rd, and 7th days after the test. We have frequently experienced patients whose gait is not improved 1 or 3 days after the tap test but is improved only seven days after. We conducted this study to determine the necessity of checking the gait on the 7th day after tap tests.

### Clinimetric properties and minimal clinically important differences for a battery of gait, balance, and cognitive examinations for the tap test in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^111UzgCB]. Neurosurgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is treated by insertion of a ventricular peritoneal (VP) shunt. To help identify who would benefit from a VP shunt, patients undergo a tap test (TT). Several measures can identify change from a TT, but the magnitude of change and the combination of measures that indicate the improvement from a TT is unclear.

Objective

To develop minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) for a battery of gait, balance, and cognitive measures in relation to improvement from the TT, and to identify which combination of measures best identifies when improvement has occurred.

Methods

Observational study of iNPH patients undergoing a TT for consideration of a VP shunt. Patients completed the: The Timed Up and Go (TUG), Timed Up and Go cognition (TUG-C), Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment (Tinetti), and Berg Balance Scale (BBS) pre- and post-TT. A Global Rating of Change scale assessed patients' perceived improvements in gait and balance post-TT.

Results

MCIDs for the TT were (calculated as percentage changes): TUG: 13%, TUG-C: 11% Tinetti: 36%, and BBS: 20%. A combination of the TUG-C and Tinetti resulted in sensitivity of 90.28% to identify improvement, while the Tinetti and BBS resulted in specificity of 98.58% to exclude improvement from a TT.

Conclusion

These MCIDs provide the first evidence to quantify the significance of post-TT symptom changes and provides objective data to guide recommendations for clinical management. Utilizing a combination of measures, and these MCIDs as cut off values, results in high sensitivity and specificity for identifying improvement from a TT.

### Normal pressure hydrocephalus combined with quadruple misfolded proteinopathy: an autopsy case report and a short review of literature [^112Y8QME]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Second, we believe that at least a subset of patients with comorbid NPH and proteinopathies may partially benefit from timely shunt surgery. The effectiveness and adverse events of shunt surgery in NPH patients has long been a subject of controversy. This is particularly true for NPH patients with complex comorbidities. A comparative study found that the long-term efficacy of CSF shunt surgery in NPH patients is nearly 75%, with approximately 93% of these patients showing initial improvement in gait. In another retrospective study, it was found that in patients with complex NPH comorbid with other neurodegenerative diseases, the cognitive improvement following shunt surgery was less significant compared to patients with classic NPH. It has been reported that the results of cortical brain biopsies and the presence of ADNC are strongly associated with the outcome of CSF shunting. Moreover, multiple studies have reported that gait improvement in NPH patients after shunt surgery is greater than the improvement in cognitive function. The patient's response to treatment in this case was also consistent with other reports about NPH combined with neurodegeneration, that is she partially benefited from lumbar puncture, but symptoms eventually worsened over time. Patients with the double diagnosis share common clinical features of both NPH and neurodegeneration, including the efficacy of shunt surgery. Shunt surgery may achieve its therapeutic effect by clearing solute neurotoxic proteins in the brain. Symptoms in these patients may ultimately worsen due to the inability to clear aggregated and deposited abnormal proteins. Therefore, the intrinsic link between NPH and proteinopathies may partly explain why shunt surgery is sometimes ineffective and why cognitive improvement is often limited. Based on the treatment response in this case, we advocate using the tap test to predict the effectiveness of shunt surgery, and timely surgical intervention may significantly improve the patient's quality of life.

### Parkinsonian symptoms in normal pressure hydrocephalus: a population-based study [^114CmDGL]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Parkinsonian symptomatology exists in addition to the classical triad of gait, cognitive, and urinary symptoms in normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), and may complicate the diagnostic considerations. Radiology of the brain is essential to diagnose NPH, with typical findings of dilated ventricles without any macroscopic obstruction to cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) flow, often with signs of compressed cortical sulci combined with focally enlarged sulci. NPH is a treatable condition; in about 80% of the patients, the symptoms improve after surgical treatment with CSF shunt.

The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is a widely used rating scale for Parkinson's disease (PD) and the motor examination part (UPDRS-m) has also been used to rate parkinsonian motor symptoms in NPH patients. In the previous hospital-based studies, upper body bradykinesia has been described in 62% and parkinsonism in up to 71% of NPH patients. Significant improvements in the total UPDRS-m score have been described after shunt surgery and after CSF removal by lumbar puncture (CSF tap test). Mild parkinsonian signs in the four categories bradykinesia, tremor at rest, rigidity, and postural/gait changes are found in 20–40% of the older population. Except from neurodegenerative diseases, factors associated with normal aging as well as comorbidities such as cerebrovascular disease and essential tremor may contribute to findings of isolated parkinsonian signs.

As parkinsonian features are important in the differential diagnosis of neurological disorders, we wanted to describe the frequency of such symptoms and compare the UPDRS-m score between individuals from the general population with and without signs of NPH. Furthermore, we wanted to find out whether there was a relationship between UPDRS-m score, NPH symptoms, and radiological signs of NPH.

### Safety and efficacy of gravitational shunt valves in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a pragmatic, randomised, open label, multicentre trial (SVASONA) [^11516sUx]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Participants

We enrolled consecutive patients who gradually developed gait disturbance unexplainable by other health conditions, and showed at least one other clinical sign of the Hakim's triad suggesting the presence of iNPH (dementia and incontinence).

Eligible patients had to demonstrate a communicating hydrocephalus with enlarged lateral ventricles, equalling an Evans Index of 0.3 or higher, as verified by CT or MRI. The Evans Index is defined as the maximum frontal horn ventricular width divided by the transverse inner diameter of the skull in the same slice. A ratio of 0.3 or higher represents the classic threshold for diagnosing ventriculomegaly.

Also, at least one positive result out of the following pattern of invasive tests was required for patient inclusion: (1) resistance to outflow (R out) of 13 mm Hg/min×ml or more in the lumbar CSF infusion test,(2) clinical improvement after a lumbar spinal tap or (3) positive B wave analysis.

We excluded patients with secondary NPH due to bleeding or infection, cerebral parenchymal lesions on CT or MRI scans, or any contraindication for surgery. Patients were also excluded if, according to the screening physician's judgment, they were unlikely to attend the planned follow-up visits. This included long distance travel, impaired mobility, low compliance or a presumed limited remaining lifespan.

The trial protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of the coordinating centre (Charité Medical University Centre, Berlin, Germany, EA1/165/06) and all collaborating institutions. The study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and federal medical device regulations. All devices employed in the study were approved for clinical use under European laws.

Randomisation

After obtaining written informed consent from patients or their closest relatives, participants were randomised in a 1:1 fashion to either treatment group using a block randomisation plan (using theonline random sequence generator). Computer generated random lists and sealed envelopes were prepared by the central statistical unit and distributed to the collaborating institutions. For practical reasons and because of varying access to high speed internet connections in the operating theatres of the collaborating centres, we preferred the envelope approach over a web based randomisation tool. Sealed envelopes were opened immediately before surgery in the operating theatre. A treatment allocation sheet signed by a surgeon was faxed to the coordinating site to ensure that treatment assignment at individual centres matched the original randomisation sequence.

### Rapidly progressive dementia and ataxia in an elderly man [^112hXVrM]. Practical Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

A particular variety of chronic communicating hydrocephalus in the elderly has been called 'normal pressure', because the CSF pressure at a random single lumbar puncture is normal. It causes major diagnostic difficulties in elderly demented patients who are also off-balance and incontinent, as this particular triad of neurological problems, together with an enlarged ventricular system can be due to a neurodegenerative disease with cerebral atrophy, rather than to normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH).

Could this patient's problems be due to (communicating) hydrocephalus, as suggested by the brain MRI report, and could it be of the normal pressure variety? While his clinical syndrome (dementia+ataxia) is consistent with NPH, most patients with dementia and ataxia do not have NPH, even if they have the third component of the NPH triad (incontinence). Studies that simply document gait disturbance, dementia, incontinence and ventriculomegaly probably overestimate the prevalence of NPH, which is probably equal to that of progressive supranuclear palsy. Typically, NPH patients have subcortical/frontal cognitive dysfunction, most affected being memory, executive function, attention and psychomotor speed. The neuropsychological profile can improve after shunt insertion. However, other studies have found that while gait mght improve initially, incontinence and cognitive features do not improve following shunt insertion, suggesting a high degree of overdiagnosis. There is no definitive test for NPH. There are several supplemental tests to assist diagnosis, including the 'CSF tap test' (large-volume lumbar puncture), external CSF drainage by spinal drainage and CSF outflow determination with CSF infusion compliance studies. However, these tests have variable sensitivities and specificities. The CSF tap test has a low sensitivity 26–61%. Clinical response to CSF removal by spinal catheter has a higher sensitivity 50–100%, specificity 60–100% and positive predictive value 80–100%. However, it is an invasive procedure, requires expert management, and has a high complication rate.

The rate of progression in this patient, over weeks, seems too rapid for NPH, which usually evolves over months to years. So if there really is communicating hydrocephalus, but is not of the normal pressure variety, what else could be causing it? One would have to think of infective or neoplastic causes.

### Systematic volumetric analysis predicts response to CSF drainage and outcome to shunt surgery in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^112iUCUu]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study investigated the role of systematic volumetric analysis for the diagnosis of INPH shunt candidates as assessed by their response to CSF drainage and prediction of neurological outcomes after shunt placement. We achieved a high diagnostic accuracy of 0.94 in discriminating CSF drainage responders from non-responders in a cohort of probable INPH patients. The volumetric analysis also showed promising performance in predicting the gait and cognitive outcomes after shunt placement, with high correlations with the ground truth (r = 0.80–0.93).

Compared to the existing volumetric studies in INPH, our automated segmentation pipeline parcellates the brain into 283 structures, and the fine elements can be grouped into different granularity levels according to their ontological relationship, tailored to different studies. Our results demonstrated that the diagnostic and prognostic accuracy increased as the granularity level increased, illustrating the importance of fine segmentation. Another unique advantage is that our atlas definition was not only limited to GM and WM but also the ventricle and sulcal regions, e.g. 12 ventricular ROIs and 18 sulcal ROIs (Supplementary Table S1). This can be particularly useful for INPH studies, as the pattern of CSF distribution is an important marker of INPH. Note that image acquisition protocols slightly differed among patients, but it was unlikely to affect the results, as the segmentation pipeline has shown to be robust against protocols and highly reproducible in our previous studies.

### Symptoms and signs did not predict outcome after surgery: a prospective study of 143 patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^111wnZhn]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

All clinical variables were assessed pre- and postoperatively. All examinations were performed within the frame of routine care. The majority of the patients were assessed by the same specialist neuropsychologist and physiotherapist, and consultant or resident neurologists, in the latter case supervised by consultants.

At the baseline evaluation patients and/or their next-of-kin were interviewed about the duration of symptoms perceived as iNPH symptoms. They were also asked which was the first presenting symptom (impaired gait/balance/memory/continence, several simultaneously, headache, or other), and about the dominating subjective complaint at present (impaired gait/balance/memory/continence, headache, or other).

Treatment

The insertion of ventriculoperitoneal shunts was performed in 139 patients, and ventriculo-atrial shunts in four patients. The choice of operation technique was based on the surgeons' assessment of individual patients' prerequisites. PS Medical Strata, Medtronic (Goleta, California, USA) valves with an antisiphon device (ASD) and a standard setting of 1.5 were used in all cases.

All shunts were deemed working at the postoperative assessment. Shunt function was assessed by evaluation of clinical symptoms and CT or MRI. If doubts regarding shunt patency remained following CT or MRI, a radionuclide shuntography or a lumbar infusion test was performed.

Complications

Before the postoperative follow-up, 12 patients (8.4%) had complications following shunt surgery. Eight patients (5.6%) had major complications requiring new surgery: six had distal mechanical shunt failures (misplacement or obstruction) corrected by surgical revisions, one had a subdural hematoma requiring surgical evacuation and temporary ligation of the shunt, and one had a CNS infection requiring extraction and later reinsertion of a shunt. Four patients (2.8%) had minor complications: two had hygromas requiring upregulation of their shunt valve opening pressure, one had both septicemia related to a urinary catheter placement and gastrointestinal bleeding, prompting termination of antithrombotic treatment, and one had a postoperative transient fever.

Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patients consents

The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Gothenburg (Dnr 328–14, T439–15). All patients or their next of kin gave written consent to inclusion in the study.

### Postoperative changes in ventricular cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers with correlation to clinical outcome in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^114nUisF]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

The prediction of shunt response has been investigated previously, with varying results. Some have found that biomarkers do not contribute to the prediction of outcome. Here, changes in biomarker concentrations did not contribute to the overall response to shunt treatment. A combination of all biomarkers in a multivariate regression did not contribute further to outcome prediction for the total symptom burden relief.

Reduced levels of precursor proteins of the amyloid cascade (sAβPP) and Aβ were seen in iNPH patients compared to healthy controls, which was interpreted as a sign of reduced amyloid metabolism due to sAβPP production decrease or in combination with the reduced clearance of molecules by iNPH-specific retrograde CSF dynamics. Some studies suggest sAβPP are decreased in shunt responders, while others suggest an increase. Amyloid proteins in ventricular CSF have previously been found to increase after shunt treatment, which was also shown here. Low levels of Aβ 42 have previously been described as an indicator of poor shunt response due to increased amyloid plaque burden, and as a biomarker indicator of plaques the Aβ 42 is inversely correlated with increasing plaque burden. The relative increase in iNPH patients could still be considered low when compared to AD or healthy controls. Ultimately, the suggested restoration of amyloid metabolism here seems to correlate with improvement, with high levels in precursor protein AβPPβ as well as increases of Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 to explain the reduced symptom burden, in line with the findings described by Jeppsson et al. (2013, 2016) where amyloid proteins were decreased in ventricular CSF perioperatively and increased postoperatively, although the findings were not considered in the light of possible subdomain symptom burden there. Some suggest low Aβ 40 is connected to gait. Here, AβPPβ levels were increased levels among patients with better gait upon diagnosis and at follow-up, and increasing improvement in gait and urinary continence was shown with a greater increase in Aβ 40 and Aβ 42. AβPPβ, a biomarker also suggested to have a role in synaptic plasticity, could also suggest a synaptic mechanism for gait impairment, although synaptic biomarkers GAP43 and neurogranin did not contribute to improvement, which challenges the theory.

### Gait and balance measures can identify change from a cerebrospinal fluid tap test in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^114eh9aj]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To identify in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) undergoing a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tap test (TT) for consideration of a ventricular peritoneal (VP) shunt: (1) gait and balance measures, which identify symptom change; (2) differences present between pre- and post-CSF TT scores between patients classified as responders and nonresponder; (3) ability of patients with iNPH to accurately quantify change in their gait and balance symptoms from a CSF TT.

Design

Prospective observational study. Post-CSF TT assessment was completed 2–4 hours post.

Setting

Tertiary referral neurological and neurosurgical hospital.

Participants

Patients (N = 74) with iNPH receiving a 30 mL CSF TT for consideration of a VP shunt.

Interventions

Patients underwent a battery of gait and balance measures pre- and post-CSF TT and indicated their perceived change on a global rating of change (GRC). Patients deemed to improve and offered VP shunt insertion by a neurologist or neurosurgeon were labeled responders.

Main Outcome Measures

Performance oriented mobility assessment (Tinetti), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), timed Up and Go (TUG), 10-meter walk test (10MWT), GRC.

Results

Forty patients were classified responders, 34 nonresponders. Significant differences were identified for responders: Tinetti (3.88 points), TUG (3.98 seconds), 10MWT (0.08 m/sec), and BBS (5.29 points). Significant differences were found for nonresponders for the Tinetti (0.91 points) and BBS (2.06 points). Change scores for responders and nonresponders were significantly different for all tests between responders and nonresponders. GRC scores for gait (+2 for responders, 0 for nonresponders) and balance (+2.5 for responders, 0 for nonresponders) were both significantly different.

Conclusions

The Tinetti, BBS, and TUG can identify change in patients undergoing a CSF TT for iNPH. Patients appear to be able to accurately identify if change has occurred.

### Lack of shunt response in suspected idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus with Alzheimer disease pathology [^113Q6QjS]. Annals of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

To determine the impact of cortical Alzheimer disease pathology on shunt responsiveness in individuals treated for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), 37 patients clinically diagnosed with iNPH participated in a prospective study in which performance on neurologic, psychometric, and gait measures before and 4 months after shunting was correlated with amyloid β plaques, neuritic plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles observed in cortical biopsies obtained during shunt insertion. No complications resulted from biopsy acquisition. Moderate to severe pathology was associated with worse baseline cognitive performance and diminished postoperative improvement on NPH symptom severity scales, gait measures, and cognitive instruments compared to patients lacking pathology.

### Value of MRI-based semi-quantitative structural neuroimaging in predicting the prognosis of patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus after shunt surgery [^116pNBpc]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To explore the value of structural neuroimaging in predicting the prognosis of shunt surgery for idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) using two different standard semi-quantitative imaging scales.

Methods

A total of 47 patients with iNPH who underwent shunt surgery at our hospital between 2018 and 2020 were included in this study. The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and iNPH grading scale (iNPHGS) were used to evaluate and quantify the clinical symptoms before and after shunt surgery. The disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid space hydrocephalus (DESH) and iNPH Radscale scores were used to evaluate the preoperative MR images. The primary endpoint was improvement in the mRS score a year after surgery, and the secondary endpoint was the iNPHGS after 1 year. The preoperative imaging features of the improved and non-improved groups were compared.

Results

The rates of the primary and secondary outcomes were 59.6% and 61.7%, respectively, 1 year after surgery. There were no significant differences in preoperative DESH score, iNPH Radscale, Evans' index (EI), or callosal angle (CA) between the improved and non-improved groups. Significant correlations were observed between the severity of gait disorder and EI and the CA.

Conclusions

The value of structural neuroimaging in predicting the prognosis of shunt surgery is limited, and screening for shunt surgery candidates should not rely only on preoperative imaging findings.

Key Points

- Early shunt surgery can significantly improve the clinical symptoms and prognosis of patients with idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH).

- Structural imaging findings have limited predictiveness for the prognosis of patients with iNPH after shunt surgery.

- Patients should not be selected for shunt surgery based on only structural imaging findings.

### Parkinsonian symptoms in normal pressure hydrocephalus: a population-based study [^115wZG5a]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

The reversibility of parkinsonian signs that has been reported after shunt surgery or CSF removal supports that these symptoms are caused by hydrocephalus and not just a result of comorbidity. A recent hospital-based study with 55 NPH patients who underwent a CSF tap test revealed a significant improvement of bradykinesia in upper and lower bodies, whereas tremor marginally improved and rigidity did not improve. In a recent publication, oral dopaminergic therapy added a positive effect to shunt surgery in the improvement of the UPDRS-m score in patients with NPH and parkinsonism, indicating that the disturbance in the dopaminergic system might not be totally reversible.

The findings in the present study highlight some of the diagnostic challenges when meeting a patient with parkinsonian features. However, there are some clinical hallmarks that can be useful. In contrast to PD, tremor at rest seems uncommon among individuals with NPH, and according to our results, asymmetric symptomatology is less common as well. In PD, non-motor symptoms such as olfactory dysfunction and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder are common and can precede the motor symptoms, and such symptoms would be valuable to study also in NPH patients to see if their presence could help in differentiating the disorders from each other. Neuropsychiatric symptoms as depression and anxiety are frequent in both conditions. When comparing the gait disturbance in PD and NPH, Stolze et al. found reduced velocity and stride length, freezing phenomenon, and reduced cadence in both groups; in addition, NPH patients had a broad-based gait, outwardly rotated feet, and a diminished step height. Nevertheless, we agree with Bugalho et al. that it might be difficult to differ PD from NPH only by gait function. Bradykinesia of the hand is showed to share the same features in NPH patients as in patients with PD, and even experienced neurologists might mistake these disorders. In addition, the disorders may co-occur. These circumstances illustrate the importance of a liberal use of radiological investigation when the PD symptoms are atypical or do not respond to dopaminergic treatment.

### Parkinsonian symptoms in normal pressure hydrocephalus: a population-based study [^1163JWvp]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Fig. 1
Flow chart of sample selection. Final study population, n = 168

To diagnose NPH, we used the guidelines by Mori et al. which are suitable for population-based studies, because they can be used without CSF pressure measurement. The criteria for "possible NPH" require at least two symptoms from the clinical triad; gait disturbance, cognitive impairment, and urinary symptoms. Ventricular dilation (Evans' index > 0.3) is mandatory. "Probable NPH" requires in addition to the criteria for "possible NPH", a CSF pressure of 200 mmH 2 O, or less. However, when CSF pressure measurements are not performed, as in the present study, the diagnosis "possible NPH with neuroradiological support" can be used instead. It requires an NPH-specific radiological picture of the brain with narrowing of the sulci and subarachnoid spaces over the high convexity/midline surface. Finally, the diagnosis "definitive NPH" is used when the symptoms improve after shunt surgery. To simplify, we denominated the groups as "unlikely", "possible", and "probable" NPH where the latter was equivalent to "possible NPH with neuroradiological support". The only two individuals with the diagnosis of "definite NPH", i.e. confirmed with shunt surgery were included in the "probable NPH" group.

### Acetazolamide trial in normal pressure hydrocephalus… [^111xNZJS]. ClinicalTrials (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Overview A pharmacological treatment to patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus is missing. The aim is to investigate if acetazolamide given to patients with NPH improves gait function and study the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to reduced symptoms. Patients will be randomized to acetazolamide or placebo and duration of treatment will be from diagnosis to the day of shunt surgery. Target dose is 500 mg/day. Study design is a double-blind randomized controlled trial and the plan is to include 42–50 patients. The study is investigator-initiated without financial sponsorship from the industry. Background: The only available treatment for normal pressure hydrocephalus is implantation of a neurosurgical shunt system that reduces symptoms in two out of three cases. Postoperative complications are common, causing reoperations in 20–30% within the first years after surgery. A pharmacological treatment is missing.

In three previous studies, acetazolamide, a reversible inhibitor of the carbonic anhydrase enzyme, was used as treatment off-label. In the first of these studies, 15 patients with NPH were treated with doses 250–500 mg/day and 10 patients improved. The second study was a case report of one patient with NPH who improved after receiving the dose 500 mg/day. The most recent study used doses of 125–375 mg/day and included 8 patients of whom 5 improved. Furthermore, the last study reported a reduction of the periventricular edema that is often present in the white matter close to the lateral ventricles in patients with NPH. These three studies were open label with no blinding or control group. Study design: Study design is a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial. The study is investigator-initiated without financial sponsorship from the industry. The plan is to consecutively include 42–50 patients with NPH.

Patients will be randomized to acetazolamide or placebo and take the study drug from diagnosis to admission for shunt surgery. Waiting time for shunt surgery at the center of the study is approximately 4–8 months at the moment. The dose will be titrated to 250 mg x 2 during 4–6 weeks. Two phone visits with a study nurse and routine blood samples are controlled during the titration phase to rule out side effects.
