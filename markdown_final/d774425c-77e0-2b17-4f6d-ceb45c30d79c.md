## Question

When yo start rybelsus

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to start Rybelsus (oral semaglutide). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-approved indication and whether the patient meets criteria. Then, I should verify the correct formulation and dose-escalation schedule. Next, I will review administration requirements that affect absorption. After that, I need to check contraindications, precautions, and drug interactions. Finally, I will consider special populations, switching scenarios, and monitoring, and then synthesize a concise, actionable answer with timelines and counseling points.

> Let me first confirm the indication and eligibility. Rybelsus is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and it is not indicated for type 1 diabetes or for weight management in the absence of T2D, so I need to ensure the patient has T2D and is 18 years or older before proceeding [^217eb6b4] [^46d08f04].

> Wait, let me verify the formulation and starting dose because there are two oral formulations. For formulation R1, the labeled starting dose is 3 mg once daily for 30 days; for formulation R2, the labeled starting dose is 1.5 mg once daily for 30 days, and in both cases the 3 mg or 1.5 mg dose is not intended for glycemic control but to improve tolerability during initiation, so I should confirm which tablet strength the patient actually has before advising the start [^9109882b] [^87b8ad26] [^38a8b771].

> I need to ensure the dose-escalation timeline is correct. After 30 days at the starting dose, escalate to 7 mg daily for R1 or 4 mg daily for R2; after another 30 days, if additional glycemic control is needed and tolerated, increase to 14 mg daily for R1 or 9 mg daily for R2, so the earliest maintenance dose is typically reached at day 61, assuming tolerability [^9109882b] [^87b8ad26] [^38a8b771].

> Hold on, I should verify administration requirements because absorption is formulation-specific and timing-sensitive. Take the tablet first thing in the morning with no more than 120 mL of water, wait at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking, or taking other oral medications, and swallow whole without splitting, crushing, or chewing; if a dose is missed, skip it and resume the next day — do not double up, and if multiple doses are missed, consider re-titration to mitigate GI symptoms, so I need to counsel on this strictly to avoid reduced bioavailability [^15636222] [^81617ee7].

> Next, I should review contraindications and key precautions. Do not start in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or MEN2; use caution and monitor for acute pancreatitis, acute kidney injury in the setting of severe GI reactions, gallbladder disease, and diabetic retinopathy progression; discuss the unknown human relevance of rodent C-cell tumors and counsel on symptoms of thyroid masses, and avoid coadministration with DPP-4 inhibitors or other GLP-1 RAs, so I need to screen for these before initiation [^83a4c043] [^f18f3234] [^4d39be3d].

> I will now examine special populations and drug interactions. No dose adjustment is needed for renal or hepatic impairment, but I should monitor renal function if there are severe GI adverse effects; semaglutide delays gastric emptying, which can affect absorption of other oral drugs, so separate timing and consider dose adjustments for insulin or sulfonylureas to reduce hypoglycemia risk, and I should double-check for interacting agents like levothyroxine where exposure may increase and require monitoring [^671011a2] [^0be5dfb8] [^4d39be3d].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on a GLP-1 RA and wants to switch to oral semaglutide. If switching from once-weekly semaglutide (Ozempic), wait one week after the last injection and then start Rybelsus at 7 mg daily for R1 or 4 mg daily for R2; if switching from another GLP-1 RA, start Rybelsus 7 days after the last dose and choose 3 mg or 7 mg based on prior tolerability and efficacy, so I should confirm the prior agent and timing before advising the start [^e7915d9b] [^07c4547f] [^notfound].

> Let me consider pregnancy and lactation. Discontinue Rybelsus at least 2 months before a planned pregnancy due to the long washout, and avoid breastfeeding because the absorption enhancer (SNAC) is present in human milk and infant exposure effects are unknown, so I need to ask about reproductive plans before starting [^671011a2] [^bbd7e102].

> I should confirm monitoring and follow-up. Check baseline labs including renal function, counsel on GI side effects and mitigation strategies, and monitor glucose more closely if combined with insulin or sulfonylureas; reassess at 30 days for dose escalation and again at 60 days for further titration, and consider earlier escalation only in select cases with excellent tolerability and urgent glycemic needs, documenting rationale and counseling on transient symptoms [^4d39be3d] [^36623619].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the patient has T2D, select the correct formulation, start at 3 mg daily for R1 or 1.5 mg daily for R2 for 30 days, escalate to 7 mg or 4 mg respectively for the next 30 days, and then to 14 mg or 9 mg if needed and tolerated, all while adhering to strict morning fasting administration and avoiding contraindications and interacting drugs; if switching from injectable semaglutide, wait one week and start at 7 mg or 4 mg depending on formulation, and if multiple doses are missed, consider re-titration to reduce GI symptoms [^9109882b] [^87b8ad26] [^38a8b771] [^e7915d9b] [^81617ee7].

Start Rybelsus when the patient has **type 2 diabetes** [^217eb6b4], is 18 years or older, and needs improved glycemic control despite diet and exercise [^217eb6b4]. Begin with **3 mg daily for 30 days** [^9109882b] to improve tolerability, then increase to 7 mg daily; if additional control is needed, increase to 14 mg daily after another 30 days [^87b8ad26]. Do not use for type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis [^217eb6b4]. Assess for contraindications (e.g. medullary thyroid carcinoma, MEN2) [^83a4c043] and counsel on GI side effects and administration requirements (take on an empty stomach with limited water, wait 30 minutes before eating or other medications) [^15636222] [^81617ee7]. Monitor for GI intolerance, hypoglycemia (especially with insulin or sulfonylureas) [^4d39be3d], and renal function if GI effects occur [^f18f3234].

## Indications for starting Rybelsus

Rybelsus is indicated for adults with **type 2 diabetes mellitus** [^217eb6b4] to improve glycemic control as an adjunct to diet and exercise [^notfound]. It is **not indicated** for type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis [^217eb6b4].

---

## Patient selection criteria

Before starting Rybelsus, assess the following:

- **Age**: ≥ 18 years [^notfound].
- **Diabetes type**: Type 2 diabetes mellitus [^217eb6b4].
- **Glycemic control**: Inadequate control despite diet and exercise [^notfound].
- **Comorbidities**: Consider cardiovascular disease, renal impairment, and gastrointestinal disorders [^f18f3234] [^671011a2].
- **Contraindications**: Personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or MEN2 [^83a4c043]; hypersensitivity to semaglutide or excipients [^55184ee0].

---

## Recommended starting dose and titration schedule

The recommended starting dose and titration are designed to **minimize gastrointestinal adverse effects** [^9109882b]:

| **Phase** | **Dose** | **Duration** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Initiation | 3 mg once daily | Days 1–30 | Improve tolerability; not for glycemic control |
| Escalation | 7 mg once daily | Days 31–60 | Glycemic control |
| Maintenance | 14 mg once daily | Day 61 onward | Additional glycemic control if needed |

---

If additional control is needed, increase to **14 mg daily** after at least 30 days at 7 mg [^9109882b].

---

## Administration instructions

Proper administration is critical for absorption and efficacy. Take the tablet **first thing in the morning** with no more than 120 mL of water, wait at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking, or taking other oral medications, and swallow whole — do not split, crush, or chew [^15636222] [^81617ee7].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring is essential to assess efficacy and safety. Track **glycemic control** with HbA1c and fasting glucose, monitor for gastrointestinal adverse effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain) [^f18f3234], and assess hypoglycemia risk — especially when combined with insulin or sulfonylureas [^4d39be3d]. Check renal function if significant gastrointestinal adverse effects occur [^f18f3234].

---

## Special considerations

- **Renal impairment**: No dose adjustment required, but monitor renal function if gastrointestinal adverse effects occur [^671011a2].
- **Hepatic impairment**: No dose adjustment required [^671011a2].
- **Elderly patients**: No specific dose adjustment, but monitor closely for adverse effects [^671011a2].
- **Pregnancy**: Contraindicated; discontinue at least 2 months before planned pregnancy [^671011a2].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting initiation

The PIONEER program demonstrated significant improvements in **glycemic control** and **weight reduction** with oral semaglutide compared to placebo and active comparators [^5d0116ac]. PIONEER 6 showed non-inferiority for major adverse cardiovascular events, supporting use in patients with high cardiovascular risk [^c2fcd7bb] [^1e74f571].

---

## When to consider alternative therapies

Consider alternatives if the patient has:

- **Type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis** [^217eb6b4].
- **Severe gastrointestinal disorders** (e.g. gastroparesis) [^4d39be3d].
- **History of medullary thyroid carcinoma or MEN2** [^83a4c043].
- **Persistent severe gastrointestinal intolerance** despite dose adjustment [^notfound].

---

Start Rybelsus in adults with **type 2 diabetes** who need improved glycemic control, beginning at 3 mg daily for 30 days, then titrating to 7 mg and optionally to 14 mg if needed. Ensure proper administration, monitor for adverse effects, and adjust therapy based on response and tolerability [^9109882b].

6.2 Key clinical considerations for using once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg in clinical practice

Currently, once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg is approved for use in Canada, Europe, the UK and the USA as an adjunct to a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in adults with an initial BMI of ≥ 30 or ≥ 27 kg/m 2 in the presence of ≥ 1 weight‐related comorbid condition.,

Figure 1 illustrates key considerations for the use of once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg in clinical practice. Semaglutide should be initiated at a dose of 0.25 mg once weekly and then escalated every 4 weeks according to the dose‐escalation schedule in Figure 1, until the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly is reached. This escalation schedule is designed to minimize GI AEs, but if a patient does not tolerate a dose during the escalation period, the subsequent escalation step can be delayed for a further 4 weeks, after which it should be re‐escalated to 2.4 mg. If needed, this re‐escalation step can be postponed (e.g. for 4 more weeks) and the escalation can be stopped at a lower maintenance dose where AEs are tolerable. In patients with type 2 diabetes, blood glucose should be monitored prior to starting and during treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg.

FIGURE 1
Key considerations for using once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg in clinical practice (approved in Canada, Europe, the UK and the USA). Abbreviations: AE, adverse event; GI, gastrointestinal; GLP‐1RA, glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist

The STEP trials excluded participants with renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 15 ml/min/1.73 m 2; except STEP 2, < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 or < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 with SGLT2i). However, the prescribing information states that no dose adjustment of semaglutide is recommended for patients with renal impairment.

There is limited evidence from trials and real‐world studies on strategies for managing GI side effects of GLP‐1RA treatment. Expert recommendations based on clinical experience centre around education and explanation, escalation to an appropriate dose and effective management. Patients should be counselled about the possibility of GI side effects and advised that they are typically transient and mild‐to‐moderate in severity. For mild and short‐term GI side effects, this should include providing advice on dietary modifications and recommending that patients increase their fibre and water intake for constipation and consider stool softeners. For more persistent or severe GI symptoms, pausing of dose escalation is recommended, and short‐term use of over‐the‐counter medications may be considered.

The lack of clinical trial data on switching between liraglutide 3.0 mg and semaglutide 2.4 mg in individuals with overweight or obesity precludes the development of formal evidence‐based recommendations. However, in the context of the use of GLP‐1RAs in patients with type 2 diabetes, recommendations include patient counselling, starting with the recommended dose titration (considering history of GI events with the previous GLP‐1RA), management of GI side effects and re‐evaluation of response.

Semaglutide 2.4 mg has shown clinically meaningful bodyweight reductions in obesity both in the primarily white population of the STEP 1‐5 and 8 trials, as well as in the east Asian participants of the STEP 6 trial. Furthermore, post hoc analyses from STEP 2 indicate that the response to semaglutide 2.4 mg was not influenced by race or ethnicity. However, a regional Phase IIIa trial in Brazil, China, Hong Kong and South Korea is ongoing and will further add to our knowledge on ethnicity as a potential clinical consideration.

Suggested Strategies for Optimal Oral Semaglutide Administration

Ensuring that patients who start oral semaglutide therapy receive comprehensive education from their healthcare provider is crucial. This education should encompass various aspects such as instructions on timing and method of administration, expectations regarding efficacy and adverse events, preventive measures to minimize the occurrence of side effects and on how to address them promptly. Thus, thorough patient education not only enhances treatment adherence but also promotes proactive management of potential challenges, ultimately promoting better overall outcomes.

The different aspects, suggested by the experts, to consider in subjects starting therapy with oral semaglutide were the following:
Patient communication Adopt specific and proactive counseling as a key component in the management of patients with T2D initiating oral semaglutide treatment. Recommend and explain the dose escalation strategy, with a starting dose of 3 mg once daily for at least 1 month, which can be then increased to 7 mg. After at least 1 month the dose can be increased to a maintenance dose of 14 mg once daily if needed to further improve glycemic control and body weight. Staying longer than 1 month on the 7-mg dose may help diluting GI side effects, but should not delay the achievement of individual targets. Inform patients about the potential occurrence of GI side effects in the initial weeks of oral semaglutide treatment, particularly during dose escalation periods. Patients should be reassured that in most cases, GI symptoms are mild to moderate and typically resolve naturally over time, encouraging them to persist on treatment.
Method and timing of administration Communicate the specific instructions related to mode of administration and their importance to patients initiating oral semaglutide treatment, to guarantee an effective drug bioavailability. Underline the necessity for a pre-dose fasting condition (enough to have an empty stomach) and observing an additional fasting period of at least 30 min post-dose, along with avoiding pharmacological interactions to allow correct semaglutide absorption. Recommend taking the medication in a time slot based on patient daily routine, when the stomach is empty. Address the patient's lifestyle and needs, to evaluate whether taking oral semaglutide after the overnight fast is the most suitable option or whether an alternative dosing time could be considered. In the latter case, provide the patients with clear written dosing instructions, regarding pre- and post-dose fasting.
Dose escalation schedule Extend the escalation periods beyond the recommended duration, if tolerability concerns arise at lower doses, i.e. maintain longer than 1 month on 7 mg before increasing the dose to 14 mg. Reduce the dose temporarily if adverse events persist and resume dose escalation once the symptoms diminish or resolve.
Presence of diseases or conditions affecting adherence and prescription of therapy. Emphasize adherence to specific administration timing recommendations, such as taking oral semaglutide before any other oral medications and waiting for at least 30 min before other oral medications.
Adherence to recommended eating behaviors for patients with T2D (details reported in Table 1).

### Insights into the early use of oral semaglutide in routine clinical practice: the IGNITE study [^be782b74]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Oral semaglutide (Rybelsus; Novo Nordisk) is the first glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist (GLP‐1 RA) developed for oral administration for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D), and it has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administrationand the European Medicines Agency. The efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide were assessed in the Peptide InnOvatioN for Early diabEtes tReatment (PIONEER) programme of 10 phase 3a randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which included more than 9500 patients. This programme studied the incorporation of oral semaglutide at multiple stages of the T2D treatment pathway: early therapy, add‐on to oral therapy and addition to insulin. Oral semaglutide showed significant improvements in glycaemic control and weight reduction versus various comparator arms representing common treatment classes in T2D, is based on a molecule with a favourable cardiovascular (CV) risk‐benefit profile, and was shown to be non‐inferior to placebo in terms of CV safety in the PIONEER 6 trial. The US prescribing information for oral semaglutide specifies initiation with a 3 mg starting dose for 30 days, followed by escalation to the 7 mg treatment dose, with further escalation to 14 mg after another 30 days if needed for additional glycaemic control.

Insights into the real‐world use of oral semaglutide are needed to further understand and support clinical decision‐making. The current study, InvestiGating New InitiaTors on oral semaglutidE in routine clinical practice (IGNITE), was designed to examine how trial data have been translated to US clinical practice during the early period of oral semaglutide availability, using electronic health record (EHR) data. We sought to evaluate the first patterns of routine clinical use of oral semaglutide, and to assess patients' clinical characteristics and glycaemic control.

### Evaluation of an oral small-molecule glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, lotiglipron, for type 2 diabetes and obesity: a dose-ranging, phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled study [^285e56b3]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 Study design

This was a phase 2, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, dose‐ranging, parallel‐group study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lotiglipron in adult participants with T2D and, separately, with obesity without T2D.

The study had 13 arms, with administration of oral lotiglipron (five arms) or matching placebo (one arm) in each cohort, and one additional arm in the T2D cohort receiving open‐label oral semaglutide (Rybelsus) as an internal reference standard (Figure 1). Participants in the T2D cohort were randomly assigned in equal numbers to receive lotiglipron QD at one of five maintenance doses (20, 40, 80, 160 or 260 mg) or matching placebo, or semaglutide QD at one maintenance dose (14 mg). Participants in the obesity cohort were randomly assigned in equal numbers to receive lotiglipron QD at one of four maintenance doses, with two dose titration regimens for the 200‐mg dose (80 mg, 140 mg, 200 mg five‐step titration, 200 mg four‐step titration and 260 mg) or matching placebo (Figure 1). The target doses and titration scheme selected for this study were based on observed safety, tolerability, PK and pharmacodynamic data in completed phase 1 clinical studies. The starting lotiglipron dose of 20 mg was found to be well tolerated in a phase I study. The target doses evaluated in this study (from 20 to 260 mg QD) were selected to allow adequate bracketing of efficacious doses (from low doses predicted to have sub‐maximal efficacy up to doses expected to have near‐maximal efficacy, while still having an acceptable safety/tolerability profile). The titration scheme aimed to gradually progress from the starting dose to the target dose in each arm while ensuring participants stay at each dose step for 4 weeks before titrating to the next dose level based on data from marketed GLP‐1R agonists, including oral semaglutide, where 4‐week intervals at each dose step are generally appropriate to facilitate mitigation of MoA‐driven GI adverse events. In addition, the employed titration scheme aimed for ≤ 2‐fold increase in PK exposure with consecutive titration steps.

Metabolism: The primary route of elimination for semaglutide is metabolism following proteolytic cleavage of the peptide backbone and sequential beta-oxidation of the fatty acid side chain.

Excretion: The primary excretion routes of semaglutide-related material are via the urine and feces. Approximately 3% of the absorbed dose is excreted in the urine as intact semaglutide.

Specific Populations

No clinically significant differences in semaglutide pharmacokinetics were observed based on age (≥ 18 years old), sex, race (White, Asian or Black or African American), ethnicity, body weight (40 to 188 kg), upper GI disease (i.e., chronic gastritis and/or gastroesophageal reflux disease), hepatic impairment (i.e., mild, moderate, severe based on the Child-Pugh system) and renal impairment (i.e., mild, moderate, severe, end staged renal disease).

Drug Interaction Studies

Clinical Studies and Model-Informed Approaches: The delay of gastric emptying with semaglutide may influence the absorption of concomitantly administered oral drugs. Trials were conducted to study the potential effect of semaglutide on the absorption of oral drugs taken with semaglutide administered orally at steady-state exposure.

Levothyroxine: Total thyroxine (i.e., adjusted for endogenous levels) AUC of was increased by 33% following administration of a single dose of levothyroxine 600 mcg concomitantly administered with oral semaglutide. Maximum exposure (Cmax) was unchanged.
Other Drugs: No clinically significant differences in semaglutide pharmacokinetics were observed when used concomitantly with omeprazole. No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs were observed when used concomitantly with semaglutide: lisinopril, S-warfarin, R-warfarin, metformin, digoxin, ethinyl estradiol, levonorgestrel, furosemide or rosuvastatin.

In Vitro Studies: Semaglutide has very low potential to inhibit or induce CYP enzymes, and to inhibit drug transporters.

Type 2 diabetes cardiovascular risk reduction — initiation and titration of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) should follow trial-tested dosing. SGLT2 inhibitors with CV benefit should be initiated at the lowest dose tested in CV and renal outcomes trials (e.g., 100 mg for canagliflozin, 10 mg for dapagliflozin, 10 mg for empagliflozin), and no further dose titration is needed for CV or renal risk reduction. Among GLP-1RAs, dulaglutide, liraglutide, or injectable semaglutide have demonstrated CV benefit to reduce the risk of MACE, and a GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit should be initiated at the lowest dose and up-titrated stepwise to the doses used in the trials or the otherwise maximal tolerated dose. Prior to initiating T2D therapies aimed at CV disease risk reduction, a detailed patient-clinician risk discussion is recommended, including risks, benefits, drug-drug interactions, safety, patient preferences, and cost considerations.

### Obesity pharmacotherapy in older adults: a narrative review of evidence [^2cb3372c]. International Journal of Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Weight loss trials

Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity (STEP) studies had no upper limit in age. STEP-1 took 1961 adults with a BMI ≥ 30 (or ≥ 27 in people with ≥ 1 weight-related coexisting condition) without T2D and demonstrated mean weight reduction of 14.8% in participants taking semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly (vs. 2.4% in the placebo group), as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention. 86.4% (vs. 31.5%) of patients achieved weight loss ≥ 5%, 69.1% (vs. 12%) achieved weight loss ≥ 10% and 50.5% (vs. 4.9%) achieved weight loss ≥ 15%. Results were reduced in those with T2D, but still significant (STEP-2). Further STEP trials have demonstrated mean weight reduction of 16% (vs. 5.7%) when semaglutide was used as an adjunct to intensive behavioural therapy (STEP-3), and improved head-to-head weight reduction compared to liraglutide over 68 weeks, with possible benefits in older adults given the once weekly administration of semaglutide (STEP-8). STEP-4 gave every participant a 20-week course of semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly, and produced a mean weight loss of 10.6%, before randomisation to either continued semaglutide treatment or exchange to placebo for an additional 48 weeks. Continuation of semaglutide resulted in a further 7.9% reduction in body weight from their week 20 weight, whereas the placebo group regained 6.9%. However, STEP 1 extension concluded that 1-year withdrawal of semaglutide results in regain of two-thirds of prior weight loss, highlighting that withdrawal of semaglutide results in weight regain which may be problematic in older adults who are already using polypharmacy approaches for comorbid disease. Consideration of a cyclical delivery of semaglutide, and other AOMs, could be considered, where semaglutide is administered until a pre-determined body weight is achieved, at which point an interval period is commenced until a pre-determined percentage of weight is regained, before restarting treatment. In addition to being polypharmacologically beneficial, this method would appeal to organisations funding healthcare in the licensing of AOMs. More evidence is needed to clarify the ideal duration that an AOM should be given initially before the first interval, but longer compliance with anti-obesity agents from the outset does result in reduced weight regain following cessation. If this method was to be implemented, it would be imperative to remember the evidence to date suggests benefit only with chronic prescription of respective AOM, both in relation to weight and cardiometabolic disease.

### Semaglutide in obesity: unmet needs in men [^1f8e9cb7]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Finding the optimal dose titration scheme helps to reduce AEs, and improve tolerability and adherence. A phase 2 dose-finding study for semaglutide in which 65% of the study population were men reported that slow dose escalation of semaglutide using 4-week dose escalation steps starting from an initial dose of 0.25 mg/week ameliorated AEs without compromising efficacy. A trial that included only a male population, which had the aim to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single escalating doses of semaglutide, identified the maximum tolerated single dose (MTSD) to be 15 μg/kg body weight, which was worked out to be 1.2 mg in a male subject weighing 80 kg. There were no serious AEs and no subjects were withdrawn due to AEs.

Based on differences in exposure-response analysis between men and women, established MTSD and our clinical experience, we propose that a higher initial dose of semaglutide of 0.5 mg/week should be considered for men, especially those with BMI > 35 kg/m 2. In the event of good tolerability, a rapid titration scheme in general may then be used in men. Since the response on weight reduction in men seems to be delayed in comparison to that in women, we also advise to delay the efficacy assessment in men to later than 3 months after treatment initiation. It would be of specific clinical interest to design randomized controlled trails to address these issues.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The pharmacodynamic evaluations described below were in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who received once weekly subcutaneous injections of placebo or semaglutide injection over 12 weeks (semaglutide injection-treated patients were started on lower dosages and then titrated up to 1 mg once weekly). RYBELSUS is not approved for subcutaneous use.

Fasting and Postprandial Glucose

Semaglutide reduces fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, treatment with semaglutide injection 1 mg resulted in reductions in glucose in terms of absolute change from baseline and relative reduction compared to placebo of 29 mg/dL (22%) for fasting glucose, 74 mg/dL (36%) for 2-hour postprandial glucose and 30 mg/dL (22%) for mean 24 hour glucose concentration.

Insulin Secretion

Both first- and second-phase insulin secretion are increased in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with semaglutide compared with placebo.

Glucagon Secretion

Semaglutide lowers the fasting and postprandial glucagon concentrations.

Glucose dependent insulin and glucagon secretion

Semaglutide lowers high blood glucose concentrations by stimulating insulin secretion and lowering glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner.

During induced hypoglycemia, semaglutide did not alter the counter regulatory responses of increased glucagon compared to placebo and did not impair the decrease of C-peptide in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Gastric emptying

Semaglutide causes a delay of early postprandial gastric emptying, thereby reducing the rate at which glucose appears in the circulation postprandially.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

The effect of subcutaneously administered semaglutide on cardiac repolarization was tested in a thorough QTc trial. At an average exposure level 4-fold higher than that of the maximum recommended dose of RYBELSUS, semaglutide does not prolong QTc intervals to any clinically relevant extent.

Persons on Once-Weekly GLP1RA

People who switch from once-weekly exenatide, dulaglutide, or semaglutide should start oral semaglutide 7 days after their last injection. Similar principles, as detailed above, apply to the choice of dose of initiation. A prescription of oral semaglutide that is started in response to lack of tolerability should begin with 3 mg daily. However, if oral semaglutide is chosen owing to lack of efficacy of current therapy, one may commence with 7 mg/day.

Once-weekly semaglutide has been compared with oral semaglutide, i.e. 0.5 mg once-weekly semaglutide with 7 mg of oral semaglutide. However, the difference in the impact on weight should be explained to the patient.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Discontinue RYBELSUS in women at least 2 months before a planned pregnancy due to the long washout period for semaglutide [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of RYBELSUS have not been established in pediatric patients.

8.5 Geriatric Use

In the pool of glycemic control trials, 1,229 (30%) RYBELSUS-treated patients were 65 years of age and over and 199 (5%) RYBELSUS-treated patients were 75 years of age and over [see Clinical Studies (14)]. In PIONEER 6, the cardiovascular outcomes trial, 891 (56%) RYBELSUS-treated patients were 65 years of age and over and 200 (13%) RYBELSUS-treated patients were 75 years of age and over.

No overall differences in safety or effectiveness for RYBELSUS have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients.

8.6 Renal Impairment

The recommended dosage of RYBELSUS in patients with renal impairment is the same as those with normal renal function.

The safety and effectiveness of RYBELSUS was evaluated in a 26-week clinical study that included 324 patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. In patients with renal impairment including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), no clinically relevant change in semaglutide pharmacokinetics was observed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

The recommended dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is the same as those with normal hepatic function.

In a study in subjects with different degrees of hepatic impairment, no clinically relevant change in semaglutide pharmacokinetics was observed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Semaglutide 2.4 mg for the treatment of obesity: key elements of the STEP trials 1 to 5 [^26315fa5]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

There are several trials that demonstrate the promising effects of GLP‐1s in general and semaglutide in particular on WM in subpopulations of people with obesity. In the Satiety and Clinical Adiposity – Liraglutide Evidence in individuals with and without diabetes (SCALE) trial of 3,731 people without diabetes, WL was maintained at 56 weeks with liraglutide 3.0 mg versus placebo (−8.0% versus −2.6%, respectively; P < 0.001) (34). The SCALE trial of 846 people with T2D and obesity or overweight demonstrated a 6.0% (6.4‐kg) reduction of initial body weight with liraglutide 3.0 mg versus 1.8 mg and placebo (4.7% [5.0 kg] and 2.0% [2.2 kg], respectively) (35). The Semaglutide Unabated Sustainability in Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN) clinical development program, which included > 8,000 people with T2D, demonstrated that semaglutide at doses of 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg weekly offered WM benefits of 2.5 to 5.7 kg and 2.0 to 7.9 kg, respectively (36). Liraglutide and semaglutide are administered at different frequencies and doses, and over a 24‐hour period, they have distinct pharmacodynamic effects (37, 38). However, they are equally associated with transient, mild, or moderate gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (17, 39). Clinical experience shows that slowing the initial escalation of liraglutide and semaglutide helps mitigate these side effects; hence, we have designed the trials in the STEP program to have a slow titration of semaglutide over a 16‐week period.

Conclusion

AOMs are an important treatment option for people living with obesity who are unable to lose weight and maintain WL or for those who do not meet the eligibility criteria for bariatric surgery or who failed to maintain WL following bariatric surgery. The STEP clinical development program with the GLP‐1 analogue semaglutide provides rigorous assessment regarding the use of semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly to treat people with obesity, with an effort to gain a greater understanding of WL, WL maintenance, safety, and tolerability in adults with obesity as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention. We anticipate that these trials will demonstrate that semaglutide represents a new and effective medication that can be used to improve the health and quality of life for patients with obesity.

Each STEP trial included an initial dose escalation for semaglutide, with initiation at 0.25 mg once weekly for 4 weeks, increased at 4‐weekly intervals to 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, 1.7 mg and finally 2.4 mg at week 16. Participants unable to tolerate 2.4 mg (i.e. would otherwise discontinue treatment) were permitted to remain at lower maintenance doses, with at least one attempt to re‐escalate to 2.4 mg. Participants discontinuing treatment prematurely remained in each trial.

AE information, including onset and end date, was collected throughout each trial, using open‐ended, non‐leading verbal questions. Reported AEs were proactively followed up at each subsequent visit/contact. AEs were coded using the current version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (Version 22.1) and categorized based on severity and seriousness, using standard definitions (File S1). AE incidence was assessed as a supportive secondary safety endpoint in each trial.

TABLE 2
Key eligibility criteria for STEP trials

Adults are excluded from the trials if there is a self‐reported change in body weight of > 5 kg within 90 days before screening. For trials that excluded patients with T2D (STEP trails 1, 3, 4, and 5), adults are excluded if they have a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus or T2D mellitus, HbA 1c ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol), or previous treatment with glucose‐lowering agents or any AOM within the past 90 days before screening.

For all trials, treatment discontinuation can be decided by the investigator or participant. After discontinuation, participants are encouraged to continue to attend visits per the schedule and may be given the option to restart trial medication. Protocol‐specified discontinuation criteria include safety concerns from the investigator, calcitonin level ≥ 100 ng/L, suspicion of pancreatitis, pregnancy or intention to become pregnant, and participation in another clinical trial. Participants can withdraw consent at any point and are considered lost to follow‐up if they repeatedly fail to attend scheduled visits and cannot be contacted.

The protocols allow for dose reductions in case a participant does not tolerate the recommended target dose of 2.4 mg and may stay at the lower dose level of 1.7 mg once weekly, if needed. This is only allowed if the participant would otherwise discontinue trial treatment completely and if it is considered safe to continue trial treatment, per the investigator's discretion. It is recommended that the participant make at least one attempt to re‐escalate to the recommended target dose of 2.4 mg once weekly. Dose is recorded at selected visits throughout the trials.

Outcome measures

The primary and confirmatory secondary end points are described in Table 1. For all trials, the primary endpoints are percentage change from baseline at randomization (note that this was from week 20 in STEP 4) to end of treatment (EOT) in body weight and ≥ 5% WL from baseline after EOT (not applicable for the sustained WM trial [STEP 4]). Confirmatory secondary trial endpoints include the proportion of participants achieving a body weight reduction ≥ 10% or ≥ 15% from baseline to EOT (not applicable for the sustained WM trial [STEP 4]). Other confirmatory secondary endpoints for all the trials are change from baseline to EOT (or change from randomization [week 20] to EOT for the sustained WM trial [STEP 4]), in waist circumference (centimeters), systolic blood pressure (millimeters of mercury), and clinical outcome assessments.

14.3 Combination Therapy Use of RYBELSUS in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

Combination with Metformin

In a 26-week trial (NCT02863328), 822 adult patients with type 2 mellitus diabetes were randomized to RYBELSUS 14 mg once daily or empagliflozin 25 mg once daily, all in combination with metformin. Patients had a mean age of 58 years and 50% were men. The mean duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus was 7.4 years and the mean BMI was 33 kg/m2. Overall, 86% were White, 7% were Black or African American and 6% were Asian; 24% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.

Treatment with RYBELSUS 14 mg once daily for 26 weeks resulted in a statistically significant reduction in HbA1ccompared to empagliflozin 25 mg once daily (see Table 5).

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of semaglutide SC (also known as Ozempic, Rybelsus, Wegovy):
- **Acute pancreatitis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as semaglutide has been associated with an increased risk of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. Discontinue semaglutide if acute pancreatitis is suspected.
- **AKI**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as semaglutide has been associated with an increased risk of acute renal failure and worsening of chronic renal failure. Monitor renal function when initiating or up-titrating semaglutide in patients with severe adverse gastrointestinal reactions.
- **Anaphylaxis, angioedema**: use caution in patients with a history of anaphylaxis or angioedema with other GLP-1 receptor agonists.
- **Decreased blood glucose**: use caution in patients taking insulin or insulin secretagogues. Consider reducing the insulin or insulin secretagogue dose.
- **Exacerbation of diabetic retinopathy**: use caution in patients with diabetic retinopathy. Monitor patients for disease progression.
- **Gallstone disease**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as semaglutide has been associated with an increased risk of cholelithiasis and cholecystitis.
- **Suicidal ideation**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as suicidal behavior and ideation have been reported in clinical trials with other chronic weight management products. Monitor for new or worsening depression, suicidal thoughts/behavior, and/or changes in mood or behavior. Avoid using semaglutide in patients with a history of suicidal attempts or active suicidal ideation. Discontinue semaglutide if suicidal thoughts or behaviors occur.
- **Tachycardia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as semaglutide has been associated with increases in resting HR. Monitor HR at regular intervals. Discontinue semaglutide in case of sustained increase in resting HR.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) initiation and monitoring — patients starting a GLP-1RA with demonstrated cardiovascular (CV) benefit should, if hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is well controlled or there is a history of frequent hypoglycemia, "wean or stop sulfonylurea and consider reducing total daily insulin dose by ~20% when starting therapy", and should "more closely monitor glucose at home for the first 4 weeks of therapy", with consideration to "discontinuing any sulfonylurea or glinide" and, for insulin users, "modestly reducing total daily insulin dose (by up to 20%)". Clinicians should "Discontinue DPP-4 inhibitor before starting", mitigate nausea by recommending "small portion sizes for meals, start at the lowest dose, and up-titrate as tolerated toward the goal dose used in CV outcome trials", and "Advise patients to undergo appropriate, guideline-recommended eye examinations before starting therapy if not done within the last 12 months". The potential "risk of diabetic retinopathy complications (for dulaglutide or injectable semaglutide)" should be discussed, and therapy should be "Avoid[ed] in patients with diabetic gastroparesis or active gallbladder disease".

14.4 Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Cardiovascular Disease

PIONEER 6 (NCT02692716) was a multi-center, multi-national, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. In this trial, 3,183 adult patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were randomized to RYBELSUS 14 mg once daily or placebo for a median observation time of 16 months. The trial compared the risk of a Major Adverse Cardiovascular Event (MACE) between RYBELSUS 14 mg and placebo when these were added to and used concomitantly with standard of care treatments for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The primary endpoint, MACE, was the time to first occurrence of a three-part composite outcome which included cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke.

Patients eligible to enter the trial were 50 years of age or older and had established, stable, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, peripheral artery disease, chronic kidney disease or NYHA class II and III heart failure or were 60 years of age or older and had other specified risk factors for cardiovascular disease. In total, 1,797 patients (56.5%) had established cardiovascular disease without chronic kidney disease, 354 patients (11.1%) had chronic kidney disease only, and 544 patients (17.1%) had both cardiovascular disease and kidney disease; 488 patients (15.3%) had cardiovascular risk factors without established cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease. The mean age at baseline was 66 years and 68% were men. The mean duration of diabetes was 14.9 years and mean BMI was 32 kg/m2. Overall, 72% were White, 6% were Black or African American and 20% were Asian; 16% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Concomitant diseases of patients in this trial included, but were not limited to, heart failure (12%), history of ischemic stroke (8%) and history of a myocardial infarction (36%). In total, 99.7% of the patients completed the trial and the vital status was known at the end of the trial for 100%.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs; semaglutide and liraglutide) — titration, missed doses, and precautions are detailed as follows: To minimize risk of GI adverse effects, gradual dose titration is recommended for semaglutide and liraglutide. Semaglutide is started at 0.25 mg weekly for the first 4 weeks, followed by doses of 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, and 1.7 mg weekly every 4 weeks at each dose, until the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg is reached after 16 weeks; for liraglutide, it is recommended to start with 0.6 mg daily for the first 7 days, followed by doses of 1.2 mg, 1.8 mg, and 2.4 mg daily every 7 days at each dose until the maintenance dose of 3.0 mg is reached after 4 weeks. If more than 2 consecutive doses are missed, clinical judgement is required to decide on subsequent dosing, and restarting the titration schedule should be considered if 3 or more consecutive doses are missed. Liraglutide or semaglutide should not be used with other GLP-1 RAs or with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors; caution is advised when using GLP-1 RAs in combination with insulin or sulfonylureas, with dose adjustment and monitoring for hypoglycemia. Because GLP-1 RAs can delay gastric emptying, it may impact the absorption of some medications that require rapid onset of action, and GLP-1 RAs have been associated with thyroid C-cell tumors in rodents in dose- and treatment duration-dependent fashion.

### Once-weekly semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity [^3d584436]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

The study STEP 1 was published by John P H Wilding and colleagues in 2021 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Obesity. In the STEP 1 study, the trial question was: what is the role of once weekly semaglutide as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention in adults with overweight or obesity? In the STEP 1 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the STEP 1 study, the population was: 1961 patients (1453 female, 508 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with a BMI of ≥ 30 (or ≥ 27 with ≥ 1 weight-related coexisting condition) who did not have diabetes. The key exclusion criteria were HbA1c ≥ 6.5%, self-reported change in body weight > 5 kg (11 lbs) within 90 days before screening, previous treatment with glucose-lowering agents or any antiobesity medications within the past 90 days before screening. In the STEP 1 study, the interventions were: n = 1306 semaglutide (initiated at 0.25 mg SC once weekly for the first 4 weeks and titrated every 4 weeks to the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly by week 16, plus diet and physical activity counseling) n = 655 placebo (matching placebo once weekly plus diet and physical activity counseling). In the STEP 1 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in relative weight reduction at week 68 (14.9% vs. 2.4%; AD 12.4%, 95% CI 11.5 to 13.4). In the STEP 1 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 10% at week 68 (69.1% vs. 12%; OR 14.7, 95% CI 11.1 to 19.4) Significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a reduction in weight by ≥ 15% at week 68 (50.5% vs. 4.9%; OR 19.3, 95% CI 12.9 to 28.8) Significant increase in absolute weight reduction from baseline to week 68 (15.3 kg vs. 2.6 kg; AD 12.7 kg, 95% CI 11.7 to 13.7). In the STEP 1 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in overall adverse events. significant differences in serious adverse events (9.8% vs. 6.4%), gastrointestinal disorders (74.2% vs. 47.9%), treatment discontinuation due to gastrointestinal events (4.5% vs. 0.8%). In the STEP 1 study, the conclusion was: in patients with a BMI of ≥ 30 (or ≥ 27 with ≥ 1 weight-related coexisting condition) who did not have diabetes, semaglutide was superior to placebo with respect to relative weight reduction at week 68.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide and the effect of switching from sitagliptin to oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes: a 52-week, randomized, open-label extension of the PIONEER 7 trial [^83330f4b]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

The switch part of the extension investigated the effect of switching from sitagliptin to oral semaglutide with flexible dose adjustment in a population with relatively well-controlled T2D. In the extension, after switching, an initial slight increase in HbA 1c was observed due to the withdrawal of sitagliptin and the gradual dose-escalation regimen for oral semaglutide, with patients initiating oral semaglutide at 3 mg (the lowest approved starting dose for the dose-escalation strategy). HbA 1c decreased once patients could be escalated to oral semaglutide 7 and 14 mg (ie, at weeks 60 and 68), stabilizing at week 76. By week 104, there were small reductions in HbA 1c with oral semaglutide (–0.2%) compared with a small increase in the sitagliptin group (0.1%). Difference between treatments was not significant by the treatment policy estimand, although reached significance by the trial product estimand (on-treatment without use of rescue medication), which may reflect the greater use of rescue medication in the sitagliptin group (24% vs 9% of patients in the oral semaglutide group). The difference in HbA 1c, although not significant in terms of absolute changes for the treatment policy estimand, may still have had an impact on goal achievement due to the baseline HbA 1c levels when switching (mean HbA 1c of 7.4%). Patients switched to oral semaglutide were more likely to achieve HbA 1c targets of < 7.0% (< 53 mmol/mol) than patients who continued on sitagliptin.

### A model-based simulation of glycaemic control and body weight when switching from semaglutide to 3.0-and 4.5-mg doses of once-weekly dulaglutide [^d51bd3d6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aim

To evaluate HbA1c and body weight changes when semaglutide 0.5‐ or 1.0‐mg once‐weekly (QW) is switched to dulaglutide 3.0‐ or 4.5‐mg QW via exposure‐response modelling.

Methods

HbA1c and body weight time‐course models were developed and validated with data from the SUSTAIN 1 to 10 trials for semaglutide and the AWARD‐11 trial for dulaglutide. Simulations were conducted for HbA1c and body weight over 52 weeks. In the initial 26 weeks, semaglutide was initiated at 0.25‐mg and titrated to 0.5‐ or 1.0‐mg QW via 4‐weekly stepwise titration, followed by 26 weeks of dulaglutide initiated at 0.75‐ or 1.5‐mg QW and escalated to 3.0‐ or 4.5‐mg QW via 4‐weekly stepwise titration.

Results

At 26 weeks, model‐predicted mean changes from baseline in HbA1c and weight for semaglutide 0.5 mg were up to −1.55% and −3.44 kg, respectively. After switching to dulaglutide 3.0 mg, further reductions were 0.19% and 1.40 kg, respectively, at 52 weeks. Predicted mean HbA1c and weight changes for semaglutide 1.0 mg at 26 weeks were −1.84% and −4.96 kg, respectively; after switching to dulaglutide 4.5 mg, HbA1c was maintained with additional weight reduction of up to 0.57 kg at 52 weeks. Glycaemic control was preserved when switching from semaglutide 1.0 mg to dulaglutide 3.0 mg.

Conclusion

Switching from semaglutide 0.5 mg to dulaglutide 3.0 or 4.5 mg with dose escalation potentially yields additional HbA1c and weight reductions; switching from semaglutide 1.0 mg to dulaglutide 4.5 mg may enhance weight loss.

3.1 and weight outcomes after switching from semaglutide 0.5‐mgto dulaglutide 3.0‐mgvia stepwise

For patients initiated at semaglutide 0.25‐mg QW and titrated to 0.5‐mg QW 4 weeks later, model‐predicted mean changes from baseline in HbA1c and body weight after 26 weeks on semaglutide were −1.55% and −3.44 kg, respectively (Table 2, Figure 2). Following a switch to dulaglutide initiated at 0.75‐mg QW, then escalated to 1.5‐mg QW after 4 weeks and finally to 3.0‐mg QW after another 4 weeks, the predicted mean changes from baseline in HbA1c and body weight at week 52 were −1.70% and −4.76 kg, respectively (Table 2, Figure 2).

TABLE 2
Summary of model‐predicted mean changes from baseline in HbA1c and body weight at weeks 26 and 52 for each dosing scenario

When switching from semaglutide 0.5‐mg QW to dulaglutide 3.0‐mg QW, via the alternative dosing regimen where dulaglutide was initiated at 1.5‐mg QW, the week 52 mean changes from baseline in HbA1c and body weight showed additional improvements versus semaglutide 0.5‐mg QW. These improvements were comparable regardless of dulaglutide dosing being initiated at 0.75‐mg QW or 1.5‐mg QW (Table 2, Figure 2).

In general, model predictions indicated that switching from semaglutide 0.5 mg to dulaglutide 3.0 mg should not result in any loss of glycaemic control and may in fact have a small positive impact on both HbA1c and body weight reductions for patients with T2D.

3.2 and weight outcomes after switching from semaglutide 0.5‐mgto dulaglutide 4.5‐mgvia stepwise

For semaglutide 0.5‐mg QW patients who switched to dulaglutide after 26 weeks of treatment, where dulaglutide was dose‐escalated every 4 weeks to 4.5‐mg QW, the predicted mean changes in HbA1c and body weight at week 52 were −1.83% and −5.06 kg, respectively (Table 2, Figure 2), suggesting potential for greater improvement in glycaemic control and weight reduction compared with dulaglutide 3.0‐mg QW in the previous dosing scenario.

### Oral semaglutide: dosage in special situations [^36623619]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Need for Urgency in Glucose Control

The prescribing information for oral semaglutide mentions that dose escalation should be done after 1 month. This advice is aimed at minimizing gastrointestinal symptoms and maximizing patient comfort.

There may be situations, however, where patients need urgent glucose control, to resolve symptoms, comorbidities, or complications of diabetes. Others may be concerned about their glucose levels, and may ask for early control.

If such people demonstrate good gastrointestinal tolerance to the 3 mg or 7 mg dose of semaglutide, one may consider dose up-titration after 10 or 20 days of therapy. Patients must be counseled about the possibility of transient symptoms, and how to mitigate them.

### Insights into the early use of oral semaglutide in routine clinical practice: the IGNITE study [^4019cd8e]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

In total, 34% of patients had no prescription for the 3 mg starting dose. This could be attributable to switching from another GLP‐1 RA, which permits initiation at a higher dose, or to patients receiving oral semaglutide samples, which were not captured in this dataset. The latter possibility would cause underestimation of changes in HbA1c from baseline because initiation of oral semaglutide for these patients would be earlier than the recorded index date. It is also notable that HbA1c reductions were observed, even though 26.1% of this cohort did not have a dose escalation beyond the initial 3 mg dose, indicating that further improvements might be achieved with escalation to the highest recommended dose of 14 mg. This is supported by the results of the PIONEER 7 trial, a flexible dosing study comparing oral semaglutide with sitagliptin 100 mg. All patients initiated the 3 mg dose of oral semaglutide, with the potential for dose adjustment to 7 or 14 mg at subsequent eight‐weekly intervals, based on HbA1c and gastrointestinal tolerability. Overall, 59% of patients on oral semaglutide at week 52 were receiving the 14 mg dose, 30% were receiving 7 mg and only 9% were receiving 3 mg. Overall, mean HbA1c reduction in the oral semaglutide group at this time point was −1.3% (standard error [SE]: 0.1) for the treatment policy estimand and −1.4% (SE: 0.1) for the trial product estimand. Although it is not possible to gather comprehensive information on the rationale underlying clinical decision‐making in a retrospective study, the fact that some patients in the current study received prescriptions only for the 3 mg initial dose may indicate an opportunity for education on dose escalation in the clinical care setting. Finally, the higher HbA1c reductions observed for patients with higher baseline HbA1c levels are consistent with data from the PIONEER programme highlighting the glycaemic benefit of oral semaglutide against comparators, across the full range of baseline HbA1c.

### Efficacy, safety and cardiovascular outcomes of once-daily oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes: the PIONEER programme [^5d0116ac]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

In a Phase II dose‐finding trial, oral semaglutide at doses of 2.5‐40 mg once daily demonstrated significant dose‐dependent reductions in glucose and body weight in patients with early T2D. 34 Oral semaglutide was well tolerated, and the main adverse events were GI‐related, which (in common with other GLP‐1RAs) mainly consisted of dose‐dependent, mild‐to‐moderate and transient nausea when initiating or titrating therapy. Fewer GI events were reported when patients started on a lower dose, suggesting that a gradual escalation could be a helpful mitigation strategy. 34 Based on the results of the Phase II trial, 34 oral semaglutide doses of 3, 7 and 14 mg were taken forward to the Phase 3 Peptide InnOvatioN for the Early diabEtes tReatment (PIONEER) programme, a series of 10 multicentre, randomized clinical trials.

Absorption

Semaglutide is co-formulated with salcaprozate sodium which facilitates the absorption of semaglutide after oral RYBELSUS administration. The absorption of semaglutide predominantly occurs in the stomach.

Semaglutide estimated absolute bioavailability was approximately:

0.4 to 1% after oral administration of 3 mg, 7 mg and 14 mg of RYBELSUS (formulation R1).
1 to 2% after oral administration of 1.5 mg, 4 mg and 9 mg of RYBELSUS (formulation R2).

Semaglutide maximum concentration was reached approximately 1-hour after oral RYBELSUS administration.

Effect of RYBELSUS Formulation: There were no clinically significant differences observed in the mean steady state AUC0-24h, SSand Cmax, SSbetween the 3 mg, 7 mg and 14 mg doses of RYBELSUS (formulation R1) and the 1.5 mg, 4 mg and 9 mg doses of RYBELSUS (formulation R2), respectively, in a clinical study conducted in healthy subjects.

2.4 Recommendations Regarding Missed Dose

If one dose is missed and the next scheduled dose is more than 2 days away (48 hours), administer WEGOVY as soon as possible. If one dose is missed and the next scheduled dose is less than 2 days away (48 hours), do not administer the dose. Resume dosing on the regularly scheduled day of the week.
If 2 or more consecutive doses are missed, resume dosing as scheduled or, if needed, reinitiate WEGOVY and follow the dose escalation schedule, which may reduce the occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms associated with reinitiation of treatment.

### Two-year effects of semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity: the STEP 5 trial [^0f9f2fa2]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In STEP 5, once-weekly treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg as an adjunct to behavioral intervention in adults with overweight (with at least one weight-related comorbidity) or obesity led to a substantial initial reduction in weight, which plateaued after approximately week 60 and was maintained for the remainder of the study. At week 104, participants in the semaglutide group had achieved a mean weight loss of 15.2% from baseline — a difference of 12.6 percentage points versus placebo plus behavioral intervention. This weight loss is comparable to the mean reduction of 14.9% (placebo-corrected weight loss of 12.4 percentage points) seen at week 68 in the STEP 1 trial of semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo (both plus behavioral intervention). Thus, our findings indicate that the substantial weight losses reported during 68 weeks' treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg in prior STEP trials, can be maintained with continued semaglutide treatment up to at least 104 weeks. The mean weight loss of ~15% achieved with semaglutide 2.4 mg at week 104 in STEP 5 exceeds weight loss reported at similar time points in trials with other pharmacotherapies for weight management in adults with overweight or obesity –.

Weight loss of ≥ 5%, a threshold widely used to indicate a clinically meaningful response to therapy, was achieved by > 75% of participants in the semaglutide group at week 104. Moreover, 61.8% of participants on semaglutide lost ≥ 10% of baseline weight, and over a third of participants had achieved at least 20% weight loss at week 104 in the semaglutide group. As was seen in prior studies, while the vast majority of participants receiving semaglutide 2.4 mg had lost weight at the end of the STEP 5 study, a small proportion of participants experienced weight gain. We do not know how weight would have changed in these participants had they not been receiving the drug; notably, the proportion of patients with weight gain during the study was substantially higher in the placebo group. There is marked variability in weight change in patients on weight management treatments; the reason for this is still unclear and likely involves complex biological and societal influences.

American Association of Clinical Endocrinology obesity consensus — semaglutide dosing and outcomes: subcutaneous (SC) semaglutide is "titrated monthly as tolerated up to a maximum dose of 2.4 mg weekly for treatment of obesity", and the oral form is "approved by the FDA for people with T2D at a dose of 14 mg per day" with phase III obesity doses of "25 mg and 50 mg per day". In STEP 1, semaglutide 2.4 mg produced "an average percent weight reduction of 16.9%… at 68 weeks of treatment", STEP 5 maintained "16.7%", and OASIS-1 oral 50 mg achieved "an average percent weight reduction of 17.1%" at 68 weeks. Higher-dose SC semaglutide "(7.2 mg/week)" is being tested; in SUSTAIN-FORTE, A1C fell "2.2%… with SC semaglutide 2.0 mg compared with 1.9% for 1.0 mg" in T2D. In SELECT among people "with established CVD with obesity and without T2D", semaglutide 2.4 mg SC resulted in "a 20% reduction in 3-point MACE".

Intervention

Patients will be assigned to two groups, with one receiving the active agent and the other receiving placebo. The active substance will be the oral GLP-1 receptor agonist semaglutide (Rybelsus 3 mg, 7 mg, 14 mg tablets; Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsvaerd, Denmark). The drug will have to be taken on an empty stomach in the morning after at least an 8 h fasting period. After the oral semaglutide tablet is ingested, the subjects will have to wait at least 30 min before eating, drinking or taking other oral medications. The oral semaglutide tablet must be taken with no more than a half glass of water (equivalent to 120 ml), must be swallowed whole and can not be split, crushed or chewed. The starting dose of oral semaglutide will be 3 mg; after 30 days, a dose escalation to 7 mg is anticipated; and after another 30 days, dose escalation to 14 mg, i.e. the maintenance dose, is expected. A dose escalation regimen is needed to avoid the development of the potential side effects (listed in Table 2). Dose escalation will be encouraged by notifying the patient by phone, with the call made 1 day prior to the day on which the new dose starts. If treatment with oral semaglutide is associated with unacceptable gastrointestinal side effects (moderate to severe), dose reduction or extension of dose escalation intervals will be allowed as judged by the unblinded nurse involved in the randomization process.

Table 2
Potential adverse effects of the oral semaglutide

The placebo and semaglutide tablets will be provided in identical cases, will be identically shaped and will be packed in identically shaped bottles that will be labelled with numbers. The patients will be advised to contact the study team in case of any problems or adverse events during the study.

Treatment Allocation

After the screening, the participants will be randomized to one of the two study groups in 1:1 ratio. A non-blinded study nurse (otherwise not associated with the trial) will allocate study participants into the groups evenly. Patients will be given a sufficient number of tablets (placebo or semaglutide) in bottles labelled by numbers, for the first 6 months of therapy. An additional drug package will be provided to each patient at the 6-month interval.

5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-Cell Tumors

In mice and rats, semaglutide caused a dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent increase in the incidence of thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and carcinomas) after lifetime exposure at clinically relevant plasma exposures [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. It is unknown whether RYBELSUS causes thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans as human relevance of semaglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined.

Cases of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide, another GLP-1 receptor agonist, have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and GLP-1 receptor agonist use in humans.

RYBELSUS is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of RYBELSUS and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness).

Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with RYBELSUS. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to the low-test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin value may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values > 50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated.

5.2 Acute Pancreatitis

Acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, including RYBELSUS [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

After initiation of RYBELSUS, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, discontinue RYBELSUS and initiate appropriate management.

Persons on Daily Injectable GLP1RA

Persons on daily injectable GLP1RA (exenatide, liraglutide, lixisenatide) who interchange to oral semaglutide may take their first dose the day after discontinuation of previous therapy. As mentioned by Evans et al. a detailed explanation of the method of drug administration must be shared with the patient. Oral semaglutide usage may be associated with gastrointestinal side effects, but these are usually mild and transient.

If this interchange is prompted by lack of tolerability, oral semaglutide should be initiated at 3 mg/day for 1 month, after which the dose can be up-titrated. If the shift is due to lack of efficacy of 10 µg twice daily (BD) exenatide, 20 µg once daily (OD) lixisenatide, or 1.2 mg once daily (OD) liraglutide, one may consider initiating oral semaglutide at 7 mg/day. While some experts propose a 14 mg/day starting dosage for persons on 1.8 mg liraglutide, we suggest a more cautious approach, to minimize potential side effects and ensure patient comfort. These suggestions are based only on expert opinion of the authors and previously published suggestions.

If the switch is requested for reasons of convenience, i.e. to avoid injectable therapy, a 3 mg oral semaglutide dose can be used to substitute for 5 µg BD exenatide, 10 µg OD lixisenatide, or 0.6 mg OD liraglutide. Although the manufacturers do not provide equivalent doses of different GLP-1RAs, these have been proposed previously by other experts. People on a higher dose of these injectables can be directly transitioned to 7 mg oral semaglutide.

### A model-based simulation of glycaemic control and body weight when switching from semaglutide to 3.0-and 4.5-mg doses of once-weekly dulaglutide [^bebd0fa3]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

To summarize, model‐based evaluations suggest that switching from semaglutide 0.5‐mg QW to dulaglutide 3.0‐mg QW and from semaglutide 1.0‐mg QW to dulaglutide 4.5‐mg QWvia stepwise dose escalation, can potentially yield additional and comparable HbA1c reduction, respectively, with greater weight loss. The ability of robust exposure‐response time‐course models developed from and validated with actual observed clinical trial data to explore a myriad of clinical dosing scenarios draws on the flexibility of modelling and simulations as tools to answer questions on prescribing scenarios, which may otherwise have to be evaluated separately with clinical trials. The learnings drawn from this model‐based approach serve to provide guidance to prescribers should a patient need to switch from QW semaglutide to dulaglutide, also given at the same weekly dosing frequency. In this scenario, model predictions showed that glycaemic control and weight benefits should be preserved, if not enhanced. The simulation results should also augment the understanding for different dosing scenarios in order to minimize the risk of losing efficacy during the transition and manage expectations for treatment outcomes.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) initiation — monitoring and coadministration guidance is emphasized as follows: Patients initiating a GLP-1RA should be informed that transient nausea is a relatively common side effect, and nausea and vomiting can be minimized by starting with the lowest dose, up-titrating gradually according to the label recommendations, ceasing up titration when the nausea becomes uncomfortable, and eating smaller portions; a low-fat diet can also help. This nausea does not imply gastrointestinal pathology and is usually self-limited in patients treated with longer-acting GLP-1RAs. GLP-1RAs should be used with caution in patients who have had problems with clinically significant gastroparesis, and if treatment is suspended, reinitiation should again be at the lowest dose, with gradual up-titration to avoid recurrent nausea and vomiting. GLP-1RA should not be coadministered with DPP4 inhibitors given that both work through GLP-1 signaling and have not been studied for use together. An increased risk of diabetic retinopathy complications has been noted with semaglutide, predominantly in patients with a prior history of proliferative retinopathy; therefore, these patients should have regular eye examinations, as recommended by the current guidelines.

SGLT2 inhibitors (sodium-glucose cotransporter-2) versus GLP-1RAs (glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists) — administration and factors prompting an alternative class: Mode of administration differs, with SGLT2 inhibitors oral and GLP-1RAs subcutaneous. Considerations that may prompt use of an alternative class for SGLT2 inhibitors include severely reduced kidney function, history of prior amputation, severe peripheral arterial disease, active diabetic foot ulcers (caution with canagliflozin), recurrent genital candidiasis, diabetic ketoacidosis, fracture (caution with canagliflozin), and if the patient is considering pregnancy or breast feeding; for GLP-1RAs, considerations include persistent nausea despite appropriate dietary education and low doses, gastroparesis, active gallbladder disease, history of MEN2 or medullary thyroid cancer, history of proliferative retinopathy (caution with semaglutide or dulaglutide), and if the patient is considering pregnancy or breast feeding. Renal function notes specify that eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m² is a caution for glycemic efficacy, the FDA label for canagliflozin allows use to an eGFR of 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2 in DKD, and to use clinical judgement when initiating an SGLT2 inhibitor if an ACE inhibitor or ARB is being started or up-titrated and renal function is impaired.

### Suitability and usefulness of a flexible dosing timing of oral semaglutide to maximize benefit in clinical practice: an expert panel [^36e03f5e]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

From clinical trials and observational data, oral semaglutide has proven to be the most effective second-line oral therapy for the management of patients with type 2 diabetes. This review aims to describe the perspective of an Italian expert panel that addressed the potential challenges arising during the use of oral semaglutide in the free-living conditions of routine clinical care. A group of Italian experts discussed and generated insights into the use of oral semaglutide in clinical practice. Key topics included the effectiveness of oral semaglutide in clinical practice, the positioning of the agent to optimize the treatment benefits, the possibility to adopt flexibility in the administration schedule, critical issues encountered, the role of patient communication and information in the importance of dose escalation and management of adverse events. Available data on efficacy and effectiveness of oral semaglutide from randomized clinical trials and real-world studies were reported, along with factors that determine tolerability and persistence on treatment. The debate over a fixed versus a flexible dosing schedule was critically addressed, providing anecdotical clues from a small case series and a real-world database. Additionally, a set of recommendations for clinicians to consider when prescribing oral semaglutide and during the process of patient monitoring were provided.

### Semaglutide 2.4 mg for the treatment of obesity: key elements of the STEP trials 1 to 5 [^90eec8d2]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The obesity epidemic is a public health concern, warranting further research into pharmacological treatments for weight management (WM) as an adjunct to lifestyle interventions. The Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity (STEP) program aims to investigate the effect of semaglutide versus placebo on weight loss, safety, and tolerability in adults with obesity or overweight.

Methods

Across five phase 3 trials (NCT03548935, WM; NCT03552757, WM in type 2 diabetes; NCT03611582, WM with intensive behavioral therapy; NCT03548987, sustained WM; and NCT03693430, long-term WM), ~5,000 participants are being randomly assigned to receive semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly subcutaneously versus placebo. Results will be available in 2020/2021. For all trials, the primary end point is change from baseline to end of treatment in body weight.

Results

Participants have a mean age of 46.2 to 55.3 years, are mostly female (mean: 74.1%-81.0%), and have a mean BMI of 35.7 to 38.5 kg/m 2 and a mean waist circumference of 113.0 to 115.7 cm.

Conclusions

The STEP program evaluates the efficacy and safety of semaglutide 2.4 mg subcutaneously once weekly in a broad population. The trials will provide insights on WM in people with obesity with and without type 2 diabetes and on long-term follow-up.

### Insights into the early use of oral semaglutide in routine clinical practice: the IGNITE study [^4165dcff]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Oral semaglutide is the first oral glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and showed significant benefits in glycaemic control and weight reduction versus active comparators in the PIONEER phase 3a randomized controlled trial programme. In this retrospective study, we present early data on the use of oral semaglutide in clinical practice, from the US IBM Explorys electronic health record database. In 782 patients prescribed oral semaglutide, 54.5% were women, and the mean age (SD) was 57.8years (11.3); 66.0% of patients received their prescription from a primary care practitioner. Although prescribing information recommends increasing the dose to 7 mg after 30days, 37.0% of patients received a prescription only for the initial 3 mg dose. Mean body mass index was 36.2 kg/m 2 (7.6); mean HbA1c was 8.4% (1.8%). Mean HbA1c change from baseline to approximately 6 months after oral semaglutide initiation was -0.9% (95% CI: -1.1%; -0.6%), with greater reductions in patients with higher baseline HbA1c. These data indicate prevalent early adoption of oral semaglutide in primary care, show real-world improvements in glycaemic control, and identify potential treatment gaps.

### Oral semaglutide: dosage in special situations [^570c7490]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP1RAs) are well accepted for the management of type 2 diabetes. Their impact on weight and vascular tone contributes to cardiovascular safety and is a major benefit associated with this class of drugs. However, their acceptance has been suboptimal, perhaps owing to their injectable nature. Moreover, these drugs were not considered frontline choices by clinical practice guidelines until recently. This, along with the cost, gastrointestinal side effects, risk of pancreatitis, and relative novelty, has precluded their routine use. The availability of oral semaglutide has created new opportunities for the use of GLP1RA in a patient-friendly manner. Evans et al. share a pragmatic approach to the placement of oral semaglutide in clinical practice, and also describe practical tips regarding the posology of the drug. We add to this by highlighting certain other common situations that may require subtle changes in medication counseling. This is a commentary, based on the expert opinion of the authors, and is in accordance with the ethical guidelines for publishing any manuscript. It does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors.

3.3 trajectory

For patients with HbA1c measurements for at least three time points during baseline and follow‐up, mean HbA1c was 8.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.7%‐8.4%; n = 133) 6 months preindex, and 8.2% both at 3 months preindex (7.8%‐8.5%; n = 105) and at index date (7.9%‐8.5%; n = 145) (Figure 1A). Mean HbA1c was 7.6% (7.3%‐7.9%; n = 107) 3 months after oral semaglutide initiation and was 7.2% (6.9%‐7.6%) in the smaller group of patients with data 6 months after initiation (n = 66).

3.4 changes from baseline

In patients with eligible baseline and follow‐up measurements (n = 211; 27.0% of full cohort; see Table S2 for baseline characteristics), the mean HbA1c change from baseline to follow‐up (mean: 5.7 months) was −0.9% (95% CI: −1.1%; −0.6%; Figure 1B). Greater HbA1c reductions were observed in patients with HbA1c more than 7% at baseline (−1.1% [−1.4%; −0.8%]), in patients with HbA1c of 8% or higher (−1.4% [−1.8%; −1.1%]), and in patients with HbA1c of 9% or higher (−2.1% [−2.6%; −1.5%]). HbA1c reductions from baseline were also observed in GLP‐1 RA‐naïve patients (−1.0% [−1.3%; −0.7%]; n = 154), and in patients who had switched to oral semaglutide from another GLP‐1 RA (−0.6% [−1.0%; −0.2%]; n = 57).

Data Synthesis

Four phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind trials demonstrated efficacy of high-dose once-weekly semaglutide compared with placebo for weight loss. Study populations included patients with overweight or obesity (STEP 1, STEP 3, and STEP 4) or patients with diabetes and with overweight or obesity (STEP 2). Lifestyle interventions for diet and exercise were included for all participants. Weight loss from baseline was significant for all studies, and secondary outcomes demonstrated cardiometabolic improvements including waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and lipid profiles. Gastrointestinal adverse effects were common, but the medication was otherwise well tolerated.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

High-dose semaglutide offers significant weight-lowering potential and favorable effects on cardiometabolic risk factors and glycemic indices. Clinicians and patients should consider the route and frequency of administration, adverse effect profile, and cost when choosing an antiobesity medication. The importance of concomitant lifestyle interventions should be emphasized.

Conclusions

High-dose once-weekly semaglutide can significantly reduce weight, and although gastrointestinal adverse effects were common, it is generally well tolerated.

### Effect of once-weekly semaglutide versus thrice-daily insulin aspart, both as add-on to metformin and optimized insulin glargine treatment in participants with type 2 diabetes (SUSTAIN 11): a randomized, open-label, multinational, phase 3b trial [^52dc3d1a]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

2.3 Treatments and randomization

Participants underwent a 2‐week screening period, followed by 12‐week run‐in, 52‐week treatment and 5‐week follow‐up periods (Figure S1). At run‐in start, participants were transferred from their previous once‐ or twice‐daily BI injections to s.c. once‐daily IGlar (U100). Self‐measured plasma glucose (SMPG) profiles were used to optimize the IGlar dose during run‐in and throughout the trial. For further details on the titration algorithms, see the supporting information. Participants continued metformin treatment (1500‐3000 mg or maximum tolerated dose) throughout the trial unless related safety concerns arose; additional OADs were discontinued.

At run‐in end, participants with HbA1c of more than 7.5% to 10.0% or less (> 58 to ≤ 86 mmol/mol) were randomized 1:1 to receive OW semaglutide 1.0 mg or TID IAsp 100 U/ml injections from week 0 (randomization/baseline) to week 52 (end of treatment [EOT]). Participants randomized to OW semaglutide underwent dose escalation as per label. Semaglutide dose reduction from 1.0 to 0.5 mg was allowed for safety concerns or unacceptable intolerability.

Participants randomized to IAsp were initiated at 4 U TID. Dose adjustments of both IGlar and IAsp were based on SMPG measurements according to the titration guidelines (supporting information) and individualized treatment goals, at the investigator′s discretion. Persistent and/or unacceptable hyperglycaemia was initially managed with adjustment of insulin doses, followed by rescue medication, at the investigator′s discretion. Initiation of a sulphonylurea, incretin‐based therapy (GLP‐1RA or DPP‐4i) or prandial insulin was not permitted. For further details on treatments and randomization, see the supporting information.

Results

A total of 26 patients started treatment with semaglutide (15 females, median age at initiation of semaglutide was 52 (range 18–65) years). Median body weight at initial diagnosis of the hypothalamic tumor was 80 (range 50–140) kg (median BMI 25 (range 20–38) kg/m 2) which increased over a median period of 4 (range 0–31) years to 116 (range 76–175) kg (median BMI 38 (range 28–58) kg/m 2) before initiation of semaglutide (Table 1). Nine patients had previously been treated with liraglutide but was converted to semaglutide treatment once it became available in Denmark. The remaining 17 patients commenced treatment directly with semaglutide. After the up-titration phase, the median dose of semaglutide at the end of the observation period was median 1.6 (range 0.5–2.5) mg weekly.

Design of the pioneer trials

Based on a phase II clinical trial, a sequence of eight multicenter, randomized phase III clinical trials, the PIONEER program, assessed the efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide. Together, the trials evaluated oral semaglutide in 6163 patients who were at least 18 years old, had a diagnosis of T2D for at least 90 days before screening, and, for most patients, had inadequate glycemic control. These trials included patients at the beginning of treatment (PIONEER 1), patients with advanced disease (PIONEER 8), and special populations (PIONEER trials 5 and 6). Furthermore, the trials also evaluated oral semaglutide versus oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) (PIONEER trials 2 and 3) or the GLP-1 RA liraglutide (PIONEER 4) and oral semaglutide in flexible doses (PIONEER 7) (Table 1).

In all PIONEER trials, typical T2D patients received gradually increased doses of oral semaglutide as described earlier, except for PIONEER 7, in which the medication dose started at 3 mg and, after an 8-week interval, could be increased or decreased depending on the patient's glycemic response and gastrointestinal tolerability (flexible dose-adjustment approach).

Semaglutide pharmacology

Semaglutide is a long‐acting GLP‐1 analogue that mimics the effects of native GLP‐1, which promotes WL by reducing energy intake, increasing satiety and satiation, and reducing hunger, as well as enhancing glycemic control (17). Many GLP‐1s have been approved for the treatment of T2D, but only liraglutide 3.0 mg daily has been approved for WM. Semaglutide is approved for treatment of diabetes at the dosage of ≤ 1.0 mg once weekly subcutaneously or in oral tablet form at a dosage of up to 14 mg (2, 17, 18, 19, 20).

Current phase 3 trials are investigating semaglutide as a new GLP‐1 analogue for the treatment of obesity because greater WL was observed with semaglutide than liraglutide (21). In the phase 2 trial of semaglutide in adults with obesity, a 0.4‐mg dose daily was well tolerated, and patients experienced a mean WL at week 52 from baseline of −13.8% compared with −7.8% for liraglutide 3.0 mg and −2.3% for placebo (21).

Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity program

The Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity (STEP) clinical trial development program is evaluating semaglutide 2.4 mg, administered subcutaneously once weekly, for WM in people with obesity or overweight. The purpose of the program is to demonstrate the effect, safety, and tolerability profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg on WL, to enable further clinical development, and to support regulatory approval of semaglutide for WM. The trial design, objectives, end points, and baseline characteristics of five of the STEP trials are presented in this article.

### Oral semaglutide (Rybelsus) [^bbd7e102]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In an embryofetal development study in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys, subcutaneous doses of 0.015, 0.075 and 0.15 mg/kg twice weekly (1.9-, 9.9- and 29-fold the MRHD) were administered throughout organogenesis, from Gestation Day 16 to 50. Pharmacologically mediated, marked initial maternal body weight loss and reductions in body weight gain and food consumption coincided with the occurrence of sporadic abnormalities (vertebra, sternebra, ribs) at ≥ 0.075 mg/kg twice weekly (≥ 9X human exposure).

In a pre- and postnatal development study in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys, subcutaneous doses of 0.015, 0.075 and 0.15 mg/kg twice weekly (1.3-, 6.4- and 14-fold the MRHD) were administered from Gestation Day 16 to 140. Pharmacologically mediated marked initial maternal body weight loss and reductions in body weight gain and food consumption coincided with an increase in early pregnancy losses and led to delivery of slightly smaller offspring at ≥ 0.075 mg/kg twice weekly (≥ 6X human exposure).

Salcaprozate sodium (SNAC), an absorption enhancer in RYBELSUS, crosses the placenta and reaches fetal tissues in rats. In a pre- and postnatal development study in pregnant Sprague Dawley rats, SNAC was administered orally at 1,000 mg/kg/day (exposure levels were not measured) on Gestation Day 7 through lactation day 20. An increase in gestation length, an increase in the number of stillbirths and a decrease in pup viability were observed.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

A clinical lactation study reported semaglutide concentrations below the lower limit of quantification in human breast milk. However, salcaprozate sodium (SNAC) and/or its metabolites are present in human milk. Since the activity of enzymes involved in SNAC clearance may be lower in infants compared to adults, higher SNAC plasma levels may occur in neonates and infants. Because of the unknown potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed infant due to the possible accumulation of SNAC, and because there are alternative formulations of semaglutide that do not contain SNAC that can be used during lactation, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with RYBELSUS.
