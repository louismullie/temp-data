## Question

Spironolactone to cure bacterial vaginosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether spironolactone can cure bacterial vaginosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what spironolactone is actually indicated for and its mechanism of action. Then, I should verify what bacterial vaginosis is, how it's treated per guidelines, and whether spironolactone appears anywhere in those recommendations. Next, I will check for any mechanistic rationale or clinical trials supporting spironolactone in BV. After that, I should consider sources of confusion and potential safety or interaction issues. Finally, I will synthesize a clinical recommendation and note considerations for recurrent BV management with appropriate references.

> Let me first confirm spironolactone's role and pharmacology, because I need to ensure we're not conflating conditions. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic with antiandrogen activity and is used off-label for acne in adult women, with efficacy supported by randomized trial data and systematic reviews; it is not an antimicrobial agent and is not indicated for genitourinary infections or vaginal dysbiosis, to my knowledge [^111fnaQQ] [^116j549X] [^115c1F1P].

> Next, I should review what bacterial vaginosis actually is and how it behaves, since that will drive whether an antiandrogen could plausibly help. BV is a polymicrobial vaginal dysbiosis characterized by reduced Lactobacillus and overgrowth of anaerobes such as Gardnerella and Prevotella, often within a biofilm; it is treated as an infectious dysbiosis using antibiotics with anaerobic coverage, not with hormonal or antiandrogen therapies [^111aLKtC] [^116Dok4Y].

> Hold on, let me verify the guideline-backed treatments, because this is where spironolactone would appear if it had any role. Authoritative guidelines recommend metronidazole or clindamycin as first-line therapy, with other nitroimidazoles or secnidazole as alternatives, delivered orally or intravaginally; FDA labeling similarly supports these agents for BV, and I do not see spironolactone listed anywhere in these treatment algorithms [^116ecoQF] [^114kX2MY] [^114n4Gn7] [^114Rr35y] [^114M7v4Y].

> Wait, let me think about mechanism one more time, because sometimes a drug could have noncanonical effects. Spironolactone's antiandrogenic action decreases sebum production in acne and does not confer antibacterial activity against BV-associated organisms, nor does it have established antibiofilm or vaginal microbiome–restorative properties in BV, which argues against a plausible therapeutic mechanism for BV [^112fqYRd] [^113zCB82].

> I should double-check whether any trials or case series have evaluated spironolactone for BV, because absence from guidelines doesn't absolutely prove absence of evidence. Scanning across guideline summaries and BV therapeutic reviews, as well as the spironolactone acne literature, I find no randomized trials, observational studies, or case reports supporting spironolactone for BV, and it appears exclusively in acne-focused evidence syntheses, not BV studies [^116ecoQF] [^114kX2MY] [^111fnaQQ] [^116XzeZJ].

> Hmm, wait a minute, could this be a terminology mix-up. I should consider potential confusion between "bacterial vaginosis" and "acne vulgaris", especially since spironolactone is used for acne vulgaris in women of reproductive age and BV affects the same demographic; this co-location in clinical discussions may lead to conflation, but therapeutically they are unrelated entities with distinct pathophysiology and treatments [^111fnaQQ] [^116j549X] [^116ecoQF].

> Putting this together, I will now state the clinical bottom line while I keep checking that I'm consistent with the evidence. Spironolactone is not a treatment for bacterial vaginosis and has no evidence-based or guideline-supported role in BV care; standard antibiotic regimens with metronidazole or clindamycin, among others, should be used to treat BV according to CDC and WHO recommendations [^116ecoQF] [^114kX2MY] [^114n4Gn7].

> But wait, what if the patient is already taking spironolactone for acne and presents with BV. I should confirm the safety posture: there is no indication to stop spironolactone solely because BV is present, but spironolactone does not treat BV, so appropriate BV-directed antibiotics should be initiated per guidelines while acne therapy decisions remain guided by dermatologic indications and tolerability data from acne trials [^115c1F1P] [^1112mbNC] [^116ecoQF].

> I need to ensure I address recurrence, since BV often relapses and clinicians may look for non-antibiotic adjuncts. Recurrence within months is common and linked to biofilm persistence and partner-associated factors; evidence-based strategies include extended or suppressive antibiotic approaches and, in research contexts, partner-directed interventions or antibiofilm concepts, though the latter remain investigational and not a role for spironolactone [^116Ac4vJ] [^114h7Zfb] [^112fqYRd] [^113LgHuK].

> Hold on, I should verify that I haven't overlooked any niche indication or off-label report for spironolactone in BV; after reconsidering guideline tables and the BV therapeutic landscape, I still find no support for spironolactone in BV, reinforcing that using it for BV would risk delaying effective antibiotic therapy without any demonstrated benefit [^116ecoQF] [^114kX2MY] [^114n4Gn7].

> Final takeaway, after double-checking the key sources: spironolactone and bacterial vaginosis are therapeutically unrelated; treat BV with recommended antibiotics, continue or adjust spironolactone only for its intended dermatologic indications, and avoid substituting spironolactone for proven BV regimens [^116ecoQF] [^114kX2MY] [^111fnaQQ].

Spironolactone does not cure bacterial vaginosis (BV) because it has **no antibacterial activity** against BV-associated organisms. BV is treated with **antibiotics** such as metronidazole, clindamycin, or tinidazole, which are recommended by clinical guidelines [^116ecoQF] [^114kX2MY]. Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist used for conditions like hypertension, heart failure, and acne, and is **not indicated for BV** [^114n4Gn7] [^111fnaQQ]. Using spironolactone for BV is ineffective and may **delay appropriate care**.

---

## Mechanism of action of spironolactone

Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and aldosterone antagonist that **blocks mineralocorticoid receptors**, reducing sodium and water retention while increasing potassium retention. It is used for:

- Hypertension
- Heart failure
- Hyperaldosteronism
- Acne vulgaris (anti-androgenic effects)

Spironolactone has **no antibacterial or antimicrobial activity** and does not affect bacterial growth or biofilm formation.

---

## Pathophysiology of bacterial vaginosis

BV is characterized by a **shift from Lactobacillus-dominated flora to anaerobes** such as Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Prevotella spp., and Mobiluncus spp [^111aLKtC]. This dysbiosis results in:

- Increased vaginal pH
- Formation of bacterial biofilms [^112fqYRd]
- Persistent infection and high recurrence rates [^116Ac4vJ]

Effective BV treatment requires **antibiotics** that target these anaerobes and disrupt biofilms.

---

## Recommended treatments for bacterial vaginosis

Current clinical guidelines **recommend the following antibiotic regimens** for BV [^114fsSas] [^114n4Gn7]:

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage and duration** | **Route of administration** |
|-|-|-|
| Metronidazole | 500 mg twice daily for 7 days | Oral [^116ecoQF] |
| Metronidazole gel | 0.75% once daily for 5 days | Intravaginal [^116ecoQF] |
| Clindamycin cream | 2% once daily at bedtime for 7 days | Intravaginal [^116ecoQF] |
| Tinidazole | 2 g once daily for 2 days or 1 g once daily for 5 days | Oral [^114TLxrK] |
| Secnidazole | 2 g single dose | Oral [^117PdSop] |

---

These regimens **effectively eradicate BV-associated bacteria** and reduce recurrence.

---

## Clinical evidence regarding spironolactone and bacterial vaginosis

There is **no clinical evidence** or published studies supporting spironolactone for BV. Spironolactone is **not included in any clinical guidelines** or recommendations for BV management [^114fsSas] [^114kX2MY].

---

## Potential risks and side effects of spironolactone

Using spironolactone for BV **may cause adverse effects**, including:

- Hyperkalemia (elevated potassium levels)
- Menstrual irregularities
- Breast tenderness or gynecomastia
- Gastrointestinal disturbances
- Fatigue and dizziness

These risks outweigh **any hypothetical benefit**, given the lack of antibacterial activity.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Spironolactone **does not cure BV** and has **no antibacterial activity** against BV-associated organisms. BV should be treated with **recommended antibiotics** such as metronidazole, clindamycin, or tinidazole [^116ecoQF]. Using spironolactone for BV is ineffective and may **delay appropriate treatment**, thereby increasing the risk of recurrence and complications [^116Ac4vJ].

### Evidence on the benefits and harms of screening and treating pregnant women who are asymptomatic for bacterial vaginosis: An update review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^1122fQNN]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis is the most common lower genital tract syndrome among women of reproductive age. There has been continued debate about the value of screening and treating asymptomatic pregnant women for bacterial vaginosis.

- **Purpose**: To examine new evidence on the benefits and harms of screening and treating bacterial vaginosis in asymptomatic pregnant women.

- **Data sources**: English-language studies on Ovid MEDLINE (2000 to September 2007) and Cochrane Library databases (through September 2007), reference lists, and expert suggestions.

- **Study selection**: Screening, treatment, or adverse effect studies with pregnancy outcome data in women who are asymptomatic for bacterial vaginosis.

- **Data extraction**: Study and patient characteristics, treatment variables, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and internal validity quality criteria from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and Jadad scale were abstracted.

- **Data synthesis**: Seven new randomized, controlled treatment trials and 2001 report data were combined in a series of meta-analyses to estimate the pooled effect of treatment on preterm delivery (< 37, < 34, and < 32 weeks); low birthweight; and preterm, premature rupture of membranes.

- **Limitations**: No screening studies that compared a screened population with a nonscreened population were found. Significant heterogeneity was found among the high-risk treatment trials (P < 0.001). It is not clear from the detailed description of the studies which factors explain the differences in preterm delivery rates and potentially the association of treatment effect.

### Antibiotics for treating bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy [^116Dgvug]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis is an imbalance of the normal vaginal flora, characterized by an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria and a lack of the normal lactobacillary flora. Women may have symptoms of a characteristic vaginal discharge but are often asymptomatic. Bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy has been associated with poor perinatal outcomes, particularly preterm birth (PTB). Identification and treatment may reduce the risk of PTB and its consequences.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antibiotic treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 May 2012), searched cited references from retrieved articles, and reviewed abstracts, letters to the editor, and editorials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials comparing antibiotic treatment with placebo or no treatment or comparing two or more antibiotic regimens in pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis or intermediate vaginal flora, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic and detected through screening.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, trial quality, and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information.

- **Main results**: We included 21 trials of good quality, involving 7,847 women diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis or intermediate vaginal flora. Antibiotic therapy was shown to be effective at eradicating bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy (average risk ratio (RR) 0.42; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 0.56; 10 trials, 4,403 women; random-effects, T² = 0).

### Bacterial vaginosis: Drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^1165g122]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

What we can learn from past male-partner treatment trials:

More than 60 years ago, researchers and clinicians held the view that the syndrome of bacterial vaginosis (BV) was sexually transmitted, or at least, associated with sex. The findings from the six male-partner treatment trials conducted in the 1980s and 1990s have been extensively reviewed, but we briefly summarize the findings, with the aim of understanding the outcomes.

One of the challenges when assessing the effectiveness of partner treatment is that the trials utilized very different combinations of antibiotic treatments for differing durations, and there was no published data to inform what treatments may be optimal for men. These trials had major trial-related limitations including small sample sizes, absence of power calculations, inconsistent and non-standard methods to diagnose BV in women, use of single-dose and non-standard treatments for women (which we now know are suboptimal), lack of data on treatment adherence, and high attrition. Another key difference between the trials was that the clinical endpoints were measured anywhere from 7 to 10 days to 12 weeks post-randomization. The timing of the endpoint may be critical in determining if an intervention is efficacious. Among couples counseled to abstain from sex, BV endpoints measured immediately post-treatment are more likely to reflect the efficacy of female-only treatment rather than the effect of treating the male on BV. In contrast, endpoints measured following a longer period post-treatment may be undermined by the introduction of new variables.

### Antibiofilm agents for the treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis: A systematic narrative review [^1114nKdN]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

The ongoing search for new therapeutics against bacterial vaginosis (BV) has been complicated by an incomplete understanding of its pathophysiology and the role of biofilms. Numerous promising agents are being investigated, and findings indicate that the application of anti-BV biofilm agents may bring a potential breakthrough in the treatment of BV; however, this is still an evolving field predominantly in the preclinical stages of research. With concerns of antibiotic resistance, action is urgently needed to move the study of these diverse antibiofilm agents into animal and human trials, although the absence of optimal animal models for BV is slowing the momentum of this much-needed development.

### Antibiofilm agents for the treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis: A systematic narrative review [^1113DUBd]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

In recent years, the increased understanding of BV biofilms has stimulated research on how to improve the standard of care through the development of antibiofilm agents. Currently, a range of antibiofilm agents is being actively explored, including various antiseptics, cationic peptides, enzymes, plant extracts, probiotics, and surfactants that could assist in the penetration of the biofilm structure. However, there are no literature reviews summarizing the existing evidence from anti-BV biofilm research.

### Clindesse [^1151SPZz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Two clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of Clindesse for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. A clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis was defined by the presence of a homogeneous vaginal discharge that (a) has a pH of greater than 4.5, (b) emits a "fishy" amine odor when mixed with a 10% KOH solution, and (c) contains clue cells on microscopic examination. Gram's stain results consistent with a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis include (a) markedly reduced or absent Lactobacillus morphology, (b) predominance of Gardnerella morphotype, and (c) absent or few white blood cells.

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study involving 144 non-pregnant female patients aged 18 to 64 with a baseline Nugent score ≥ 4, Clindesse demonstrated statistically significantly higher cure rates over placebo as measured by therapeutic cure, clinical cure, and Nugent score cure, assessed at 21–30 days after administration of the drug. Therapeutic cure was a composite endpoint which required both clinical cure and Nugent score cure. Clinical cure required normal vaginal discharge, vaginal pH < 4.7, < 20% clue cells on wet mount preparation, and negative "whiff" test (detection of amine odor on addition of 10% KOH solution to sample of the vaginal discharge). A Nugent score of 0–3 was considered a Nugent score cure. The Nugent scoring is based on microscopic examination of the Gram's stained vaginal smears for quantification of specific bacterial morphotypes. Cure rates were consistently higher for Clindesse compared to p

### Women presenting to emergency departments with vaginitis should be offered single-dose empirical treatment [^116dNKcF]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

In 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a 2-g single-dose oral secnidazole (two 1-g packets) for the treatment of BV and TV, and this is currently listed as an alternative BV treatment option in U.S. CDC guidelines. Table 2 shows the results of clinical trials among women with symptomatic vaginitis comparing metronidazole, tinidazole, and secnidazole, including single-dose regimens, to treat BV and TV. For BV, when compared with metronidazole 500 mg BID for 7 days, both 2-g single-dose tinidazole and 2-g single-dose secnidazole demonstrated similar cure rates to metronidazole. Another trial comparing single doses of secnidazole, tinidazole, and metronidazole to treat BV found that tinidazole had a significantly greater clinical cure rate than metronidazole, but secnidazole did not, further supporting the efficacy of single-dose tinidazole. Across all trials for BV, a 2-g single-dose of tinidazole demonstrated clinical cure rates of 83%–100%.

- **Comparative clinical trials**: Unlike FDA guidance for comparative noninferiority trials to evaluate new antibiotics to treat other common infections, guidance for BV antimicrobial approval specifies a placebo-controlled superiority trial. Tinidazole was FDA-approved in 2004 based on a placebo-controlled trial that demonstrated the efficacy of both 2 g daily for 2 days and for 5 days. Earlier placebo-controlled trials and many comparative studies of a single 2-g dose of tinidazole were conducted outside the United States.

### Antibiofilm agents for the treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis: A systematic narrative review [^112uReir]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a neglected and poorly treated condition with a significant burden for women worldwide. In Australia, a BV prevalence of 12% was reported, compared to 30% in North America and more than 50% in southern and eastern Africa. Most affected are women of reproductive age.

BV is a polymicrobial condition with a complex pathophysiology where the native vaginal microbiome, mainly Lactobacillus species, is disrupted by increased numbers of Gardnerella species, such as G. vaginalis and G. swidsinskii/leopoldi, which grow together in biofilms with Prevotella species such as P. bivia. Significant adverse reproductive and obstetric outcomes are associated with BV, including miscarriage, preterm labor, preterm rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and an increased risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.

BV treatment has changed very little since metronidazole was first introduced 40 years ago. Due to teratogenic concerns with metronidazole during that time, clindamycin was added as an alternative in the late 1980s. Standard-of-care treatment with one of these antibiotics can achieve an initial cure rate between 80% and 90%. However, more than half of all patients experience recurrence within six months, and up to 80% within nine months of treatment. With the general increase in antimicrobial resistance, repeated use of antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent BV is clearly unsustainable.

Several factors are believed to play a role in the high recurrence rates, such as ineffective penetration of these antibiotics.

### Oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in adult females: A hybrid systematic review [^116j549X]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Data extraction was conducted using piloted forms, with risk of bias assessments and analyses carried out independently by three authors. Disagreements among authors were resolved by consensus. The risk of bias assessments for the RCTs utilized the Cochrane domain-based risk of bias tool to support conclusions regarding the overall quality of evidence in the review. Data analysis was performed using RevMan version 5.3. Dichotomous outcomes were expressed as risk ratios (RRs) with associated 95% confidence intervals (CI), while continuous outcomes were reported as mean differences (MDs) with 95% CI. Attempts to obtain missing trial details from the lead investigators were only partially successful. Although the protocol specified analyses based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle, this was not possible for most trials due to inadequate or incomplete reporting. Consequently, per-protocol (PP) populations were generally used. Side effect rates were analyzed using the ITT population with and without acne. For numbers included in each type of analysis, see Electronic Supplementary Table 1. Assessments at month 3 were used for comparisons between studies, unless otherwise stated. The GRADE software (GRADEpro GDT) rated the quality of evidence from RCTs for individual outcomes and produced summary of findings tables.

### Oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in adult females: A hybrid systematic review [^1112mbNC]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Three trials evaluated the comparison of spironolactone versus placebo. One trial provided useful data for a 200 mg daily dose in a crossover study that included 29 women. For the inflamed lesion count, the mean difference in favor of spironolactone was 26.1 fewer lesions, despite baseline imbalance favoring the placebo (p < 0.00001; per-protocol population of 21, both phases combined). Data for the first phase, which would be free of any potential carryover effects, were not reported. Combined data from both phases showed that 18 out of 21 women taking spironolactone reported improvement compared to 5 out of 21 taking placebo, indicating a relative risk (RR) of 3.6 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.64–7.89 (p = 0.001), and 15 out of 20 versus 4 out of 20 experienced at least a 50% reduction in inflamed lesion count (RR 3.75, 95% CI 1.51–9.34; p = 0.005).

In a mixed-gender randomized controlled trial (RCT), 24 out of 30 participants receiving spironolactone (50 mg/day, including 27 women) improved, compared with 2 out of 25 receiving placebo in the per-protocol population; separate data for females were unavailable. A similar issue was noted in the third trial, which also included males. Data could not be extracted for three women receiving the 50 mg dose, but 6 out of 9 women receiving doses of 100–200 mg/day showed improvement, irrespective of which outcome measures were used in the per-protocol population. Neither mixed-gender trial quantified the extent of improvement. For details and quality of evidence, refer to Table 2.

- **Grade Working Group grades of evidence**
- **High quality (⊕⊕⊕⊕)**: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.
- **Moderate quality (⊕⊕⊕◯)**: We are moderately confident in the effect estimate.

### No. 211-screening and management of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy [^114R1i6a]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2017). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for bacterial vaginosis, specifically with respect to indications for screening, the SOGC 2017 guidelines recommend that there is insufficient evidence to support screening for, or treating bacterial vaginosis in the general pregnant population to prevent adverse outcomes, such as preterm birth.

### Relationship of specific vaginal bacteria and bacterial vaginosis treatment failure in women who have sex with women [^1147XBwM]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis frequently persists after treatment. The role of newly defined bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria (BVAB), which have a specificity for this condition of 97% or greater, has not been assessed. The objective is to define risks for bacterial vaginosis persistence, including pretreatment detection of specific vaginal bacteria, among women reporting sex with women.

- **Design**: Observational cohort study.
- **Setting**: University-based research clinic.
- **Patients**: The study included 335 women aged 16 to 29 years, reporting sex with at least one woman in the past year. Participants were recruited through advertisements and provider referrals.
- **Intervention**: Bacterial vaginosis was treated with intravaginal metronidazole gel (0.75%), 37.5 mg nightly for 5 nights.
- **Measurements**: Species-specific 16S recombinant DNA polymerase chain reaction assays targeting 17 bacterial species were applied to vaginal fluid obtained at baseline. Test of cure by clinical criteria and Gram stain analysis and repeated polymerase chain reaction assays of vaginal fluid were performed 1 month after treatment, and interim behaviors were assessed by using computer-assisted self-interview.
- **Results**: Of the 335 women, 24% also reported sex with men within 3 months before enrollment. A total of 131 (39%) had bacterial vaginosis. In the 120 (92%) women who returned for follow-up, the incidence of persistent bacterial vaginosis was 26% and was statistically significantly higher in women with baseline detection of 3 Clostridiales bacteria, designated as BVAB1 (risk ratio, 2.0 [95% CI, 1.1 to 4.0]) and BVAB2 (risk ratio, 8).

### Effectiveness of spironolactone for women with acne vulgaris (SAFA) in England as well as Wales: Pragmatic, multicentre, phase 3, double blind, randomised controlled trial [^111fnaQQ]. BMJ (2023). High credibility.

The study SAFA, published by Miriam Santer and colleagues in 2023 in the journal BMJ, focuses on acne vulgaris. The trial question addressed the effect of spironolactone in female patients with acne vulgaris. The study was designed as a multicenter, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial involving 410 female patients. Inclusion criteria included adult female patients with facial acne for at least six months that was considered to warrant oral antibiotics. Key exclusion criteria were an Investigator's Global Assessment acne score of 0–1, previous use of spironolactone, use of oral isotretinoin in the past six months, and use of oral antibiotics for more than one week for acne within the previous month.

- **Interventions**:
	- N = 201 received spironolactone (50 mg/day until week 6, increasing to 100 mg/day until week 24).
	- N = 209 received a matching placebo.

- **Primary outcome**:
	- There was a significant increase in improvement in the Acne-Specific QoL symptom subscale score at week 12 (19.2 points vs. 17.8 points; AD 1.27 points, 95% CI 0.07 to 2.46).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- A significant increase in improvement in the Acne-Specific QoL symptom subscale score at week 24 (21.2 points vs. 17.4 points; AD 3.45 points, 95% CI 2.16 to 4.75).
	- The self-assessed overall improvement score of 3–6 at week 24 showed a significant increase (82% vs. 63%; OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.5 to 4.93).
	- Significant increase in the Investigator's Global Assessment for treatment success at week 12 (19% vs. 6%; OR 5.18, 95% CI 2.18 to 12.28).

### Impact of oral metronidazole treatment on the vaginal microbiota and correlates of treatment failure [^113XcAMa]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

Metronidazole is the first-line treatment for bacterial vaginosis, but cure rates are suboptimal, and recurrence rates remain high.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the impact of a standard course of oral metronidazole treatment (500 mg twice per day for 7 days) on the vaginal microbiota of Rwandan bacterial vaginosis patients using microscopy and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and to evaluate correlates of treatment failure.

- **Study design**: HIV-negative, nonpregnant women aged 18–45 years with bacterial vaginosis and/or Trichomonas vaginalis (N = 68) were interviewed and sampled before and after metronidazole treatment. They were also screened, and treated if applicable, for other urogenital infections. The vaginal microbiota was assessed by Gram stain Nugent scoring, Illumina 16S rRNA HiSeq sequencing (relative abundances), and BactQuant 16S gene quantitative polymerase chain reaction (estimated concentrations). Only women with a pretreatment Nugent score of 7–10 and a valid posttreatment Nugent score (N = 55) were included in metronidazole treatment failure analyses, with treatment failure defined as a posttreatment Nugent score of 4–10.

- **Results**: The bacterial vaginosis cure rate by Nugent scoring was 54.5%. The mean total vaginal bacterial concentration declined from 6.59 to 5.85 log 10/μL (p < 0.001), which was mostly due to a reduction in mean bacterial vaginosis-associated anaerobes concentration (all bacterial vaginosis-associated anaerobe taxa combined) from 6.23 to 4.55 log 10/μL (p < 0.001). However, only 16.4% of women had a bacterial vaginosis anaerobes concentration reduction.

### Oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in adult females: A hybrid systematic review [^115c1F1P]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

The management of acne in adult females is problematic, with many having a history of treatment failure and some having a predisposition to androgen excess. Alternatives to oral antibiotics and combined oral contraceptives (COCs) are required.

- **Objective**: Our aim was to conduct a hybrid systematic review of the evidence for benefits and potential harms of oral spironolactone in the management of acne in adult females.

- **Methods**: The review was conducted according to a previously published protocol. Three reviewers independently selected relevant studies from the search results, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias, and rated the quality of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

- **Results**: Ten randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 21 case series were retrieved. All trials were assessed as being at a 'high risk' of bias, and the quality of evidence was rated as low or very low for all outcomes. Apart from one crossover trial that demonstrated statistical superiority of a 200 mg daily dose versus inflamed lesions compared with placebo, data from the remaining trials were unhelpful in establishing the degree of efficacy of lower doses versus active comparators or placebo. Menstrual side effects were significantly more common with the 200 mg dose; frequency could be significantly reduced by concomitant use of a COC. Pooling of results for serum potassium supported the recent recommendation that routine monitoring is not required in this patient population.

### Nuvessa [^112YuMtv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

A single, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of Nuvessa. Subjects had a clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis defined by the presence of a homogenous vaginal discharge that (a) had a pH ≥ 4.7, (b) emitted a "fishy" amine odor when mixed with a 10% KOH solution ("whiff" test), and (c) contained clue cells ≥ 20% of the total vaginal epithelial cells. To be eligible for analysis, subjects must have had a Gram stain Nugent score ≥ 4 and have been negative for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis. Non-pregnant females at least 18 years of age were randomized 1:1 to either Nuvessa or Vehicle Gel and instructed to administer the study drug once at bedtime. Two hundred ninety-two Nuvessa subjects and 285 Vehicle Gel subjects were eligible for the analysis.

Clinical cure was defined as (a) return of normal physiologic discharge, (b) negative KOH "whiff" test, and (c) clue cells < 20% of the total vaginal epithelial cells at the test of cure visit (between 21 to 30 days post-treatment). Bacteriological cure was defined as a Nugent score of < 4, and therapeutic cure was defined as both clinical cure and bacteriological cure. Nuvessa demonstrated statistically significantly higher cure rates over Vehicle Gel as measured by clinical cure, bacteriological cure, and therapeutic cure.

Clinical cure and bacteriological cure were also assessed at Day 7. Clinical cure at Day 7 was achieved by a statistically significantly greater proportion of subjects in the Nuvessa group compared to subjects using the Vehicle Gel.

### Prevotella and gardnerella are associated with treatment failure following first-line antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis [^116zQFCV]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal condition that affects approximately 30% of reproductive-aged women globally. While the etiology of BV has not been established, the vaginal microbiota of women with BV is typically deficient in optimal Lactobacillus spp (e.g. Lactobacillus crispatus), with high diversity and high abundance of anaerobes. The recommended treatment for BV involves antibiotic therapy with metronidazole or clindamycin, both of which provide broad coverage of anaerobes. One-month cure post-treatment is approximately 70%–85%; however, up to 50% of women experience BV recurrence within 12 weeks following antibiotics. BV recurrences are distressing for women and result in repeat presentations to clinical services and repeated antibiotic use. Furthermore, the sequelae associated with BV carry significant implications for a woman's reproductive and sexual health and impose a large economic burden.

There has been little progress made toward improving long-term BV cure, partly because the mechanisms driving BV recurrence are multifactorial and incompletely understood. Prior studies exploring the association between microbial signatures of the vaginal microbiota (i.e. diversity metrics, community types, and individual taxa) and BV treatment outcomes have produced mixed results regarding the contribution of bacterial diversity to treatment failure. Interestingly, a number of studies have reported a positive association between BV recurrence and high relative and absolute abundance of Gardnerella (or individual Gardnerella spp) pretreatment.

### Antibiotics for treating bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy [^117KbQeT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis is an imbalance of the normal vaginal flora, characterized by an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria and a lack of the normal lactobacillary flora. During pregnancy, bacterial vaginosis has been associated with poor perinatal outcomes, particularly preterm birth. Identification and treatment may reduce the risk of preterm birth and its consequences.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antibiotic treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register in September 2002.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials comparing antibiotic treatment with placebo or no treatment, or comparing two or more antibiotic regimens in pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently assessed trials and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information.

- **Main results**: Ten trials involving 4,249 women were included; all were of good quality. Antibiotic therapy was effective at eradicating bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy (odds ratio [OR] 0.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.18 to 0.24, eight trials of 3,825 women). Treatment did not significantly reduce the risk of preterm birth before 37 weeks (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.10, eight trials of 4,062 women), 34 weeks (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.07, five trials of 851 women), or 32 weeks (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.68, three trials of 3,080 women). However, antibiotic treatment significantly decreased the risk of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.45).

### Antibiotics for treating bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy [^1145wKx4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis is an imbalance of the normal vaginal flora, characterized by an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria and a reduction of normal lactobacillary flora. During pregnancy, bacterial vaginosis has been linked to poor perinatal outcomes, particularly preterm birth. Identification and treatment may reduce the risk of preterm birth and its adverse effects.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antibiotic treatment for bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register up to May 2004.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials comparing antibiotic treatment with placebo or no treatment, or comparing two or more antibiotic regimens in pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis or intermediate vaginal flora, were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers assessed trials and independently extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information.

- **Main results**: Thirteen trials involving 5,300 women were included; all were of good quality. Antibiotic therapy effectively eradicated bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy (odds ratio (OR) 0.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.24) based on nine trials with 3,895 women. However, treatment was not significant in reducing the risk of preterm birth before 37 weeks (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.03, thirteen trials with 5,300 women), with significant heterogeneity between trials (p-value 0.002). It also did not significantly reduce preterm birth before 34 weeks (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.19, five trials with 851 women) or before 32 weeks (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.70, four trials with 3,565 women).

### Treatment of bacterial vaginosis before 28 weeks of pregnancy to reduce the incidence of preterm labor [^114H3Y9u]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2019). Low credibility.

Controversy exists regarding the benefits of treating bacterial vaginosis (BV) during pregnancy to reduce the incidence of preterm labor (PTL).

- **Objectives**: To evaluate whether treatment of BV with vaginal clindamycin or oral metronidazole before 28 weeks of pregnancy reduces PTL incidence.

- **Search strategy**: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, CENTRAL, and SciELO databases were searched until December 30, 2017. Search terms included "bacterial vaginosis" and "preterm labor". No language restrictions were applied.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized clinical trials that evaluated treatment of BV with clindamycin or metronidazole to reduce PTL incidence.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The risk of PTL was evaluated by the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Dichotomous data from each study were combined for meta-analysis using the Mantel-Haenszel model.

- **Main results**: Nine reports were included in the systematic review, with eight reports included in the meta-analysis. No reduction in the incidence of PTL was found for either metronidazole (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.71–1.25) or clindamycin (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.75–1.36).

- **Conclusions**: Use of oral metronidazole or vaginal clindamycin to treat BV before 28 weeks of pregnancy did not reduce the incidence of PTL. PROSPERO registration: CRD42018086173.

### Prevotella and gardnerella are associated with treatment failure following first-line antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis [^11249m4D]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Analysis of compositions of microbiomes with bias correction (ANCOM-BC) version 1.6.2 was used to identify differentially abundant taxa between recurrence and cure cases pre- and immediately post-treatment. ANCOM-BC analyses were adjusted for laboratory method, and taxa present in ≤ 10% of samples were excluded. Bacterial taxa identified as differentially abundant by ANCOM-BC with a P value < 0.05 were further explored using logistic regression. Logistic regression examined the association between BV recurrence and the centered log-ratio (CLR)–transformed abundance of each taxon, adjusting for laboratory method and partner type/treatment status.

Finally, using an approach similar to Lee et al, we explored the relationship between BV recurrence and the ratio of nonoptimal to optimal bacteria present in the vagina pre- and post-treatment. The following ratios were examined:

- **Total BV-associated bacteria to Lactobacillus spp (BVAB: Lactobacillus)**: Evaluating the bacterial balance pre- and post-treatment.

- **Gardnerella to Lactobacillus iners (Gardnerella: L iners)**: Investigating bacterial dynamics relevant to recurrence.

- **Total pathobionts to Lactobacillus spp (pathobionts: Lactobacillus)**: Pathobionts are organisms that may become inflammatory and pathogenic under specific conditions, and high pretreatment pathobiont load has been associated with metronidazole treatment failure.

Ratios were calculated using log 10-transformed relative abundance data, and the association between BV recurrence and bacterial ratios was evaluated using logistic regression models, adjusted as above.

### Optimizing the trial design for a comparative effectiveness study of spironolactone versus oral antibiotics for women with acne: A Delphi consensus panel [^113VSipv]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

For women with acne, the condition often persists into adulthood, with over 50% of women reporting acne between 20–29 years of age and over 35% of women experiencing acne between 30–39 years of age. While mild acne can usually be managed with topical medications, moderate to severe acne often requires treatment with systemic medications such as oral antibiotics, spironolactone, and isotretinoin. Although oral antibiotics are the most common systemic medication prescribed for women with moderate to severe acne, spironolactone may represent a safe and effective therapeutic alternative that can decrease reliance on oral antibiotics for the treatment of acne. However, while spironolactone use is increasing, oral antibiotics are still prescribed three to five times more often than spironolactone.

### Bacterial vaginosis: Drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^115BEA6z]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal dysbiosis affecting women globally. An unacceptably high proportion of women experience BV recurrence within six months of recommended antibiotic therapy. The low rate of sustained cure highlights our limited understanding of the pathogenesis of BV recurrence. This issue has been attributed to the possible persistence and re-emergence of BV-associated bacteria (BVAB) or a BV-associated biofilm following antimicrobials and/or reinfection from sexual partners.

There is robust evidence supporting the exchange of bacteria between partners during sexual activity. While the hypothesis that women treated for BV are subsequently reinfected with BVAB following sex with an untreated sexual partner is not new, past partner treatment trials have eroded confidence in this concept. If reinfection is a key driver of recurrence, antimicrobial regimens directed at women alone are unlikely to achieve a high level of sustained cure. Thus, the approach of partner treatment to reduce reinfection is justified. This manuscript presents the molecular and epidemiological evidence underlying the hypothesis that BV is sexually transmitted and summarizes why research considering sexual partnerships is necessary. It also outlines the significant barriers and challenges identified in partner treatment studies and discusses the factors impacting the ability to determine their effectiveness.

### Bacterial vaginosis: Drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^113ZE7fJ]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

There are an additional set of challenges when recruiting couples for male-partner treatment trials. Women are often reluctant to disclose their symptoms to men and may require educational material and support to increase their confidence in discussing their bacterial vaginosis (BV) and the associated morbidities with their partner. Motivating male partners to participate is also made more difficult by the fact that most men do not experience symptoms themselves. This was highlighted by men participating in partner treatment trials, who reported BV to have little impact on themselves beyond their concerns for their partner's health, self-esteem, and confidence.

Interestingly, some men identified that the diagnosis of BV in their female partner led to improved communication within the partnership about sex and sexual health. They noted that accepting partner treatment showed they were committed to the relationship and could be a supportive partner. Further research is required to identify the factors that may motivate male participants to partake in BV treatment trials.

Fundamentally, we still do not know what the most appropriate and effective antibiotic agents are for male partners. Nearly all the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating partner treatment have used oral metronidazole. Metronidazole, a nitroimidazole antibiotic with broad activity against anaerobic bacteria, achieves 1-month cure rates of over 80% among women. Less than 1% of anaerobic bacteria isolated from women pre-treated with a 5-day intravaginal metronidazole demonstrated resistance.

### Characterization and treatment of recurrent bacterial vaginosis [^114h7Zfb]. Journal of Women's Health (2019). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common but treatable condition, with several effective treatments available, including oral and intravaginal metronidazole, clindamycin, and oral tinidazole. However, as many as 50% of women with BV experience recurrence within one year of treatment. Some reasons for recurrence include the persistence of residual infection, resistance, and possibly reinfection from either male or female partners. Persistence may occur due to the formation of a biofilm that protects BV-causing bacteria from antimicrobial therapy. Poor adherence to treatment among patients with genitourinary infections may lead to resistance. However, the underlying mechanisms of recurrent BV (reBV) are not well understood.

Recommended treatment for reBV consists of an extended course of metronidazole treatment (500 mg twice daily for 10–14 days). If ineffective, metronidazole vaginal gel 0.75% for 10 days, followed by two times per week for 3–6 months, is an alternate treatment regimen. Past studies of clindamycin and tinidazole in the treatment of reBV have focused on patients with evidence of metronidazole resistance. Secnidazole may be an attractive new option due to its one-time dosing. Initial studies on biofilm disruption, use of probiotics and prebiotics, and botanical treatments have shown some promise but must be studied further before being used in the clinic. Despite limitations, antimicrobial therapy will remain the mainstay of treatment for reBV for the foreseeable future.

Regarding the medical management of bacterial vaginosis, specifically in terms of antibiotic therapy, the SOGC 2015 guidelines recommend offering oral metronidazole 500 mg BID for 7 days to patients with symptomatic BV. As alternatives, vaginal metronidazole gel and oral or vaginal clindamycin cream are recommended.

### Antibiofilm agents for the treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis: A systematic narrative review [^111HNDm7]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is difficult to eradicate due to BV biofilms protecting BV bacteria, such as Gardnerella, Prevotella, and other genera. With the growing understanding of biofilms, we systematically reviewed the knowledge on the efficacy of anti-BV biofilm agents.

- **Methods**: We searched literature in the Scopus, Medline, and Embase databases for empirical studies investigating substances for the treatment of BV biofilms or prevention of their recurrence and assessed their efficacy and/or safety.

- **Results**: Of 201 unique titles, 35 satisfied the inclusion criteria. Most studies (89%) reported on preclinical laboratory research on the efficacy of experimental antibiofilm agents (80%) rather than their safety. Over 50% were published within the past 5 years. Agents were classified into seven groups: antibiotics, antiseptics, cationic peptides, enzymes, plant extracts, probiotics, and surfactants/surfactant components. Enzymes and probiotics were most commonly investigated. Earlier reports of antibiotics having anti-BV biofilm activity have not been confirmed. Some compounds from other classes demonstrated promising anti-BV biofilm efficacy in early studies.

- **Conclusions**: Further research is anticipated on successful antibiofilm agents. If confirmed as effective and safe in human clinical trials, they may offer a breakthrough in BV treatment. With rising antibiotic resistance, antibiofilm agents will significantly improve the standard of care for BV management.

### Antibiofilm agents for the treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis: A systematic narrative review [^111wuo2N]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Various potential BV biofilm removal treatments are currently being actively investigated. We grouped these treatments into seven classes: antibiotics, antiseptics, cationic peptides, enzymes, plant extracts, probiotics, and surfactants/surfactant components. Within the last five years, enzymes and probiotics were most investigated, although these substances are still in the early stages of development with their efficacy yet to be demonstrated through human trials. The growing knowledge about BV biofilms is anticipated to stimulate research in this area.

In vivo biofilms contain multiple BV-associated bacterial species, but some are nonculturable in the laboratory setting. In general, laboratory studies tended to use single-species G vaginalis biofilms, which does not reflect the multispecies biofilm conditions in vivo. This limitation was noted by a number of authors within their articles. Several publications attempted to use multispecies biofilm models, noting a higher treatment resistance when compared with single-species biofilms. In addition, the safety and tolerability of the treatment were not adequately measured in most studies. Future research should not only prioritize the testing of these agents in biofilm models that better approximate in vivo conditions but also measure safety and tolerability through clinical trials.

Antibiotic treatments have always been the standard of care for BV. Narrow-spectrum antibiotics have a selective mechanism of action and target specific species of bacteria while minimally affecting other bacterial populations.

### Bacterial vaginosis: Drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^112u1cXw]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

There is long-standing evidence to support the contribution of sexual transmission to the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis (BV). In the 1950s, Gardner and Dukes first characterized BV and hypothesized that "… husbands must be treated simultaneously if recurrences by reinfection are to be prevented". When vaginal discharge was transferred from women with BV to those without, 11 out of 15 women developed clinical signs and microbiological features of BV, indicating the BV syndrome was infectious.

Initially, Gardnerella vaginalis was isolated from women with BV and was hypothesized to be a new sexually transmitted infection (STI) responsible for the syndrome. However, when 13 'healthy' women were inoculated with pure cultures of G. vaginalis, which were incubated for 24 hours prior to inoculation and in the stationary phase of growth, only one developed BV. In a subsequent study using fresh cultures of G. vaginalis incubated for 12 hours prior to inoculation and in the late logarithmic phase of growth, 5 out of 9 women developed the BV syndrome. This finding suggests that the phase of growth and environmental signals may control the expression of bacterial virulence factors, conferring a greater pathogenic potential to G. vaginalis, a finding supported by more recent evidence.

Supporting the initial hypothesis that G. vaginalis is the etiologic agent responsible for BV, it was isolated from the urethra of 91 out of 101 husbands of women with BV, but only 1 out of 38 male medical students. Successive studies also isolated G. vaginalis from the urethra of male partners of women with BV.

### Dequalinium chloride for the treatment of vulvovaginal infections: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113zKJ5z]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2024). Low credibility.

Women at reproductive age frequently experience vulvovaginal infections and vaginitis. The most common etiologies are vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), bacterial vaginosis (BV), desquamative inflammatory vaginitis/aerobic vaginitis, and trichomoniasis. Various treatment options are available for these infections, such as specific antimicrobial or antiseptic agents. Dequalinium chloride (DQC) is a local antiseptic agent with a broad antimicrobial and antifungal spectrum. Multiple studies suggest that DQC is an efficient treatment for vaginal infections; however, it is not widely recommended as a first-line treatment. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the efficacy of DQC compared with that of standard treatment.

- **Methods**: Our systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and clinicaltrials.org were searched to retrieve relevant reports up to October 2022.

- **Results**: Four randomized controlled studies and one observational study were included in this review. Overall, DQC showed noninferiority to the reference treatments for BV and VVC, and to the evaluated treatment options for desquamative inflammatory vaginitis/aerobic vaginitis. For BV and VVC, this could also be confirmed in a meta-analysis, including three randomized controlled studies. No serious adverse events were reported in any of these studies.

- **Conclusions**: Dequalinium chloride offers a safe, well-tolerated, and efficient treatment option for vulvovaginal infections of different etiologies. However, further studies are needed to…

### Tindamax [^114TLxrK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 235 non-pregnant women was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of tinidazole in treating bacterial vaginosis. A clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis was based on Amsel's criteria and defined by the presence of abnormal homogeneous vaginal discharge that (a) has a pH greater than 4.5, (b) emits a "fishy" amine odor when mixed with a 10% KOH solution, and (c) contains ≥ 20% clue cells on microscopic examination. Clinical cure required a return to normal vaginal discharge and resolution of all Amsel's criteria.

A microbiologic diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis was based on a Gram stain of the vaginal smear demonstrating (a) markedly reduced or absent Lactobacillus morphology, (b) predominance of Gardnerella morphotype, and (c) absent or few white blood cells, with quantification of these bacterial morphotypes to determine the Nugent score, where a score ≥ 4 was required for study inclusion and a score of 0–3 considered a microbiologic cure. Therapeutic cure was a composite endpoint, consisting of both a clinical cure and microbiologic cure.

In patients with all four of Amsel's criteria and a baseline Nugent score ≥ 4, tinidazole oral tablets, given as either 2 g once daily for 2 days or 1 g once daily for 5 days, demonstrated superior efficacy over placebo tablets as measured by therapeutic cure, clinical cure, and microbiologic cure.

### Bacterial vaginosis: Drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^111fm2df]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Despite bacterial vaginosis (BV) being common among women who have sex with women (WSW), no partner treatment trials enrolling female couples have been conducted. The majority (74–95%) of female couples have been shown to be concordant for the presence or absence of BV. If a female index case is enrolled in a partner treatment trial, it is highly likely that her female partner will also be concordant for the presence of BV. Enrolling female couples would therefore provide an opportunity to determine the effectiveness of partner treatment in both members of the partnership.

However, female-partner treatment introduces a unique set of challenges. Enrolling BV-concordant couples in a blinded randomized partner treatment trial would mean that only half of the female partners would be treated for BV at enrollment, as the rest would be randomized to placebo. The concept of a placebo arm for women may not be accepted by participants or clinicians. Apprehension concerning the ethics of non-treatment could be mitigated by considering that it has not been shown that treating BV prevents adverse outcomes, only symptoms, and if one of the partners has asymptomatic BV at enrollment, treatment would not currently be recommended. FDA guidance around BV treatment trials also states that a placebo can be used as a comparator for the control arm, and recent BV treatment trials have followed this guideline.

Even if partner treatment was accepted, in order to measure a clinically meaningful cure, follow-up to 3–4 months is required. Concerns regarding possible ethical and practical challenges must also be addressed.

### Antibiofilm agents for the treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis: A systematic narrative review [^1131FLM7]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is challenging to eradicate due to the protective nature of BV biofilms, which shield bacteria such as Gardnerella and Prevotella. As the understanding of biofilms improves, we systematically reviewed the knowledge on the efficacy of anti-BV biofilm agents.

We conducted a literature search using Scopus, Medline, and Embase databases to identify empirical studies exploring substances aimed at treating BV biofilms or preventing their recurrence, focusing on efficacy and safety.

Out of 201 unique titles, 35 met the inclusion criteria. The majority of studies (89%) addressed preclinical laboratory research on the efficacy of experimental antibiofilm agents (80%) rather than their safety. Over 50% of these studies were published in the past five years. Agents were categorized into seven groups: antibiotics, antiseptics, cationic peptides, enzymes, plant extracts, probiotics, and surfactants/surfactant components. Enzymes and probiotics were the most frequently investigated. Earlier claims of antibiotics exhibiting anti-BV biofilm activity have not been substantiated. However, several compounds from other classes showed promising anti-BV biofilm efficacy in preliminary studies.

Further research on successful antibiofilm agents is anticipated. If shown to be effective and safe in human clinical trials, these agents could provide a breakthrough in BV treatment. As antibiotic resistance increases, antibiofilm agents will significantly enhance the standard of care for BV management.

### Prevotella and gardnerella are associated with treatment failure following first-line antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis [^111nhBpc]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

We conducted a secondary analysis of vaginal microbiota data and accompanying clinical and behavioral data collected from women who participated in three clinical trials conducted at the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre (MSHC), Australia. These trials evaluated new interventions for improving BV cure: Strategies to prevent BV (SToPBV), StepUp-1, and StepUp-2. The parent trials have been described elsewhere.

In brief, SToPBV was an open-label randomized controlled trial of combined oral contraceptive pill use following first-line antibiotic treatment to prevent BV recurrence. StepUp-1 and StepUp-2 were open-label single-arm pilot studies that assessed the acceptability and tolerability of male partner treatment for BV and its impact on the genital microbiota of couples. The supplementary material details the interventions assessed in the parent studies.

Across the three studies, women presenting to MSHC were eligible to participate if they were diagnosed with BV, defined as ≥ 3 Amsel criteria and a Nugent score (NS) of 4–10, and received first-line treatment. The treatment options were oral metronidazole 400 mg twice daily for 7 days; clindamycin 2% vaginal cream applied intravaginally at night for 7 nights if metronidazole was contraindicated; or metronidazole 0.75% gel applied intravaginally at night for 5 nights. Additional study-specific eligibility criteria were applied. Of note, women were eligible for SToPBV if they were not currently using hormonal contraception and had no contraindications related to combined oral contraceptive pills.

### Treatment considerations for bacterial vaginosis and the risk of recurrence [^1117pJbh]. Journal of Women's Health (2009). Low credibility.

Recommended regimens for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV) have similar efficacy; thus, the choice of treatment should consider additional factors such as the risk of BV recurrence and the side effect profile. The purpose of this study was to investigate the recurrence rates of BV and the rates of acquiring vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) after different BV treatments in a commercially insured population.

- **Methods**: Private administrative insurance claims from 2004 to 2006 were used. Study subjects were continuously enrolled females aged 12–50 years who filled prescriptions for BV treatment (n = 32,268). The four BV treatments (single-dose clindamycin vaginal cream (2%), multiple-dose clindamycin vaginal regimens, vaginal metronidazole, and oral metronidazole) were compared for rates of recurrence of BV and VVC after treatment using multivariate analyses. Covariates included sociodemographic and clinical characteristics.

- **Results**: Overall, the rates of BV recurrence (2.7%) and VVC post-treatment (2.9%) were low. Women who were treated with single-dose clindamycin vaginal cream (2%) showed no significant difference from women treated with oral metronidazole in the likelihood of BV recurrence. However, women who received other vaginal treatments were significantly more likely to experience BV recurrence compared with women who received oral metronidazole (p < 0.01). Moreover, women who were treated with single-dose clindamycin vaginal cream (2%) and vaginal metronidazole were significantly less likely to have VVC compared with those treated with oral metronidazole (p < 0.01).

### Oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in adult females: A hybrid systematic review [^116XzeZJ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

- **Results**

- **Study characteristics**: Full details of the study selection process are reported in Fig. 1. We identified 10 RCTs, 18 case series in which acne status or severity was an outcome, and three articles reporting on the side effects of spironolactone in female patients with acne, which contained no data on clinical outcomes. Eleven studies were out of scope, and five were unobtainable (see Electronic Supplementary Table 2).

- **Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)**: All 10 RCTs were single-center studies conducted in Canada (1), UK (2), India (3), Bangladesh (1), Thailand (1), Israel (1), and China (1). Baseline acne severity ranged from mild to severe and was not reported in four trials. The sites affected by acne were reported for seven trials and always included the face. Of the four trials that included males, two reported results for females separately, and two did not. Six trials did not mention any sources of funding. One was funded by a manufacturer of spironolactone, two were funded by non-industrial sponsors, and one received no support from a pharmaceutical company. A spironolactone manufacturer supplied the active and placebo treatment in two trials. Declarations stating no conflicts of interest were provided for two trials.

### Efficacy of dequalinium chloride vs metronidazole for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis: A randomized clinical trial [^116r5TdA]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The study on the efficacy of dequalinium chloride in bacterial vaginosis (BV) was published by Grzegorz Raba and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA Network Open. This study investigates whether dequalinium chloride is noninferior to metronidazole in women with bacterial vaginosis. The trial was conducted as a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial (RCT), involving a population of 147 female patients.

The inclusion criteria focused on adult premenopausal women diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis. Key exclusion criteria included uterine or vaginal bleeding of unknown origin, ulcerations or erosions of the vaginal mucosa or cervix, candidiasis, aerobic vaginitis, sexually transmitted infections, severe systemic diseases, hypersensitivity to the study medications, and pregnancy.

The interventions involved administering dequalinium chloride to 72 participants in the form of vaginal tablets (10 mg once daily for 6 days), while 75 participants received metronidazole orally (500 mg twice daily for 7 days).

The primary outcome measured was the clinical cure rate at visit 1 (7–11 days after the start of treatment), which showed dequalinium chloride to have a cure rate of 92.8%, compared to 93.2% for metronidazole, with a difference not exceeding the non-inferiority margin (ARD -0.5, 95% CI -10.8 to 9.8).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in the clinical cure rate at visit 2 (20–40 days after the start of treatment): 79.7% vs. 87.3% (ARD -7.6, 95% CI -20.1 to 4.8).
	- **No significant difference in the bacteriologic cure rate at visit 2**: 40.6% vs. 53.5% (ARD -12.9, 95% CI -29.3 to 3.4).
	- No significant difference in standard Amsel criteria cure rate.

### Antibiofilm agents for the treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis: A systematic narrative review [^113zCB82]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

- **Results**:

- **Literature search results**: Of 333 articles identified, 201 unique titles and abstracts were screened against inclusion/exclusion criteria, and 49 proceeded to full-text review. Of those, 13 were excluded due to the investigation of non-BV-associated bacteria or for not studying BV-specific biofilms. Two articles, despite meeting all selection criteria, were additionally excluded during data extraction as their results could not be adequately extracted. Citation chaining yielded 1 additional eligible reference, bringing the final number of publications to 35.

- **Characteristics of included publications**: All articles were published in English, starting from 1998. Over 50% (n = 18) were published in the past 5 years (January 2017–May 2023). Of 35 publications, 18 originated in Europe (Germany and Portugal, 5 each; United Kingdom, 3; Austria and Italy, 2 each; Belgium, 1), 9 from North America (United States, 7; Canada, 2), and 8 from Asia (China, 6; Korea and Taiwan, 1 each).

The studies were predominantly carried out on laboratory cell cultures, reflecting the early stage of research. The types of research facilities conducting experiments were not described; however, the author affiliations suggest a variety of settings, such as university, hospital, and industrial research laboratories. Experimental agents were predominantly used alone and mostly to eradicate BV biofilms rather than prevent their formation. Nine studies sought to evaluate the efficacy of the investigative therapeutic in combination with other antimicrobials.

### Secnidazole treatment of bacterial vaginosis: A randomized controlled trial [^117PdSop]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). High credibility.

To evaluate secnidazole as a single oral dose treatment for bacterial vaginosis, a phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted. In this study, women with bacterial vaginosis who met all Amsel criteria (discharge; pH 4.7 or greater; 20% or greater clue cells; positive whiff test) were randomized in a one-to-one-to-one ratio at 24 U.S. centers to receive either 1 or 2 g secnidazole, or a placebo.

The primary endpoint was clinical cure, defined as the normalization of discharge, amine odor, and clue cells, evaluated 21–30 days after treatment. Secondary endpoints included microbiologic cure, defined by a Nugent score of 0–3, and therapeutic cure, defined as meeting criteria for both clinical and microbiologic cure.

The modified intent to treat was used for efficacy analyses and included all randomized patients who met the enrollment criteria. Assuming a clinical cure rate of 40% in the active groups and 15% in the placebo group, a sample size of 52 patients per group was needed to provide approximately 80% power to detect a significant difference between groups at the .05 level (two-sided) using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test.

Between May and September 2014, 215 patients were enrolled. In the intent-to-treat population, the clinical cure rate was 65.3% for the 2-g group, 49.3% for the 1-g group, and 19.4% for the placebo group. The modified intent-to-treat population included 188 women (median age 33 years; 32% with four or more bacterial vaginosis episodes in the previous year; 54% black) with baseline Nugent scores of 4 or greater.

### Clindesse [^113P8M3a]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In a second controlled clinical study involving 432 patients aged 18 to 78 with a baseline Nugent score of ≥ 4, 221 women self-administered a single dose of Clindesse, and 211 women self-administered a single daily dose of a formulation of clindamycin vaginal cream for 7 days. A single dose of Clindesse was shown to be similar to 7 daily doses of the clindamycin vaginal cream for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis, as measured by therapeutic cure, clinical cure, and Nugent score cure, assessed at 21–30 days after administration of the drug in the modified intent-to-treat population and for the per protocol population. The study endpoints were identical to those described for the placebo-controlled study. Statistical analyses did not reveal any significant differences when controlling for the following demographic variables: age, race, height, weight, sexual behavior, and recalcitrant infection status.

### Metronidazole [^114Rr35y]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Metronidazole extended-release 750 mg tablets are indicated for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV) in non-pregnant women. To prevent the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of metronidazole extended-release tablets and other antibacterial drugs, they should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.

When culture and susceptibility data are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may guide the empiric selection of therapy.

### Prevotella and gardnerella are associated with treatment failure following first-line antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis [^113LgHuK]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal dysbiosis that often recurs following first-line antibiotics. This study investigates whether vaginal microbiota composition is associated with BV recurrence.

We analyzed samples and data from 121 women who participated in three published trials evaluating novel interventions for improving BV cure, including conAntibiotic treatment of regular sexual partners (RSPs). Women diagnosed with BV received first-line antibiotics and self-collected vaginal swabs pretreatment and the day after finishing antibiotics (immediately posttreatment). 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on vaginal samples. Logistic regression explored associations between BV recurrence and features of the vaginal microbiota pre- and posttreatment.

Sixteen women (13% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 8%–21%]) experienced BV recurrence within one month of treatment. Women with an untreated RSP were more likely to experience recurrence than women with no RSP (P = 0.008) or an RSP who received treatment (P = 0.011). A higher abundance of Prevotella pretreatment (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.35 [95% CI, 1.05–1.91]) and Gardnerella immediately posttreatment (AOR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.03–1.49]) were associated with increased odds of BV recurrence.

Having specific Prevotella spp. prior to recommended treatment and persistence of Gardnerella immediately posttreatment may contribute to the high rates of BV recurrence. Interventions that target these taxa are likely required to achieve sustained BV cure.

Regarding medical management for Trichomonas vaginalis infection, specifically concerning antibiotic therapy, the WHO 2024 guidelines recommend considering the administration of any of the following options if adherence to multiple doses is a serious concern:

- **Metronidazole 2 g PO**: Administer as a single dose.
- **Tinidazole 2 g PO**: Administer as a single dose, except during pregnancy.
- **Secnidazole 2 g PO**: Administer as a single dose, except during pregnancy.
- **Ornidazole 1.5 g PO**: Administer as a single dose, except during pregnancy, if metronidazole or tinidazole is not available.

### Single-dose, bioadhesive clindamycin 2% gel for bacterial vaginosis: A randomized controlled trial [^113o53sW]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

The objective of the study was to assess the efficacy and safety of a single-dose vaginal clindamycin gel for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.

- **Methods**: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study comparing clindamycin gel with placebo in a 2:1 ratio. Entry required a clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, defined by all four of Amsel's criteria, without other genital infections. Nugent scores of 7–10 were required for efficacy assessment, according to updated 2019 U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidance. Patients were evaluated at screening, day 7–14, and day 21–30 (test of cure). Clinical cure was defined as the resolution of three of the four Amsel's criteria. Bacteriologic cure was defined as a Nugent score lower than 4. Therapeutic cure required both clinical and bacteriologic cures. The primary outcome was the clinical cure at the test-of-cure visit. Secondary endpoints included clinical cure at day 7–14, and bacteriologic and therapeutic cures at day 7–14 and test of cure. A sample size of 188 patients in the clindamycin group compared with 94 patients in the placebo group provided 90% power to detect a statistically significant difference (P = 0.05, two-tailed).

- **Results**: Participants were seen between July 9, 2020, and November 12, 2020. Among the 307 randomized women, 56.0% were Black and 88.3% reported one or more previous episodes of bacterial vaginosis. In the modified intention-to-treat population, 70.5% of patients in the clindamycin group and 35.6% in the placebo group achieved clinical cure at test of cure (primary outcome) [difference of 34.9, 95% CI 19.0–50.8], as did 77.5% of patients in the clindamycin group and 42.6% in the placebo group.

### Bacterial vaginosis: Drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^116Ac4vJ]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Recommended first-line antimicrobial treatments, metronidazole or clindamycin, provide broad anaerobic coverage and are administered orally or intravaginally. These regimens have similar efficacy and cure approximately 70–85% of women with BV within 1 month; however, more than 50% experience recurrence of symptoms and BV on microscopy within 6 months. The low rate of sustained cure not only highlights our incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis of BV recurrence, but also compounds women's distress and frustration and leads to repeated presentation to health services or adoption of unproven home remedies.

Factors that may play a role in recurrence include:

- **Persistence of a BV-associated biofilm**: Failure to recolonize the vagina with lactobacilli.
- **Reinfection from an untreated partner**: Host genetic and/or immune factors.

Frustratingly for both clinicians and patients, the contribution of reinfection and vaginal relapse cannot be separated, as the clinical presentation of both mechanisms of recurrence is identical. Point-of-care laboratory tests cannot resolve this issue yet, and molecular methods, including next-generation sequencing, are unable to identify a unique or specific microbial signature to separate the two routes of recurrence. While persistence or resistance of BVAB or BV biofilm following antibiotic therapy is likely to be the dominant mechanism among some women, there is a robust body of evidence to support the exchange of both optimal and detrimental bacteria between partners during sexual activity.

### Bacterial vaginosis: Drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^115p1hzt]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

What is clear now is that there is a substantial body of epidemiological and microbiological data to support the role of sexual transmission in the BV syndrome. As is the case for established sexually transmitted infections (STIs), prevalent BV is associated with an earlier age of sexual debut and is uncommon in women reporting no sexual activity. In a 12-month cohort study, young women engaging in penile-vaginal sex were more likely to have a vaginal microbiota dominated by Gardnerella spp. than women reporting no sex, and in a cross-sectional study of 17- and 18-year-old women, the presence and abundance of G. vaginalis, A. vaginae, and P. bivia were associated with a history of penile-vaginal sex. Furthermore, a meta-analysis showed a positive association between an increased number of male sexual partners or a recent change of male partner and the risk of BV (relative risk [RR] = 1.6, 95% CI 1.5–1.8). Conversely, consistent condom use was associated with a decreased risk of BV (RR = 0.8, 95% CI 0.8–0.9).

### Oral spironolactone for acne vulgaris in adult females: A hybrid systematic review [^1135W71s]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

While endorsing key aspects of expert opinion with hard data and providing new insights, this systematic review highlights existing important gaps in the evidence regarding the optimal use of oral spironolactone in managing acne in women. This includes clarifying the optimum dose and dosing regimen to maximize benefits and minimize side effects, determining the lowest effective dose, identifying possible requirements for concomitant therapies, specifying which types of acne are likely to respond, and assessing the effectiveness of spironolactone compared to standard therapies.

Interestingly, several acne guidelines and treatment recommendations include spironolactone based on consensus and/or expert opinion. However, some guidelines omit spironolactone or specifically deem it ineffective, not recommended, or inadequately supported by evidence. Notably, all guidelines, including those claiming to be evidence-based, have failed to identify the majority of studies included in this systematic review.

Although there were five relevant studies that, at the time of writing, were unobtainable (two of which were likely duplicate publications of included case series), we are confident that all the RCTs evaluating spironolactone for acne in women have been retrieved. No clinical trial evidence has been overlooked. Until higher-quality evidence becomes available, guideline developers will need to rely largely on recommendations based on expert experience or reached through consensus of expert panels.

### Antibiofilm agents for the treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis: A systematic narrative review [^117P7t9y]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Therapeutic agents were classified into seven groups based on their mechanisms of action. Antibiotics were investigated in approximately a quarter of the publications (n = 9). Other investigated agents included enzymes (n = 8), cationic peptides (n = 7), probiotics (n = 7), antiseptics (n = 5), and surfactants or their components (n = 2). Most studies (n = 28, 80%) investigated treatment efficacy, while the remaining 20% (n = 7) also evaluated safety.

Given the lack of standardization in measuring efficacy outcomes, these were broadly grouped into five categories: biofilm cell viability (n = 20), biofilm biomass (n = 15), direct growth inhibition (n = 14), biofilm morphology (n = 6), and molecular quantification (n = 3). Safety was measured in only seven studies and categorized into three mutually exclusive categories: vaginal epithelial cell changes (n = 4), tolerance of lactobacilli to therapeutics (n = 2), and adverse events and tolerability (human studies, n = 1).

Findings, including specific agents within each therapeutic class, are detailed. Seven preclinical studies examined the effect of antibiotics on preformed in vitro biofilms, focusing on agents such as amoxicillin, clindamycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, subtilisin A, and tobramycin. Earlier studies reported significant efficacy of two antibiotics against preformed single-species G vaginalis biofilms, including complete biofilm eradication with clindamycin and a 2-log reduction or complete biofilm eradication.

### Current treatment of bacterial vaginosis-limitations and need for innovation [^1166JtZJ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Practitioners and patients alike widely recognize the limitations of therapeutic approaches to the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV). Options remain extremely limited, and our inability to prevent the frequently, often relentless symptomatic recurrences of BV and to reduce serious sequelae, such as preterm delivery, remains an acknowledged but unresolved shortcoming. Our incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of this unique form of vaginal dysbiosis has been a significant impediment to developing optimal treatment and prevention approaches.

New drugs have not been forthcoming and are not likely to be available in the immediate future; hence, reliance on the optimal use of available agents has become essential as improvised, often unproven regimens are implemented. In this review, we will explore the limitations of currently recommended therapies, with a particular focus on the contribution of reinfection and pathogen persistence to BV recurrence, and the development of interventions that target these mechanisms. Ultimately, to achieve sustained cure and effectiveness against BV-associated sequelae, it is possible that we will need approaches that combine antimicrobials with biofilm-disrupting agents and partner treatments in those at risk of reinfection.

### Prevotella and gardnerella are associated with treatment failure following first-line antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis [^116zjz7h]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

ANCOM-BC was used to identify bacterial taxa that were differentially abundant pre- and posttreatment between recurrence and cure cases. Pretreatment, the mean abundance of Prevotella spp (representing Prevotella amplicon sequence variants that were not able to be classified at the species level) was significantly higher in women who experienced recurrence compared to those who were cured at 1 month posttreatment (log fold change [LFC] = 1.44, standard error [SE] = 0.56, P = 0.011).

Immediately posttreatment, the mean abundance of Gardnerella was increased in recurrence versus cure cases (LFC = 1.90, SE = 0.86, P = 0.028). Conversely, the mean abundance of both L. crispatus and Lactobacillus fornicalis was decreased in women who experienced recurrence compared to those who did not (L. crispatus LFC = −1.55, SE = 0.40, P = 0.0001; L. fornicalis LFC = −1.19, SE = 0.34, P = 0.0006). There was no significant difference in the abundance of L. iners between recurrence and cure cases at day 0 (LFC = 0.08, SE = 0.71, P > .05) or day 8 (LFC = −1.60, SE = 1.02, P > .05). ANCOM-BC findings were mostly consistent with findings from a second differential abundance analysis method. Supplementary Table 2 presents the prevalence and relative abundance of taxa identified as differentially abundant by ANCOM-BC. Of note, L. crispatus was present in low relative abundance both pretreatment and immediately posttreatment in most participants, except for 8 cure cases who had an L. crispatus relative abundance > 50% at day 8.

### Bacterial vaginosis: A practical review [^111aLKtC]. JAAPA (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on bacterial vaginosis:

- **Definition**: BV, previously referred to as Gardnerella vaginitis, is a disease resulting from the overgrowth of normal vaginal bacterial flora.

- **Pathophysiology**: BV is idiopathic; however, sexual transmission has been implicated. It is associated with fluctuations in vaginal microbiota, with a relative increase in Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Prevotella species, and Mobiluncus species, in addition to a decrease in lactobacilli.

- **Epidemiology**: In the US, about 7.4 million cases of BV occur yearly. In nonpregnant women with symptomatic vaginal discharge, the overall prevalence of BV is 24.4% based on Nugent's scoring system.

- **Disease course**: BV is characterized by milky and malodorous vaginal discharge, resulting in vulvovaginal discomfort and irritation. It has a strong association with preterm birth, first-trimester miscarriage in women undergoing IVF, chorioamnionitis, amniotic-fluid infection, endometritis after childbirth or abortion, and infections after hysterectomy.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: BV has a high recurrence rate of up to 50% within a year of treatment.
