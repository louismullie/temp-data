## Question

pathogenesis of CoA

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the pathogenesis of coarctation of the aorta. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and anatomic variants to anchor the discussion. Then, I should verify the two leading pathogenetic hypotheses and weigh their evidence. Next, I will examine genetic and developmental contributors, followed by the hemodynamic consequences that translate pathogenesis into phenotype. After that, I need to consider the paradox of persistent hypertension after repair and its mechanisms. Finally, I will integrate these elements into a unified model and outline clinical implications for diagnosis, surveillance, and management, ensuring each claim is supported by appropriate sources.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and its anatomy. Coarctation of the aorta is a congenital narrowing of the thoracic aorta, most commonly just distal to the left subclavian artery at the isthmus, often with a shelf-like lesion and frequently associated with a bicuspid aortic valve. It can be preductal or postductal relative to the ductus arteriosus, and the lesion may be discrete or involve arch hypoplasia, which frames how pathogenesis and hemodynamics will play out [^111Rfe1F] [^113zN4KN] [^112rbQm7].

> Now, I should review the two principal pathogenetic theories and be careful not to overstate either. The hemodynamic or flow hypothesis proposes that reduced antegrade flow across the fetal aortic isthmus — due to upstream left-sided obstructive lesions or altered cardiac output — impairs normal development of the isthmus, leading to hypoplasia and a posterior shelf; this is supported by fetal imaging correlates and by genetic variants that could plausibly reduce fetal cardiac output, such as MYH6 mutations, though I need to acknowledge that causality remains inferential in humans [^111Rfe1F] [^1168W6T1] [^111jX12j] [^113AzTbi]. The ectopic ductal tissue hypothesis posits that ductal smooth muscle extends into the adjacent aortic wall; with ductal constriction after birth, this tissue contracts and creates the characteristic shelf and luminal compromise, a mechanism consistent with the timing of neonatal presentation and with histologic observations of infolding and medial abnormalities at the isthmus [^111Rfe1F] [^114cWFFN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should integrate these models rather than choose one exclusively. Contemporary reviews emphasize that both mechanisms likely contribute in varying proportions across patients, with fetal flow dynamics shaping arch development and ectopic ductal tissue executing the final obstructive event after birth, which helps explain the spectrum from isolated shelf to long-segment hypoplasia and the clustering with other left-sided obstructive lesions [^111Rfe1F].

> Next, I should review genetic and developmental contributors and verify their strength of evidence. Familial aggregation and heritability of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction phenotypes, including CoA, point to shared developmental pathways; NOTCH1 variants are repeatedly implicated, and rare MYH6 variants have population-level associations in founder cohorts, plausibly reducing fetal cardiac output and isthmic flow, though I must note that most CoA is sporadic and no single gene explains most cases [^111cC3Uy] [^111jX12j] [^113AzTbi]. Let me also consider syndromic contexts: Turner syndrome carries a markedly increased CoA prevalence, reinforcing a developmental vulnerability of the aortic arch and isthmus, and reminding me to screen accordingly in clinical practice [^117Xg5Cv] [^111Q6hi7].

> I will now examine how the anatomic lesion translates into hemodynamic consequences, and I need to ensure I distinguish neonatal from older presentations. In neonates, ductal patency can mask symptoms until constriction occurs, precipitating acute afterload mismatch, left ventricular dysfunction, and shock from abrupt distal hypoperfusion; prostaglandin can restore lower-body perfusion even without fully reopening the ductus in some cases, underscoring the ductal tissue mechanism while also reminding me that flow is the immediate lifesaving target [^115zihWB] [^114cWFFN]. In older infants and children, chronic obstruction drives left ventricular hypertrophy, exercise intolerance, and collateral arterial development to bypass the stenosis, with the classic arm–leg blood pressure gradient emerging as a hallmark of hemodynamic significance [^111Rfe1F] [^113zN4KN].

> But wait, what if the coarctation is repaired — does pathophysiology end there? I should double-check the paradox of persistent hypertension. Even after anatomically successful repair, many patients have residual or recurrent hypertension, often exercise-induced, reflecting a combination of residual gradients, arch hypoplasia, aortic wall remodeling with increased stiffness, endothelial dysfunction, abnormal sympathetic tone, and baroreceptor resetting; these vascular abnormalities are detectable by wave reflection analysis and correlate with left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction, indicating that CoA is better viewed as a systemic vasculopathy rather than a purely focal lesion [^113zN4KN] [^113WZyuY] [^1125Kd1L] [^1155iAme] [^115x6RcH].

> Let me consider the broader arteriopathy concept and verify its clinical implications. CoA clusters with other aortic and cerebral vascular anomalies, including bicuspid aortic valve, ascending aortic dilation, and intracranial aneurysms, supporting a diffuse vascular developmental disorder rather than an isolated isthmic defect; contemporary pooled estimates suggest intracranial aneurysm prevalence around 3–4% in CoA, only modestly above the general population, and strongly linked to hypertension, so routine universal screening is likely low-yield outside high-risk phenotypes [^113zN4KN] [^116dFLSX] [^113PbBbS]. I should confirm that guidelines reflect this nuance, recommending individualized consideration of neurovascular imaging rather than blanket screening in all adults with CoA [^111Rmiba].

> I need to ensure the unified model I propose aligns with observed clinical trajectories. Pathogenesis begins with fetal flow limitation and/or ectopic ductal tissue, progresses to postnatal mechanical obstruction with acute and chronic hemodynamic load, and evolves into a persistent systemic vascular phenotype characterized by stiffness, endothelial dysfunction, and neurohormonal dysregulation. Clinically, this manifests as neonatal shock if duct-dependent, childhood hypertension with collaterals, and adult hypertension with premature cardiovascular events despite repair, which mandates lifelong surveillance and risk modification [^113zN4KN] [^113WZyuY] [^1138j2jf].

> Next, I should review diagnostic and surveillance implications and verify they match guideline standards. Echocardiography screens for CoA and associated lesions such as bicuspid aortic valve, while CMR or CTA define arch anatomy, gradients, and collaterals; adults require serial imaging every 3–5 years and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to unmask exercise-induced hypertension, and exercise testing can reveal occult hemodynamic burden even when resting gradients appear modest [^111yckV3] [^114hq5UH] [^111Rmiba] [^1138j2jf]. Hold on, I should verify thresholds for "significant" CoA: guidelines converge on a peak-to-peak catheter gradient above 20 mmHg, or above 10 mmHg with reduced ventricular function or large collaterals, with corroborating noninvasive arm–leg blood pressure difference or Doppler mean gradient, which operationalizes pathophysiologic severity for intervention decisions [^117QcECz] [^113FJ6CL].

> Finally, I should translate pathogenesis into management principles and make sure they are evidence-aligned. Definitive therapy entails surgical repair or catheter-based stenting for significant native or recurrent CoA with hypertension, while guideline-directed medical therapy targets persistent hypertension and vascular risk; even after repair, aggressive blood pressure control, lifestyle modification, and structured longitudinal follow-up are essential because the vascular phenotype persists and complications accrue over decades [^111KWELg] [^113Rotsd] [^113zN4KN]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that early repair eliminates long-term risk; I should correct that — despite timely intervention, excess cardiovascular morbidity remains, reinforcing the need for lifelong surveillance and risk factor modification grounded in the pathophysiology of systemic vascular dysfunction [^113WZyuY] [^1138j2jf].

Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) arises from **two main mechanisms**: reduced fetal flow at the aortic isthmus causing underdevelopment [^1168W6T1], and ectopic ductal tissue that constricts the aorta after birth [^111Rfe1F]. These mechanisms produce a **localized narrowing** — typically distal to the left subclavian artery — that increases afterload, causes left ventricular hypertrophy, and triggers collateral circulation [^113zN4KN]. Persistent hypertension after repair reflects residual arch abnormalities, endothelial dysfunction, and neurohormonal activation [^1125Kd1L]. CoA is also associated with bicuspid aortic valve and Turner syndrome, indicating a genetic component [^116FHqU9] [^117Xg5Cv].

---

## Embryological and developmental mechanisms

### Hemodynamic theory

The **reduced fetal flow** model proposes that decreased antegrade flow through the aortic isthmus during fetal development leads to underdevelopment of the isthmus and distal arch [^111Rfe1F]. The **branching theory** suggests that altered flow patterns make the distal arch functionally branch from the ductus arteriosus, causing posterior infolding and shelf formation after ductal closure [^1168W6T1].

---

### Ectopic ductal tissue theory

The **ductal tissue extension** model posits that ductal smooth muscle extends into the aortic wall; with ductal constriction after birth, this tissue contracts and narrows the aorta [^111Rfe1F]. The **histological evidence** shows that resected specimens demonstrate ductal-like tissue at the coarctation site, supporting this mechanism [^notfound].

---

## Anatomical and histopathological features

- **Location**: The narrowing is typically just distal to the left subclavian artery, at the aortic isthmus [^113zN4KN].

- **Morphology**: The lesion is often a discrete shelf or diaphragm, but can be a long segment with arch hypoplasia [^111urQaW].

- **Histopathology**: There is medial thickening, intimal proliferation, and fibrosis, with cystic medial necrosis in some cases [^115Ktu8C].

---

## Hemodynamic consequences

- **Increased afterload**: The obstruction increases left ventricular afterload, causing concentric hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction [^115x6RcH].

- **Collateral circulation**: Pressure-driven collaterals develop via intercostal, internal mammary, and epigastric arteries [^notfound].

- **Persistent hypertension**: After repair, hypertension persists due to residual arch abnormalities, endothelial dysfunction, and neurohormonal activation [^116HzrRv] [^1125Kd1L].

---

## Genetic and molecular factors

- **NOTCH1 mutations**: Associated with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, including CoA [^111cC3Uy].

- **MYH6 mutations**: Sarcomeric variants (e.g. p. Arg721Trp) have been linked to CoA, possibly via reduced fetal cardiac output [^113AzTbi].

- **Turner syndrome**: Strong association with CoA, indicating a genetic predisposition [^117Xg5Cv].

## Summary of pathogenesis

| **Mechanism** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Hemodynamic theory | Reduced fetal flow causes isthmic underdevelopment |
| Ectopic ductal tissue theory | Ductal tissue constricts the aorta after birth |
| Genetic factors | NOTCH1, MYH6, Turner syndrome |
| Hemodynamic consequences | Increased afterload, LVH, collaterals, persistent hypertension |

---

CoA results from **interplay between reduced fetal flow and ectopic ductal tissue**, producing isthmic narrowing with downstream hemodynamic effects and persistent hypertension after repair; genetic factors and associated lesions (e.g. bicuspid aortic valve) further modulate risk and expression [^113zN4KN].

### Obesity and elevated blood pressure following repair of coarctation of the aorta [^112NbWxJ]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether patients with coarctation of the aorta (COA) were more likely to develop obesity compared with the general population or others with isolated forms of congenital heart disease.

Study Design

We conducted a cross-sectional study of 160 patients who underwent COA repair at our institution between 1974 and 2009. Body mass index (BMI) measurements were obtained from the most recent clinic visit and at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years of age from retrospective chart review. BMI values were compared against established normal data to obtain age-sex matched z-scores. We also compared the rates of developing obesity over time in adults with COA vs 96 adults with other isolated forms of congenital heart disease, including aortic valve stenosis, pulmonary valve stenosis, or atrial septal defect.

Results

After age 5 years, patients with COA had significantly greater BMI z-scores compared with age-sex matched normal data (P < .001). The proportion of obesity in patients with COA significantly increased over time (P < .001). Adults with repaired COA developed obesity at a greater rate than those with either aortic valve stenosis (P = 0.004) or with pulmonary valve stenosis or atrial septal defect (P < .001).

Conclusions

There is a greater incidence of obesity that progressively increases with age in patients with repaired COA. Adults with repaired COA developed obesity at a greater rate than those with other isolated forms of congenital heart disease. Further prospective trials are needed to confirm our observations and to elucidate the potential mechanism relating COA to obesity.

Isolated coarctation scope and consensus context — For the purposes of this practice guideline, isolated coarctation refers to coarctation of the aorta that may have associated arch hypoplasia but without other congenital heart defects such as ventricular septal defects (VSDs) or other major anomalies, and although coarctation is commonly encountered, there is no consensus regarding the optimum management of isolated coarctation in neonates and infants; recommendations should be taken in the context of the individual patient as well as the expertise of a given surgeon and institution, and the authors recognize limitations regarding available data including the lack of randomized trials and inconsistent follow-up.

### Reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with coarctation requires systematic differentiation of impacts of mixed valvular disease on coarctation hemodynamics [^115Haxko]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Coarctation of the aorta (COA) is one of the most common congenital heart defects, accounting for 5% to 8% of all congenital heart defects, occurring in ≈3 out of 10 000 of live births.COA is often present in conjunction with other cardiac pathologies, mainly alongside mixed valvular diseases (MVDs). MVDs are classified as various combinations of aortic and mitral valvular pathologies occurring simultaneously. COA is commonly associated with the bicuspid aortic valve, because up to 85% of patients with COA suffer from both pathologies. Additionally, aortic stenosis (AS) and aortic regurgitation (AR) are commonly found alongside COA, occurring in 5% to 15% and 2% to 4% of cases, respectively. Furthermore, COA is frequently found alongside mitral valve diseases, presenting itself in 20% to 59% of all patients with mitral pathologies. The common mitral valve diseases found to coexist with COA include mitral stenosis (MS) and mitral regurgitation (MR), occurring in 3% and 2% to 5% of patients with COA, respectively. COA and MVDs have significant effects on the left ventricle (LV), and if not treated promptly, are likely to result in LV dysfunction, cardiac failure, and death.

### Advances in the treatment of neonatal coarctation of the aorta [^115bsUZJ]. Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is a potentially life-threatening congenital and obstructive anomaly of the distal aortic arch. After constriction of the ductus arteriosus, neonates may develop critical CoA in the isthmus area and present with severe left ventricular dysfunction or even cardiac failure. Low cardiac output and abdominal hypoperfusion (distal to the coarctation) may lead to metabolic derangements and clinical deterioration. Most neonates can be adequately stabilized with critical care support; however, patients who demonstrate treatment-resistant left ventricular dysfunction and end organ damage are often considered too unstable for primary surgical CoA repair. In this particular setting, transcatheter intervention is often regarded as more beneficial than prolonged intensive care. Specialized centers have proposed different approaches to critical CoA treatment. Nevertheless, individual therapy decisions are based on patient condition as well as the experience and expertise of the interdisciplinary team. This article focuses on isolated neonatal CoA (as opposed to CoA in complex congenital heart disease). Advances in neonatal diagnosis, critical care, transcatheter interventions, and surgical techniques have led to lower mortality and reintervention rates and have improved outcomes in neonates with critical CoA. Issues requiring further study include the optimal timing of definitive surgical CoA repair and the question how the severity of aortic obstruction and the choice of surgical technique affect long-term neurologic outcome.

### Use of cardiovascular computed tomography in the diagnosis and management of coarctation of the aorta [^111ehMuL]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Coarctation of the aorta is a common malformation accounting for 5% to 8% of all congenital heart defects. Although echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging are most frequently used in the diagnosis and management of coarctation of the aorta, the role of multidetector computed tomography in congenital heart defects has been expanding and its use has been increasing over the last few years. Multidetector computed tomography with its high spatial and temporal resolution, multiplanar reconstruction capabilities, and wide field of view is an excellent tool for the detection and characterization of coarctation of the aorta, and the identification of associated anomalies of the heart and pulmonary vasculature. It is particularly useful and indicated in patients with contraindications for cardiac magnetic resonance (eg, patients with aortic or coronary artery stents, pacemakers or implantable cardioverter defibrillators, and mechanical heart valves). Knowledge of the cardiac computed tomography appearance of coarctation of the aorta and associated abnormalities is critical for accurate diagnosis and management, which includes providing information to plan surgical or percutaneous therapy. We present various forms of coarctation of the aorta on cardiac computed tomography.

### Mind the brain: stroke risk in young adults with coarctation of the aorta [^116NUFB8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The authors also found an increased proportion of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) among patients with stroke with CoA. The median age of 23 years at which SAH occurred was even younger than that at which ischemic stroke occurred in such patients, and an astounding 35 years younger than in those without CoA. Intracranial aneurysms account for the vast majority of SAHs and have known associations with CoA. 9 Indeed, in this study, there was an increased frequency of unruptured aneurysms in patients with CoA who presented with stroke (4% versus 2%). Given the high mortality rates of up to 51% associated with SAH, 10 this study highlights the importance of considering intracranial aneurysms in patients with CoA.

Two hypothesized mechanisms have been proposed to explain the development of intracranial aneurysms in patients with CoA: (1) developmental abnormalities of the arterial wall and (2) pathologic changes as a result of mechanical forces attributable to hypertension. 11 The former hypothesis could mean that these aneurysms are different in nature and, thus, may have implications in terms of rupture risk and treatment, whereas the latter hypothesis would suggest that they occur because of the earlier development of risk factors, such as hypertension. One recent study found no intracranial aneurysms in a group of patients who all underwent CoA repair early in life and had magnetic resonance angiographic screening for intracranial aneurysms in adolescence. 12 Although such findings call the developmental hypothesis into question, it remains a possibility given that in the present study there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of other modifiable risk factors.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for coarctation of aorta, more specifically with respect to indications for screening (hypertension), AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASH/ASPC/NMA/PCNA 2018 guidelines recommend to obtain echocardiography to screen for CoA in patients with hypertension meeting any of the following criteria:

- young patient with hypertension (< 30 years of age)

- BP higher in upper extremities than in lower extremities

- absent femoral pulses

- continuous murmur over patient's back, chest, or abdominal bruit

- left thoracotomy scar (postoperative).

### Risk factors for coarctation of the aorta on prenatal ultrasound: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111MdDVA]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Prenatal diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is still challenging and affected by high rates of false-positive diagnoses. The aim of this study was to ascertain the strength of association and to quantify the diagnostic accuracy of different ultrasound signs in predicting CoA prenatally.

Methods

Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases were searched. Random-effects and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic model meta-analyses were used to analyze the data.

Results

Seven hundred ninety-four articles were identified, and 12 (922 fetuses at risk for CoA) articles were included. Mean mitral valve diameter z score was lower (P < 0.001) and the mean tricuspid valve diameter z score was higher in fetuses with CoA than in those without CoA (P = 0.01). Mean aortic valve diameter z score was lower in fetuses with CoA than in healthy fetuses (P ≤ 0.001), but the ascending aorta diameter, expressed as z score or millimeters, was similar between groups (P = 0.07 and 0.47, respectively). Mean aortic isthmus diameter z scores measured either in sagittal (P = 0.02) or in 3-vessel trachea view (P < 0.001) were lower in fetuses with CoA. Conversely, the mean pulmonary artery diameter z score, the right/left ventricular and pulmonary artery/ascending aorta diameter ratios were higher (P < 0.001, P = 0.02, and P = 0.02, respectively) in fetuses with CoA in comparison with controls, although aortic isthmus/arterial duct diameter ratio was lower in fetuses with CoA than in those without CoA (P < 0.001). The presence of coarctation shelf and aortic arch hypoplasia were more common in fetuses with CoA than in controls (odds ratio, 26.0; 95% confidence interval, 4.42–153; P < 0.001 and odds ratio, 38.2; 95% confidence interval, 3.01–486; P = 0.005), whereas persistent left superior vena cava (P = 0.85), ventricular septal defect (P = 0.12), and bicuspid aortic valve (P = 0.14) did not carry an increased risk for this anomaly. Multiparametric diagnostic models integrating different ultrasound signs for the detection of CoA were associated with an increased detection rate.

Conclusions

The detection rate of CoA may improve when a multiple-criteria prediction model is adopted. Further large multicenter studies sharing the same imaging protocols are needed to develop objective models for risk assessment in these fetuses.

### Interventions in adults with repaired coarctation of the aorta [^116xsQog]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Coarctation of the aorta coexists with other cardiac anomalies and has long‐term complications, including recoarctation, which may require intervention after the primary coarctation repair. This study aims to clarify the prevalence of and risk factors for interventions related to the coarctation complex as well as late mortality in a large contemporary patient population.

Methods and Results

The Swedish National Register of Congenital Heart Disease was used, which comprised 683 adults with repaired coarctation of the aorta. Analysis was performed on freedom from intervention thereafter at the coarctation site, aortic valve, left ventricular outflow tract, or ascending aorta. One hundred ninety‐six (29%) patients had at least 1 of these interventions. Estimated freedom from either of these interventions was 60% after 50 years. The risk of undergoing such an intervention was higher among men (hazard ratio, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.2–2.2]). Estimated freedom from another intervention at the coarctation site was 75% after 50 years. In women, there was an increase in interventions at the coarctation site after 45 years. Patients who underwent one of the previously mentioned interventions after the primary coarctation repair had poorer left ventricular function. Eighteen patients (3%) died during follow‐up in the register. The standardized mortality ratio was 2.9 (95% CI, 1.7–4.3).

Conclusions

Interventions are common after coarctation repair. The risk for and time of interventions are affected by sex. Our results have implications for planning follow‐up and giving appropriate medical advice to the growing population of adults with repaired coarctation of the aorta.

### Hypertension at diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta as a risk factor for recoarctation [^1137G7u6]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is a narrowing of the aorta that affects 5–8% of congenital heart defects. Treatment options include surgical repair or transcatheter management with endovascular stenting or balloon dilatation. Late complications after operative repair include systemic hypertension, aortic valve abnormalities, aortic aneurysm, and recoarctation. This study examines the association between the presence of hypertension at the diagnosis of CoA and recoarctation.

Methods

This retrospective study analyzed medical records of patients at Soroka University Medical Center who underwent treatment for CoA between 1978 and 2021. The study included 128 patients diagnosed with CoA and who underwent repair; 9 were excluded, leaving 119 patients for analysis.

Results

Of the 119 patients, 28 developed recoarctation within 15 years of initial repair. Patients with hypertension at initial diagnosis were more likely to develop recoarctation, adjusted to sex and ethnicity. Other patient characteristics were not significantly associated with recoarctation.

Conclusions

Hypertension at the time of initial CoA diagnosis is a risk factor for the development of recoarctation within 15 years of initial repair. Close monitoring and management of blood pressure may be important for patients with CoA. Future research should investigate whether hypertension control can reduce recoarctation risk in this population.

Impact

Previous studies focus on post-repair hypertension in CoA. Limited research on hypertension during CoA diagnosis. Knowledge gap on its impact on recoarctation risk. Hypertension at CoA diagnosis may predict recoarctation. Enables tailored monitoring and timely intervention.

Coarctation of the aorta — clinical features and longitudinal imaging follow-up note that CoA typically occurs near the ductal remnant and left subclavian artery, hypertension is the most common sequela of CoA whether repaired or unrepaired, and bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is commonly associated and present in more than half of CoA patients; complications of repair include recoarctation, aneurysm, pseudoaneurysm, and dissection, with longterm follow-up after successful surgical intervention revealing that 11% of patients may require reintervention for restenosis; after successful transcatheter intervention with stenting or balloon angioplasty, follow-up CMR or CTA imaging is recommended to evaluate for long-term complications, and unoperated adults almost invariably present with systemic arterial hypertension measured in the upper extremities with physical examination showing a delay or decrease in amplitude of the femoral pulse.

### Bicuspid aortic valve: different clinical profiles for subjects with versus without repaired aortic coarctation [^114xWjFp]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital heart abnormality in adults, and it is well recognised that aortic coarctation (CoA) coexists in a small but significant proportion of these patients. Despite this established link, however, the impact of past CoA repair on the natural history of BAV disease is not well described. Before the advent of repair techniques, aortic dissection accounted for 19% of deaths in patients with coarctation, which was amplified when BAV was also present. In the current era of effective CoA repair, however, few studies have specifically sought to investigate the impact of repaired CoA on BAV, and thus far, limited investigation of this important clinical question has led to conflicting results. We, therefore, aimed to identify any differences between patients with BAV alone, and those with BAV and coarctation, in order to better understand what clinical bearing coexistent coarctation may have on BAV disease.

Coarctation of the aorta — therapeutic recommendations state that surgical repair or catheter-based stenting is recommended for adults with hypertension and significant native or recurrent coarctation of the aorta; guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) is recommended for treatment of hypertension in patients with coarctation of the aorta; and balloon angioplasty for adults with native and recurrent coarctation of the aorta may be considered if stent placement is not feasible and surgical intervention is not an option.

Circulation (2008). Medium credibility.

Coarctation of the aorta — pregnancy and infective endocarditis prophylaxis: Pregnancy in coarctation of the aorta continues to be a source of concern, but major cardiovascular complications are infrequent, and an assessment of the hemodynamic status, severity of coarctation, and associated lesions, particularly BAV, AS, or a significantly dilated root, should be undertaken before pregnancy for proper planning and advice; the potential for aortic dissection remains, although it is quite small unless the aorta is dilated significantly. Patients with uncomplicated native coarctation or uncomplicated, recurrent coarctation that is successfully repaired do not require endocarditis prophylaxis unless there is a prior history of endocarditis or a conduit has been inserted or if surgical repair or stenting has been performed less than 6 months previously.

Significant effort has been put into the optimization of the antenatal diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta (CoA). However, although left-sided cardiac lesions are known to cluster, the necessity to intervene postnatally for other left-sided cardiac lesions has not been reported in a cohort of fetuses with suspected CoA. We report a study of all 89 fetuses with antenatally suspected and postnatally confirmed diagnosis of CoA who underwent CoA repair as the primary procedure at a single tertiary congenital heart disease center over 10 years (January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2019). Almost 1 in 5 patients (18%) had to undergo surgery and/or transcatheter intervention on additional left-sided cardiac lesions (14%) and/or reintervention on the aortic arch (12%) during follow-up to median age of 2.85 years. Freedom from intervention at 5 years was 78% (95% confidence interval [CI] 67 to 88%) if reintervention on CoA was excluded, and 72% (95% CI 60 to 82%) if this was included. Five-year survival was 95% (95% CI 90 to 100%). Furthermore, 20% of affected infants had genetic (10%) and/or extracardiac (16%) abnormalities. Our study highlights the need for comprehensive antenatal counseling, including the prognosis of primary repair of CoA and the potential development of additional left-sided cardiac lesions, which may be difficult to diagnose prenatally even in expert hands or impossible to diagnose because of the physiology of the fetal circulation.

### Hypertension in coarctation of the aorta: challenges in diagnosis in children [^114K5VeG]. Pediatric Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Evidence indicates that patients with coarctation of the aorta (COA) suffer from increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in later life despite successful repair of COA in childhood. Systolic arterial hypertension is common, presenting in up to one-third of patients, and is regarded as the main driver of premature cardiovascular events in this group of patients. In this review, we discuss the prevalence and pathophysiology of hypertension in children following successful COA repair with no residual arch obstruction. The challenges in accurate blood pressure assessment at this early phase are considered and non-invasive measures of central blood pressure are discussed. Although the pathways for investigations in adults are well defined, we highlight the need to address the issues of cardiovascular surveillance in children and describe techniques which can provide complementary information for cardiovascular assessment in this group of patients such that timely treatment can occur.

### Impact of treatment modality on vascular function in coarctation of the aorta: the LOVE-COARCT study [^1125Kd1L]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Current surgical and percutaneous techniques for treatment of coarctation of the aorta (CoA) are equally effective at eliminating narrowing of the aortic isthmus, except in infants and young children, in whom surgery is preferred. 1 However, despite optimal anatomical results, late morbidity is significant with high rates of systemic hypertension. 1 Secondary abnormalities, including increased left ventricular (LV) mass 2, 3, 4, 5 and impaired systolic 3, 5 and diastolic function, 6 have also been reported. Furthermore, treated patients have reduced life expectancy, attributed to premature cardiovascular complications and stroke. 7, 8, 9 Vascular dysfunction is common after CoA treatment and may contribute to these adverse outcomes. 10, 11, 12 Patients with successfully treated CoA have been reported to have stiffer large arteries, 3, 4, 5, 11 impaired endothelial function, 2, 10, 13, 14 and imbalances in biochemical and molecular pathways associated with vascular function. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 Although vascular dysfunction is driven by important pretreatment factors, including abnormalities in the renin‐angiotensin system 19 and baroreceptor function, 20 several treatment‐related factors have been associated with worse vascular dysfunction, such as older age at treatment, 3, 10, 16 longer length of follow‐up, and residual narrowing at the site of CoA repair. 2

### Diagnosis, imaging and clinical management of aortic coarctation [^112dNsmq]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is a well-known congenital heart disease (CHD), which is often associated with several other cardiac and vascular anomalies, such as bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus and aortic arch hypoplasia. Despite echocardiographic screening, prenatal diagnosis of C o A remains difficult. Most patients with CoA present in infancy with absent, delayed or reduced femoral pulses, a supine arm-leg blood pressure gradient (> 20mm Hg), or a murmur due to rapid blood flow across the CoA or associated lesions (BAV). Transthoracic echocardiography is the primary imaging modality for suspected CoA. However, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred advanced imaging modality for non-invasive diagnosis and follow-up of CoA. Adequate and timely diagnosis of CoA is crucial for good prognosis, as early treatment is associated with lower risks of long-term morbidity and mortality. Numerous surgical and transcatheter treatment strategies have been reported for CoA. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice in neonates, infants and young children. In older children (> 25kg) and adults, transcatheter treatment is the treatment of choice. In the current era, patients with CoA continue to have a reduced life expectancy and an increased risk of cardiovascular sequelae later in life, despite adequate relief of the aortic stenosis. Intensive and adequate follow-up of the left ventricular function, valvular function, blood pressure and the anatomy of the heart and the aorta are, therefore, critical in the management of CoA. This review provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art clinical diagnosis, diagnostic imaging algori thms, treatment and follow-up of patients with CoA.

### Background information: pathogenesis… [^112tktAU]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Background Information: Pathogenesis Guidelines for the Prevention of Intravascular Catheter-Related Infections There are four recognized routes for contamination of catheters:

- migration of skin organisms at the insertion site into the cutaneous catheter tract and along the surface of the catheter with colonization of the catheter tip; this is the most common route of infection for short-term catheters;
- direct contamination of the catheter or catheter hub by contact with hands or contaminated fluids or devices;. On the other hand, biofilm formation by C. albicans occurs more readily on silicone elastomer catheter surfaces than polyurethane catheters. Modification of the biomaterial surface properties has been shown to influence the ability of C. albicans to form biofilm.

Additionally, certain catheter materials are more thrombogenic than others, a characteristic that also might predispose to catheter colonization and infection. This association has led to emphasis on preventing catheter-related thrombus as an additional mechanism for reducing CRBSI. The adherence properties of a given microorganism in relationship to host factors are also important in the pathogenesis of CRBSI. For example. S. aureus can adhere to host proteins commonly present on catheters by expressing clumping factors that bind to the protein adhesins. Furthermore, adherence is enhanced through the production by microbial organisms, such as coagulase negative staphylococci, S.

aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida species of an extracellular polymeric substance consisting mostly of an exopolysaccharide that forms a microbial biofilm layer. Such a biofilm potentiates the pathogenicity of various microbes by allowing them to withstand host defense mechanisms or by making them less susceptible to antimicrobial agents.

### Coarctation of the aorta: modern paradigms across the lifespan [^113WZyuY]. Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

While coarctation of the aorta varies greatly in both severity and age at presentation, all patients are at increased risk of hypertension both before and after repair. Despite advances in knowledge about genetic etiologies, pathophysiologic mechanisms, and optimal repair strategies, patients with repaired coarctation of the aorta remain at increased risk of acquired cardiovascular disease. The aims of this review are to describe the management of coarctation of the aorta at all ages before and after repair, highlight pathophysiologic mechanisms of hypertension, and review long-term follow-up considerations.

### Hypertension at diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta as a risk factor for recoarctation [^116HzrRv]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

CoA is a complex cardiovascular condition that requires prompt diagnosis and appropriate management. Previous studies have provided valuable insights into the association between hypertension after CoA repair and clinical outcomes in these patients.

It is assumed that hypertension in patients with CoA likely stems from multiple biological mechanisms, such as innate morphological abnormalities of the aortic wall, residual pressure gradients following repair, and dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin and baroreceptor systems. Residual narrowing or hypoplasia of the aortic arch post-repair can cause regional hypertension in the arch and its branches, while recoarctation at previously repaired sites further elevates BP in pre-coarctation arterial segments. Evidence suggests that even after successful stenting of coarctation, BP often fails to normalize. Furthermore, renal hypoperfusion and ischemia may activate the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, contributing to persistent hypertension even after CoA repair. Longstanding hypertension may also reset the carotid and aortic baroreceptors to higher pressure thresholds, impairing BP regulation in these patients.

These patients suffer from increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, which is mostly attributed to the increased prevalence of hypertension contributing to long-term complications in CoA patients.

However, there remained a need to further explore the clinical characteristics of patients with CoA at the time of diagnosis and their impact on long-term outcomes.

In this study, we aimed to fill this knowledge gap and found that hypertension during the diagnosis of CoA is a significant risk factor for poor clinical outcomes in these patients, with increased rates of recoarctation (Fig. 1).

The results of our study may have important implications for the management of patients with CoA. This is in line with previous research that indicated a link between CoA and the development of IA, which may be due to a combination of vascular developmental abnormalities and HTN as a risk factor.

### Hypertension at diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta as a risk factor for recoarctation [^111urQaW]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) refers to the narrowing or stenosis of the aorta, typically at the aortic isthmus of the proximal thoracic aorta, and may be discrete or a long segment. This narrowing is characterized by localized medial thickening and infolding of the vascular tissue.

The prevalence of CoA varies between 5% and 8% of all congenital heart defects. Most cases of CoA are sporadic. CoA typically occurs as an isolated cardiac abnormality. However, patients presenting in infancy are more likely to have associated intracardiac abnormalities.

Most patients present in infancy with shock and heart failure following closure of the ductus arteriosus, on routine screening due to absence of the femoral arterial pulse, or with mild arterial hypertension and show improvement with opening of the ductus arteriosus after initiation of prostaglandin infusion.

Hypertension in neonates is normally seen in 0.2–3% of all infants, and because of the low prevalence in otherwise healthy term infants routine blood pressure (BP) determination is not recommended in this age bracket. Common causes of hypertension in neonates include thromboembolic events and congenital problems such as structural renal malformations, renovascular disease, and CoA. Hypertension in patients with CoA is likely to be multifactorial and related to a combination of innate abnormalities of the aortic wall and regulatory alterations of renin-angiotensin and baroreceptor systems.

Several surgical and percutaneous treatment techniques for CoA are available including end-to-end resection, patch repair, tube grafts, subclavian flap arterioplasty, balloon dilation, and stenting. The choice of surgical vs endovascular repair is based on diverse factors such as aortic arch anatomy, associated cardiac anomalies, patient preference, and institutional expertise.

### Aortic coarctation [^111Rfe1F]. Cardiology Clinics (2020). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on coarctation of aorta:

- **Definition**: CoA is a congenital heart defect characterized by a discrete narrowing of the thoracic aorta, typically distal to the left subclavian artery.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathogenesis of coarctation is not fully understood, but two main theories exist. The hemodynamic hypothesis suggests that reduced in utero blood flow across the aortic isthmus leads to abnormal aortic development. The ectopic ductal tissue hypothesis proposes that ductal tissue extends into the aorta, thickening its walls, and as the ductus arteriosus closes, this creates the coarctation. Coarctation of the aorta results in elevated afterload on the left ventricle, leading to LVH and hypertension, and may induce the development of collateral circulation.
- **Epidemiology**: CoA is the sixth most common congenital heart disease, occurring in up to 1 in 3,000 to 4,000 live births.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for coarctation of the aorta include genetic conditions such as Turner's syndrome, bicuspid aortic valve, elongation of the transverse aorta, and hypertension.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, CoA is often asymptomatic, but can present with severe hypertension leading to headache, epistaxis, HF and/or aortic dissection. Other symptoms may include exertional intolerance, dizziness, lower extremity claudication, abdominal angina and ICH. CoA can be complicated by the development of aortic aneurysms, particularly in the ascending aorta.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of CoA largely depends on the timing of diagnosis and intervention. Early detection and intervention, such as open or endovascular repair, can lead to good outcomes, including better BP control. The 15-year survival rate after CoA repair in patients aged < 21 years is reported to be 92%.

### A rare missense mutation in MYH6 associates with non-syndromic coarctation of the aorta [^113AzTbi]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Through GWAS based on variants identified through WGS, we found a rare missense variant in the sarcomere gene MYH6 that has a strong effect on the risk of CoA in the Icelandic population and explains a substantial fraction of CoA in Icelanders. The same mutation also associates with other CHDs, in particular BAV. It has a widespread effect on cardiac electrical function and associates strongly with atrial arrhythmias, both SSS and AF. This is the first mutation shown to associate with non-familial or sporadic form of CoA at a population level. The p. Arg721Trp mutation appears to be absent from other populations or if present, at a very low frequency. The Icelandic population is a founder population in that a small number of ancestors account for a relatively large proportion of genetic diversity in the current population. Hence, sequence variants that are very rare in more outbred populations, like p. Arg721Trp, may thus be more frequent in Icelanders.

Myosin is a major component of the sarcomere, the building block of the contractile system of cardiac muscle. Myosin is an ATPase cellular motor protein composed of two heavy chains and two pairs of light chains. The two heavy chains are αMHC and beta myosin heavy chain (βMHC) encoded by MYH6 and MYH7, respectively. Both αMHC and βMHC are expressed throughout the heart during embryonic cardiogenesis and βMHC continues to do so in the adult heart whereas αMHC expression becomes restricted to the atrium. Expression of MYH6 has not been detected in the aorta.

The pathogenesis of CoA is not well understood. One of the main models of CoA pathogenesis, the haemodynamic theory, maintains that cardiac lesions resulting in decreased left ventricular outflow promote development of CoA by reducing blood flow through the Foetal aorta. The p. Arg721Trp mutation could predispose to CoA by reducing blood flow through the Foetal aorta because of diminished contraction of the developing heart. This hypothesis is supported by overexpression studies in rat cardiomyocytes showing that the p. Arg721Trp mutation impairs sarcomeric structureand by our ECG data demonstrating widespread effect of p. Arg721Trp on cardiac electrical function, including in the ventricles. Our hypothesis is compatible with the fact that MYH6 is expressed in the ventricles during the development of the heart but not in the aorta.

### 2022 ACC / AHA guideline for the diagnosis and management of aortic disease: a report of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113zN4KN]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

ACC/AHA 2022 aortic disease — Coarctation of the aorta synopsis: CoA may have many anatomic variants and occurs most commonly at the level of the ductus arteriosus and distal to the left subclavian artery. Echocardiogram is indicated in the evaluation of patients with CoA because a BAV coexists in at least 50% of cases, and CoA may associate with complex congenital heart disease. Upper extremity hypertension and lower extremity hypoperfusion are the hallmarks of CoA. Intracranial aneurysms may occur in adults with CoA. Ascending aortic aneurysms may occur in those with BAV, and aneurysms may be present in the distal arch and descending aorta. Untreated CoA may be complicated by aortic dissection, heart failure, ruptured cerebral aneurysm, or complications from hypertension. Repair of CoA is performed by endovascular, open surgical, and hybrid procedures, depending on patient-specific and anatomic features. In patients with previous procedures, late complications may include recurrent stenosis, aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm formation, rupture, and persistent hypertension. Hypertension is common after CoA repair, especially during exercise, and ambulatory monitoring and exercise testing may be useful in diagnosis and management. Lifelong clinical and imaging follow-up is important to evaluate for hypertension, recurrent coarctation, and aortic wall abnormalities after repair.

### Effectiveness of prostaglandin E1 in relieving obstruction in coarctation of the aorta without opening the ductus arteriosus [^114cWFFN]. Pediatric Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

The two main theories regarding the pathogenesis of coarctation of the aorta are the Skodaic hypothesis of ductal tissue constricting the aorta at the level of the insertion of the ductus arteriosus and the flow theory of decreased ascending aortic blood flow in the fetus, which results in associated isthmic narrowing and a localized shelf. To document that ectopic ductal tissue constriction can cause coarctation of the aorta in the absence of a patent ductus arteriosus, we report three cases of infants presenting with critical coarctation who responded to prostaglandin E1 infusion without opening the ductus arteriosus.

### Mind the brain: stroke risk in young adults with coarctation of the aorta [^113CsJo3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Early Risk of Stroke in Patients With CoA

Stroke is among the 10 leading causes of death in all adult age groups, but the incidence of stroke increases dramatically with age. 7 Even more important is the substantial neurologic morbidity that frequently accompanies a stroke. This study found that stroke occurred at a significantly earlier age in individuals with a history of CoA. In fact, 75% of strokes occurred in those < 64 years and, thus, in patients who are likely still active in the workforce. The striking findings about the age at which stroke occurs in this population raise several important questions that must be addressed to develop preventive strategies to reduce neurologic morbidity in this population.

The earlier onset of stroke in this population begs the question of cause. Presumably, hypertension would be a primary risk factor. Although hypertension was present within the majority of all patients with stroke, patients with coarctation may be hypertensive at earlier ages and for longer periods of time. Alternatively, arteriopathies attributable to atherosclerosis or other underlying vascular abnormalities may play a role in stroke pathogenesis. Typically, strokes are classified according to the TOAST (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) criteria: small vessel, large vessel, cardioembolism, other, or unknown. 8 Future studies classifying ischemic stroke according to TOAST criteria will be helpful in determining which mechanisms are most responsible in patients with CoA.

### The variant associations of aortic isthmic coarctation [^114UgfS5]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

The term "coarctation" necessarily calls attention to a specific morphologic abnormality of the aortic isthmus. However, in this report, the author seeks to dispel the simplistic notion that coarctation is best characterized by isthmic obstruction, which is only 1 of an assemblage of abnormalities that include the proximal paracoarctation aorta, the distal paracoarctation aorta, the ascending aorta, the transverse aorta, the coronary arteries, the conduit arteries (radial, brachial, and carotid), the retinal vascular bed, dissecting aneurysms, cerebral aneurysms, vascular rings, systemic hypertension, and a decrease in left ventricular interpapillary muscle distance. Some of these abnormalities are secondary to the coarctation, such as collateral arteries and dissecting aneurysms. Others frequently or invariably coexist but are not secondary, such as bicuspid aortic valve and aneurysm of the circle of Willis. Still other abnormalities are seemingly contradictory, such as aneurysmal dilatation of the low-pressure distal paracoarctation aorta, while the high-pressure proximal segment does not dilate significantly. In conclusion, coarctation should be regarded as an assemblage of cardiovascular abnormalities rather than as isolated obstruction of the aortic isthmus.

Perspectives

Understanding the vascular abnormalities in patients with CoA is important if we wish to modify the cardiovascular risk and excess mortality in this population. Conventional clinical assessment using brachial blood pressure and anatomic imaging may fail to identify patients with vascular dysfunction, thereby leading to inappropriate undertreatment. Future therapeutic interventions should be targeted to the vascular abnormalities, which occur in this population.

The prevalence of IAs in this population has decreased over time and may be similar to the general population in the modern era. Based on currently available literature, universal screening of patients with CoA with angiographic imaging is likely of low value.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Further studies are warranted to understand the modern prevalence of and RFs associated with IAs in patients with CoA.

Coarctation of the aorta — therapeutic recommendations prioritize definitive repair and blood pressure control. Surgical repair or catheter-based stenting is recommended for adults with hypertension and significant native or recurrent coarctation of the aorta. GDMT is recommended for treatment of hypertension in patients with coarctation of the aorta. Balloon angioplasty for adults with native and recurrent coarctation of the aorta may be considered if stent placement is not feasible and surgical intervention is not an option.

### Prognostic value of the HFpEF score in Adults with repaired coarctation of Aorta [^115AFSk9]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Coarctation of aorta (COA) is characterized by chronic left ventricular (LV) pressure overload resulting from aortic isthmus stenosis, aortic arch hypoplasia, systemic hypertension due to increased aortic stiffness, and associated LV outflow tract lesions such as valvular and subvalvular aortic stenosis. Chronic LV pressure overload leads to LV remodeling, and overtime, this results in LV hypertrophy and stiffness, impaired LV compliance, left atrial (LA) remodeling, as well as atrial fibrillation and heart failure. Surgical and transcatheter interventions are effective for relieving LV pressure overload and preventing progressive LV remodeling and can sometime lead to LV reverse remodeling if performed prior to the onset of irreversible LV dysfunction. However, determining the optimal time for such an intervention is challenging because of the complex interaction between multiple hemodynamic factors and differences in LV adaptation to them.

In acquired heart disease, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for half of all heart failure-related morbidities and mortality globally, and hence, it is a critical public health problem. In spite of significant differences in the etiology and demographic characteristics between patients with HFpEF and those with COA, both disease conditions share similar hemodynamic characteristics such as abnormal aortic stiffness and hypertension, LV hypertrophy, impaired LV compliance and LA remodeling, and high prevalence of atrial fibrillation and symptomatic heart failure.,

Reddy et alproposed the H 2 FPEF score as a noninvasive clinical tool for differentiating between patients with HFpEF from those with noncardiac dyspnea, which in turn decreased the number of patients referred for cardiac catheterization. Recent studies have shown that the H 2 FPEF score can also be used for prognostication in the outpatient clinic to identify patients at risk of heart failure hospitalization and for prognostication in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement. However, the prognostic role of the H 2 FPEF score has not been assessed in adults with congenital heart disease. Considering the hemodynamic similarities between COA and HFpEF (aortic stiffness and hypertension, LV hypertrophy and stiffness, impaired LV compliance and LA remodeling, as well as higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation and symptomatic heart failure), we hypothesized that the H 2 FPEF score would be associated with cardiovascular events in this population. The purpose of this study was, therefore, to assess the prognostic role of the H 2 FPEF score in adults with repaired COA.

### Coarctation of the aorta: prenatal assessment, postnatal management and neonatal outcomes [^115zihWB]. Seminars in Perinatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Coarctation of the aorta (Coa) is a potentially life threatening diagnosis. It occurs in 0.3 per 1000 live births and accounts for 6–8% of all infants with congenital heart defects. Neonates with severe Coa may be completely asymptomatic at birth, as the ductus arteriosus can provide flow to the lower body. Those who are not diagnosed prenatally may be diagnosed only after constriction of the ductus arteriosus, when they present in cardiogenic shock. This group has a higher risk for mortality and morbidity relative to those diagnosed prenatally. Despite the increasing practice of universal pulse oximetry screening, many cases with significant coarctation of the aorta still go undiagnosed in the newborn period. In this article, we present the pathophysiology, diagnosis, presentation, treatment and outcomes of Coa.

### Prevalence of intracranial aneurysms in patients with coarctation of the aorta: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113PbBbS]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our results reveal a pooled estimated prevalence of IAs in patients with CoA to be approximately 3.8%, which is marginally higher than that reported in the general population (3.2%). However, the meta-analysis did suffer from significant statistical heterogeneity. There was an observed downward trend over time in the prevalence of IAs among the individual studies included which is likely multifactorial in etiology and suggests that there are modifiable RFs in the development of IAs in this population. Routine screening of asymptomatic patients with CoA for IA is likely of low-value. However, it may be reasonable to screen patients with associated risks including older age, and HTN. This area of study would benefit from further prospective studies evaluating the prevalence of IAs in adults with CoA to further the discussion on whether these patients should be screened for IAs.

### Coronary artery disease in adults with coarctation of aorta: incidence, risk factors, and outcomes [^117FtZwR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Background Premature coronary artery disease (CAD) is common in patients with coarctation of aorta (COA), but there are limited data about any direct relationship (or lack thereof) between COA and CAD. We hypothesized that atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk factors, rather than COA diagnosis, was the primary determinant of CAD occurrence in patients with COA. Methods and Results This is a retrospective study of 654 COA patients and a control group of 876 patients with valvular pulmonic stenosis and tetralogy of Fallot to determine prevalence and independent risk factors for CAD. There was no evidence of a difference in the unadjusted CAD prevalence between the COA and control groups (7.8% versus 6.3%, P = 0.247), but premature CAD was more common in COA patients (4.4% versus 1.8%, P = 0.002). In the analysis of a propensity-matched cohort of 126 COA and 126 control patients, there was no evidence of a difference in overall CAD prevalence (6.3% versus 5.6% versus P = 0.742) and premature CAD prevalence (4.8% versus 3.2%, P = 0.518). The multivariable risk factors for CAD were hypertension (odds ratio [OR] 2.14; 95% CI 1.36–3.38), hyperlipidemia (OR 3.33; 95% CI 2.02–5.47), diabetes mellitus (OR 1.98; 95% CI 1.31–3.61), male sex (OR 2.05; 95% CI 1.33–3.17), and older age per year (OR 1.06; 95% CI 1.04–1.07). Conclusions After adjusting for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk factors, we did not find evidence of a difference in CAD risk between the patients with COA and other patients with congenital heart disease.

### EACTS / STS guidelines for diagnosing and treating acute and chronic syndromes of the aortic organ [^112rbQm7]. European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Coarctation of the aorta — epidemiology, forms, and presentation: Coarctation of the aorta occurs in approximately 1 out of 2900 live births with a 4/1 male-to-female ratio, is the seventh most common congenital heart defect, and is frequently associated with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), aortic arch hypoplasia, mitral valve abnormalities, Shone complex, patent ductus arteriosus and atrial or ventricular septal defects. It is classified into 2 forms relative to the ductus arteriosus (preductal and post-ductal). In young adults, the most common presentation is upper extremity hypertension, and the differential systemic blood pressure between upper and lower extremities can often exceed 20 mmHg.

### Complications of coarctation repair [^116V2zwr]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery: Pediatric Cardiac Surgery Annual (2002). Low credibility.

Surgery's role in the treatment of coarctation has been established, and the benefit to life expectancy and quality of life is undeniable. Three postaortic coarctation repair complications are discussed, with review of existing literature: recurrent or residual aortic coarctation, postrepair aneurysm formation, and spinal cord ischemia. Incidence, potential causative factors, and outcome of surgical or transcatheter treatment for recurrent and residual aortic coarctation are reviewed. A literature review of postrepair aneurysm formation focuses on etiologic factors such as use of patch aortoplasty repair techniques, aortic arch hypoplasia, congenital abnormality of the aortic wall, and persistent hypertension after repair. The spectrum, onset, incidence, and potential risk factors for postcoarctation repair spinal cord ischemia are reviewed. Use of adenosine receptor agonists to achieve a state of ischemic resistance is under investigation to address this potential hazard of coarctation repair. Complications after surgery do occur in certain subsets of patients, but the risk of subsequent intervention is still lower than the hazards associated with the natural course of the defect.

### Reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with coarctation requires systematic differentiation of impacts of mixed valvular disease on coarctation hemodynamics [^113dJayW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

MVDs, which are classified as various combinations of different aortic and mitral valvular pathologies such as AS, AR, bicuspid aortic valve, MR, and MS, are often present in conjunction with COA. We sought to find out if in patients with COA and MVDs the interactions between MVDs and COA have dramatic impacts on both the local and global hemodynamics. It is important to note that in current clinical practice, proper treatment is difficult to administer when COA and MVDs are present. Treatment is often performed in a multiple‐stage approach, because higher morbidity rates have been recorded if several pathologies are repaired simultaneously. It is often unclear what the effects of each pathology are on the cardiovascular system and which pathology is more life threatening. Furthermore, timing of intervention is crucial, because the overload on the LV because of COA and MVDs is likely to lead to LV dysfunction, cardiac failure, and death if not treated promptly. To date, there are no standardized guidelines, and the ideal treatment methods are often unclear for individuals suffering from COA and MVDs. Hemodynamic significance of MVDs and COA must be analyzed carefully to establish proper treatment methods, because an individualized treatment approach is crucial for the optimal recovery of each patient. In the present work, there are several findings that should be individually discussed.

### 2018 AHA / ACC guideline for the management of adults with congenital heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^111Rmiba]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Coarctation of the aorta — diagnostic recommendations emphasize multimodality imaging and blood pressure assessment. Initial and follow-up aortic imaging using CMR or CTA is recommended in adults with coarctation of the aorta, including those who have had surgical or catheter intervention. Resting blood pressure should be measured in upper and lower extremities in all adults with coarctation of the aorta. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in adults with coarctation of the aorta can be useful for diagnosis and management of hypertension. Screening for intracranial aneurysms by magnetic resonance angiography or CTA may be reasonable in adults with coarctation of the aorta, and exercise testing to evaluate for exercise-induced hypertension may be reasonable in adults with coarctation of the aorta who exercise.

### Interventions in adults with repaired coarctation of the aorta [^111yVJvC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The need for interventions in adults with repaired coarctation of the aorta is not fully described in a contemporary patient population. Moreover, factors related to the risk of interventions of relevance to the coarctation complex require further investigation. Using data from a national register, this study aims to explore which interventions are performed in these patients and, furthermore, investigate the time of and risk factors for certain interventions related to the coarctation complex. The results have implications for planning follow‐up and giving appropriate medical advice to the growing population of adults with coarctation of the aorta.

### Aortic coarctation / arch hypoplasia repair: how small is too small [^112CsrAz]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery: Pediatric Cardiac Surgery Annual (2019). Medium credibility.

Aortic coarctation/arch hypoplasia is a relatively common congenital heart disease that leads to severe cardiovascular complications if left untreated. During the modern era, the mortality of the primary surgical repair is very low but the long-term issues, such as recurrent coarctation/arch reobstruction and hypertension, are still significant challenges. The former is related to the surgical repair performed particularly in the management of the smallish distal aortic arch, and for the latter, despite the "successful" repair of the aortic coarctation, the intrinsic vascular anomaly remains a significant long-term morbidity.

### Bicuspid aortic valve: different clinical profiles for subjects with versus without repaired aortic coarctation [^114Bfh78]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Study limitations and future directions

This study has limitations including its retrospective design. The BAV-CoA group was small compared with the BAV-only comparator, however, the 4.3% proportion is consistent with previous reports. This study also includes only patients who have clinically significant BAV related complications requiring surgical intervention. The impact, therefore, of concomitant CoA on patients across the broad spectrum of (milder) BAV disease remains unknown. In this study, quantitative data on aortic dimensions were not collected. While at our two institutions, aortic intervention was undertaken according to international guideline recommendations, the lack of aortic dimension data in our study precludes us from making firm conclusions on the nature of BAV-related aortic disease in our cohort.

Future study of 'all-comers' with BAV including longitudinal follow-up will be important, to clarify the applicability of our findings to all patients with BAV. Further clinical, scientific and imaging research, investigating the phenotypic, biological and haemodynamic differences in patients with these co-occurring conditions, is needed to elucidate the mechanisms for our findings, and guide future management strategies.

### Aortic coarctation: guidelines mismatch across the ocean [^115E5zH3]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is a congenital malformation consisting in a narrowing of the aorta, usually located at the isthmus, and generating a pressure gradient between the aortic arch and the distal thoracic aorta. Clinical appearance of severe CoA is usually in the early adulthood or earlier; 90% of untreated patients die before reaching the age of 50 years. Hypertensive vascular complications, cerebrovascular hemorrhages, aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection or rupture, aortic valve deterioration, premature coronary disease are the most frequent life-threatening complications.

Consequently the key of the diagnostic/therapeutic process is an accurate assessment of the malformation severity and of the ideal timing for intervention.

### 2018 AHA / ACC guideline for the management of adults with congenital heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^116YbP1Z]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Coarctation of the aorta — clinical synopsis highlights anatomic location, associations, and complications. CoA typically occurs near the ductal remnant and left subclavian artery. Hypertension is the most common sequela of CoA, whether repaired or unrepaired. BAV is commonly associated with CoA and is present in more than half of CoA patients. Ascending aortic aneurysms are often found in those with BAV, and aneurysms are seen at the site of coarctation repair in the descending thoracic aorta or arch. Dissection can occur, presumably more likely in the setting of poorly controlled hypertension, and even with excellent repair, hypertension remains common and predisposes to later myocardial infarction, stroke, and HF.

### Incidence and pathogenesis of neonatal candidiasis… [^116mpqfm]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Differences in the day of discharge, the size of the sample and methods of diagnosis largely account for the considerable variations in reports regarding the incidence of oral thrush at various institutions. Factors commonly listed as contributory to oral thrush, such as debility, prematurity, and so forth, were not found to be operative in the series of cases studied. Preceding antibiotic therapy did not raise the incidence of neonatal oral thrush. The lack of resistance of the newborn infant to Candida albicans infection of the mucous membranes appears to be due to intrinsic defects in immunity which are not as yet understood. Maternal vaginal candidiasis appears to be the primary source of neonatal candidiasis. The latter is most effectively prevented by adequate mycologic screening and therapy of the expectant mother. Infants infected at birth harbor Candida albicans for several days before they develop clinical evidence of oral or cutaneous candidiasis.

In view of these findings a reevaluation of public health measures for the prevention and spread of oral thrush in nurseries appears desirable.

### Nonhemodynamically significant coarctation of aorta: is it clinically significant? [^117DppEj]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Once again, we congratulate Ramachandran et al for demonstrating that, even within the subgroup of patients with nonhemodynamically significant COA, minimal increase in COA gradient had negative correlation with exercise capacity. This is quite concerning because impaired exercise capacity is a well-established negative prognostic marker in patients with cardiovascular disease. This study also raises important questions regarding the optimal diagnostic and management strategies for patients with "non-severe COA" and supports incorporating regular exercise testing in the assessment of patients with COA. However, we need better tools to determine which COA patients benefit from intervention even when the COA gradient or dimension is not at the current recommended threshold, whether intensification of medical therapy for afterload reduction would improve outcomes in this subset of COA patients and what type of intervention results in the best outcome.

### Prevalence of intracranial aneurysms in patients with coarctation of the aorta: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116dFLSX]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is associated with intracranial aneurysms (IAs); however, the prevalence and risk factors (RFs) are not well described. Current practice guidelines offer inconsistent recommendations on screening for IAs in this patient population ranging from "not recommended" (European Society of Cardiology 2020) to "recommended" (American Heart Association 2018).

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and RFs for IAs in patients with CoA.

Methods

We completed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies utilizing computed tomography or magnetic resonance angiographic screening for IAs in patients with CoA.

Results

Five cohort studies were included, representing 442 patients. The pooled prevalence of IAs in patients with CoA was 3.8% [95% CI: 0.1%-12.3%]. The results met our prespecified definition for high heterogeneity. Of 5 RFs evaluated, only hypertension was associated with the development of IAs with an odds ratio of 3.1 [95% CI: 1.1–8.2; P = 0.03]. There was an observed downward trend over time in the prevalence of IAs among the studies included.

Conclusions

The development of IAs is likely multifactorial in etiology and there may be modifiable RFs in their development. Considering the low prevalence of IAs in the pooled result, routine screening of patients with CoA for IAs is likely of low-value.

Conclusion

In conclusion, our findings give insights into the pathophysiology of CoA, supporting the haemodynamic theory of the pathogenesis. Moreover, the pleiotropic effect of p. Arg721Trp in MYH6 suggests it causes a cardiac syndrome with highly variable expressivity that is difficult to understand clinically without sequence information. Furthermore, these data emphasize the importance of sarcomere integrity for cardiac development and function.

### Background information: pathogenesis | Infection control… [^116KM3vN]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

There are four recognized routes for contamination of catheters:

- migration of skin organisms at the insertion site into the cutaneous catheter tract and along the surface of the catheter with colonization of the catheter tip; this is the most common route of infection for short-term catheters;
- direct contamination of the catheter or catheter hub by contact with hands or contaminated fluids or devices;. On the other hand, biofilm formation by C. albicans occurs more readily on silicone elastomer catheter surfaces than polyurethane catheters. Modification of the biomaterial surface properties has been shown to influence the ability of C. albicans to form biofilm. Additionally, certain catheter materials are more thrombogenic than others, a characteristic that also might predispose to catheter colonization and infection.

This association has led to emphasis on preventing catheter-related thrombus as an additional mechanism for reducing CRBSI. The adherence properties of a given microorganism in relationship to host factors are also important in the pathogenesis of CRBSI. For example. S. aureus can adhere to host proteins commonly present on catheters by expressing clumping factors that bind to the protein adhesins. Furthermore, adherence is enhanced through the production by microbial organisms, such as coagulase negative staphylococci, S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida species of an extracellular polymeric substance consisting mostly of an exopolysaccharide that forms a microbial biofilm layer. Such a biofilm potentiates the pathogenicity of various microbes by allowing them to withstand host defense mechanisms or by making them less susceptible to antimicrobial agents.

Coarctation of the aorta — clinical features, complications, and follow-up highlight key diagnostic and surveillance points. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is useful for evaluating the gradient across the CoA, as well as identifying a coexisting bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and other congenital defects. Echocardiogram is indicated in the evaluation of patients with CoA because a BAV coexists in at least 50% of cases. Upper extremity hypertension and lower extremity hypoperfusion are the hallmarks of CoA. Untreated CoA may be complicated by aortic dissection, heart failure, ruptured cerebral aneurysm, distal hypoperfusion, or the consequences of significant hypertension, and late complications following surgical or endovascular CoA repair may include undersized grafts, recurrent stenosis, aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm formation, and rupture. Hypertension is common after CoA repair, especially during exercise, and ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring and exercise testing are useful in diagnosis and management. Lifelong clinical and imaging follow-up is important to evaluate for hypertension, recurrent coarctation, and aortic abnormalities after repair.

### Pseudoaneurysm of the descending aorta two decades after aortic coarctation repair: a case report [^117LiWUh]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Previous studies have focused on the predictors of pseudoaneurysm formation following CoA repair. It has been reported that patch aortoplasty using synthetic materials is associated with an elevated risk of pseudoaneurysm or true aneurysm formation, with the documented risk up to 21–50%. Additionally, advanced age at the time of CoA repair — specifically beyond a threshold of 13.5 years — has been identified as a potential risk factor.

A proposed theory is that the pathology of CoA affects the arterial system as a whole regarding its association with widespread vascular abnormalities, such as AD and structural defects in the aorta, especially when accompanied by a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). Aneurysm may form not only at the site of previous repair, but also in contiguous or remote segments of the aorta, and can also occur in patients without prior surgeries. Notably, intracranial aneurysms are observed in around 10% of patients with CoA, a considerably higher occurrence compared to the general population, as the shared developmental origin of CoA and related vascular anomalies points to a defect in neural crest cells, which contribute to the formation of the aortic arch and other arteries. Therefore, according to this theory, CoA should be regarded as a diffuse arteriopathy rather than a localized abnormality.

### Giant aneurysms associated with aortic coarctation: management challenges and options [^116DfUsp]. Pediatric Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

The management of giant aneurysms associated with aortic coarctation is challenging. The location, the size of the aneurysm, whether it has ruptured, previous coarctation repair, the presence of stenosis, and the ascending and distal aortic pathology will all influence the treatment approach. With more patients surviving to adulthood after early coarctation repair, a better understanding of the anatomy, pathophysiology, and radiological findings of coarctation-related aneurysms is imperative to providing sound care. We present here our experience with a series of giant aneurysms of the aorta, all with a background of underlying aortic coarctation. We highlight the decision-making process and review current management trends.

### Bicuspid aortic valve: different clinical profiles for subjects with versus without repaired aortic coarctation [^1131dr9G]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

The significance of CoA for the possible ascending aortic complications of BAV has been more widely studied. It appears that the presence of coarctation is not associated with aortic dilatation, as paediatric studies have found children with concomitant CoA actually have smaller aortic dimensions, and slower rates of aortic dilatation. Once again in adulthood, however, the impact of CoA on BAV-related aortic complications is contentious. While some data suggest that BAV-CoA patients are more likely to develop aortic complications (predominantly driven by increased aneurysm risk, although dissection risk also appears to be higher), other data suggest there is no difference in aortic complications. Despite the conflicting evidence, clinically there remains sufficient concern of the potential increase in risk, which is reflected in the lower threshold for aortic surgery for patients with BAV-CoA in the European guidelines.

Introduction

Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is the most common birth defect of the aorta with an incidence of about one per 2500 live births. It is defined by local narrowing of the proximal descending aorta and/or aortic arch, accompanied by bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) in more than 50% of cases and generally presenting as either neonatal heart failure or hypertension later in life. Surgical or interventional treatment considerably improves outcome but risk of premature cardiovascular morbidity and mortality remains despite appropriate therapy.

Coarctation of the aorta is primarily a non-familial or sporadic disease. However, it has been shown to cosegregate in families with left-ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) malformations, a mechanistically defined subgroup of congenital heart defects (CHDs) including CoA, BAV, congenital aortic stenosis, and hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). As a group, the LVOTO malformations are markedly heritable (0.71–0.90) and have a high relative risk for first-degree relatives (36.9). In addition, around 15% of individuals with CoA occur as part of a recognized genetic syndrome (e.g. 45, X, or Turner).

Not much is known about genetic causes of non-syndromic CoA. Several studies have found mutations in families with LVOTO malformations and a few instances of sporadic CoA, both with and without concomitant CHDs. The most strongly implicated gene is NOTCH1, encoding a transmembrane receptor that regulates cell fate during development. Mutations in other genes, including MYH6, SMAD6, NKX2–5, and GATA5, have been found in one or few individuals with CoA. The MYH6 mutations were found in two families, one with predisposition to atrial septal defect (ASD)and the other to HLHS. Some individuals in these families presented with CoA. In addition, knockout in mice of several genes found within copy number variants in individuals with CoA, including MCTP2, MATR3, and FOXC1, have resulted in CoA-like phenotypes.

### Hypertension at diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta as a risk factor for recoarctation [^112PcLr8]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Apart from the severity of coarctation, long-term survival rates are significantly affected by age at intervention, with the lowest mortality rates observed in patients who underwent surgery between 1 year and 5 years of age, as well as by arterial BP at the first post-operative visit. Late cardiovascular complications after operative repair of CoA include systemic hypertension, premature coronary artery disease, aortic valve abnormalities, aortic aneurysm, and recoarctation. Recoarctation is reported to occur after successful operative repair in 3–26% of survivors.

In addition, CoA has been associated with an increased risk of intracranial aneurysms (IA) and their rupture, which occur at an early age compared with patients without CoA. To explain this association, there are two main etiopathologic factors- the first is vascular developmental abnormality and the second is that arterial hypertension is a main risk factor for the development of these aneurysms.

Previous studies have shown that systemic arterial hypertension following coarctation repair is common and often observed even in patients with a successful CoA repair and is associated with significant morbidity and early mortality. It is postulated that there is a residual narrowing of the aorta in addition to dysfunction of the normal control mechanisms regulating BP during growth and development in patients with repaired CoA. In our study, we examined the association between the presence of hypertension at the diagnosis of CoA and the clinical outcomes of these patients, and explored the possibility that hypertension at the initial presentation of CoA could be indicative of the prognosis of CoA patients. The findings have the potential to change the routine follow-up after patients with HTN following their first diagnosis of CoA, with close monitoring, magnetic resonance imaging from an early age for IA diagnosis, and home BP measurements.

Coarctation of the aorta and bicuspid aortic valve — supportive epidemiology notes that CoA has a male-to-female ratio of 1.5:1 and that a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is present in 50% to 70% of cases of CoA.

### Stroke in adults with coarctation of the aorta: a national population-based study [^112P2a78]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

In our analyses, we considered only isolated CoA, excluding those with complex associated lesions, such as congenital mitral valve disease. We were unable to completely account for the effect of BAV in this population, which is present in > 50% of CoA patients, because of the known limitations of accurately identifying patients with BAV in administrative databases. 31 However, when we adjusted for BAV in our sensitivity analysis, there was no change in our estimate of the association of CoA with age at ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.

Notably, the association of CoA with age at stroke was not significantly attenuated by inclusion of hypertension in the model, nor with the inclusion of an interaction term. These results suggest that blood pressure management alone may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of stroke in this population. However, we cannot exclude the role that hypertension may play in the pathogenesis of stroke in this patient population because it is a well‐established risk factor for intracranial aneurysm formation and rupture in the general population and is present in 86% of CoA patients with stroke. 12, 33 Although CoA is a known risk factor for hypertension, the prevalence of hypertension in our data set was similar in patients with or without CoA. This is not unexpected in a population of stroke patients, because hypertension is a known risk factor for stroke, independent of CoA.

There is the potential for selection bias, because only those patients who survive long enough to have a stroke are included in the analyses. Therefore, younger age of stroke in those with CoA may in small part be because of early mortality of patients with CoA compared with the general population. However, prior analyses have found only a 5‐ to 10‐year reduction in life expectancy for patients with CoA, in large part because of cerebrovascular disease. 4 Therefore, it is unlikely that underlying differences in population age distributions explain our findings of CoA patients having all‐cause stroke at ages 20 years younger and hemorrhagic stroke at ages 28 years younger than the general population.

There are multiple proposed contributors to the early age of stroke in patients with CoA. Long‐term vascular dysfunction and increased carotid intima‐medial thickness may increase the risk of ischemic stroke. 13, 34, 35, 36, 37 In addition, CoA patients are more likely to be male and have hyperlipidemia. 38, 39 There is a high prevalence (10%–12%) of intracranial aneurysms, which may predispose to hemorrhagic stroke. 11, 12 The high prevalence of systemic hypertension (> 50%) increases the risk of both hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke. 40, 41

### Analysis of 3-dimensional arch anatomy, vascular flow, and postnatal outcome in cases of suspected coarctation of the aorta using fetal cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [^1168W6T1]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

The exact pathophysiological mechanisms that lead to the development of CoA are still poorly understood, despite the first such theories being proposed over 180 years ago. – The so-called branching theory, proposed by Hutchinsin 1971, postulates that reduced or reversed flow at the isthmus leads to the distal arch becoming a functional branch of the DA (Figure 1). This theory is based on the observation, from surgically resected specimens, that the posterior shelf — the ridge of infolded tissue associated with isthmal obstruction following DA closure — is histologically identical to the arterial infolding seen in other major aortic branches. The increased distance between the left subclavian and the left common carotid arteries, often observed in coarctation, is similarly explained by retrograde filling of the left subclavian from the DA.

B, Potential mechanism of neonatal coarctation proposed by Hutchins et al. Reduced or reversed flow at the isthmus leads to the distal aortic arch becoming a functional branch of the arterial duct. The apex of this "branch point" is then responsible for the posterior infolding observed in neonatal coarctation, following physiological obliteration (Oblit.) of the arterial duct.

Recent advances in prenatal cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have allowed for the generation of reliable, high-resolution, 3-dimensional (3D) imaging of the fetal vasculature in the early third trimester. In addition, separate phase-contrast techniques have been developed and validated to measure flows in the major fetal vessels using novel post hoc cardiac gating algorithms. The aim of this study was to combine these 2 novel fetal MRI techniques to investigate fetuses with suspected CoA, hypothesizing that (1) there is a definable relationship between aortic arch geometry and underlying vascular flow and (2) this relationship can be used to more accurately predict critical or duct-dependent neonatal CoA from prenatal imaging.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the care of girls and women with Turner syndrome [^112rCCuY]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for coarctation of aorta, more specifically with respect to patients with Turner's syndrome, ESE/PES 2024 guidelines recommend to decide on the mode of delivery based on the safest method to prevent aortic and obstetric complications, individual preferences, and local professional expertise. Consider implementing preventive measures (epidural anesthesia, expedited second stage of labor) to reduce the risk of aortic dissection, especially in the presence of aortic dilation (aortic height index > 20 mm/m, aortic size index > 2.0 cm/m², or Z > 2.5) or additional risk factors for aortic dissection (bicuspid aortic valve, aortic coarctation, hypertension, rapid aortic diameter increase). Prefer Cesarean delivery in patients with severe aortic dilation (aortic height index > 25 mm/m, aortic size index > 2.5 cm/m², or Z > 4) or a history of aortic dissection.

### Nonhemodynamically significant coarctation of aorta: is it clinically significant? [^115x6RcH]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

We congratulate Ramachandran et alfor their recent article titled 'Anatomical/Physiological Correlates of Functional Capacity in Adults with Repaired and Non-Severe Coarctation of the Aorta'. This was a retrospective cross-sectional study assessing the relationship between the severity of coarctation of aorta (COA) and exercise capacity in patients without hemodynamically significant COA, albeit, limited by small sample size. The study showed an association between COA severity, as measured by aortic isthmus gradient and aortic isthmus size, and exercise capacity, as measured by exercise time and metabolic equivalents (METs).

COA is characterized by aortic isthmus stenosis and/or aortic arch hypoplasia. In addition to these anatomic defects, patients with COA also have physiologic defects characterized by endothelial dysfunction, abnormal smooth muscle reactivity, and abnormal sympathetic activation, and these in turn, lead to increased aortic stiffness. In addition to these anatomic and physiologic defects, the differences in tissue characteristics of the aortic isthmus, especially in patients with prior COA repair, alter aortic dynamics leading to early arrival of the reflected aortic wave in late systole (instead of early diastole). This leads to an increase in the left ventricular (LV) systolic afterload, as well as a decrease in diastolic perfusion pressure required for adequate coronary blood flow and myocardial perfusion. Collectively, these anatomic and physiologic abnormalities lead to LV remodeling, that is characterized by LV hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction (impaired relaxation and compliance), and systolic dysfunction.

Regarding surgical interventions for coarctation of aorta, more specifically with respect to indications for procedural intervention, EACTS/STS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider performing open or endovascular repair in asymptomatic patients with CoA with a systolic gradient across the stenosis at rest (> 20 mmHg) and/or SBP difference > 10 mmHg combined with coarctation-attributed HF and/or proximal hypertension.
