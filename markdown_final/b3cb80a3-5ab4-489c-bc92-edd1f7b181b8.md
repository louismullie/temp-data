## Question

What would be a hyper intense lesion in the thoracic spinal cord on MRI in a patient with steroids

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret a hyperintense thoracic spinal cord lesion on MRI in a patient who is receiving steroids. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the MRI signal characteristics and lesion morphology. Then, I should verify the clinical context and timing relative to steroid exposure. Next, I will generate a prioritized differential diagnosis and map each entity to expected imaging patterns. After that, I need to check for steroid-responsive versus steroid-refractory or steroid-exacerbated entities. Finally, I will outline immediate diagnostic steps, management implications, and red flags that mandate urgent action, while continuously validating assumptions against the literature at each step.

> Let me first confirm the imaging construct: a hyperintense thoracic cord lesion on T2-weighted MRI reflects increased water content, which is nonspecific and can reflect edema, demyelination, ischemia, infection, or neoplasm. I need to check the longitudinal extent, axial distribution, cord expansion, enhancement pattern, and diffusion restriction to narrow the etiology, because these features carry diagnostic weight in myelopathies [^111L61mc] [^111pUEXX].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical context before jumping to conclusions: I should confirm whether steroids were started before or after symptom onset, whether there was a preceding infection or vaccination, the tempo of progression, and any red flags such as fever, weight loss, or prior radiation. Steroid timing matters because early steroids can suppress enhancement and mask activity, while delayed or inadequate therapy may allow lesion evolution, and some entities like GFAP astrocytopathy can progress despite steroids [^117PMa4n] [^1133jBmy].

> I will now examine the most likely inflammatory demyelinating etiologies: multiple sclerosis typically shows short-segment, peripherally located T2 lesions with transient enhancement and may involve thoracic cord. MOGAD often produces longitudinally extensive gray-matter–predominant lesions that frequently resolve completely. NMOSD classically causes longitudinally extensive lesions with central gray matter involvement and sometimes ring or patchy enhancement. GFAP astrocytopathy can show longitudinally extensive central cord signal with leptomeningeal enhancement and may be steroid responsive but sometimes requires plasmapheresis. Idiopathic transverse myelitis is a diagnosis of exclusion with variable enhancement and pleocytosis on CSF [^114GrHgF] [^116UUYrH] [^114YqimP] [^117PMa4n].

> Hold on, I should verify vascular mimics because steroids can worsen some of them: spinal dural arteriovenous fistula can present with long-segment T2 hyperintensity, cord expansion, and perimedullary flow voids. Steroids may transiently worsen venous congestion and precipitate clinical decline, so clinical deterioration after steroids is a red flag for SDAVF and should trigger vascular imaging. Spinal cord infarction typically shows anterior or central cord T2 hyperintensity with restricted diffusion acutely and a long-segment pattern on sagittal imaging [^114aqmYa] [^115UrySY] [^113moCyQ].

> But wait, what if the lesion is neoplastic rather than inflammatory: primary CNS lymphoma or intramedullary glioma can mimic demyelination with expansile, enhancing cord lesions. I need to check for persistent enhancement beyond 3 months, progressive symptoms despite immunotherapy, and atypical enhancement patterns. A staccato clinical course with transient steroid responsiveness can occur in lymphoma, so I should not anchor on inflammation just because steroids helped transiently [^115wTagH] [^111tUzfx] [^115BbutQ].

> I should double-check infectious and post-infectious causes: acute disseminated encephalomyelitis can produce long-segment T2 lesions in the cord after a prodrome. Bacterial meningitis–associated myelitis may show thoracic involvement and variable enhancement. Acute flaccid myelitis shows central gray matter T2 hyperintensity with anterior horn involvement. Parasitic etiologies like neurocysticercosis can show ring-enhancing lesions with surrounding edema and may warrant steroids as adjuncts [^113fLmh9] [^115mrPVE] [^112DHUrS] [^114RSPAA].

> Let me consider metabolic and nutritional etiologies briefly: subacute combined degeneration from B12 deficiency or nitrous oxide exposure shows dorsal column T2 hyperintensity and may involve thoracic cord. HIV myelopathy can produce dorsal column signal abnormality with cord atrophy. These are less likely if there is acute enhancement or a steroid-responsive inflammatory pattern, but I should confirm risk factors and labs before excluding them [^116bE2z2] [^11189Cos].

> Next, I should review steroid-responsive versus steroid-refractory patterns to refine probability: steroid-responsive entities include most idiopathic transverse myelitis, ADEM, MOGAD, and some GFAP astrocytopathy. Steroid-refractory or steroid-exacerbated entities include SDAVF and certain neoplasms. In MOGAD, early treatment accelerates T2-lesion resolution, and in GFAP astrocytopathy, escalation to plasmapheresis may be required if steroids fail. Conversely, transient improvement with steroids does not exclude lymphoma or glioma, so I must not overinterpret early steroid responsiveness [^111eddSu] [^117PMa4n] [^115BbutQ].

> I need to ensure I am not missing radiation-related injury: radiation myelopathy presents with T2 hyperintensity and enhancement after sufficient dose and latency. It is a diagnosis of exclusion requiring dose, timing, and spatial correlation with the irradiated field. Steroids may be tried, but recovery is limited and prevention via dose constraints is key [^1166R38V].

> Now, let me outline the immediate diagnostic steps I should take: obtain a complete spine MRI with and without gadolinium to characterize lesion length, enhancement, expansion, axial distribution, and look for perimedullary flow voids. Perform brain MRI to assess for dissemination in space and atypical patterns. Obtain CSF for cell count, protein, oligoclonal bands, IgG index, and send AQP4-IgG and MOG-IgG on cell-based assays. Order HIV, syphilis, and TB testing if risk factors exist. Consider angiography or MR venography if SDAVF is suspected. And if imaging and serologies are nondiagnostic with persistent concern for neoplasm, discuss biopsy with neurosurgery [^113mX4kA] [^114YqimP] [^115wTagH] [^115UrySY] [^116Vd1BS].

> I should confirm management implications now: if an inflammatory demyelinating process is likely, initiate high-dose IV methylprednisolone and plan for escalation to plasmapheresis or IVIG if there is inadequate response. If SDAVF is suspected, avoid steroids and pursue urgent endovascular treatment. If neoplasm is suspected, coordinate tissue diagnosis and oncologic management. If infection is possible, start appropriate antimicrobials and adjust based on cultures. If radiation myelopathy is suspected, supportive care and rehabilitation are central with steroids as a trial [^117PMa4n] [^114aqmYa] [^116Vd1BS] [^115mrPVE] [^1166R38V].

> Hold on, I should verify red flags that demand urgent alternative pathways: clinical deterioration after steroids raises SDAVF or neoplasm. Persistent enhancement beyond 3 months favors neoplasm. Longitudinally extensive central gray matter involvement supports NMOSD or MOGAD. Leptomeningeal enhancement suggests neurosarcoidosis or GFAP astrocytopathy. Perimedullary flow voids indicate SDAVF. And rapid symptom onset with normal initial MRI can occur in idiopathic transverse myelitis, so a single negative study early does not exclude disease [^114aqmYa] [^115BbutQ] [^114YqimP] [^117PMa4n] [^115UrySY] [^115m8e83].

> Let me reconsider the original question in plain terms: in a patient on steroids with a hyperintense thoracic cord lesion, the most likely explanation remains an inflammatory demyelinating process such as MOGAD, NMOSD, GFAP astrocytopathy, or idiopathic transverse myelitis, but I must actively exclude vascular malformations like SDAVF and neoplastic mimics because steroids can obscure or worsen the former and transiently improve the latter. The safest approach is to complete comprehensive MRI, CSF, and antibody testing, then tailor escalation to the emerging etiology while watching closely for steroid paradoxes [^116UUYrH] [^114YqimP] [^117PMa4n] [^115wTagH] [^114aqmYa].

A hyperintense thoracic spinal cord lesion on MRI in a patient on steroids most commonly reflects **active demyelination** (MS, NMOSD, MOGAD) [^116UUYrH] or **steroid-responsive inflammatory myelitis** (sarcoidosis, systemic lupus, paraneoplastic) [^114Ft1Yq]. Steroids can **mask enhancement**, so persistent T2 hyperintensity without gadolinium enhancement may still indicate active inflammation [^notfound]. Other causes include infection (TB, HIV, viral), ischemia, radiation, or neoplasm; these should be considered if the clinical course is atypical or steroids fail [^115wTagH]. Management is guided by the underlying cause, with **steroids for demyelination/inflammation** and alternative therapies for steroid-refractory cases [^117PMa4n] [^114YqimP].

## Clinical significance of hyperintense thoracic spinal cord lesions

Hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted MRI reflect **increased water content** — edema, demyelination, or gliosis — and indicate active pathology. In patients on steroids, these lesions often reflect ongoing inflammation despite immunosuppression [^117PMa4n].

## Influence of steroid therapy on MRI findings

Steroids reduce inflammation and can **suppress gadolinium enhancement**, potentially masking active lesions [^115UrYfj]. Thus, persistent T2 hyperintensity without enhancement may still reflect active inflammation [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

- **Demyelinating diseases**: High-dose intravenous steroids are first-line; escalation to plasma exchange or IVIG if refractory [^115Vfa27].
- **Inflammatory myelitis**: Steroids are first-line; immunosuppressive agents (e.g. rituximab, azathioprine) for maintenance [^116S6kGJ].
- **Infectious myelitis**: Treat the underlying infection; steroids as adjuncts in select cases (e.g. TB, HIV) [^114DpmNt].
- **Ischemic myelopathy**: Supportive care; steroids not indicated.
- **Radiation myelopathy**: Steroids may provide symptomatic relief but prognosis is poor [^1166R38V].
- **Neoplastic lesions**: Surgical resection, radiation, or chemotherapy based on tumor type and stage [^115sha9p].

---

## Prognostic significance

Prognosis depends on the **underlying cause**, lesion severity, and treatment response. Demyelinating and inflammatory myelitides often improve with steroids, whereas ischemic, radiation-related, and neoplastic lesions carry poorer prognoses [^111Gfh91] [^1166R38V] [^113SmufD] [^115mRaQR].

---

A hyperintense thoracic spinal cord lesion on MRI in a patient on steroids most often reflects **active demyelination or inflammatory myelitis**, but infection, ischemia, radiation, and neoplasm must be considered. Steroids can suppress enhancement, so persistent T2 hyperintensity without enhancement may still indicate active disease. Management is cause-specific, with steroids for demyelination/inflammation and alternative therapies for refractory cases.

Myelopathy refers to any pathologic process that involves the spinal cord, and can be caused by a variety of different diseases. MR imaging is the primary modality for evaluating the patient presenting with myelopathy. The first step must be the exclusion of spinal cord compression. Although the MR features of many causes of myelopathy overlap, careful attention to the time course of presentation, knowledge of common and uncommon causes of myelopathy, and identification of specific imaging patterns and features can help narrow the differential diagnosis or establish a definitive diagnosis.

### MRI findings of spinal visceral larva migrans of toxocara canis [^114ZQMwe]. European Journal of Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study is to investigate the MRI findings of visceral larva migrans (VLS) of Toxocara canis in spinal cord.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed spinal MRI findings in eight patients with serologically proven Toxocara canis between 2005 and 2008. We evaluated the location, length, extent and migration of the lesion, MR signal intensity (SI), enhancement pattern, and swelling of the spinal cord. We evaluated clinical features including presenting symptoms and signs and treatment response.

Results

Total 8 patients (M = 8; age range 36–79 years) were included. The lesions were located in the cervical or thoracic spinal cord in all patients. All lesions showed high SI and minimal or mild swelling of involved spinal cord on T2WI and focal nodular enhancement on posterior or posterolateral segment of spinal cord. The length of involved lesion was relatively short in most patients. There was a migration of lesion in one patient. In spite of albendazole or steroid treatment, neurological symptoms or signs were not significantly improved in all patients.

Conclusion

Although all lesions show non-specific imaging findings like non-tumorous myelopathy mimicking transverse myelitis, single lesion, focal nodular enhancement on posterior or posterolateral segment of spinal cord, relatively short segmental involvement and migration of lesion may be characteristic findings of spinal VLM of Toxocara canis. In addition, the reluctant response to the treatment may be characteristic of spinal VLM of Toxocara canis.

MRI is widely used as the imaging of choice for spinal disorders and may reveal either a clinically insignificant incidental abnormality or a significant lesion, unrelated to the spine, which may explain the patient's symptoms. This article attempts to establish the importance of such findings and describes a sensible approach to the reporting of MRI examinations of the spine with special attention to the incidental findings commonly encountered. The MRI characteristics of such findings are briefly described.

General considerations when using MRI for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis

There are general considerations when applying the MRI aspects of the 2017 revision of the McDonald criteria in the diagnostic work-up of patients with suspected multiple sclerosis:
The clinical syndrome should be typical of demyelination.
The criteria should be applied to adult patients (between 18 and 50 years); however, they also perform well in identifying paediatric patients with multiple sclerosis from those suffering from monophasic demyelination, although special care is needed in patients under 11 years. In paediatric cases, the presence of at least one black hole (a hypointense lesion on T 1 -weighted sequence) and at least one periventricular lesion at baseline contribute to distinguish children with multiple sclerosis from those with monophasic demyelination. For a comprehensive review of multiple sclerosis differential diagnosis in pediatric population, which is beyond the scope of this review, see.
In patients older than 50 years or with vascular risk factors, more stringent criteria should be considered [e.g. a higher number of periventricular lesions (abutting the lateral ventricles, see below for details)].
MRI studies should be of adequate quality, with few artefacts and performed on scanners with a minimum field strength of 1.5 T. Using 3D acquisitions or 2D with 3-mm thick slices and no gap between slices (see; for MRI protocols proposed and Table 1 for sequence suggestions) will increase diagnostic yield.
Key MRI sequences include T 2 -weighted and T 1 pre- and post-gadolinium images of the brain and the spinal cord (Table 1).
Multiple sclerosis lesions can occur anywhere in the CNS, and thus MRI of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine should be considered in patients with symptoms referable to these locations, and for detecting subclinical lesions (particularly in the spinal cord). Indeed, spinal cord assessment can be helpful in establishing dissemination in space when brain MRI findings are not conclusive and might provide significant prognostic information.
Fat-suppressed MRIs of the optic nerves should be considered especially in atypical cases to rule out possible alternative diagnoses.
Lesions should be confirmed on multiple planes to avoid false positive findings due to artefacts and false negative results (Table 1). The acquisition of 3D sequences [e.g. T 2 -fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T 2 -FLAIR)] can allow multi-planar reconstruction, whilst, especially for 2D acquisitions, a second imaging sequence on a different plane (e.g. sagittal) should be acquired.
Serial imaging can support the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, given that multiple sclerosis is characterized by the accrual of lesions over time and in new areas of the CNS.
Interpretation of the MRI scans should be performed by trained (neuro)radiologists or clinicians deeply familiar with the features of multiple sclerosis and disorders considered in the differential diagnosis.
T 2 lesions can increase, decrease or stabilize in size over time; more rarely, small lesions completely disappear.
The pattern of gadolinium-enhancement in multiple sclerosis lesions is variable but almost always transient (2–8 weeks, although typically < 4 weeks).
For the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, there should be at least one typical multiple sclerosis lesion in at least two characteristic regions [periventricular (abutting the lateral ventricles), juxtacortical/cortical, infratentorial, spinal cord] to support dissemination in space.
Brain white matter lesions are common in patients with comorbid vascular disease or migraine, as well as healthy adult subjects, and as non-specific small, rounded deep white matter lesions sparing the periventricular zone and U-fibres can also contribute to some of the lesion burden present on imaging. Currently, it is rarely possible to distinguish whether individual lesions are attributable to demyelination or to a comorbidity.
Especially for patients with a small number of lesions, individual lesion characteristics (size, ovoid shape, orientation perpendicular to ventricles, T 1 hypointensity, pattern of enhancement) are important in determining whether they are characteristic of multiple sclerosis; for patients with a large number of lesions, the distribution (periventricular predilection, combinations of brain and cord lesions, etc.) is more relevant.

Panel A: Representative patient (#1) with MOG-IgG and typical MS features: T2-weighted/axial FLAIR brain and cervical spinal cord MRI at onset (A.a–A.d) showed well-defined supra and infratentorial typical MS lesions (vertical white arrows). Note that despite spinal cord MRI showing involvement of ≥ 3 consecutive segments (A.d wide horizontal arrow), the image is not typical for MOGAD because it showed additional short spinal cord lesions (A.d, narrow horizontal arrows); T2-weighted/axial FLAIR brain MRI at last follow-up (5 years) (A.e) showed persistent T2 typical MS lesions, global atrophy, and hypointense lesions in T1 sequences (A.f). (B, C, D, and E) Representative patients with overlapping MOGAD-MS features. Panel B (patient #5): T2-weighted/axial FLAIR brain MRI at onset with right frontal cortical gyri and sulci hyperintensity (B.a); T2-weighted/axial FLAIR and T1-weighted postcontrast MRI after 3 months of follow-up showed new silent periventricular lesions (B.b), one with Gd+ enhancement (B.c); T2-weighted sagittal spinal cord MRI at 5-year follow-up showed no abnormalities (B.d); T2-weighted/axial FLAIR brain MRI at last follow-up (9 years) (B.e) showed persistent T2/FLAIR periventricular and CC typical MS lesions along with global atrophy and hypointense lesions in T1 sequences (B.f). Panel C (patient #6): Axial T1-weighted postcontrast brain MRI (C.a) and sagittal T1-weighted postcontrast cervical-thoracic spine MRI (C.b) at disease onset demonstrate bilateral optic nerve involvement with gadolinium enhancement (C.a) and 3 short spinal cord lesions (C.b). T2-weighted/axial FLAIR brain MRI (C.c-C.d) showed new silent periventricular lesions before the initiation of disease-modifying treatment (DMT) (C.c), as well as a new juxtacortical lesion 4 months after initiation of interferon beta-1a (C.d). At the last follow-up, T2-weighted/axial FLAIR brain MRI (C.e) and axial T1-weighted postcontrast MRI (C.f) revealed persistence of the left periventricular lesion. Panel D (patient #7): T2-weighted axial (D.a-D.b), axial FLAIR brain (D.c), and sagittal T1-weighted postcontrast cervical (D.d) MRI sequences at onset showing mixed well and ill-defined brainstem lesions (D.a-D.b), one well-defined right periventricular lesion (D.c), and one short spinal cord lesion with Gd+ enhancement (D.d). Sagittal T1-weighted postcontrast spinal cord MRI at 3 months of follow-up (D.e) showed a new silent short spinal cord lesion with Gd+ enhancement; axial T1 brain MRI (D.f) at last follow-up (6 years) showed persistence of the right periventricular T1 hypointense lesion (D.f). Panel E (patient #8): T2-weighted/axial FLAIR brain and spinal cord MRI at onset (E.a–E.d) with well-defined silent brainstem (E.a) and periventricular (E.b and E.c) lesions typical of MS and short symptomatic spinal cord lesion (E.d). T2-weighted/axial FLAIR brain MRI at 4 months after disease onset showed a new silent periventricular lesion (E.e); T2-weighted/axial FLAIR brain MRI performed 3 months after the initiation of fingolimod therapy, as well as a subsequent brain MRI scans at 3 and 8 months following the initiation of anti-CD20 therapy revealed new silent lesions typical of MS (not shown).

The differential diagnosis also included infectious causes. Both neurosyphilis and tuberculosis, for example, could rarely manifest as enhancing longitudinally extensive lesion(s) causing progressive subacute symptoms. However, an infectious etiology was less likely in this patient who had no infectious symptoms or identifiable exposures on presentation of her neurologic symptoms and had an extensive negative workup for infections, including negative screens for syphilis and HIV as well as negative CSF cultures, VDRL, and viral studies.

Finally, the insidious and gradually progressive nature of the patient's symptoms over many months placed malignancy high on the differential diagnosis list. The Table summarizes the typical clinical and radiologic features differentiating a spinal cord tumor from an inflammatory/autoimmune myelopathy. The patient's enhancing, expansile cervical cord lesion at symptom onset was concerning for a primary CNS lymphoma or glioma. Like autoimmune/inflammatory myelopathies, primary CNS lymphoma could develop longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions and would be frequently isointense to hypointense on T1-weighted sequence in addition to high signal intensity on T2-weighted images and enhancement with contrast. Although spinal cord swelling would be typically seen, some patients (approximately 40%) with spinal cord lymphoma could have intramedullary lesions without edema, mimicking a non-neoplastic etiology. Spinal cord gliomas could also develop intramedullary longitudinally extensive lesions. They could cause cervico-thoracic T2-hyperintense spinal cord lesions and diffusely involve the cross-sectional area of the cord with homogenous contrast enhancement. Spinal cord astrocytomas, a type of glioma, could mimic MOGAD-associated spinal cord lesions (including involvement of the conus) but would be distinguished by their excentric location and irregular margins. Intramedullary spinal cord metastases (the most common of which originate from lung or breast) could mimic inflammatory lesions with a circular border of enhancement on imaging similar to that seen in NMOSD. However, there may be a greater tendency of intramedullary spinal cord metastases to have their circular border of enhancement capped by a flame-like taper on either end, which would not be typical of inflammatory/autoimmune myelopathies. In our patient, the tapering of the expansile spinal cord lesion at the caudal and rostral aspects would be unusual for an inflammatory/autoimmune myelopathy and could favor a spinal cord tumor (Figure 2, A–F). Metastatic spinal cord lesions typically show low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, but our patient's cord lesion was isointense on T1-weighted sequences (Figure 2). Neoplastic causes of longitudinally extensive myelopathies should be suspected if the patient's symptoms continued to progress despite treatment with methylprednisolone or plasma exchange or if the patient's spinal cord imaging showed persistent contrast enhancement after 3 months of onset. A spinal cord biopsy may be necessary to reach a diagnosis.

### Twenty-nine cases of enterovirus-D68-associated acute flaccid myelitis in Europe 2016: a case series and epidemiologic overview [^112DHUrS]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

MRI was reported to be abnormal in 25 cases, with hyperintensity in the central grey matter of the cervical and/or thoracic spine in 23 patients and hyperintensity of the dorsal brainstem in 17 patients. Figure 1 shows the typical AFM lesions on MRI for 2 patients. EMG was performed in 11 patients and generally revealed decreased amplitude of compound motor action potentials with normal conduction velocities and absence of conduction blocks, compatible with anterior horn cell disease. Spontaneous muscle fiber activity, either positive sharp waves or fibrillations, was found in the affected muscles when needle EMG was performed after sufficient time (range: 7 days to 3 months).

FIGURE 1.
Typical magnetic resonance imaging findings in patients with enterovirus-D68–associated acute flaccid myelitis. Magnetic resonance images of 2 cases (case a: A–C; case b: D–E), dating from the first week after the start of neurologic symptoms, showing typical imaging features of AFM. A + D, Transversal T2-weighted images of the brain show a slight hyperintensity (arrow) in the dorsal pons. B + E, Sagittal T2-weighted images show hyperintensity (arrow) of the central gray matter in the cervical and thoracic regions in both patients. C, A sagittal T1-weighted image with gadolinium shows enhancement (arrows) of the caudal roots.

Most patients were treated with intravenous immunoglobulins (n = 20), steroids (n = 17) or both (n = 15), with typically only partial recovery over time. Follow-up time ranged from 0.5 to 12 months. Two patients, who both showed EV-D68 in the CSF, died. One was a 55-year-old immunocompromised woman, who died of respiratory failure. The second was a 3.5-year-old child, who died of severe ventilation acquired pneumonia with septic shock.

### Intramedullary spinal cord tumors and tumor-like lesions [^113SmufD]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Intramedullary spinal cord tumors are rare neoplasms that can result in significant patient morbidity and mortality. Symptom onset is often insidious and not specific; thus, imaging is imperative for accurate diagnosis and localization of these tumors. Radiologists should be familiar with the key MR imaging features of common and unusual intramedullary tumors, in order to identify the most likely diagnosis or at a minimum develop an accurate differential diagnosis as this in turn will guide management.

### Constipation in transverse myelitis [^114XqWVX]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Given the sudden onset, cerebrovascular accident was first ruled out by MRI of the brain and CT angiography of the head and neck. Further working diagnoses included Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) and bacterial meningitis, which were ruled out clinically due to bowel and bladder involvement as well as by CSF studies. Then, the patient underwent MRI of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine to evaluate for post-viral autoimmune or inflammatory process and compressive myelopathy, which showed multilevel T2 hyperintense lesions in the thoracic spine with no evidence of compression.

Thus, the presence of motor, sensory as well as autonomic dysfunction, bilateral involvement, reaching a nadir in 4 days with clearly delineated sensory level at T4, CSF pleocytosis and the MRI finding without evidence of compression lead us to the diagnosis of transverse myelitis.

### Progressive ascending myelopathy: atypical forms of multiple sclerosis or what else? [^112hFFVE]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

The spinal cord can be affected by multiple heterogeneous disorders often difficult to diagnose. We describe ten patients affected by a progressive ascending myelopathy with a poor prognosis. The patients, during the follow-up period, underwent neurological examinations, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, hematological, microbiological, auto-antibodies screening, brain and spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroneurophysiological study. At disease onset spinal cord MRI showed ≥ 1 myelopathic lesions extended for < 2 segments and then evidenced a progressive spinal cord atrophy without any new lesion. All patients showed an increase of the visual evoked potential P100 latency. All of them showed two or more clinical recurrences of myelitis and then, after a period ranging from 3 to 5 years from the disease onset, a progressive course. Five patients became unresponsive to intravenous high-dose steroid treatments and/or intravenous immunoglobulins and to any other therapeutic attempts, developed a progressive ascending myelopathy to tetraplegia and died from respiratory failure. The other five patients are in progressive phase of the disease with an initial involvement of the upper limbs and show mild cervical spinal cord atrophy at MRI, configuring the early stage of an ascending progressive myelopathy. In our opinion, the more suitable diagnosis is an atypical form of MS although is not possible to exclude a new nosological entity that could be included in the expanding range of spinal cord diseases.

### Fulminant spinal cord compression caused by postradiation inflammatory pseudotumor with rapid response to steroids: case report [^114gR3t8]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2016). Low credibility.

Radiation therapy continues to play an extremely valuable role in the treatment of malignancy. The effects of radiation therapy on normal tissue can present in a delayed fashion, resulting in localized damage with pseudomalignant transformation, producing a compressive effect on the spinal cord or exiting nerve roots. Infiltration of inflammatory cells and the subsequent fibrotic response can result in the development of an inflammatory pseudotumor (benign tumor-like lesion) with subsequent mass effect. Herein, the authors present a rare case of inflammatory pseudotumor with fulminant cervicothoracic cord compression, developing 7 years after radiation therapy for breast cancer. The lesion recurred following resection but subsequently displayed complete and rapid resolution following steroid therapy. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no previous studies have reported such an incident.

At admission, there was concern for an infective meningoencephalitis given the preponderance of constitutional symptoms. The patient was empirically started on broad antimicrobial coverage with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, metronidazole, acyclovir, fluconazole, RIPE (rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol) and steroids (dexamethasone 8 mg every 6 hours as part of RIPE). RIPE and antifungal treatments were chosen due to concern for an atypical bacterial or fungal infection given the subacute presentation and CSF profile. The patient's fever and confusion improved with RIPE and dexamethasone, which led to a working diagnosis of MTB encephalomyelitis (despite negative MTB studies). However, his weakness continued to progress and began to involve the upper extremities. His lower extremities further declined to 2–3/5 strength, and he developed significant sensory loss throughout. Repeat spine imaging (eleven days after initiation of RIPE and dexamethasone) showed longitudinally extensive patchy T2 hyperintense signal throughout the central grey and lateral columns of the cervical and thoracic spine (figure 1). In the absence of an identifiable infection, he was started on pulse dose steroids with methylprednisolone 1000 mg intravenously daily for 5 days, followed by solumedrol 60 mg intravenously daily (in place of the RIPE associated dexamethasone). With this treatment he had no further clinical decline, however, his lower extremity weakness remained unchanged. Several days later, the Mayo Clinic CSF autoimmune encephalitis panel returned positive for GFAP 1:128 (ref < 1:2) confirming a diagnosis of meningomyeloencephalitis due to GFAP astrocytopathy. At this point, antimicrobials were stopped, and he underwent five sessions of plasmapheresis. Two weeks after the second MRI, he had clinical and radiologic improvement (figure 1).

### Diagnostic tests for low back disorders [^111hkiix]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for radicular symptoms — MRI is not recommended for acute radicular pain syndromes in the first 6 weeks unless the problems are severe and not trending towards improvement assuming the MRI confirms a nerve root compression consistent with clinical examination and surgery is being considered. Repeat MRI imaging without significant clinical change in symptoms and/or signs is also not recommended (Moderately Not Recommended (B), Moderate Confidence). For subacute or chronic radicular pain, MRI is moderately recommended when symptoms last at least 4 to 6 weeks without improvement and prompt surgery is being considered, and MRI at 3 to 4 weeks (before the epidural steroid injection) may be reasonable (Moderately Recommended (B), Moderate Confidence).

### Evaluation and management of longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis: a guide for radiologists [^114FBVKu]. Clinical Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Longitudinal extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) is defined as an intramedullary spinal cord T2 signal abnormality extending craniocaudally over at least three vertebral bodies on an MRI study. Timely and appropriate diagnosis greatly facilitates patient management. The radiologist should review the relevant clinical information and determine the patient demographics and acuity of symptoms. Herein, we review the spectrum of diseases causing LETM and propose interpretation to guide the radiologist when presented with the MRI finding of LETM.

### Diagnostic approach to intrinsic abnormality of spinal cord signal intensity [^111L61mc]. Radiographics (2019). Medium credibility.

Intramedullary cord hyperintensity at T2-weighted MRI is a common imaging feature of disease in the spinal cord, but it is nonspecific. Radiologists play a valuable role in helping narrow the differential diagnosis by integrating patient history and laboratory test results with key imaging characteristics. The authors present an algorithmic approach to evaluating intrinsic abnormality of spinal cord signal intensity (SI), which incorporates clinical evaluation results, time of onset (acute vs nonacute), cord expansion, and pattern of T2 SI abnormality. This diagnostic approach provides a practical framework to aid both trainees and practicing radiologists in workup of myelopathy. © RSNA, 2019.

### Location, length, and enhancement: systematic approach to differentiating intramedullary spinal cord lesions [^111bD2U6]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

As seen, there are myriad causes of abnormal signal within the spinal cord; demyelinating, metabolic, neoplastic, and vascular aetiologies must be considered when evaluating an abnormal cord. Although intramedullary spinal cord pathology can be a challenge, a systematic approach to imaging interpretation of these conditions focused on the length, location, and pattern of enhancement can greatly narrow the differential diagnosis, if not arrive at the correct diagnosis. This will not only add value to the care of the patient, but has the potential to prevent the use of more invasive methods of diagnosis.

MRI is the preferred examination for further characterization of the majority of these conditions. These include traumatic, inflammatory, infections, compressive and neoplastic conditions. This article provides an overview of a variety of pathologies that afflict the spinal cord in an easy to understand format. Their respective imaging manifestations on MRI and differential diagnoses are focused in this review.

In our patient, the presence of a longitudinal extensive transverse myelitis with subsequent worsening along with development of a necrotic area, associated with focal swelling, peripheral enhancement, and hypointense foci on T2 images, led us to the diagnosis of ANM in a patient COVID-19 positive. Immunomodulatory treatment such as steroids or plasmapheresis can result in neurologic improvement as the patient reported here.

Additional studies are needed to better define the potential role of human coronaviruses in the pathogenesis and the effectiveness of any therapeutic measure in the management of ANM.

### Reversible paraspinal muscle hyperintensity in anti-MOG antibody-associated transverse myelitis [^116hwdXQ]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion.

This young woman had anti-MOG–IgG–associated longitudinal extensive transverse myelitis accompanied by striking paraspinal muscle signal changes on MRI that extended from cervical to lumbar regions. These lesions were asymptomatic, did not involve subcutaneous tissue (ruling out injury from external causes), and were not present in other groups of muscles screened. The muscle abnormality was maximally seen in cervical and upper dorsal regions, corresponding to the sites of maximal cord abnormality. It completely disappeared with resolution of spinal cord lesions. The hyperintense signals seen in paraspinal muscles on T2 turbo inversion recovery magnitude (TIRM) sequences suggested muscle edema, and the contrast enhancement was in keeping with an inflammatory muscle disease. However, MOG is a myelin protein solely expressed at the outermost surface of myelin sheaths and oligodendrocyte membranes. Besides, a primary/concommitant muscle disease selectively involving paraspinal muscles was unlikely.

Involvement of extraneural tissue has been described previously in anti-MOG-IgG–associated disease. Perineural enhancement that extended into the orbital soft tissue surrounding inflammed optic nerve segments has been reported in patients with anti-MOG-IgG–related optic neuritis. These changes were seen before receiving steroids and particularly in the first attack of optic neuritis. Our patient's findings may be of similar nature, involving paraspinal muscles adjoining affected spinal cord segments. It is possible that the selective and transient involvement of paraspinal muscles is causally linked with the spinal cord inflammation. Alternatively, we hypothesize that a parallel (second) antibody with a different target and possibly affecting vascular permeability may be involved.

Our current understanding of the spectrum of anti-MOG–IgG–associated disorders is limited, and larger cohorts are needed to fully understand the spectrum of clinical and radiologic manifestations of these disorders.

ADEM disease was suspected, and high-dose steroids (IV methylprednisolone 1 g/d for 5 days tapered with oral prednisone 75 mg/d) associated with IV immunoglobulins (2 g/kg in 5 days) were administered. The patient reported significant improvement in visual symptoms and progressive recovery of visual acuity. After 14 days of treatment, vision was 20/30 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye. Visual-evoked potential showed increased latency in both eyes (p100 wave latency: 114 ms right eye, 120 ms left eye, reference: < 100 ms). A follow-up brain MRI scan also showed a partial improvement with a reduction in the number of Gd-enhancing lesions. On April 27, the patient was discharged with oral prednisone tapering.

### MRI activity in MS and completed pregnancy: data from a tertiary academic center [^117BRckY]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Cohort 1: PC

MS clinical history was extracted from medical records, including disease duration and MS type at conception, EDSS score at each visit, DMT use before and after pregnancy, and the number of clinical relapses (in the year before pregnancy, during pregnancy, and in the 12 months after delivery). We also collected data on treatment with monthly IV steroids (given in lieu of DMT postpartum) and maternal breastfeeding status in the 12 months postpartum.

There are many factors that contribute to a woman's decision to breastfeed or resume DMT postpartum. During our study period, breastfeeding women were strongly advised to not take DMTs. We confirmed that none of the breastfeeding women were on DMT at the time of postpartum MRI. We also confirmed specific DMT exposures for nonbreastfeeding subjects. Breastfeeding status was assumed to be nonexclusive unless specifically noted in the medical records. We did not have precise data on the timing of discontinuing DMTs before conception or restarting DMTs in relationship to breastfeeding discontinuation.

Reports and images of the brain and cervical and thoracic spine MRI scans were reviewed. All but 2 neuroimaging scans were performed at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and included assessment for the presence of new T2-weighted hyperintense lesions relative to previous MRI and gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions when contrast was administered. The study PI (M.H.) reviewed all images when reports indicated new T2 or Gd+ lesions for confirmation of findings. Lesion counts were not formally performed, but the results were categorized based on the number of new T2 of Gd+ lesions indicated in the neuroradiology report (none, 1, 2, or greater than 2; figure).

### Spinal-cord MRI in multiple sclerosis [^111H7exD]. The Lancet: Neurology (2003). Medium credibility.

The potential of MRI of the spinal cord as a diagnostic tool in MS has recently gained much interest. Dual echo spin echo MRI is most sensitive for the detection of spinal-cord abnormalities, which range from multiple focal lesions to confluent areas of high signal intensity. In some patients, commonly those with primary progressive disease, diffuse areas of slightly increased signal intensity are found. Disappointingly, the relation between MRI findings and clinical disability is weak. Studies relating MRI findings with histopathology have revealed substantial axonal loss in the spinal cords of patients with MS, whether focal lesions are present of not. Further, diffuse cord atrophy is found in advanced MS, which may reflect axonal loss. In the diagnostic setting, spinal-cord imaging is valuable. First, asymptomatic spinal-cord lesions are very rare in disorders other than MS. For example, in a patient with equivocal brain findings such as an elderly patient with vascular-ischaemic lesions, a normal spinal-cord examination can help rule out MS. Second, presence of asymptomatic spinal lesions may help confirm a diagnosis of MS when few or no brain lesions are present.

### Radiation myelopathy of the cervical spine in the setting of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder after low-dose radiation therapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the cervical lymph nodes [^1166R38V]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The spinal cord, as a late-responding tissue, is a relatively radiosensitive structure. Radiation myelopathy (RM) is a very rare but potentially catastrophic complication. RM is defined as damage of the white matter of the spinal cord after exposure to ionizing radiation. Glial and vascular damage from radiation likely both contribute to this pathophysiology. It is often a diagnosis of exclusion based on a history of prior radiation of sufficient dose to cause cord injury, the region of irradiated cord being superior to the region of symptoms, presence of a latency period from completion of treatment, and a lack of explanatory disease progression. Its irreversible form often presents around 6 months posttreatment. Characteristic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings include T2 hyperintensity, contrast enhancement, and sometimes cord edema. There is no well-established treatment for RM, although trial of steroids is reasonable. Supportive care is indicated.

As a deterministic radiation effect, the risk and severity of RM is affected by radiation dose, with probability of RM estimated at < 1%, 5%, and 50% at doses of 50, 60, and 70 Gy, respectively. Owing to low α/β of approximately 0.87, larger fraction sizes also increase risk of RM. Given the serial arrangement of the functional subunits of the spinal cord, high point doses are sufficient to cause RM. Furthermore, the lethality of RM increases with more proximal lesions, up to 70% mortality from cervical lesions and 30% with thoracic lesions. Prior existing conditions or prior therapies can contribute to the risk of RM. History of prior central nervous system (CNS) disease or injury, in addition to comorbidities such as hypertension, hypotension, diabetes, or vascular disease, can increase susceptibility to RM. In cases of prior radiation, the prior total dose, cumulative dose of all courses, and the time interval between courses all have critical implications as well. Rare reports have also indicated that the dose threshold for RM in patients receiving prior chemotherapy or immunotherapy may be lowered.

### MRI findings in acute idiopathic transverse myelopathy in children [^112V49Qq]. Pediatric Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the clinical and MRI findings in three children with acute idiopathic myelopathy (AIM).

Materials and Methods

Retrospective review of the clinical presentation, MRI findings and outcome of three patients diagnosed with acute idiopathic transverse myelitis.

Results

Of note was the swift onset of symptoms in all patients, without any preceding illness or history of vaccination in two of the patients, and the rapid resolution of symptoms on steroid therapy in all the patients. MRI showed T2-weighted hyperintensity and patchy enhancement with gadolinium, but the extensive cord involvement did not correlate with the severity of presentation or outcome.

Conclusions

Our findings do not support that MRI evidence alone of diffuse myelopathy is a predictor of poor outcome in childhood AIM.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Features of Some Patients

A, A patient with Crohn disease for 3 years who was treated with adalimumab for 10 years presented with a thoracic sensory band and lower-limb paresthesia. The patient had a cervical spine MRI that revealed multiple short-segment T2 hyperintense lesions with contrast enhancement. The diagnosis was central nervous system (CNS) demyelination. B, A patient with a history of rheumatoid arthritis who was treated with adalimumab for 16 years presented with headaches and a generalized tonic-clonic seizure; an infectious and malignant neoplasm evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) had a negative result. Dural biopsy results revealed necrotizing meningitis, and were negative for special stains for microorganisms, including mycobacteria and fungi. The diagnosis was idiopathic lepto-pachymeningitis. C, A patient with ankylosing spondylitis and type 1 diabetes was treated with several tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors for a cumulative total of 2 years (infliximab twice, etanercept, and adalimumab). The patient had ceased using TNF inhibitor 10 months before presenting with acute confusion. The CSF analysis and positron emission tomography (PET) scan had a negative result for neural antibodies and malignant neoplasm. Serum autoimmune neural antibodies had a positive result (serum acetylcholine receptor modulating antibody, 34% loss; GAD65 antibody, 0.35 nmol/L; striational antibody, 1:240). The diagnosis was autoimmune encephalitis. The patient had a clinically robust response to intravenous methylprednisolone acetate. D, A patient with Crohn disease for 10 years was treated with adalimumab for 6 months, then infliximab for 6 months before presenting with new-onset headaches, hearing loss, paresthesias, left facial droop, numbness and diplopia. In addition to a brain MRI scan showing leptomeningeal enhancement of the brainstem, an MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine also revealed patchy leptomeningeal enhancement of the spinal cord. Results of an infectious and neoplastic evaluation of the CSF were negative. A PET scan identified increased fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the mediastinum, and a biopsy of subcarinal lymph node confirmed granulomatous disease. Special stains for microorganisms, including mycobacteria and fungi, had a negative result. The diagnosis was neurosarcoidosis. E, A patient with rheumatoid arthritis for 8 years who was treated with etanercept and methotrexate sodium presented with new-onset headaches and paresthesia of the right face and limbs. A right frontal biopsy specimen demonstrated necrotizing granulomatous inflammation that extensively involved the leptomeninges. Special stains for microorganisms, including mycobacteria and fungi, had a negative result. The diagnosis was neurosarcoidosis. F, A patient with a history of Crohn disease who was treated with infliximab for 3 years presented with myelopathic symptoms. A PET scan showed moderately intense FDG activity in the thoracic spinal cord. A thoracic cord biopsy demonstrated necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. Special stains for microorganisms, including mycobacteria and fungi, had a negative result. The diagnosis was neurosarcoidosis. FLAIR indicates fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence.

### Intramedullary cervical spinal cord sarcoidosis [^11192GSh]. Spinal Cord (2009). Low credibility.

Study Design

Case report.

Objective

To report on an uncommon patient of cervical spinal cord sarcoidosis.

Setting

New York, USA.

Methods

A 47-year-old man was evaluated for heaviness of his legs, difficulty walking and numbness of arms and feet for 6 months. Contrast enhanced MRI scan showed a strongly enhancing nodular lesion, suggestive of a spinal cord tumor, which was initially considered for neurosurgical biopsy and treatment. Investigations unexpectedly revealed mediastinal lymphadenopathy and elevated angiotensin converting enzyme levels and the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was confirmed by a transbronchial lung biopsy.

Result

Prompt treatment with steroids resulted in complete clinical and radiological resolution of the spinal cord lesion within 4 weeks. This improvement was maintained over a 18 month follow-up period.

Conclusion

Isolated spinal cord intramedullary enhancing lesions, even when the appearance is suggestive of a tumor, should be rigorously investigated for sarcoidosis and a trial of steroid therapy considered to avoid unnecessary surgery.

Results

During a 5.5-year period, 33 DAVF were identified affecting the spinal cord. Twenty-seven were spinal DAVF (cervical, thoracic, lumbar). Six were intracranial Cognard type V DAVF. The clinical, CSF, MRI and angiographic findings are summarised in Table 1. Steroids were administered more frequently for presumed ATM with Cognard type V DAVF (5/6) compared to spinal (1/27, cervical) DAVF (p = 0.0001, Fisher exact test).

Summary of the clinical, CSF, MRI and angiographic findings for each case

*Flow voids were visible on the initial MRI of case 3 but were missed at his first presentation and only identified when he re-presented 3 months later

** Flow voids were visible on the initial MRI of case 5 but were falsely attributed to his previous history of an intramedullary cavernoma at C7/T1 treated surgically 9 years prior

Abbreviations: IV, intravenous; mRS, modified Rankin score; N, normal; H, high; CMJ, cervicomedullary junction; PMJ, pontomedullary junction; DSA, digital subtraction angiogram

Clinical findings

All Cognard type V DAVF patients were males in their 7th decade with a symptom duration of 1–8 months. Acute or hyperacute deterioration was observed in 4/6 cases. Clinical deterioration after steroid treatment occurred in 4/5 cases. Case 5 developed bulbar and respiratory failure 4 h after receiving steroids. Case 3 initially improved following steroids but deteriorated acutely 3 months later.

MRI and CSF findings

Figure 1 shows the initial MRI of each case. Figure 2 comprises a selection of angiography images from cases 1–3. Five cases demonstrated longitudinally extensive intramedullary T2-hyperintensity with cord expansion. One patient had isolated brainstem oedema (Fig. 1.2). Intramedullary gadolinium enhancement was present in 2/6 cases (Fig. 1.4b, 6b). Dilated perimedullary veins were visible in 3/6 cases but were recognised only on specialist neuroradiology review. Perimedullary veins were visible as flow voids on T2-weighted sequences in two cases (Fig. 1.3, 5) but only on the gadolinium-enhanced T1-sequence of case 2 (not shown). CSF was obtained in 5 cases; white cell count was normal but 4/5 had elevated CSF protein levels (range 30–120 mg/dL, reference range 15–40 mg/dL).

### A practical approach to the diagnosis of spinal cord lesions [^112enyXP]. Practical Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Every neurologist will be familiar with the patient with atypical spinal cord disease and the challenges of taking the diagnosis forward. This is predominantly because of the limited range of possible clinical and investigation findings making most individual features non-specific. The difficulty in obtaining a tissue diagnosis further contributes and patients are often treated empirically based on local prevalence and potential for reversibility. This article focuses on improving the diagnosis of adult non-traumatic, non-compressive spinal cord disorders. It is structured to start with the clinical presentation in order to be of practical use to the clinician. We aim, by combining the onset phenotype with the subsequent course, along with imaging and laboratory features, to improve the diagnostic process.

### Acute flaccid myelitis among children-Washington, September-November 2016 [^116aDoZm]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

All patients initially had acute onset of weakness in one or more limbs. At the peak of neurologic symptoms, eight patients had more than one involved limb, two had three involved limbs, and four patients had all limbs involved. Other neurologic signs included acute neck weakness (one patient), bladder or bowel incontinence (five patients), and cranial nerve dysfunction, including facial weakness or diplopia (three patients). The severity of symptoms in one patient limited parts of the neurologic examination that require patient participation; this patient also required ventilator support. The median duration of hospitalization was 7 days (range = 4–35 days). Four patients received intravenous immunoglobulin and eight patients received intravenous steroids with an oral taper. Seven patients underwent rehabilitation therapy, four as inpatients and three as outpatients. Among nine patients for whom follow-up information was available 1.5–3 months after discharge, five had mild to no residual deficits, three had moderate improvement with residual limb weakness, and one had moderate improvement, but was not ambulatory without assistance. No deaths among confirmed cases occurred.

CSF collection was attempted in all patients; however, contamination with blood rendered one patient's sample uninterpretable. Seven of nine patients had pleocytosis (median = 163 cells/mm 3; range = 13–395 cells/mm 3; reference = 0–5 cells/mm 3). CSF protein range was 19–99 mg/dL (median = 57.5 mg/dL; reference < 40 mg/dL). Nine patients received an MRI of the full spinal cord, and one patient received an MRI of the cervical and upper thoracic region. All patients received a brain MRI. All patients had lesions at the cervical cord level; nine patients had thoracic cord lesions and five patients had lesions at the conus medullaris level (termination of the spinal cord at approximately lumbar [L1/L2]). No MRI reports noted enhancement of the cauda equina (nerve roots descending below the end of the termination of the spinal cord) in any patient. Two patients had supratentorial (the region of the brain containing the cerebrum) lesions, one had subcortical lesions, and three had brainstem lesions. Lesions were predominantly confined to the gray matter in nine patients and to the gray and white matter in one patient. Lesions in two patients displayed enhancement with contrast media, which was used in all patients.

### Location, length, and enhancement: systematic approach to differentiating intramedullary spinal cord lesions [^11189Cos]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

HIV myelopathy

HIV myelopathy is a late-onset complication of HIV (Fig. 10). Patients present with insidious onset myelopathy with lower extremity weakness and sensory abnormalities, impotence, and/or urinary symptoms. On MRI, spinal cord atrophy is typically present. Other findings can be seen, including symmetric dorsal column hyperintensity on T2-weighted images similar to subacute combined degeneration, though typically the signal abnormality is limited to the thoracic spine. The cervical spine is involved less commonly. On histology, there is vacuolization of the myelin-forming cells of the spinal cord.

### Spinal cord MRI in multiple sclerosis – diagnostic, prognostic and clinical value [^112Qphxr]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disorder of the CNS that affects both the brain and the spinal cord. MRI studies in MS focus more often on the brain than on the spinal cord, owing to the technical challenges in imaging this smaller, mobile structure. However, spinal cord abnormalities at disease onset have important implications for diagnosis and prognosis. Furthermore, later in the disease course, in progressive MS, myelopathy becomes the primary characteristic of the clinical presentation, and extensive spinal cord pathology — including atrophy, diffuse abnormalities and numerous focal lesions — is common. Recent spinal cord imaging studies have employed increasingly sophisticated techniques to improve detection and quantification of spinal cord lesions, and to elucidate their relationship with physical disability. Quantitative MRI measures of cord size and tissue integrity could be more sensitive to the axonal loss and other pathological processes in the spinal cord than is conventional MRI, putting quantitative MRI in a key role to elucidate the association between disability and spinal cord abnormalities seen in people with MS. In this Review, we summarize the most recent MS spinal cord imaging studies and discuss the new insights they have provided into the mechanisms of neurological impairment. Finally, we suggest directions for further and future research.

### Idiopathic acute transverse myelitis in a middle-aged woman with progression to nadir in less than one hour [^115m8e83]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

We report a case of a middle-aged woman, normally fit and well, presenting with acute onset neurological deficit with progression to nadir in < 1 hour. Initial MRI spine showed no significant abnormality, although second MRI spine showed abnormal signal in three to four segments with no compressive lesion. CT aortic angiography excluded vascular or ischaemic abnormality. We made a diagnosis of idiopathic acute transverse myelitis (ATM). She was treated with steroids and made significant progress improving from T11 ASIA A paraplegia to T11 ASIA C paraplegia by the time of discharge. Awareness of idiopathic ATM presenting hyperacutely with initial MRI spine being normal is important for prompt diagnosis and management.

Figure 2
Magnetic resonance imaging upon initial presentation (T2 [A] and T1 postcontrast [B] images) and at relapse of neurologic symptoms (T2 [C] and T1 postcontrast [D] images), demonstrating abnormal signal and enhancement in the cervical spinal cord.

She spent 1 month in rehabilitation, regaining ability to walk without difficulty and with a full symptomatic recovery noted at clinical follow-up around 4 months from initial presentation. A follow-up MRI of the brain and spine at that time demonstrated significant improvement of T2 hyperintensities in the cervical cord, with residual increased signal extending from the cervical medullary junction to the level of C7. Additionally, there was noted to be less swelling and edema of the spinal cord, and no enhancement was noted.

Approximately 8 months from initial neurologic presentation, the patient had recurrence of symptoms. She was again admitted for evaluation, and MRI of the brain and spine again demonstrated abnormal signal and enhancement in the cervical spine (Fig. 2 C and 2D). Repeat PET demonstrated no evidence of hypermetabolic lesions. However, at this time, NMO immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were checked and detected in the serum, thus establishing diagnosis of NMOSD. The case was again reviewed by radiation oncology and during interdisciplinary tumor board. Despite diagnosis of NMOSD, a component of RM could not be excluded.

Intravenous steroids were started and tapered. She subsequently received plasmapheresis treatments and rituximab maintenance therapy for NMOSD resulting in stabilization of symptoms. As of the present time, approximately 28 months from initial presentation, she continues to have stable symptoms with bilateral upper extremity weakness (4 out of 5).

### Thoracic spinal cord lesions are influenced by the degree of cervical spine involvement in multiple sclerosis [^1133gb6Q]. Spinal Cord (2015). Low credibility.

Study Design

Cross-sectional analyses.

Objective

To determine whether cervical spinal cord lesions predict the presence of thoracic cord lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.

Setting

Single MS Clinic, AZ, USA.

Methods

All MS patients, with MRI studies of the brain, cervical and thoracic spine obtained during a single scanning session, were acquired during a 1-year period. Clinical, demographic and imaging covariates were used in a multivariate regression model to refine predictors of thoracic cord involvement.

Results

A total of 687 patients were evaluated, and patients were excluded because of a diagnosis of other neurological disorders, not meeting the 2010 McDonald criteria for MS (n = 222) or incomplete neuraxis imaging (n = 339). The study cohort comprised 126 patients. There was an increase in the odds ratio (OR) of thoracic spine involvement when any cervical spine lesion was present (OR = 6.08, 95% confidence interval (2.21–16.68), P < 0.001). The multivariate logistic regression model demonstrated a substantial and significant increase in the odds of thoracic spine involvement when more than two cervical spine lesions were present, two lesions (OR 4.44, (0.91–21.60), P = 0.06), three lesions (OR 19.76, (3.51–111.17), P = 0.001), four or more lesions (OR 20.49, (1.97–213.23), P = 0.012) and diffuse lesions (OR 71.94, (5.28–979.88), P = 0.001), when adjusting for significant covariates including clinical symptoms, brain lesions, disease duration and treatment exposure.

Conclusions

Thoracic spinal cord lesions appear to be predicated on the degree of cervical spine involvement in patients with MS, a risk that appears to be independent of brain findings or clinical features.

### Imaging approach to myelopathies [^113sTiEc]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Myelopathy refers to spinal cord involvement from diverse etiologies resulting in neurologic symptoms. The presentation is variable, often posing a diagnostic challenge due to overlapping clinical and imaging features. Classification by symptom onset aids in the differential diagnosis and is based on hyperacute, acute/subacute, and chronic presentations, each carrying distinct prognoses. MR imaging is pivotal for diagnosis, providing detailed characterization of spinal cord involvement. This article offers a comprehensive overview of various diseases causing myelopathy, their imaging manifestations, differential diagnoses, and diagnostic algorithms, emphasizing the role of MR imaging in facilitating prompt identification of underlying causes and guiding optimal management.

Brain and Spinal Cord MRI

No typical MS-like brain lesion was detected in any patient despite repeat examination (median [range] number of brain MRI examinations per patient 4 [2–9]) (Figure 2). Importantly, 3D fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging was available for 15 of 18 patients. A median of 5 (2–6) spinal cord MRI examinations were performed per patient. All spinal cord MRI examinations included sagittal T2/STIR sequences. At least 1 series of axial sequences was available for 8 of 18 patients. Spinal cord MRI demonstrated a median (range) number of 2 (1–5) lesions per examination and a median (range) number of 3 (1–7) lesions on the last examination. The median (range) sagittal extension of the spinal cord lesions was 1 (0.5–2) vertebral segments. Among all spinal cord lesions (n = 67) depicted, 37 (55%) and 30 (45%) involved the cervical and thoracolumbar levels, respectively. Gadolinium injection was performed in 45 examinations, and 21 of 46 (45%) lesions showed gadolinium enhancement. Overall, 18 lesions in 9 patients were explored on the axial plane, and 12 (67%) showed partial myelitis (Figure 3).

MRI technique and timing after cord trauma — Consider MRI in consultation with the spine surgeon for MDCT findings suggestive of neurologic involvement and of gross neurologic deficits, and include both T2-weighted images and gradient echo images in the MRI examination of the thoracic or lumbar portions of the spine. In the subacute and chronic stages after cord trauma, MRI can help define the extent of cord injury, which is particularly important in patients who suffer late deterioration, sometimes caused by treatable etiologies such as development or enlargement of intramedullary cavities.

with very bright T2-hyperintensity and associated T1-hypointensity seen longer than 1 month after SCI; anterior pencil-like hyperintensity with associated anteromedial T2-hyperintensity; anterior U/V with associated anterior pencil-like hyperintensity on sagittal view; hologrey pattern with associated edematous T2-hyperintensity on sagittal view; and holocord pattern with associated edematous T2-hypertensity extending through the conus on sagittal view. Sensory loss occurred in 126 patients, selectively affecting pain/temperature in 49. Initial magnetic resonance imaging spine results were normal in 30 patients. Characteristic MRI T2-hyperintense patterns included owl eyes and pencil-like hyperintensity; gadolinium enhancement was often linear and located in the anterior gray matter.

Subsequent imaging revealed T2-hyperintense cord lesions; 3 of these patients had acute DWI/apparent diffusion coefficient imaging, and 1 demonstrated restriction. The lesion axial localization and imaging pattern varied over the length of the lesion; a single infarct could have multiple patterns. Immunotherapy was used for a suspected immune-mediated condition in 74 patients: corticosteroids, 71; intravenous immunoglobulin, 16; plasma exchange, 12; azathioprine, 1; mycophenolate mofetil, 1; and rituximab, 1. Blood pressure augmentation was used in 9, lumbar drain in 8, and intravenous tissue plasminogen activator was administered to 2 patients. Anticoagulation was initiated in 11 patients, and at least 1 antiplatelet agent was used in 92 patients. Other treatments for suspected alternative diagnoses included spinal decompression, 3; cardiac stent placement, 1; and epidural corticosteroid injection for radiculopathy, 1.

Empirical intravenous methylprednisolone treatment is reasonable when concern remains for a possible inflammatory myelopathy. However, some treatments, such as plasma exchange 27–29 and intravenous immunoglobulin, 30–32 could be harmful and should be avoided.

### Differentiating primary angiitis of the central nervous system from paraneoplastic neurological syndrome [^116MBb2i]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

In this clinical case, the differential diagnosis was extensive due to diverse neurological symptoms. Initial considerations included CNS lymphoma, which was suspected due to elevated B lymphocytes in CSF flow cytometry and the patient's history of malignancy. However, blood flow cytometry showed no systemic lymphoproliferative disorder. The second consideration was PNS based on the patient's oncological background, but onconeural antibodies were negative. Multiple sclerosis (MS) was one of the differential diagnoses because of demyelinating changes in MRI but was inconsistent with other findings. Vasculitis and infections were ruled out through serological tests, CSF analysis and lack of systemic inflammatory markers. Brain biopsy ultimately confirmed PACNS.

Imaging in this case helped to rule out the significant differential diagnoses. MS is typically seen with well-defined periventricular lesions oriented perpendicular to the ventricles (Dawson's fingers), corpus callosum thinning and spinal cord involvement — all of which were absent. CNS lymphoma usually presents as homogeneously enhancing deep periventricular masses or ring-enhancing lesions with restricted diffusion, but the lesions here were ill-defined, non-mass-like and only subtly contrast-enhancing. PNS can mimic demyelinating processes but spare the corpus callosum and optic nerves; moreover, the negative paraneoplastic antibody panel and lack of spinal cord (figure 4) involvement made this diagnosis less likely. Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) and Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) were excluded based on negative antibody status and absence of spinal cord lesions or longitudinal optic nerve involvement on MRI. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy also typically has asymmetric, subcortical T2 hyperintensities without enhancement or mass effect, and JC virus PCR in CSF was not performed as the clinical and radiological presentation was not suggestive. Bilateral, asymmetric, confluent white matter lesions with corpus callosum and corticospinal tract involvement, and ongoing progression on corticosteroids with no clear markers for other aetiologies, supported the diagnosis of PACNS — later confirmed on biopsy.

### Assessment of lesions on magnetic resonance imaging in multiple sclerosis: practical guidelines [^114GrHgF]. Brain (2019). Medium credibility.

Spinal cord lesions

Multiple sclerosis spinal cord lesions are often multiple and short in cranio-caudal diameter. They are hyperintense on T 2 -weighted sequences and may occur along the entire spinal cord (cervical, thoracic or lumbar), although the cervical portion is more frequently involved. To be confident that they are not artefacts, lesions should be identifiable on at least two sequences [T 2 plus short tau inversion recovery (STIR) or PD images] or in two planes.

Historically, two different types of spinal cord lesion have been described in patients with multiple sclerosis: discrete (focal) and those where diffuse abnormal areas of intermediate signal intensity lack a well-demarcated border. These signs are not incorporated into current multiple sclerosis diagnostic criteria because they are not sufficiently reliable and specific. Therefore, to be considered as supporting a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, spinal cord lesions should be focal, with clearly demarcated border, cigar-shaped on sagittal images, and wedge-shaped on axial images (Fig. 4 and Table 2).

### Reversible paraspinal muscle hyperintensity in anti-MOG antibody-associated transverse myelitis [^1157EfYW]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Methods.

Case.

A 22-year-old woman developed rapidly worsening paraplegia with urinary retention without any preceding illness. There was no myalgia or muscle tenderness at the time of examination. Routine investigations including erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and serum creatine phosphokinase were normal. Antinuclear antibody was negative. An MRI of the spine revealed longitudinally extensive myelitis involving the entire cord (figure, B). The posterior paraspinal muscles in relation to cervical, upper thoracic, and lumbar vertebrae showed hyperintense signals on T2TIRM (turbo inversion recovery magnitude) sequences with postcontrast (gadolinium) enhancement (figure, A–F). An MRI of the brain showed nonenhancing patchy lesions in the brain stem, cerebellum, bilateral frontal, and left temporal cortex (figure, G and H). Electrophysiologic examination (including F-wave studies and paraspinal muscle electromyography) was unremarkable. Cell-based assay for MOG IgG was positive (titer 1: 8,192, range 1: 128–1: 65536 2), while serum aquaporin 4 IgG was negative (assayswere performed at coauthors' laboratory in Japan). CSF examination was unremarkable except for a mild increase in protein (59 mg/dL; normal range 15–45 mg/dL), and oligoclonal bands were absent. Investigations including imaging were performed before treatment. Patient recovered completely after receiving IV methyl prednisolone for 5 days followed by an oral taper of prednisolone over 6 weeks. A repeat scan done after an interval of 3 months (figure, F–K) revealed a complete resolution of spinal cord lesions and paraspinal muscle hyperintensity. Currently, she remains well nearly 18 months after disease onset.

### Nontraumatic spinal cord compression: MRI primer for emergency department radiologists [^117Fg66p]. Radiographics (2019). Medium credibility.

The occurrence of acute myelopathy in a nontrauma setting constitutes a medical emergency for which spinal MRI is frequently ordered as the first step in the patient's workup. The emergency department radiologist should be familiar with the common differential diagnoses of acute myelopathy and be able to differentiate compressive from noncompressive causes. The degree of spinal cord compression and presence of an intramedullary T2-hyperintense signal suggestive of an acute cord edema are critical findings for subsequent urgent care such as surgical decompression. Importantly, a delay in diagnosis may lead to permanent disability. In the spinal canal, compressive myelopathy can be localized to the epidural, intradural extramedullary, or intramedullary anatomic spaces. Effacement of the epidural fat and the lesion's relation to the thecal sac help to distinguish an epidural lesion from an intradural lesion. Noncompressive myelopathy manifests as an intramedullary T2-hyperintense signal without an underlying mass and has a wide range of vascular, metabolic, inflammatory, infectious, and demyelinating causes with seemingly overlapping imaging appearances. The differential diagnosis can be refined by considering the location of the abnormal signal intensity within the cord, the longitudinal extent of the disease, and the clinical history and laboratory findings. Use of a compartmental spinal MRI approach in patients with suspected nontraumatic spinal cord injury helps to localize the abnormality to an epidural, intradural extramedullary, or intramedullary space, and when combined with clinical and laboratory findings, aids in refining the diagnosis and determining the appropriate surgical or nonsurgical management.

### Risk of multiple sclerosis in patients with psoriasis receiving anti-IL-17 agents: a case-based review [^112384kG]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

One month later, in November 2021 he experienced numbness of the left upper and both lower extremities. The patient was admitted to the Neurology Department for consultation. Neurological examination revealed mild congenital nystagmus and brisk tendon reflexes on the lower limbs. There was no family history of demyelinating diseases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated one hyperintense T2 lesion on the white matter of the left frontal lobe and four hyperintense T2 lesions on the cervical and thoracic spinal cord, some of which were enhanced by gadolinium (Gd‐DTPA), as shown in Figure 1. Oligoclonal bands were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid. These findings suggested a new onset demyelinating disease which was diagnosed as relapsing remitting MS (RRMS), according to the revised McDonald criteria of 2017.

FIGURE 1

Ixekizumab was discontinued. The patient was initially treated with intravenous steroids and clinical improvement was achieved. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) was initiated as treatment for both psoriasis and MS. Gradual improvement of the clinical manifestations was observed. On last follow up, 1 year after DMF initiation, there were no relapses and no further radiological deterioration.

MRIs of cervical and thoracic spine were performed 2 weeks later. MRI of thoracic spine revealed two small foci of increased T2 signal within thoracic cord at the T7 and T9 levels without contrast enhancement (figure 1B). MRI of cervical spine and spinal cord was normal (not shown).

The patient subsequently underwent intravenous methylprednisolone treatment (1 g daily for 5 days followed by a prednisone taper). Her vision returned to normal after 18 days and the remainder of her neurological examination at that time was also normal. There was no adverse environmental exposure present.

Patient B is a 20-year-old right-handed African-American woman. All developmental milestones were met. She has hypothyroidism and factor V Leiden homozygous. She denied any history of neurological symptoms suggestive of demyelinating disease.

Six weeks before her neurological evaluation, she began seeing 'things' before falling asleep. Her primary doctor felt it may be related to a urinary tract infection. She was started on antibiotics and the visual symptoms resolved after several days. She remained asymptomatic until 3 days prior to her neurological evaluation when she woke up with double vision. She denied any fever, headache, slurred speech, eye pain, blurred vision or any other symptoms. Her symptoms remained unchanged for 3 days. No exposure to COVID-19.

Metabolic work-up was remarkable for a thyroid-stimulating hormone of 0.05 (normal 0.3–5.0) and vitamin B 6 deficiency. Brain MRI was performed on the day of her neurology appointment. It demonstrated on T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintense signal abnormalities in the periaqueductal grey matter (figure 2A). MRI of cervical spine demonstrated non-enhancing T2 hyperintense signal abnormalities in the left hemi-cord at the levels of the C2, C5 and C6 vertebral body (figure 2B, C). MRI of thoracic spine was normal.

Figure 2
MRI evidence of myelitis and radiculitis in 6 patients

Patient A presents with concomitant presence of multiple and discontinuous T2 hyperintense lesions (A.a) that enhance on T1-weighted images after gadolinium injection (A.b) concomitantly with nerve roots of the cauda equina (A.b and A.c). Nerve root enhancement is prominent in 2 other patients (B.a, B.b, C.a, and C.b), with greater nerve root thickening in the latter (C.c). Two other patients had multifocal, discontinuous, T2-hyperintense lesions (D.a and E.a) as well as enhancement (D.b and E.b) in both the conus and lower thoracic cord. Finally, cord T2-hyperintense abnormality (F.a) may precede the onset of nerve root enhancement (F.b) by 26 days.

The median CSF white blood cell count in the Elsberg group was 9; 15 (50%) patients had more than 5 leukocytes/μL; the average percentage of lymphocytes was 69%; 2 patients had an average 65% mononuclear predominance. CSF proteins were consistently elevated (mean 143 ± 131 mg/dL), whereas oligoclonal bands were rarely detected (table 3).

ES was considered in the differential diagnosis of 3 (10%) patients. Acyclovir was administered in 6 (20%) patients and corticosteroids in 15 (50%) patients, typically methylprednisolone 1 g per day over 3–5 days. Follow-up data were available for 13 (43%) patients (table 4). One patient (3%) died with encephalomyelitis and cardiac arrest; 3 patients (10%) had no neurologic recovery; 8 moderate recovery (27%); and 1 complete recovery (3%). Only 2 patients (7%) relapsed, one at 33 and the other at 82 months from onset.

### Location, length, and enhancement: systematic approach to differentiating intramedullary spinal cord lesions [^1149ADKt]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Infarct

Spinal cord infarctions occur very rarely, accounting for less than 1% of strokes. However, appropriate diagnosis of this entity is critical, as its symptoms overlap with other causes of myelopathy, such as demyelinating processes. There are many underlying aetiologies of spinal cord infarction, and they are classified according to the transverse involvement of the cord, which corresponds to the insulted vascular territory. MRI is the gold standard for diagnosis. All cases involve a long segment of the cord, and the majority of infarcts will involve the anterior spinal artery, resulting in anterior or central cord involvement (Fig. 22).

### Eosinophilic vasculitis of the spinal cord associated with Churg-Strauss syndrome [^111Yojpu]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2010). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic vasculitis has been described as part of Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS), but it also affects the central nervous system in < 10% of cases. However, spinal cord involvement in CSS has not been reported. We report a patient with myelopathic symptoms, with a two-year history of asthma. Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis, with 31.7% eosinophils. A chest computed tomographic scan and radiography showed patchy bilateral areas of consolidation, predominantly involving the peripheral regions of the lower lobes. Spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed high-signal-intensity lesions at the C3-C5 and T1-T4 spinal levels on T2-weighted images. A microscopic evaluation revealed an eosinophil-rich inflammatory infiltrate with fibroid necrosis of a vessel wall, and granuloma formation in the small veins was not clearly visible. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of eosinophilic vasculitis of the spinal cord associated with CSS, and the patient responded well to steroids.

### Susac syndrome with a unique involvement of the thoracic spinal cord [^115pxuWq]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

A woman in her late 20s presented with headaches and subacute encephalopathy. MRIs showed multiple punctate subcortical and periventricular white matter hyperintensities with diffusion restriction, infratentorial lesions, leptomeningeal enhancement of the cervical spinal cord, brainstem and cerebellum and two areas of high-signal abnormality at T4 and T6 raising suspicion for multiple sclerosis or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Further studies and evolution of her symptoms during her hospital stay confirmed the clinical triad of encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusions and hearing loss pathognomonic for Susac's syndrome. While cervical spinal cord and cauda equina involvement have been reported in Susac's syndrome previously, no thoracic spinal cord involvement has been reported. We report the novel MRI finding of thoracic spinal cord involvement in Susac's syndrome. In order to avoid misdiagnosis, neurologists and neuroradiologists should be aware that any part of the spinal cord can be involved in Susac's syndrome.

### Nitrous oxide-induced subacute combined degeneration of the cord: diagnosis and treatment [^116bE2z2]. Practical Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

MRI

MR scans of the cervical and thoracic cord may both confirm the diagnosis and exclude alternative causes. In 50%–100% of patients with N 2 O-SACD, MRI shows dorsal column T2 hyperintensity in the cervical spinal cord with C3–C5 most commonly affected (figure 2B). Axial slices are particularly useful to see the classical 'inverted V' or 'rabbit ears' sign (figure 2A).

Figure 2
Classical MRI findings in nitrous oxide-induced subacute combined degeneration of the cord. The T2 axial image (A) shows hyperintense signal in the dorsal columns of the cervical spinal cord, creating an 'inverted V' sign. The sagittal image (B) shows the commonly found pattern of hyperintensity extending longitudinally over several cervical spinal segments.

Given the currently high prevalence of N 2 O use, clinicians should be aware that N 2 O users may have an alternative cause for a spinal cord syndrome, including inflammatory processes, cervical cord compression and hereditary syndromes. MRI is particularly useful to look for these other causes, since each has a distinct MRI appearance (described elsewhere). However, N 2 O-SACD cannot be distinguished solely by imaging, as several other conditions exactly share its MRI findings; these include myelopathy caused by HIV infection, copper deficiency, vitamin E deficiency and methotrexate toxicity.MRI also cannot differentiate traditional SACD from N 2 O-SACD, although N 2 O-SACD may have less involvement of the thoracic cord, wider lesions on sagittal MRI, fewer spinal segments with lesions and a higher rate of the inverted V sign.

We request MRI of the cervical cord on most patients with suspected N 2 O-SACD. The exception is for patients with a very clear history of recently heavy N 2 O use and mild symptoms that resolve with B 12 therapy and who have stopped N 2 O; for such cases, imaging may not be necessary. We do not recommend routine brain MRI, unless suspecting an alternative disease process. Brain imaging in case series has either been universally normal, or it has shown T2/fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintense white matter lesions in the frontal, periventricular and centrum semiovale regions.

Further investigations

In general, patients with N 2 O-SACD do not need further investigation. In patients undergoing peripheral neurophysiology studies, the most common finding is a mixed axonal and demyelinating sensorimotor neuropathy, with the axonal component being more common than the demyelinating.

Patients who received the 48-hour regimen and who started treatment at 3 to 8 hours were more likely to improve 1 full neurologic grade at 6 months, to show more improvement in 6-month FIM, and to have more severe sepsis and severe pneumonia than patients in the 24-hour methylprednisolone group and the tirilazad group, but other complications and mortality were similar. Patients treated with tirilazad for 48 hours showed motor recovery rates equivalent to patients who received methylprednisolone for 24 hours. Conclusions. — Patients with acute spinal cord injury who receive methylprednisolone within 3 hours of injury should be maintained on the treatment regimen for 24 hours.

When methylprednisolone is initiated 3 to 8 hours after injury, patients should be maintained on steroid therapy for 48 hours. © 2025 JAMA+ AI Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### Expanding the MOG phenotype: brainstem encephalitis with punctate and curvilinear enhancement [^116TJd1C]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 17-year-old previously healthy boy developed headache and transient horizontal diplopia. Over the next 3 days, he developed paresthesias in his left hand, arm, and face. The symptoms rapidly progressed to include dysarthria, gait imbalance, and urinary retention. MRI of the brain demonstrated T2 prolongation in the pons with extension into the cerebral peduncles, with multiple areas of curvilinear and punctate contrast enhancement (figure). MRI of the spine revealed multifocal, patchy T2 signal abnormality throughout the thoracic cord and conus (figure). Although a diagnosis of diffuse midline glioma was initially considered, this was ultimately thought to be less likely due to the subacute onset of symptoms, the noted punctate and curvilinear enhancement, and the presence of spinal cold lesions. CSF analysis was notable for 64/µL white blood cells and a protein of 65 mg/dL. Flow cytometric analysis of the CSF showed that 58% of cells were mature lymphocytes. Of the lymphocytes, 90% were T-lymphocytes, with an elevated CD4:CD8 ratio of 8:1. Serum MOG-IgG1 testing, analyzed via a live cell–based flow cytometry assay at Mayo Clinic laboratories, was then sent, following a single dose of dexamethasone.

Because of clinical concern for CLIPPERS, IV methylprednisolone was started on hospital day 2. The patient's symptoms rapidly improved, and his neurologic examination at discharge was normal. Rituximab was started on hospital day 6 as a steroid-sparing agent, and a steroid taper was initiated. Following discharge, the MOG-IgG1 testing sent during admission returned positive with a titer of 1:1,000. A repeat brain and spine MRI performed 3 weeks later demonstrated near-complete resolution of previously seen abnormalities. Repeat MOG-IgG1 antibody testing sent 3 months after presentation remained positive, though with a decreased titer of 1:100. He remains symptom-free 6 months after presentation with no further lesion accrual.

### Subacute steroid-induced paraparesis: surgical treatment of a devastating "invisible" side effect [^115m4PEW]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To emphasize an underestimated side effect following long-term use of steroids.

Methods

We report on surgical treatment of two patients with serious neurologic deficits caused by epidural spinal lipoma following long-term intake of cortisone.

Results

Early decompression of the spinal cord by removal of epidural lipoma was the most effective treatment in these patients with progressive symptoms.

Conclusion

Diagnostic work-up of such patients should include early spinal MRI resulting in surgical intervention, if indicated. Decompression of the spinal cord eventually combined with fusion is necessary.

Spinal Cord MRI Lesion Evolution in Aquaporin 4–Immunoglobulin G–Positive Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (AQP4-IgG-NMOSD), Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein–Immunoglobulin G–Associated Disorder (MOGAD), and Multiple Sclerosis (MS)

Sagittal (A.a, B.a, C.a, D.a, E.a, F.a) and axial (A.b, B.b, C.b, D.b, E.b, F.b) thoracic spinal cord T2-weighted images are shown. In patients with myelitis, T2-hyperintense lesions associated with AQP4-IgG-NMOSD, longitudinally extensive lesions with swelling of the spinal cord (A.a) and holocord involvement acutely (A.b [T7 vertebral body level]), frequently show a dramatic reduction in size at follow-up MRI but remain detectable, often accompanied by focal lesional spinal cord atrophy (B.a, B.b [T7 vertebral body level]). In patients with MOGAD myelitis, the acute ventral-predominant long T2 lesion extending to the conus (C.a) is gray matter restricted axially (C.b [T3 vertebral body level]) and resolved completely at follow-up MRI (D.a, D.b [T3 vertebral body level]). In patients with MS, the typically short acute myelitis T2-hyperintense lesion (E.a, E.b [T6-T7 vertebral body level]) often only has modest reduction in size at follow-up MRI (F.a, F.b [T6-T7 vertebral body level]), at which time it can be better appreciated to involve the periphery (right lateral columns) of the spinal cord on axial images (F.b [T6-T7 vertebral body level]).

### Upper cervical epidural abscess resulting in respiratory compromise after lumbar steroid injection [^1157y2Bd]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Spinal epidural abscesses have a prevalence of 3 out of every 10,000 admissions. Abscesses above the level of C2, defined as upper cervical epidural abscesses, are even rarer still.

Case Report

We discuss a case in which a 45-year-old male patient developed an upper cervical epidural abscess 48 h after receiving a lumbar steroid injection. The patient presented with diminished strength in all four extremities and respiratory distress secondary to the space-occupying lesion near his spinal cord. His hospital course included surgical decompression and antibiotics. He was eventually discharged to rehabilitation, but never regained full strength in his arms or legs. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Patients who present with back or neck pain, fever, and neurologic deficits may have epidural abscess. In some patients, neurologic deficits may include respiratory distress if the upper cervical region is involved, and these patients have the possibility of airway decompensation. The diagnostic imaging modality of choice in patients with epidural abscess is MRI with gadolinium. Management involves supportive care, broad-spectrum antibiotics, which include coverage for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and early neurosurgical consultation.

### Inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy versus leptomeningeal disease following ipilimumab [^115GbjfJ]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with melanoma who develop neurologic complaints compatible with disease involving the spinal cord are most likely to have MRI of the spine as the first and frequently only diagnostic workup. Depending on the burden of metastatic disease, leptomeningeal carcinomatosis of the spine can have variable appearance. With mild disease, smooth, contiguous or noncontiguous fine coating of the cord surface and nerve roots, termed "sugar coating" or "zuckerguss" can be seen. Discrete nodules, large or small or even long segments of bulky mass-like disease can be seen in more severe disease. In either case, for the entity to cause diffuse, non-nodular involvement of cervical, thoracic and lumbar nerve roots, sparing the cord surface entirely, would be atypical for leptomeningeal carcinoma but very compatible with an inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. The finding of non-nodular involvement of nerve roots without involvement of the cord in a patient receiving Ipilimumab or other immunomodulatory agents should prompt further evaluation for an immune based mechanism, especially since steroids or other therapies may significantly alter the course. Standard CSF studies across these cases, apart from negative cytology, have variable appearance, from normal to albuminocytologic dissociation to pleocytosis. They are not likely to be diagnostic beyond helping to rule out leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. Autoimmune workup in our patient was negative. The most helpful studies were NCS, as is usually the case in cases of inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy not associated with malignancy. Based on these findings, we would recommend that patients with cancer who were treated with immunotherapy and presenting with sensory and motor weakness for whom there is suspicion on MRI of an inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, should undergo a thorough neurological evaluation which includes NCS, CSF studies, and consultation with a neurologist.

### Imaging approach to the cord T2 hyperintensity (myelopathy) [^111pUEXX]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

In clinically suspected cases of myelopathy, magnetic resonance imaging without and with gadolinium remains the modality of choice. The first and best imaging approach in the evaluation of myelopathy is to identify whether the cause of myelopathy is compressive or noncompressive. The commonest imaging finding in myelopathy is either focal or diffuse cord hyperintensity on the T2-weighted magnetic resonance images. Detailed clinical history, acuity of symptoms (acute vs insidious onset), distribution of the signal abnormalities, including length of cord involvement, specific tract involvement, and the region of the spinal cord that is affected, are very useful in making the diagnosis.

### Radiographic evolution of myelitis in a case of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) astrocytopathy [^117PMa4n]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Repeat imaging 11 days after initial imaging demonstrated longitudinally extensive, patchy T2 hyperintense signal throughout the central grey and lateral columns of the cervical and thoracic spine (figure 1). This correlated with our patient's clinical symptoms of upper and lower extremity weakness, numbness, paresthesias and bowel and bladder dysfunction. Longitudinally extensive myelitis is the most common pattern seen in GFAP astrocytopathy-associated myelitis. While there is variation in the literature, some studies report longitudinally extensive lesions in over 80% of cases of myelitis due to GFAP astrocytopathy. Other characteristic features include involvement of the central grey matter with subtle, poorly defined margins, which was also demonstrated in our case.

While GFAP astrocytopathy is generally considered to be steroid responsive, our patient developed radiographic myelitis while on high-dose steroids (dexamethasone 8 mg every 6 hours). There may have been some response to pulse dose steroids since disease progression plateaued after administration. However, it was not until our patient underwent plasmapheresis that he improved clinically and radiographically. Two weeks after the second MRI, there was near complete resolution of his imaging abnormalities (figure 1). This degree of radiographic resolution is similar to what is observed in MOGAD patients, where individuals can have complete resolution of imaging abnormalities. Other authors have also reported incomplete responses to steroids in GFAP astrocytopathy. Shan et al found a general trend towards worse outcomes in severe cases of GFAP astrocytopathy treated solely with steroids or intravenously Ig and favoured plasmapheresis or alternative immunosuppressants. Yang et al reported poor outcomes with severe disability and even death in a cohort of seven patients treated with steroids and intravenously Ig during their initial attack. Furthermore, Yang et al describes relapse in four of their seven patients which necessitated long-term steroid therapy and the initiation of a steroid sparing agent (azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil). Our findings support early implementation of alternative therapies such as plasmapheresis in severe cases of GFAP astrocytopathy.

Learning points

Glial fibrillar acidic protein (GFAP) astrocytopathy is a rare neuroinflammatory disorder that can present with meningoencephalomyelitis.
GFAP astrocytopathy can be mistaken for an infectious meningoencephalitis given the prominent constitutional and nonspecific symptoms that many patients present with.
MRI of the spine may be normal early on despite clinical evidence of spinal cord involvement.
Leptomeningeal enhancement surrounding the spinal cord may precede the radiographic appearance of myelitis.
While steroids are first line for GFAP astrocytopathy, not all patients respond and alternative treatments should not be delayed.

### Clinically isolated syndromes suggestive of multiple sclerosis, part 2: non-conventional MRI, recovery processes, and management [^111Gfh91]. The Lancet: Neurology (2005). Medium credibility.

The onset of multiple sclerosis (MS) in 85% of young adults is with a subacute clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) of the optic nerves, brainstem, or spinal cord. Whereas multifocal brain lesions are present on MRI in many patients with a CIS, some patients have additional abnormalities on quantitative MRI in otherwise normal-appearing white and grey matter that suggest an extensive pathological process. Functional outcome for patients with symptomatic CIS lesions is determined by the interplay of inflammation, demyelination, axonal damage, remyelination, and cortical adaptation. Recovery of function may be accelerated by high dose corticosteroids, and although interferon beta delays the development of a second relapse, its long-term effect is unknown. A better understanding of pathological and pathogenetic processes in patients with a CIS will facilitate the development of disease-modifying treatments for patients with MS before they become disabled. Continued clinical and laboratory investigation of patients with a CIS should be encouraged.

### A 28-year-old woman with left-sided weakness and atypical MRI lesions: from the national multiple sclerosis society case conference proceedings [^113YpK59]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Differential Diagnosis

Our patient presented with left-sided weakness and right-sided paresthesias that initially spontaneously resolved within 2 months and then recurred several months later and thereafter continued to gradually worsen. Her symptoms coincided with a preceding viral infection each time. Her MRI of the spine demonstrated an enhancing, expansile T2-hyperintense lesion from C3–6 and a nonenhancing lesion in the left aspect of the thoracic cord at T2-T4. The differential diagnosis for her clinical presentation was broad.

The initial etiology was considered to be inflammatory/autoimmune. The presence of 2 spinal cord lesions may suggest a relapsing inflammatory/autoimmune disease, especially when there were both enhancing and nonenhancing lesions present. Moreover, her partial response to several immunomodulatory therapies lent credence to a possible inflammatory/autoimmune cause. Her enhancing cervical cord lesion was left-sided and eccentric (causing a hemicord lesion) that led her to present with a Brown-Séquard syndrome, which could be seen in inflammatory/autoimmune conditions, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), although it should be noted that neoplastic lesions could also rarely cause a Brown-Séquard syndrome. The absence of brain lesions and the longitudinally extensive nature of her cervical cord lesion argued against MS, which tended to favor multiple discontinuous short-segment lesions in the spinal cord. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and MOG antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) could both cause longitudinally extensive myelopathies (≥ 3 vertebral segments). The enhancement pattern and expansile, edematous nature of the patient's cervical cord lesion could be seen in acute phases of NMOSD or MOGAD. However, the patient had negative serum AQP4 and MOG antibody testing on multiple cell-based assays. Although seronegative NMOSD could account for her presentation, she did not have any other core clinical characteristic of NMOSD that would fulfill the 2015 NMOSD diagnostic criteria. The criteria for diagnosing NMOSD without AQP4 antibodies required at least 2 core clinical characteristics (acute myelitis, optic neuritis, area postrema syndrome, acute brainstem syndrome, symptomatic narcolepsy or acute diencephalic clinical syndrome with NMOSD-typical diencephalic MRI lesions, or symptomatic cerebral syndrome with NMOSD-typical brain lesions) resulting from one or more clinical attacks. At least one of the core clinical characteristics must be optic neuritis, acute myelitis with longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, or area postrema syndrome. The patient only had acute myelitis with longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis and no other core clinical characteristic, so she did not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for seronegative NMOSD. Finally, hypointense lesions on T1-weighted sequences ("T1 dark spots") could be found in inflammatory/autoimmune conditions, including NMOSD and MS, although our patient's cervical cord lesion was isointense on T1-weighted sequence (Figure 2).

### Cord compression due to extramedullary hematopoiesis in an adolescent with known beta thalassemia major [^116H5xPm]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

We describe a 16 year-old male with β thalassemia major and gait disturbances that had not been given blood transfusions due to a severe childhood transfusion reaction. Thoracic spine MRI demonstrated hematopoietic marrow throughout the spine and epidural masses causing cord compression consistent with extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH). After treatment with steroids, radiotherapy and monitored blood transfusions, the patient demonstrated significant improvement of his paraspinal lesions and near complete resolution of his neurological symptoms. While EMH causing cord compression in adolescents is rare in the current era of bone marrow transplantation or chronic transfusions, it should be considered when thalassemia major patients present with neurological deficits. The well defined imaging features of EMH can play a central role in its diagnosis and management, especially because surgical and / or radiotherapeutic intervention are often considered in cases of failed medical treatment.

### MRI criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: MAGNIMS consensus guidelines [^116Jqt5P]. The Lancet: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Spinal cord imaging

Based on the 2010 McDonald criteria, clinically silent spinal cord lesions can contribute to both DIS and DIT. At symptom onset, spinal cord imaging is recommended in patients with clinical features localized to the spinal cord to rule out alternative cord pathology (e.g. compression, spinal cord tumor, NMO, vasculitides) and in those with non-spinal CIS not fulfilling brain MRI for DIS. In this second group, whole cord imaging showed that the presence of one spinal cord lesion identifies patients at higher risk of MS confirmation. Imaging of the entire cord, using at least two MR sequences (e.g. T2 and STIR, T2 and DIR, T2 and post-contrast T1) is preferable to increase confidence in lesion identification, in part because approximately 40% of spinal cord lesions are found in the thoracolumbar region (Figure 2). – The value of spinal cord imaging for DIT in patients without accrual of deficits referable to the spine is limited, since new clinically silent cord lesions are not frequent.

In summary, whole spinal cord MRI is recommended to meet DIS criteria, whereas it has a limited role for DIT.

### Multiple sclerosis followed by neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder: from the national multiple sclerosis society case conference proceedings [^114YqimP]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Given the severity of deterioration, the patient was treated with IV methylprednisolone and a course of plasma exchange. Repeat imaging of the spinal cord now demonstrated a longitudinally extensive pattern of confluent hyperintensity with peripheral enhancement and marked edema that spanned from the cervicomedullary junction to the upper thoracic spinal cord (Figure 4). Serum testing by cell-based assay yielded a positive AQP4 IgG at a titer of 1:2,560, and a diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) was confirmed. Siponimod was discontinued while ocrelizumab, a CD20 monoclonal antibody, was initiated.

### A 28-year-old woman with left-sided weakness and atypical MRI lesions: from the national multiple sclerosis society case conference proceedings [^115BbutQ]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Another feature of this patient case was that there was initial improvement and response to anti-inflammatory/immunomodulating treatments, including IVIG and high-dose steroids, which led us to consider the possibility of an inflammatory/autoimmune process. However, response to anti-inflammatory treatments may be due to a reduction of CNS infiltrating immune cells after breakdown of the blood-brain barrier from the glioma, which could lead to symptomatic improvement when cord edema is reduced. Spinal cord lymphoma is a different tumor type that is particularly responsive to steroids, resulting in initial, transient improvement of both clinical symptoms and MRI findings. Therefore, a response to steroids did not necessarily support an inflammatory/autoimmune cause. A staccato temporal course and response to steroids could be seen in spinal cord neoplasms.

Ultimately, there were several red flags about the patient's presentation that suggested a malignancy over an inflammatory/autoimmune myelopathy. Her onset of symptoms was insidious and slowly progressive over the span of 7–8 months, which was concerning for a neoplasm. The time course from symptom onset to maximal severity is generally shorter and more subacute in inflammatory/autoimmune myelopathies. Some infectious myelopathies, such as tuberculous or syphilitic infections, could also present insidiously and should be ruled out, especially if there were any coinciding infectious symptoms. The dissociation between the patient's initial mild manifestation of her clinical symptoms and the extensive spinal cord lesion observed on MRI could be further suggestive of a slow neoplastic growth over an inflammatory/autoimmune etiology. In addition to a prolonged time course, the patient had an expansile, enhancing spinal cord lesion warranting a high degree of suspicion for tumor. Although an expansile cord lesion could be seen in acute phases of inflammatory/autoimmune conditions, such as NMOSD or MOGAD, it was a red flag when the lesion persistently enhanced after 3 months of onset or when symptoms continued to progress despite anti-inflammatory treatment.

### Limited added value of systematic spinal cord MRI vs brain MRI alone to classify patients with MS as active or inactive during follow-up [^115HKUXE]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

New brain and spinal cord lesions during follow-up

Overall, when both symptomatic and asymptomatic intervals were considered, 97 out of 221 intervals (44%) had no new brain or SC lesion, 82 (37%) had only new brain lesion, 8 (4%) had only new SC lesion and 34 (15%) had both new brain and SC lesion. Amongst the 34 intervals with both new brain and SC lesions, the majority (25 out of 34) involved at least three new brain lesions.

When only asymptomatic intervals were considered (n = 179), 4 intervals (2%) had isolated new SC lesions and 15 (8%) had both new brain and SC lesions. Of the 15 intervals with both new brain and SC lesions, the majority had at least three new brain lesions (10 out of 15). The results were very different when only symptomatic intervals were considered (n = 42), with 4 intervals (10%) with isolated new spinal cord lesions and 19 (45%) with both new brain and spinal cord lesions. These results are summarised in Fig. 2.

New cervical vs. thoracic spinal cord lesions during follow-up

The occurrence of new cervical cord lesions was higher than thoracic lesions during follow-up. Of the 42 intervals with SC MRI activity (out of 221), 28 had one or more new cervical spinal cord lesions with no thoracic lesions (67%), six had both new cervical and thoracic lesions (14%), and only eight had one or more new thoracic lesions without new cervical lesions (19%).

### Concurrent transverse myelitis and acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy [^116tsBLA]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

A woman in her 40s presented with thoracic banding dysaesthesia and lower motor neuron weakness. Spinal imaging revealed a short segment of transverse myelitis and neurophysiology was suggestive of concurrent acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. The patient improved with consecutive intravenous immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone treatment. Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy is a progressive immune-mediated peripheral neuropathy which responds to intravenous immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis, whereas transverse myelitis is a central inflammatory syndrome usually treated with corticosteroid. We highlight differentiating features of the clinical presentation and the utility of investigations such as neurophysiology and MRI along with a review of treatment and the role for corticosteroid therapy.

### Comparison of spinal cord MRI features among children with acquired demyelinating syndromes… [^114vGJ7o]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

A, Sagittal and axial T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the spine shows a spinal cord lesion spanning over more than 10 vertebral segments, with H-sign appearance most evident in the cranial and caudal extremities of the lesion and hazy involvement of most of the cross-sectional spinal cord area in the central portion of the lesion. B, Sagittal and axial T2-weighted MRI of the spine shows a longitudinally extensive lesion with pencil-sign appearance on sagittal view and corresponding anterior-horns hyperintensity on axial image. C, Sagittal and axial gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted MRI of the spine shows leptomeningeal and diffuse roots enhancement. Marked T2-hyperintensity of the gray matter on axial views was observed in 22 of 35 lesions in participants with MOGAD.

In fewer cases, the hyperintensity was restricted to the anterior horns. The T2-hyperintensity of the spine gray matter was often accompanied by fainter hyperintensity in the surrounding white matter, characteristically observed in the central portion of the lesion, whereas gray matter T2-hyperintensity was prominent at the upper and lower extremes. Although the H-sign was never observed among participants with MS, it was found in 14 of 42 participants with seronegative myelitis. In this latter group, an additional 21% of participants showed the snake-eyes sign. Notably, no bright spotty lesions were detected among children with MOGAD or MS. In this case, the LETM was characterized by a short core of T2-hyperintensity, with associated nodular enhancement and a larger portion of fainter hyperintensity extending over 3 cervical vertebrae.

Of note, in 2 participants with MOGAD, 1 with MS, and 7 with seronegative myelitis, lesions that appeared longitudinally extensive on sagittal views were more accurately considered contiguous independent short lesions identifiable on axial planes. This contrasted with persistence of spinal cord abnormalities in all participants with MS and in 17 of 29 participants with seronegative myelitis.

### Idiopathic transverse myelitis presenting as the Brown-Sequard syndrome [^1156J7y1]. Spinal Cord (2009). Low credibility.

Study Design

Case report.

Objectives

To report an unusual case of Brown-Sequard syndrome (BSS) associated with idiopathic transverse myelitis (TM).

Setting

Department of Neurosurgery, Chonnam National University Hospital, Gwangju, South Korea.

Methods

A 38-year-old man presented with left leg weakness and right-sided decrease in sensation at the T11 level below. Magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the thoracic spine showed diffuse swelling of the spinal cord spanning the fifth to the eighth thoracic vertebra. The lesion had high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Eccentric nodular enhancement within the left anterolateral aspect of the spinal cord was appreciated with gadolinium administration.

Results

The patient was treated with pulsed methylprednisone and showed marked improvement in neurological function within 3 days. An MRI at 5-month follow-up demonstrated complete resolution of the abnormalities.

Conclusion

This case illustrates a rare case of BSS caused by idiopathic TM of the thoracic spinal cord. TM should be considered in the differential diagnosis of BSS.

### Low back pain [^112LAe3S]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2012). Medium credibility.

Low back pain with radiating pain — imaging recommendations specify targeted use: In patients with severe or progressive neurologic deficits, prompt workup with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) is recommended. If patients are potential candidates for surgery or epidural steroid injections, MRI (or CT if unable to undergo MRI) is recommended. In the absence of these findings, there is no evidence that routine imaging affects treatment decisions or outcomes in these patients.

### Corticosteroid-induced paraplegia… [^114aqmYa]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

He was treated with intravenous methylprednisone for presumed transverse myelitis. However, approximately 1. 5 hours after administration, he experienced acute paraplegia. A repeated cervical and thoracic MRI showed no changes. Seventy-two hours later, paraplegia resolved. A month later, his gait deteriorated further and he underwent a T10-T11 laminectomy. An intraoperative fluorescein angiogram revealed normal findings. The spinal cord appeared normal; spinal cord biopsies were nondiagnostic. One month later, he was treated again with methylprednisone. As before, approximately 1. 5 hours after the infusion, he experienced acute paraplegia, which resolved after 48 hours. After this episode, his bladder function worsened and he required self-catheterization. His gait further deteriorated such that he required a wheelchair. A positron emission tomographic scan to detect systemic sarcoidosis or other inflammation yielded negative results.

Considering the worsening of myelopathic symptoms after walking and improvement at rest and worsening following intravenous corticosteroid, the working diagnosis was spinal dural arterial venous fistula despite the previous negative angiogram result. A magnetic resonance angiogram spine showed dilatation of posterior pial venous plexus associated with cord expansion and intramedullary edema, strongly suggesting the presence of venous hypertension. A, Sagittal T2-weighted image of the thoracic spine demonstrates mild cord expansion associated with intramedullary hyperintensity extending into the conus. B, Angiogram demonstrating L2 spinal dural arterial venous fistula.

Discussion The diagnosis of SDAVF is difficult because its presenting features are similar to those seen with other neurological disorders and its radiological identification is challenging. Therefore, there is often a delay to diagnosis of SDAVF; however, disability is highly preventable when recognized and treated early.
1. The proposed mechanism of corticosteroid-induced exacerbation of weakness is transient fluid retention, further exacerbated when administered with a saline infusion, leading to venous engorgement and further impairment of venous egress from the dural shunt. This exacerbates spinal cord edema, resulting in neurological worsening, which may resolve as the corticosteroid-induced hypervolemia wanes.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of acute intramedullary myelopathy: radiological differential diagnosis for the on-call radiologist [^115mRaQR]. Clinical Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Spinal cord disease is often viewed as having a poor outcome. Although in certain conditions this is true, non-traumatic myelopathy encompasses a vast array of diseases some of which are exquisitely responsive to treatment. Accurate diagnosis becomes important as damage is often progressive and long-term disability and morbidity is related to the degree of neurological impairment when the diagnosis is reached. Out-of-hours magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is generally requested and performed to ascertain whether there is spinal cord compression; however, there are other causes of a cord syndrome, which are more subtle. This review aims to provide a summary of the imaging features of non-traumatic intramedullary spinal cord emergencies, many of which may appear radiologically similar.

### A possible Guillain-Barrésyndrome / transverse myelitis overlap syndrome after recent COVID-19 [^113cReg2]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

The concurrency of GBS and TM (ie, GBS/TM overlap syndrome) represents a rare paradox that typically affects children and young adults more frequently than elderly patients. The clinical features of GBS/TM overlap syndrome can include GBS elements such as acute flaccid paralysis with hyporeflexia and TM elements such as pyramidal signs, sphincter dysfunction and sensory level. It is critical to note that the presence of both sensory level and sphincter dysfunction suggests the concurrency of TM in the overlap syndrome. Albumin-cytological dissociation (elevated CSF protein and normal cell count) with an increased IgG index is a non-specific CSF finding. However, two practical measures are useful to evaluate the concurrency of GBS and TM: abnormal electrophysiological findings and the presence of a central T2-hyperintense thoracic spinal cord signal in MRI.

Based on a review of the literature, the majority of reported cases of GBS/TM overlap syndrome have been attributed to infections such as acute viral illness, influenza, Mycoplasma, Legionella, Bartonella and Zika virus. Two previous cases of overlap syndrome after SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported: one was a paediatric caseand the other was in a 40-year-old man. In the latter case, the patient presented with upper respiratory symptoms followed by lower limbs weakness, with mild COVID-19 findings determined by high-resolution computed chest tomography despite a negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. The initial diagnosis was TM based on cervical spine MRI findings; however, lack of improvement on steroid therapy necessitated CSF analysis, which showed albuminocytological dissociation, and nerve conduction analysis, which showed acute sensory and motor axonal neuropathy, a variant form of GBS that eventually improved with plasmapheresis. Sporadic cases of vaccine-induced GBS/TM overlap syndrome have also been reported. Finally, immunotherapy-related neurological disorders account for 1%–5% of all immune medication side effects. Both TM and GBS have been separately reported in some case reports after administration of nivolumab or pembrolizumab but their concurrency has not been reported in association with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

### Noncompressive myelopathy in acute community-acquired bacterial meningitis: report of seven cases and review of literature [^115mrPVE]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Spinal MRI revealed T2‐weighted abnormalities in six of seven patients (Figure 1). Abnormalities were seen in the thoracic spinal cord in four of six patients and in the cervical spinal cord in three of six patients. Longitudinally extensive T2 lesions, defined as lesions extending across three or more vertebral segments, were reported in three patients. Gadolinium was administered in three patients and showed spinal cord enhancement in one. One patient had multiple epidural abscesses on spinal MRI, which did not cause compression (Figure 1d). These abscesses were, therefore, not considered to be the cause of the myelopathy. Lumbar puncture was repeated in three of seven patients, revealing improvement of CSF abnormalities and negative cultures in all patients. No patients were tested for myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)–IgG or aquaporin‐4 (AQP4)–IgG. Two patients were diagnosed with postinflammatory myelitis and were subsequently treated with high‐dose corticosteroids (Figure 1a, b). One patient was diagnosed with infectious myelitis and treated with penicillin for 6 weeks (Figure 1c, d). Two patients were diagnosed with spinal infarction, and in the other two patients no specific diagnosis was made; these four patients were not treated with immunosuppressive treatment.

This patient was diagnosed with postinflammatory myelitis. (b) T2‐weighted sagittal spinal MRI shows a longitudinal hyperintense lesion in a large part of the thoracic spinal cord. This patient was also diagnosed with postinflammatory myelitis. (c, d) T2‐weighted sagittal spinal MRI shows a longitudinal hyperintense lesion in the lower cervical spinal cord (c) and an epidural abscess at C1–C2 (d) on T1‐weighted images. This patient was diagnosed with infectious myelitis.

Improvement of spinal cord function was noted in four of seven patients. All patients had an AIS grade C or higher at discharge, but only two patients attained an AIS grade D at discharge and regained functional motor ability. Bladder and bowel dysfunction persisted in all five patients. Outcome was considered unfavorable in all seven patients, because all patients were not able to live independently and were discharged to a rehabilitation center.

### Primary angiitis of the central nervous system: serial MRI of brain and spinal cord [^115UrYfj]. Neuroradiology (2001). Low credibility.

MRI findings in primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) are highly variable, ranging from normal to diffusely abnormal. We describe brain and spinal cord abnormalities in patients with PACNS and changes over time, to provide criteria which could be useful for differential diagnosis. We reviewed six patients, with a final diagnosis of PACNS, who underwent serial contrast-enhanced brain and spinal MRI. Follow-up ranged from 12 to 60 months. Brain MRI showed multiple small abnormalities in all patients, giving high signal on T2-weighted images, focal or diffuse, mainly in deep and subcortical white matter; four patients had both supra- and infratentorial lesions. On the initial MRI, in five patients, almost 90% of the abnormal foci showed contrast enhancement. Virchow-Robin perivascular spaces were enlarged and simultaneously enhancing in four patients. Three patients also had spinal cord abnormalities, in the cervical and thoracic segments in two, and exclusively cervical segment in one. Two patients had brain biopsy-proven PACNS; in the remainder, the diagnosis of PACNS was presumptive, considering similarities in clinical and MRI features and MRI follow-up. On MRI, after steroid and immunosuppressive therapy, a significant decrease in the number and size of the abnormalities, enhancing and nonenhancing and of enhancing perivascular spaces was observed. Simultaneous enhancement of brain and spinal cord lesions and of perivascular spaces, at the onset of the disease, which resolves during follow-up, can therefore suggest PACNS.

Palliation of spinal cord compression in lung cancer includes imaging and acute management: In patients with lung cancer that have new onset of back pain, sagittal T1-weighted MRI of the entire spine is recommended (Grade 1C). In patients with lung cancer and epidural spinal cord metastases, who are not symptomatic, prompt treatment with high-dose dexamethasone and radiotherapy is recommended (Grade 1B). In lung cancer patients with symptomatic, radiographically confirmed epidural spinal cord compression and good performance status, it is recommended that neurosurgical consultation be sought and, if appropriate, surgery should be performed immediately and followed by radiation therapy (Grade 1B).

### Pre-contrast T1-weighted imaging of the spinal cord may be unnecessary in patients with multiple sclerosis [^112uxhT5]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Final diagnoses for the 265 patients established by the treating neurologists included suspected or definite MS (n = 203), clinically isolated syndrome (CIS; n = 41), radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS; n = 3), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD; n = 8), psychosomatic disorders (n = 5), or remained unclear (n = 5). MRI of the patients was performed for routine follow-up (n = 71), because of new symptoms (n = 94), or for the initial diagnosis of MS (n = 100).

Overall, 183/265 (69%) patients showed 745 T2-hyperintense lesions in the spinal cord (Table 2), with 395/745 (53%) lesions being located in the cervical and 350/745 (47%) lesions being located in the thoracic spinal cord. 255/745 (34%) lesions were predominantly located centrally in the gray matter and 490/745 (66%) lesions were predominantly located peripherally in the white matter. 696/745 (93%) lesions had a circumscribed appearance and 49/745 (7%) showed a longitudinally extensive configuration of at least two vertebral heights. None of the patients with psychosomatic disorders or unclear diagnoses (n = 10) showed a pathological hyperintense signal in the spinal cord on T2-w images.

Table 2
Number of patients and lesions listed separately per diagnosis

In consensus reading, 31 black holes (Fig. 1) were found in 25 patients (reader 1: 21 lesions in 17 patients; reader 2: 28 lesions in 24 patients). Diagnostic confidence was rated as high by both readers (reader 1: 4.04 ± 0.81; reader 2: 3.80 ± 0.92). Inter-rater concordance was substantial (κ = 0.700). A typical hypointense artifact on T1-w imaging was found by both readers in the cervical spinal cord at level C5/C6, most probably caused by swallowing, without a corresponding hyperintense signal on T2-w images. Only two lesions in the cervical spinal cord appeared hyperintense on pre-contrast T1-w images, together with strong CE on respective post-contrast T1-w images (Fig. 2).

### Treatment of myelitis in Behçet's disease with rituximab [^116S6kGJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Behçet's disease (BD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder that involves the parenchymal central nervous system (neuro-BD, NBD) approximately in 5–49% of patients, causing lesions rarely located in the spinal cord (SC). We report the first case of NBD-myelitis treated with intravenous rituximab. A 41-year-old man affected by BD presented with mild paraparesis with a miliary involvement and a 'net-like' gadolinium enhancement (Gde) of the SC. After a therapeutic attempt with pulsed cyclophosphamide and intravenous methylprednisolone, the clinical and neuroradiological course worsened. A progressive improvement was observed after rituximab administration associated with low doses of oral prednisone. No disease activity was detected and the patient reported no adverse event. After six rituximab cycles, cervical MRI was normal while thoracic MRI showed a slight T2-weighted hyperintensity of D4-D10 spinal tract without Gde. A combined use of rituximab and oral steroids resulted in a long-term suppression of NBD activity without any safety concern.

Three weeks later, while on oral dexamethasone, she presented to our institution with worsening symptoms and inability to ambulate. Examination demonstrated 1/5 hip flexion/extension, 2/5 knee flexion/extension, and 5/5 distally on the MRC strength grading scale on the left and 4/5 hip flexion on the right; hyperreflexic patellar reflexes with crossed adduction; bilateral Babinski signs; and a T10 sensory level to pinprick. The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score was 8.0 at admission. Repeat MRI showed interval evolution of the spinal cord hyperintense lesions with decreasing size and resolution of enhancement but addition of new foci of T2 hyperintensity and enhancement throughout the cervical and thoracic cord (Figure 2). Normal/negative bloodwork included complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, HIV serology, varicella zoster IgG, vitamin B12, and folate. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was negative for metastases or hilar lymphadenopathy. Breast ultrasound showed resolution of breast mass. CSF demonstrated 14 nucleated cells/µL (normal 0–5; 95% lymphocytes), glucose of 98 mg/dL (normal 40–70; corresponding blood glucose 226 mg/dL; CSF/blood glucose ratio of 0.43), elevated protein of 85 mg/dL (normal 15–45), elevated IgG index of 0.71 (normal 0.00–0.61), absent oligoclonal bands, negative cytology, negative CSF bacterial and fungal cultures, negative cryptococcus antigen, and negative herpes simplex virus PCR.

### The impact of methylprednisolone on lesion severity following spinal cord injury [^113jP8ju]. Spine (2007). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective study comparing spinal cord injury (SCI) lesion characteristics in methylprednisolone (MPS) treated versus untreated patients as demonstrated by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.

Objective

Determine if the administration of MPS immediately following SCI affects lesion severity.

Summary Of Background Data

The administration of MPS in the setting of acute SCI has become controversial. Since magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is sensitive for the detection of spinal cord edema and hemorrhage, changes in lesion characteristics would support a biologic effect due to MPS.

Methods

Patients with cervical spinal injury treated with the recommended dose of methylprednisolone (bolus 30 mg/kg + 5.4 mg/kg per hour over 24 hours) initiated within 8 hours of injury were compared to historical controls that did not receive steroids. All patients (n = 82) sustained clinically complete SCI (ASIA Grade A) and underwent MRI on the same 1.5 Tesla unit. The length of spinal cord edema, presence/absence of intramedullary hemorrhage, and length of intramedullary hemorrhage were measured on T2-weighted and gradient echo MR images. Comparisons of lesion severity were then made between untreated and treated subjects.

Results

Forty-eight of 82 patients with complete injuries received MPS therapy. After accounting for differences in the mean age of the treatment and control groups, multiple regression analysis demonstrated a persistent reduction in the mean length of intramedullary hemorrhage, 2.6 U in the treatment group versus 4.4 U in the control group (P = 0.04). Although there was a reduction in the number of patients exhibiting spinal cord hemorrhage in the treated group compared with the untreated group (65% vs. 91%), this result was not statistically significant (P = 0.16). There was no statistically significant effect of MPS treatment on the mean length of the spinal cord edema between treated versus untreated subjects (10.3 vs. 12.0, respectively, P = 0.85).

Conclusions

MRI suggests MPS therapy in the acute phase of spinal cord injury may decrease the extent of intramedullary spinal cord hemorrhage.

Lesion dynamics in a 4-year-old male with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD). a, b Sagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance images obtained from a spinal scan during attack (a) and at 1-month follow-up (b) show typical MOGAD interval complete resolution of the abnormal T2-hyperintensity along the cervical and upper thoracic cord

Timing and predictors of T2-lesion resolution were assessed in a total of 583 brain and spinal cord lesions (55 pediatric and adult patients). The median time to resolution of a T2-lesion was 3 months (IQR 1.4–7.0), and most lesions resolved within the first 12 months. Nearly 60% of T2-lesions resolved in the absence of treatment. However, acute T1-hypointensity associated with T2-lesions decreased the likelihood of resolution (odds ratio [95%]). Persistent T2-lesions might represent a higher degree of parenchymal destruction and axonal loss, beyond repair and remyelination capacity (Figs. 1, 5, and 19). In a retrospective multicenter UK study, the proportion of normal brain MRI scans was reduced after each clinical relapse, with a marked reduction of the ability of brain repair after the third clinical attack. Early treatment with steroids and/or plasma exchange improves T2-lesion resolution.

Scale bars in A and B are 20 μm.

The patient received IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) at 2 g/kg over 5 days with improved clumsiness in her left hand and improved numbness in her right foot. Two weeks after discharge (mid-June 2022), she reported recurrent symptoms with increased difficulty lifting her left hand which prompted readmission. During this admission, she received another course of IVIG along with IV methylprednisolone 1,000 mg daily for 5 days. Again, her symptoms significantly improved. A few weeks later (mid-July 2022), she was seen in our neuroimmunology clinic where she reported return of left arm/hand weakness. Her neurologic examination showed 3/5 strength throughout her left upper extremity. She was given an additional course of high-dose steroids for 5 days (oral prednisone rounded to 1,000 mg daily). After initial improvement with this additional course of steroids, she was readmitted to the hospital in August 2022 secondary to return of left arm/hand weakness. Follow-up MRI revealed persistent enhancement of the cervical cord lesion. She received 2 courses of plasma exchange (5 rounds per course) with partial improvement in strength, although she still had significant weakness in her left arm and hand. Her treatment course is shown in Figure 1B.

### Extensive longitudinal acute transverse myelitis complicated by pulseless ventricular tachycardia and recent shingles vaccination [^115Vfa27]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

This case describes a 50-year-old male with a history of psoriatic arthritis who presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of ascending bilateral lower extremity paresthesia one week following a shingles vaccine. MRI of the patient's spine was significant for longitudinally extensive T2 hyperintensity involving the lower cervical spine with extension into the upper thoracic spine suggestive of acute transverse myelitis (ATM). The patient's hospital course was complicated by a self-limiting episode of pulseless ventricular tachycardia accompanied by a brief loss of consciousness. Initial treatment included IV solumedrol, however due to lack of clinical improvement after a 5-day steroid treatment, plasmapheresis was initiated. The patient's condition improved with plasmapheresis and he was subsequently discharged to a rehab facility with a diagnosis of ATM of unclear etiology. Extensive serology, cardiac and CSF studies failed to determine the cause of this patient's myelitis or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. The following case report explores the potential factors that may have contributed to this patient's symptoms.

Metastatic spinal tumors — epidemiology, presentation, and emergency signs are summarized: "Extradural lesions account for about 95% of spinal tumors, mostly in the thoracic region". Spinal cord compression "affects 5% to 10% of all patients with cancer, with more than 20,000 cases diagnosed each year in the United States", and "The majority of patients initially complain of progressive radicular pain". If untreated, "neurologic deficits rapidly progress to paralysis". A study of "319 patients" found delays of "(3 months)" to report initial pain and "(2 months)" to diagnosis, supporting the directive that clinicians establish "prompt diagnosis by spine MRI". Once diagnosed, "spinal cord compression is considered a medical emergency; intervention should be implemented immediately to prevent further neurologic decline".

### Location, length, and enhancement: systematic approach to differentiating intramedullary spinal cord lesions [^1122xk3A]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disease (NMOSD)

NMOSD (also known as Devic's disease) is a relapsing disease with the typical triad of optic neuritis, myelitis, and positive NMO-IgG, an autoantibody to the protein channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4), which is expressed on foot processes of astrocytes (Fig. 6). The underlying pathophysiology is of autoimmune astrocytopathy, distinguishing this condition from MS and other demyelinating processes. The condition is much more common in females (5:1), and brain lesions are shown to occur much more frequently than previously thought. Among other diagnostic criteria, presence of longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions (LESCL), which are characterised by T2 hyperintense signal of the cord traversing at least three vertebral body levels, is key to its diagnosis.

A 20-year-old female presents with lower back pain and difficulty walking. a Sagittal T2 fat-saturated image demonstrates multiple areas of long-segment hyperintensity (arrows). b Axial T1 post-contrast image of the orbits reveals subtle right optic nerve enhancement (arrow). c Axial T2 image shows central cord involvement (arrow). d Axial T1 post-contrast image demonstrates corresponding enhancement (arrow)

Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis

ADEM is an acute, often monophasic post-infectious or inflammatory condition that most commonly occurs in children (Fig. 7). ADEM can involve both white and grey matter, and although it can demonstrate periventricular brain lesions similar to MS, it is more likely to have ill-defined, larger, and more rounded lesions, with a predilection for deep grey matter and the brainstem. Involvement of the brainstem and spinal cord occurs in approximately one-third of patients with ADEM and its spinal characteristics are helpful in differentiating this condition from MS.

### Is extensive cervical laminoplasty an effective treatment for spinal cord sarcoidosis combined with cervical spondylosis? [^112jHq4r]. European Spine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Patients with neurosarcoidosis are usually initially treated with steroid administration even when they have concomitant cord compression on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Operative intervention may be indicated in patients with spinal cord sarcoidosis requiring either tissue biopsy for diagnosis or associated with progressive neurologic symptoms. However, there have been no previous reports describing clinical outcomes of laminoplasty for spinal cord sarcoidosis. The objectives of this study are to investigate whether extensive cervical laminoplasty is an effective treatment for spinal cord sarcoidosis combined with spondylotic changes and/or cervical spinal canal stenosis. Open-door laminoplasty was performed in three patients with spinal cord sarcoidosis. All patients received intensive corticosteroid therapy after the operation MRI imaging was performed in all patients before and after the operation. Operative outcomes were not satisfactory and the clinical courses of the patients fluctuated after corticosteroid therapy. Daily life activities were not significantly improved after treatments in any of the three patients, and in the long-term follow-up period the clinical course of one patient was one of inexorable deterioration to a state of quadriplegia. The possibility of spinal cord sarcoidosis should be included in the differential diagnosis, when a distinct high signal intensity area is observed within the spinal cord on T2-weighted MR images in patients with spondylotic changes. Laminoplasty is not an effective intervention for the treatment of spinal cord sarcoidosis even when patients have spondylotic changes and/or a constitutionally narrowing cervical spinal canal. Patients with neurosarcoidosis should be treated first with steroid administration even when they have concomitant cord compression on MRI.

### MR imaging in intramedullary cysticercosis [^114RSPAA]. Neuroradiology (2001). Low credibility.

Although intramedullary spinal cord cysticercosis (IMC) is uncommon, its presence is being increasingly recognised by magnetic resonance imaging. We studied six patients from an endemic region and present the MRI features and clinical correlation of IMC. Six patients who presented with para- or quadriplegia were studied by contrast enhanced spinal MRI. Prompted by the spinal lesions, all patients underwent brain MRI. Clinical data and laboratory studies were reviewed in all patients. Definite diagnosis was established in the form of response to drug therapy (n = 4) and histopathology (n = 2). Follow-up MRI studies of spine and brain were obtained in four patients 2 months after they started medical treatment, regardless of surgery. Five patients showed fusiform and focal enlargement of the spinal cord (cervical 2, thoracic 3). Well-defined cysts with a slightly hyperintense mural nodule were identified in five patients in Ti-weighted images (T1WI). All cysts were hyperintense on T2WI and merged with the surrounding oedema. Oedema extended one to three vertebral levels above or below the cyst. Post-contrast T1WI showed well-defined, ring enhancing lesions with smooth walls in all patients. Symptoms in all patients correlated with the level of the lesions. Brain studies demonstrated lesions in just two patients. Histopathological confirmation was obtained in two patients. Follow-up spinal MRI was normal in two patients, following 2 months of treatment while residual and smaller lesions were seen in two patients. Two patients were asymptomatic and denied follow-up MRI. MRI of spinal cysticercosis were typical of and similar to those seen in cerebral lesions in our patients and corresponded to the level of symptoms. All cysts were surrounded by oedema. Two of four patients showed residual lesions after 2 months of therapy and 33% of patients showed concomitant intracranial lesions.
