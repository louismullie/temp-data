## Question

drig of choice for thrombo embolism prophylaxis - is it enaxoparin? how much dose? whats the course?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether enoxaparin is the drug of choice for thromboembolism prophylaxis, what the correct dose is, and how long it should be given across common clinical scenarios. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical context because prophylaxis differs by setting (medical inpatient, surgical, orthopedic, cancer, trauma, COVID-19). Then, I should verify whether enoxaparin is indeed preferred or merely acceptable in each context. Next, I will check standard dosing by scenario and note exceptions like obesity or renal impairment. After that, I need to confirm duration recommendations and whether extended prophylaxis is indicated. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, scenario-based answer and highlight alternatives where appropriate.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate treatment with prophylaxis; the question is about primary thromboprophylaxis to prevent VTE, not treatment of established DVT/PE, and the agent in question is enoxaparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin given subcutaneously, which is widely used for inpatient prophylaxis across multiple settings.

> Now, for acutely ill medical inpatients, I should verify whether enoxaparin is preferred and at what dose; guidelines endorse pharmacologic prophylaxis with LMWH or UFH for at-risk medical patients, and enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously once daily is a standard regimen, with rivaroxaban 10 mg daily as an alternative in heart failure cohorts when renal function allows, so enoxaparin is appropriate and commonly used here [^112His2h].

> Wait, let me verify the extended-duration question in medical patients; I initially thought extended prophylaxis might be broadly beneficial, but hold on, I should double-check the balance of VTE reduction versus bleeding; high-certainty evidence shows extended-duration anticoagulation reduces symptomatic VTE but increases major bleeding, so routine extended prophylaxis after hospitalization is not favored outside selected high-risk, low-bleeding-risk cases, and decisions should be individualized [^1148Jfis].

> For surgical patients, I need to check whether enoxaparin remains a reasonable choice; yes, LMWH is an accepted option for general surgery prophylaxis, with enoxaparin 40 mg once daily commonly used, and extended prophylaxis is particularly emphasized after major abdominal/pelvic cancer surgery, where 28 days of LMWH reduces VTE without excessive bleeding in appropriately selected patients [^1117NJHA] [^111MpLru].

> Next, I should review orthopedic surgery, where practice has evolved; historically, LMWH was standard, but wait, I should confirm current options; guidelines and regulatory approvals now include rivaroxaban or apixaban as alternatives, with apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily for 35 days after hip replacement and 12 days after knee replacement, so enoxaparin remains acceptable but is no longer uniquely preferred in this space [^11239tzh] [^114kr3Ug] [^115qWoSj].

> For patients with cancer, let me consider both surgical and medical oncology; LMWH is preferred for initial VTE treatment and for inpatient prophylaxis, and extended postoperative LMWH for about 4 weeks after major cancer surgery is recommended, while in ambulatory cancer patients at high thrombotic risk (e.g. Khorana ≥ 2), prophylaxis with apixaban, rivaroxaban, or LMWH can be considered if bleeding risk is low, so enoxaparin remains a key option but shares the stage with DOACs in selected outpatients [^113RgQnF] [^1117NJHA].

> In trauma and critical illness, I should confirm whether standard enoxaparin dosing suffices; evidence suggests standard 30–40 mg once daily may be underexposed in many critically ill patients, and some protocols use 40 mg twice daily with anti-Xa monitoring to target troughs, so enoxaparin is appropriate but may require higher or monitored dosing in trauma/ICU settings to achieve prophylactic anti-Xa levels [^114Q5nSu].

> For COVID-19, I need to ensure I'm aligned with current guidance; panels recommend prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation with LMWH or UFH rather than intermediate or therapeutic intensity in the absence of confirmed VTE, with enoxaparin 40 mg daily or 40 mg twice daily in higher-risk ICU patients being common, and dose adjustments considered for extremes of weight or renal function, so enoxaparin remains a standard agent here [^112gB2ns] [^1161gjQM] [^113nie4B].

> But wait, what about special populations that change dose selection; in obesity, higher enoxaparin doses (e.g., 60 mg once daily) may be needed to reach prophylactic anti-Xa levels, and in severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min), dose reduction or selection of UFH may be preferred; in pregnancy, LMWH is the prophylactic agent of choice with weight-based dosing adjustments, so I should tailor enoxaparin dosing to these factors rather than use a one-size-fits-all regimen [^112His2h] [^113Sm1Za] [^117Etv6o].

> I should confirm duration principles across scenarios to avoid overgeneralization; for most medical inpatients, prophylaxis continues while hospitalized and is not routinely extended; for major orthopedic surgery, 35 days after hip replacement and 12 days after knee replacement are standard with DOACs and commonly mirrored with LMWH; for major cancer surgery, 28 days is recommended; for trauma, prophylaxis continues until mobility returns; and for COVID-19, prophylaxis continues for the acute illness phase, with extended courses not routine outside trials or specific high-risk contexts [^11239tzh] [^114kr3Ug] [^1117NJHA] [^112gB2ns].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about calling enoxaparin "the drug of choice" universally; I should verify where it is preferred versus merely acceptable: it is strongly favored in cancer-associated thrombosis treatment and inpatient prophylaxis, in trauma/ICU where familiarity and anti-Xa monitoring are practical, and in pregnancy where LMWH is standard; it is an accepted option for general medical and surgical prophylaxis, but in orthopedic surgery and selected ambulatory cancer patients, DOACs are reasonable alternatives, so enoxaparin is best framed as a first-line agent in many but not all prophylaxis settings [^1117NJHA] [^113RgQnF] [^11239tzh] [^114kr3Ug].

> Putting this together, I should double-check the core answer: enoxaparin is a standard, frequently preferred agent for thromboembolism prophylaxis in hospitalized medical patients, surgical patients including those with cancer, trauma/critical illness, and COVID-19, with typical prophylactic dosing of 40 mg subcutaneously once daily for most adults, 30–40 mg once or twice daily in trauma/ICU depending on exposure targets, and 40 mg twice daily in obesity or when anti-Xa monitoring supports adjustment; duration is individualized by setting, commonly aligning with hospitalization for medical patients, 28 days after major cancer surgery, and 35 days after hip replacement or 12 days after knee replacement when following DOAC paradigms, with alternatives like UFH, rivaroxaban, or apixaban considered based on renal function, bleeding risk, and patient-specific factors [^112His2h] [^114Q5nSu] [^1117NJHA] [^11239tzh] [^114kr3Ug].

---

Enoxaparin is a **first-line agent** for thromboembolism prophylaxis in hospitalized medical and surgical patients, including those with cancer and after major orthopedic surgery [^112His2h] [^111MpLru] [^113TFG1f]. The standard prophylactic dose is **40 mg subcutaneously once daily** for most adults, with adjustments for renal impairment, obesity, or high-risk settings [^112His2h]. For cancer surgery, extend prophylaxis to 28 days; for orthopedic surgery, use 35 days after hip replacement and 12 days after knee replacement [^1117NJHA] [^11239tzh] [^114kr3Ug]. Monitor for bleeding and adjust dose in renal impairment or low body weight [^116RFHzg].

---

## Clinical indications for enoxaparin prophylaxis

Enoxaparin is indicated for **VTE prophylaxis** in diverse clinical settings, including:

- **Hospitalized medical patients**: Acutely ill medical inpatients with risk factors for VTE (e.g. heart failure, respiratory failure, infection, immobility) [^112His2h] [^112Uw8g8].
- **Surgical patients**: General surgery, gynecologic surgery, urologic surgery, and especially cancer surgery [^111MpLru] [^112fNr9x].
- **Orthopedic surgery**: Total hip replacement (THR), total knee replacement (TKR), and hip fracture surgery (HFS) [^111WxCnk] [^115qWoSj].
- **Cancer patients**: Both surgical and medical oncology patients at high risk of VTE [^1117NJHA] [^113RgQnF].

---

## Standard prophylactic dosing regimen

The **standard prophylactic dose** of enoxaparin for most adult patients is **40 mg subcutaneously once daily**. This regimen is supported by multiple guidelines and clinical studies demonstrating efficacy and safety in reducing VTE incidence without significantly increasing bleeding risk [^112His2h] [^111NDS8A].

---

## Dose adjustments based on patient-specific factors

Several patient-specific factors necessitate **dose adjustments**:

| **Patient-specific factor** | **Recommended dose adjustment** |
|-|-|
| Renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min) | Reduce dose to 30 mg once daily [^notfound] |
| Obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m²) | Consider 40 mg twice daily or weight-based dosing (0.5 mg/kg twice daily) [^114Q5nSu] |
| Low body weight (< 50 kg) | Consider dose reduction to 30 mg once daily [^notfound] |
| High-risk surgical patients (e.g. cancer surgery) | Consider extended prophylaxis (see duration section below) [^1117NJHA] |

---

## Duration of enoxaparin prophylaxis

The **duration of prophylaxis** varies by clinical scenario:

- **General medical patients**: Prophylaxis is typically administered during hospitalization and discontinued upon discharge, provided the patient is mobile and at low risk of VTE recurrence [^notfound].
- **General surgical patients**: Prophylaxis is typically administered for 7–10 days postoperatively, or until the patient is fully mobile [^notfound].
- **Cancer surgery**: Extended prophylaxis for 28 days postoperatively is recommended for patients undergoing major abdominal or pelvic cancer surgery [^1117NJHA] [^113TFG1f].
- **Orthopedic surgery**: Extended prophylaxis for 35 days after THR or HFS, and 12 days after TKR [^11239tzh] [^114kr3Ug] [^115qWoSj].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting enoxaparin prophylaxis

Enoxaparin prophylaxis is supported by robust clinical evidence demonstrating significant reductions in VTE incidence across multiple patient populations, including hospitalized medical patients, surgical patients, and cancer patients [^112His2h] [^111qdq3s] [^116dY4Ct]. Its efficacy and safety profile are well-established, making it a **preferred agent** for VTE prophylaxis in these settings [^114Q5nSu].

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

While enoxaparin is generally safe, clinicians should monitor for **bleeding complications**, including major and minor bleeding, and for **thrombocytopenia**, particularly heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Regular clinical assessment and laboratory monitoring are recommended, especially in patients with renal impairment, obesity, or high bleeding risk [^113Sm1Za].

---

## Alternative anticoagulants for prophylaxis

Enoxaparin is a first-line agent, but **alternatives** include:

- **Unfractionated heparin (UFH)**: 5,000 units subcutaneously every 8–12 hours, particularly in patients with renal impairment or when rapid reversal is required [^112His2h].
- **Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)**: Rivaroxaban, apixaban, and dabigatran are approved for VTE prophylaxis in specific orthopedic surgery settings and selected medical oncology contexts [^11239tzh] [^114kr3Ug] [^113RgQnF].
- **Mechanical prophylaxis**: Graduated compression stockings (GCS) and intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) devices are recommended when pharmacologic prophylaxis is contraindicated or as adjunctive therapy [^111WxCnk] [^1117NJHA].

---

Enoxaparin is a **first-line agent** for thromboembolism prophylaxis, with a standard dose of 40 mg subcutaneously once daily. Dose adjustments and extended durations are recommended based on patient-specific factors and clinical context, and alternatives are available when enoxaparin is contraindicated or unsuitable.

### Warfarin sodium [^112yVtAk]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Individualized Dosing

The dosage and administration of warfarin sodium must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's International Normalized Ratio (INR) response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines regarding the duration and intensity of anticoagulation for the indicated conditions.

2.2 Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for Individual Indications

An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

Venous Thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE)

Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.

### Deep-vein thrombosis in malignancy: how long should patients be treated, and with what? [^116ACt3W]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2009). Low credibility.

Cancer patients are at high-risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, the optimal VTE prophylaxis and treatment options for this population are currently unclear. Surgical cancer patients have been shown to benefit from pharmacological VTE prophylaxis, with a number of trials suggesting that prophylaxis duration should extend beyond the traditional 7 day period. Medical (nonsurgical) cancer patients are also at high-risk of VTE, and evidence-based guidelines recommend pharmacological VTE prophylaxis in hospitalized cancer patients who are bedridden. In cancer patients with confirmed VTE, questions remain over the most effective long-term treatment regimen. Further trials are required to help physicians to make evidence-based choices for the management of VTE in these patients.

### Duration of anticoagulant therapy for patients with venous thromboembolism [^114evLWq]. Thrombosis Research (2008). Low credibility.

In principle, the answer to this question is obvious: "as long as the risk of continued therapy is outweighed by the benefit". In practice, determining an individual patient's risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) without warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists is difficult. However, there are many factors (both intrinsic and environmental) that can alter the risk of VTE recurrence. This paper will discuss evidence and considerations (including the issue of bleeding risk) that may be relevant to decisions about duration of anticoagulant therapy for patients with VTE.

### Duration of anticoagulant therapy for venous thromboembolism: balancing benefits and harms on the long term [^113Cxs3S]. British Journal of Haematology (2012). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is effectively treated with anticoagulant therapy. After an initial treatment phase, extended treatment is effective to prevent recurrence after a first event but this is at the expense of a continued risk of bleeding. Ideally, patients at a high risk of recurrence and low risk of bleeding continue anticoagulant therapy, and for those at low risk of recurrence the duration of treatment can be limited. Identifying these patients, however, is difficult. Duration of treatment after a first VTE provoked by a transient risk factor should be limited to 3 months. Although guidelines suggest extended treatment for all patients after unprovoked VTE unless bleeding risk is high, we emphasize that the long-term risks of recurrent VTE off anticoagulation are uncertain whereas the risk of bleeding associated with anticoagulant therapy increases with age. In the absence of evidence of replaced mortality or improved quality of life with extended anticoagulant treatment, we suggest a limited duration for most patients after a first VTE. Extended treatment can be considered, based mainly on patient preference.

### Who should get long-term anticoagulant therapy for venous thromboembolism and with what? [^114CL7bq]. Blood Advances (2018). Low credibility.

After an initial 3 to 6 months of anticoagulation for venous thromboembolism (VTE), clinicians and patients face an important question: "Do we stop anticoagulants or continue them indefinitely?" The decision is easy in some scenarios (eg, stop in VTE provoked by major surgery). In most scenarios, which are faced on a day-to-day basis in routine practice, it is a challenging decision because of uncertainty in estimates in the long-term risks (principally major bleeding) and benefits (reducing recurrent VTE) and the tight trade-offs between them. Once the decision is made to continue, the next question to tackle is "Which anticoagulant?" Here again, it is a difficult decision because of the uncertainty with regard to estimates of efficacy and the safety of anticoagulant options and the tight trade-offs between choices. We conclude with the approach that we take in our clinical practice.

### Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in the medical patient: controversies and perspectives [^111NDS8A]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Despite the high morbidity and mortality associated with venous thromboembolism in hospitalized at-risk medical patients, the publication of large-scale studies showing that prophylaxis is effective in this patient group, and the presence of international guidelines, prophylaxis rates in medically ill patients remain suboptimal. Studies show that low-molecular-weight heparins, given once daily, are at least as effective as unfractionated heparin usually given thrice daily with equivalent or improved safety profiles, and that thrice-daily dosing of unfractionated heparin might be more effective than twice-daily dosing. However, the most recent American College of Chest Physicians guidelines do not distinguish between these regimens, and twice-daily unfractionated heparin is still commonly used in the United States. Furthermore, the optimal duration for out-of-hospital and extended prophylaxis for specific patient groups is not established. Finally, there are few data on the use of mechanical methods in this patient group and no established standard of care for prophylaxis of special patient populations, such as obese patients or those with renal insufficiency. Even though prophylaxis entails additional acquisition costs, it can reduce the incidence of venous thromboembolism, which can improve care and decrease overall costs.

2.1 Individualized Dosing

The dosage and administration of JANTOVEN must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's International Normalized Ratio (INR) response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines regarding the duration and intensity of anticoagulation for the indicated conditions.

2.2 Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for Individual Indications

An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

Venous Thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE)

Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.

### Prevention of venous thromboembolism: consensus, controversies, and challenges [^112iuyJN]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2009). Low credibility.

The last 50 years have witnessed a multitude of publications evaluating the efficacy, safety and cost effectiveness of many different thromboprophylaxis interventions. There is widespread consensus that thromboprophylaxis safely reduces morbidity and mortality. More than 25 evidence-based guidelines, published since 1986, also recommend routine thromboprophylaxis in the majority of hospitalized patients. As a result, thromboprophylaxis is recognized as a key safety priority for hospitals. Some of the remaining areas of controversy that will be discussed in this paper include the role of individual risk assessments to determine thrombosis risk and prophylaxis, replacement of low-dose heparin by low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), the optimal duration of prophylaxis, the role of combined thromboprophylaxis modalities, the safety of anticoagulant prophylaxis with regional analgesia, the use of LMWHs in chronic renal insufficiency, and the emerging role of new oral anticoagulants as thromboprophylactic agents. Despite the overwhelming evidence supporting thromboprophylaxis, rates of thromboprophylaxis use remain far from optimal. Successful implementation strategies to bridge this knowledge:care gap are the most important current challenges in this area. These strategies must be multifaceted, utilizing local, systems-based approaches as well as legislation and incentives that reinforce best practices.

2.1 Individualized Dosing

The dosage and administration of COUMADIN must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's INR response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) to assist in the determination of the duration and intensity of anticoagulation with COUMADIN [see References (15)].

2.2 Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for Individual Indications

An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

Venous Thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE)

Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0–3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.

### American Society of Hematology 2021 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: prevention and treatment in patients with cancer [^117SnsD3]. Blood Advances (2021). High credibility.

Long-term anticoagulation — remarks emphasize individualized use: Long-term anticoagulation for secondary VTE prophylaxis should be considered for patients with active cancer. In the absence of contraindications to anticoagulation, such as major bleeding, the panel concluded that the benefits of long-term anticoagulation outweigh the harms. Long-term anticoagulation can be discontinued when patients are entering the last weeks of life. The decision to use long-term anticoagulation will depend on the type and stage of cancer (eg, metastatic or not), overall prognosis, periodic reevaluations of the risk of recurrent VTE and bleeding, comorbidities, costs, and patients' preference. The choice of anticoagulant must also be based on the specific clinical setting to minimize risk, after careful consideration of bleeding risk, drug-drug interactions, patient preference, and the availability of treatment options, including cost considerations.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: a practical guide to common clinical challenges [^116G32bB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Direct oral anticoagulants (s) have quickly become attractive alternatives to the long‐standing standard of care in anticoagulation, vitamin K antagonist.s are indicated for prevention and treatment of several cardiovascular conditions. Since the first approval in 2010, s have emerged as leading therapeutic alternatives that provide both clinicians and patients with more effective, safe, and convenient treatment options in thromboembolic settings. With the expanding role ofs, clinicians are faced with increasingly complex decisions relating to appropriate agent, duration of treatment, and use in special populations. This review will provide an overview ofs and act as a practical reference for clinicians to optimizeuse among common challenging scenarios. Topics addressed include (1) appropriate indications; (2) use in patients with specific comorbidities; (3) monitoring parameters; (4) transitioning between anticoagulant regimens; (5) major drug interactions; and (6) cost considerations.

### Direct oral anticoagulant dose selection: challenging cases [^1165bg7H]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are given in fixed doses without routine laboratory monitoring of their anticoagulant effect based on the results of pivotal phase III trials. In some of these trials, patients were randomly allocated to receive a higher or lower dose of a DOAC, whereas in others, most patients were given a standard dose and only a subset deemed to be at risk of drug accumulation was given a lower dose. Treatment guidelines recommend dosing DOACs according to the way that they were tested in the trials, but for some patients, the optimal dosing remains uncertain. One example is patients with atrial fibrillation who are thought to have an unacceptably high risk of bleeding but do not meet the guideline criteria for dose reduction. A second is patients with venous thromboembolism who have completed 3 to 6 months of anticoagulation and are eligible for extended treatment with a standard or reduced dose of DOAC. In this review, we present a case-based approach to DOAC dose selection in these two settings.

### Prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer [^1143rGA5]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2014). Low credibility.

Robust evidence remains scarce in guiding best practice in the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism in patients living with cancer. Recommendations from major consensus guidelines are largely based on extrapolated data from trials performed mostly in noncancer patients, observational studies and registries, studies using surrogate outcomes, and underpowered randomized controlled trials. Nonetheless, a personalized approach based on individual risk assessment is uniformly recommended for inpatient and outpatient thromboprophylaxis and there is consensus that anticoagulant prophylaxis is warranted in selected patients with a high risk of thrombosis. Prediction tools for estimating the risk of thrombosis in the hospital setting have not been validated, but the use of prophylaxis in the ambulatory setting in those with a high Khorana score is under active investigation. Symptomatic and incidental thrombosis should be treated with anticoagulant therapy, but little is known about the optimal duration. Pharmacologic options for prophylaxis and treatment are still restricted to unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, and vitamin K antagonists because there is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of target-specific, non-vitamin K-antagonist oral anticoagulants. Although these agents offer practical advantages over traditional anticoagulants, potential drug interaction with chemotherapeutic agents, gastrointestinal problems, hepatic and renal impairment, and the lack of rapid reversal agents are important limitations that may reduce the efficacy and safety of these drugs in patients with active cancer. Clinicians and patients are encouraged to participate in clinical trials to advance the care of patients with cancer-associated thrombosis.

### Duration of primary / secondary treatment to prevent recurrent venous thromboembolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116pr7TF]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
Time frame for making decisions regarding anticoagulant treatment. Time frame of the decisions. Initial management (yellow box) spans the first 5 to 21 days following a diagnosis of a new VTE and includes issues concerning whether the patient can be treated at home or it they require admission to the hospital, the use of thrombolytic therapy, whether an inferior vena cava filter needs to be placed, and the initial anticoagulant therapy. During primary treatment, anticoagulant therapy is continued for 3 to 6 months total and represents the minimal duration of treatment for the VTE. After completion of the primary treatment, the next decision concerns whether anticoagulant therapy will be discontinued or if it will be continued for secondary prevention of recurrent VTE. Typically, secondary prevention is continued indefinitely, although patients should be reevaluated on a regular basis to review the benefits and risks of continued anticoagulant therapy. Our choice of terminology reflects the distinct clinical intentions of the different phases of VTE management, linking them to important clinical decisions addressed in the guidelines rather than using terms that reflect the relative duration of therapy. Adapted from the ASH 2020 guidelines for the management of VTE.

Because of the continuing risk for bleeding and the uncertainty regarding the risk for recurrent VTE, it is important to review the evidence to guide decision-making in each of these phases. In the context of developing the recommendations for treatment of VTEs for the ASH guidelines, we systematically reviewed the evidence using standardized inclusion criteria, pooled analysis methods, and assessment of the evidence methods to evaluate decisions for 2 of the 3 therapeutic management phases. Specifically, this review provided the evidence base and updates based on new evidence to support 5 key recommendations in the 2020 ASH VTE treatment guidelines (recommendations 12, 13, 14, 18, and 19; see details in supplemental Table 1). For the primary treatment of VTE, the ASH guideline panel suggests a shorter anticoagulation course (3–6 months) instead of a longer course (> 12 months), regardless of whether the VTE is provoked by a transient or chronic risk factor or if it was unprovoked; for secondary prevention, after completing primary treatment for unprovoked VTE or VTE caused by a chronic risk factor, the panel suggests indefinite antithrombotic therapy over stopping anticoagulation.

### Duration of primary / secondary treatment to prevent recurrent venous thromboembolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111io6em]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis have several strengths. First, it provides the most comprehensive body of evidence, including patients with provoked and unprovoked VTE, for both primary treatment and secondary prevention. Second, it provides the evidence base that supports the 5 key recommendations in the ASH VTE treatment guidelines and includes updates based on the latest evidence. Third, we considered all critical outcomes prioritized by the ASH guideline panel that have extensive clinical and research expertise in VTE treatment. Fourth, we reported both relative and ARR for a variety of patients with VTE (ie, unprovoked or provoked, either caused by transient or chronic risk factors). This could be more informative for patients and clinicians when faced with clinical decision-making for different VTE subgroups. Lastly, we used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence and considered the risk of bias of the included studies. The limitations of this review include the absence of a search for gray literature, although we cross-referenced relevant systematic reviews and RCTs, and this may lead to potential publication bias. Second, we did not assess the health economics or considered patients' values and preferences associated with the duration of anticoagulant therapy, which could offer a different perspective. In addition, we did not prospectively register this study, although a meta-epidemiologic study has shown that prospective registration does not significantly affect the overall reporting quality, although it can at least improve methodologic quality.

Several meta-analyses, have addressed the duration of antithrombotic treatment. None of them, however, clearly distinguished between primary treatment and secondary prevention, which reflects different phases of VTE management and is critical for guiding clinical decision-making. Consequently, they included only 2 to 15 trials, whereas we included 22 unique RCTs of which 10 targeted primary treatment and 16 targeted secondary prevention. Among the current systematic reviews, only 1focused exclusively on unprovoked VTE and concluded that a shorter course (3–6 months) of anticoagulation was encouraged before determining whether to continue with indefinite treatment; the remaining studies included a heterogeneous patient population but did not provide absolute effect estimates for provoked and unprovoked VTE populations, which may lead to limited applicability in clinical practice. In contrast, our research took into account baseline risks for each type of VTE and converted relative effects into absolute effects, thereby making the results more useful for clinical decision-making.

### International clinical practice guidelines for the treatment and prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer [^1117NJHA]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines addressing the management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in cancer patients are heterogeneous and their implementation has been suboptimal worldwide.

Objectives

To establish a common international consensus addressing practical, clinically relevant questions in this setting.

Methods

An international consensus working group of experts was set up to develop guidelines according to an evidence-based medicine approach, using the GRADE system.

Results

For the initial treatment of established VTE: low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is recommended [1B]; fondaparinux and unfractionated heparin (UFH) can be also used [2D]; thrombolysis may only be considered on a case-by-case basis [Best clinical practice (Guidance)]; vena cava filters (VCF) may be considered if contraindication to anticoagulation or pulmonary embolism recurrence under optimal anticoagulation; periodic reassessment of contraindications to anticoagulation is recommended and anticoagulation should be resumed when safe; VCF are not recommended for primary VTE prophylaxis in cancer patients [Guidance]. For the early maintenance (10 days to 3 months) and long-term (beyond 3 months) treatment of established VTE, LMWH for a minimum of 3 months is preferred over vitamin K antagonists (VKA) [1A]; idraparinux is not recommended [2C]; after 3–6 months, LMWH or VKA continuation should be based on individual evaluation of the benefit-risk ratio, tolerability, patient preference and cancer activity [Guidance]. For the treatment of VTE recurrence in cancer patients under anticoagulation, three options can be considered: (i) switch from VKA to LMWH when treated with VKA; (ii) increase in LMWH dose when treated with LMWH, and (iii) VCF insertion [Guidance]. For the prophylaxis of postoperative VTE in surgical cancer patients, use of LMWH o.d. or low dose of UFH t.i.d. is recommended; pharmacological prophylaxis should be started 12–2 h preoperatively and continued for at least 7–10 days; there are no data allowing conclusion that one type of LMWH is superior to another [1A]; there is no evidence to support fondaparinux as an alternative to LMWH [2C]; use of the highest prophylactic dose of LMWH is recommended [1A]; extended prophylaxis (4 weeks) after major laparotomy may be indicated in cancer patients with a high risk of VTE and low risk of bleeding [2B]; the use of LMWH for VTE prevention in cancer patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery may be recommended as for laparotomy [Guidance]; mechanical methods are not recommended as monotherapy except when pharmacological methods are contraindicated [2C]. For the prophylaxis of VTE in hospitalized medical patients with cancer and reduced mobility, we recommend prophylaxis with LMWH, UFH or fondaparinux [1B]; for children and adults with acute lymphocytic leukemia treated with l-asparaginase, depending on local policy and patient characteristics, prophylaxis may be considered in some patients [Guidance]; in patients receiving chemotherapy, prophylaxis is not recommended routinely [1B]; primary pharmacological prophylaxis of VTE may be indicated in patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic [1B] or lung [2B] cancer treated with chemotherapy and having a low risk of bleeding; in patients treated with thalidomide or lenalidomide combined with steroids and/or chemotherapy, VTE prophylaxis is recommended; in this setting, VKA at low or therapeutic doses, LMWH at prophylactic doses and low-dose aspirin have shown similar effects; however, the efficacy of these regimens remains unclear [2C]. Special situations include brain tumors, severe renal failure (CrCl < 30 mL min(-1)), thrombocytopenia and pregnancy. Guidances are provided in these contexts.

Conclusions

Dissemination and implementation of good clinical practice for the management of VTE, the second cause of death in cancer patients, is a major public health priority.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: a practical guide to common clinical challenges [^111iewh1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have quickly become attractive alternatives to the long-standing standard of care in anticoagulation, vitamin K antagonist. DOACs are indicated for prevention and treatment of several cardiovascular conditions. Since the first approval in 2010, DOACs have emerged as leading therapeutic alternatives that provide both clinicians and patients with more effective, safe, and convenient treatment options in thromboembolic settings. With the expanding role of DOACs, clinicians are faced with increasingly complex decisions relating to appropriate agent, duration of treatment, and use in special populations. This review will provide an overview of DOACs and act as a practical reference for clinicians to optimize DOAC use among common challenging scenarios. Topics addressed include (1) appropriate indications; (2) use in patients with specific comorbidities; (3) monitoring parameters; (4) transitioning between anticoagulant regimens; (5) major drug interactions; and (6) cost considerations.

### Regional anesthesia in the patient receiving antithrombotic or thrombolytic therapy: American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine evidence-based guidelines (fifth edition) [^1131ZzjT]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Current recommendations for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) — hospitalized patient risk and guideline context are summarized as follows: "VTE is an important health problem and a significant source of morbidity and mortality". "Nearly all hospitalized patients have at least one risk factor for thromboembolism and approximately 40% have three or more risk factors (table 2)". "Consequently, the majority of hospitalized patients are candidates for thromboprophylaxis". "In 2012, the ACCP published guidelines for VTE prophylaxis in medical, surgical, and orthopedic surgical patients". "Recent updates published in 2016 and 2021 provide no additional guidance on this topic". Choice of prophylaxis is individualized: "The type of agent, dosing regimen, and duration of thromboprophylaxis is based on identification of risk factors, both individual (eg, age, gender, history of thromboembolism) and group-specific (eg, primary reason for hospitalization, surgery, medical illness)", and "Depending on the risks of thromboembolism and bleeding, thromboprophylaxis may be achieved with intermittent compression devices, with medications, or a combination of both".

### Duration of anticoagulation therapy for venous thromboembolism [^112na45n]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2008). Low credibility.

Treatment of acute deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism-often denominated together as venous thromboembolism (VTE)- consists of parenteral administration of heparin (usually low-molecular-weight heparin or alternatively unfractionated heparin or fondaparinux) overlapped and followed by oral vitamin K antagonists that are administered for a certain period (usually 3 to 12 months). Recommended or suggested durations differ according to guidelines. Practically, the clinical decision in an individual patient depends upon the estimated risks of VTE recurrence and treatment-induced bleeding. The risk of VTE recurrence is higher in idiopathic events (about 10% per year during the first two years and 3% per year thereafter) (odds ratio of 2.4, compared to secondary events); in male subjects (at least before the age of 60, with an odds ratio of 2–4); in patients with persistently elevated D-dimer level (odds ratio of 2.3, compared with normal level); and during the first two years after discontinuation of treatment. The annual risk of major bleeding on anticoagulant treatment vary largely in observational studies with figures of 2% to 29%, depending on the patient characteristics. The case-fatality rate is 8% (DVT), 12% (PE) for recurrent VTE, and about 10% for major bleed. These figures do not support long-term anticoagulant therapy, except in those patients exhibiting a very high risk of recurrence and/or a very low risk of bleeding. New therapeutic aspects might impact on the duration of anticoagulant therapy after a venous thromboembolic event. They include the possibility of pursuing anticoagulant treatment at a reduced INR after an initial period with an INR 2–3, and the advent of new, more specific and orally active anticoagulants. These features might modify the risk-benefit balance of extending anticoagulant therapy beyond the usual, limited duration.

### Methodology for the development of antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis guidelines: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^112AqvQZ]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Values and preferences in AT9 recommendations — each chapter includes a summary, quantitative wherever possible, of the key values and preferences, and when judgments are particularly relevant or controversial, explicit statements accompany individual recommendations. Because studies showed extensive heterogeneity of patient values and preferences, the developers mandated circumspection in making strong recommendations and "restricted strong recommendations to situations in which the desirable consequences of an intervention substantially and convincingly outweighed the undesirable consequences (or the reverse)" and to unusual situations in which values and preferences are relatively uniform.

### Anticoagulants (extended duration) for prevention of venous thromboembolism following total hip or knee replacement or hip fracture repair [^115qWoSj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of thromboprophylaxis after total hip or knee replacement, or hip fracture repair remains controversial. It is common practice to administer prophylaxis using low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) until discharge from hospital, usually seven to 14 days after surgery. International guidelines recommend extending thromboprophylaxis for up to 35 days following major orthopaedic surgery but the recommendation is weak due to moderate quality evidence. In addition, recent oral anticoagulants that exert effect by direct inhibition of thrombin or activated factor X lack the need for monitoring and have few known drug interactions. Interest in this topic remains high.

Objectives

To assess the effects of extended-duration anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in people undergoing elective hip or knee replacement surgery, or hip fracture repair.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Specialised Register (last searched May 2015) and CENTRAL (2015, Issue 4). Clinical trials databases were searched for ongoing or unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials assessing extended-duration thromboprophylaxis (five to seven weeks) using accepted prophylactic doses of LMWH, UFH, vitamin K antagonists (VKA) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) compared with short-duration thromboprophylaxis (seven to 14 days) followed by placebo, no treatment or similar extended-duration thromboprophylaxis with LMWH, UFH, VKA or DOACs in participants undergoing hip or knee replacement or hip fracture repair.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently selected trials and extracted data. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. We performed fixed-effect model meta-analyses with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used a random-effects model when there was heterogeneity.

Main Results

We included 16 studies (24,930 participants); six compared heparin with placebo, one compared VKA with placebo, two compared DOAC with placebo, one compared VKA with heparin, five compared DOAC with heparin and one compared anticoagulants chosen at investigators' discretion with placebo. Three trials included participants undergoing knee replacement. No studies assessed hip fracture repair. Trials were generally of good methodological quality. The main reason for unclear risk of bias was insufficient reporting. The quality of evidence according to GRADE was generally moderate, as some comparisons included a single study, low number of events or heterogeneity between studies leading to wide CIs. We showed no difference between extended-duration heparin and placebo in symptomatic VTE (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.01; 2329 participants; 5 studies; high quality evidence), symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.38; 2019 participants; 4 studies; moderate quality evidence), symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.33; 1595 participants; 3 studies; low quality evidence) and major bleeding (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.46; 2500 participants; 5 studies; moderate quality evidence). Minor bleeding was increased in the heparin group (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.43 to 2.81; 2500 participants; 5 studies; high quality evidence). Clinically relevant non-major bleeding was not reported. We showed no difference between extended-duration VKA and placebo (one study, 360 participants) for symptomatic VTE (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.94; moderate quality evidence), symptomatic DVT (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.62; moderate quality evidence), symptomatic PE (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.84; moderate quality evidence) and major bleeding (OR 2.89, 95% CI 0.12 to 71.31; low quality evidence). Clinically relevant non-major bleeding and minor bleeding were not reported. Extended-duration DOAC showed reduced symptomatic VTE (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.68; 2419 participants; 1 study; moderate quality evidence) and symptomatic DVT (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.81; 2459 participants; 2 studies; high quality evidence) compared to placebo. No differences were found for symptomatic PE (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.25; 1733 participants; 1 study; low quality evidence), major bleeding (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.06 to 16.02; 2457 participants; 1 study; low quality evidence), clinically relevant non-major bleeding (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.95; 2457 participants; 1 study; moderate quality evidence) and minor bleeding (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.88; 2457 participants; 1 study; moderate quality evidence). We showed no difference between extended-duration anticoagulants chosen at investigators' discretion and placebo (one study, 557 participants, low quality evidence) for symptomatic VTE (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.74), symptomatic DVT (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.03 to 3.21), symptomatic PE (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.06 to 16.13), and major bleeding (OR 5.05, 95% CI 0.24 to 105.76). Clinically relevant non-major bleeding and minor bleeding were not reported. We showed no difference between extended-duration VKA and heparin (one study, low quality evidence) for symptomatic VTE (OR 1.64, 95% CI 0.85 to 3.16; 1279 participants), symptomatic DVT (OR 1.36, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.68; 1279 participants), symptomatic PE (OR 9.16, 95% CI 0.49 to 170.42; 1279 participants), major bleeding (OR 3.87, 95% CI 1.91 to 7.85; 1272 participants) and minor bleeding (OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.76; 1279 participants). Clinically relevant non-major bleeding was not reported. We showed no difference between extended-duration DOAC and heparin for symptomatic VTE (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.70; 15,977 participants; 5 studies; low quality evidence), symptomatic DVT (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.11 to 3.27; 15,977 participants; 5 studies; low quality evidence), symptomatic PE (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.94; 14,731 participants; 5 studies; moderate quality evidence), major bleeding (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.54; 16,199 participants; 5 studies; high quality evidence), clinically relevant non-major bleeding (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.28; 15,241 participants; 4 studies; high quality evidence) and minor bleeding (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.10; 11,766 participants; 4 studies; high quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate quality evidence suggests extended-duration anticoagulants to prevent VTE should be considered for people undergoing hip replacement surgery, although the benefit should be weighed against the increased risk of minor bleeding. Further studies are needed to better understand the association between VTE and extended-duration oral anticoagulants in relation to knee replacement and hip fracture repair, as well as outcomes such as distal and proximal DVT, reoperation, wound infection and healing.

### Is there a role for low-dose DOACs as prophylaxis? [^114aCyez]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Medium credibility.

The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have transformed the management of thrombotic disorders. Large clinical trials have demonstrated that DOACs can replace vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in the 2 existing major indications for anticoagulation: the prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation and the acute treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE); this literature is widely known. In this article, we will concentrate on the less well-discussed benefits of the use of DOACs-using low doses as primary and secondary prophylaxis in both venous and arterial thromboprophylaxis. The attractiveness of using a low-dose DOAC is that the bleeding risk seems to be slightly lower than with the standard dose and significantly lower than with VKAs so that they can be used safely for long periods, where previously, VKAs had risk/benefit ratios that did not permit this. We discuss in detail the extended use of low-dose DOACs in secondary VTE prevention. We also cover the utility of low-dose DOACs in the evolving fields of prevention of hospital-associated VTE in acutely ill medical patients, after total hip and knee replacement, and in cancer patients. To complete the indications, we briefly discuss the role of low-dose DOACs in the secondary prevention of arterial vascular events.

### Methodology for the development of antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis guidelines: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^114DMMZJ]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Values and preferences — antithrombotic therapy guideline development emphasizes that making trade-offs between desirable and undesirable consequences of alternative management strategies requires value and preference judgments; for antithrombotic therapy this trade-off involves a reduction in thrombotic events compared with an increase in bleeding events, and greater variability in patient values increases the likelihood that a weak recommendation is appropriate; to inform these decisions, the authors conducted a systematic review and had panelists rate outcomes from 0 (death) to 100 (full health).

### Standard-versus extended-duration anticoagulation for primary venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients [^1148Jfis]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) includes two interrelated conditions, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Risk factors include dehydration, prolonged immobilization, acute medical illness, trauma, clotting disorders, previous thrombosis, varicose veins with superficial vein thrombosis, exogenous hormones, malignancy, chemotherapy, infection, inflammation, pregnancy, obesity, smoking, and advancing age. It is estimated that hospitalized patients are 100 times more likely to develop VTE and, compared with surgical patients, medical patients often have more severe forms of VTE. VTE carries a significant risk of morbidity and mortality. Prophylactic strategies, including mechanical and pharmacological methods, are recommended for patients at risk of VTE. Pharmacological prophylaxis is considered the standard practice for acutely ill medical patients at risk of developing VTE in the absence of contraindications. For hospitalized patients, the risk of VTE extends beyond hospital stay and up to 90 days, with most events occurring within 45 days of discharge. Despite that, it remains unclear whether extended-duration anticoagulation for primary VTE prophylaxis would provide benefits without added risks or harm.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and risks of standard- versus extended-duration anticoagulation for primary VTE prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Web of Science databases, as well as the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers up to 27 March 2023. We also searched reference lists of all included studies for additional references and searched the last five years of the American Society of Hematology conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing standard-duration versus extended-duration anticoagulation for primary VTE prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients (adults being treated in a medical inpatient setting).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures set by Cochrane. At least two authors independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion and performed data extraction. Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias (RoB) using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. We analyzed outcomes data using the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. Our outcomes of interest were assessed in the short term (during the treatment period and within 45 days of hospitalization) and long term (assessed beyond 45 days of hospitalization). Primary outcomes were symptomatic VTE, major bleeding, and all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were total VTE, a composite of fatal and irreversible vascular events (including myocardial infarction, non-fatal PE, cardiopulmonary death, stroke), fatal bleeding, and VTE-related mortality.

Main Results

A total of seven RCTs fulfilled our inclusion criteria, comprising 40,846 participants. All studies contributing data to our outcomes were at low risk of bias in all domains. Most studies reported the outcomes in the short term. Extended-duration anticoagulation, compared with standard-duration anticoagulation, for primary VTE prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients reduced the risk of short-term symptomatic VTE (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.78; standard-duration 12 per 1000, extended-duration 7 per 1000, 95% CI 6 to 10; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome [NNTB] 204, 95% CI 136 to 409; 4 studies, 24,773 participants; high-certainty evidence). This benefit, however, was offset by an increased risk of short-term major bleeding (RR 2.05, 95% CI 1.51 to 2.79; standard-duration 3 per 1000, extended duration 6 per 1000, 95% CI 5 to 8; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome [NNTH] 314, 95% CI 538 to 222; 7 studies, 40,374 participants; high-certainty evidence). Extended-duration anticoagulation, compared with standard-duration, results in little to no difference in short-term all-cause mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.08; standard-duration 34 per 1000, extended-duration 33 per 1000, 95% CI 30 to 37; 5 studies, 38,080 participants; high-certainty evidence), reduced short-term total VTE (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.85; standard-duration 37 per 1000, extended duration 28 per 1000, 95% CI 25 to 32; NNTB 107, 95% CI 76 to 178; 5 studies, 33,819 participants; high-certainty evidence), and short-term composite of fatal and irreversible vascular events (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.91; standard-duration 41 per 1000, extended-duration 29 per 1000, 95% CI 23 to 37; NNTB 85, 95% CI 50 to 288; 1 study, 7513 participants; high-certainty evidence). Extended-duration anticoagulation may result in little to no difference in short-term fatal bleeding (RR 2.28, 95% CI 0.84 to 6.22; standard-duration 0 per 1000, extended-duration 0 per 1000, 95% CI 0 to 1; 7 studies, 40,374 participants; low-certainty evidence), and likely results in little to no difference in short-term VTE-related mortality (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.05; standard-duration 5 per 1000, extended-duration 4 per 1000 95% CI 3 to 6; 6 studies, 36,170 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

In the short term, extended- versus standard-duration anticoagulation for primary VTE prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients reduced the risk of symptomatic VTE at the expense of an increased risk of major bleeding. Extended-duration anticoagulation resulted in little to no difference in all-cause mortality. Extended-duration anticoagulation reduced the risk of total VTE and the composite of fatal and irreversible vascular events, but may show little to no difference in fatal bleeding and VTE-related mortality. Further data, with longer follow-up, are needed to determine the optimal agent and duration for primary VTE prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients.

Evaluating quality of bodies of evidence — evidence across studies was assessed on an outcome-by-outcome basis using criteria from the GRADE Working Group, with RCTs starting as high-quality evidence and observational studies as low-quality evidence; ratings could be affected by risk of bias, precision, consistency, directness, publication bias, and very large effects, and the ACCP adaptation classifies body-of-evidence quality as high (A), moderate (B), or low (C), while GRADE also provides a very-low-quality category; quality often differed by outcome (e.g., thienopyridines vs warfarin showed moderate quality for mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and revascularization but low for major bleeding), and the overall rating for each recommendation used the lowest quality among outcomes judged critical.

### Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in medical patients: future perspectives [^1159MVVB]. Thrombosis Research (2005). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism is a common potentially life-threatening complication in acutely ill medical patients. Actually, over 70% fatal episodes of pulmonary embolism during hospitalization occur in non-surgical patients. In the absence of thromboprophylaxis, the incidence of venographically detected deep vein thrombosis is about 15% in medical patients and several trials and meta-analyses have clearly demonstrated the prophylactic role of unfractioned heparin and low-molecular-weight heparins. Although over the last years the knowledge of epidemiology, clinical features and prophylaxis in medical patients has significantly improved, there are still several relevant issues to investigate thoroughly. Scarce data are available on a simple way to stratify patients in order to identify those who should undergo prophylaxis and several studies clearly show that thromboprophylaxis in medical conditions is underused. Moreover, in comparison to surgical settings, very few randomized clinical trials on the efficacy of pharmacologic prophylaxis have been performed and no data at all have been published concerning mechanical prophylaxis in medical conditions. According to previous studies and results of very recently published trials, new data are available to tailor low molecular weight heparin optimal dose, whereas the optimal duration of prophylaxis in medical patients is still a matter of debate. Moreover, the possible role of the new antithrombotic drugs in the venous thromboembolism prevention in medical conditions and the optimal management of thromboprophylaxis in patients with ischaemic stroke have not been fully investigated. Although new evidence represents a significant improvement both in stratification of VTE risk and in decisions about the appropriate type and duration of prophylactic strategies in medical patients, additional data are still needed.

### Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis and treatment in patients with cancer: ASCO guideline update [^113RgQnF]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis — ambulatory patients during systemic chemotherapy: Routine pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis should not be offered to all outpatients with cancer. High-risk outpatients with cancer (Khorana score of 2 or higher before starting a new systemic chemotherapy regimen) may be offered thromboprophylaxis with apixaban, rivaroxaban, or LMWH provided there are no significant risk factors for bleeding and no drug interactions, and consideration should include discussion of relative benefits and harms, drug cost, and duration of prophylaxis in this setting. Patients with multiple myeloma receiving thalidomide- or lenalidomide-based regimens with chemotherapy and/or dexamethasone should be offered pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis with either aspirin or LMWH for lower-risk patients and LMWH for higher-risk patients.

### American Society of Hematology living guidelines on the use of anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19: may 2021 update on the use of intermediate-intensity anticoagulation in critically ill patients [^115VLwKt]. Blood Advances (2021). High credibility.

American Society of Hematology COVID-19 critically ill — evidence-to-decision considerations and recommendation indicate low certainty in overall effects and favor prophylactic-intensity dosing. Overall, the panel judged that there was low certainty evidence in the desirable and undesirable effects of intermediate-intensity anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19–related critical illness, with a suggestion of a reduction in PE but the opposite observed for DVT. Given low certainty for benefit versus a moderate risk of major bleeding complications, the usual practice of prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation was suggested, with individualized decisions based on thrombosis and bleeding risk. Dose adjustment of prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation for extremes of body weight or renal impairment may also be considered. This recommendation does not apply to thrombotic complications related to extracorporeal circuits.

### Thromboprophylaxis rates in US medical centers: success or failure? [^113cHdqf]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2007). Low credibility.

Background

As hospitalized medical patients may be at risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), evidence-based guidelines are available to help physicians assess patients' risk for VTE, and to recommend prophylaxis options. The rate of appropriate thromboprophylaxis use in at-risk medical inpatients was assessed in accordance with the 6th American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines.

Methods

Hospital discharge information from the Premier Perspective(trade mark) inpatient data base from January 2002 to September 2005 was used. Included patients were 40 years old or more, with a length of hospital stay of 6 days or more, and had no contraindications for anticoagulation. The appropriateness of VTE thromboprophylaxis was determined in seven groups with acute medical conditions by comparing the daily thromboprophylaxis usage, including type of thromboprophylaxis, dosage of anticoagulant and duration of thromboprophylaxis, with the ACCP recommendations.

Results

A total of 196 104 discharges from 227 hospitals met the inclusion criteria. The overall VTE thromboprophylaxis rate was 61.8%, although the appropriate thromboprophylaxis rate was only 33.9%. Of the 66.1% discharged patients who did not receive appropriate thromboprophylaxis, 38.4% received no prophylaxis, 4.7% received mechanical prophylaxis only, 6.3% received an inappropriate dosage, and 16.7% received an inappropriate prophylaxis duration based on ACCP recommendations.

Conclusions

This study highlights the low rates of appropriate thromboprophylaxis in US acute-care hospitals, with two-thirds of discharged patients not receiving prophylaxis in accordance with the 6th ACCP guidelines. More effort is required to improve the use of appropriate thromboprophylaxis in accordance with the ACCP recommendations.

### Methodology for the development of antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis guidelines: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^1171tYZq]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Evaluating quality of bodies of evidence — GRADE approach and ACCP adaptation are described as follows: Evidence was assessed "across studies on an outcome-by-outcome basis using criteria suggested by the GRADE Working Group", and quality of evidence was defined as "our confidence in the estimate of the effect to support a recommendation". "RCTs start as high-quality evidence and observational studies as low-quality evidence", with additional factors including "risk of bias… precision, consistency, and directness of results; likelihood of publication bias; and presence of very large effects". The ACCP adaptation differs in that "the quality of a body of evidence can be high (A), moderate (B), or low (C); GRADE also provides a category for very-low-quality evidence". Quality may differ by outcome, for example for "thienopyridines vs warfarin… moderate quality for mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and revascularization but of low quality for major bleeding". For each clinical question, they rated "the quality of the entire body of evidence", and "quality for each recommendation was the lowest quality rating of the outcomes judged as critical".

### Thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19: a brief update to the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111tAEoa]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

CHEST guideline update — COVID-19 thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized patients provides separate guidance statements for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention for hospitalized patients with acute (moderate) illness and critically ill patients in the ICU, and divides each original question and resulting recommendation into two questions: standard prophylaxis vs therapeutic (or escalated dose) prophylaxis and standard prophylaxis vs intermediate dose prophylaxis. Critically ill patients should receive standard thromboprophylaxis for VTE, moderately ill patients with a low bleeding risk might benefit from therapeutic heparin, and "We see no role for intermediate dose thromboprophylaxis in either setting". This update led to a change in one recommendation and an upgrading of three additional recommendations based upon higher quality evidence.

Dabigatran initiation and maintenance — dose selection, efficacy, and approvals: Dabigatran exetilate offers dosing options evaluated in phase III studies — 150 mg and 220 mg once daily for postoperative VTE prevention, 150 mg bid for VTE treatment, and 110 mg and 150 mg bid in AF. In AF, 150 mg bid was superior to warfarin and 110 mg bid was noninferior; major bleeding rates were similar with 150 mg and warfarin but significantly less with 110 mg. Only the 150-mg dose was approved in the United States, whereas in Canada both doses are approved. For prophylaxis after major joint replacement, dosing level had less apparent effect on efficacy or surgical bleeding when compared with 40 mg/d enoxaparin. Subgroup analyses provided little evidence for clinically important effects of age, gender, or renal function within dosing levels; for example, a lower dose may be preferred for elderly patients with a mild to moderate decrease of renal function, and the choice will be influenced by known drug interactions.

Guideline Recommendations for Treatment and Prevention of Cancer-Associated Venous Thromboembolism

The key indications for treatment and prevention of CAT published by major scientific societies since 2019 are summarized in Table 2.

Table 2
Key recommendations of the latest guidelines for treatment and prevention of cancer-associated venous thromboembolism

DOAC direct oral anticoagulants; LMWH low-molecular-weight heparin; VKA vitamin K antagonists; VTE venous thromboembolism

Rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and apixaban have been added as therapeutic options for VTE in cancer patients after the presentation of the results of the landmark RCTs, and currently they are the first choice. With variable emphasis, guidelines advocate caution in using DOAC in subjects with gastrointestinal malignancies, especially of the upper gastrointestinal tract, or when significant interactions are expected with other drugs. DOAC or LMWH are suggested for prolonged anticoagulation beyond 6 months, after careful assessment of potential benefits and risks.

All guidelines propose primary prophylaxis with apixaban or rivaroxaban in patients at high risk of thrombosis, but not of bleeding, receiving systemic anticancer therapy. The susceptibility to CAT is mostly defined by a Khorana score ≥ 2, but also by specific cancer types, such as advanced pancreatic cancer.

### Treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism in cancer [^114NX4gL]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

The use of anticoagulation in the thrombocytopenic patient remains challenging. Different options can be considered. For example, the label for dalteparin recommends a reduction in daily dose of 2500 IU if the platelet count falls to 50–100 × 10 9 /l, until it recovers to ⩾100 × 10 9 /l, and discontinuation if the platelet count falls to < 50 × 10 9 /l. In a prospective cohort study, 203 patients with metastatic cancer and VTE received LMWH at treatment dose for 1 week. The dose was then reduced to 10 000 IU daily, irrespective of weight, for 3 months. The dose was further reduced to 5000 IU daily at platelet counts < 50 × 10 9 /l and to 2500 at counts < 10 × 10 9 /l. Recurrent VTE developed in 9% of patients (fatal in two patients). Five percent had a major bleed (fatal in six patients). Although unsupported by specific data, others have recommended a 50% dose reduction of LMWH if the platelet count is < 50 × 10 9 /l and discontinuation if the platelet count is < 20 × 10 9 /l.

Consideration should be given to insertion of a vena caval filter if anticoagulation is contraindicated because of thrombocytopenia or active bleeding, but again firm data are lacking. Thus, the optimal approach to management of VTE in this setting is uncertain. In individual circumstances in which there is a clear wish not to interrupt LMWH therapy, it may be reasonable to continue at a slightly reduced dose with platelet support to maintain the count > 50 × 10 9 /l and to reduce to a prophylactic dose, discontinue LMWH, or consider insertion of a vena caval filter if this is not possible.

Duration of anticoagulant therapy

The optimal duration of anticoagulant therapy for prevention of recurrent VTE in patients with cancer has not been specifically studied. Guidelines recommend that it should continue as long as the patient has active cancer. In practice, this means indefinite treatments in patients with metastases or in those receiving anticancer therapy. However, each patient should be assessed individually in terms of the risk/benefit ratio of continuing vs stopping anticoagulants, life expectancy, quality of life, and patient preference. The CLOT trial data referred to earlier in favour of LMWH over oral anticoagulation did not extend beyond 6 months. It seems likely that the benefit of LMWH would extend beyond this period if continuing anticoagulation is required, but consideration may be given to oral anticoagulant therapy in individual instances.

2.1 Recommended Dose

Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation The recommended dose of apixaban tablets for most patients is 5 mg taken orally twice daily.

The recommended dose of apixaban tablets is 2.5 mg twice daily in patients with at least two of the following characteristics:

- age greater than or equal to 80 years

- body weight less than or equal to 60 kg

- serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL

Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis Following Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery

The recommended dose of apixaban tablets is 2.5 mg taken orally twice daily. The initial dose should be taken 12 to 24 hours after surgery.

- In patients undergoing hip replacement surgery, the recommended duration of treatment is 35 days.

- In patients undergoing knee replacement surgery, the recommended duration of treatment is 12 days.

Treatment of DVT and PE

The recommended dose of apixaban tablets is 10 mg taken orally twice daily for the first 7 days of therapy. After 7 days, the recommended dose is 5 mg taken orally twice daily.

Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of DVT and PE

The recommended dose of apixaban tablets is 2.5 mg taken orally twice daily after at least 6 months of treatment for DVT or PE [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

2.2 Missed Dose

If a dose of apixaban tablets is not taken at the scheduled time, the dose should be taken as soon as possible on the same day and twice-daily administration should be resumed. The dose should not be doubled to make up for a missed dose.

2.3 Temporary Interruption for Surgery and Other Interventions

Apixaban tablets should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a moderate or high risk of unacceptable or clinically significant bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Apixaban tablets should be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a low risk of bleeding or where the bleeding would be non-critical in location and easily controlled. Bridging anticoagulation during the 24 to 48 hours after stopping apixaban tablets and prior to the intervention is not generally required. Apixaban tablets should be restarted after the surgical or other procedures as soon as adequate hemostasis has been established.

### Thrombosis in multiple myeloma: risk stratification, antithrombotic prophylaxis, and management of acute events. A consensus-based position paper from anexpert panel [^111m1fRy]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the light of new therapies for MM, key clinically relevant questions regarding MM-associated thrombosis were identified, and recommendations were formulated by a panel of experts in the field. Although several scientific bodies have provided guidance on how to optimize thromboprophylaxis in MM patients, the panel highlighted the high degree of uncertainty regarding risk stratification and thromboprophylaxis in MM patients. Since the existing scientific literature about thromboprophylaxis in MM does not allow evidence-based recommendations, consensus was a critical part of the production of the present re-commendations.

Box 3. Recommendations regarding early treatment of acute thrombotic events, secondary antithrombotic prophylaxis, and re-exposure to anti-myeloma drug in patients with multiple myeloma.

Patients with multiple myeloma on secondary prophylaxis with long-term oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists or direct oral anticoagulants, should continue with their anticoagulation treatment during anti-myeloma therapy.
Patients on anti-platelet therapy (single or double agents) because of previous arterial ischemic events should continue their ongoing anti-platelet prophylaxis. They should add a low molecular weight heparin after a careful evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio during anti-myeloma treatment. The use of low molecular weight heparin should be considered as long as the myeloma disease burden remains high.
Patients with a history of provoked venous thromboembolism or of thrombosis of superficial veins not receiving oral anticoagulation should receive a short-term course of prophylactic low molecular weight heparin (4–6 months) followed by aspirin 100 mg/day during anti-myeloma treatment.
Patients with a history of unprovoked venous thromboembolism not receiving oral anticoagulation who have normal renal function may be treated with a low molecular weight heparin, vitamin K antagonist or a direct oral anticoagulant (apixaban). The choice should be based on pharmacological interactions and risk of bleeding.
In patients with a history of unprovoked venous thromboembolism who have started low molecular weight heparin or oral anticoagulation as thromboprophylaxis after a diagnosis of multiple myeloma, the decision to change to aspirin after 6 months or to continue with oral anticoagulation during long-term treatment with immunomodulatory drugs should be evaluated case by case.
In general, the treatment of acute thrombosis during active treatment for multiple myeloma should not be diferent from that usually recommended.
Patients with multiple myeloma and non-life-threatening venous thromboembolism during therapy with immunomodulatory drugs should continue the therapy and receive long-term anticoagulation.
In the case of life-threatening venous thromboembolism or arterial thrombosis during treatment with immunomodulatory drugs, a careful case-by-case evaluation should be made, considering the response of the multiple myeloma disease to immunomodulatory drugs, the severity of the thrombosis, and the patient's risk profile for future events.
In multiple myeloma patients with acute venous thromboembolism, the duration of anticoagulant treatment should be at least 6 months or indefinite in the case of ongoing treatment with immunomodulatory drugs.
In active multiple myeloma with a high burden of disease, patients should continue the anticoagulant treatment even after 6 months until response of the myeloma disease.
As regards the platelet count during secondary thromboprophylaxis, the same recommendations as for primary thromboprophylaxis should be followed.
In the case of acute venous thromboembolism and severe thrombocytopenia, the placement of a retrievable inferior vena cava filter is suggested until safe anticoagulation is possible, and the filter can be removed.
In patients with renal insufciency (with or without ongoing dialysis) the most appropriate secondary antithrombotic prophylaxis after venous thromboembolism is adjusted-dose low molecular weight heparin or a vitamin K antagonist.

ASCO guideline — Initial anticoagulation for established VTE in cancer states that initial anticoagulation may involve low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), unfractionated heparin (UFH), fondaparinux, rivaroxaban, or apixaban. For patients initiating treatment with parenteral anticoagulation, LMWH is preferred over UFH for the initial 5–10 days of anticoagulation for the patient with cancer with newly diagnosed VTE who does not have severe renal impairment (defined as creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min; Type: Evidence based; Evidence quality: High; Strength of recommendation: Strong).

### Thrombosis in multiple myeloma: risk stratification, antithrombotic prophylaxis, and management of acute events. A consensus-based position paper from anexpert panel [^115S8MKR]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Box 2. Recommendations regarding primary antithrombotic prophylaxis in patients with multiple myeloma.

All patients with multiple myeloma who are candidates for active anti-myeloma treatment should be considered for thromboprophylaxis.
The type, intensity and duration of thromboprophylaxis should be tailored according to the individual's baseline thrombotic and hemorrhagic risk profiles.
Severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 20x10 9 /L), active bleeding, congenital bleeding disorders (hemophilia, von Willebrand disease, severe deficiency of coagulation factors), and acquired coagulopathy that cannot be corrected (e.g. severe liver disease) are absolute contraindications to thromboprophylaxis.
Mild thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 50x10 9 /L), a history of bleeding, and acquired coagulopathy with a chance of correction are relative contraindications to thromboprophylaxis.
To ensure appropriate, safe and efective thromboprophylaxis and to avoid the risks of bleeding and potential thrombotic complications, it is recommended that the drug-drug interactions of antithrombotic agents and antimyeloma drugs are considered.
Patients' compliance and patients' preferences should be considered in the choice of thromboprophylaxis, and patients should be adequately informed about their thrombotic risk.
Patients at low risk of thrombosis, i.e. those aged less than 75 years, with a normal body mass index, without fractures, a central venous catheter, or co-morbidities and not planned to receive therapy with immunomodulatory drugs, should not be given thromboprophylaxis or can be given thromboprophylaxis with low-dose aspirin. The criterion for the choice is the individual hemorrhagic risk.
All other patients should receive thromboprophylaxis, with low molecular weight heparin as the first choice.
Patients without other risk factors for thrombosis except for a planned therapy containing an immunomodulatory drug and with a contraindication, strong aversion or documented poor compliance to low molecular weight heparin therapy, could be given aspirin as thromboprophylaxis.
Preliminary data on the efcacy and safety of apixaban and rivaroxaban as primary thromboprophylaxis in patients receiving immunomodulatory drugs are promising. However, there is no strong evidence in favor of direct oral anticoagulants instead of a low molecular weight heparin.
Of-label prescription of apixaban as primary antithrombotic prophylaxis in patients with contraindications to low molecular weight heparin (e.g. for allergy) should be considered.
The duration of thromboprophylaxis should be modulated according to the length of anti-myeloma treatment and evolving risk factors. Prophylaxis should continue as long as a thrombotic risk is present (e.g. active disease or assumption of drugs with a thrombotic risk).
Patients with relapsed multiple myeloma should receive thromboprophylaxis during the treatment according to the indications recommended for newly diagnosed patients.
For patients under lenalidomide maintenance, thromboprophylaxis is indicated even if thromboembolic events are less frequent than during newly diagnosed disease. In these patients, prophylactic aspirin 100 mg/day is recommended.
In patients with renal insufciency, the most appropriate prophylaxis should be chosen according to the degree of renal function. For patients with a creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min, low molecular weight heparin with dose adjustments is the preferred prophylaxis. Dose adjustments of low molecular weight heparin according to creatinine clearance value are recommended (Table 5).
During antithrombotic prophylaxis, the platelet count should be monitored, particularly in patients receiving antimyeloma therapeutic combinations that are at high risk of causing thrombocytopenia.
Thromboprophylaxis should be stopped if the platelet count decreases to less than 20–30x10 9 /L. Dose reductions should be applied when the platelet count is 30–50x10 9 /L. Full-dose thromboprophylaxis can be used when the platelet count is over 50x10 9 /L.
Primary thromboprophylaxis should be stopped in the case of clinically relevant or major bleeding. In this circumstance, the cause of bleeding should be evaluated and eventually corrected before restarting thromboprophylaxis.

Patient sex and D-dimer measured a month after stopping may influence stop vs extend decisions, and in all who receive extended therapy, the continuing use of treatment should be reassessed at periodic intervals (eg, annually).

### Duration of primary / secondary treatment to prevent recurrent venous thromboembolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113jPCYp]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Eligibility criteria

Studies were eligible if they included adult patients (≥ 18 years of age) diagnosed with primary or recurrent VTE that was unprovoked, provoked by transient risk factors, or provoked by chronic risk factors. Studies were included if they evaluated the duration of anticoagulation (direct oral anticoagulants [DOAC] or vitamin K antagonist [VKA]/low molecular weight heparin [LMWH]) for the primary treatment period (3–6 months vs > 6 months duration) or the duration of antithrombotic treatment (DOAC, VKA/LMWH, or antiplatelet) during the secondary prevention period (discontinued vs indefinite duration). Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible. We excluded studies that included patients with cancer with VTE.

To evaluate the effect of duration of the primary treatment for unprovoked VTE, VTE provoked by chronic risk factors, and VTE provoked by transient risk factors, we included studies that compared shorter duration (3–6 months) with longer duration (> 6 months) anticoagulant treatment after the initial management phase. Studies were also eligible if they included patients who had completed treatment with anticoagulants for 3 to 6 months (ie, everyone completed the short duration) and who were then randomized to receive either a placebo or to continue additional treatment. Studies were included if the outcomes were assessed in both groups at the end of the follow-up period rather than at the end of treatment. We only included RCTs that measured the outcomes of both groups 3 months or longer after the end of longer anticoagulation treatment.

To evaluate whether to continue secondary prevention indefinitely for unprovoked VTE and VTE provoked by chronic risk factors, we included studies that compared discontinuing treatment after 3 to 12 months with treatment for indefinite duration that lasted longer than 12 months. Studies were included if the outcomes were assessed in both groups immediately at the end of the longer duration of antithrombotic therapy.

The following outcomes were prioritized as critical for clinical decision-making by the ASH guideline panel: all-cause mortality; nonfatal PE, which was considered present if documented objectively; DVT or recurrent DVT, which was considered present if documented objectively (either a venous segment of thrombus on ultrasonography or a new intraluminal filling defect on contrast venography); and major bleeding during the treatment or follow-up period after the initial DVT or PE diagnosis, defined using the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis criteria.

### Risk of venous thromboembolic events after surgery for cancer [^112fNr9x]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Major surgery and cancer are both risk factors for venous thromboembolism, causing considerable mortality and morbidity. Studies suggest that around 2% of patients who undergo cancer surgery develop clinically significant venous thromboembolism, accounting for around 50% of the early postoperative mortality.

To lower the risk of venous thromboembolic events, prophylactic administration of low molecular-weight heparin and other anticoagulants is clinical routine for many surgical procedures. However, the timing, duration, dosage, and choice of prophylaxis is based on limited data.

In many clinical guidelines, extended prophylaxis of 28 days, is recommended for patients undergoing cancer surgery. However, such recommendations are not based on precise estimates of disease-specific excess risk of thromboembolic events. Estimation of disease-specific risk is difficult and requires large surgical cohorts, and comparison populations are rarely available. We used nationwide and population-based health care and population databases to provide estimates of the risk of venous thromboembolic events and their temporal patterns among patients undergoing major surgery for different cancers.

### Antithrombotic therapy for venous thromboembolic disease: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^116ceJ2x]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This chapter about treatment for venous thromboembolic disease is part of the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do or do not outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patient values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading, see "Grades of Recommendation" chapter). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: for patients with objectively confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), we recommend anticoagulant therapy with subcutaneous (SC) low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), monitored IV, or SC unfractionated heparin (UFH), unmonitored weight-based SC UFH, or SC fondaparinux (all Grade 1A). For patients with a high clinical suspicion of DVT or PE, we recommend treatment with anticoagulants while awaiting the outcome of diagnostic tests (Grade 1C). For patients with confirmed PE, we recommend early evaluation of the risks to benefits of thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1C); for those with hemodynamic compromise, we recommend short-course thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1B); and for those with nonmassive PE, we recommend against the use of thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1B). In acute DVT or PE, we recommend initial treatment with LMWH, UFH or fondaparinux for at least 5 days rather than a shorter period (Grade 1C); and initiation of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) together with LMWH, UFH, or fondaparinux on the first treatment day, and discontinuation of these heparin preparations when the international normalized ratio (INR) is ≥ 2.0 for at least 24 h (Grade 1A). For patients with DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, we recommend treatment with a VKA for 3 months over treatment for shorter periods (Grade 1A). For patients with unprovoked DVT or PE, we recommend treatment with a VKA for at least 3 months (Grade 1A), and that all patients are then evaluated for the risks to benefits of indefinite therapy (Grade 1C). We recommend indefinite anticoagulant therapy for patients with a first unprovoked proximal DVT or PE and a low risk of bleeding when this is consistent with the patient's preference (Grade 1A), and for most patients with a second unprovoked DVT (Grade 1A). We recommend that the dose of VKA be adjusted to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations (Grade 1A). We recommend at least 3 months of treatment with LMWH for patients with VTE and cancer (Grade 1A), followed by treatment with LMWH or VKA as long as the cancer is active (Grade 1C). For prevention of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) after proximal DVT, we recommend use of an elastic compression stocking (Grade 1A). For DVT of the upper extremity, we recommend similar treatment as for DVT of the leg (Grade 1C). Selected patients with lower-extremity (Grade 2B) and upper-extremity (Grade 2C). DVT may be considered for thrombus removal, generally using catheter-based thrombolytic techniques. For extensive superficial vein thrombosis, we recommend treatment with prophylactic or intermediate doses of LMWH or intermediate doses of UFH for 4 weeks (Grade 1B).

Values and preferences

Please refer to the full recommendation reports below and the online evidence-to-decision (EtD) frameworks for considerations regarding values and preferences.

Explanations and other considerations

Please refer to the full recommendation reports below and the online EtD frameworks for explanations and other considerations.

Interpretation of strong and conditional recommendations

The strength of a recommendation is expressed as either strong ("the guideline panel recommends".) or conditional ("the guideline panel suggests… ") and has the following interpretation:

Strong recommendation

- **For patients**: most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not.
- **For clinicians**: most individuals should follow the recommended course of action; formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individual patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences.
- **For policymakers**: the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations; adherence to this recommendation according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator.
- **For researchers**: the recommendation is supported by credible research or other convincing judgments that make additional research unlikely to alter the recommendation. On occasion, a strong recommendation is based on low or very low certainty in the evidence. In such instances, further research may provide important information that alters the recommendations.

Conditional recommendation

- **For patients**: the majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not. Decision aids may be useful in helping patients to make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences.
- **For clinicians**: recognize that different choices will be appropriate for individual patients and that the clinician must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with their values and preferences. Decision aids may be useful in helping individuals to make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences.
- **For policymakers**: policy-making will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders. Performance measures about the suggested course of action should focus on whether an appropriate decision-making process is duly documented.
- **For researchers**: this recommendation is likely to be strengthened (for future updates or adaptation) by additional research. An evaluation of the conditions and criteria (and the related judgments, research evidence, and additional considerations) that determined the conditional (rather than strong) recommendation will help identify possible research gaps.

### Prevention of venous thromboembolism: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^111WxCnk]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This article discusses the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and is part of the Seventh American College of Chest Physicians Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence-Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following. We recommend against the use of aspirin alone as thromboprophylaxis for any patient group (Grade 1A). For moderate-risk general surgery patients, we recommend prophylaxis with low-dose unfractionated heparin (LDUH) (5,000 U bid) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) [≤ 3,400 U once daily] (both Grade 1A). For higher risk general surgery patients, we recommend thromboprophylaxis with LDUH (5,000 U tid) or LMWH (> 3,400 U daily) [both Grade 1A]. For high-risk general surgery patients with multiple risk factors, we recommend combining pharmacologic methods (LDUH three times daily or LMWH, > 3,400 U daily) with the use of graduated compression stockings and/or intermittent pneumatic compression devices (Grade 1C+). We recommend that thromboprophylaxis be used in all patients undergoing major gynecologic surgery (Grade 1A) or major, open urologic procedures, and we recommend prophylaxis with LDUH two times or three times daily (Grade 1A). For patients undergoing elective total hip or knee arthroplasty, we recommend one of the following three anticoagulant agents: LMWH, fondaparinux, or adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist (VKA) [international normalized ratio (INR) target, 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0] (all Grade 1A). For patients undergoing hip fracture surgery (HFS), we recommend the routine use of fondaparinux (Grade 1A), LMWH (Grade 1C+), VKA (target INR, 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0) [Grade 2B], or LDUH (Grade 1B). We recommend that patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty, or HFS receive thromboprophylaxis for at least 10 days (Grade 1A). We recommend that all trauma patients with at least one risk factor for VTE receive thromboprophylaxis (Grade 1A). In acutely ill medical patients who have been admitted to the hospital with congestive heart failure or severe respiratory disease, or who are confined to bed and have one or more additional risk factors, we recommend prophylaxis with LDUH (Grade 1A) or LMWH (Grade 1A). We recommend, on admission to the intensive care unit, all patients be assessed for their risk of VTE. Accordingly, most patients should receive thromboprophylaxis (Grade 1A).

### American Society of Hematology 2021 guidelines on the use of anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19 [^116RFHzg]. Blood Advances (2021). High credibility.

Anticoagulation for patients with COVID-19–related acute illness — panel considerations emphasize individualized use. The panel noted that "an individualized decision is important for each patient based on an assessment of thrombosis and bleeding risk". For escalation beyond standard dosing, the guidance states, "For certain patients with additional thrombotic risk factors or low bleeding risk, a higher-intensity anticoagulation could be considered". Practical adjustments are also addressed: "Dose adjustment of prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation for extremes of body weight or renal impairment may also be considered".

### Methodology for the development of antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis guidelines: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^114idBQG]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Background

To develop the Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: ACCP Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (AT9), the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) assembled a panel of clinical experts, information scientists, decision scientists, and systematic review and guideline methodologists.

Methods

Clinical areas were designated as articles, and a methodologist without important intellectual or financial conflicts of interest led a panel for each article. Only panel members without significant conflicts of interest participated in making recommendations. Panelists specified the population, intervention and alternative, and outcomes for each clinical question and defined criteria for eligible studies. Panelists and an independent evidence-based practice center executed systematic searches for relevant studies and evaluated the evidence, and where resources and evidence permitted, they created standardized tables that present the quality of the evidence and key results in a transparent fashion.

Results

One or more recommendations relate to each specific clinical question, and each recommendation is clearly linked to the underlying body of evidence. Judgments regarding the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were based on approaches developed by the Grades of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Working Group. Panel members constructed scenarios describing relevant health states and rated the disutility associated with these states based on an additional systematic review of evidence regarding patient values and preferences for antithrombotic therapy. These ratings guided value and preference decisions underlying the recommendations. Each topic panel identified questions in which resource allocation issues were particularly important and, for these issues, experts in economic analysis provided additional searches and guidance.

Conclusions

AT9 methodology reflects the current science of evidence-based clinical practice guideline development, with reliance on high-quality systematic reviews, a standardized process for quality assessment of individual studies and the body of evidence, an explicit process for translating the evidence into recommendations, disclosure of financial as well as intellectual conflicts of interest followed by management of disclosed conflicts, and extensive peer review.

### Executive summary: antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: second update of the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116fmMsi]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the 2nd update to the 9th edition of these guidelines. We provide recommendations on 17 PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) questions, four of which have not been addressed previously.

Methods

We generate strong and weak recommendations based on high-, moderate-, and low-certainty evidence, using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) methodology.

Results

The panel generated 29 guidance statements, 13 of which are graded as strong recommendations, covering aspects of antithrombotic management of VTE from initial management through secondary prevention and risk reduction of postthrombotic syndrome. Four new guidance statements have been added that did not appear in the 9th edition (2012) or 1st update (2016). Eight statements have been substantially modified from the 1st update.

Conclusion

New evidence has emerged since 2016 that further informs the standard of care for patients with VTE. Substantial uncertainty remains regarding important management questions, particularly in limited disease and special patient populations.

### Methodology for the development of antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis guidelines: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^112M3uzQ]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

American College of Chest Physicians antithrombotic guideline methodology — AT9 describes an explicit, transparent process using PICO-formulated questions, predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, exhaustive literature search, risk of bias evaluation, and a rigorous, standardized assessment of the evidence translated into recommendations using GRADE Working Group methodologies; values and preferences and resource considerations were incorporated, and bias from conflicts of interest was addressed through disclosure requirements and aggressive management. Limitations include that some authors were unable to produce Evidence Profiles and Summary of Findings tables, some recommendations would have benefited from meta-analyses, and although panelists were instructed to estimate patient values and preferences rather than their own, "we cannot be assured that they succeeded in all instances". Plans for updating include continuing to update recommendations when important new studies are published and adopting a "living guidelines" process whereby evidence-based guidelines will be periodically assessed and updated; ACCP will continue clinical resources such as quick reference materials, patient education materials, and slide sets, accessed online via the ACCP Web site with related tools and links.

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112yR2c1]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) on anticoagulant therapy — management principles: The guideline notes "There are no randomized trials or prospective cohort studies that have evaluated management of patients with recurrent VTE on anticoagulant therapy", so management "is based on low-quality evidence" and the likely cause, grouped into "(1) treatment factors and (2) the patient's intrinsic risk of recurrence". The risk "decreases rapidly after starting anticoagulant therapy, with a much higher risk during the first week (or month) compared with the second week (or month)", and an early recurrence "can generally be managed by a time-limited (eg, 1 month) period of more aggressive anticoagulant intensity (eg, switching from an oral agent back to LMWH, an increase in LMWH dose)". Treatment-factor checks include "(1) was LMWH being used; (2) was the patient adherent; (3) was VKA subtherapeutic; (4) was anticoagulant therapy prescribed correctly; (5) was the patient taking an NOAC and a drug that reduced anticoagulant effect; and (6) had anticoagulant dose been reduced (drugs other than VKA)?" For cancer-associated VTE and for unexplained recurrence on VKA or a NOAC, the panel states "There is moderate-quality evidence that LMWH is more effective than VKA therapy in patients with VTE and cancer", and provides dose-adjustment approaches: if LMWH was previously reduced "(eg, by 25% after 1 month of treatment), it is usually increased to the previous level", if on full-dose LMWH "the dose may be increased by about 25%", and "Once-daily LMWH may also be switched to a twice-daily regimen".

Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis (ACCP 9th ed) — heparin and VKA initiation overlap: Historically, clinicians administered IV unfractionated heparin (UFH) to inpatients for 5 to 7 days with subsequent initiation of a VKA, leading to a total duration of IV UFH of 10 to 14 days. More recently, VKA therapy has been initiated on the first or second day of heparin therapy, leading to shorter durations of heparin and earlier discharge from the hospital. Table 3 summarizes evidence from a meta-analysis of 807 patients.

### Dabigatran in the treatment and secondary prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in children with thrombophilia [^112RaoCM]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation is the standard treatment for VTE. The exact duration for optimal anticoagulation therapy has yet to be established in children with acute VTE. Recent evidence-based recommendations suggest longer duration for unprovoked thromboembolic events (6–12 months), regardless of inherited thrombophilia markers, than provoked events (3 months). Continuation of treatment is dependent on the benefits of maintaining a reduced risk of VTE recurrence vs the risk of bleeding.

Standard of care (SOC) anticoagulation is typically low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in pediatric patients with symptomatic VTE. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have shown superiority or noninferiority to SOC in lowering the prospect of thromboembolic complications, with comparable or diminished bleeding risk, and, therefore, current adult-based recommendations favor their use in the treatment of patients with proximal DVT and nonmassive PE, except for patients with antiphospholipid syndrome. Currently, there is no preferred anticoagulation agent recommended for long-term use, particularly in thrombophilia subgroups; however, use of DOACs might be advantageous because of the requirement for less clinical monitoring and follow-up than SOC treatments, and also, fewer food and drug interactions. The potential benefits of DOAC use, including stability and lower residual thrombus burden, along with a lower bleeding risk, have yet to be fully investigated in children with unprovoked VTE.

### Apixaban (Eliquis) [^114kr3Ug]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Dose in Adult Patients

Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation

The recommended dose of ELIQUIS for most patients is 5 mg taken orally twice daily.

The recommended dose of ELIQUIS is 2.5 mg twice daily in patients with at least two of the following characteristics:

age greater than or equal to 80 years
body weight less than or equal to 60 kg
serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL

Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis Following Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery

The recommended dose of ELIQUIS is 2.5 mg taken orally twice daily. The initial dose should be taken 12 to 24 hours after surgery.

In patients undergoing hip replacement surgery, the recommended duration of treatment is 35 days.
In patients undergoing knee replacement surgery, the recommended duration of treatment is 12 days.

Treatment of DVT and PE

The recommended dose of ELIQUIS is 10 mg taken orally twice daily for the first 7 days of therapy. After 7 days, the recommended dose is 5 mg taken orally twice daily.

Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of DVT and PE

The recommended dose of ELIQUIS is 2.5 mg taken orally twice daily after at least 6 months of treatment for DVT or PE [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

2.2 Recommended Dose in Pediatric Patients

Treatment of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) and Reduction in the Risk of Recurrent VTE in Pediatric Patients

The recommended dose of ELIQUIS is based on the patient's weight, see Table 1. Adjust the dose according to weight-tier as treatment progresses. Initiate ELIQUIS treatment for pediatric patients from birth to less than 18 years of age following at least 5 days of initial anticoagulation therapy. Individualize duration of overall therapy after careful assessment of the treatment benefit and the risk for bleeding.

Table 1: Dose Recommendation in Pediatric Patients from Birth to less than 18 Years of Age for the Treatment of VTE and Reduction in the Risk of Recurrent VTE

ELIQUIS is not recommended for use in pediatric patients less than 2.6 kg because ELIQUIS was not studied in these patients.

2.3 Missed Dose

If a dose of ELIQUIS is not taken at the scheduled time, the dose should be taken as soon as possible on the same day and twice-daily administration should be resumed. The dose should not be doubled to make up for a missed dose.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^111AJDBj]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Patient values and preferences in decision making for antithrombotic therapy — a systematic review summarizes included study types and key findings. We included studies examining patient preferences for alternative approaches to antithrombotic prophylaxis and studies that examined, in the context of antithrombotic prophylaxis or treatment, how patients value alternative health states and experiences with treatment. The review identified 48 eligible studies, with distribution: Sixteen dealt with atrial fibrillation, five with VTE, four with stroke or myocardial infarction prophylaxis, six with thrombolysis in acute stroke or myocardial infarction, and 17 with burden of antithrombotic treatment. Patient values and preferences regarding thromboprophylaxis treatment appear to be highly variable, and participant responses may depend on their prior experience with the treatments or health outcomes considered as well as on the methods used for preference elicitation. It should be standard for clinical practice guidelines to conduct systematic reviews of patient values and preferences in the specific content area.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in hospitalized heart failure — Class 1, Level B-R recommendation with dosing options and risk duration. In patients hospitalized with HF, prophylaxis for VTE is recommended to prevent venous thromboembolic disease. Trials and observational data note that this risk may extend for up to 2 years after hospitalization but is greatest in the first 30 days. For patients admitted specifically for decompensated HF and with adequate renal function (creatinine clearance, > 30 mL/min), randomized trials suggest that enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously once daily, unfractionated heparin 5000 units subcutaneously every 8 or 12 hours, or rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily will radiographically reduce demonstrable venous thrombosis; effects on mortality or clinically significant pulmonary embolism are unclear. For obese patients, a higher dose of enoxaparin 60 mg once daily achieved target range of thromboprophylaxis without increased bleeding.

Low- and middle-income country cost-effectiveness thresholds — Although certain interventions may be cost-effective in high-income countries (eg, < $20,000 per QALY gained), in poor countries, $20,000 gained per QALY may be prohibitive. Interventions that cost < 1 times the average per-capita income for a given country or region per QALY gained are considered very cost-effective; interventions that cost up to three times the average per-capita income per QALY gain are still considered cost-effective, whereas those that exceed this level are not considered to be cost-effective, and thresholds are defined in terms of GDP per capita.

American Society of Hematology (ASH) COVID-19 thromboprophylaxis — acute illness: The ASH guideline panel suggests using prophylactic-intensity over intermediate-intensity or therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation for patients with COVID-19–related acute illness who do not have suspected or confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE) (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects). Between online publication and print, a press release reported interim results from randomized trials in which therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation was compared with prophylactic-intensity in moderately ill hospitalized patients with COVID-19; the panel plans to update this recommendation when full results become available, and clinicians should weigh the potential benefits and harms based on the most up-to-date evidence. Patients with COVID-19–related acute illness are defined as those with clinical features warranting admission to an inpatient medical ward without requirement for advanced clinical support, with examples including dyspnea or mild to moderate hypoxia. An individualized assessment of thrombosis and bleeding risk is important; models exist but have not been validated for COVID-19, and higher-intensity anticoagulation may be preferred for patients judged to be at high thrombotic risk and low bleeding risk. There is no direct high-certainty evidence comparing different anticoagulant agents; selection may be based on availability, resources, familiarity, minimization of personal protective equipment exposure, and patient-specific factors including renal function, history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and gastrointestinal absorption concerns.

Patients with COVID-19–related critical illness are defined as those suffering from an immediately life-threatening condition who would typically be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), with examples including patients requiring hemodynamic support, ventilatory support, and renal-replacement therapy. Clinicians should weigh the potential benefits and harms based on the most up-to-date available evidence in caring for their patients, and the panel plans to update this recommendation when full trial results become available. An individualized assessment of thrombosis and bleeding risk is important; higher-intensity anticoagulation may be preferred for patients judged to be at high thrombotic risk and low bleeding risk. There is no direct high-certainty evidence comparing different anticoagulant agents, and selection may be based on availability, resources, familiarity, minimization of personal protective equipment exposure, and patient-specific factors such as renal function, history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and concerns about gastrointestinal tract absorption.

Neurosurgical procedures — VTE prophylaxis across guidelines emphasizes mechanical methods, with selective consideration of pharmacological options. For patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures, there are a total of 6 guidelines that offer somewhat conflicting recommendations on pharmacological VTE prophylaxis, but overall, mechanical prophylaxis is recommended for most neurosurgical patients. The benefit of pharmacological prophylaxis should be considered for patients at high risk or very high risk for VTE, but the overall risk/benefit profile is questionable, and in these circumstances mechanical prophylaxis is generally used. Guideline differences include that LMWH be used over UFH, whereas the 2012 ACCP guidelines do not give preference to any specific drug.

Other high-risk scenarios and when to hold VTE prophylaxis

How should VTE prophylaxis be managed with active bleeding or coagulopathy?

Recommendation

Pharmacological prophylaxis should be delayed in patients with active bleeding or coagulopathy, until these conditions have been controlled or reversed. Mechanical prophylaxis should be employed in these patients.

Discussion

It is appropriate to withhold chemical prophylaxis in patients with active bleeding or coagulopathy, or hemodynamic instability resulting from those conditions. Delaying initiation of enoxaparin should be minimized to the shortest acceptable time period, since the early trauma-induced coagulopathy soon gives way to a hypercoagulable state. In the setting of trauma coagulopathy, enoxaparin may be considered after completing the initial resuscitation, even though laboratory parameters of coagulation have not yet normalized. As holding pharmacological prophylaxis is associated with an increased VTE rate, enoxaparin initiation is encouraged if there are no signs of bleeding and the hypocoagulable state is expected to resolve. Intermittent pneumatic compression as a means of mechanical prophylaxis is an important adjunct in conditions that prohibit chemical prophylaxis, especially in patients with moderate-to-high VTE risk.

Should pharmacological VTE prophylaxis dosing be adjusted during pregnancy?

Recommendation

Dosing of pharmacological VTE prophylaxis should be adjusted in pregnant trauma patients.

Discussion

Pregnant trauma patients are at increased risk of VTE. Increases in weight and creatinine clearance make dosing adjustments for enoxaparin necessary, namely higher and more frequent dosing regimens. At admission, a pregnant trauma patient should receive enoxaparin 30 mg two times per day, and if the patient weighs > 90 kg then 40 mg two times per day should be initiated. The dosing should then be titrated by antifactor Xa levels to target a range of 0.2–0.4 IU/mL.

### The role of low-molecular-weight heparins in the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism in cancer patients [^116dY4Ct]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Accumulating evidence suggests that low-molecular-weight heparins are the drug of choice for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer. For prophylaxis in the surgical setting, once-daily subcutaneous injections of low-molecular-weight heparin are as effective and safe as multiple doses of unfractionated heparin. Extending prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparins beyond hospitalization was recently found to reduce safely the risk of postoperative thrombosis after abdominal surgery for cancer. For the long-term treatment of deep vein thrombosis and in select patients with pulmonary embolism, recently completed clinical trials have shown that secondary prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin is feasible and more effective than oral anticoagulant therapy in preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism in cancer patients. There is also evidence that low-molecular-weight heparins are effective in cancer patients who develop recurrent thrombosis while on warfarin therapy. Lastly, the potential antineoplastic effects of low-molecular-weight heparins make these agents an attractive option in patients with cancer. Although the management of cancer patients with venous thromboembolism remains challenging, low-molecular-weight heparins have simplified and improved the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism in these high-risk patients.

Dosing regimen for anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized COVID-19 patients — evidence is observational and methodologically limited: there were no studies comparing specific prophylaxis regimens; one retrospective ICU study reported reduced mortality with prophylactic heparin doses (most were on 40–60 mg enoxaparin per day), but for all comers there was no mortality difference related to heparin prophylaxis. In a single-center cohort of 2,773 patients, of whom 786 (28%) received therapeutic anticoagulation, in-hospital mortality was similar between anticoagulated and non-anticoagulated patients (22.5% vs 22.8%), while among mechanically ventilated patients mortality was lower with anticoagulation (29%, median survival of 21 days) than without (63%, median survival of 9 days). The risk of major bleeding was 3% vs 1.9% and the median duration of anticoagulation was 3 days; the guideline states this study should not inform patient management due to its limitations and notes that all identified studies are observational with select populations, making definitive interpretation difficult.

AT9 resource use methodology — economic evaluation was restricted to recommendations where resource use might change the direction or strength and where high-quality economic evaluations were available; otherwise resource use was not considered. Six clinicians with expertise in decision and economic analyses participated, and panelists, with resource use consultants, identified questions for which resource use could alter recommendation strength, sought high-quality economic analyses, and applied the evidence to the relevant recommendations. If net costs or marginal cost-effectiveness ratios were very high, panelists considered rating down the quality of evidence from high to low or possibly changing the direction of the recommendation using guides described in section 6.4. Literature searches were conducted by the Oregon Health & Science University Evidence-based Practice Center in Medline and the Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials, restricted to published studies from 1999 forward, encompassing publications from January 1999 forward with end dates ranging between November 2009 and March 2010. A standardized data extraction form ensured uniform evaluation, and quality assessment used published criteria including perspective, appropriateness of time horizon (preferably lifetime), high-quality evidence for probabilities and rates, high-quality cost sources, appropriate preference measurement methods, and deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.

NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) for Cancer-Associated Venous Thromboembolic Disease focus on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with cancer who have developed or who are at risk for developing venous thromboembolism (VTE). VTE is a significant concern among cancer patients, who are at heightened risks for developing as well as dying from the disease. The management of patients with cancer with VTE often requires multidisciplinary efforts at treating institutions. The NCCN panel comprises specialists from various fields: cardiology, hematology/hematologic oncology, internal medicine, interventional radiology, medical oncology, pharmacology/pharmacy, and surgery/surgical oncology. This article focuses on VTE prophylaxis for medical and surgical oncology inpatients and outpatients, and discusses risk factors for VTE development, risk assessment tools, as well as management methods, including pharmacological and mechanical prophylactics. Contraindications to therapeutic interventions and special dosing, when required, are also discussed.

### Patient values and preferences in decision making for antithrombotic therapy: a systematic review: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^1148CnJA]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Development of clinical practice guidelines involves making trade-offs between desirable and undesirable consequences of alternative management strategies. Although the relative value of health states to patients should provide the basis for these trade-offs, few guidelines have systematically summarized the relevant evidence. We conducted a systematic review relating to values and preferences of patients considering antithrombotic therapy.

Methods

We included studies examining patient preferences for alternative approaches to antithrombotic prophylaxis and studies that examined, in the context of antithrombotic prophylaxis or treatment, how patients value alternative health states and experiences with treatment. We conducted a systematic search and compiled structured summaries of the results. Steps in the process that involved judgment were conducted in duplicate.

Results

We identified 48 eligible studies. Sixteen dealt with atrial fibrillation, five with VTE, four with stroke or myocardial infarction prophylaxis, six with thrombolysis in acute stroke or myocardial infarction, and 17 with burden of antithrombotic treatment.

Conclusion

Patient values and preferences regarding thromboprophylaxis treatment appear to be highly variable. Participant responses may depend on their prior experience with the treatments or health outcomes considered as well as on the methods used for preference elicitation. It should be standard for clinical practice guidelines to conduct systematic reviews of patient values and preferences in the specific content area.

### Length of anticoagulation in provoked venous thromboembolism: a multicenter study of how real-world practice mirrors guideline recommendations [^116kMtrw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Anticoagulation is the cornerstone of venous thromboembolism (VTE) management, aimed at preventing thrombus propagation, embolization, and recurrence, but balanced against risk of bleeding. For patients with provoked VTE, referring to VTE after a transient trigger, the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines have recommended 3 months of anticoagulation since at least 2008. In patients with provoked VTE and without any other indication for anticoagulation, the ACCP recommends discontinuing anticoagulation at this 3‐month mark. Although these guidelines have been in place for over a decade, it is unclear if they are followed in real‐world practice.

In the past decade, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have shifted anticoagulation administration practices. The favorable safety and efficacy profiles of DOACs have raised the possibility of providing a longer duration of anticoagulation for VTE. The 2013 AMPLIFY‐EXT (Apixaban After the Initial Management of Pulmonary Embolism and Deep Vein Thrombosis With First‐Line Therapy‐Extended Treatment) study evaluated the use of apixaban, and the 2017 EINSTEIN CHOICE (Reduced‐Dosed Rivaroxaban in the Long‐Term Prevention of Recurrent Symptomatic Venous Thromboembolism) study evaluated the use of rivaroxaban for extended duration of anticoagulation in patients with provoked and unprovoked VTE. Both studies found a reduced risk of recurrent VTE in the group taking DOACs compared with the control group, without substantial increase in bleeding episodes. The low bleeding rates reported in studies of patients receiving anticoagulation beyond the 3‐ to 6‐month window may influence how clinicians think about the risk–benefit of anticoagulation at the 3‐month mark. Although fewer than 10% of patients in the AMPLIFY‐EXT had a provoked VTE, clinicians may apply the study findings to their patients with a provoked VTE, despite the updated ACCP guidelines released in August 2021 that continue to recommend only 3 months of anticoagulation for patients with provoked VTE, regardless of which anticoagulation agent is prescribed.

The primary aim of this study was to measure anticoagulation duration in an unselected, real‐world population of patients and compare current clinical practice to long‐standing guideline recommendations for patients with provoked VTE. The secondary aims were to compare duration of anticoagulation between patients taking warfarin and DOACs, and to identify variables that predict anticoagulant duration in patients with provoked VTE taking warfarin compared with DOACs.

### A comparison of international clinical practice guidelines for postpartum venous thromboembolism prophylaxis [^117RaKHn]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

The differences in the proportion of women qualifying for LMWH thromboprophylaxis between the clinical guidelines can be largely explained by the baseline risk each guideline uses to determine which women should be offered LMWH. The ACCP guideline uses a baseline risk > 3% for a woman developing venous thromboembolism as the level at which a woman would be recommended pharmacological thromboprophylaxis, whereas the SOGC uses a venous thromboembolic risk > 1% to guide the recommended use of LMWH. Although the SOMANZ and the RCOG guidelines do not specify a baseline risk at which LMWH is recommended, the relatively high proportion of women qualifying for LMWH when applying the SOMANZ and RCOG recommendations in this study suggests that the baseline risk used in both these guidelines is closer to that of the SOGC guideline, rather than that of the ACCP guideline.

Clinical practice guidelines base their recommendations for postpartum thromboprophylaxis upon patient risk factors, however the evidence on which to base indications for LMWH use and duration of therapy after birth is limited. Recommendations are based not on incontrovertible evidence, but largely on expert opinion, observational studies, and extrapolation from non-obstetric populations. Indeed, an acknowledgement of this very low-grade evidence can be found in each of the guidelines. Although caesarean birth is a common indication for postpartum LMWH, a recent Cochrane review comparing heparin thromboprophylaxis with no treatment/placebo, based on four trials and only 840 women, found no difference in symptomatic thromboembolic events. Similarly, the Cochrane review found heparin thromboprophylaxis following any type of birth (vaginal or caesarean) had no effect on thromboembolic disease when compared with no treatment. Women with a stillbirth in the current pregnancy have been identified as being at particularly high risk of having a venous thromboembolic event, with an approximately six-fold increased risk, which is even higher than that posed by caesarean birth during labour. Surprisingly, only two of the four guidelines (RCOG and SOGC) include stillbirth as a risk factor for thromboembolic disease. There is also a lack of consensus among the four guidelines around the use of LMWH following emergency caesarean section. Both the SOMANZ and RCOG guidelines recommend LMWH for emergency caesarean alone, whereas the SOGC and ACCP guidelines require another major risk factor (e.g. medical comorbidity) in conjunction with the emergency caesarean to qualify for LMWH.

The guideline issues a "conditional recommendation for LMWH over fondaparinux" for the first week of initial treatment and states "The use of fondaparinux might be considered for patients with cancer and VTE and a prior history of HIT".

Resource use issues (costs) in AT9 — economic evaluation was considered only when resource use could plausibly change the direction or strength of a recommendation and high-quality economic evaluations were available; when this was not the case, resource use was not considered. Six clinicians with expertise in decision and economic analyses participated. Panelists identified questions for which resource use might change recommendations, sought high-quality economic analyses, applied the evidence when available, and if "net costs or marginal cost-effectiveness ratios were very high", considered rating down the quality of evidence or changing the recommendation using guides described in section 6.4. Literature searches were conducted by the Oregon Health & Science University Evidence-based Practice Center in Medline and the Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials, supplemented by targeted searches; searches were "restricted to published studies from 1999 forward", encompassing "publications from January 1999 forward", with end dates "between November 2009 and March 2010". Evaluation used a standardized data extraction form, and quality assessment (based on published criteria) included perspective of analysis, appropriateness of time horizon (preferably lifetime), evidence for probabilities and rates, high-quality cost sources, appropriate preference measurement methods, and sensitivity analyses to explore uncertainty (both deterministic and probabilistic).

### Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in hospitalized medical patients and those with stroke: a background review for an American College of Physicians clinical practice guideline [^112Uw8g8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis has been recommended for nonsurgical patients, but its effectiveness remains uncertain.

Purpose

To assess the benefits and harms of prophylaxis in hospitalized adult medical patients and those with acute stroke.

Data Sources

MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library from 1950 through April 2011, reference lists, and study authors.

Study Selection

English-language randomized trials were included if they provided clinical outcomes and evaluated therapy with low-dose heparin or related agents or mechanical measures compared with placebo, no treatment, or other active prophylaxis in the target population.

Data Extraction

Two independent investigators extracted data on study characteristics and clinical outcomes up to 120 days after randomization. The primary outcome was total mortality.

Data Synthesis

In medical patients, heparin prophylaxis did not reduce total mortality but did result in fewer pulmonary embolisms (PEs) (odds ratio [OR], 0.69 [95% CI, 0.52 to 0.90], but with evidence of publication bias) and an increase in all bleeding events (risk ratio [RR], 1.34 [CI, 1.08 to 1.66]). Heparin prophylaxis had no statistically significant effect on any outcome in patients with acute stroke except for an increase in major bleeding events (OR, 1.66 [CI, 1.20 to 2.28]). When trials of medical patients and those with stroke were considered together (18 studies; 36,122 patients), heparin prophylaxis reduced the incidence of PE (OR, 0.70 [CI, 0.56 to 0.87]; absolute reduction, 3 events per 1000 patients treated [CI, 1 to 5 events]) but increased the incidence of all bleeding (RR, 1.28 [CI, 1.05 to 1.56]) and major bleeding events (OR, 1.61 [CI, 1.23 to 2.10]), with an absolute increase of 9 bleeding events per 1000 patients treated (CI, 2 to 18 events), 4 of which were major (CI, 1 to 7 events). A reduction in total mortality approached statistical significance (RR, 0.93 [CI, 0.86 to 1.00]; P = 0.056; absolute decrease, 6 deaths per 1000 patients treated [CI, 0 to 11 deaths]). No statistically significant differences in clinical outcomes were observed in the 14 trials that compared unfractionated heparin with low-molecular-weight heparin. No improvements in clinical outcomes were seen in the 3 studies of mechanical prophylaxis in patients with stroke, but more patients had lower-extremity skin damage (RR, 4.02 [CI, 2.34 to 6.91])-an increase of 39 events per 1000 patients treated (CI, 17 to 77 events).

Limitation

Non-English-language studies were not included, but these were few and small.

Conclusion

Heparin prophylaxis had no significant effect on mortality, may have reduced PE in medical patients and all patients combined, and led to more bleeding and major bleeding events, thus resulting in little or no net benefit. No differences in benefits or harms were found according to type of heparin used. Mechanical prophylaxis provided no benefit and resulted in clinically important harm to patients with stroke.

Disclosing and managing conflicts of interest — All panelists were required to disclose both financial conflicts of interest, such as receipt of funds for consulting with industry, and intellectual conflicts of interest, such as publication of original data bearing directly on a recommendation. Financial and intellectual conflicts of interest were classified as primary (more serious) or secondary (less serious). Topic panel members, including the deputy editor, with primary conflicts related to a particular recommendation did not participate in the final deliberations that led to the decision regarding the direction or strength of a recommendation, nor did they vote on recommendations for which they were primarily conflicted; panelists with primary conflicts could, however, participate in discussions and offer their opinions on interpretations of the evidence. The ACCP HSP Committee deemed some of these conflicts serious enough to require "management". Management involved more frequent updates of disclosures than required of the approved panelists without any conflicts and recusal from activities relevant to that conflict.

Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) monitoring and anti-Xa targets — coagulation monitoring is not generally necessary, though some authorities suggest monitoring in obese patients and in those with renal insufficiency, and monitoring may also be advisable when treatment doses are given during pregnancy. A randomized controlled trial comparing monitored and unmonitored dalteparin therapy for treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) showed no benefit of monitoring; monitoring is thus not recommended for the majority of patients, and if monitoring is required, the anti-Xa level is the recommended test. For treatment of VTE, a conservative peak anti-Xa level with twice-daily enoxaparin or nadroparin is 0.6 to 1.0 units/mL, and the target range for peak anti-Xa levels measured 4 h after dosing with once-daily enoxaparin is likely to be above 1.0 units/mL, whereas it is 0.85 units/mL with tinzaparin and 1.3 units/mL and 1.05 units/mL with nadroparin and dalteparin, respectively.

### Low-molecular-weight heparin for thromboprophylaxis [^112jiF29]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Venous thromboembolism represents a potentially threatening complication in surgical and medical patients. Thromboprophylaxis showed a significant reduction of venous thromboembolic events, and low-molecular-weight heparins have been considered the standardized prophylactic regimen for a long time. The purpose of this review is to provide updated evidence on the use of low-molecular-weight heparins for prevention of venous thromboembolism after the publication of the latest American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy.

Recent Findings

Low-molecular-weight heparins, used as comparator or investigational drug, have been investigated in several studies not included in the analysis of the latest American College of Chest Physicians Guidelines on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy. Data gathered from studies published from December 2007 up to May 2009 dealing with surgical and medical patients have been collected and discussed.

Summary

Low-molecular-weight heparins are expanding their application, but progressively they will be replaced by other new antithrombotics for the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism. Surgical patients undergo a more concerted approach to thromboprophylaxis than medical patients. Future research should aim at improving prophylaxis in the latter setting in order to significantly reduce the rate of venous thromboembolic events.

### The impact of once-versus twice-daily enoxaparin prophylaxis on risk for venous thromboembolism and clinically relevant bleeding [^111qdq3s]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism is a life- or limb-threatening complication that occurs in plastic surgery patients. At present, the optimal dose of enoxaparin that balances the risk of venous thromboembolism and the risk of medication-related adverse drug events-specifically, bleeding-remains unknown.

Methods

This study compared pharmacodynamic and clinical outcomes, including 90-day venous thromboembolism and 90-day clinically relevant bleeding, between two prospectively performed clinical trials whose sole difference was postoperative anticoagulation strategy. Patients in trial 1 received enoxaparin 40 mg once daily for the duration of inpatient stay, and patients in trial 2 received enoxaparin 40 mg twice daily for the duration of inpatient stay. The study also examined the potential impact of a weight-based twice-daily prophylaxis strategy to achieve in-range anti-factor Xa levels.

Results

The study compared 94 patients who received once-daily enoxaparin to 118 patients who received twice-daily enoxaparin. Twice-daily enoxaparin was associated with a significant decrease in 90-day acute venous thromboembolism (0 percent versus 5.3 percent; p = 0.012) and a nonsignificant increase in 90-day clinically relevant bleeding (6.8 percent versus 3.2 percent; p = 0.25). Twice-daily enoxaparin at 0.4 to 0.5 mg/kg may allow an increased proportion of patients to avoid both inadequate anticoagulation and overanticoagulation, based on anti-factor Xa levels.

Conclusions

Twice-daily enoxaparin is superior to once-daily enoxaparin for 90-day acute venous thromboembolism risk reduction. Twice-daily enoxaparin may increase clinically relevant bleeding, although observed differences in this study were not significant. Weight-based twice-daily enoxaparin dosing may optimize the risks and benefits of prophylactic anticoagulation after plastic and reconstructive surgery.

### American Society of Hematology living guidelines on use of anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis for patients with COVID-19: executive summary [^115fNtcS]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 1a

The American Society of Hematology (ASH) guideline panel suggests using prophylactic-intensity over intermediate-intensity anticoagulation for patients with COVID-19–related critical illness who do not have suspected or confirmed VTE or another indication for anticoagulation (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁○○○).

Recommendation 1b

The ASH guideline panel suggests using prophylactic-intensity over therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation for patients with COVID-19–related critical illness who do not have suspected or confirmed VTE or another indication for anticoagulation (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁○○○).

Remarks:

- Patients with COVID-19–related critical illness are defined as those suffering from an immediately life–threatening condition who would typically be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) because of COVID-19. Examples include patients requiring hemodynamic support, ventilatory support, and renal replacement therapy.
- An individualized assessment of the patient's risk of thrombosis and bleeding is important when deciding on anticoagulation intensity. Risk assessment models (RAMs) to estimate thrombotic risk have been validated in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (critically or noncritically ill), with modest prognostic performance. No RAMs for bleeding have been validated for patients with COVID-19. The panel acknowledges that higher-intensity anticoagulation may be preferred for patients judged to be at low bleeding risk and high thrombotic risk.
- At present, there is no direct high-certainty evidence comparing different types of anticoagulants. The selection of a specific agent (eg, low molecular weight heparin [LMWH] and unfractionated heparin [UFH]) may be based on availability, resources required, familiarity, the aim of minimizing the use of personal protective equipment or exposure to staff to patients with COVID-19, as well as patient-specific factors (eg, renal function, history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and bleeding risk). LMWH and UFH were used in the identified studies and may be preferred because of a preponderance of evidence with these agents. There are no studies of intermediate- or therapeutic-intensity fondaparinux, argatroban, or bivalirudin in this population.
- These recommendations do not apply to patients who require anticoagulation to prevent thrombosis of extracorporeal circuits such as those on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).

Reevaluation of evidence — patient-important vs surrogate outcomes: Applying the ACCP-GRADE approach requires distinguishing patient-important from surrogate outcomes; for example, an intervention that increases serious bleeding by 20 events in 1,000 patients but reduces asymptomatic thrombosis by 100 in 1,000 leaves net benefit unclear without knowing the symptomatic DVT and pulmonary embolism reductions. The authors highlight the need for studies that directly measure symptomatic thrombosis without venographic or ultrasound surveillance.

### Laboratory tests and the new oral anticoagulants [^116E9s2Y]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

New oral anticoagulants are ready to enter the scene on a massive basis for the treatment/prophylaxis of many cardiovascular diseases. Although they can be prescribed without dose-adjustment based on laboratory testing, the laboratory is still an essential partner that may assist clinicians for the management of anticoagulated patients. In principle, there are many tests that can be used to evaluate the anticoagulant effect of the new drugs, but the choice should be made among those that are more readily available in emergency and that are easy to run. Linearity of dose-response and responsiveness to increasing dose in addition to standardization are other important issues to consider. This article is aimed at reviewing the current tests, their characteristics and the most appropriate choice.

### Should we follow the 9th ACCP guidelines for VTE prevention in surgical patients? [^113TFG1f]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

The 9th edition of the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines on antithrombotic therapy and prevention, includes relevant changes compared to previous versions. In the 9th ACCP, leadership of most chapters was given to methodologists who were familiar with the GRADE methodology. All topic panelists underwent a selection process paying particular attention to their financial and intellectual conflicts of interests. In the 9th ACCP guidelines, evidence has been explicitly presented in many evidence profiles and summary of evidence tables. In order to get a more balanced trade-off between desirable and undesirable effects of the alternative prevention and therapeutic interventions, there has been an increased emphasis on clinically relevant events, as opposed to previous surrogate asymptomatic outcomes. In addition, there has been a systematic review and survey on patient values and preferences for thrombotic and bleeding outcomes. As a result of the above changes, the strength of most recommendations has been downgraded compared to previous editions. The main changes regarding prevention on nonorthopedic surgical patients include the adoption of two risk assessment models. The only recommendation that has been upgraded is to extend prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) for four weeks after abdominal or pelvic cancer surgery. A controversial modification in orthopedic patients is recommendation in favor of the use of aspirin after hip or knee arthroplasty. New oral anticoagulants are recommended, but LMWH are suggested as the preferred option. Extending pharmacological prophylaxis for up to 35days rather than 10–14days is now suggested for patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery.

### Management of venous thromboembolism: recent advances in oral anticoagulation therapy [^115X5uii]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical Considerations in Incorporating DOACs in the Management of VTE

Recently published antithrombotic guidelines support the use of DOAC agents over VKA therapy (Grade 2B recommendation) in patients with DVT or PE without cancer. Despite the significant advance that DOACs represent, they are not without risk, and thus, clinicians need to consider a number of clinical issues to optimize treatment. Assessment of the following factors may be helpful in selecting one DOAC over another or, alternatively, oral anticoagulation with a VKA.

Pharmacokinetic and Dosing Considerations

The pharmacokinetic characteristics of DOACs have been well described. Because the DOACs have predictable and stable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, unlike VKAs, routine monitoring of anticoagulant activity is not required. However, it is important to note that in clinical scenarios where the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic response may be altered significantly (eg, organ dysfunction or drug-drug interactions), there currently is no readily available coagulation assay approved in the United States that can precisely assess the level of anticoagulation for any of the DOACs. For information on currently available coagulation assays to measure the level of anticoagulation with DOACs, the reader is referred to several recent reviews. Despite this gap, the great majority of patients can be appropriately managed with standard fixed doses for each DOAC, which greatly simplifies many aspects of patient management compared with VKAs. The potential for dosing errors with DOACs is still present, however. The 4 agents have achieved regulatory approval in the United States for the treatment of acute or chronic VTE, each with a different dosing scheme that may differ by indication, adding some complexity for the clinician when selecting the appropriate dose. Table 1 highlights the approved dosing regimens per indication for the DOACs available in the United States.

Depending on the health care setting, clinicians may routinely interact with patients on different DOACs, and care must be taken to ensure appropriateness of the chosen therapy and initial dose. In addition, transition from injectable agent to oral DOAC (dabigatran, edoxaban) or from oral high dose to oral maintenance dose (rivaroxaban at 21 days, apixaban at 7 days) should be implemented at the appropriate juncture. Particularly at times of transitions of care (ie, bridging), the practitioner may be faced with multiple decisions regarding switching agents or alternative anticoagulation. Data to support best practice in switching from VKA to a DOAC or vice versa are, however, limited, although the phase 3 DOAC trials in VTE and atrial fibrillation (AF) as well as best practice reports provide some information.-

### Subcutaneous enoxaparin in the treatment of DVT… [^113azBAF]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Deep venous thrombosis is often treated in the hospital with five to 10 days of unfractionated heparin. The activated partial thromboplastin time is maintained at more than 1. 5 times its control value. An alternative initial treatment is five to 10 days of weight-adjusted low-molecular-weight heparin. Both initial regimens are followed by at least three months of oral anticoagulant therapy. Studies supporting the use of low-molecular-weight heparin to treat DVT have been small and often have excluded patients with pulmonary embolism. Because of this, Merli and associates compared the use of continuously infused unfractionated heparin with two weight-adjusted dosages of enoxaparin, administered subcutaneously once or twice daily. The primary clinical end point was recurrent DVT or pulmonary embolism within three months of randomization. Of the 740 evaluable patients who completed the protocol, 694 initially presented with proximal lower-extremity DVT.

A total of 287 patients also had documented pulmonary embolism at presentation. Venous thromboembolism recurrence within the three-month follow-up period was similar among all three treatment groups. Cancer and symptomatic pulmonary embolism were significant risk factors for recurrence, regardless of treatment. Obesity was also a risk factor for recurrence in the patients treated with enoxaparin. There was little difference in adverse events or deaths among the three treatment groups. The incidence of thrombocytopenia was similar in all groups. The authors conclude that enoxaparin administered subcutaneously once or twice daily was as effective and safe as unfractionated heparin in preventing recurrence of venous thromboembolic disease. Patients with cancer and symptomatic pulmonary embolism were more likely to develop recurrence of venous thromboembolism regardless of treatment group.

The authors concluded that low-molecular-weight heparin was no less effective and probably more effective than dose-adjusted intravenous unfractionated heparin in preventing recurrent DVT in patients with pulmonary embolism and associated proximal DVT. Other studies demonstrate the feasibility of treating patients with self-injection at home under the supervision of hospital-based nurses. Home treatment is becoming more accepted, except in patients with massive pulmonary embolism, those at high risk for major bleeding or an active bleed, and patients who are hospitalized for other reasons that prevent discharge. — r. s.

### Anti-factor Xa trough level-adjusted enoxaparin and venous thromboembolism… [^114Q5nSu]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Options for thromboprophylaxis in trauma patients include mechanical prophylaxis and chemoprophylaxis. sodium, 30 mg twice daily, are the acceptable standard for DVT prophylaxis. 7, 8 However, there may be decreased bioavailability of enoxaparin in critically ill trauma patients9, 10; consequently, standard prophylactic doses may not be sufficient to achieve optimal therapeutic anti–factor Xa trough goals of 0. 1 to
0. 2 IU/mL in this population. 11, 12 The risk of VTE when enoxaparin is dosed by anti-Xa trough level is not well described. Although enoxaparin sodium, 30 mg twice daily, is considered standard for VTE prophylaxis, 7, 8 this may be insufficient in preventing thromboembolic events in critically ill patients as there may be decreased enoxaparin bioavailability in this population. 9–12, 14 Consistent with the literature, our study found that 83. 9% of trauma patients had subprophylactic anti-Xa trough levels at enoxaparin sodium dosages of 30 mg twice daily.

Ideal enoxaparin dosing and monitoring for thromboprophylaxis have been debatable. Enoxaparin sodium dosing in obese trauma patients is possible by weight-based administration at 0. 5 mg/kg twice daily with subsequent dosage adjustments aimed at a prophylactic peak range of
0. 2 to 0. 6 IU/mL. 16 Nunez et al10 conducted a prospective study comparing weight-based enoxaparin sodium dosages at 0. 6 mg/kg twice daily in 37 critically ill trauma patients, with a historical cohort receiving standard prophylactic enoxaparin. In our study, patients undergoing dosage adjustment based on trough goals demonstrated no significant difference in PRBC transfusion rate or predischarge hematocrit compared with patients receiving the standard enoxaparin sodium dosage of 30 mg twice daily. This suggests that our protocol of dosing enoxaparin does not increase the risk of bleeding-related complications and is safe in trauma patients.

We therefore suggest that trauma patients may initially begin treatment with enoxaparin sodium at a dosage of 40 mg twice daily, but we advocate subsequent dosing based on trough goals. Similar trough-based protocols for dosing enoxaparin may be beneficial in other critically ill or high-risk patients with less predictable trough levels and would be an opportunity for further study.

### Safety and efficacy of apixaban vs enoxaparin for… [^113PzBHZ]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Question Is there an efficacious and safe oral treatment for thromboprophylaxis in postoperative patients with suspected gynecologic malignant neoplasms. Findings. Meaning These findings suggest that oral apixaban may offer a safe alternative to subcutaneous enoxaparin that is easier and less painful for patients to take. Importance Current guidelines recommend a 28-day course of enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis after surgery for gynecologic cancer. The high cost of this medication and the low adherence rates observed in prior studies provide an opportunity to benefit patients by demonstrating the safety of a more cost-effective, easier to use thromboprophylactic. Interventions Women were randomized to 28 days of apixaban or enoxaparin. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was major bleeding and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding events.

Secondary outcomes included incidence of venous thromboembolic events, adverse events, medication adherence, participant quality of life, and medication satisfaction. Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that oral apixaban is a potentially safe, less painful, and easier-to-take alternative to subcutaneous enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis after surgery for gynecologic cancer. The efficacy of apixaban to prevent venous thromboembolic events is hypothesized as being equivalent. The American Society of Clinical Oncology has developed guidelines for postoperative VTE prophylaxis in oncology patients to reduce the health care burden of these complications. 10, 11 These have been further validated with the adoption of the CHEST 2016 guidelines12 and include the use of preoperative heparin, sequential compression devices during surgery, and postsurgical DVT prophylaxis using heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin.

Current recommendations include 28 days of postoperative prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin.
13. These findings suggest that oral apixaban is a safe potential alternative to subcutaneous enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis in women undergoing surgery for gynecologic cancer. Satisfaction measures were markedly better in the apixaban group, and adherence rates were similar between both modalities in the controlled environment of this trial. Surgeons should continue to use appropriate postoperative VTE prophylaxis in high-risk surgical oncology patients to help prevent this potentially life-threatening outcome and may consider at their discretion the safety of thromboprophylaxis options.
