## Question

What to do when alkaline phosphatase is high

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to do when alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is high. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the abnormality and excluding transient causes. Then, I should verify the source of ALP using GGT and isoenzyme patterns. Next, I will consider age- and sex-specific physiology and common non-hepatic causes. After that, I will outline a hepatic workup if the source is hepatobiliary, including imaging and serologies. Finally, I will address non-hepatic etiologies, special populations, and monitoring or treatment strategies, making sure I double-check thresholds and guideline nuances throughout.

> Let me first confirm the abnormality and not jump to conclusions. I should repeat the liver panel and/or add a clarifying test like GGT to ensure the elevation is real and persistent, because transient elevations are common and repeating the panel can avoid unnecessary workups, and I need to check for recent intercurrent illness, strenuous exercise, or lab handling issues that could artifactually raise ALP [^a080bacb] [^abd53d51].

> Wait, let me verify the source of ALP before chasing disease. GGT is the most practical next test to confirm hepatobiliary origin; if GGT is normal, I should consider bone, intestinal, or placental sources, and if the pattern remains unclear, I can order ALP isoenzyme electrophoresis to distinguish liver, bone, and intestinal fractions, keeping in mind that GGT is not specific and can be elevated with alcohol, medications, or obesity, so I should interpret it in clinical context [^c1d63df8] [^584fd32f] [^b59e34c7].

> Hold on, I should verify age- and sex-specific physiology because reference ranges vary widely. In children and adolescents, ALP is normally higher due to growth, and in pregnancy, placental ALP elevates late gestation, so I need to compare to age- and sex-adjusted intervals to avoid misclassification, and I should remember that benign familial hyperphosphatasemia can cause modest intestinal ALP elevations in some families without disease [^c5c7173a] [^584fd32f] [^d69fc4a8].

> I will now examine non-hepatic causes if GGT is normal or the isoenzyme pattern suggests bone or intestine. Vitamin D deficiency, Paget's disease, bone metastases, and healing fractures can raise bone ALP, and in suspected Paget's, total ALP correlates with disease extent and guides therapy response; in CKD, bone-specific ALP helps assess bone turnover, and in oncology, marked ALP elevations can signal bone metastases and carry prognostic implications, so I should tailor imaging and markers accordingly [^ad5fe6fe] [^d8e8a83a] [^c72ce1c3] [^fb23043d].

> Next, I should review the hepatic workup if GGT is elevated or the isoenzyme pattern is hepatic. Right upper quadrant ultrasound is the first-line imaging to assess for extrahepatic obstruction versus intrahepatic cholestasis; if ducts are dilated, I should proceed to MRCP or ERCP, and if ducts are not dilated, I should evaluate for intrahepatic cholestatic diseases such as PBC and PSC with AMA and autoimmune serologies, recognizing that AMA has high specificity for PBC and that cholangiography is needed for PSC [^d6a25fc0] [^c1d63df8] [^bffc0f7b] [^b69668d8].

> But wait, what if the ALP is only modestly elevated and everything else is unrevealing. I should double-check for medication-induced cholestasis, infiltrative disease, or granulomatous hepatitis, and consider liver biopsy if ALP remains more than 1.5–2 times the upper limit of normal after 6 months of observation or if the clinical picture suggests overlapping autoimmune or small-duct disease, keeping in mind that persistent unexplained cholestasis warrants tissue diagnosis [^927019e1] [^a080bacb].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts so I don't miss important nuances. In pregnancy, I should confirm placental origin and consider that very high ALP has been linked to placental insufficiency and IUGR, prompting fetal surveillance when clinically indicated; in children, I should prioritize biliary atresia and other congenital cholestatic disorders if GGT is high, and use pediatric-specific pathways; in older adults, I should maintain a low threshold for bone disease and malignancy; in CKD, I should interpret ALP in the context of PTH and vitamin D status and consider bone-specific ALP when liver disease is possible [^e618422a] [^b59e34c7] [^d8e8a83a] [^c17d470b].

> I need to ensure I address treatment and monitoring once the etiology is identified. For PBC, ursodeoxycholic acid is first-line and I should reassess biochemistry at 6–12 months to guide second-line therapy; for PSC, there is no proven disease-modifying therapy, but ALP trends correlate with prognosis, so I should monitor and manage complications; for Paget's, bisphosphonates reduce ALP and relieve symptoms, and I should monitor total ALP to gauge response; for vitamin D deficiency, repletion typically normalizes ALP over weeks to months, and I should recheck calcium, phosphate, and ALP to confirm healing [^f4ff01d4] [^d974bc40] [^508b3144] [^3748f23b].

> Hold on, I should verify prognostic implications so counseling is accurate. Elevated ALP is associated with increased mortality in the general population and in CKD, and in cholestatic liver diseases, ALP and bilirubin dynamics track disease severity and transplant-free survival, so persistent or rising ALP deserves closer follow-up and risk stratification even when patients are asymptomatic [^adb67f47] [^6fdde178] [^f4ff01d4] [^d974bc40].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency. Confirm the abnormality, add GGT to localize the source, apply age- and sex-specific ranges, pursue hepatobiliary imaging and serologies if hepatic, evaluate bone and other non-hepatic causes if not, escalate to biopsy or disease-specific testing when unresolved, and tailor therapy and monitoring to the final diagnosis, adjusting expectations for spontaneous fluctuations and long-term risk [^a080bacb] [^c1d63df8] [^927019e1].

---

When alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is high, **confirm the elevation** by repeating the test and checking GGT to verify a hepatobiliary source [^a080bacb] [^c1d63df8]. If GGT is normal, **evaluate non-hepatic causes** such as bone disease, pregnancy, or malignancy [^584fd32f]. If GGT is elevated, **obtain a right upper quadrant ultrasound** to assess for biliary obstruction or liver disease [^d6a25fc0] [^927019e1]. Based on ultrasound results, pursue MRCP/ERCP for obstruction, autoimmune serologies for cholestatic liver disease, and consider liver biopsy if the cause remains unclear [^c1d63df8] [^bffc0f7b]. Management targets the underlying cause, with urgent intervention for obstruction or advanced liver disease [^6305141d].

---

## Step 1: confirm the elevation and determine the source

- **Repeat testing**: Confirm persistent elevation and exclude lab error [^a080bacb].
- **GGT measurement**: Elevated GGT supports hepatobiliary origin; normal GGT suggests bone, pregnancy, or malignancy [^c1d63df8] [^584fd32f].
- **Isoenzyme analysis**: If the source remains unclear, consider ALP isoenzymes to distinguish liver, bone, or intestinal origins [^584fd32f].

---

## Step 2: evaluate non-hepatic causes if GGT is normal

If GGT is normal, **evaluate non-hepatic causes**:

| **Category** | **Common causes** | **Initial evaluation** |
|-|-|-|
| Bone disease | - Paget's disease <br/> - Osteomalacia <br/> - Hyperparathyroidism <br/> - Bone metastases | - Serum calcium <br/> - Phosphate <br/> - PTH <br/> - 25(OH)D <br/> - Bone scan or skeletal survey [^ad5fe6fe] [^d0b11c2b] |
| Pregnancy | Placental ALP production | Confirm pregnancy and gestational age [^584fd32f] |
| Malignancy | - Bone metastases <br/> - Leukemia <br/> - Lymphoma | - Imaging (bone scan, CT, PET) <br/> - Tumor markers as indicated [^fb23043d] |

---

## Step 3: evaluate hepatic causes if GGT is elevated

If GGT is elevated, **proceed with hepatobiliary evaluation**:

- **Ultrasound**: First-line to assess for biliary obstruction, gallstones, or liver parenchymal disease [^d6a25fc0] [^927019e1].
- **MRCP/ERCP**: If ultrasound suggests obstruction or is inconclusive, evaluate for strictures, tumors, or PSC [^c1d63df8].
- **Autoimmune serologies**: AMA for PBC; ANA, ASMA, and IgG4 for PSC and autoimmune hepatitis [^bffc0f7b] [^a304495c].
- **Liver biopsy**: Consider if serologies and imaging are inconclusive or to stage disease [^a080bacb] [^927019e1].

---

## Step 4: management based on identified cause

Management is **cause-specific**:

- **Biliary obstruction**: Urgent ERCP or surgical intervention to relieve obstruction [^notfound].
- **Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC)**: Ursodeoxycholic acid; second-line agents (e.g. obeticholic acid) if inadequate response [^f4ff01d4].
- **Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)**: No definitive medical therapy; manage complications and consider liver transplantation [^notfound].
- **Bone disease**: Treat underlying condition (e.g. bisphosphonates for Paget's, vitamin D/calcium for osteomalacia) [^508b3144] [^3748f23b].
- **Malignancy**: Oncologic evaluation and treatment [^notfound].

---

## Step 5: monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring should track **ALP trends** and the **underlying condition**. For cholestatic liver disease, reassess liver chemistries every 3–6 months and adjust therapy accordingly [^notfound]. For bone disease, monitor ALP, calcium, phosphate, and PTH to guide therapy and detect relapse [^c68c58c0]. For malignancy, follow oncologic surveillance protocols [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Children**: Higher ALP is normal due to growth; evaluate for bone disease or biliary disorders if markedly elevated [^584fd32f].
- **Pregnancy**: ALP rises in late gestation; consider placental insufficiency if unusually high [^e618422a].
- **Medications**: Review for drugs causing cholestasis or bone turnover (e.g. anticonvulsants, glucocorticoids) [^584fd32f].

---

A high ALP requires a **structured approach**: confirm the elevation, localize the source with GGT, and tailor imaging and serologies to the likely etiology. Management focuses on the underlying cause, with close follow-up to track response and adjust therapy.

ACG Clinical Guideline — initial evaluation steps for abnormal liver chemistries emphasize confirming true abnormalities, medication/supplement review, selective biopsy, and GGT use. Before initiating a workup, repeat the laboratory panel and/or perform a clarifying test to confirm the abnormality. Physicians should ask about prescribed/over‑the‑counter drugs, complementary/alternative medicines, and dietary/herbal supplements that may be associated with drug‑induced liver injury (DILI). A liver biopsy is recommended when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible. An elevation of alkaline phosphatase should be confirmed with an elevation in gamma‑glutamyl transferase (GGT), and GGT should not be used as a screening test for underlying liver disease without other abnormal chemistries. All are stated as Strong recommendation, very low level of evidence.

Evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries — initial steps should confirm the abnormality and structure history and examination. Before initiation of evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries, one should repeat the lab panel and/or perform a clarifying test (e.g. GGT if serum alkaline phosphatase is elevated) to confirm that the liver chemistry is actually abnormal. The initial history should assess risk factors for liver diseases including viral hepatitis, metabolic liver disease, exposures to toxins, and medications including alcohol and complementary-alternative medicines, associated diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic diseases, pulmonary disease, and cardiac disease as well as hereditary forms of liver disease. In those who present with jaundice and abdominal pain, obtaining a history of prior hepatobiliary disease including gallstones and inflammatory bowel disease is recommended. The physical examination of a patient with abnormal liver tests is typically normal, but certain findings might help to confirm the presence of chronic liver disease including jaundice, ascites, splenomegaly, palmar erythema, spiders, and hepatic encephalopathy.

Purpose Of Review

Liver blood tests, including bilirubin, aminotransferases, and alkaline phosphatase, are among the most commonly encountered tests in medicine. With roles including the investigation of symptoms, medication monitoring, assessment of chronic disease, and routine assessment, these tests serve many purposes and result in abnormality in up to 40% of patients.

Recent Findings

The toll of liver disease continues to rise and abnormal liver tests offer an opportunity to identify hepatic disease early, when treatment is most effective and before patients suffer the potential downstream consequences of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma. By utilizing diagnostic strategies including detailed history gathering, alcohol use assessment, recognition of metabolic syndrome, and identifying patterns of liver test abnormalities, clinicians can develop a systematic approach to address abnormal liver tests. For these reasons, developing an evidence-based, systematic approach to handling abnormal liver tests is critically important.

Summary

This review seeks to synthesize key elements of the best evidence, presently available guidelines, and expert opinion in drafting a strategy to aid clinicians and patients in the timely and accurate diagnosis of liver disease for the adult asymptomatic patient with abnormal liver tests.

KDOQI US commentary — calcium measurement approach and alkaline phosphatase use: The work group did not recommend that corrected calcium measurement be abandoned at present, although recent data did not show superiority over total calcium alone, and it considered measurement of ionized calcium to be more specific, but presently not practical or cost-effective. The KDOQI Work Group recommends using total alkaline phosphatase activity as an adjunct test, which may provide supplemental information in the assessment of bone turnover, particularly in the setting of increased PTH levels and in the assessment of response to therapy for increased PTH levels if liver disease is not likely to be the cause of increased total alkaline phosphatase levels. Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase derives more specifically from bone and can be used when the clinical situation is more ambiguous; however, the test is not readily available. High total alkaline phosphatase levels have been associated with higher mortality, but it is not known whether therapies aimed at decreasing these levels improve patient outcomes. The KDOQI bone guideline also discussed that concomitant consideration of alkaline phosphatase levels can increase the predictive power of PTH levels; data were insufficient to determine the sensitivity and specificity of alkaline phosphatase levels for renal osteodystrophy alone or together with PTH levels, and the value of alkaline phosphatase for clinical decision making remains to be proved.

ACG clinical guideline — summary statements on abnormal liver chemistries state that liver chemistries including ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are markers of liver injury, not liver function, and should be referred to as liver chemistries, or liver tests; albumin, bilirubin, and prothrombin time are markers of hepatocellular function that can be influenced by extrahepatic factors; elevations of AST and/or ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin suggest hepatocellular injury and are the abnormal liver chemistries that require assessment and potential evaluation; ALT is a more specific marker of hepatic injury than AST; and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level of hepatic origin may be confirmed by elevation of gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) or fractionation of alkaline phosphatase.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^9f945fab]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — abnormal liver chemistries evaluation and interpretation states that serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are the most common liver chemistries; hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT compared with alkaline phosphatase, whereas cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase as compared with AST and ALT. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/l for males, 19 to 25 IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. Evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C; assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease; screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; and a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be pursued. Total bilirubin elevation can occur from hepatocellular or cholestatic diseases; elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

What constitutes a standard liver blood test panel?

There are remarkably few data to determine what an optimal liver blood test panel should include, although this would be influenced by the clinical setting. The Health Technology Assessment commissioned Birmingham and Lambeth Liver Evaluation Testing Strategies (BALLETS) study reported that ALT and ALP identified the vast majority of adults with necro-inflammatory liver disease. The routine addition of GGT led to a marginal increase in sensitivity but at the cost of a loss of specificity and a higher false-positive rate. But the analysis did not include adults with NAFLD or alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD), which account for 90% of liver mortality, in whom liver blood tests and the follow-on liver aetiology screen are seldom diagnostic. In this setting GGT and AST would aid the sensitivity of detecting such patients. Addition of GGT to a liver blood test panel increases the likelihood of an adult having abnormal liver blood tests from around 15% to 30%and, notably, a raised GGT is associated with increased liver as well as all-cause (including cancer) mortality, with the greatest risk being observed in those with the most significant elevations of GGT. In addition, the routine addition of AST to the initial panel did not improve the detection of specific disease.

Biochemical workup and features

The challenges associated with diagnostic testing have been recently reviewed by Brandi et al; for the purposes of this global guidance document, we will focus on the most salient points for clinicians to bear in mind. The first necessary step to diagnosis requires measuring serum phosphate in anyone being evaluated for musculoskeletal symptoms (Fig. 2). Serum phosphate should be measured on a morning, fasting blood specimen. Serum phosphate concentration is normally higher in young children and decreases with age; therefore, it is important to make sure that an age‐specific normal range is used. In adults, hypophosphatemia is defined as levels below 0.8 mmol/L (2.5 mg/dL). To establish chronic hypophosphatemia, there must be two values below the normal range on at least two occasions ≥ 2 weeks apart.

One study showed that, among 144 patients with TIO, 43.1% of cases with hypophosphatemia were not treated or misdiagnosed, and only 11.8% of patients seeking medical care for the first time were tested for serum phosphate.

Comprehensive laboratory evaluation should include complete blood count, fasting serum phosphate, serum creatinine, calcium, albumin, and total alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Additional variables, including PTH, 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH) 2 D, and FGF23, should also be measured (Table 3, Fig. 2). It should be emphasized that not all assays are standardized, and not all labs use the same reference values, so care must be taken when interpreting results.

Measurement of 25(OH)D levels is necessary for diagnosing vitamin D deficiency, a common cause of hypophosphatemia and rickets/osteomalacia that must be differentiated from TIO. However, vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency is frequent in the general population, and a low 25(OH)D level does not rule out the possibility of concurrent TIO. In fact, persistent hypophosphatemia after correction of vitamin D deficiency should prompt consideration that the patient may have TIO. Iron deficiency may indicate a need for potentially different patient management.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^c1d63df8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Cholestatic liver diseases — evaluation of elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and the role of gamma‑glutamyl transferase (GGT) is outlined as follows: cholestatic liver diseases are associated with elevated alkaline phosphatase, with or without elevated bilirubin, and once alkaline phosphatase has been confirmed to be of hepatic origin, an ultrasound of the liver should be performed to assess the hepatic parenchyma and bile ducts. Biliary dilatation suggests an extrahepatic cause, whereas a non-dilated biliary system suggests that the cause of elevated alkaline phosphatase is intrahepatic; some disease of extrahepatic cholestasis may not be apparent by ultrasound and cholangiography by MR/MRCP or endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography should be undertaken when these disorders are suspected. With isolated alkaline phosphatase elevation, confirmation with GGT, or fractionation of alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes can be used to help differentiate alkaline phosphatase from non-liver sources; however, GGT elevation is not specific for cholestatic liver disease and can be elevated in > 50% of alcoholic patients without obvious evidence of liver disease, so GGT should not be used as a screening test for underlying liver disease in the absence of abnormal liver chemistries. In hospitalized patients with isolated alkaline phosphatase elevations, one study reported that ~80% could be given a clinical diagnosis solely based on history and physical examination, routine labs, and chest X-ray.

Response to abnormal liver blood tests: outcomes and pathways￼

As indicated in figure 1 the presence of unexplained clinical jaundice or suspicion of possible hepatic or biliary malignancy should lead to an immediate referral. In all other adults with incidentally raised liver enzymes it is important to take a careful history and perform a targeted clinical examination to look for the cause. Liver enzymes can occasionally be raised owing to intercurrent illness, although when liver blood tests were repeated, 84% of tests remained abnormal on retesting after 1 month, and even at 2 years 75% remained abnormal. Thus, in a patient with abnormal liver blood tests it is not recommended to simply repeat the same panel of tests but to determine the cause unless there is a high index of clinical suspicion that it is a transient finding. In children, there should be a low threshold for referral to a paediatrician for further investigation, as the most common causes of liver dysfunction in adults are less common in children, and there is a wider differential diagnosis.

Figure 1
Response to abnormal liver blood tests. This figure details the initial response to abnormal liver blood tests. Boxes in yellow indicate the initial evaluation of the clinical presentation. Patients with marked derangement of liver blood tests, synthetic failure and/or suspicious clinical symptoms/signs should be considered for urgent referral to secondary care (red box). For the remainder, a clinical history alongside evaluation of the pattern of liver blood test derangement will determine choice of pathway and is shown in the grey boxes. A grey box indicates all the tests that should be requested at that stage rather than a hierarchy within it. The presence of metabolic syndrome criteria should be sought to support a diagnosis of NAFLD. For children, the text should be consulted for modification of recommendation. Areas of diagnostic uncertainty are indicated in orange boxes and the decision for repeat testing or referral to secondary care will be influenced by the magnitude of enzyme elevation and clinical context. Green boxes indicate final/definitive outcomes for users of the pathway. *Abnormal USS may well include extrahepatic biliary obstruction due to malignancy, which should result in urgent referral.

Figure 4 — Algorithm for evaluation of elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) delineates two branches. Under "Normal total bilirubin and serum transaminases", proceed with "History and physical exam confirm with serum GGT"; if "GGT normal → evaluate for non-hepatobiliary etiologies", but if "GGT abnormal → obtain right upper quadrant ultrasound, evaluate for potential hepatotoxic medications, check AMA, ANA, and SMA". If the evaluation is negative, then "If evaluation negative and alkaline phosphatase > 2x ULN → consider liver biopsy" or "If evaluation negative and alkaline phosphatase 1-2x ULN → consider observation", and "If AMA positive → evaluate for primary biliary cirrhosis/cholangitis", with persistence prompting "If persistent elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase after 6 months observation → consider liver biopsy". Under "Elevated serum transaminases ± elevated bilirubin", perform "History and physical exam Check right upper quadrant ultrasound"; if "If ductal dilatation → ERCP, MRCP" and if "If no ductal dilatation → check AMA, ANA, SMA". Next, "If AMA positive → evaluate for primary biliary cirrhosis/cholangitis", whereas "If AMA negative and alkaline phosphatase > 2x ULN → consider liver biopsy or MRCP" or "If AMA negative and alkaline phosphatase 1-2x ULN → consider observation", and persistent elevation leads to "If persistent elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase after 6 months observation → consider liver biopsy or MRCP".

Importance of context

Interpretation of abnormal liver blood tests requires an understanding of the context in which they arise. This can be illustrated in the extreme by a patient receiving statin therapy who has an ALT of 80 U/L, who is well and requires continued treatment with the statin compared with a patient with end-stage alcohol-related liver disease with an ALT in the normal reference interval at 30 U/L and who may have a life expectancy of weeks. A common assumption is that the detected abnormality represents the first presentation of abnormal LFTs, when it should be standard practice to review previous blood test records and past/current medical history before requesting additional investigations and referrals.

Another setting in which liver bloods are commonly abnormal but not necessarily of clinical concern is pregnancy where the alkaline phosphatase and serum albumin are often elevated and reduced, respectively. Other changes in liver bloods in this setting may indicate worsening of pre-existing disease or the development of pregnancy-related disease, which would warrant prompt investigation.

Recommendation 2: Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted after review of the previous results, past medical history and current medical condition. (level 5, grade D)

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^f8c52eff]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. These tests should be termed liver chemistries or liver tests. Hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels. Cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase level as compared with AST and ALT levels. The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin and an elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT has been associated with increased liver-related mortality. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33IU/l for males, 19 to 25IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation. The evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C, assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease, screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In addition, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For the evaluation of an alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be undertaken. Total bilirubin elevation can occur in either cholestatic or hepatocellular diseases. Elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

Elevation of total bilirubin level — evaluation and interpretation: Elevated serum total bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. The first step in investigating elevated bilirubin is determining conjugated (direct) vs. unconjugated (indirect) hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated unconjugated or indirect bilirubin is due to over-production, decreased hepatic uptake, or decreased hepatic conjugation. In Gilbert's syndrome, affecting 3–7% of the US population, total bilirubin levels almost never exceed 6 mg/dl and are usually < 3 mg/dl; fasting or significant illness can increase the unconjugated bilirubin by 2- to 3-fold and will decrease with eating or administration of phenobarbital. In hemolysis, hemolysis infrequently causes a bilirubin level > 5 mg/dl unless co-existent renal disease, liver disease, or severe acute hemolysis is present. In asymptomatic, healthy individuals with mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (< 4 mg/dl), evaluation should exclude medications that cause hyperbilirubinemia, exclude evidence of hemolysis, and confirm normal serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase levels; if these are found, then a presumptive diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome can be made and additional evaluation is not routinely necessary.

CKD-MBD serum markers for bone disease — parathyroid hormone (PTH) and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase — are addressed as follows: "In patients with CKD stages 3-5D, we suggest that serum PTH or bone-specific alkaline phosphatase measurement can be used to evaluate bone disease because markedly high or low values predict underlying bone turnover (2B)". The page notes that these levels "correlate with some histomorphometric measurements in bone biopsy specimens", but "the positive predictive value for both tests is only modest", and because biopsy "is not feasible in most patients", the group "issued a weak recommendation suggesting measurement of these serum markers because they may be useful to estimate bone turnover, especially when values are very abnormal", and "This recommendation is applicable to the United States".

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^8201f123]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin and cholestasis evaluation: In contrast to indirect hyperbilirubinemia, conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia generally implies the presence of parenchymal liver damage or biliary obstruction. There are two rare inherited conditions associated with direct hyperbilirubinemia: Dubin–Johnson syndrome and Rotor syndrome. An elevated bilirubin should be evaluated by determining conjugated and unconjugated fractions of bilirubin. If there are signs of acute liver failure, urgent hepatology consultation with referral to a liver transplant center should be undertaken immediately. Those who present with an elevation in alkaline phosphatase with normal AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels should have their alkaline phosphatase elevation confirmed with a GGT level and if elevated a right upper quadrant ultrasound of the liver should be ordered. If the imaging is normal, autoimmune markers should be ordered. A liver biopsy may ultimately be required to obtain a diagnosis. Extrahepatic causes such as hemolysis should also be assessed.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^584fd32f]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is produced mainly in the liver (from the biliary epithelium) but is also found in abundance in bone and in smaller quantities in the intestines, kidneys and white blood cells. Levels are physiologically higher in childhood, associated with bone growth, and in pregnancy due to placental production. Pathologically increased levels occur mainly in bone disease (eg, metastatic bone disease and bone fractures) and cholestatic liver disease — for example, primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, common bile duct obstruction, intrahepatic duct obstruction (metastases) and drug-induced cholestasis. Furthermore, hepatic congestion secondary to right-sided heart failure can also lead to cholestasis (elevated ALP levels and/or bilirubin).

When ALP is elevated in isolation, the measurement of γ-glutamyltransferase can indicate whether the ALP is of hepatic or non-hepatic origin. While there are no data on the most likely causes of an isolated raised ALP in an asymptomatic population, the the most common cause is likely to be vitamin D deficiency, or normal increase seen in childhood due to rapid growth. Other causes include Paget's disease and bony metastases. If doubt still exists, the use of electrophoresis to separate the isoenzymes of ALP can differentiate hepatic from non-hepatic causes of increased ALP.

AST and ALT are enzymes present in hepatocytes and are released into the blood stream in response to hepatocyte injury or death (hepatitis). Elevations in either of these enzymes are the the most common abnormality seen on liver blood test profiles. Both enzymes are present in many differing types of tissue, but ALT is considered more liver-specific since it is present in low concentrations in non-hepatic tissue, and non-liver related elevations are uncommon. However, AST is abundantly present in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle and so may be elevated in patients with myocardial infarction or myositis. Although ALT is considered a more specific indicator of liver disease, the concentration of AST may be a more sensitive indicator of liver injury in conditions such as alcohol-related liver disease and in some cases of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). In children, creatine kinase measurement may help to determine whether an isolated rise in ALT or AST is due to an underlying skeletal muscle disorder, such as muscular dystrophy.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^5b449e9b]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and prothrombin time interpretation includes that an elevated GGT suggests that the alkaline phosphatase elevation is of hepatic origin, alkaline phosphatase levels increase in children and the elderly, especially females over 50 years of age, and the total serum bilirubin is usually < 1.1 mg/dl with an elevated direct bilirubin indicating hepatocellular dysfunction or cholestasis; fractionation of total bilirubin is most helpful when the ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase levels are normal or near normal, and if the total bilirubin is elevated and fractionation shows the majority of the elevation is unconjugated bilirubin, hepatocellular disease is unlikely; albumin is a plasma protein exclusively synthesized by the liver with a circulating half-life of 3 weeks, a reduction in albumin (normal ≥ 3.5 g/dl) usually indicates liver disease of more than 3 weeks duration, and prothrombin time may be prolonged in patients with severe liver disease of < 24 h duration.

### Paget's disease of bone: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^ad5fe6fe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Paget's disease — biochemical evaluation after imaging: We recommend that after radiological diagnosis of Paget's disease, the initial biochemical evaluation of a patient should be done using serum total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or with the use of a more specific marker of bone formation when appropriate. In patients with radiological evidence of Paget's disease, measurement of serum total ALP is the least expensive biochemical test to determine the metabolic activity of the disorder, and although this bone formation marker increases secondary to bone resorption, it correlates well with the extent of skeletal involvement when assessed from radiographs or scintigraphy and with the probability of achieving normal values with a potent bisphosphonate.

Treatment of increased metabolic activity or symptoms?

The Paget's Disease, Randomized Trial of Intensive versus Symptomatic Management (PRISM) study compared the effects of a treat to target strategy aimed at normalizing total ALP compared with a strategy aimed at controlling symptoms 54 in 1324 patients with PDB. The average age of participants at entry to the study was about 74 years with an average disease duration of 8 years. About 70% of patients had previously been treated with bisphosphonates; about 47% had elevated total ALP values at baseline, and 46% had bone pain thought to be caused by PDB. There was a poor correlation between presence of bone pain thought to be due to PDB and an elevated ALP value, however. 54 Participants randomized to receive "intensive" bisphosphonate treatment (n = 661) were prescribed bisphosphonates with the aim of maintaining or suppressing total ALP values to within the reference range irrespective of whether bone pain was present. Risedronate sodium was the bisphosphonate of first choice, but any licensed bisphosphonate could be used. In the symptomatic group (n = 663), the therapeutic goal was to control bone pain. This was initially attempted using analgesics, but if the response was inadequate, non‐nitrogen‐containing bisphosphonates or calcitonin were used first followed by nitrogen‐containing bisphosphonates if necessary. The primary endpoint was clinical fracture. Secondary endpoints included fractures through Pagetic bone, orthopedic procedures, quality of life assessed by SF36, HAQ and EQ5D, bone pain, bone deformity, progression of hearing loss in patients with skull involvement assessed by audiometry, and adverse events. PRISM was an event‐driven study, which was stopped when 95 clinical fractures occurred. The average duration or follow‐up was 3 years with a range of 2 to 4 years.

The PRISM‐extension with zoledronic acid study (PRISM‐EZ) employed the same strategy as in PRISM, but zoledronic acid was used as the treatment of first choice in the intensive arm. 113 Patients within PRISM‐EZ maintained the same treatment allocation as they had been randomized to in PRISM. The PRISM‐EZ study followed 270 patients in the intensive group and 232 in the symptomatic group, providing an average total duration of 7.3 years follow‐up since the beginning of the PRISM study. The primary and secondary endpoints were the same in PRISM‐EZ as in PRISM, except that patients did not undergo audiometry in the extension.

### Alkaline phosphatase: discovery and naming of our favorite enzyme [^2acf770d]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2018). Low credibility.

Alkaline phosphatase can be considered "our favorite enzyme" for reasons apparent to those who diagnose and treat metabolic bone diseases or who study skeletal biology. Few might know, however, that alkaline phosphatase likely represents the most frequently assayed enzyme in all of medicine. Elevated activity in the circulation is universally recognized as a marker for skeletal or hepatobiliary disease. Nevertheless, the assay conditions in many ways are nonphysiological. The term alkaline phosphatase emerged when it became necessary to distinguish "bone phosphatase" from the phosphatase in the prostate that features an acidic pH optimum. Beginning in 1948, studies of the inborn-error-of-metabolism hypophosphatasia would identify the natural substrates and establish the physiological role of alkaline phosphatase, including in biomineralization. Here, we recount the discovery in 1923 and then eventual naming of this enzyme that remains paramount in our field. © 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

### Benign familial hyperphosphatasemia… [^d69fc4a8]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Elevated alkaline phosphatase activity in serum suggests bone or liver disease or a neoplasm but can also indicate pregnancy or another benign condition. A family with benign hyperphosphatasemia was studied to elucidate the genetics and enzyme defect. Serum total alkaline phosphatase activity was greater than the population mean in all six family members, and more than 7 SDs above the mean in two of four offspring. Monoclonal antibodies to three alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes, intestinal, placental, and tissue nonspecific, demonstrated markedly increased intestinal alkaline phosphatase levels in all family members and significantly elevated liver/bone/ kidney activity in the two offspring. Guanidine hydrochloride denaturation of the liver/bone/kidney component showed high alkaline phosphatase activity from liver in both siblings and from bone in one.

The mode of inheritance in this family is obscure, but a complex regulation of the products of two different alkaline phosphatase genes seems likely. Steps toward diagnosis are suggested. Early recognition of this benign biochemical abnormality should help to avoid unnecessary diagnostic tests. Siraganian PA, Mulvihill JJ, Mulivor RA, Miller RW. Benign Familial Hyperphosphatasemia.

### KDIGO 2017 clinical practice guideline update for the diagnosis, evaluation, prevention, and treatment of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone Disorder (CKD-MBD) [^dc3ff2c1]. Kidney International Supplements (2017). Medium credibility.

KDIGO CKD-MBD Chapter 3.1 — biochemical abnormalities recommends monitoring serum calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and alkaline phosphatase activity beginning in CKD G3a (1C), and in children it suggests such monitoring beginning in CKD G2 (2D). In CKD G3a–G5D, it is reasonable to base monitoring frequency on the presence and magnitude of abnormalities and CKD progression, with reasonable intervals specified as: CKD G3a–G3b — serum calcium and phosphate every 6–12 months and PTH based on baseline level and CKD progression; CKD G4 — serum calcium and phosphate every 3–6 months and PTH every 6–12 months; CKD G5, including G5D — serum calcium and phosphate every 1–3 months and PTH every 3–6 months; and CKD G4–G5D — alkaline phosphatase activity every 12 months or more frequently if PTH is elevated. In CKD patients receiving treatments for CKD-MBD or with biochemical abnormalities, it is reasonable to increase measurement frequency to monitor for trends and treatment efficacy and side effects. In CKD G3a–G5D, the guideline suggests that 25(OH)D (calcidiol) levels might be measured with repeat testing determined by baseline values and therapeutic interventions (2C) and suggests correcting vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency using treatment strategies recommended for the general population (2C). It recommends basing therapeutic decisions on trends rather than a single laboratory value, taking into account all available CKD-MBD assessments (1C), suggests using individual serum calcium and phosphate values together rather than calcium-phosphate product (Ca × P) (2D), and recommends that laboratories report assay method and any changes, sample source, and handling specifications to facilitate appropriate interpretation (1B).

Although we have made recommendations in 12 areas and conditional recommendations in five, the GDG noted that for several outcomes of clinical importance to patients, there was insufficient evidence to answer the questions posed in this guideline due to the fact that most clinical trials in PDB had been short term and focused on biochemical markers as the primary outcome, rather than patient‐reported outcome measures. Accordingly, the GDG felt that further research into PDB is warranted and identified the following topics as areas where research would be warranted (Table 29).

### Relationship between prostate-specific antigen, alkaline phosphatase levels, and time-to-tumor shrinkage: understanding the progression of prostate cancer in a longitudinal study [^af1f2a35]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Application to mixed longitudinal (PSA, ALP) and a time-to-tumor status prostate cancer study

Prostate cancer being the major cause of cancer deaths in men has increased the disease burden in terms of diagnosis and progression to assess the effectiveness of treatment. In the era from 1988 to the mid-1990s, was the only serum marker for prostate cancer and it is still used for diagnosis, measuring treatment efficacy, and recurrence of prostate cancer.is one of the older biomarkers for investigating and monitoring prostate cancer. Furthermore, it is a reliable indicator of bone metastases. Various authors have proved an increase in the clinical effectiveness of simultaneous measurement ofandin prostate cancer patients.

Our motivation for joint modeling of longitudinal and event time outcomes arises from a prostate cancer dataset collected from one of the most renowned public hospitals in Pakistan. This dataset includes patients who underwent various treatments and were followed to monitor PSA and ALP measurements until tumor shrinkage or censoring occurred. To study the effects of biomarkers on event time, we jointly modeled longitudinal PSA and ALP biomarkers along with tumor shrinkage outcomes.

The study included patients diagnosed with prostate cancer as their primary disease, who provided blood samples during follow-up visits spaced 28 to 30 days apart. The demographic characteristics of the study sample showed an age distribution ranging from 50 to 85 years, with a mean age of 68 years. Clinically, the patients varied in disease stage, with a significant number in advanced stages (stages III and IV), indicating a high-risk population.

Treatment histories of the patients included a mix of therapeutic approaches: surgery (prostatectomy), radiation therapy, hormone therapy (androgen deprivation therapy), and combinations thereof. This diversity in treatment history reflects the standard care practices for managing advanced prostate cancer and provides a comprehensive view of the patient population under investigation.

To remove variations caused by different scales of data, we standardized all continuous variables. Specifically, each variable was transformed by subtracting its mean and dividing by its standard deviation, resulting in variables with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This standardization ensures that all continuous variables contribute equally to the model and prevents those with larger scales from dominating the analysis.

Additional preprocessing steps included addressing missing data through multiple imputations to mitigate bias from incomplete datasets. Outliers were identified and assessed, with extreme values either transformed or excluded based on their influence on the overall analysis. Categorical variables were encoded using one-hot encoding to convert them into a format suitable for modeling.

How to Treat?

TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS* (GRADEd)

In children 12 months of age and older with XLH, we recommend burosumab therapy over conventional therapy (active vitamin D and phosphate salts) (strong recommendation, moderate certainty).
In children 6–12 months of age with XLH, we suggest burosumab therapy over conventional therapy (active vitamin D and phosphate salts) (conditional recommendation, low certainty).

* We recognize that there may be limitations to drug therapy accessibility

TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS (NON-GRADEd)

The panel proposes

Commence medical therapy promptly upon confirming XLH diagnosis and hypophosphatemia to optimize outcomes.
Treatment is directed at improving radiographic, biochemical and clinical signs of rickets (serum ALP, total or bone-specific), lower limb deformity, physical function, and the optimization of growth by addressing the mineral metabolism abnormalities of XLH.
When treating with burosumab, adhere to the recommended starting dose and adjust doses to achieve serum phosphorus levels in the low- to mid-normal (peak) or just below the normal or low-normal (trough) range for age, while avoiding hyperphosphatemia at any point in the dose cycle.
Optimal management with burosumab entails dose adjustments based on optimizing serum phosphorus levels for age rather than solely based on weight increases to avoid increasing the risk of hyperphosphatemia.
If burosumab is not available, children should be treated with conventional therapy (active vitamin D, usually combined with phosphate salts). Conventional therapy is advised over no treatment.
Active vitamin D can be administered with or without phosphate salts, but phosphate salts should not be used as monotherapy.
When treating with conventional therapy (active vitamin D with or without phosphate salts), avoid targeting normal fasting serum phosphorus levels to prevent phosphate overdosing or toxicity.
Adjust active vitamin D and oral phosphate therapy with the aim to lower, and to normalize alkaline phosphatase activity, if this can be safely achieved, and promote normal linear growth. However, phosphate doses exceeding 60 mg elemental phosphorus/kg/day are rarely well-tolerated. The active vitamin D dose should be decreased in the presence of persistent hypercalciuria. However, unbalanced increases in the phosphate doses without raising active vitamin D doses increases the risk of sustained hyperparathyroidism.
Consider decreasing the phosphate dose or increasing the active vitamin D dose (the latter, in the absence of hypercalciuria/hypercalcemia) if PTH levels are consistently elevated, as phosphate stimulates PTH secretion and calcitriol can suppress PTH.
The routine use of recombinant human growth hormone for children with XLH and short stature is not advised due to limited benefit noted in randomized clinical trials.
Early involvement of orthopedic surgery is crucial to assess for the necessity, and the timing of, any corrective procedures.
In tertiary hyperparathyroidism, multigland involvement is expected. Calcimimetics (ie, cinacalcet) can be used on an off-label basis to decrease PTH level in the setting of hypercalcemic hyperparathyroidism, while ensuring close monitoring of serum calcium in order to avoid hypocalcemia. If hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia cannot be controlled, subtotal parathyroidectomy should be considered.
Burosumab is contraindicated in chronic kidney disease (eGFR < 30 mL/min), and in acute kidney injury. Cautious use is advised if eGFR is between 30 and 60 mL/min with careful monitoring for hyperphosphatemia and changes in eGFR.
If clinic blood pressure measures consistently exceed the 95th percentile (for age and height) confirmation with 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring or serial home blood pressure measurements is indicated. Treatment should follow current pediatric hypertension recommendations.

Box 3 Recommendations for treatment in children

We recommend treating children with overt X-linked hypophosphataemia (XLH) phenotype with a combination of oral phosphorus (phosphate salts) and active vitamin D (calcitriol or alfacalcidol) as soon as diagnosis is established (grade B, moderate recommendation)
We recommend an initial dose of 20–60 mg/kg body weight daily (0.7–2.0 mmol/kg daily) of elemental phosphorus in infants and preschool children, which should be adjusted according to the improvement of rickets, growth, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels (grade C, moderate recommendation)
We recommend phosphate supplements should be taken as frequently as possible, for example, 4–6 times daily in young patients with high ALP levels. The frequency can be lowered to 3–4 times daily when ALP has normalized (grade B, moderate recommendation)
We recommend a progressive increase in the dose of phosphate supplements in cases of insufficient clinical response but avoidance of doses > 80 mg/kg daily (based on elemental phosphorus) to prevent gastrointestinal discomfort and hyperparathyroidism. If these adverse effects are present, treatment should be adjusted by decreasing the dose and/or increasing the frequency (grade C, moderate recommendation)
We recommend the use of low doses in patients with mild phenotypes, for instance, infants diagnosed by family screening (grade C, moderate recommendation)
We recommend an initial dose of calcitriol of 20–30 ng/kg body weight daily or alfacalcidol of 30–50 ng/kg body weight daily. Alternatively, treatment can be started empirically at 0.5 μg daily of calcitriol or 1 μg of alfacalcidol in patients > 12 months old and adjusted on the basis of clinical and biochemical responses (grade C, moderate recommendation)
To prevent nephrocalcinosis, we recommend keeping calciuria levels within the normal range and avoiding large doses of phosphate supplements; we suggest measures that decrease urinary calcium concentration, excretion and/or crystallization if necessary, including regular water intake, administration of potassium citrate and limited sodium intake (grade C, moderate recommendation)
With respect to secondary hyperparathyroidism, we recommend the following: Patients on conventional treatment with elevated PTH levels should be managed by increasing the dose of active vitamin D and/or decreasing the dose of oral phosphate supplements (grade C, moderate recommendation) Treatment with calcimimetics might be considered in patients with persistent secondary hyperparathyroidism despite the above-mentioned measures (grade D, weak recommendation). Cinacalcet should be used with caution in XLH, as it has been associated with severe adverse effects, namely, hypocalcaemia and increased QT interval (grade X, strong recommendation) Parathyroidectomy should be considered in case of tertiary hyperparathyroidism (persistent hypercalcaemic hyperparathyroidism) despite optimized active vitamin D and cinacalcet therapy (grade C, moderate recommendation)

### Alkaline phosphatase treatment of acute kidney injury-an update [^29b58ee4]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Through improved insights into the increasing incidence and detrimental effects of acute kidney injury (AKI), its clinical relevance has become more and more apparent. Although treatment strategies for AKI have also somewhat improved, an adequate remedy still does not exist. Finding one is complicated by a multifactorial pathophysiology and by heterogeneity in the patient population. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) has been suggested as a therapy for sepsis-associated AKI because of its protective effects against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation and kidney injury in animals. However, its effectiveness as an AKI treatment has not been demonstrated definitively. Because the anti-inflammatory properties of ALP are likely not reliant on a direct effect on LPS itself, we postulate that other pathways are much more important in explaining the renoprotective properties ascribed to ALP. The re-evaluation of which properties of the ALP enzyme are responsible for the benefit seen in the lab is an important step in determining where the true potential of ALP as a treatment strategy for AKI in the clinic lies. In this review we will discuss how ALP can prevent activation of harmful pro-inflammatory receptors, redirect cell-cell signalling and protect barrier tissues, which together form the basis for current knowledge of the role of ALP in the kidney. With this knowledge in mind and by analysing currently available clinical evidence, we propose directions for new research that can determine whether ALP as a treatment strategy for AKI has a future in the clinical field.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS OF NEW DATA ON THE MANAGEMENT OF PBC

Since the previous document was published, new data have emerged on approved therapies and treatment strategies with approved therapies that may improve disease management. This section will review these new data, analyze their clinical implications, and conclude with a practical treatment algorithm that incorporates these advances.

Definition of an inadequate biochemical response to UDCA

Response to UDCA has historically been assessed after 12 months of treatment according to various binary response criteria and quantitative prognostic scores. Lack of biochemical response is reported in 25%–50% of treated patients and has been associated with a > 5-fold increase in risk of progression to cirrhosis and a 3-fold increase in age-adjusted mortality. At this time, clinicians are encouraged to use 2 liver biochemistries as the anchor for clinical judgment when determining candidates for second-line therapy in PBC: ALP and bilirubin levels. If elevated above the ULN, bilirubin is more important than ALP for prognosis and in identifying advanced stage of PBC in the absence of Gilbert syndrome or another explanation. However, most patients will have elevated ALP levels rather than elevated bilirubin levels. For example, in a patient with a normal ALP, advanced fibrosis stage, and bilirubin > ULN, adding a second-line therapy can be considered. Additional factors to consider include the patient's age and acceptance of additional medications.

Screening and assessment for rickets and vitamin D status: ALP may be used to screen for rickets, but rickets has sometimes been reported with normal ALP levels; when a high index of suspicion exists, a wrist or knee radiograph should be obtained, and the best way to assess vitamin D status is to measure 25(OH)-D levels.

### Application of the latest advances in evidence-based medicine in primary biliary cholangitis [^f87d1687]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

It is becoming increasingly clear that our goal in treating PBC is evolving to target greater reductions in ALP and bilirubin than what was recommended in the past. It is our opinion that the goal after adding a second-line therapy for PBC is to achieve the lowest ALP level possible. We recommend that ALP response to UDCA be assessed 6–12 months after UDCA initiation and that the second-line therapy be considered (see the following section, Up-to-date PBC algorithm). It is also important to apply proper medical judgment and consider other factors when adding a second-line therapy. For instance, exposing an older patient with stage I disease and an ALP of 150 U/L to a second or third drug knowing that it will not alter their clinical course but will lower their ALP would not be the best approach. Given the recent restriction established on the use of OCA in patients with advanced cirrhosis, it is also important to restage the liver disease and carefully evaluate for signs of portal hypertension before starting OCA. Finally, it seems likely that our treatment goals in PBC will evolve over time to achieve complete biochemical remission (normal or near-normal ALP and bilirubin levels).

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^74b4a2f6]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Recommendations list

Recommendation 1: Initial investigation for potential liver disease should include bilirubin, albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT), together with a full blood count if not already performed within the previous 12 months. (level 2b, grade B)
Research Recommendation 1: Further evidence is required to establish the cost-effectiveness of case finding for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in high-risk groups before it can be recommended. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 2: Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted after review of the previous results, past medical history and current medical condition. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 3: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte which is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 4: Patients with abnormal liver blood tests should be considered for investigation with a liver aetiology screen irrespective of level and duration of abnormality. Abnormal refers to an analyte which is outside the laboratory reference range (level 2b, grade B)
Recommendation 5: In adults a standard liver aetiology screen should include abdominal ultrasound scan (USS), hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody (with follow-on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) if positive), anti-mitochondrial antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, serum immunoglobulins, simultaneous serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. (level 2b, grade C)
Recommendation 6: In children, ferritin and transferrin saturation may not be indicated, but autoantibody panel should include anti-liver kidney microsomal antibody and coeliac antibodies. Alpha-1-antitrypsin level and caeruloplasmin (age > 3 years) should be included, and abnormalities discussed with an appropriate inherited metabolic disease specialist. (level 2b, grade C)
Recommendation 7: Adults with NAFLD should undergo risk stratification to determine the extent of their liver fibrosis (figures 1 and 2). First-line testing should use either fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) or NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS) – see table 3 (level 2b, grade B). Calculation facilities for FIB-4 and NFS should be incorporated in all primary care computer systems. (level 5, grade D) Second-line testing requires a quantitative assessment of fibrosis with tests such as serum enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) measurements or Fibroscan/acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography. (level 2b, grade B) We recommend that hepatologists at a local level champion this idea and discuss it with commissioners of health to deal with the burden of liver disease in their area.
Recommendation 8: Consider referral to alcohol services for all adults with alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) with evidence of alcohol dependency as defined by an AUDIT score of > 19. (level 3b, grade C)
Recommendation 9: Harmful drinkers should undergo risk stratification with clinical assessment and Fibroscan/ARFI elastography. Adults should be referred to secondary care if there is evidence of advanced liver disease (features of cirrhosis or portal hypertension on imaging or from blood tests) and/or Fibroscan reading is > 16 kPa (if available). (level 2b, grade B)
Research Recommendation 2: Further evidence is required to establish the most cost-effective approach to identify patients with ARLD and NAFLD at risk of having advanced liver fibrosis.
Recommendation 10: Adults with abnormal liver blood tests, even with a negative extended liver aetiology screen and no risk factors for NAFLD, should be referred/discussed to a gastroenterologist with an interest in liver disease/hepatologist for further evaluation (figure 1). (level 4, grade C)

### Clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of X-linked hypophosphataemia [^a0bc529c]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

Biochemical follow-up

Serum level of ALP is a reliable biomarker of rickets activity and osteomalacia in children and adults. Given that bone-specific ALP represents ~80–90% of total ALP in the serum of children, total ALP might be used in this population. In adults, bone-specific ALP is preferred given that ~50% of circulating ALP originates from hepatocytes. When rachitic or osteomalacic bones are undertreated, ALP levels are elevated and urinary levels of calcium are usually low. By contrast, when rickets is healed, ALP levels tend to normalize and urinary calcium levels start to increase. PTH should be measured regularly as secondary hyperparathyroidism is promoted by oral phosphate supplementation. Suppressed PTH levels suggest that the dose of active vitamin D is disproportionately high compared with phosphate supplementation. Measurement of serum and urinary levels of calcium is required to evaluate the safety of active vitamin D. Spot urine samples are preferred as they are simple to perform, especially in young children. Alternatively, 24-hour urine collections can be performed in toilet-trained patients. We do not recommend regular measurement of serum levels of FGF23 in treated patients as it does not guide therapy.

In patients treated with burosumab, fasting serum phosphate level is a biomarker of efficacy and should be monitored to titrate the treatment in children and to exclude hyperphosphataemia. In some patients, burosumab might initially normalize TmP/GFR while serum level of phosphate is still below the normal range owing to the high demand for phosphate of the bone. In this setting, an increase in burosumab dose will not necessarily result in improved bone healing. Therefore, we suggest that TmP/GFR should be analysed together with fasting serum phosphate levels as a measure of drug efficacy. Serum levels of 1,25(OH) 2 vitamin D might increase under burosumab therapy; we suggest measuring these levels every 6 months and analysing them together with the urinary calcium excretion as safety parameters.

### How to use… alkaline phosphatase in neonatology [^cab02da0]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2012). Low credibility.

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is regularly measured in clinical practice. Changes in serum levels are observed in a number of clinical conditions. In neonatology, it has been proposed as a useful marker for both a diagnosis and an indication of the severity of metabolic bone disease (MBD) in infants born preterm. Nutritional practices, aimed at reducing the occurrence or severity of MBD, have led to ALP being proposed as a stand-alone means of monitoring treatment. The current evidence does not support this use: ALP only achieves usefulness in a diagnostic and monitoring capacity when combined with other serum and imaging techniques.

### The British society of gastroenterology / UK-PBC primary biliary cholangitis treatment and management guidelines [^3dc64282]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

What other conditions should be considered in the differential diagnosis of PBC?

The diagnosis of PBC usually causes little confusion because of the specificity and sensitivity of PBC-associated autoantibodies. Care must be taken in autoantibody-negative disease, with the chief differential being small duct PSC. Other differential diagnoses which should be considered include sarcoid, graft-versus-host disease (in appropriately at-risk individuals), idiopathic ductopenia, drug-induced liver injury and variants of genetic cholestatic syndromes. Care must also be taken with patients with 'low titre' AMA because of the danger of autoantibody false positivity in inflammatory conditions, in particular NAFLD, where low level rises in ALP are not infrequent.

### Monitoring guidance for patients with hypophosphatasia treated with asfotase alfa [^e5a787ec]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis considerations for hypophosphatasia — Diagnosis in patients of any age can be established based on characteristic signs, symptoms, and complications together with consistently low age- and sex-adjusted serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity after excluding other causes of low ALP and skeletal diseases with similar presentations. Because the lower limit of normal for ALP varies by age and sex, measured activity must be compared with the lower limit and range appropriate for the patient. Physicians should be aware that many institutions do not routinely flag low ALP and may incorrectly apply adult ALP reference ranges to all ages, and the report emphasizes that age- and sex-adjusted ALP reference intervals are critical to an accurate diagnosis of HPP.

### Paget's disease of bone: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^c68c58c0]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Paget's disease of bone — monitoring response, remission targets, relapse assessment, and monostotic disease guidance includes that if there is urgency in the control of symptoms or the disease is particularly active, we suggest the use of short-term response of bone resorption markers before and shortly after treatment to indicate that an adequate therapeutic response is likely; we suggest that patients who have osteolytic lesions have a repeat x-ray approximately 1 year after radiological diagnosis, with subsequent x-rays considered in the event of persistent elevations of biochemical markers of bone turnover or the presence of bone pain and to determine when there is resolution of the lesion; to maximize the duration of remission, we suggest that bone turnover should be reduced below the midpoint of the reference range for the chosen monitoring bone turnover marker; in patients with increased bone turnover, we recommend that biochemical follow-up be used as a more objective indicator of relapse than symptoms; and for untreated monostotic disease, we suggest that amino-terminal propeptide of type 1 collagen (P1NP) or bone-specific ALP (BSAP) and βCterminal propeptide of type 1 collagen (βCTx) or N-terminal propeptide of type 1 collagen (NTx) should be used for assessing activity, although these may be normal when evidence of disease activity is still clearly demonstrated on scintigraphy.

### Differential diagnosis of perinatal hypophosphatasia: radiologic perspectives [^fd010787]. Pediatric Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Suspicion of hypophosphatasia: Next steps

If perinatal HPP is suspected, alkaline phosphatase activity may be assessed in umbilical cord blood or chorionic villus samples. Chorionic villus sampling for assay of alkaline phosphatase activity has been used to diagnose HPP as early as 11–12 weeks' gestation. In some cases, however, alkaline phosphatase activity may fail to identify affected fetuses, as alkaline phosphatase activity varies with gestational age. After 13 weeks' gestation, the placenta may produce alkaline phosphatase, affecting the interpretation of the analysis.

Measurement of parental serum alkaline phosphatase activity can be useful for prenatal diagnosis of HPP. A retrospective analysis of 77 cases of fetal skeletal dysplasia (including 17 of HPP) in Japan from 2007 to 2016 showed that the presence of at least one abnormally low maternal (< 123 IU/L) or paternal alkaline phosphatase value (< 165 IU/L) any time during pregnancy had high sensitivity (82%) specificity (75%), and positive predictive value (80%) for HPP.

For newborns, alkaline phosphatase activity must be compared with age- and gender-adjusted reference ranges for the testing laboratory; alkaline phosphatase reference ranges vary widely depending on patient age and gender and the laboratory and methods used. If alkaline phosphatase activity is low or suspicion for HPP is high based on images, additional testing may be necessary. In newborns, these tests should include urine concentrations of phosphoethanolamine, and serum concentrations of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (i.e. vitamin B6), calcium, vitamin D and parathyroid hormone.

Genetic testing for ALPL mutations can be confirmatory in cases of diagnostic uncertainty. However, clinicians should be aware of the depth of coverage with whole-exome sequencing and next-generation sequencing technology, as some pathogenic variants may not be detected.

### Paget's disease of bone: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^d0b11c2b]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Paget's disease of bone — diagnostic imaging and biochemical monitoring recommendations state that We recommend that plain radiographs be obtained of the pertinent regions of the skeleton in patients with suspected Paget's disease. If the diagnosis is confirmed, we suggest that a radionuclide bone scan be done to determine the extent of the disease. After diagnosis, we recommend measurement of serum total alkaline phosphatase or, when warranted, a more specific marker of bone formation or bone resorption to assess response or disease evolution; in monostotic disease with a normal serum total alkaline phosphatase, we suggest that a specific marker of bone formation and bone resorption be measured, and serial radionuclide bone scans may determine the response to treatment if the markers are normal.

### Associations of serum alkaline phosphatase with metabolic syndrome and mortality [^adb67f47]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Recent data suggest that elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels are associated with increased mortality, but the mechanisms for this association are unknown. As metabolic syndrome is associated with higher serum alkaline phosphatase levels, we examined the joint association of mortality with metabolic syndrome and serum alkaline phosphatase levels in the US general population.

Methods

Retrospective observational study of 15,234 adult participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to jointly relate mortality risk to serum alkaline phosphatase and indicators of metabolic syndrome.

Results

Prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 14% to 41% among patients in lowest and higher quartiles, respectively, for baseline serum alkaline phosphatase. The mortality hazard ratio for each doubling of serum alkaline phosphatase was 1.52 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35–1.72) adjusting only for demographic factors, and 1.37 (95% CI, 1.21–1.56) adjusting for both demographic and metabolic syndrome factors in the full cohort, and was 1.83 (95% CI, 1.36–2.46) adjusting for demographic factors in the subgroup without any of the component conditions of metabolic syndrome.

Conclusions

In the US general population, higher levels of serum alkaline phosphatase is a predictor of mortality independent of the baseline prevalence of metabolic syndrome. Further studies are warranted to unravel the mechanisms of this association.

### High alkaline phosphatase levels in hemodialysis patients are associated with higher risk of hospitalization and death [^6fdde178]. Kidney International (2008). Low credibility.

We evaluated risks associated with elevated alkaline phosphatase in hemodialysis patients using longitudinal data from the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study, a prospective observational study of hemodialysis patients in 12 countries. Alkaline phosphatase levels were normalized by the upper limit of the laboratory-reported reference range. Cause-specific hospitalization and mortality risks were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models, stratified by region and adjusted for phosphorus, calcium, albumin, parathyroid hormone, case mix, and numerous comorbidities. The odds of high normalized alkaline phosphatase were increased twofold in the United States in comparison to Japan. Elevations of normalized alkaline phosphatase were significantly associated with several comorbid conditions, increased fractures, parathyroidectomy, risk of hospitalization due to major adverse cardiac events, higher all-cause cardiovascular, and infection-related mortality risk. Our results also show that elevated serum normalized alkaline phosphatase was associated with higher risks of hospitalization and death in hemodialysis patients, independent of calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone levels.

### Does an abnormally elevated maternal alkaline phosphatase pose problems for the fetus? [^e618422a]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

We report a potential association between an abnormally raised pregnancy level of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). There are few reports of women with abnormally high ALP during pregnancy. However, there is work to suggest an association with placental insufficiency, low birth weight and preterm delivery. In conjunction with a rising ALP, fetal IUGR and intermittent absence of umbilical artery end diastolic flow had evolved. A greatly elevated ALP may be a marker for placental insufficiency and IUGR.

How is PBC diagnosed?

Modes and routes of presentation

Increased awareness of the serological associations of PBC and the widespread use of blood test-based screening in the community has led to an evolution of the mode of presentation of PBC in recent years, away from presentation with clinically overt disease (eg, advanced liver disease)towards presentation following identification of liver biochemical abnormality on screening(figure 1). Increasing awareness of PBC as a cause of chronic fatigue and pruritus may have led to an increase in diagnosis following symptomatic presentation. Given the efficacy of UDCA treatment in slowing disease progression, it makes sense that early diagnosis may facilitate better outcomes. Treatment failure is seen more commonly in those presenting with cirrhosis and in the ductopenic variant of PBC. Despite awareness of PBC and its target demographic, occasional patients still present with very advanced disease at the point of needing liver transplantation.

Figure 1
The BSG/UK-PBC consensus care pathway for patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). While care needs always to be personalised to the patient, there are consensus pathways that are important for patients with PBC, which encompass the important 'pillars' of care that are believed to provide optimal management of disease and its complications.

Blood tests

The diagnostic accuracy of the combination of cholestatic serum liver tests and PBC-specific serological markers (> 95% for both sensitivity and specificity) means that blood tests lie at the heart of PBC diagnosis.

Liver biochemistry

PBC is characterised, in its early stages, by elevation in serum ALP and GGT. Multiple studies on the biochemical response to UDCA therapy demonstrate the value of ALP following therapy as a useful prognostic marker. It is unclear at present whether ALP values are markers of response to other emerging forms of therapy in PBC, but recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory review has suggested there is at least reasonable evidence to consider ALP as a surrogate marker of treatment efficacy in PBC. Elevation in bilirubin and fall in serum albumin are features of advanced disease and are also important prognostic markers. Given the more diverse causes of elevations in GGT, to date the utility of GGT determination in patients with PBC has been to confirm a biliary origin of ALP, and not usually to reach a diagnosis or guide therapy. Further studies need to be performed before GGT can replace ALP with regard to diagnosis and treatment, although in the context of classical cholestasis a strong correlation between the two laboratory markers exists.

Paget's disease of bone — diagnosis imaging and biochemistry guidance states: In patients with suspected Paget's disease, we recommend obtaining plain radiographs of the suspicious regions of the skeleton, and in patients diagnosed with Paget's disease, we suggest a radionuclide bone scan to determine the extent of the disease and identify possible asymptomatic sites. After radiological diagnosis of Paget's disease, the initial biochemical evaluation should be done using serum total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or with the use of a more specific marker of bone formation when appropriate, and we recommend measuring a specific marker of bone formation or resorption in patients with Paget's disease and abnormal liver or biliary tract function to assess response to treatment or follow evolution of the disease in untreated patients.

### Alkaline phosphatase is an independent risk factor for periprosthetic fractures in total joint arthroplasty [^e4014a81]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Overall, although it is difficult for providers to identify at-risk patients for postoperative periprosthetic fractures and complications, this study suggests the utility of obtaining a CMP before elective arthroplasty to evaluate serum ALP levels. It is important for healthcare providers to understand the implications of a high ALP level and understand that serum levels may also be reflective of patients with biliary obstruction, colon cancer, liver disease, vitamin D deficiency, and Paget disease. Abnormal ALP levels during preoperative visits may alert and help providers to suspect underlying metabolic disease and seek additional medical workup and optimization before elective arthroplasty. Understanding patient expectations and identifying comorbidities is an important part of being able to improve outcomes and prevent unexpected complications. With the increasing use of ALP as a biomarker for underlying bone mineral dysregulation, previous studies have advocated for increased vitamin D supplementation, smoking cessation, liver protective supplementation, alcohol cessation, and daily intake of vegetables such as broccoli, onions, and cabbage as ways to proactively improve ALP levels. However, future studies are needed to investigate whether serum ALP levels can be normalized in a realistic time line before elective arthroplasty.

Despite the large number of patients included, there are limitations to consider when using the NSQIP database, including selection bias. Although the national database is unable to differentiate bone-specific ALP from serum ALP, not all studies have confirmed the value of bone-specific ALP as a marker of bone formation and may be because of differences in study populations. In fact, there is a mixed consensus on the role of bone-specific ALP in predicting bone mineral density and risk of fractures. Although the data comprise a heterogeneous population nationwide at different ambulatory settings, the wide variety of ambulatory centers and surgeon expertise may confound recorded outcomes. Although various institutions may implement different preoperative pathways for joint arthroplasty, patients from both academic and private practice settings in rural and urban centers reflect the generalizability of our results. Furthermore, it is possible that we were not able to record all cases of postoperative periprosthetic fractures because the database is limited to short 30-day complication rates. Final limitation of this study is not considering inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and CRP, which are often linked with abnormal ALP levels because the data were not available in the NSQIP database.

Osteosarcoma — prognostic serum markers and survival: Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are identified as prognostic indicators, with higher LDH at presentation in metastatic versus localized disease in a cohort of 1421 extremity cases (36.6% vs. 18.8%; P < .0001), and 5-year disease-free survival correlated with LDH (39.5% for high LDH vs 60% for normal). In a retrospective analysis of 789 extremity cases, ALP was a significant prognostic factor for event-free survival, with 5-year EFS 24% when serum ALP was more than four times the normal value and 46% when elevated below this limit (P < .001). However, in multivariate analyses, these markers did not retain prognostic significance when compared with tumor volume, age, and histologic response to chemotherapy.

### X-linked hypophosphatemia management in children: an international working group clinical practice guideline [^b37244e7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is a rare, inherited disorder primarily affecting the skeleton and teeth in children. XLH is caused by pathogenic loss-of-function variants in the phosphate-regulating endopeptidase homolog, X-linked (PHEX) gene, leading to increased fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and chronic hypophosphatemia secondary to renal phosphate wasting. This manifests as impaired bone mineralization and skeletal deformities in affected children. Loss of PHEX protein may also have direct effects on skeletal integrity outside of its effect on FGF23, phosphate, and activated vitamin D, which are currently under study. Other biochemical findings in children may include elevated levels of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), although adults with XLH may have normal serum ALP despite frank hypophosphatemia and active osteomalacia.

While dental infections are common in both children and adults with XLH, other disease comorbidities such as enthesopathy, arthritis, and spinal stenosis primarily manifest in adulthood. This manuscript summarizes current evidence as well as recommendations based on an expert clinical practice survey regarding diagnosis and management of XLH in children. We also provide additional details regarding the features of XLH in children that are important in confirming the diagnosis and in the, monitoring and management of XLH.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^3748f23b]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency in children — monitoring therapy includes scheduled labs and imaging. It is important to obtain calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels 1 month after initiating therapy, and with stoss therapy a biochemical response occurs in 1 or 2 weeks with an early increase in phosphate; ALP may actually increase in the short term, there is usually an initial increase in 1,25(OH)2-D, then ALP and 1,25(OH)2-D decrease to normal while 25(OH)-D increases to within the reference range. Complete radiologic healing may take months, but changes are evident in 1 week. In 3 months, it is important to obtain calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, ALP, 25(OH)-D, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, and one may consider obtaining a urine sample to determine the calcium/creatinine ratio. A radiograph should be repeated at 3 months, and subsequently 25(OH)-D levels should be monitored yearly.

### Medical treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis: what have we learned and where are we going? [^57de433a]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

THE PROS AND CONS OF ALP IN PSC

An elevated serum ALP level above the upper limit of normal (ULN) is part of the diagnostic criteria of PSC in adults in the EASL, but not in the AASLD clinical practice guidelines. According to the AASLD guidelines, the cholangiographic features of PSC, along with the exclusion of secondary sclerosing cholangitis, is sufficient for making a diagnosis, accounting for the fact that a significant proportion of individuals with PSC may have normal ALP levels. As PSC is increasingly diagnosed at earlier disease stages along with increased attention and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) availability and quality, omission of the elevated ALP criterion of the diagnosis, as now implemented in the AASLD guidelines, may be particularly relevant. High levels of ALP are associated with a more severe disease stratum, while normal levels are associated with a better prognosis. ALP is thus included in several prognostic models for PSC, including the Amsterdam-Oxford score, the UK-PSC score, and the PREsTO score. However, the intraindividual variability of ALP is considerable, and spontaneous normalization of ALP frequently occurs.,

Biology of ALP

ALPs are glycoproteins bound to the plasma membrane and are widely distributed in nature. In humans, zinc and magnesium serve as significant cofactors for their biological activity. ALPs exist in 4 different isoforms: intestinal ALP, placental ALP, germ cell ALP, and liver/bone/kidney (ie, tissue-nonspecific) ALP. Over 80% of the ALPs in serum originate from the liver and bone. Although ALPs are found in numerous tissues, their exact physiological function remains largely unknown. Elevated activity in the circulation is a marker for skeletal remodeling or hepatobiliary disease, but clinical variations in serum ALP levels also commonly occur in endocrine disorders such as thyroid disease, hematological diseases, malnutrition, and vitamin deficiencies. Genetic variation, for instance related to bile acid transport and glycobiology, associates with ALP levels in apparently healthy individuals. It is currently unknown to what extent ALP serves an integral part of cholestatic liver disease pathophysiology or merely represents a marker of biliary injury, altered bile composition, and cholestasis.

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^9107c0ca]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Biochemical liver tests — patterns in Wilson disease include that serum aminotransferase activities are generally abnormal except at a very early age (infancy), and the elevation may be relatively mild and disproportionate to the severity of liver disease. In patients with cirrhosis, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is often elevated at levels above alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Transient hyperbilirubinemia, mainly unconjugated, may occur with brief self-limited episodes of hemolysis. Low-normal or subnormal serum alkaline phosphatase is typical of Wilson disease associated with intravascular hemolysis; it is also found with severe disease not meeting criteria for ALF (acute liver injury [ALI] without hepatic encephalopathy) and may be associated with episodic hemolysis.

### Patient-derived reference intervals for alkaline phosphatase to support appropriate utility for isoenzymes determinations and hypophosphatasia [^c5c7173a]. Laboratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Appropriate age- and sex-specific reference intervals for alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are essential to identify patients with hypophosphatasia (low ALP) and to avoid unnecessary ALP isoenzymes analysis (elevated ALP). This study used patient ALP historical data to statistically derive sex- and age-specific reference intervals.

Methods

The ALP values reported as part of clinical management during an 18 month period (from July 2021 to March 2023) were obtained. Following logarithmic transformation of ALP data and repeated removal of outliers, cumulative frequency plots were generated using a modified Hoffmann approach to derive age- and sex-specific reference intervals.

Results

Age-specific ALP reference intervals ranged from 110 to 250 and 120 to 295 U/L for males and females < 15 days old, 80 to 400 and 90 to 380 U/L for males and females 15 days to 1 year old, 105 to 280 and 90 to 290 U/L for males and females 1 to 10 years old, 75 to 300 and 90 to 300 U/L for males and females 10 to 13 years old, 80 to 300 and 60 to 175 U/L for males and females 13 to 15 years old, 55 to 150 and 60 to 180 U/L for males and females 15 to 18 years old, and 55 to 140 and 60 to 147 U/L for male and female adults, respectively (> 18 years old).

Conclusion

By applying derived ranges, a retrospective review of ALP isoenzymes would eliminate 24.5% of requests. Additionally, 9 neonates would have required investigation for possible hypophosphatasia.

### Bone turnover markers: basic biology to clinical applications [^5db47068]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

BTMs (total ALP and bone ALP) have been proposed to monitor the effect of treatment; a decrease of 25% or more after treatment is considered significant. On the other hand, an increase of more than 25% from the nadir during the off-treatment period, should prompt physicians to check for symptoms and consider treatment. A recent study used this approach to define treatment responders to risedronate.

There have been debates as to whether treatment should be aimed at treating symptoms or whether a treat-to-target strategy should be followed, ie, aiming to normalize ALP. The current guidance is to aim for the relief of symptoms. Bisphosphonates are the drugs of choice, while medications like denosumab and calcitonin have limited use.

Conclusion

BTMs are very useful in diagnosing Paget's disease and the recommended marker is ALP. PINP and bone ALP can also be used depending on the clinical situation. The current practice is to treat patients according to their symptoms and not aim to normalize BTMs.

AUA renal mass follow-up — bone scan use directs that patients undergoing follow-up for treated malignant renal masses should only undergo bone scan if one or more of the following is present: clinical symptoms such as bone pain, elevated alkaline phosphatase, or radiographic findings suggestive of a bony neoplasm (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). The text also notes that the routine use of bone scan in the absence of bone pain or elevated ALP should not be pursued, although with the presence of symptoms and/or elevated marker, radionuclide bone scan can be a useful test.

### Clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of X-linked hypophosphataemia [^ab8d8dcf]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

Biochemical characteristics

The biochemical hallmarks of XLH are hypophosphataemia due to renal phosphate wasting, increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels and elevated intact FGF23 levels. A positive family history of XLH, elevated ALP levels, decreased serum phosphate concentrations associated with renal phosphate wasting and/or the identification of a PHEX mutation can help to identify affected children within the first weeks of life. Of note, serum levels of phosphate might be in the normal range within the first 3–4 months of life. Renal phosphate wasting should be evaluated by calculating the tubular maximum reabsorption of phosphate per glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR)(Table 1). In patients with insufficient phosphate intake, or impaired intestinal absorption (which might be suspected by low urinary levels of phosphate), TmP/GFR can be falsely low until serum levels of phosphate are restored to normal. Although, plasma levels of intact FGF23 are usually elevated, normal levels of FGF23 do not exclude XLH but should be interpreted as inappropriately normal in the setting of hypophosphataemia. FGF23 levels are also influenced by other factors, in particular phosphate intake and vitamin D therapy. Therefore, FGF23 levels are most informative in untreated patients. FGF23 levels are elevated in several other forms of hypophosphataemic rickets (Table 2), and the normal range varies considerably according to the assay used. Serum concentrations of calcium are usually in the lower normal range, and urinary calcium is low owing to impaired 1,25(OH) 2 vitamin D synthesis and consequently decreased intestinal calcium absorption. In contrast to calcipenic rickets, parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels are usually at the upper limit of the normal range or even slightly elevated. Circulating levels of 1,25(OH) 2 vitamin D are low or inappropriately normal in the setting of hypophosphataemia.

### Persistently elevated alkaline phosphatase [^ff84e3bc]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

A 32-year-old overweight asymptomatic man was found to have a persistently raised serum alkaline phosphatase at 250–300&emsp14; U/l (normal range < 130). Other liver function tests were unremarkable apart from an initial marginally elevated alanine transaminase, which normalised with weight reduction. Abdominal imaging revealed a fatty liver but an extensive serological search for significant hepatobiliary disease was negative. Subsequent isoenzyme electrophoresis revealed normal liver and bone fractions of alkaline phosphatase but a grossly elevated intestinal fraction. Elevated intestinal fraction of alkaline phosphatase should be considered in the investigation of unexplained alkaline phosphatase, particularly when the usual associated hepatobiliary and bony pathologies are not present. Although an elevated intestinal fraction of alkaline phosphatase can be linked to significant gastrointestinal pathology, this case report highlights that it can be a benign biochemical finding.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^b59e34c7]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

γ-Glutamyltransferase (GGT) is abundant in the liver and also present in the kidney, intestine, prostate and pancreas but not in bone; therefore it can be useful in confirming that an elevated ALP is of liver and not bony origin.GGT is most commonly elevated as a result of obesity, excess alcohol consumption or may be induced by drugs. Although an elevated GGT has a low specificity for liver disease, it is one of the best predictors of liver mortality. It is particularly useful in children to establish the likelihood of biliary disease when ALP is not a reliable indicator. Predominant causes of cholestasis in children include congenital abnormalities of the biliary tract and genetic disorders affecting bile synthesis and excretion.

### Alkaline phosphatase treatment of acute kidney injury-an update [^d0e60d0c]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The endogenous enzyme ALP has an intricate connection with the host-response to systemic insults and with the preservation of natural barrier tissues. Despite promising in vivo results, clinical trials have yet to conclude if these effects translate to tangible improvement of patient health. Renewed insights into the interaction of exogenous ALP with TLRs and purinergic signalling, and its function in the protection of barrier tissues and the activity of endogenous ALP, can help guide new and ongoing trials.

### Medical treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis: what have we learned and where are we going? [^d974bc40]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

One study of newly diagnosed PSC individuals followed for 10 years revealed that 40% normalized their ALP during follow-up, while 60% had continuously elevated levels. Those with high ALP levels at diagnosis were more likely to reach clinical endpoints (CCA, liver transplantation, and death). In addition, they had more advanced PSC, as evidenced by higher fibrosis stages, Mayo risk scores, and bilirubin levels. An extended follow-up analysis of 198 participants from the Scandinavian UDCA trial revealed that responders — defined as individuals who achieved at least a 40% decrease in ALP levels or consistent normalization after one year — had better 10-year transplant-free survival compared to nonresponders. Interestingly, the most favorable outcomes were observed in individuals receiving a placebo and spontaneously normalized their ALP levels. Similar findings were reported in a UK PSC population, where an improvement in ALP to below 1.5× the upper limit of normal (ULN) was associated with better outcomes, comparable to those with complete ALP normalization.

In summary, there is an association between low, normalized, and improvement of ALP to levels below 1.5× ULN and a favorable outcome in PSC. However, whether medical treatment that leads to an improved ALP during a clinical trial period of up to two years reduces the risk of long-term clinical complications and future need for liver transplantation remains to be proven, and ALP should not, in isolation, be considered a valid surrogate endpoint in clinical trials in PSC.

Osteosarcoma — serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) as prognostic indicators — Elevated serum ALP and LDH levels have also been identified as prognostic indicators in patients with osteosarcoma. In a cohort of 1421 patients with osteosarcoma of the extremity, serum LDH was higher in those with metastatic presentation than with localized disease (36.6% vs. 18.8%; P < .0001), and 5-year DFS correlated with LDH (39.5% for high LDH and 60% for normal values). In another retrospective analysis of 789 patients with osteosarcoma of the extremity, serum ALP was a significant prognostic factor of EFS, with the 5-year EFS rate 24% for ALP more than four times the normal value and 46% for high values below this limit (P < .001). However, in multivariate analyses, these markers did not retain their prognostic significance when compared to tumor volume, age, and histologic response to chemotherapy.

### Tumour-derived alkaline phosphatase regulates tumour growth, epithelial plasticity and disease-free survival in metastatic prostate cancer [^2b031a6e]. British Journal of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men, with an estimated 1.1 million men diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2012 worldwide. Whereas localised prostate cancer has a good prognosis, advanced disease metastasises frequently to the skeleton, and becomes castration resistant. Once prostate cancer has metastasised to distant sites, the disease is ultimately fatal and treatment is purely palliative. The most common metastatic sites are the lymph nodes and the bone, with bone metastases resulting in severe bone pain and fractures. Despite many advances in research, a greater understanding of the metastatic process is required, to identify new therapeutic targets.

Recent evidence suggests that bone-related parameters are the main prognostic factors for overall survival in advanced prostate cancer. These include alkaline phosphatase, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, urinary n -telopepetide, previous skeletal-related events and pain. Alkaline phosphatase, also known as tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) or mesenchymal stem cell antigen 1, is an enzyme that is expressed by a range of tissues including bone, and also the liver. There are four existing isoforms of alkaline phosphatase, and the ALPL gene encodes for TNAP. Alkaline phosphatase is highly expressed by osteoblasts and a key component of osteoblastic activity, acting to hydrolyse inorganic pyrophosphate resulting in mineralisation. The bone lesions associated with prostate cancer are predominantly osteosclerotic, arising because of an increase in osteoblastic activity and uncontrolled formation of new bone. As such, the elevated circulating levels of alkaline phosphatase seen in advanced prostate cancer are thought to reflect the dysregulated bone formation associated with cancer-induced bone disease.

### Pharmacologic epigenetic modulators of alkaline phosphatase in chronic kidney disease [^b7618e6e]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Alkaline phosphatase in chronic kidney disease

In CKD, circulating ALP is commonly used in conjunction with parathyroid hormone for the approximation of bone turnover due to its association with bone formation. In the absence of liver disease, variations in total ALP typically arise from BALP, and can identify extremes of high and low bone turnover. Furthermore, circulating ALP is a better predictor of incident fractures in dialysis patients than bone mineral density. Circulating ALP is also a strong and independent predictor of mortality and cardiovascular complications in CKD. In non-CKD populations, the association between ALP and inflammation is predictive of mortality. In contrast, circulating BALP levels in patients with advanced CKD are an even stronger predictor of mortality than total ALP. This could be due to its association with the extensive vascular calcification arising in patients with CKD on dialysis. As all of the pathomechanisms discussed above are upregulated in CKD, the contribution of ALP to the increased CKD-related mortality, cardiovascular complications, and impaired cognition is presumably multifactorial.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease presenting with an isolated elevated alkaline phosphatase [^1a5a2edb]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Goals

To define a subset of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with isolated elevations in alkaline phophatase.

Background

NAFLD is a common referral to Gastroenterologists and Hepatologists. We have noted a subset of patients with biopsy proven NAFLD who present with an isolated elevation in alkaline phosphatase instead of the more typical aminotransferase elevations.

Study

A review of the liver biopsy database at Brooke Army Medical Center was performed with the key identifiers of "steatosis" and "steatohepatitis". Patients were separated into 2 groups depending on whether they presented with isolated elevated alkaline phosphatase (group 1), or more typical aminotransferase elevations (group 2). Multiple variables were analyzed to determine any significant differences between these groups.

Results

A total of 297 liver biopsies were evaluated. Of these, 135 biopsies were included in the study. Group 1 consisted of 14 patients and group 2 had 121 patients. Patients in group 1 were more likely to be older females (P < 0.05). Within group 1, those with steatohepatitis were older than those with steatosis (P < 0.05). When analyzed with regard to histopathology, patients with steatosis in group 1 were more likely female than group 2 patients (P = 0.03). Those with steatohepatitis in group 1 were older than group 2 patients (P = 0.001). Five of the 7 patients with steatohepatitis in group 1 had advanced liver disease at the time of biopsy.

Conclusions

Older female patients with isolated elevated alkaline phosphatase and risk factors for NAFLD should be evaluated for evidence of significant steatohepatitis.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^07afd332]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Breast cancer staging imaging — diagnostic CT or MRI is indicated if the patient has elevated alkaline phosphatase, abnormal results on LFTs, abdominal symptoms, or abnormal physical examination of the abdomen or pelvis. FDG-PET/CT may be performed at the same time as diagnostic CT and may be helpful in situations where standard staging studies are equivocal or suspicious, and may also be helpful in identifying unsuspected regional nodal disease and/or distant metastases when used in addition to standard staging studies. The routine use of FDG-PET/CT scanning is not recommended in the staging of clinical stage I, II, or operable III (T3, N1) breast cancer due to its high false-negative rate for the detection of lesions that are small (< 1 cm) and/or low-grade disease.

### Approach to hypophosphatemic rickets [^35754917]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Dosage is titrated based on laboratory testing, improvement in rickets and skeletal deformity on radiographs, and minimization of gastrointestinal and other side effects. Conventional therapy does not correct renal phosphate wasting, so, during treatment with calcitriol and phosphate, we do not target normal serum phosphorus due to safety concerns (nephrocalcinosis and hyperparathyroidism). Oral phosphate and calcitriol are administered multiple times a day due to short half-life and ongoing renal losses, limiting compliance.

Since the goal is for alkaline phosphatase and rickets to improve with treatment, it may be reasonable to increase doses of calcitriol or phosphate carefully to help reach this goal, unless the other safety laboratory assessments (normal to high serum phosphorus, high calcium, high PTH, or high urine calcium excretion) or other safety issues would prohibit that change. Recognize also that improvements in alkaline phosphatase takes time, and often alkaline phosphatase increases transiently on initiation of therapy for hypophosphatemic rickets or osteomalacia. Once stable dosing (of calcitriol and phosphate, or of burosumab) is established, monitoring is recommended about every 3 to 4 months for serum phosphorus, calcium, creatinine, and alkaline phosphatase, as well as urine calcium and creatinine. Importantly if the fasting serum phosphorus is low on treatment, that is not itself an indication to adjust phosphate salts or calcitriol.

Treating non-FGF23–mediated hypophosphatemia is more complex; hypercalciuria is often present. HHRH is treated with phosphate salts as monotherapy because of inherently elevated 1,25(OH) 2 D and hypercalciuria. When treating HHRH with phosphate salts, high 1,25(OH) 2 D may persist, though hypercalciuria can improve, while phosphaturia persists and hyperparathyroidism remains a risk. Similarly, patients with renal tubulopathies are at risk for hypercalciuria, limiting treatment with active vitamin D and requiring careful monitoring for hypercalciuria and progressive kidney disease. Targeted therapy for cystinosis is available as cysteamine.

### A diagnostic algorithm for children with low alkaline phosphatase activities: lessons learned from laboratory screening for Hypophosphatasia [^c45543eb]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To explore the role of laboratory screening for hypophosphatasia and propose a diagnostic pathway for children with low serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities.

Study Design

A retrospective hospital-based study over an 8-year period was conducted to identify children younger than 16 years of age with low ALP activity (< 100 U/L). Study-positive patients were contacted for repeat sampling, and those with persistently low ALP had plasma pyridoxal-5'-phosphate and urinary phosphoethanolamine measured.

Results

Of 323064 analyzed samples, 1526 had ALP activities < 100 U/L. Most patients had transient hypophosphatasemia. Of 50 patients with last-recorded ALP < 100 U/L, 32 were excluded given previous ALP > 100 U/L. Eighteen were identified as study-positive. Of the 15 surviving children, 13 were traceable. Four had persistently low ALP activity on retesting, of whom 2 had raised pyridoxal-5'-phosphate and phosphoethanolamine concentrations and were subsequently tested for ALPL gene mutations; a 4-year-old asymptomatic girl with a novel homozygous ALPL missense mutation and a 23-year-old female with a heterozygous mutation. There was significant overlap in ALP activities between study-positive and 11 current patients with hypophosphatasia. We propose a diagnostic algorithm for children with low ALP activities based on clinical and biochemical variables.

Conclusions

Patients with persistently low ALP activity require further clinical, biochemical, and radiological assessment for hypophosphatasia, even in the absence of clinical symptoms. The proposed diagnostic algorithm for children with low ALP will facilitate early detection of cases of hypophosphatasia, which, with the availability of enzyme replacement for hypophosphatasia, can be life-saving or avoid years of undiagnosed morbidity.

Primary biliary cholangitis diagnosis — guidance statements indicate that the diagnosis of PBC can be established when two of the following three criteria are met: biochemical evidence of cholestasis based on alkaline phosphatase (ALP) elevation; presence of antimitochondrial antibody (AMA) or other PBC-specific autoantibodies, including sp100 or gp210; or histologic evidence of nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis and destruction of interlobular bile ducts. Someone must have at least two features to be diagnosed with PBC, and liver biopsy to rule out concomitant autoimmune hepatitis or other liver disease should be considered in PBC patients when the alanine aminotransferase activity is more than five times the upper limit of normal.

### Introduction to the revised American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases position paper on acute liver failure 2011 [^d8b4ee53]. Hepatology (2012). Medium credibility.

Acute liver failure (ALF) diagnosis and initial evaluation — The diagnosis of ALF hinges on identifying that the patient has an acute insult and is encephalopathic, and imaging in recent years has suggested "cirrhosis", but this is often an overcall by radiology, because a regenerating massively necrotic liver will give the same nodular profile as cirrhosis. It is vital to promptly get viral hepatitis serologies, including A-E as well as autoimmune serologies. For fulminant Wilson's disease, diagnosis can be made most effectively by looking for bilirubin level (very high) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP; very low), such that the bilirubin/ALP ratio exceeds 2.0, noting that ceruloplasmin levels can be low in half of all ALF patients. The availability of an assay that measures acetaminophen adducts has improved our clinical recognition of acetaminophen cases when the diagnosis is obscured by patient denial or encephalopathy, and any patient with very high aminotransferases and low bilirubin on admission with ALF very likely has acetaminophen overdose, with the one possible exception being those patients who enter with ischemic injury. Obtaining autoantibodies should be routine and a low threshold for biopsy in patients with indeterminate ALF should be standard, given that autoimmune hepatitis may be the largest category of indeterminate, after unrecognized acetaminophen poisoning.

Biochemistry

Serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) at presentation (while sometimes modestly raised, and occasionally normal) are typically about 10 times higher than normal (sometimes even higher). Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) can be mildly raised in active disease, but marked elevation suggests primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) variant syndromes (Section N).

AIH presentation might vary between races. African-American patients are (compared with Caucasian patients) younger, with a higher prevalence of cirrhosis and liver failure. Non-Caucasian patients had more cholestatic histological features and a higher rate of non-response to treatment, not fully explained by differences in access to medical care.

Severity assessment

Although no unified severity classification exists for AIH, there are seven distinct patterns. These incorporate current understanding of acute and chronic liver disease and are determined by the severity of the acute (mild, icteric, severe, fulminant) and chronic (mild, fibrosis, and cirrhosis, compensated and decompensated) components of liver injury:

Asymptomatic disease: (a) mild or (b) with fibrosis/cirrhosis

Asymptomatic patients might not have mild disease. While they tend to have lower serum transaminases than symptomatic patients, severity of necro-inflammation and fibrosis are similar, as is death/transplantation rate. Treating asymptomatic patients is associated with improved survival (Section F).

Chronic hepatitis

This is the most common form of AIH, with insidious onset and non-specific symptoms.

Cirrhosis: (a) compensated and (b) decompensated

About one-third of patients with AIH have cirrhosis at diagnosis. Sometimes patients (usually elderly) present with cirrhosis complications. Cirrhosis and decompensation are poor prognostic features.

Acute hepatitis with or without jaundice

Initial severity of inflammation has prognostic implications. Patients with initial serum AST > 10 x ULN are less likely than those with values < 10 x ULN) to present with cirrhosis and/or decompensation, and to die due to (or need transplantation for) liver disease.

Acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF)

ACLF is acute injury developing in patients with (often unrecognised) cirrhosis, and sometimes with extrahepatic organ failure. In patients with AIH, a disease 'flare' might precipitate ACLF. Such patients might benefit from corticosteroids and most treated patients recover (Section F). However, in the UK, a label of ACLF is a potential mechanism to expedite liver transplant.

Treatment of increased metabolic activity in asymptomatic patients

Bisphosphonates are highly efficacious at reducing the elevations in bone turnover that are characteristic of active PDB. Here we focus on the effects of treatment on serum total ALP because it is the most commonly used biochemical marker of metabolic activity in PDB and has served as the primary outcome measure in clinical trials where bisphosphonates have been compared with placebo and with other bisphosphonates. In a Cochrane review, 66 it was noted that bisphosphonates achieved a 50.1% (95% CI 32.5–67.7) greater reduction in total ALP (592 participants) than placebo and the RR of bisphosphonates normalizing total ALP was 9.96 (95% CI 3.74–26.58). In the same review, a comparison of nitrogen‐containing bisphosphonates with non‐nitrogen‐containing bisphosphonates showed that nitrogen‐containing bisphosphonates were more effective at normalizing total ALP than non‐nitrogen‐containing bisphosphonates (212 participants) (RR = 4.3, 95% CI 2.72–6.79; NNT = 2, 95% CI 1–4). Within the nitrogen‐containing bisphosphonates, zoledronic acid was more efficacious at reducing total ALP than pamidronate (90 participants) or risedronate sodium (347 participants) (RR = 2.57, 95% CI 1.79–3.70; NNT = 2, 95% CI 1–3 and RR = 1.53, 95% CI 1.33–1.76; NNT = 3; 95% CI 3–5, respectively.

The duration of effect of different bisphosphonates on serum total ALP concentrations has also been studied. A randomized trial comparing oral risedronate sodium 30 mg daily for 2 months with oral etidronate 400 mg daily for 6 months showed that total ALP values remained suppressed in 53% of the risedronate sodium group compared with 14% of the etidronate group. 110 In a long‐term extension of the HORIZON Paget's study, (100) 88% of patients treated with a single dose of 5 mg zoledronic acid intravenously still had a normal serum total ALP after 5 years' follow‐up compared with 47% of patients treated with oral risedronate sodium. It should be noted that the attrition rate in this study was high and that only patients with normal ALP at the end of the core study were eligible to be enrolled into the extension.

### Osteomalacia with low alkaline phosphatase: a not so rare condition with important consequences [^9e1492a5]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Hypophosphatasia is a genetic disorder, characterised by a dysfunctional tissue-non-specific isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase that impacts bone metabolism and predisposes to osteomalacia or rickets. The clinical presentation is very diverse, depending on the age of onset and the severity of the disease. Several forms of hypophosphatasia are recognised. We present a case of a 50-year-old woman with low impact fractures and loss of teeth at a young age. She also had a low alkaline phosphatase and was diagnosed with adult hypophosphatasia. Although the severe forms of hypophosphatasia are rather rare, the adult form is thought to occur quite frequently. As this condition is not well known by healthcare professionals, the time to diagnosis and initiation of adequate treatment is often postponed. When encountering a patient with low alkaline phosphatase, low bone density or a history of bone fractures, the possibility of hypophosphatasia should be considered.

### Background… [^95fb0e36]. stacks.cdc.gov (2013). Low credibility.

Elevated total serum alkaline phosphatase levels have been associated with mortality in the general population and in dialysis patients. Retrospective cohort study. 28, 678 patients with chronic kidney disease stages 3 and 4 contributes to the development and progression of vascular calcification. However, we did sensitivity analyses fitting cox models with continuous ALP as described above and adjusting for proteinuria and serum phosphorus in separate analyses. We also did an additional sensitivity analysis that included only patients with ALP within the normal range.

All sensitivity analyses were also done on the 5 imputed datasets and the results combined using MIANALYZE. When the analysis was restricted to those who had ALP levels within the normal range, similar results were noted. In a subgroup analysis that included patients who had serum phosphorus data, we found that while adjusting for serum phosphorus, each 1-standard deviation higher ALP was associated with a 10% increased hazard for mortality, and a non-significant 9% increased risk for ESRD. Our study confirms the associations of ALP with mortality, and differs from the aforementioned studies because it samples a more diverse population, and reveals the independent associations between ALP and ESRD. 9 ALP is derived from various tissue origins, but is mostly concentrated in the liver, biliary ducts, bone, and placenta.

Tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase inactivates pyrophosphate, an endogenous inhibitor of hydroxyapatite formation, resulting in medial arterial vascular calcification. Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, an isoenzyme of ALP, is a more sensitive and specific marker for bone histology than intact PTH and ALP alone. High serum bALP is associated with fracture risk and mortality in CKD and hemodialysis patients.

CKD-MBD bone assessment and imaging in CKD stages 3–5D: KDIGO 2009 suggests that in patients with CKD stages 3–5D, measurements of serum PTH or bone-specific ALP can be used to evaluate bone disease because markedly high or low values predict underlying bone turnover, and states it is reasonable to perform bone biopsy in various settings and before therapy with bisphosphonates in patients with CKD-MBD. KDOQI 2003 noted bone-specific ALP not specifically recommended and that unexplained increases in bone ALP activity together with increases in PTH is indication for considering bone biopsy in CKD stage 5D; it also stated that bone biopsy should be considered in CKD stage 5D in various settings. For densitometry, KDIGO 2009 states that in CKD stages 3–5D with biochemical abnormalities of CKD-MBD, suggest that BMD testing not be routinely performed, whereas KDOQI 2003 stated DXA should be used in patients with fractures and those with known risks for osteoporosis.

### Alkaline phosphatase normalization is associated with better prognosis in primary sclerosing cholangitis [^124a0da6]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Primary sclerosing cholangitis results in elevated but fluctuating serum alkaline phosphatase levels that occasionally return to normal.

Aims

To investigate the frequency of normalization of alkaline phosphatase in newly diagnosed primary sclerosing cholangitis patients and the subsequent clinical outcomes.

Methods

Records of newly diagnosed primary sclerosing cholangitis patients were examined retrospectively for laboratory values and clinical end points (cholangiocarcinoma, liver transplantation and death) within 10 years of diagnosis. Data from a recent prospective ursodeoxycholic acid treatment trial were also studied.

Results

Eighty-seven patients met the inclusion criteria. Normalization of alkaline phosphatase was seen in 35 (40%) patients. Five (14%) patients with normalization reached an end point whereas 17 (33%) of the patients with persistent elevation reached an end point (P = 0.02). Ursodeoxycholic acid was used similarly by both groups. When the investigative criteria were applied to a prospective trial, there was again a significant relationship between normalization of alkaline phosphatase and survival in patients receiving ursodeoxycholic acid (P < 0.01) and the placebo group (P = 0.02).

Conclusions

Serum alkaline phosphatase was found to normalize in a high proportion of newly diagnosed primary sclerosing cholangitis patients. This was significantly associated with a better prognosis in a retrospective cohort and when data from a prospective treatment trial was evaluated.

ABSTRACT

An evidence‐based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of Paget's disease of bone (PDB) was developed using GRADE methodology, by a Guideline Development Group (GDG) led by the Paget's Association (UK). A systematic review of diagnostic tests and pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment options was conducted that sought to address several key questions of clinical relevance. Twelve recommendations and five conditional recommendations were made, but there was insufficient evidence to address eight of the questions posed. The following recommendations were identified as the most important: 1) Radionuclide bone scans, in addition to targeted radiographs, are recommended as a means of fully and accurately defining the extent of metabolically active disease in patients with PDB. 2) Serum total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is recommended as a first‐line biochemical screening test in combination with liver function tests in screening for the presence of metabolically active PDB. 3) Bisphosphonates are recommended for the treatment of bone pain associated with PDB. Zoledronic acid is recommended as the bisphosphonate most likely to give a favorable pain response. 4) Treatment aimed at improving symptoms is recommended over a treat‐to‐target strategy aimed at normalizing total ALP in PDB. 5) Total hip or knee replacements are recommended for patients with PDB who develop osteoarthritis in whom medical treatment is inadequate. There is insufficient information to recommend one type of surgical approach over another. The guideline was endorsed by the European Calcified Tissues Society, the International Osteoporosis Foundation, the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research, the Bone Research Society (UK), and the British Geriatric Society. The GDG noted that there had been a lack of research on patient‐focused clinical outcomes in PDB and identified several areas where further research was needed. © 2019 The Authors.

Adverse events

In the PRISM study, the numbers of adverse events and serious adverse events in the two treatment groups were similar. In the PRISM‐EZ study, the number of patients with adverse events in the intensive group was 226 of 270 (83.7%) compared with 196 of 232 (84.5%) in the symptomatic group (RR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.92–1.08). The number of serious adverse events in the two treatment groups was 87 of 270 (32.2%) versus 66 of 232 (28.4%) (RR = 1.28, 95% CI 0.96–1.72).

Alkaline phosphatase

In the PRISM study, serum concentrations of total ALP were significantly lower in the intensive group from 4 months onward. At the end of the study, 78.8% of the intensive group had a total ALP within the reference range compared with 61.2% of the symptomatic group (p < 0.001). In the PRISM‐EZ study, total ALP values were lower at baseline and throughout the study in the intensive group. By the end of the study, total ALP values were within the reference range in 85.3% of the intensive group versus 70.3% of the symptomatic group (p < 0.001).

The evidence summary and recommendations with regard to employing a strategy of supressing bone turnover as the primary therapeutic goal in PDB as opposed to treating symptoms are shown in Table 18.
