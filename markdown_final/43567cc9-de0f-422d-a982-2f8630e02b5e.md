## Question

Are there any hepatic contraindications taking ashwaganda

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ashwagandha has hepatic contraindications and how to interpret the evidence for patients with liver disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory status and whether any authoritative labeling lists a contraindication. Then, I should verify what randomized trials and observational studies say about liver safety signals. Next, I will check hepatology society guidance for how they frame herbal supplement risk. After that, I need to examine case reports and product-level signals that implicate ashwagandha. Finally, I will synthesize a risk stratification and monitoring approach tailored to different liver disease severities and provide a practical recommendation with caveats about product quality and interactions.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory baseline. Wait, let me verify whether any FDA labeling for ashwagandha lists a hepatic contraindication; I should double-check because I initially thought there might be a formal contraindication, but I need to ensure I'm not conflating this with other agents. I need to check the provided materials carefully. I do not see an FDA-labeled ashwagandha product with a hepatic contraindication in the supplied references, and the only explicit contraindication signals come from other drugs, not ashwagandha, so I should correct that assumption and proceed based on the evidence at hand rather than extrapolate from unrelated labels [^111xKghE] [^111DZZcE] [^113S4Vbm] [^1113vyFp].

> Next, I should review randomized trial data for direct liver safety signals. The Witholytin randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adults with stress and fatigue excluded participants with hepatic disease at baseline and monitored liver function tests at baseline and week 12. Importantly, there were no significant between-group differences in liver function over 12 weeks and no serious hepatic adverse events reported, which supports short-term tolerability in otherwise healthy adults, though this does not establish safety in those with pre-existing liver disease [^115PtLhB] [^112AEV2R] [^113PewRt] [^112kBsQs].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm how hepatology societies frame herbal supplement risk. The AASLD DILI guidance emphasizes that herbal and dietary supplements can cause severe hepatotoxicity with variable phenotypes, and that product quality issues, including mislabeling and adulteration, are common, which means absence of a labeled contraindication does not equal safety, especially in patients with liver disease or polypharmacy [^1173UGce] [^114mtraj]. I should also remember that DILI from supplements is a recognized entity in DILIN and other networks, reinforcing the need for caution and monitoring when hepatotoxic risk is plausible [^112ttXYD].

> I will now examine case-level and product-level signals that specifically mention ashwagandha. A case report describes drug-induced hepatitis in the setting of a complex naturopathic regimen where ashwagandha is noted with a LiverTox profile of "C", suggesting a probable association, although causality is complicated by polyherbal exposure and underscores the idiosyncratic nature of herbal DILI. This is a signal, not definitive proof, but it warrants vigilance [^113PfsLX]. Additionally, a recent case report of acute liver injury temporally linked to a hair-growth nutraceutical explicitly lists ashwagandha among potentially hepatotoxic components, with liver enzymes improving after discontinuation, which again raises concern for idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity in combination products and in susceptible hosts [^117RkaGs].

> Let me consider population exposure data to contextualize risk. A 2024 JAMA Network Open analysis identified ashwagandha among six potentially hepatotoxic botanicals, estimating that 4.7% of US adults report exposure, and noting that users are more likely to be older, female, and taking multiple supplements and prescription medications. This profile increases the chance of polypharmacy and additive hepatotoxic risk, which is clinically relevant even if ashwagandha alone is not invariably hepatotoxic [^111wkuMm] [^111ehRQj].

> Now, I should synthesize a risk stratification. For patients with normal liver function and no hepatic disease, short-term use of a standardized, single-ingredient ashwagandha product appears generally well tolerated in trials, though idiosyncratic reactions remain possible; I should confirm that patients disclose all supplements and monitor for new symptoms. For patients with compensated chronic liver disease, I need to ensure caution is exercised given idiosyncratic DILI risk and product variability; if used, prefer standardized products, avoid high doses and polyherbal combinations, and consider baseline and symptom-triggered liver tests. For patients with decompensated cirrhosis or acute liver failure, I should recommend avoidance given the limited safety margin and the potential for serious harm from even rare idiosyncratic injury, aligning with the general principle that hepatotoxic or hepatically metabolized agents are avoided in advanced liver disease unless benefits clearly outweigh risks [^115iGRxv] [^116mha4i] [^111oj74f].

> Wait, I should verify practical monitoring guidance. I need to ensure that if ashwagandha is used in someone with liver disease risk factors, we apply DILI surveillance principles: obtain baseline AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin, albumin, and INR; educate patients to report jaundice, dark urine, pruritus, fatigue, or abdominal pain promptly; and repeat liver tests if symptoms occur or after about 3 months of use, recognizing that early detection improves outcomes and that rechallenge after suspected DILI is generally discouraged unless the benefit is compelling [^113s1NHW] [^1118JCCR] [^115XC8yR].

> But wait, what if the product is a multi-ingredient formula. I should double-check that many reported injuries involve combination products where attribution is complex. Given frequent mislabeling and variability in botanical content, choosing a single-ingredient, standardized extract and avoiding concurrent high-risk hepatotoxins like kava, green tea extract, or Garcinia cambogia reduces uncertainty, though it does not eliminate idiosyncratic risk [^1173UGce] [^112ttXYD].

> Final synthesis: I should confirm the bottom line. There is no FDA-listed hepatic contraindication for ashwagandha in the provided materials, and short-term randomized data in healthy adults show no liver signal, but hepatology guidance and case reports support a risk-based approach rather than blanket safety. Therefore, ashwagandha should be avoided in decompensated cirrhosis or acute liver failure, used with caution and monitoring in compensated liver disease, and considered acceptable with routine supplement precautions in otherwise healthy adults, with explicit counseling on symptoms, product selection, and interactions [^113PewRt] [^1173UGce] [^113PfsLX] [^117RkaGs].

---

Ashwagandha is not absolutely contraindicated in liver disease, but it should be **avoided or used with caution** in patients with pre-existing liver conditions, especially advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, due to rare but serious hepatotoxicity reported in case series and pharmacovigilance data [^1174rRHR] [^113PfsLX]. Clinical trials in healthy adults show no consistent liver enzyme elevations at standard doses, but patients with liver disease were excluded, so safety in this population remains uncertain [^113PewRt] [^115PtLhB]. If used, monitor liver enzymes and discontinue if ALT/AST rise or symptoms occur; **avoid in severe hepatic impairment** or decompensated cirrhosis.

---

## Evidence of hepatotoxicity

- **Case reports**: Rare cases of acute liver injury, including hepatocellular and cholestatic patterns, have been reported with ashwagandha-containing products, some requiring hospitalization or leading to hepatic failure [^111nkGQa] [^117RkaGs].

- **Pharmacovigilance data**: Ashwagandha is among botanicals with potential hepatotoxicity in US surveillance, with idiosyncratic injury patterns [^111wkuMm].

- **Mechanisms**: Proposed mechanisms include mitochondrial injury, oxidative stress, and immune-mediated injury, consistent with idiosyncratic DILI [^111nkGQa].

---

## Clinical trial evidence

In clinical trials, **RCTs in healthy adults** show no consistent liver enzyme elevations with standard doses (e.g. 300–600 mg/day) over 8–12 weeks, but patients with liver disease were excluded, limiting generalizability [^113PewRt] [^115PtLhB]. Limitations include the lack of hepatic impairment subgroups and limited duration, leaving long-term safety in liver disease uncertain.

---

## Expert guidelines and recommendations

Expert guidance emphasizes that **AASLD guidance** notes herbal and dietary supplements can cause severe hepatotoxicity; use caution and monitor liver enzymes when hepatotoxicity risk is possible [^1173UGce]. Transplant considerations advise that ashwagandha has idiosyncratic hepatotoxic potential and may complicate transplant courses; weigh risks and benefits carefully [^1174rRHR].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing risk

Patient-specific factors that influence risk include **pre-existing liver disease**, which increases susceptibility to idiosyncratic DILI; dose and duration also matter, as higher doses and prolonged use may elevate risk. Concurrent hepatotoxic drugs or supplements further increase risk via additive effects [^112kBkan].

---

## Recommended precautions and monitoring

- **Baseline labs**: Obtain AST, ALT, ALP, and bilirubin before starting ashwagandha.

- **Monitoring**: Recheck liver enzymes within 4–8 weeks of initiation and periodically thereafter.

- **Discontinuation**: Stop if ALT/AST rise > 3× ULN, bilirubin > 2× ULN, or symptoms (jaundice, fatigue, abdominal pain) occur.

- **Avoidance**: Avoid in severe hepatic impairment, decompensated cirrhosis, or acute liver failure.

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Liver disease severity** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Normal liver function | Safe at standard doses; monitor if prolonged use or high doses |
| Mild chronic liver disease | Use with caution; monitor liver enzymes |
| Moderate liver disease | Use only if benefits outweigh risks; close monitoring |
| Severe liver disease or decompensated cirrhosis | Avoid use |

---

Ashwagandha is not absolutely contraindicated in liver disease, but **use caution in patients with liver disease** due to rare hepatotoxicity. Avoid in severe hepatic impairment; if used, monitor liver enzymes and discontinue if abnormalities or symptoms occur.

Patient Management

Routinely monitor patients for progression of PBC, including hepatic adverse reactions, with laboratory and clinical assessments to determine whether drug discontinuation is needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Closely monitor patients with compensated cirrhosis, concomitant hepatic disease (e.g., autoimmune hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease), and/or with severe intercurrent illness for new evidence of portal hypertension (e.g., ascites, gastroesophageal varices, persistent thrombocytopenia) or increases above the upper limit of normal in total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, or prothrombin time to determine whether drug discontinuation is needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Permanently discontinue OCALIVA in patients who:

develop laboratory or clinical evidence of hepatic decompensation (e.g., ascites, jaundice, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy) [see Contraindications (4)].
have compensated cirrhosis and develop evidence of portal hypertension (e.g., ascites, gastroesophageal varices, persistent thrombocytopenia) [see Contraindications (4)].
experience clinically significant hepatic adverse reactions.
develop complete biliary obstruction [see Contraindications (4)].

If severe intercurrent illness occurs, interrupt treatment with OCALIVA and monitor the patient's liver function. After resolution of the intercurrent illness, consider the potential risks and benefits of restarting OCALIVA treatment.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^112kBkan]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) risk determinants — drug properties: Although idiosyncratic DILI typically is independent of administered dose, risk factors are given at a daily dose of > 50–100 mg per day. More than 80% of DILI cases that resulted in liver transplantation in the United States were caused by medications with daily doses exceeding 50 mg. Drugs with high lipophilicity and extensive metabolism in the liver (> 50%) are associated with an increased hepatotoxic potential, especially in combination with a high daily dose (> 100 mg daily). Concomitant administration of multiple hepatotoxic drugs and dose escalation as seen with azathioprine have been associated with increased risk, whereas dose reduction or increasing the dosing interval may improve tolerability.

### Herbal drugs in liver disease: how safe are they? [^111dFQnH]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

A 24-year-old man presented with jaundice to our center and further evaluation revealed the presence of acute hepatitis E infection, an infection common in India. The patient's parents consulted a traditional medicine practitioner for giving him native medications for jaundice, a practice very common in India. After taking native medications for 5 days, he developed fulminant liver failure and was readmitted to our center and, in spite of resuscitative and supportive measures, he succumbed to his illness. This clinical situation epitomizes the challenge that we physicians in India face when we confront a patient with liver disease, wherein we have to balance the application of scientific knowledge and the use of native medications by patients. Herbal medicines have been in vogue right from the Vedic period in India at around 600 BC and continue to be used even now for various forms of diseases, particularly affecting the liver. This study aims to highlight this issue and its implications for the treating physicians and the public.

### Exploring the efficacy and safety of a novel standardized ashwagandha () root extract (witholytin ®) in adults experiencing high stress and fatigue in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^117SJ3qM]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite no significant difference between the groups in the change of PSS scores (primary outcome), there was a statistically significant between-group difference in change in HRV over time. However, this finding needs to be tentatively considered since there was a statistically significant 18.8% reduction in HRV in the placebo group, and only a non-significant increased trend of 9.1% in the ashwagandha group. HRV is the measurement of time between successive beats of the heart and provides a measure of the interplay between the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems. HRV is inversely associated with cortisol concentrations and is positively correlated with low testosterone concentrations in men. The between-group differences in HRV suggest that ashwagandha supplementation was associated with increased parasympathetic activity, which is typically associated with reduced stress levels. However, this physiological change from ashwagandha supplementation did not lead to reduced self-reported perceived stress as measured by the PSS. A reason for this contrasting finding may be because the change in HRV was not of significant magnitude to result in noticeable reductions in perceived stress for individuals. Moreover, differences in testing protocols may account for these divergent findings as the PSS is based on self-reports of stress-related changes over the previous 4 weeks, and in this study, HRV was a physiological single-point, 5-min measure. It has been reported that ashwagandha has HPA axis-modulating effects so further investigations into the effects of ashwagandha on HRV may be useful. Interestingly, in this study, a post-hoc exploratory analysis did not reveal any significant relationship between changes in HRV and other outcome measures collected in this study.

### Vanzacaftor, tezacaftor, and deutivacaftor (Alyftrek) [^111HkJE4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Boxed warning regarding the use of vanzacaftor / tezacaftor / deutivacaftor PO (also known as Alyftrek) and drug-induced liver injury, ALF: maintain a high level of suspicion, as vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor has been associated with an increased risk of elevated serum transaminase levels, drug-induced liver injury, and liver failure. Assess LFTs at baseline and every month during the first 6 months of treatment, every 3 months for the next 12 months, and at least annually thereafter. Consider obtaining more frequent monitoring in patients with a history of liver disease, elevated LFTs at baseline, or a history of elevated LFTs with drugs containing elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and/or ivacaftor. Interrupt vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor for significant elevations in LFTs or when signs or symptoms of liver injury develop. Do not use vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). Vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor is not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) and should only be used when there is a clear medical need, and the benefit outweighs the risk.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^113sT2zS]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Statins

There are seven 3‐hydroxy‐3‐methyl‐glutaryl‐coenzyme A reductase inhibitors or "statin" drugs that are used on a daily basis by millions of patients with hyperlipidemia. In general, statins are safe to administer, but myalgias and myopathy may lead to early dose reduction or termination in up to 10% of treated patients. Early on there was concern of self‐limited serum aminotransferase elevations in up to 20% of patient receiving statins, but clinically significant hepatic dysfunction was very uncommon. In the DILIN study, only 22 of 1188 (1.8%) consecutively enrolled patients with DILI were attributed to a statin over an 8‐year period. Both acute cholestatic and hepatocellular injury were observed, as well as fewer patients with autoimmune features. Several randomized controlled trials have demonstrated no significant increase in the incidence of persistently elevated serum aminotransferase levels between statin and placebo therapy, including in patients with known chronic liver disease.–In addition, other studies have suggested that statins in patients with compensated chronic liver disease and cirrhosis may even reduce the risk of hepatocellular cancer and decompensation. In 2012, the FDA altered the product labels of available statins so that baseline liver biochemistries be obtained but that on‐treatment liver biochemistry monitoring is not required unless clinically indicated. Therefore, we do not recommend checking liver biochemistries in patients receiving statins unless there are new or unexplained symptoms of hepatitis. However, statins should be avoided in patients with decompensated cirrhosis due to their hepatic metabolism, but low doses can be considered on an individual basis after assessing overall risk versus benefit.

### Garcinia cambogia, either alone or in combination with green tea, causes moderate to severe liver injury [^111nkGQa]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Garcinia cambogia, either alone or with green tea, is commonly promoted for weight loss. Sporadic cases of liver failure from G cambogia have been reported, but its role in liver injury is controversial.

Methods

Among 1418 patients enrolled in the Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) from 2004 to 2018, we identified 22 cases (adjudicated with high confidence) of liver injury from G cambogia either alone (n = 5) or in combination with green tea (n = 16) or Ashwagandha (n = 1). Control groups consisted of 57 patients with liver injury from herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) containing green tea without G cambogia and 103 patients from other HDS.

Results

Patients who took G cambogia were between 17 and 54 years, with liver injury arising 13–223 days (median = 51) after the start. One patient died, one required liver transplantation, and 91% were hospitalized. The liver injury was hepatocellular with jaundice. Although the peak values of aminotransferases were significantly higher (2001 ± 1386 U/L) in G cambogia group (P < .018), the median time for improvement in total bilirubin was significantly lower compared with the control groups (10 vs 17 and 13 days; p = 0.03). The presence of HLA-B✱35:01 allele was significantly higher in the G cambogia containing HDS (55%) compared with patients because of other HDS (19%) (P = .002) and those with acute liver injury from conventional drugs (12%) (P = 2.55 × 10–6).

Conclusions

The liver injury caused by G cambogia and green tea is clinically indistinguishable. The possible association with HLA-B✱35:01 allele suggests an immune-mediated mechanism of injury.

### Interactions between antidiabetic drugs and herbs: an overview of mechanisms of action and clinical implications [^116NDZH9]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2017). Low credibility.

General discussions and conclusion

Based on the results presented above, it is clear that numerous herbal medicines, when taken in conjunction with antidiabetic pharmaceutical agents, could potentially alter their pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic properties. These interactions are complex given the large number of pathophysiological/pharmacological targets associated with the disease and the multicomponent properties of herbal medicine. The batch-to-batch variation in chemical composition of herbal medicine is also likely to impact on the nature of the interactions, making them unpredictable (Table 1).

Table 1
Herb–antidiabetic drug co-administration studies

In this review we have found that interactions of antidiabetic drugs and herbs may result in antagonistic or enhancement effects. The enhancement of glucose lowering has the possibility of causing hypoglycaemia, hence monitoring of potentially adverse effects is required and hence it is recommended that people with diabetes closely monitor their blood glucose levels when combining the two compounds. Although the vast majority of available evidence suggests that herbal medicines are relatively safe one case report showed that a patient with T2DM who was treated with the combination of Metformin and Repaglinide experienced hypoglycaemia, suggesting that patients and clinicians should indeed be alert to this possibility. Further research is required to examine the potential for hypoglycaemia in patients who are concurrently administered antidiabetic drugs.

Despite the potential for adverse effects, the combination of these herbs and antidiabetic medications has been more commonly shown to have positive clinical implications as it could lead to enhanced antidiabetic effects, potentially enabling a reduction in dose of antidiabetic agents, thereby minimising their side effects. In contrast, antagonism may lead to harmful effects and therefore warrant a cautionary warning or contraindication for the combination. Although not discussed in this review, antidiabetic herbs may also interact with other (non-diabetic) medicines when taken concurrently. These considerations indicate that caution should always be exercised when herbal medicines are combined with pharmaceutical medicines, especially in elderly patients or patients with chronic illnesses due to their compromised body functions (e.g. renal and hepatic functions in particular). Further research is warranted on the mechanisms of action underlying antidiabetic herb–drug interactions. CYP monoxygenase and P-glycoprotein drug transport pathways are of particular interest given that many antidiabetic medications are subject to metabolism by these enzyme systems.

### Evidence based herbal drug standardization approach in coping with challenges of holistic management of diabetes: a dreadful lifestyle disorder of 21st century [^116YDVkB]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Contraindications of herbal alternatives

Herbal drugs are prescribed widely because of their effectiveness, less side effects, broad range of action and relatively low cost. However, the non trial drugs are usually not evaluated for purity and consistency of active compounds; they often contain contaminants and might show batch-to-batch variations. The exact mechanism of action in lowering blood sugar is often not known. In addition, these herbs may not work well for everyone and their overall effect may vary in individuals, due to lack of standardization. Side effects can also be patient specific and a combination of these herbs may be required to obtain the desired effect which leads to the development of pre-clinical trials for poly-herbal formulations. The various shortcomings/contraindications of herbal medicines includes: a) Being self prescribed, quality assurance is not guaranteed and also may interact with other drugs, b) contraindications of herbal drugs and associated unusual beliefs, c) contain powerful, pharmacologically active compounds that needs to be evaluated for drug-drug interactions, d) usually cause hepatic and renal problems if taken in excess; due to lack of pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics data and slow clearance rate from the body, e) difficulty in identification of the causative agent associated with the adverse reactions encountered as these often contain multiple ingredients, f) lack of standardization while the formulation of herbal drug i.e. delivery system for particular target is generally not validated, g) mode of action of herbal plant constituents is not clear enough to support therapeutic utility.

### Obeticholic acid (Ocaliva) [^113bzPKa]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

Prior to the initiation of OCALIVA, healthcare providers should determine whether the patient has decompensated cirrhosis (e.g. Child-Pugh Class B or C), has had a prior decompensation event, or has compensated cirrhosis with evidence of portal hypertension (e.g., ascites, gastroesophageal varices, persistent thrombocytopenia) because OCALIVA is contraindicated in these patients [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

2.2	Recommended Dosage Regimen

The recommended dosage of OCALIVA for PBC patients without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis who do not have evidence of portal hypertension, who have not achieved an adequate biochemical response to an appropriate dosage of UDCA for at least 1 year or are intolerant to UDCA [see Clinical Studies (14)] follows below:

Start with a dosage of 5 mg once daily for the first 3 months.
After the first 3 months, for patients who have not achieved an adequate reduction in ALP and/or total bilirubin and who are tolerating OCALIVA, increase to a maximum dosage of 10 mg once daily.

2.3 Monitoring to Assess Safety, Need for OCALIVA Discontinuation

Routinely monitor patients during OCALIVA treatment for biochemical response, tolerability, and progression of PBC. Closely monitor patients with compensated cirrhosis, concomitant hepatic disease (e.g., autoimmune hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease), and/or severe intercurrent illness for new evidence of portal hypertension (e.g., ascites, gastroesophageal varices, persistent thrombocytopenia) or increases above the upper limit of normal in total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, or prothrombin time. Permanently discontinue OCALIVA in patients who develop laboratory or clinical evidence of hepatic decompensation, have compensated cirrhosis and develop evidence of portal hypertension, experience clinically significant hepatic adverse reactions, or develop complete biliary obstruction [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Zaleplon (Sonata) [^112xyNVF]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The dose of Sonata should be individualized. The recommended dose
of Sonata for most nonelderly adults is 10 mg. For certain low weight
individuals, 5 mg may be a sufficient dose. Although the risk of certain adverse
events associated with the use of Sonata appears to be dose dependent, the 20 mg
dose has been shown to be adequately tolerated and may be considered for the
occasional patient who does not benefit from a trial of a lower dose. Doses
above 20 mg have not been adequately evaluated and are not recommended.

Sonata should be taken immediately before bedtime or after the patient has
gone to bed and has experienced difficulty falling asleep (see PRECAUTIONS.). Taking Sonata with or
immediately after a heavy, high-fat meal results in slower absorption and would
be expected to reduce the effect of Sonata on sleep latency (see Pharmacokinetics under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

Special Populations

Elderly patients and debilitated patients appear to be more
sensitive to the effects of hypnotics, and respond to 5 mg of Sonata. The
recommended dose for these patients is therefore 5 mg. Doses over 10 mg are not
recommended.

Hepatic insufficiency: Patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment
should be treated with Sonata 5 mg because clearance is reduced in this
population. Sonata is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic
impairment.

Renal insufficiency: No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to
moderate renal impairment. Sonata has not been adequately studied in patients
with severe renal impairment.

An initial dose of 5 mg should be given to patients concomitantly taking
cimetidine because zaleplon clearance is reduced in this population (see Drug Interactions under PRECAUTIONS).

Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose — diagnosis and initial laboratory assessment is based on a history of ingestion of excessive doses (usually > 4 g as a single time point) with towering transaminase levels (often > 1000 IU/L) within the first 24 h of observation, and measurement of a serum APAP level after a single-time-point ingestion can help identify patients at greatest risk of developing liver injury.

Participants

Interested volunteers, evaluated as likely eligible, were contacted via telephone for further assessment of their eligibility and to obtain demographic details. Participants meeting the eligibility criteria were then required to complete an online informed consent form and to have a sample of their non-fasted blood collected from a local pathology collection center. This blood sample was used to measure glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C), liver function, full blood count (FBC), renal function, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Participants with results significantly outside the reference ranges were ineligible to participate in the study. Participant eligibility criteria are outlined below:

Inclusion criteria

Healthy males and females aged between 40 and 75 years; experiencing low energy; fatigue, based on a score of 9 or more on the PROMIS-29 fatigue subscale score; and moderate-to-high stress, based on a score of 14 or higher on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (primary outcome); a non-smoker; with a body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 35 kg/m 2; reporting no plan to change their diet or start new treatments during the study period, and willing to comply with all study procedures.

### Estimated exposure to 6 potentially hepatotoxic botanicals in US adults [^111ehRQj]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Characteristics of the 6 potentially hepatotoxic botanical users (n = 350) were compared with those with no HDS use (n = 4414) (Table 2). At-risk botanical users were significantly older (mean [SE] age, 51.7 [2.0] vs 41.5 [0.4] years; P < .001) and more likely to be female (56.9% [95% CI, 47.7%-65.5%] vs 43.7% [95% CI, 42.5%-45.0%]; p = 0.005), non-Hispanic White (75.2% [95% CI, 65.4%-82.9%] vs 54.8% [95% CI, 49.1%-60.3%]; P < .001), married (66% [95% CI, 58.5%-72.7%] vs 59.0% [95% CI, 57.0%-60.9%]; p = 0.001), and have some college degree or higher (82.8% [95% CI, 76.7%-87.5%] vs 52.6% [95% CI, 50.9%-59.2%]; P < .001), and were less likely to be below the poverty line (5.1% [95% CI, 3.0%-8.8%] vs 18.3% [95% CI, 16.0%-20.7%]; P < .001). Among at-risk botanical users, the median number of HDS products used was 4 (range, 2–7) and was highest among those who consumed red yeast rice and ashwagandha (median [IQR], 7 [4–11]). Individuals who used at least 1 the 6 botanicals of interest were also more likely to be taking a prescription medication compared with non–HDS users (66.0% [95% CI, 58.9%-71.8%] vs 42.0% [95% CI, 39.5%-44.9%]; P < .001). Furthermore, the botanical users were more likely to have arthritis (40.0% [95% CI, 32.4%-48.1%] vs 19.5% [95% CI, 17.7%-21.4%]; P < .001), thyroid disorder (15.8% [95% CI, 11.0%-22.1%] vs 6.8% [95% CI, 5.6%-8.1%]; p = 0.004), and cancer (14.0% [95% CI, 9.7%-19.6%] vs 6.8% [95% CI, 5.6%-8.3%]; p = 0.006) compared with non–HDS users.

### Complementary and alternative medicine in hepatology: review of the evidence of efficacy [^115iGRxv]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

There is an increase in the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), especially herbal therapy, among patients with liver disease. The most commonly used herbal agent is silymarin. In animal models, many of the commonly used agents have shown anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects. Although many human studies have shown improvements in subjective symptoms (well being) and liver biochemistry, there are no convincing data to suggest a definite histologic and/or virologic improvement with most of these agents. Poorly designed studies, heterogeneous patient populations, lack of standardized preparations, and poorly defined nonobjective end points may partly explain the conflicting reports in the literature. Hepatotoxicity and drug interactions are common with many herbal medications, and therefore physicians need to be cognizant of known or occult use of CAM by their patients. Only well-designed, randomized, controlled trials will be able to ascertain whether CAM has any role in the management of patients with acute or chronic liver diseases. Until such time, the use of CAM cannot be recommended as a therapy for patients with liver disease.

Self-reported adverse reactions and safety measures

As detailed in Table 7, no serious adverse reactions were reported by participants, and a similar frequency of adverse reactions was reported in both groups. Three participants withdrew from the study due to low or moderate severity of self-reported adverse reactions believed to be associated with capsule intake. In the ashwagandha group, one participant withdrew due to self-reported ankle pain and one due to reduced mood/tiredness. In the placebo group, one participant withdrew due to self-reported skin itchiness/rashes. There were no reports of any adverse reactions in 78% of participants in the ashwagandha group and 75% in the placebo group. An analysis of changes in blood safety measures from baseline to week 12 demonstrated there were no statistically significant between-group differences in changes in liver function, renal function, or complete blood count over time. For both men and women, there were no statistically significant time × group interactions in BMI, WC, and WHR, based on the GLMM.

### Ashwagandha root in the treatment of non-classical adrenal hyperplasia [^111A7u18]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a well-characterised family of disorders of the adrenal cortices, resulting in varying degrees of cortisol, aldosterone and androgen deficiency or androgen excess, depending on the enzyme(s) affected and the degree of quantitative or functional enzyme deficit. Withania somnifera (WS), commonly known as Ashwagandha, is a medicinal plant that has been employed for centuries in ayurvedic medicine. Preclinical studies have shown that WS increases circulating cortisol levels and improves insulin sensitivity. We report the case of a 57-year-old woman with non-classical adrenal hyperplasia due to both 3-β-ol dehydrogenase deficiency and aldosterone synthase deficiency who was self-treated with WS for 6 months. After 6 months of treatment her serum 18-OH-hydroxycorticoserone, 17-OH-pregnenolone, corticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol decreased by 31%, 66%, 69% and 55%, respectively. The biochemical improvement was accompanied by a noticeable reduction in scalp hair loss.

In women, there was no statistically significant between-group difference in estradiol concentrations; however, the ashwagandha group did experience a significant 59% increase in estradiol concentrations from baseline to week 12. Even though the sample sizes were too small to formulate robust conclusions, an exploratory analysis of changes in estradiol concentrations in perimenopausal women taking ashwagandha (n = 10) revealed an increase of 137% in estradiol concentrations from baseline to week 12, compared to a smaller 26% increase in post-menopausal women (n = 14). In contrast, in the placebo group, estradiol concentrations increased by 6% in perimenopausal women (n = 12) and reduced by 14% in post-menopausal women (n = 16). However, it is important to note that despite an increase in estradiol in the ashwagandha group, concentrations continued to remain within normal ranges. Further research on the effects of ashwagandha on sex hormone concentrations in women of varying ages and menstrual status requires further investigation. In a randomized controlled trial on perimenopausal women, ashwagandha supplementation for 8 weeks increased estradiol concentrations by approximately 40%. However, there has been no study conducted on post-menopausal women. It has been proposed that ashwagandha may increase estradiol via its GABA mimetic activity, which may stimulate LH secretion from the pituitary gland. Moreover, ashwagandha has demonstrated HPA axis-modulating effects, and since cortisol is inversely associated with sex hormones in both men and women, it is plausible that ashwagandha may have contributed to the increase in estradiol via this mechanism as well.

The significant increase in LH in men in the ashwagandha group compared to the placebo group is unexpected as there is generally a negative feedback relationship between FT and LH. However, as FT concentrations throughout the study remained within normal ranges (albeit low normal ranges), the magnitude of the increase in FT may not have triggered the negative feedback system. Moreover, aging is purported to impair the negative feedback of testosterone on the hypothalamus, hence the elevated LH concentrations of both groups of men (ashwagandha and placebo) throughout the duration of the study, but this theory requires further elucidation. Additionally, in vitro research demonstrated ashwagandha's ability to upregulate gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) expression in hypothalamic cells, providing another potential mechanism for the concurrent elevated concentrations of FT and LH in the ashwagandha group.

Introduction

Herbal drugs have been used since the inception of human beings on this planet and as a result is almost as old as life itself. In the modern world, the traditional (herbal) medicines assumed a significant proportion of > 83 billion dollars annual production (2008), increasing exponentially. In developing countries, 70–95% of the population relies on herbal medicines for primary care mainly due to cost imperatives or unavailability of conventional drugs. In India, in spite of over 80% of the population dependent upon herbal drugs; it occupies less than 2.5% of the global market share. On the other hand, > 60% market share is being controlled by European Union and North America while 16% being shared by Japan and rest 19% by ASEAN countries.

Herbal medicines, containing active ingredients in complex chemical mixtures developed as crude fractions, extracted from aerial or underground parts of plant or other plant material or combination thereof, are widely used in health-care or as dietary supplements. One of the major drawbacks of these medicines is limited bioavailability, being poorly absorbed if taken orally. According to an estimate of the World Health Organization (WHO), about 80% of the world population still uses herbs and other traditional medicines for fulfilling their primary health care needs. It is essential to understand that its effectiveness may vary and it might interact with other drugs leading to contraindications. Safety considerations regarding toxicological analysis, pre-clinical and clinical trials are essential prior to adoption of any herbal medicine. At present, herbal formulations have reached widespread acceptability as therapeutic agents for diabetics, arthritics, liver diseases, cough remedies, memory enhancers and adoptogens. In spite of such wide acceptability, the number of standardized herbal drugs is less due to lack of regulatory standards and implementation protocols.

Antimicrobials, central nervous system agents, and anti-inflammatory agents are the most commonly implicated agents worldwide, with HDS most commonly implicated in some Asian countries and increasingly in Western countries. The daily dose of a medication, its lipophilicity, and extent of hepatic metabolism influence comparative DILI risk between medications.

### Exploring the efficacy and safety of a novel standardized ashwagandha () root extract (witholytin ®) in adults experiencing high stress and fatigue in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1146gewD]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

A significant reduction in fatigue symptoms in the ashwagandha group compared to the placebo group, as measured by the CFS, was identified in the present study. The positive result from the CFS is supported by a meta-analysis examining the effects of ashwagandha on physical performance, which included fatigue symptoms. The results of the review from 13 studies and 615 adults concluded that the pooled effect of ashwagandha administration was large (effect size of 1.18) and that future studies demonstrating positive effects in terms of fatigue reduction were likely to be meaningful. It could be theorized that the decrease in fatigue symptoms may result from increases in sex hormones in both men (FT) and women (estradiol) since research indicates that a relationship may exist between sex hormone concentrations and fatigue. However, an exploratory analysis revealed that changes in these sex hormones were not significantly correlated with changes in the CFS score. This suggests that other mechanisms associated with reduced fatigue levels may be at play. These mechanisms require investigation in future trials and could be due to their influence on the HPA axis, antioxidant activity, and/or anti-inflammatory effects.

Despite ashwagandha being associated with increases in FT and estradiol concentrations over time in men and women, respectively, concentrations in these sex hormones remained within normal ranges. It is important to note that in men, estradiol concentrations increased by 28% and 29% in the ashwagandha and placebo groups, respectively. Despite these similar changes, at week 12, estradiol concentrations in men taking ashwagandha were slightly above normal ranges. Similar increases in estradiol occurred in both the placebo and ashwagandha groups, with baseline estradiol concentrations being slightly higher in the ashwagandha group. Moreover, since BMI and obesity in men are associated with increased estradiol concentrations and aromatase activity, these changes are considered not clinically meaningful. However, this observation should be monitored in further studies on ashwagandha, as plant ingredients have been shown in some trials to have estrogenic effects in males.

Discussion

In this 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial on overweight or mildly obese men and women aged 40–75 years, supplementing with 200 mg of an ashwagandha root extract (Witholytin®) twice daily was associated with a significant reduction in their stress levels based on the PSS (primary outcome measure); however, the improvements were not significantly different to participants taking a placebo. Based on the CFS, there was a significant reduction in self-reported fatigue symptoms in the ashwagandha group compared to the placebo group, and participants taking ashwagandha also experienced a significant increase in HRV, as measured by RMSSD, compared to the placebo group. However, there were no significant between-group differences in other self-report outcome measures. In the men taking ashwagandha, there was a significant increase in the blood concentrations of FT and LH compared to the placebo group, and a trend suggesting a greater increase in MDA concentrations. Moreover, there was a trend of a greater increase in estradiol concentrations in women taking ashwagandha. However, there were no significant between-group differences in changes in DHEA-S, TT, HbA1c, fasting glucose, and grip strength. Ashwagandha intake was well-tolerated, with both groups experiencing a similar number of self-reported adverse effects. Further evidence of the safety of ashwagandha supplementation over 12 weeks is demonstrated by findings of no significant changes in blood safety measures comprising full blood count, liver function, and renal function, and anthropometric measurements comprising BMI, waist and hip circumference.

### When is a herb a drug? [^115psMWy]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

With the growing popularity and use of herbal remedies in the industrial countries there has been an increasing recognition and reporting of adverse reactions. Drug development represents discovery and characterization of naturally occurring plant metabolites or their synthetic analogues. Therefore, a herbal remedy should be considered a drug for all clinical purposes. The liver, being central to the metabolism of virtually all xenobiotics, is inevitably exposed to reactive metabolites and liver injury is a potential complication of nearly every medication, including herbal remedies. Recognition of herb induced hepatotoxicity depends on clinical awareness of the problem, a suspicion that a herbal preparation is involved, and detailed enquiry regarding the use of all supplements and remedies. Herbal medicines should be regulated more systematically and monitoring for adverse reaction should improve.

Conclusion

In conclusion, supplementing with 200 mg of an ashwagandha extract (Witholytin®) twice daily for 12 weeks, in overweight or mildly obese men and women, aged 40–75 years, and experiencing high-stress levels and symptoms of fatigue, was associated with a significant reduction in perceived stress over time. However, stress reduction, as measured by the PSS (primary outcome measure), was not significantly different to those observed in the placebo group. Based on the findings from secondary and exploratory outcome measures, self-reported fatigue was reduced, and HRV increased over time compared to the placebo group. Men supplementing with the ashwagandha extract also experienced increases in FT and LH concentrations. However, compared to the placebo, ashwagandha supplementation was not associated with greater improvements in other self-report measures of stress and general well-being, or other measured blood markers. Based on these results, a further examination into populations that may benefit from ashwagandha supplementation will be important, as its stress-reducing effects may differ based on age, sex, BMI status, and other comorbidities. Moreover, the anti-fatigue effects of ashwagandha require further examination in clinical trials as fatigue is a symptom prevalent across many mental and physical conditions and can significantly impact quality of life. Ashwagandha supplementation was well-tolerated with no major self-reported adverse reactions and no changes in anthropometric measures (BMI, WC, and WHR) blood pressure, and safety blood makers comprising the liver function test, full blood count, and renal function. To help understand the benefits of ashwagandha supplementation and potential mechanisms of action, further investigation in robust, adequately powered clinical trials will be required.

Early detection of DILI in clinical practice

The key to preventing clinically significant liver injury from DILI is early detection of the signal event before it becomes symptomatic or severe. Therefore, individuals taking a drug with a moderate to high likelihood of causing DILI should undergo laboratory and clinical monitoring using a validated surveillance program, but only a few bona fide protocols exist. Currently, the FDA advises practitioners to follow recommendations in the FDA product labels for a multitude of potential hepatic adverse events. In addition, patients taking potentially hepatoxic medications are advised to report any new or untoward symptoms to their provider.

FDA‐approved labels are available online and can be searched through the FDA database, Drugs@FDA. Substantial differences have been identified between US (FDA) and European Medicines Agency drug labeling recommendations regarding hepatoxicity. For example, 8.7% of the warnings for drug hepatoxicity and 21.3% of the contraindications for patients with liver disease were disparate in a recent study.

The package inserts of currently approved drugs may recommend (i) monitoring, with or without providing a schedule for testing or any instructions; (ii) therapy discontinuation if symptoms and/or signs of liver injury supervene; or (iii) medication discontinuation or interruption for specified laboratory abnormalities. According to Table, the specific recommendations vary substantially by agent. Although many medications have been associated with liver‐related fatalities, only a minority carry a black box warning for hepatotoxicity. Some recently approved drugs and biological agents have concrete recommendations for monthly laboratory monitoring during the first 12 months of therapy to detect acute hepatocellular injury. In contrast, VBDS was observed during clinical studies of pexidartinib, a monoclonal antibody used to treat tenosynovial giant cell tumor. To ensure prompt treatment modification or discontinuation in patients with early liver injury, a comprehensive risk evaluation and mitigation strategy has been instituted by the FDA for pexidartinib that requires the registration and clinical monitoring of all treated patients.

### Herbal medicines for the treatment of functional and inflammatory bowel disorders [^113edV7s]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

In many parts of the world, there continues to be a long-standing tradition of prescribing herbal products for a range of gastrointestinal conditions. Scientific evidence supporting the use of all herbal preparations is imperfect, however, and available studies are plagued by methodological limitations. For functional gastrointestinal disorders, there is limited evidence supporting the use of some well-characterized preparations. A number of herbals have immunomodulatory activity, and in inflammatory bowel disease there are limited positive placebo-controlled trials; other studies used active controls with suboptimal doses of the comparators. Like all drugs, herbals can lead to serious adverse events (eg, hepatic failure). Quality control is a serious issue to consider when prescribing herbal medicines. Many herbal preparations are marketed without evidence for stringent adherence to good manufacturing practice guidelines. Unpredictable environmental conditions may affect the composition and the concentration of the active ingredients of plant extracts. Further, commercial herbal products usually combine a variable plethora of chemical families with possible medicinal utility. While some of these ingredients might be of benefit, the concentration and dose of these constituents needs to be closely monitored. Physicians and regulators need to remain very cautious about the use of herbal remedies. Appropriate scientific evidence for the claimed clinical benefits should become mandatory worldwide, and the standards for production and safety monitoring should comply with established standards for chemically defined products. If these principles were adopted, the full value of herbal remedies may come to light, particularly as the individually bioactive compounds present in these preparations become recognized.

### Norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol (Femynor) [^112dpDRD]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

5.2 Liver Disease

Impaired Liver Function

Do not use Femynor in women with liver disease, such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of liver [see Contraindications (4)]. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue Femynor if jaundice develops.

Liver Tumors

Femynor is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see Contraindications (4)]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.

Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (> 8 years) COC users. However, the risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users.

5.3 High Blood Pressure

Femynor is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see Contraindications (4)]. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Femynor if blood pressure rises significantly.

An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin.

5.4 Gallbladder Disease

Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC related cholestasis.

5.5 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects

Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who take Femynor. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance.

Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs.

Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs.

5.6 Headache

If a woman taking Femynor develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Femynor if indicated.

Consider discontinuation of Femynor in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event).

### ACG clinical guideline: the diagnosis and management of idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury [^11495hio]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a rare adverse drug reaction and it can lead to jaundice, liver failure, or even death. Antimicrobials and herbal and dietary supplements are among the most common therapeutic classes to cause DILI in the Western world. DILI is a diagnosis of exclusion and thus careful history taking and thorough work-up for competing etiologies are essential for its timely diagnosis. In this ACG Clinical Guideline, the authors present an evidence-based approach to diagnosis and management of DILI with special emphasis on DILI due to herbal and dietary supplements and DILI occurring in individuals with underlying liver disease.

A further observation in men was a trend suggesting a between-group difference in changes in MDA concentrations. This was signified by an 85% increase in MDA concentrations from baseline to week 12 in the ashwagandha group and only a 5% increase in the placebo group. As there was substantial variability in MDA concentrations over time in the ashwagandha group at week 12, this finding should be interpreted cautiously. In a previous ashwagandha study, MDA concentrations were reduced by 18% following 6 months of supplementation in healthy adults. In a review by, it was concluded that due to technical problems and inconsistent findings in healthy people and some psychiatric disorders, the reliability of MDA as a biomarker of oxidative stress requires re-evaluation. Despite this, it remains important to continue to investigate if ashwagandha supplementation has pro-oxidant effects in clinical and non-clinical populations.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines: drug-induced liver injury [^1123YXV8]. Journal of Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Idiosyncratic (unpredictable) drug-induced liver injury is one of the most challenging liver disorders faced by hepatologists, because of the myriad of drugs used in clinical practice, available herbs and dietary supplements with hepatotoxic potential, the ability of the condition to present with a variety of clinical and pathological phenotypes and the current absence of specific biomarkers. This makes the diagnosis of drug-induced liver injury an uncertain process, requiring a high degree of awareness of the condition and the careful exclusion of alternative aetiologies of liver disease. Idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity can be severe, leading to a particularly serious variety of acute liver failure for which no effective therapy has yet been developed. These Clinical Practice Guidelines summarize the available evidence on risk factors, diagnosis, management and risk minimization strategies for drug-induced liver jury.

Grip strength

Grip strength is a good indicator of overall body strength. Therefore, measurements were taken during the baseline and week-12 assessments. A Jamar Plus+ Digital Hand Dynamometer was used. Participants were instructed to hold the dynamometer in one hand while in a seated position with forearms resting on the armrests of the chair. The participants were required to squeeze the dynamometer as hard as possible for 5–10 s followed by a 5–10-s rest period. This was repeated using the same hand before changing to the other hand and repeating the procedure. Grip strength was measured in kilograms of pressure, with the highest score for each hand recorded.

Anthropometric measures

As a safety measure, several anthropometric measurements were taken over time. These included BMI, waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). WC was measured using a plastic tape measure at the narrowest point of the waist and the hip circumference was measured at the widest point of the hips when viewed from a lateral perspective.

Liver function, renal function, and full blood count (FBC)

As a safety measure, a blood sample was collected at baseline and week 12 to identify changes in liver function, renal function, and FBC. Blood samples were collected at any time of the day with no fasting requirements.

Adverse effects

To assess the tolerability of capsule intake, participants completed online questionnaires every 7 days asking for adverse effects, medication/ supplement changes, and illnesses/injuries experienced over the previous week.

### Supratherapeutic vitamin D with a hair nutraceutical: a case report [^117RkaGs]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

While adequate vitamin and mineral levels are essential for hair health, excessive supplementation may have unintended consequences. Vitamin D toxicity, though rare, can cause severe hypercalcemia, with potentially life-threatening sequelae including renal failure and arrhythmias. Supratherapeutic levels of vitamins such as vitamin A and selenium may actually worsen alopecia, as they have been associated with hair shedding when taken in excess. Additionally, excessive iodine can contribute to thyroid dysfunction, which is a well-established cause of diffuse hair loss. Patients taking high-dose iodine supplements or consuming iodine-rich formulations should therefore be monitored for thyroid abnormalities.

Biotin, a popular supplement for hair growth that is present in Nutrafol, can also interfere with thyroid tests and cardiac biomarkers. High biotin intake has been associated with falsely suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, potentially leading to misdiagnosis of thyroid disorders. More critically, in emergency settings where an acute myocardial infarction is suspected, biotin can falsely lower cardiac troponin concentrations, potentially delaying life-saving interventions. Fortunately, new assays are being developed to eliminate biotin interference. Biotin is often present in hair nutraceuticals at much higher levels than recommended; Nutrafol contains 10,000% of the recommended DV (Table I). Physicians should be aware of biotin's impacts on lab results and advise patients to discontinue use before testing whenever possible.

Finally, nutraceuticals such as Nutrafol contain potentially hepatotoxic compounds, including turmeric, ashwagandha, horsetail, saw palmetto, kelp minerals, and resveratrol, with turmeric representing the highest risk (Table II). Case reports have documented liver enzyme elevations and acute liver injury following supplementation with such botanicals. A 26-year-old woman developed acute liver injury following Nutrafol use, presenting with jaundice and significantly elevated liver enzymes. Her liver function tests improved following discontinuation of the supplement, strongly implicating Nutrafol as the likely cause of her liver injury. Patients with underlying liver disease and those taking other hepatotoxic medications should avoid supplements with these ingredients.

Table II
Hepatotoxic agents contained in best-selling hair growth nutraceuticals

These findings emphasize the importance of patient education and physician oversight when considering hair loss supplements. While nutritional deficiencies should be corrected, excessive supplementation may lead to unintended supratherapeutic levels or adverse effects. Greater research and regulatory oversight are needed in the nutraceutical industry to ensure that supplements are both safe and effective.

### Drug induced hepatitis mimicking Wilson's disease secondary to the use of complex naturopathic regimens: a case report [^113PfsLX]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Her ultrasound in June and her follow up ultrasound in August have signs of nodularity and coarse echotexture. Her most available FIB-4 score 2.29, which is not supportive of cirrhosis but does not rule out fibrosis. 1 Her acute liver injury, due to its prolonged nature, may have caused sufficient architectural distortion to cause fibrosis, which was exacerbated by the patient's continued taking of her NHPs during her clinical journey, despite advice from her physicians.

A review of the literature was undertaken to explore possible liver outcomes in association with her naturopathic medications. Ashwagandha is a plant root extract, which has a LiverTox profile of C, suggesting a probable cause of apparent liver injury. Vitamin C, even at mega doses, is unlikely to cause clinically significant liver injury. No case reports were found on alpha lipoic acid or probiotics. Our patient was prescribed several regimens of combined intravenous injections which are summarized in Table 1. None of these products have individual high-risk liver toxicity profiles or case reports, but in combination, liver toxicity increases. In addition to these IV treatments, she was prescribed selenium chloride, which has some evidence of causing cirrhosis in animal studies, but no significant liver toxicity has been reported in humans. Finally, there have been multiple case reports on Herbalife, which is a naturopathic medication consisting of a combination of various products. These products have a high LiverTox profile; class A (established cause of clinically apparent liver injury). Using IBM Micromedex drug reference software, there were no interactions between any of her medications, inclusive of Rivaroxaban and her known NHPs, although some NHPs were not available for comparison (see Table 1).

### Estimated exposure to 6 potentially hepatotoxic botanicals in US adults [^111wkuMm]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What percentage of US adults consume at least 1 of 6 potentially hepatotoxic botanical products?

Findings

In this survey study analyzing nationally representative data from 9685 adults, 4.7% of US adults reported exposure to 6 potentially hepatotoxic botanicals: turmeric was most frequently reported, followed in order by green tea, ashwagandha, Garcinia cambogia, red yeast rice, and black cohosh products. Botanical product users were significantly older, more educated, and more likely to have arthritis compared with nonusers.

Meaning

The results of this study suggest that clinicians should be aware of possible adverse events from consumption of these largely unregulated products.

### Herbal and non-herbal dietary supplements for psychiatric indications: considerations in liver transplantation [^1174rRHR]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine (TCIM) modalities are widely employed. However, TCIM, specifically herbal and non-herbal dietary supplements, can pose challenges in the context of organ transplantation. In this review, we discuss common supplements used for psychiatric purposes and highlight important considerations for candidates and recipients of liver transplants.

Recent Findings

Ashwagandha, kava kava, green tea extract, skullcap, turmeric, and valerian have known idiosyncratic hepatotoxic potential and may complicate the liver transplantation course. Multiple supplements reportedly carry a lower risk of hepatotoxicity, though evidence for widespread use in those at risk for or with hepatic impairment is limited. Psychiatrists caring for candidates and recipients of liver transplants must recognize that patients may find supplements helpful in alleviating psychiatric symptoms, despite an overall limited evidence base. Evaluating benefit versus risk ratios and reviewing drug-drug interactions is essential to promote transplant candidacy and mitigate the possibility of native or graft liver dysfunction.

Procedures

All consenting and eligible volunteers were required to attend the office of Clinical Research Australia on two occasions, at the commencement and conclusion of his or her 12-week participation in the study. Prior to attending each visit, participants were required to visit his or her local pathology collection center and provide a blood sample. The blood sample tested for liver function, kidney function, complete blood count, TSH, and HbA1C. Prior to the initial visit, volunteers with abnormal results were informed that they were ineligible to participate. Each assessment lasted approximately 60 min and involved anthropometric measurements, a blood collection, measurement of Heart Rate Variability (HRV), a grip strength test, and completion of questionnaires. Participants were given a 12-week supply of capsules. Participants took 1 capsule (containing either 200 mg of an ashwagandha extract or a matching placebo) twice daily, either with or without food, for 12 weeks. Participants were also required to complete a weekly questionnaire that asked about any adverse and/or significant events.

### Exploring the efficacy and safety of a novel standardized ashwagandha () root extract (witholytin ®) in adults experiencing high stress and fatigue in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^111e77Lv]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

In this study, there were no significant between-group differences in changes in the PSS, the primary outcome measure and a validated self-report measure of perceived stress in adults. However, this finding contrasts with other studies investigating the effects of ashwagandha using the PSS, which have found positive (stress-reducing) effects on PSS scores over time. In this study, there was a significant improvement (reduction) in the PSS score, with the ashwagandha group improving by 39.5%, but there was also a significant placebo effect, whereby PSS scores were reduced by 35.2%. Surprisingly, significant placebo effects have not typically occurred in previous studies conducted on ashwagandha, which may account for the non-significant finding in this study. However, in this study, the magnitude of change in PSS scores in the ashwagandha group was similar to those identified in previous studies. For example, in a 60-day study on Indian adults with high stress, PSS scores reduced by 44% in participants taking an ashwagandha extract for 8 weeks, but there was only a 5.5% reduction in the PSS scores in the placebo groups. In another 8-week study on healthy, stressed Indian adults, the administration of an ashwagandha extract reduced the PSS scores by 33%, but PSS scores only reduced by 3.6% in the placebo group. Reasons for these dramatically different placebo effects require future investigation, although differences in the populations recruited could be a factor accounting for this finding. Moreover, it has been identified in some studies that cultural factors and beliefs may affect the placebo response. In a review of placebo treatments for ulcers, there was significant variation in the placebo response across countries, with German participants experiencing a 59% placebo response compared to only 7% in Brazilian participants. As ashwagandha use is more commonplace in India, this may also account for the lack of placebo response in studies conducted in India.

Background

Stress is a state of homeostasis in the body being challenged, resulting in a systemic response. It has become more prevalent in recent years and affects mental and physical health.

Aims

Evaluate the effects of ashwagandha on stress, fatigue, and sex hormones in overweight or mildly obese men and women with self-reported stress and fatigue.

Methods

Two-arm, parallel-group, 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial on overweight or mildly obese men and women aged 40–75years, supplementing with 200mg of an ashwagandha root extract (Witholytin®) twice daily.

Results/Outcomes

Supplementation with ashwagandha was associated with a significant reduction in stress levels based on the Perceived Stress Scale (primary outcome); however, the improvements were not significantly different to the placebo group (p = 0.867). Based on the Chalder Fatigue Scale, there was a statistically significant reduction in fatigue symptoms in the ashwagandha group compared to the placebo group (p = 0.016), and participants taking ashwagandha also experienced a significant increase in heart rate variability (p = 0.003). However, there were no significant between-group differences in other self-report outcome measures. In the men taking ashwagandha, there was a significant increase in the blood concentrations of free testosterone (p = 0.048) and luteinizing hormone (p = 0.002) compared to the placebo group.

Conclusions/Interpretation

The results of this study suggest that in overweight middle-to-older age adults experiencing high stress and fatigue, compared to the placebo, ashwagandha did not have a significantly greater impact on perceived stress levels. However, based on secondary outcome measures, it may have anti-fatigue effects. This may be via its impact on the autonomic nervous system. However, further research is required to expand on these current findings.

### A bird' s-eye view of the multiple biochemical mechanisms that propel pathology of Alzheimer's disease: recent advances and mechanistic perspectives on how to halt the disease progression targeting multiple pathways [^112bwNYT]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Withania somnifera (ashawagandha) root extract has been used for thousands of years in ayurvedic medicine as a promoter of brain health and neurological functions, and thus has been proven to be at least well tolerated and non-toxic for human use. Interestingly, several groups have recently used various forms of ashwagandha extract as a neuroprotective agent in vitro and in vivo. Ashwagnadha extract has shown to ameliorate key inflammatory cytokines and modulated stress response. In particular, Seghal et al. in 2012 demonstrated that ashwagandha reversed AD pathology by enhancing low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein in the liver of transgenic mice. Furthermore, the extract was shown to reduce the amount of oxygen species. Their results showed that the extract did indeed enhance reduction of amyloid plaques as well as improving behavior. However, the doses of the extract administered were unrealistically high (1 g/kg/day) to be translated for use in humans. Of course, better formulations need to be developed to increase the bioavailability so that the extract can be used in humans. Alternatively, lower doses of ashwagandha extract could be combined with other natural compound/extracts to enhance the neuroprotective potential as a combination. Based on these recent findings, ashawagnahda should prove to be a potential therapeutic to halt the pathogenesis of AD, but further research is required.

Similarly to ahswagandha, Bacopa monnieri (brahmi) has also been used as a nerve tonic in Ayurveda. Extract of brahmi was shown to protect neurons from Aβ-induced cell death, and the mechanism was thought to be via inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity suppression. In the same study done by Limpeanchob et al. brahmi extract was shown to promote cell survival as well as reduce ROS and lipid peroxidation, leading to cellular longevity. Brahmi was also shown to significantly improve the memory in amnesic mice treated with diazepam, scopolamine, or phenytoin. In a clinical trial, brahmi improved cognition in patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer-type. Alongside the improved cognition, various biochemical markers showed reduced inflammation (homocysteine, C-reactive protein, and tumor necrosis factor alpha) and oxidative stress (glutathione peroxidase, glutathione, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, and superoxide dismutase).

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^113s1NHW]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Diagnostic approach to drug-induced liver injury (DILI) — DILI is largely a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, and initial laboratory testing includes aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total and direct bilirubin, with serum albumin and international normalized ratio (INR) as severity markers. Clinically significant DILI is commonly defined as any one of the following: serum AST or ALT > 5× upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALP > 2× ULN (or pretreatment baseline if baseline is abnormal) on two separate occasions at least 24 h apart; total serum bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dl with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP; or INR > 1.5 with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP. Although DILI can present with lower abnormalities, up to 20% of individuals in the general population have mildly increased liver biochemistries due to NAFLD, alcohol, and other common conditions.

### Flibanserin (Addyi) [^115o4Wmi]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: HYPOTENSION AND SYNCOPE IN CERTAIN SETTINGS

Interaction with Alcohol

The use of ADDYI and alcohol together close in time increases the risk of severe hypotension and syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Counsel patients to wait at least two hours after consuming one or two standard alcoholic drinks before taking ADDYI at bedtime or to skip their ADDYI dose if they have consumed three or more standard alcoholic drinks that evening.

Contraindicated with Strong or Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors

The concomitant use of ADDYI and moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increases flibanserin concentrations, which can cause severe hypotension and syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Therefore, the use of moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is contraindicated in patients taking ADDYI [see Contraindications (4)].

Contraindicated in Patients with Hepatic Impairment

The use of ADDYI in patients with hepatic impairment increases flibanserin concentrations, which can cause severe hypotension and syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Therefore, ADDYI is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4)].

WARNING: HYPOTENSION AND SYNCOPE IN CERTAIN SETTINGS

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

Use of ADDYI and alcohol together close in time increases the risk of severe hypotension and syncope. Counsel patients to wait at least two hours after consuming one or two standard alcoholic drinks before taking ADDYI at bedtime or to skip their ADDYI dose if they have consumed three or more standard alcoholic drinks that evening. (4, 5.1)
Severe hypotension and syncope can occur when ADDYI is used with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or in patients with hepatic impairment; therefore, ADDYI use in these settings is contraindicated. (4, 5.2, 5.5)

Blood markers and hormones

As detailed in Table 4, for men, there was no statistically significant time × group interactions in blood concentrations except for FT (F 1,104 = 4.00, p = 0.048) and LH (F 1,103 = 6.06, p = 0.016). In the ashwagandha group, there was a statistically significant 12.87% increase in FT (T (104) = 1.11, p = 0.002) and a non-significant decline of 1.69% in the placebo group (T (104) = 0.29, p = 0.772) from baseline to week 12. In the placebo group, there was a statistically significant 11.13% decrease in LH over time (T (103) = 2.14, p = 0.034) and a non-significant increase of 7.15% in the ashwagandha group (T (103) = 1.25, p = 0.213). Although not reaching statistical significance, there was a trend suggesting a between-group difference in change in MDA concentrations over time (F 1,106 = 3.70, p = 0.057). In the ashwagandha group, there was a statistically significant increase (84.69%) in MDA concentrations from baseline to week 12 (T (106) = 2.91, p = 0.004) and a non-significant increase of 5.45% in the placebo group (T (106) = 0.24, p = 0.813).

### Herbs and liver injury: a clinical perspective [^112J4JqM]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Despite a perception that herbal and dietary supplements are safe, devastating liver injury has been reported to result from their use. The difficulty in characterizing liver injury attributable to herbal and dietary supplements stems from the permissive regulatory environment, the complexity of marketed products, and underreporting by the patients who use them. Despite these limitations, researchers, clinicians, and regulators have increasing awareness of the need for study in this area.

### Herbal products and the liver: a review of adverse effects and mechanisms [^111TSabU]. Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Herbal products have been used for centuries among indigenous people to treat symptoms and illnesses. Recently, their use in Western countries has grown significantly, rivaling that of prescription medications. Currently, herbal products are used mainly for weight loss and bodybuilding purposes but also to improve well-being and symptoms of chronic diseases. Many people believe that because they are natural, they must be effective and safe; however, these beliefs are erroneous. Few herbal products have been studied in well-designed controlled trials of patients with liver or other diseases, despite testimony to the contrary. Moreover, current highly effective antiviral drugs make efforts to treat hepatitis C with herbal products redundant. Herbal products are no safer than conventional drugs and have caused liver injury severe enough to require transplantation or cause death. Furthermore, their efficacy, safety, and claims are not assessed by regulatory agencies, and there is uncertainty about their reported and unreported contents. We review the history of commonly used herbal products, as well as their purported efficacies and mechanisms and their adverse effects.

### Estimated exposure to 6 potentially hepatotoxic botanicals in US adults [^112ttXYD]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Herbal and dietary supplements (HDSs) include a multitude of products consumed by millions of people every day to improve their general health and to treat minor ailments. Over 80 000 HDS products can be purchased without a prescription at various unregulated retail outlets or via the internet. The largest group of HDS products used include multivitamins, minerals, vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acid, and calcium with well-defined ingredients on the label. However, an estimated 5% to 12% of HDS products are plant-derived, complex multi-ingredient botanicals. Chemical analyses of HDS products associated with confirmed liver toxic effects show frequent discrepancies between product labels and detected ingredients. The safety and efficacy of HDSs are not well established due to the lack of regulatory requirements by the US Food and Drug Administration for human pharmacokinetic or prospective clinical trials prior to marketing.

The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN), a multicenter US observational program that collects and analyzes data from patients with hepatotoxic effects attributed to various drugs and HDS products, found that the proportion of DILI cases from HDSs nearly tripled from 7% in 2004 to 2005 to 20% in 2013 to 2014. The most commonly implicated botanical products in the DILIN include turmeric, kratom, green tea extract, and Garcinia cambogia, with potentially severe and even fatal liver injury. Furthermore, the multicenter Acute Liver Failure Study Group has also demonstrated that an increasing proportion of DILI-related acute liver failure cases were caused by HDSs, increasing from 12.4% in 1998 to 2007, to 21.1% in 2007 to 2015.

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a periodic, population-based study of the general US population that includes comprehensive data regarding HDS use. In the current study, the proportion of NHANES patients who reported exposure to 6 potentially hepatotoxic botanicals — turmeric or curcumin, green tea, Garcinia cambogia, black cohosh, red yeast rice, and ashwagandha — were identified. The clinical features and baseline demographics of these individuals along with their self-reported reasons for taking these products are reviewed herein and compared with non–HDS users. To determine population level estimates of exposure to these products, US census data were used.

### Exploring the efficacy and safety of a novel standardized ashwagandha () root extract (witholytin ®) in adults experiencing high stress and fatigue in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^114s16qH]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Intervention

The intervention, containing a standardized ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) root extract, Witholytin®, was supplied by Verdure Sciences Inc. Ashwagandha and placebo capsules were identical in appearance, being matched for color, shape, and size. Each capsule of the active intervention contained 200 mg hydroalcoholic extract of the roots of ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) standardized to 1.5% total withanolides by high-performance liquid chromatography using United States Pharmacopeia Methodology. The same excipient, cellulose, was used in the preparation of both the ashwagandha and placebo capsules. Participants were instructed to maintain their existing lifestyle as closely as possible and take 1 capsule, twice daily (morning and evening), with or without food, for 12 weeks, delivering 400 mg of Witholytin® daily. Capsule adherence was assessed by the twice daily use of a mobile phone pill monitoring/reminder application, by weekly questionnaires asking participants to provide an estimate of the consistency of capsule intake (0–100%), and by the return of unused capsules at the final assessment. Treatment blinding was evaluated by asking participants to predict their group allocation (ashwagandha, placebo, or unsure) at the end of the study.

Randomization

Consenting and eligible participants were randomly allocated to one of two groups (ashwagandha or placebo). A randomization calculator was used to ensure sequence concealment and to create a randomization structure comprising 12 randomly permuted blocks, containing 10 participants per block, with a 1-to-1 ratio. Study identification numbers were allocated to participants based on attendance at their first in-person visit. All capsules were packaged in matching bottles labeled with two intervention codes. The sponsor held the identity of the intervention codes until all data were analyzed. Investigators and study participants were blind to the treatment group allocation until all outcome data were collected.
