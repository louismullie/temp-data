## Question

What is the best lab Test for localized lymphadenopathy in kids to rule out cancer

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the best laboratory test is to rule out cancer in a child with localized lymphadenopathy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pretest probability of malignancy in pediatric localized lymphadenopathy. Then, I should verify which laboratory tests meaningfully shift that probability. Next, I will examine whether any single lab test can reliably rule out cancer. After that, I need to check how clinical features modify risk and when to escalate to imaging and biopsy. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and state the bottom line clearly, making sure I anchor to guidelines and pediatric data throughout.

> Let me first confirm the baseline risk so I don't overcall malignancy. Most pediatric lymphadenopathy is benign and reactive, especially when localized and in the head and neck region; malignancy is uncommon in primary care cohorts and remains a minority even in referral series, though the proportion rises with concerning features and in older children, so I need to be cautious not to extrapolate adult data to pediatrics [^112YtB8B] [^111vYwkX] [^115SGEkh].

> Now, I should review which laboratory tests actually help. Wait, let me verify the essentials: a complete blood count with differential, inflammatory markers such as ESR and/or CRP, and LDH are the core labs that can flag hematologic malignancy or systemic inflammation; in children, I also need to consider infectious etiologies like EBV, TB, and cat-scratch disease when the history suggests them, and I should remember that LDH elevation, cytopenias, and abnormal liver enzymes increase suspicion for lymphoma or leukemia, though none are specific [^113gymPY] [^116EJVzK] [^114x2qXT] [^114TDSgw].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single "best" test. I need to check whether any standalone lab can rule out cancer; the answer is no, because no single blood test has sufficient sensitivity and negative predictive value to exclude malignancy in this setting, and excisional or core biopsy remains the diagnostic gold standard when clinical suspicion is high or nodes persist beyond a reasonable observation window, so relying on a single lab to "rule out" would be unsafe [^115XpGqu] [^116G1VnG] [^1151zT9H].

> Next, I should review how clinical features modify risk so I know when to escalate. Nodes larger than about 2–3 cm, persistence beyond 4–6 weeks without improvement, supraclavicular location, hard or fixed consistency, and systemic B symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss) all raise concern; mediastinal lymphadenopathy on chest imaging is particularly worrisome in older children and adolescents, and these features should lower the threshold for imaging and biopsy rather than relying on labs alone [^116EJVzK] [^115subBB].

> I will now examine the role of imaging because it often clarifies next steps. Ultrasound is the first-line modality for persistent peripheral nodes in children, helping assess size, shape, vascularity, necrosis, and matting; if ultrasound is concerning or nodes persist, excisional biopsy provides architecture for definitive diagnosis, whereas fine-needle aspiration alone is generally insufficient for lymphoma subtyping and may miss key patterns, so I should avoid FNA-only strategies when malignancy is suspected [^111TzYE4] [^1151zT9H] [^115XpGqu].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and double-check it aligns with guidelines. Start with history and exam to classify localized versus generalized disease and screen for red flags; obtain CBC with differential, ESR/CRP, LDH, and targeted infectious testing guided by history; if nodes are small, mobile, and improving, observe with close follow-up; if nodes are large, persistent, firm/fixed, supraclavicular, or accompanied by B symptoms or abnormal labs, obtain ultrasound and proceed to excisional or core biopsy rather than relying on labs to exclude cancer; throughout, avoid empiric corticosteroids that can mask lymphoma and confound histology [^112YtB8B] [^116EJVzK] [^111TzYE4] [^1151zT9H].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical or extranodal disease is suspected? I should confirm that additional workup may be needed: chest radiograph or CT for mediastinal disease, abdominal ultrasound for hepatosplenomegaly, and bone marrow evaluation if cytopenias or blasts suggest leukemia; in adolescents with mediastinal masses or systemic symptoms, T-lymphoblastic lymphoma and other aggressive lymphomas are considerations, reinforcing the need for timely tissue diagnosis rather than prolonged observation [^112CFHNF] [^116K6trV] [^112775nV].

> Bottom line, I need to ensure I state this precisely. There is no single laboratory test that can reliably rule out cancer in a child with localized lymphadenopathy; the best approach is a composite risk assessment using history, exam, and a basic laboratory panel (CBC with differential, ESR/CRP, LDH) to stratify risk, with ultrasound guiding the need for excisional or core biopsy when clinical features or persistence raise concern, because tissue diagnosis remains the definitive way to exclude malignancy [^112YtB8B] [^116EJVzK] [^111TzYE4] [^115XpGqu] [^1151zT9H].

There is **no single lab test** that can reliably rule out cancer in children with localized lymphadenopathy. The best initial approach is a **CBC with differential, ESR/CRP, and LDH** [^113gymPY] to screen for hematologic malignancy and guide next steps [^116EJVzK]. If results are abnormal or clinical suspicion persists, **excisional biopsy is the gold standard** for definitive diagnosis [^115XpGqu] [^116G1VnG]. Ultrasound can help assess node characteristics and guide biopsy, but **cannot exclude malignancy** [^111TzYE4] [^111DfdPL].

## Laboratory tests for initial evaluation

Several laboratory tests are commonly used in the initial evaluation of pediatric lymphadenopathy, but **none can definitively rule out malignancy**:

| **Test** | **Clinical utility** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Complete blood count (CBC) with differential | - Screens for anemia <br/> - Leukopenia <br/> - Leukocytosis <br/> - Thrombocytopenia <br/> - Atypical lymphocytes [^116aU3Um] | - Nonspecific <br/> - May be normal in early malignancy [^114ubooG] |
| Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) | Detect inflammation/infection; elevated in malignancy [^112zzqpg] | - Nonspecific <br/> - May be normal in indolent malignancy [^notfound] |
| Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) | Elevated in lymphoma/leukemia; useful marker [^116aU3Um] | - Nonspecific <br/> - May be normal in early/low-grade disease [^notfound] |
| Peripheral blood smear | Identifies blasts or abnormal cells suggestive of leukemia [^114ubooG] | - May be normal in early disease <br/> - Not definitive [^114ubooG] |
| Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) serology | Screens for infectious mononucleosis, a common benign cause [^114x2qXT] | - Nonspecific <br/> - Does not exclude malignancy [^notfound] |

---

These tests can suggest malignancy but **cannot exclude it**, especially in early or indolent disease [^116EJVzK].

---

## Imaging studies

Imaging is adjunctive; **ultrasound is first-line** to characterize nodes and guide biopsy, but cannot exclude malignancy [^111TzYE4] [^111DfdPL]:

- **Ultrasound**: Evaluates size, shape, vascularity, and necrosis; helps guide biopsy but cannot exclude malignancy [^111SpAoJ] [^111DfdPL].
- **Computed tomography (CT)**: Useful for deep nodes, mediastinal involvement, or when ultrasound is inconclusive; cannot exclude malignancy [^1169ZRzn].
- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: Alternative to CT, especially for soft tissue delineation; cannot exclude malignancy [^113GXvoj].

---

## Indications for biopsy

Biopsy is indicated when clinical suspicion for malignancy is high or when lymphadenopathy **persists without a benign diagnosis** [^1169ZRzn]:

- **Persistent lymphadenopathy**: > 4 weeks without resolution [^116EJVzK].
- **Large nodes**: > 2 cm, especially if hard, fixed, or rapidly growing [^116EJVzK].
- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, night sweats, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly [^113gymPY].
- **Abnormal labs**: Elevated LDH, cytopenias, or atypical lymphocytes [^116aU3Um].
- **Supraclavicular nodes**: High risk of malignancy [^116EJVzK].

---

## Gold standard diagnostic test

Excisional biopsy is the **gold standard** for definitive diagnosis, providing adequate tissue for histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and molecular testing [^115XpGqu] [^1151zT9H]. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is less invasive but has lower diagnostic yield and may miss architectural patterns critical for lymphoma diagnosis [^113YFsqj].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize a **stepwise approach**: start with history, exam, and basic labs (CBC, ESR/CRP, LDH); if suspicion persists, obtain imaging (ultrasound) and proceed to excisional biopsy for definitive diagnosis [^113gymPY] [^116EJVzK] [^111TzYE4].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

There is **no single lab test** that can reliably rule out cancer in children with localized lymphadenopathy. The best initial approach is a **CBC with differential, ESR/CRP, and LDH** to screen for hematologic malignancy and guide next steps [^117TzyQz]. If results are abnormal or clinical suspicion persists, **excisional biopsy is the gold standard** for definitive diagnosis [^115XpGqu]. Ultrasound can help assess node characteristics and guide biopsy, but **cannot exclude malignancy** [^116sgVwj].

Lymphadenopathy is a common finding on physical examination in the pediatric population. Although it is often physiologic, lymphadenopathy can also be associated with more serious illnesses and has many possible etiologies. A broad differential diagnosis can be narrowed with a thorough clinical history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and imaging. The goal of this review is to provide a framework for understanding normal physiology, identify when enlarged lymph nodes may be associated with pathology, develop differential diagnoses associated with lymphadenopathy, and apply a systematic approach for diagnostics and appropriate management, with a focus on findings concerning for malignancy and the initial evaluation.

The assessment of lymphadenopathy in children is a common diagnostic problem in pediatrics. An understanding of the wide variety of diseases and conditions that may present as lymphadenopathy is essential to determining the most appropriate work up for an individual patient. Although the majority of these children will prove to have a benign disorder, it is important that the pediatrician also have an appreciation for the malignant diseases that may present with lymphadenopathy, so that in such cases the diagnosis of a serious or life-threatening disease can be made in a timely manner.

Cervical lymphadenopathy affects as many as 90% of children aged 4 to 8 years. With so many children presenting to doctors' offices and emergency departments, a systematic approach to diagnosis and evaluation must be considered. In the following review, we aim to provide the pediatric clinician with a general framework for an appropriate history and physical examination, while giving guidance on initial diagnostic laboratory testing, imaging, and potential need for biopsy. The most common cause of cervical lymphadenopathy in the pediatric population is reactivity to known and unknown viral agents. The second most common cause includes bacterial infections ranging from aerobic to anaerobic to mycobacterial infections. Malignancies are the most concerning cause of cervical lymphadenopathy. The explosion in the use of ultrasonography as a nonradiating imaging modality in the pediatric population has changed the diagnostic algorithm for many clinicians. We aim to provide some clarity on the utility and shortcomings of the imaging modalities available, including ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging.

The differential diagnosis in pediatric lymphadenopathy includes bacterial, viral, fungal, and idiopathic causes. A systematic approach to patient evaluation is necessary because the differential diagnosis, presentation, and work up must consider infectious, immunologic, neoplastic, and idiopathic disorders. A thorough history and examination are vital to determining the diagnosis and ruling out a malignant process.

### Lymphadenopathy: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^116EJVzK]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Lymphadenopathy occurs in 0.6% of the population annually, usually from a benign cause. History should focus on lymph node location, duration of lymphadenopathy, associated symptoms (particularly fever, night sweats, and unintentional weight loss), past and current medical conditions, occupation, travel history, animal exposures, medication use, recent vaccine history, drug use, sexual history, and family history. Physical examination should first differentiate localized from generalized lymphadenopathy. Generalized lymphadenopathy is usually caused by underlying systemic disease. Although usually benign, localized lymphadenopathy may represent infection or malignancy, particularly if epitrochlear or supraclavicular nodes are affected. Lymph nodes that are larger than 2 cm, hard, or matted/fused to surrounding structures may indicate malignancy or granulomatous diseases, especially in children. When lymphadenopathy persists beyond four weeks or is accompanied by systemic symptoms, imaging and appropriate laboratory studies (eg, complete blood cell count, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, tuberculosis testing) should be obtained. Biopsy may be performed through fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, or excisional biopsy. Antibiotics may be considered if a benign or self-limiting etiology (eg, bacterial lymphadenitis) is suspected. Corticosteroids should be avoided because they can mask the histologic diagnosis of lymphoma or other malignancy.

### Unexplained lymphadenopathy: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^113wGzNw]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy is benign and self-limited in most patients. Etiologies include malignancy, infection, and autoimmune disorders, as well as medications and iatrogenic causes. The history and physical examination alone usually identify the cause of lymphadenopathy. When the cause is unknown, lymphadenopathy should be classified as localized or generalized. Patients with localized lymphadenopathy should be evaluated for etiologies typically associated with the region involved according to lymphatic drainage patterns. Generalized lymphadenopathy, defined as two or more involved regions, often indicates underlying systemic disease. Risk factors for malignancy include age older than 40 years, male sex, white race, supraclavicular location of the nodes, and presence of systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and unexplained weight loss. Palpable supraclavicular, popliteal, and iliac nodes are abnormal, as are epitrochlear nodes greater than 5 mm in diameter. The workup may include blood tests, imaging, and biopsy depending on clinical presentation, location of the lymphadenopathy, and underlying risk factors. Biopsy options include fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, or open excisional biopsy. Antibiotics may be used to treat acute unilateral cervical lymphadenitis, especially in children with systemic symptoms. Corticosteroids have limited usefulness in the management of unexplained lymphadenopathy and should not be used without an appropriate diagnosis.

### How to use… lymph node biopsy in paediatrics [^115XpGqu]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2017). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy is a common finding in children. It often causes anxiety among parents and healthcare professionals because it can be a sign of cancer. There is limited high-quality evidence to guide clinicians as to which children should be referred for lymph node biopsy. The gold standard method for evaluating lymphadenopathy of unknown cause is an excision biopsy. In this Interpretation, we discuss the use of lymph node biopsy in children.

This article provides an overview for evaluation and management of the pediatric patient with cervical lymphadenopathy. A thorough history and physical examination are crucial in developing a differential diagnosis for these patients. Although infectious causes of lymphadenopathy are more prevalent in the pediatric population compared with adults, neoplasms should also be considered. Judicious use of imaging studies, namely ultrasound, can provide valuable information for accurate diagnosis. Common and uncommon infectious causes of cervical lymphadenopathy are reviewed. Surgical intervention is occasionally necessary for diagnosis and treatment of infections, and rarely indicated for the possibility of malignancy. Indications for surgery are discussed.

### Analysis of children with peripheral lymphadenopathy [^116TgLXC]. Clinical Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

In this study, the clinical and laboratory features of children with lymphadenopathy were evaluated. Over a 3-year period, 126 patients were referred to the clinic for lymphadenopathy. Twenty-eight of cases have diseases mimicking lymphadenopathy; 98 (mean age: 86 ± 55 months) have lymphadenopathy. Localized, limited, and generalized involvement was found in 52%, 30%, and 18% of patients. The most common localization was the head and neck region. The causes of lymphadenopathy were benign diseases in 75 patients. Sixty percent were reactive lymphadenopathy, 39% were lymphadenitis. Lymphadenitis was more frequently localized and bigger than 3 cm compared with reactive adenopathy (p = .02, p = .004). Twenty-three patients have malignant diseases whose mean age was higher than others (p = .002). The enlargement of supraclavicular nodes was more likely due to malignant disease (p = .001). The risk of malignant disease was higher in patients who had generalized lymphadenopathy, lymph nodes bigger than 3 cm, hepatosplenomegaly, and high lactate dehydrogenase levels. In conclusion, this study pointed out the important clues for the differential diagnosis, which were present in the history, physical, and laboratory findings.

### Lymphadenopathy and malignancy [^113hHaki]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

The majority of patients presenting with peripheral lymphadenopathy have easily identifiable causes that are benign or self-limited. Among primary care patients presenting with lymphadenopathy, the prevalence of malignancy has been estimated to be as low as 1.1 percent. The critical challenge for the primary care physician is to identify which cases are secondary to malignancies or other serious conditions. Key risk factors for malignancy include older age, firm, fixed nodal character, duration of greater than two weeks, and supraclavicular location. Knowledge of these risk factors is critical to determining the management of unexplained lymphadenopathy. In addition, a complete exposure history, review of associated symptoms, and a thorough regional examination help determine whether lymphadenopathy is of benign or malignant origin. Unexplained lymphadenopathy without signs or symptoms of serious disease or malignancy can be observed for one month, after which specific testing or biopsy should be performed. While modern hematopathologic technologies have improved the diagnostic yields of fine-needle aspiration, excisional biopsy remains the initial diagnostic procedure of choice. The overall evaluation of lymphadenopathy, with a focus on findings suggestive of malignancy, as well as an approach to the patient with unexplained lymphadenopathy, will be reviewed.

### Why does my patient have lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly? [^113aDEWh]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Lymph node or spleen enlargement may be innocent or the first sign of a serious disorder. Lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly can be found in symptomatic or asymptomatic patients. Lymph node enlargement in a single region or multiple sites can be seen in various diseases, including infections, noninfectious inflammatory conditions, or malignancies; a similar differential diagnosis applies to splenomegaly, but splenomegaly can also be caused by vascular abnormalities and hemolysis. Frequently, lymphadenopathy is detected incidentally during screening examinations or imaging procedures. This review focuses on causes of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly and an appropriate diagnostic approach to patients with lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly.

### Lymphadenopathy in children: a streamlined approach for the surgeon – A report from the APSA cancer committee [^115aWz9k]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background/Purpose

Lymphadenopathy is a common complaint in children. Pediatric surgeons are often called upon to evaluate, treat, and/or biopsy enlarged lymph nodes. With many nonsurgical causes in the differential diagnosis, the surgeon plays the important role of providing reassurance and timely diagnosis while minimizing the pain and morbidity associated with surgical interventions in children. The purpose of this summary paper is to provide a management guide for surgeons working up children with lymphadenopathy.

Materials/Methods

The English language literature was searched for "lymphadenopathy in children". All manuscript types were considered for review, regardless of medical specialty, with emphasis placed on published guidelines, algorithms, and reviews. After thorough review of these manuscripts and cross-referencing of their bibliographies, the attached algorithm was developed, with emphasis on the role and timing of surgical intervention.

Results

The APSA Cancer Committee developed the attached algorithm to fill a gap in the surgical literature. It outlines lymphadenopathy workup and treatment with emphasis on the role and timing of surgical intervention.

Conclusion

This review defines and summarizes the common etiologies and presentations of lymphadenopathy in children, and offers a straightforward algorithm for evaluation of and treatment with an emphasis on malignancy risk and surgical management.

### Evaluation of peripheral lymphadenopathy in children [^115SGEkh]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate children with lymphadenopathy and clinical approach to the suspicion of malignancy. The authors evaluated 457 patients with peripheral lymphadenopathy, less than 19 years of age, and referred to the Pediatric Oncology Department of Gazi University Medical School during the periods March 1996-April 2004. A total of 346 patients had benign disorders and 111 had malignant pathologies. Excisional biopsies were performed to 134 patients. A specific etiology could be found 39% in the benign group. Of the 457 patients, 218 were presented as acute, the rest as chronic lymphadenopathy. In the acute lymphadenopathy group, 98.2% of the patients had benign etiologies. The malignant disorders were mostly represented as chronic lymphadenopathy. Concerning the extension, 193 patients had localized lymphadenopathy and 264 had generalized lymphadenopaties. Cervical region was the most frequent site in both localized and generalized lymphadenopathy groups. Malignancies occurred as generalized lymphadenopathy. Supraclavicular area were involved only in the malignant group. Axillary involvement was predominant in BCG vaccine associated lymphadenitis and mycobacterium tuberculosis. All the lymph nodes less than 1 cm were due to benign causes. The malignant lesions were usually more than 3 cm in diameters. The following findings should alert the pediatrician for the probability of a malignant disorder: lymphadenopathy of more than 3 cm in size, of more than 4 weeks in duration, with supraclavicular involvement, and with abnormal laboratory and radiological findings.

### Persistent osteoarticular pain in children: early clinical and laboratory findings suggestive of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (a multicenter case-control study of 147 patients) [^114ubooG]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood malignancy, accounting for 25% of cancers in children. In 15–30% of cases, ALL is diagnosed because of isolated and persistent osteoarticular complaints without clear laboratory features which could direct the diagnosis (normal blood count and absence of blasts in peripheral blood smear). Moreover, this form of ALL is associated with a lower incidence of hepatomegaly, splenomegaly or lymphadenopathy. The time between the first episode of bone or joint pain and a bone marrow examination is sometimes a period of several months and there can be a long succession of visits to either the orthopedist or the rheumatologist pediatrician. The first diagnosis, proposed for 76.5% of cases of bone and articular manifestations, is juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), the most common rheumatic disease in children, defined according to the International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) criteria. However, this is a diagnosis of exclusion that rules out other rheumatic or infectious diseases and malignancies, such as ALL. ALL and JIA can both present with chronic joint and periarticular complaints, fever, hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy, anemia and elevated inflammatory markers. A bone marrow examination is the best way for the clinician to diagnose ALL, especially when blasts are absent in peripheral blood smear. When there is no hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy, and when osteoarticular complaints are localized, it seems to be harder to distinguish ALL from non-systemic forms of JIA.

Some studies have compared clinical and laboratory data obtained before the diagnosis of ALL or JIA in children presenting with chronic osteoarticular manifestations. In the case of ALL, most of them described sudden, intense and localized periarticular pain, whereas in the case of JIA, articular complaints appear in a more progressive manner, with morning stiffness and arthritis. With regard to laboratory data, it has been described that in the event of ALL, platelets and leukocytes are normal or decreased, whereas their rate is often elevated in the case of JIA. Nevertheless, these different parameters seem to be insufficient for clinicians to distinguish ALL from JIA.

The aim of this study was to describe early clinical and laboratory features associated with ALL in children presenting with isolated persistent osteoarticular pain for at least one month. These criteria could efficiently lead to the diagnosis of ALL rather than JIA, and allow physicians to perform a bone marrow examination as early as possible, before the appearance of hepatomegaly, splenomegaly or lymphadenopathy, high lymphocyte levels, cytopenia and blasts in peripheral blood smear.

### Head and neck lymph nodes in children: the spectrum from normal to abnormal [^1127tgDt]. Pediatric Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy of the head and neck region is a common finding in children and a very common reason to image the craniocervical region. Enlarged lymph nodes are commonly palpated by the pediatrician in the office and commonly imaged by the pediatric radiologist. The difficult task of the clinician is to determine whether the adenopathy is acute (< 3 weeks) or chronic (> 6 weeks) and when imaging is indicated. In children, radiation is always a consideration when choosing an imaging modality; thus, US is usually the first imaging study at our institution, and CT the second option, usually reserved for the very ill child or for when there is a high index of suspicion for malignancy. We present the normal anatomy of head and neck lymph nodes and the US, CT, and MRI appearances in normal and pathologic states to help clinicians generate a reasonable differential diagnosis and prevent unnecessary procedures.

### Pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma, version 3.2021 [^113gymPY]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma — history, physical, and laboratory workup should include determination of B symptoms defined as unexplained recurrent fevers > 38°C within the last month, drenching night sweats within the last month, and weight loss of > 10% of body weight within 6 months of diagnosis, with examination of lymphoid regions and spleen. Essential tests include complete blood count with differential, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and/or C‑reactive protein, and a comprehensive metabolic panel. A pregnancy test should be performed before individuals of childbearing potential undergo treatment, and HIV and hepatitis B and C testing are encouraged for patients with risk factors for HIV or unusual disease presentations. An immunodeficiency workup should also be considered for patients < 5 years of age, those with recurrent infections, those with an atypical presentation, and those with a personal or family history of immunodeficiency.

### Cervical lymph node biopsies in the evaluation of children with suspected lymphoproliferative disorders: experience in a tertiary pediatric setting [^115subBB]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background/Purpose

The objectives of this study were: (1) to determine the incidence of lymphoproliferative disorders in a cohort of patients requiring a biopsy at a tertiary pediatric center; and (2) to elucidate the demographic, clinical, laboratory and diagnostic imaging characteristics associated with a malignant diagnosis.

Methods

A retrospective review of pediatric cervical lymph node biopsies performed between 2012 and 2019 at a tertiary center was undertaken. Demographic data, clinical presentations, laboratory results, diagnostic imaging findings, and pathology results were compiled and analyzed to identify characteristics associated with a malignant diagnosis.

Results

Malignancy was identified in 49.5% of patients (55/111) subjected to a cervical lymph node biopsy. The median age of patients with a benign diagnosis was lower than malignant diagnosis (11.0 vs. 14.0 years, p < 0.01). Mediastinal lymphadenopathy based on chest radiography and/or computed tomography scan was identified in 37/49 malignant cases (75.5%) CONCLUSION: In this retrospective study, 49.5% of biopsies performed at a tertiary pediatric setting yielded a malignant diagnosis. Traditional clinical characteristics such as weight loss, night sweats and nodal texture were not informative when derived retrospectively. The most valuable features identified were increased age, increased long and short axis measurements of the involved node(s), and the presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^114AD7pq]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Presumed infectious lymphadenopathy in adults — empiric antibiotics and follow-up: While some sources acknowledge that resolution of inflammatory lymphadenopathy may take 6 to 12 weeks, most sources recommend observation limited to 2 weeks and do not advise delaying further evaluation beyond the initial 2-week period; it is reasonable to prescribe a single course of a broad-spectrum antibiotic for a neck mass that appears infectious provided the patient is followed, and a patient treated with antibiotics should be reassessed within 2 weeks; if the mass has not completely resolved, further workup for possible malignancy is recommended and partial resolution requires additional evaluation; if infectious lymphadenopathy resolves, the patient should be reassessed once more in 2 to 4 weeks to monitor for recurrence; in the absence of signs and symptoms suggesting infection, empiric antibiotics should be avoided and the mass should undergo further workup.

### Lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy: benign or malignant? [^114JtQ6Z]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

The increasing use of immunophenotypic and molecular analysis in the routine evaluation of patients with lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy, or other hematologic disorders has led to the identification of unexpected small clonal lymphoid populations. These clones, sometimes with disease-specific markers, such as the t(14;18), are especially challenging for the clinician because of their unknown biologic potential and uncertain clinical behavior. Study of these early lymphoid lesions is providing important clues to the process of lymphomagenesis, and may provide the rationale for preemptive therapy in the future. More and more, the hematologist/oncologist is consulted regarding otherwise healthy individuals with lymphadenopathy and/or lymphocytosis, and pathology reports that confound the referring internist or surgeon. The report does not name a malignant lymphoproliferative disorder, but is not completely "normal". Does the patient have a benign or malignant condition? How should they be evaluated? Is treatment indicated? These patients prove challenging for the consulting hematologist as well as the referring physician. In this review, we will focus on some of these scenarios and attempt to provide guidance for their management.

### Ethosuximide-induced drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms with mediastinal lymphadenopathy [^115QEE7R]. Pediatric Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Lymphadenopathy is a common sign for drug reaction and eosinophilia with systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome, but hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy may be underreported. We describe a 7-year-old boy who started taking ethosuximide for absence seizures and presented with diffuse rash, fever, elevated transaminases, facial swelling, and hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. His mediastinal lymphadenopathy was concerning for lymphoma, which led to more invasive testing to rule out malignancy. This report highlights an unusual and likely underreported presenting sign of DRESS syndrome in children.

Diagnostic Testing

Question 1: Should Lymph Node Sampling Be Performed in a Patient Presenting with Asymptomatic Bilateral Hilar Lymphadenopathy?

Rationale for question

Isolated involvement of mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes is a common presentation of sarcoidosis, and is readily detected by a routine chest X-ray. Many such patients are asymptomatic, and sarcoidosis is only suspected on the basis of radiographic testing for an unrelated reason. Patients with sarcoidosis with asymptomatic lymph node involvement generally have self-limited disease, and do not require treatment. However, the finding of enlarged hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes during radiographic testing is often alarming to healthcare providers and patients alike, primarily out of concern for an alternative diagnosis, such as occult malignancy or latent infection. Previous studies have reported that asymptomatic bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy is almost always caused by sarcoidosis, and, given the benign nature of this phenotype, there is clinical equipoise for pursuing diagnostic sampling in such patients.

Summary of evidence

Our systematic review identified 2,106 potentially relevant articles; the full text of 75 was reviewed. One study reported enrolling patients with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, but included both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, so the panel decided to separately consider 16 studies that enrolled patients with suspected radiographic stage 1 sarcoidosis. The study that enrolled patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy confirmed sarcoidosis in 72% (95% confidence interval, 61–81%), but found lymphoma in 10% (95% CI, 5.3–19%) and other diagnoses (i.e. nonlymphomatous malignancy, silicosis, fibrosis, and amyloidosis) in 7.7% (95% CI, 3.6–15.8%). The 16 studies that enrolled patients with suspected radiographic stage 1 sarcoidosis collectively included 556 patients who underwent at least 1 sampling procedure. Sarcoidosis was confirmed in 85% (95% CI, 82–88%) of patients, an alternative diagnosis was made in 1.9% (95% CI, 1–3.7%) of patients, and sampling was nondiagnostic in 11% (95% CI, 8–14%) of patients. Among the alternative diagnoses, 38% (95% CI, 14–69%) were TB and 25% (95% CI, 7.1–59%) were lymphoma. The only complication reported was a case of mediastinitis that occurred after an esophageal endoscopic ultrasound procedure.

### Rheumatic symptoms in childhood leukaemia and lymphoma-a ten-year retrospective study [^1128qdv9]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Haematological malignancies must be ruled out in children with musculoskeletal complaints. This is especially true if the pain is consistently strong, wakes the child at night, or localizes to a non-joint area, as these features are not characteristic for JIA, the most frequent chronic childhood rheumatologic disease. The frequent, so-called growing pains, are never accompanied by a laboratory or radiological alteration.

What causes the musculoskeletal complaints in a leukaemia or lymphoma? Infiltration of the synovia, the periosteum, or the bone marrow by malignant cells is one explanation, but a secondary uric acid or immune complex deposits may also cause pain and inflammation in a joint. A less common factor may be an intraarticular bleeding resulting from thrombocytopenia.

Our results support previous reports that suggest that pain disproportionate to physical findings, accompanied by haematologic alterations and pain not permanently alleviated by NSAIDs, strongly suggest the presence of a haematologic malignancy. But in contrast to other reports, only 20% of the newly diagnosed ALL patients had musculoskeletal symptoms, one third of them with accompanying general complaints. Fever, pallor, bone pain and night pain are the most likely symptoms of an underlying leukaemia. Severe night-time pains that awaken a child are not typical for JIA and point towards malignant diseases.

In most of our cases, arthralgias were localised at the hip joint. Other authors, e.g. Barbosa et al. found that rheumatologic pain of leukemic origin may also affect the lower limbs, especially the knee. Other reports mention wrist, ankle, and elbow involvement as well. In contrast, Trapani et al. found arthritis as the most frequent presenting symptom, mostly affecting one large joint in ALL. Arthralgia was less frequent in their study, localising mostly at the shoulders, arms, spine and knee. Arthritis was almost never accompanied by morning joint stiffness. Stiffness of the joints is an important symptom suggesting JIA over a malignancy. Interestingly, 79% of leukaemia patients in our series presenting with mono/oligo arthritis or arthralgia were boys. Thus in younger male children with oligoarticular disease the possibility of leukemia should also be entertained, especially because the 2/3 of oligoarticular JIA patients are girls. Lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly can be present in both ALL and JIA, so we don't regard it as a good differential diagnostic feature.

### How I approach: the workup and management of patients with progressive transformation of the germinal center [^1173Mm5F]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Progressive transformation of the germinal center (PTGC) is a common and underrecognized cause of pediatric lymphadenopathy. PTGC may be associated with numerous systemic medical conditions that require further workup and management, including malignancy, autoimmune conditions, lymphoproliferative conditions, immunodeficiency, and infection. Given the breadth and rarity of the associated conditions, workup should be tailored to the individual patient and occur in a tiered approach. Patients with PTGC require ongoing follow-up, given their long-term risk of malignancy and recurrent PTGC.

### Rapid access multidisciplinary lymph node diagnostic clinic: analysis of 550 patients [^1127CGjH]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy (LA) is common and affects patients of all ages. An annual incidence of 0.6–0.7% has been estimated for the general population. Patients with lymphadenopathy present to a wide range of medical specialties. When physicians are faced with these patients, the critical tasks are to differentiate benign from malignant lymph nodes, to identify serious medical conditions that require specialist care, and to reassure patients with benign reactive lymphadenopathy or self-limiting diseases.

The possibility of malignancy raises the most concern among patients and health care professionals. Prompt referral for definitive investigations and treatment cannot be overstated, as cancer is perhaps the disease people fear most. Despite the incidences of many cancers being broadly similar in England compared with other European countries and the United States, the corresponding survival rates are poorer (Table 1

Table 1
Five-year relative survival of common cancers). To address this problem, the British government proposed, in September 2000, the National Health Service (NHS) Cancer Plan to provide a comprehensive strategy for bringing together prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment and care for cancer to improve survival. The current guideline recommends all patients with lymphadenopathy of more than 1 cm in size persisting for 6 weeks to be referred urgently for further evaluation.

Apart from cancer, there are also other medical conditions presenting with LA that will require urgent medical attention. This would include infections such as tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), both of which pose an important public health problem. In addition, immune-induced injury disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis and rheumatoid arthritis will also require specialist care.

### Unexplained cervical lymphadenopathy in children: predictive factors for malignancy [^117XQKyC]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to determine clinical factors that are able to predict the likelihood of malignancy of unexplained cervical lymphadenopathy in children.

Methods

The data of 175 cases with unexplained cervical lymphadenopathy, including sex, age, fever, number of involved regions, and location and size of the largest node, were collected. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to find out the optimal parameter for size of the largest node. Logistic regression was applied to determine independent predictors for malignancy.

Results

On the basis of receiver operating characteristic analysis, the ratio of maximal width to maximal length (ratio) was confirmed as the optimal parameter of size for malignancy prediction, and its threshold, which maximized sensitivity and specificity, was 0.5. Multivariate binary logistic regression model indicated that number of involved regions (odds ratio [OR], 5.169; 95% confidence interval, 1.291–20.691; p = 0.020), location of the largest node (OR, 12.423; 95% CI, 3.657–42.205; p = 0.000), and ratio (OR, 52.080; 95% CI, 16.089–168.588; p = 0.000) were significant independent predictors of malignancy.

Conclusions

Higher ratio (> 0.5), multiple cervical regions of adenopathy (≥ 2), and region II or III location of the largest node are associated with malignancy. These data should be helpful to supplement clinical judgment in determining which enlarged cervical nodes harbor cancer.

### Imaging of pediatric neck masses [^113ZP3Mo]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Palpable neck masses are a common indication for pediatric imaging. Such lesions may be caused by infectious, inflammatory, tumoral, traumatic, lymphovascular, immunologic, or congenital etiologies. Radiological assessment of neck masses in young children should be tailored based on patient presentation and physical examination, as well as clinical suspicion. The goal of imaging should be to help arrive at a diagnosis or limited differential in an efficient manner while minimizing radiation exposure.

### Mediastinal lymphadenopathy in children with histoplasmosis [^111XwJ6i]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Mediastinal lymphadenopathy (ML) in children can arise from malignancy, infection, or rheumatic illness among others, and may be found incidentally on imaging or during workup for a variety of symptoms. Our aim was to describe the clinical presentation and natural history of histoplasmosis in children who present to a tertiary care center with ML in an endemic area of the country.

Methods

After institutional review board approval, a retrospective study of all children (aged < 21 y) presenting with proven (positive serologies) or suspected histoplasmosis (negative serologies, negative tuberculosis testing, and benign outcomes in follow-up) over a 5-y period was done. Seventy-four patients were tested; those with another diagnosis (n = 6) or without ML (n = 26) were excluded, for a total cohort of 44 patients. Demographics, clinical presentation, symptoms, laboratory data, treatment course, radiography studies, and inpatient and outpatient visits were examined.

Results

Of the 44 patients with ML, 27 had proven histoplasmosis, and 19 had suspected histoplasmosis. The median follow-up by imaging or clinical examination was 6.9 mo (0.3–73.2 mo). Sixteen patients received antifungal therapy with itraconazole, and 15 patients received at least one course of steroids, nearly all for respiratory symptoms; 11 patients (24%) received both. There was no difference in readmission rate (n = 5 versus 2, P = 0.7) or recurrence of symptoms (n = 2 versus 5, P = 0.4) between patients who received an antifungal and those that did not. Receiving steroid therapy was associated with airway narrowing and a higher readmission rate (n = 6 versus 2 who were not treated with steroids, P = 0.04), but not with symptom recurrence. Nine lymph node or mass biopsies were performed; however, the pathology only confirmed nonspecific infection in three and was nondiagnostic in the remaining six patients. Twenty-seven patients had at least one confirmatory laboratory test positive for histoplasmosis. Thirty-nine of the 44 patients (84%) with a diagnosis of histoplasmosis (proven or suspected) were asymptomatic by 1–2 mo follow up, with the remainder having intermittent chest pain or reactive airway disease.

Conclusions

ML because of proven or suspected histoplasmosis is usually a self-limiting disease that can be managed with treatment of the child's symptoms. Antifungals and steroids are of unclear benefit and may not alter the natural course of the disease. Biopsies are rarely diagnostic in the setting of ML, and invasive procedures should be avoided.

Proper management of pediatric thyroid nodules is crucial to achieving good outcomes. It is important to obtain a thorough history, including prior radiation exposure and family history of thyroid cancer and any symptoms of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. A complete physical examination with special attention to the thyroid gland and any cervical lymphadenopathy is important. Nodules between 5 and 10 mm with risk factors (clinical or sonographic) and all nodules greater than 10 mm should undergo a fine-needle aspiration biopsy. A comprehensive center of pediatric specialists is the best environment for treatment of these patients.

### The role of fine-needle aspiration cytology in children with persistent or suspicious lymphadenopathy [^111v4SKD]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was (1) To determine the value of fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in children with persistent or suspicious peripheral lymphadenopathy and (2) to analyze whether a history of previous malignancy influenced the accuracy of FNAC.

Methods

A retrospective study in an Academic Children's Hospital of 73 FNACs of peripheral lymph nodes in 64 patients (35 boys and 29 girls; median age, 9 years; range, 15 months to 20 years) was performed between 1992 and 1997. Eleven patients were excluded because aspirated material appeared inadequate. Outcome was compared with results of subsequent surgical biopsies, clinical follow-up, or both. Patients were divided into group A "de novo" lymphadenopathy (n = 39) and group B lymphadenopathy and a history of previous malignancy (n = 23).

Results

Group A: FNAC showed a benign diagnosis in 25 cases, a malignancy in 13, and was inconclusive in 1. Outcome was false-negative in 2 and false-positive in 1. Sensitivity and specificity were 86% and 96%, respectively. FNAC helped avoid additional surgical procedures in 27 cases (61%). However, if FNAC showed malignant lymphoma, open biopsy was inevitable (8 of 13) to establish proper classification. Group B: FNAC showed a benign diagnosis in 10 cases and a malignancy in 13. Outcome was false-negative in 1, and false-positive in 1. Sensitivity and specificity were 92% and 90%, respectively. FNAC helped avoid additional surgical diagnostic procedures in 25 cases (86%).

Conclusions

(1) Fine-needle aspiration cytology is a rapid, simple and accurate diagnostic procedure to differentiate between benign and malignant peripheral lymphadenopathy in children. FNAC can avoid open biopsy in at least 60% of cases. (2) A history of previous malignant disease does not influence the accuracy of the test.

### Assessment of peripheral lymphadenopathies: experience at a pediatric hematology-oncology department in Turkey [^115jaPhV]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

Since a large variety of disorders may lead to lymph node enlargement determining the cause of peripheral lymphadenopathy (LAP) in children can be difficult. This retrospective study evaluated 200 children who were admitted to an Oncology-Hematology department because of lymphadenopathy and aimed to determine the clinical and laboratory findings that were valuable for differential diagnosis. A specific cause for lymphadenopathy was documented in 93 (46.5%) cases. One hundred forty (70%) children were classified as having a benign cause for lymph node enlargements. Fourteen (10%) of these cases underwent an excisional lymph node biopsy, and histopathological examination showed a reactive hyperplasia. Sixty (30%) cases were classified as having a malignant disease-causing lymphadenopathy. In terms of differential diagnosis, some associated systemic symptoms, physical findings, and laboratory investigations showed significant difference between benign and malignant lymphadenopathy groups. The following findings were determined as being important to alert the physician about the probability of a malignant disorder: location of the lymphadenapathy (supraclavicular and posterior auricular), duration of the lymph node enlargement (> 4 weeks), size of the lymph node (> 3 cm), abnormal complete blood cell findings, abnormalities in chest X-ray, and abdominal ultrasonography.

### Cat scratch disease in pediatrics: who has systemic involvement? [^114TDSgw]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Bartonella henselae is the agent responsible for cat scratch disease (CSD). Although lymphadenopathy is typically the defining symptom, some patients develop potentially severe systemic compromise. It is unknown why some patients progress to systemic disease. The objective of this study was to describe the clinical, epidemiologic and laboratory characteristics of children with CSD and to analyze the differences between systemic versus localized infections.

Methods

Patients were identified by a retrospective review of medical records at a tertiary pediatric care hospital in Buenos Aires, Argentina, from January 2012 to July 2021. A CSD case was defined as any patient who presented compatible clinical findings with a positive serologic test (IgG > 1/64 or IgM immunofluorescence) for B. henselae.

Results

A total of 197 patients were identified, with a median age of 8 years (range: 1–17.4 years). The most frequent clinical symptoms were fever and lymphadenopathy. Systemic involvement was present in 34.5% (n = 68) of patients and the most common presentation was splenic abscess (n = 51), followed by liver abscess (n = 23), chorioretinitis (n = 9), osteomyelitis (n = 5) and pneumonitis (n = 3). Patients with invasive disease more frequently presented with fever (79.4% vs. 50.3%) (P < 0.001) and had higher C-reactive protein levels (24.9 vs. 6.7mg/L) (P < 0.001). Antibiotic therapy was administered to 95.9% (n = 187) of patients and most with systemic disease (77%) used combination treatment. Most patients recovered fully, and there were no reported deaths.

Conclusions

CSD must be considered a potential cause of lymphadenopathy. Patients with fever and elevated C-reactive protein should be evaluated to rule out systemic compromise.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^114kxAdp]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Committee conclusions

The committee acknowledged that most patients with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy will be confirmed to have sarcoidosis, especially among those presenting with Löfgren's syndrome, lupus pernio, or Heerfordt's syndrome. In asymptomatic bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy cases, sampling will be nondiagnostic in a substantial number of patients, and an alternative diagnosis (e.g. malignancy or infections) will be identified in a few cases, but those few cases may have important treatment implications. Factors to consider when weighing the risks and benefits of biopsy may include: regional prevalence of alternative infectious etiologies; patient-specific risk factors for malignancy, infection, or enhanced procedural risk; enlarging lymph nodes; likelihood of obtaining close follow-up; and patient preference. Finally, the availability of a maximally safe, efficacious, and cost-effective means of biopsy procedure is considered. Thus, the committee concluded that the decision to biopsy asymptomatic patients with bilateral hilar adenopathy should be made on a case-by-case basis.

Recommendations

1 In patients for whom there is a high clinical suspicion for sarcoidosis (e.g. Löfgren's syndrome, lupus pernio, or Heerfordt's syndrome), we suggest NOT sampling lymph nodes (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Remarks: Patients who do not undergo lymph node sampling require close clinical follow-up.
2 For patients presenting with asymptomatic bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, we make no recommendations for or against obtaining a lymph node sample. Remarks: If lymph node sampling is not obtained, close clinical follow-up was considered a reasonable alternative approach.

Research needs

All but one study selected for the systematic review enrolled patients with suspected sarcoidosis; therefore, the probability of finding sarcoidosis and alternative diagnoses in unselected patients with asymptomatic bilateral hilar adenopathy is uncertain and requires further investigation. Studies are needed to determine which clinical factors, including CT or chest radiographic manifestations, and/or biomarkers are the best determinants of pretest probability of sarcoidosis and which radiographic features are predictive of disease progression. Such predictive modeling might enable certain patients to be spared from biopsy, while heightening the need for early diagnosis in others. Studies are also needed to determine the true incidence of both minor and major complications of biopsy. Finally, studies that determine long-term outcomes, including treatment and disease course, are needed to determine the utility of early biopsy in asymptomatic patients.

Introduction: Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) is a potentially life-threatening systemic inflammatory condition characterised by cytopenias, liver dysfunction and coagulopathy. It can be secondary to active rheumatological diseases, malignancy and a number of infections.

Objectives: Highlight to busy Paediatric Rheumatology teams the importance of ruling out important differentials which can masquerade rheumatic conditions with MAS.

Methods: Case report

Results: 6-year female was referred to our Paediatric Rheumatology Service for possible systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA). She presented with 3-weeks fever, intermittent abdominal pain, mild cough, with travel history to Italy 6-months prior. Positive examination findings were palpable liver edge and shotty cervical lymphadenopathy. Laboratory markers demonstrated worsening Hb 86, falling WCC 4.43, falling platelets 165, low CRP 11, low ESR 3, rising ferritin 1069, rising LDH 1340, worsening transaminitis (AST 740, ALT 586, ALP 307, GGT 121, bilirubin 16), normal fibrinogen, mildly elevated triglyceride 1.98. sCD25 was 3902. Abdominal ultrasound showed splenomegaly with hypoechoic nodules. Echo was unremarkable with normal coronary vessels. Infectious Diseases work up included negative results for Hepatitis A, B and C, CMV, EBV, adenovirus and parvovirus, blood culture, urine culture, and normal CXR.

### Evaluation and management of the pediatric thyroid nodule [^114YiQiN]. The Oncologist (2015). Low credibility.

Thyroid nodules are commonly diagnosed in adults. Although rare in children, the risk for thyroid cancer is much higher in the pediatric population compared with adults. Presenting as either a solitary nodule or a multinodular goiter, thyroid nodular disease in children requires a thorough workup that includes a detailed clinical examination comprised of prior history of thyroid disease in the patient or in their family, history of radiation exposure, careful palpation of the thyroid and lymph nodes, blood tests, ultrasonography, and cytological assessment. Thyroid surgery is the gold-standard treatment for pediatric thyroid nodules; nonetheless, the extent of surgery remains controversial. Because surgery is not without risk, the decision matrix necessitates focus on the benefits of surgery for the child contingent upon all the preoperative exams. New diagnostic technology such as molecular testing with fine needle aspiration biopsy may help distinguish between benign and malignant lesions while potentially decreasing surgery for benign disease. The objective of this review is to summarize new concepts in clinical disease management of nodular thyroid disease in the pediatric population, including patient history, medical examination, and diagnosis workup.

### Clinical and metagenomic characteristics of lymphadenopathy related to fever of unknown origin in children [^112zzqpg]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical characteristics of different disease groups

Different disease groups exhibited unique manifestations (6 undiagnosed patients were not compared). Patients in the infectious disease group were the youngest, and the oldest were in the miscellaneous diseases group. Weight loss was more likely to be observed in the neoplastic group and was also commonly observed in the non-infectious inflammatory diseases group. As expected, hepatosplenomegaly was the most common complication in the neoplastic group. There were no significant differences in the diameter of the lymph nodes or the presence of more than 2 regional lymphadenectasis among the groups. If lymphadenectasis was discovered in the supraclavicular region, there was a greater likelihood of the final diagnosis being neoplastic diseases. However, if arthralgia was present, a non-infectious inflammatory disease was the most likely diagnosis. The duration of fever was longer for patients with non-infectious inflammatory diseases and neoplastic diseases. With further investigation, differences were observed not only in terms of general characteristics and symptoms but also in some laboratory test results. More than two types of hemocytopenia were more likely to be observed in the neoplastic diseases group, as expected. Interestingly, the WBC count was greater in the neoplastic group than in the infectious disease group. Furthermore, the lowest WBC count was observed in the miscellaneous disease group and the neoplastic disease group. As expected, the hemoglobin level was lowest in the neoplastic disease group. The LDH level was extremely high in the neoplastic disease group. The CRP level in the infectious disease group was even lower than that in the non-infectious inflammatory disease group, which was unexpected. The ESR was highest in patients in the non-infectious inflammatory disease group, followed by patients in the neoplastic disease group. For PCT and Lac, no significant differences were observed among the four groups (Table 3). According to our multivariable analysis, hepatosplenomegaly and the LDH level were associated with infectious disease (OR 10.559 and 0.998; 95% CI 2.172–51.336 and 0.997–1.000; P = 0.003 and P = 0.020). Arthralgia was correlated with non-infectious inflammatory disease (OR 29.391; 95% CI 2.307–374.459; P = 0.009). Weight loss and a node located in the supraclavicular region may indicate neoplastic disease (OR 918.889 and 4380.842; 95% CI 1.393–606193.104 and 2.630–9456316.108; P = 0.039 and P = 0.032) (Table 4).

Clinical presentation

In children, the median age at presentation is ∼8 to 12 years. Disease often presents with advanced stage and diffuse involvement including peripheral lymph nodes, mediastinal and intra-abdominal nodes, liver, spleen, bone marrow, and other extranodal sites (Figure 3). In children, this can include any combination of nodal, extranodal, and/or systemic/leukemic disease. Many also present with B symptoms. Patients may develop malignant effusions, including pleural and pericardial effusions. Laboratory tests often reveal elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Paraneoplastic features including hemophagocytosis with systemic inflammation, pruritis, or eosinophilia can be seen from inflammation of T-cell cytokine production. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement, although rare, has been described.

### Measurements of cervical lymph nodes in children on computed tomography [^117HJQms]. Pediatric Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Current guidelines and literature are inconsistent in terms of cut-off values for normal cervical lymph node sizes. None of them provides guidelines specifically for children. Based on the response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST), axial short-axis diameters should not exceed 10 mm, whereas the Lugano criteria state that axial long-axis diameter can be up to 15 mm without being malignant. However, these guidelines are specifically for malignant diseases and might therefore be inappropriate for distinguishing between normal and abnormal when looking at other causes (e.g. infectious disease). Other authors recommend a cut-off point of 15 mm in the long axis (all imaging planes) for Levels I–III and 10 mm for Levels IV–VI or a short axial axis cut-off of 11 mm for Levels II and III and 10 mm for all other levels. For ultrasound, a short-axis upper limit of 10 mm is generally used, as well. In our clinical practise a cut-off point of 10 mm in short-axis diameter in the axial plane is considered the upper limit for all levels except Level II, where 15 mm is used. With these size limits, four lymph nodes (all in different children) would have been classified as being enlarged at our centre (3% of the included children). Although size is an important criterion in assessing lymph nodes on all imaging modalities, other factors such as shape, borders, internal architecture and enhancement characteristics are of course important, as well. This is especially relevant because interrater variability is to some extent unavoidable when assessing measurements in radiologic images. This variability should be considered, and size alone should not be used to form clinical decisions, but rather other imaging features and the clinical presentation should be taken into account as well, especially when measurements approach the clinically used cut-off points.

### Laboratory clues to immunodeficiency; missed chances for early diagnosis? [^114GHXNU]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Primary immunodeficiency is seen in an estimated one in 1200 people, and secondary immunodeficiency is increasingly common, particularly with the use of immunosuppresion, cancer therapies and the newer biological therapies such as rituximab. Delays in the diagnosis of immunodeficiency predictably lead to preventable organ damage. Examples of abnormal pathology tests that suggest immunodeficiency from all laboratory specialities are given, where vigilant interpretation of abnormal results may prompt earlier diagnosis. If immunodeficiency is suspected, suggested directed testing could include measuring immunoglobulins, a lymphocyte count and T-cell and B-cell subsets.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) clinical presentation is typically nonspecific and may include fatigue or lethargy, constitutional symptoms (eg, fevers, night sweats, weight loss), dyspnea, dizziness, infections, and easy bruising or bleeding, and among children, pain in the extremities or joints may be the only presenting symptom. Physical examination may reveal lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and/or hepatomegaly and may be found in approximately 20% of patients, while abdominal masses from gastrointestinal (GI) involvement or chin numbness from cranial nerve involvement are more suggestive of mature B-cell ALL (B-ALL). Diagnostic criteria generally require demonstration of ≥ 20% bone marrow lymphoblasts on hematopathology review of bone marrow aspirate and biopsy materials, though the presence of an immunophenotypically clonal lymphoblast population of < 20% can be considered ALL in appropriate circumstances.

### Infectious mononucleosis: rapid evidence review [^114x2qXT]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Infectious mononucleosis is a viral syndrome characterized by fever, pharyngitis, and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy. It is usually caused by Epstein-Barr virus and most often affects adolescents and young adults 15 to 24 years of age. Primary transmission is through close personal contact with a person who is infected, particularly their saliva. Cost-effective, efficient initial laboratory testing for acute infectious mononucleosis includes complete blood count with differential (to assess for greater than 40% lymphocytes and greater than 10% atypical lymphocytes) and a rapid heterophile antibody test. The heterophile antibody test has a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 91% but can have a false-negative result in children younger than five years and in adults during the first week of illness. The presence of elevated liver enzymes increases clinical suspicion for infectious mononucleosis in the setting of a negative heterophile antibody test result. Epstein-Barr viral capsid antigen-antibody testing is more sensitive and specific but more expensive and takes longer to process than the rapid heterophile antibody test. Treatment of infectious mononucleosis is supportive; routine use of antivirals and corticosteroids is not recommended. Current guidelines recommend that patients with infectious mononucleosis not participate in athletic activity for three weeks from onset of symptoms. Shared decision-making should be used to determine the timing of return to activity. Immunosuppressed populations are at higher risk of severe disease and significant morbidity. Epstein-Barr virus infection has been linked to nine types of cancer, including Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and some autoimmune diseases.

Compared to B-ALL, T-ALL generally presents at older ages, is more often male (3:1 male:female predominance), and more often has higher white blood cell (WBC) counts and extramedullary disease including lymphadenopathy, mediastinal mass, and CNS involvement. Mediastinal mass is present in > 50% of patients with T-ALL and can compress adjacent organs causing dyspnea/airway obstruction and venous obstruction/facial edema/thrombosis; pleural and cardiac effusions can also be seen.

### Management guidelines for children with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^114g87ii]. Thyroid (2015). Medium credibility.

Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) in children — preoperative evaluation prioritizes comprehensive ultrasound to optimize surgical planning: In all cases, a comprehensive neck US using a high-resolution probe (7.5 MHz or higher) and Doppler technique should be obtained by an experienced ultrasonographer, and all regions of the neck should be interrogated. A complete US examination should be performed prior to surgery if it was not performed with the FNA, with the goal to identify locoregional metastatic disease otherwise not appreciated on physical examination. US has decreased sensitivity to identify malignant lymphadenopathy in the central neck (level VI), and in patients with large or fixed thyroid masses or bulky metastatic lymphadenopathy, US may be less sensitive at detecting metastatic disease to deep tissue regions, such as the superior mediastinum (level VII), the retropharyngeal, parapharyngeal, and subclavicular spaces. Given the very high rate of cervical lymph node metastases in children with PTC, the preoperative identification of suspicious lymph nodes affords the surgeon an opportunity to more thoughtfully plan comprehensive, compartment-oriented, lymph node dissection during the initial surgery with the intent to decrease recurrence rates and the need for additional surgery.

### Rheumatic symptoms in childhood leukaemia and lymphoma-a ten-year retrospective study [^116aU3Um]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Awareness of the possibility of a haematologic malignancy, such as leukaemia, in a child presenting with musculoskeletal complaints is essential. This is especially important when the signs and complaints are not typical of the paediatric rheumatologic and musculoskeletal diseases and syndromes, e.g. juvenile idiopathic arthritis, growing pains and hypermobile joints. The most frequent signs of malignancies presenting with a musculoskeletal presentation are migratory bone and joint pain with variable intensity and limping without significant physical findings. These children often are febrile and have elevated inflammatory laboratory markers such as the ESR and CRP. In our patients, we found the following signs useful to suggest a haematologic malignancy in children experiencing musculoskeletal and rheumatologic symptoms: pain disproportionate to the physical findings, lack of morning stiffness typical of arthritis, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, and a LDH 2–5 times the normal range of LDH.

If malignancy is strongly suspected, a definitive diagnosis should be made by a bone marrow biopsy, as blasts are often not present on the peripheral smear of the CBC. Malignancy should be eliminated as a possibility before the introduction of steroid or immunosuppressive therapy for an arthritis disease.

### Malignancy in adults with inborn errors of immunity: a retrospective single-center study [^115bokUr]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

The intersection of malignancies and immune deficiencies presents significant challenges in clinical practice. For instance, lymphoma may represent the initial manifestation of IEI in approximately 10% of cases, though this figure is likely an underestimate. Our study revealed that more than half of the patients were diagnosed with malignancies prior to the formal diagnosis of IEI. Furthermore, the age at which IEI symptoms began was significantly younger than the age at which neoplasia was diagnosed. This discrepancy suggests that lymphoma could be an early indicator of IEI or that IEI diagnosis is often delayed. Consequently, if a clinician focuses solely on malignancy during the initial evaluation, there is a risk of overlooking an underlying IEI. Indeed, approximately one-quarter of our patients had their immunoglobulin levels assessed prior to the diagnosis and treatment of malignancy. This oversight can complicate the diagnosis of IEI due to factors such as the malignancy itself, its treatment (e.g. chemotherapy, radiotherapy, splenectomy, or bone marrow ablation prior to transplantation), hospitalization, or nutritional deficiencies, which may contribute to SID. As a result, 32% of the patients had already been evaluated as having SID and received immunoglobulin replacement therapy before being referred to us. Many patients were referred to us due to lack of immune reconstitution or severe recurrent infections during malignancy follow-up. Therefore, in patients diagnosed with hematologic malignancies, particularly those presenting at a young age, with atypical anatomical localization, and at an advanced stage upon diagnosis of NHL, it is crucial to conduct a comprehensive evaluation before initiating treatment. This evaluation should include a thorough review of the patient's medical history, including recurrent or severe infections, multiple autoimmune manifestations such as early-onset, treatment-resistant, and relapsing autoimmune cytopenias, and family health history (such as a history of immunodeficiency, consanguinity, or early sudden death). Additionally, a detailed physical examination (to check for dysmorphic features, hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy) and essential biochemical assessments, including complete blood count, serum immunoglobulin levels, and both the serum free kappa and lambda light chain levels as well as their ratio, can provide critical clues for diagnosing IEI. In cases where IEI is suspected, it is essential to collaborate with pathologists, given the high morphological diversity of lymphoproliferative disorders associated with immunodeficiency. This variability, along with significant morphological and immunophenotypic overlaps between benign and malignant lesions, can complicate the diagnostic process and pose a risk of misclassifying lymphoproliferative diseases as lymphoma. Furthermore, clinicians should be vigilant about the potential development of SID during the course of malignancy treatment. In patients who have received immunosuppressive therapy and are considered to be in remission, persistent hypogammaglobulinemia or recurrent/opportunistic infections should prompt consideration of an underlying IEI. Early recognition of IEI not only helps avoid complications associated with IEI itself but may also necessitate modifications in the treatment and follow-up strategies for malignancy. Conclusively, an integrated approach in evaluating and managing these patients can lead to improved outcomes by addressing both the underlying immunodeficiency and the malignancy.

### A 14-year-old female with chest mass, shortness of breath, and hypertension [^11319p8h]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

A previously healthy 14-year-old girl was evaluated in the emergency department (ED) with 2 months of shortness of breath and fatigue.

Methods

She initially presented to her primary pediatrician, where a complete blood count was only significant for mild anemia, thyroid function tests were normal, and a chest x-ray revealed a chest mass. This prompted her primary pediatrician to order a computed tomography scan and refer to the ED.

Results

Her computed tomography scan confirmed a mediastinal mass versus necrotic lymphadenopathy. Her initial physical exam was unremarkable, except for hypertension. From the ED, she was admitted to the pediatric hospital medicine service. Infectious disease, oncology, and nephrology services were consulted to guide diagnostic evaluation.

Conclusions

Eventually, during her hospitalization, further history and workup led to a definitive diagnosis.

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^114WGu6w]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective Neck masses are common in adults, but often the underlying etiology is not easily identifiable. While infections cause most of the neck masses in children, most persistent neck masses in adults are neoplasms. Malignant neoplasms far exceed any other etiology of adult neck mass. Importantly, an asymptomatic neck mass may be the initial or only clinically apparent manifestation of head and neck cancer, such as squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), lymphoma, thyroid, or salivary gland cancer. Evidence suggests that a neck mass in the adult patient should be considered malignant until proven otherwise. Timely diagnosis of a neck mass due to metastatic HNSCC is paramount because delayed diagnosis directly affects tumor stage and worsens prognosis. Unfortunately, despite substantial advances in testing modalities over the last few decades, diagnostic delays are common. Currently, there is only 1 evidence-based clinical practice guideline to assist clinicians in evaluating an adult with a neck mass. Additionally, much of the available information is fragmented, disorganized, or focused on specific etiologies. In addition, although there is literature related to the diagnostic accuracy of individual tests, there is little guidance about rational sequencing of tests in the course of clinical care. This guideline strives to bring a coherent, evidence-based, multidisciplinary perspective to the evaluation of the neck mass with the intention to facilitate prompt diagnosis and enhance patient outcomes. Purpose The primary purpose of this guideline is to promote the efficient, effective, and accurate diagnostic workup of neck masses to ensure that adults with potentially malignant disease receive prompt diagnosis and intervention to optimize outcomes. Specific goals include reducing delays in diagnosis of HNSCC; promoting appropriate testing, including imaging, pathologic evaluation, and empiric medical therapies; reducing inappropriate testing; and promoting appropriate physical examination when cancer is suspected. The target patient for this guideline is anyone ≥ 18 years old with a neck mass. The target clinician for this guideline is anyone who may be the first clinician whom a patient with a neck mass encounters. This includes clinicians in primary care, dentistry, and emergency medicine, as well as pathologists and radiologists who have a role in diagnosing neck masses. This guideline does not apply to children. This guideline addresses the initial broad differential diagnosis of a neck mass in an adult. However, the intention is only to assist the clinician with a basic understanding of the broad array of possible entities. The intention is not to direct management of a neck mass known to originate from thyroid, salivary gland, mandibular, or dental pathology as management recommendations for these etiologies already exist. This guideline also does not address the subsequent management of specific pathologic entities, as treatment recommendations for benign and malignant neck masses can be found elsewhere. Instead, this guideline is restricted to addressing the appropriate work-up of an adult patient with a neck mass that may be malignant in order to expedite diagnosis and referral to a head and neck cancer specialist. The Guideline Development Group sought to craft a set of actionable statements relevant to diagnostic decisions made by a clinician in the workup of an adult patient with a neck mass. Furthermore, where possible, the Guideline Development Group incorporated evidence to promote high-quality and cost-effective care. Action Statements The development group made a strong recommendation that clinicians should order a neck computed tomography (or magnetic resonance imaging) with contrast for patients with a neck mass deemed at increased risk for malignancy. The development group made the following recommendations: (1) Clinicians should identify patients with a neck mass who are at increased risk for malignancy because the patient lacks a history of infectious etiology and the mass has been present for ≥ 2 weeks without significant fluctuation or the mass is of uncertain duration. (2) Clinicians should identify patients with a neck mass who are at increased risk for malignancy based on ≥ 1 of these physical examination characteristics: fixation to adjacent tissues, firm consistency, size > 1.5 cm, or ulceration of overlying skin. (3) Clinicians should conduct an initial history and physical examination for patients with a neck mass to identify those with other suspicious findings that represent an increased risk for malignancy. (4) For patients with a neck mass who are not at increased risk for malignancy, clinicians or their designees should advise patients of criteria that would trigger the need for additional evaluation. Clinicians or their designees should also document a plan for follow-up to assess resolution or final diagnosis. (5) For patients with a neck mass who are deemed at increased risk for malignancy, clinicians or their designees should explain to the patient the significance of being at increased risk and explain any recommended diagnostic tests. (6) Clinicians should perform, or refer the patient to a clinician who can perform, a targeted physical examination (including visualizing the mucosa of the larynx, base of tongue, and pharynx) for patients with a neck mass deemed at increased risk for malignancy. (7) Clinicians should perform fine-needle aspiration (FNA) instead of open biopsy, or refer the patient to someone who can perform FNA, for patients with a neck mass deemed at increased risk for malignancy when the diagnosis of the neck mass remains uncertain. (8) For patients with a neck mass deemed at increased risk for malignancy, clinicians should continue evaluation of patients with a cystic neck mass, as determined by FNA or imaging studies, until a diagnosis is obtained and should not assume that the mass is benign. (9) Clinicians should obtain additional ancillary tests based on the patient's history and physical examination when a patient with a neck mass is deemed at increased risk for malignancy who does not have a diagnosis after FNA and imaging. (10) Clinicians should recommend evaluation of the upper aerodigestive tract under anesthesia, before open biopsy, for patients with a neck mass deemed at increased risk for malignancy and without a diagnosis or primary site identified with FNA, imaging, and/or ancillary tests. The development group recommended against clinicians routinely prescribing antibiotic therapy for patients with a neck mass unless there are signs and symptoms of bacterial infection.

### Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in children and adolescents [^113GXvoj]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Workup and staging

Initial workup for HSTCL includes a comprehensive history and physical examination, with particular attention to liver and spleen size. Routine laboratory studies should include a complete blood count with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel (with particular attention paid to liver function tests), serum uric acid, and lactate dehydrogenase levels. Patients usually present with signs and symptoms of systemic inflammation; therefore, trending erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ferritin, and C-reactive protein are reasonable. As stated earlier, screening for immunosuppression, immune dysregulation, and IEIs is recommended.

In terms of imaging, contrast-enhanced CT and PET/CT scans are commonly used to evaluate whole-body metabolic and morphologic presence of disease, similar to children and adolescents with other NHL (Figure 2). Use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and PET/MRI have also been described; however, similar to other lymphomas, they are recommended as alternative or adjunctive imaging modalities due to the superior sensitivity and specificity of CT and CT/PET in detecting both nodal and extranodal disease. CT and PET/CT each have pros and cons.CT scans can miss extranodal disease, particularly relevant for HSTCL. PET/CT scans have not been studied as extensively in pediatric NHL compared with adults and other malignancies and may be inadequate for response assessment alone. CTs usually show an enlarged liver and spleen without discrete lesions, whereas PET/CT may show avidity in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow.

### Distinguishing benign mediastinal masses from malignancy in a histoplasmosis-endemic region [^116gMVqk]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the characteristics of benign and malignant mediastinal masses, which may predict their etiology and facilitate the safe and timely management of patients, especially those residing in histoplasmosis-endemic regions.

Study Design

We conducted a retrospective review of the health records of 131 patients aged < 19 years who were referred to 2 tertiary care children's hospitals between 2005 and 2010 for evaluation of mediastinal masses.

Results

Most patients (79%) had benign masses, including 98 with confirmed or suspected histoplasmosis. Overall, compared with patients with malignant masses, patients with benign masses were younger and more likely to be African American, to complain of cough, and to have pulmonary nodules by chest computed tomography. In addition, patients with malignant disease were more likely to complain of malaise and to have neck swelling, abnormal extrathoracic lymphadenopathy, lymphopenia, anterior mediastinal involvement, and/or pleural effusion. Positive histoplasmosis serologic tests were specific but insensitive for a benign etiology. No single clinical, laboratory, or radiologic feature was sufficiently sensitive and specific for distinguishing between benign and malignant masses; however, the presence of lymphopenia, anterior mediastinal involvement, or enlarged cervical lymph nodes on computed tomography had a sensitivity of 93%, specificity of 95%, positive predictive value of 86%, and negative predictive value of 97% for cancer. Sixty-four patients (49%) underwent invasive testing, including 37 (36%) of those with benign masses.

Conclusion

Patients in this series who had involvement of the anterior mediastinum, lymphopenia, or enlarged cervical lymph nodes had a high likelihood of cancer. Expectant management of patients lacking these characteristics may be safe and reduce unnecessary invasive testing.

### Evaluation and management of neck masses in children [^1169ZRzn]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Neck masses in children usually fall into one of three categories: developmental, inflammatory/reactive, or neoplastic. Common congenital developmental masses in the neck include thyroglossal duct cysts, branchial cleft cysts, dermoid cysts, vascular malformations, and hemangiomas. Inflammatory neck masses can be the result of reactive lymphadenopathy, infectious lymphadenitis (viral, staphylococcal, and mycobacterial infections; cat-scratch disease), or Kawasaki disease. Common benign neoplastic lesions include pilomatrixomas, lipomas, fibromas, neurofibromas, and salivary gland tumors. Although rare in children, malignant lesions occurring in the neck include lymphoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, thyroid carcinoma, and metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Workup for a neck mass may include a complete blood count; purified protein derivative test for tuberculosis; and measurement of titers for Epstein-Barr virus, cat-scratch disease, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus, and toxoplasmosis if the history raises suspicion for any of these conditions. Ultrasonography is the preferred imaging study for a developmental or palpable mass. Computed tomography with intravenous contrast media is recommended for evaluating a malignancy or a suspected retropharyngeal or deep neck abscess. Congenital neck masses are excised to prevent potential growth and secondary infection of the lesion. Antibiotic therapy for suspected bacterial lymphadenitis should target Staphylococcus aureus and group A streptococcus. Lack of response to initial antibiotics should prompt consideration of intravenous antibiotic therapy, referral for possible incision and drainage, or further workup. If malignancy is suspected (accompanying type B symptoms; hard, firm, or rubbery consistency; fixed mass; supraclavicular mass; lymph node larger than 2 cm in diameter; persistent enlargement for more than two weeks; no decrease in size after four to six weeks; absence of inflammation; ulceration; failure to respond to antibiotic therapy; or a thyroid mass), the patient should be referred to a head and neck surgeon for urgent evaluation and possible biopsy.

OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article is to review important imaging and clinical features to help elucidate causes of lymphadenopathy in patients with HIV infection. CONCLUSION. HIV lymphadenopathy has various causes generally categorized as inflammatory or reactive, such as immune reconstitution syndrome; infectious, such as tuberculous and nontuberculous mycobacterial infections and HIV infection itself; and neoplastic, such as lymphoma, Kaposi sarcoma, and Castleman disease. It is important to consider patients' demographic characteristics, clinical presentations, CD4 lymphocyte counts, and radiologic features to identify likely causes of lymphadenopathy.

Castleman disease initial workup — Initial workup should include a physical examination with attention to node-bearing areas, liver, and spleen and evaluation of performance status. Laboratory assessments should include standard blood work including complete blood count (CBC) with differential and a comprehensive metabolic panel, and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) should be measured. Serum protein electrophoresis should be evaluated if there is concern for POEMS syndrome, and pregnancy testing should be done in patients of childbearing potential if chemotherapy or radiation therapy is planned. PET/CT scan (preferred) or a chest/abdomen/pelvis CT with contrast of diagnostic quality are recommended as part of an initial diagnostic workup to confirm extent of disease and total nodal involvement.

However, lateral neck dissection should be performed on patients with cytologic evidence of metastases to the lateral neck, and measurement of Tg in the FNA washout can be considered if the cytological diagnosis is equivocal; consistent with this, FNA to confirm metastasis should be performed prior to lateral neck dissection and Tg measurement in the FNA washout fluid may be used to confirm equivocal cytology even with TgAb present.

Methods

Subjects

We retrospectively reviewed records of children treated between January 2018 and May 2023 at Children's Hospital Affiliated to Zhengzhou University who met the following diagnostic criteria for HNL: (1) Systemic symptoms or physical findings suggestive of HNL; (2) Histopathological confirmation of HNL by lymph node biopsy; (3) Exclusion of any other causes of lymphadenopathy. Recurrence was defined as additional episodes of febrile lymphadenopathy before or after the pathological diagnosis, excluding those due to infection, malignancy, or other definite etiologies. The study was performed in line with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of Children's Hospital Affiliated to Zhengzhou University (2023-K-070).

Clinical evaluation

We collected clinical data from all enrolled patients. This included demographic information, as well as clinical manifestations such as main symptoms (fever, headache, rash, joint pain, and oral ulcer), physical findings (lymph node enlargement, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly), complications, treatments, and outcomes. Laboratory examinations included complete blood count (CBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), liver function tests, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), serum ferritin (SF), anti-streptolysin O (ASO), lymphocyte subsets, and autoantibodies. We performed lumbar puncture and bone marrow aspiration to assist in diagnosing aseptic meningitis and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), respectively, and to rule out other causes of fever and lymphadenopathy. We recorded the size and number of the biopsied lymph nodes, the pathological results, and the recurrence status by reviewing the electronic medical records and by telephone follow-up.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 22.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). The data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median (interquartile range, IQR) according to the distribution unless otherwise specified. The independent sample t-test was used for continuous variables, and the χ2 test (Yates correction) was used for categorical characteristics. If the data could not be transformed to approach normal distribution, a Mann-Whitney U test was applied. Binary logistic regression analysis was employed to evaluate recurrence predictors of HNL. A P value of less than 0.05 (two-tailed) was considered statistically significant.

### The limping child: a systematic approach to diagnosis [^111tYwFP]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Deviations from a normal age-appropriate gait pattern can be caused by a wide variety of conditions. In most children, limping is caused by a mild, self-limiting event, such as a contusion, strain, or sprain. In some cases, however, a limp can be a sign of a serious or even life-threatening condition. Delays in diagnosis and treatment can result in significant morbidity and mortality. Examination of a limping child should begin with a thorough history, focusing on the presence of pain, any history of trauma, and any associated systemic symptoms. The presence of fever, night sweats, weight loss, and anorexia suggests the possibility of infection, inflammation, or malignancy. Physical examination should focus on identifying the type of limp and localizing the site of pathology by direct palpation and by examining the range of motion of individual joints. Localized tenderness may indicate contusions, fractures, osteomyelitis, or malignancy. A palpable mass raises the concern of malignancy. The child should be carefully examined because non-musculoskeletal conditions can cause limping. Based on the most probable diagnoses suggested by the history and physical examination, the appropriate use of laboratory tests and imaging studies can help confirm the diagnosis.

### Hematologic malignancies in pregnancy [^115USSvC]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Hematologic malignancies complicating pregnancy are uncommon, but a delay in diagnosis or treatment can mean the difference between life and death. It is the responsibility of the obstetrician, nurse-midwife, or nurse practitioner to maintain a high index of suspicion when patients present with unexplained lymphadenopathy or protracted constitutional symptoms. Management of these patients requires a multifaceted team from the oncology, pediatrics, and obstetrics services. With most hematologic cancers now requiring multiagent chemotherapy for optimal survival, the patient, her family, and her physicians are often faced with what seems to be a Faustian dilemma. Most infants exposed in utero to multiagent chemotherapy, however, seem to suffer no long-term detrimental consequences.

Pediatric aggressive mature B-cell lymphomas — clinical presentation includes painless regional or diffuse lymphadenopathy in the head/neck and inguinal region, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and B symptoms; extranodal involvement is common, and abdominal, intrathoracic, and head/neck masses produce location-specific symptoms. Central nervous system involvement can cause bladder or bowel dysfunction, lower extremity weakness, and/or headaches, and oncologic emergencies from rapid tumor growth such as tumor lysis syndrome, superior vena cava syndrome, spinal cord compression, and respiratory distress due to airway compression may prompt initial presentation.

### Normal mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes in children on multi-detector row chest computed tomography [^111bp8cn]. European Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

In conclusion, when evaluating lymph nodes in the paediatric chest on multi-detector CT one has to realise that lymph nodes are common at many mediastinal and hilar locations and that the size of normal lymph nodes is, not surprisingly, smaller in young children than that quoted for adolescents and adults. This may aid the diagnosis of lymphadenopathy in childhood.

### Immunodeficiencies in adults: key considerations for diagnosis and management [^111WMqfy]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Workup for Suspected Immunodeficiency

When immunodeficiency is clinically suspected, investigations should begin with a detailed patient history and thorough physical examination. The history should assess recurrent, severe, or unusual infections, the age of onset, response to antibiotics or prophylactic treatments, and any history of chronic inflammatory, autoimmune, or allergic manifestations. A family history suggestive of IEI, the presence of comorbidities that could lead to SID, past and current medications, and prior immune evaluations must be reviewed. Finally, vaccination records and symptoms suggestive of hematologic malignancies or other occult neoplasia should be assessed. Physical examination should look for signs of chronic infections, autoimmune disorders, or systemic immune dysfunction, including splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, malnutrition, signs of chronic lung or gastrointestinal diseases and skin abnormalities.

Investigations should be completed with a laboratory workup. A reasonable, two-step approach is described in Table 3.

Table 3
Laboratory workup for clinically suspected immunodeficiency

Additional autoimmunity testing (e.g. Antinuclear Antibody (ANA), Extractable Nuclear Antigen (ENA)) can be considered when clinical suspicion of immune dysregulation exists but is not part of the systematic first-line evaluation

IgG subclasses interpretation requires correlation with clinical findings and vaccine-specific antibody responses

CRP C-reactive protein, ESR erythrocyte sedimentation rate, TSH Thyroid Stimulating Hormone, HbA1c glycated hemoglobin, CD cluster of differentiation, NK natural killer

a Repeat testing 4–6 weeks after acute infection

CC On a case-by-case basis

The first step, which can be conducted by a primary care physician, includes the evaluation of secondary causes, as well as of a full blood count and total serum immunoglobulin levels. Step two includes a more in-depth evaluation of cellular and humoral immunity, as well as the complement activity. This step should ideally be interpreted by an immunologist or immunodeficiency specialist. Investigations are tailored to each case and may include IgG subclass analysis, lymphocyte proliferation assay, neutrophil function test, and genetic screening. In specific situations, baseline lung functions and chest CT imaging should be considered to evaluate for interstitial lung disease, bronchiectasis, or thymoma.

Abnormal quantitative results for serum immunoglobulins or blood cell count may transiently occur during acute infection. Therefore, it is generally recommended to wait 4 to 6 weeks after the resolution of last acute infection before performing an immunodeficiency assessment. An unremarkable baseline biological workup does not exclude an underlying immunodeficiency, particularly in patients suffering from recurrent, severe, or unusual infections. If clinical suspicion remains high despite normal initial results, referral to an immunology specialist for further evaluation and long-term follow-up is warranted.

### Lymphadenopathy: differential diagnosis and evaluation… [^111wbXA4]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

The cause of lymphadenopathy is often obvious: for example, the child who presents with a sore throat, tender cervical nodes and a positive rapid strep test, or the patient who presents with an infection of the hand and axillary lymphadenopathy. In other cases, the diagnosis is less clear. Lymphadenopathy may be the only clinical finding or one of several nonspecific findings, and the discovery of swollen lymph nodes will often raise the specter of serious illness such as lymphoma, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or metastatic cancer. This low prevalence of malignancy is supported by the results of two case series 2, 3 from family practice departments in the United States, in which none of 80 patients and three of 238 patients with unexplained lymphadenopathy were diagnosed with malignancy. In contrast, the prevalence of malignancy in lymph node biopsies performed in referral centers is 40 to 60 percent, 5 a statistic that has made its way into many textbooks. A subset of patients will either have unexplained lymphadenopathy after the initial clinical evaluation or have a presumptive diagnosis that is made in the "diagnostic" or "suggestive" branches of the algorithm and is not confirmed by test results or by the clinical course. In patients with unexplained localized lymphadenopathy and a reassuring clinical picture, a three- to four-week period of observation is appropriate before biopsy. Patients with localized lymphadenopathy and a worrisome clinical picture or patients with generalized lymphadenopathy will need further diagnostic evaluation that often includes biopsy were predictive of granulomatous diseases or cancer. 11 These studies were performed in referral centers, and conclusions may not apply in primary care settings. Supraclavicular lymphadenopathy has the highest risk of malignancy, estimated as 90 percent in patients older than 40 years and 25 percent in those younger than age 40.

### When is lymph node biopsy indicated in children with enlarged peripheral nodes? [^114ydMHp]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

To better define the indications for diagnostic biopsy, 239 children who underwent peripheral lymph node biopsy were reviewed. The duration of the lymphadenopathy by history, the consistency of the lymph nodes, and the presence of more than one site of palpable adenopathy were not specific in differentiating serious diseases involving lymph nodes from reactive hyperplasia. The differential diagnosis of specific causes for lymph node enlargement is approached based on the child's age, the location of the adenopathy, and the presence or absence of lymph node fixation and tenderness. Most children with supraclavicular adenopathy, children sick with fever of one week's duration or with weight loss for which a specific diagnosis is not readily made, and some children with fixation of the lymph node to the overlying skin should undergo early biopsy.

Excluding the above findings, when a specific diagnosis is not apparent, serial measurements with a ruler over several weeks appears to be the most reasonable method, at the present time, of discriminating hyperplastic lymph nodes from nodes that are involved by a progressive disease process.
