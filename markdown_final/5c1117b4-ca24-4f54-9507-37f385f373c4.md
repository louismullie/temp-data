## Question

differential for tooth pain, and facial swelling, post dental procedure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis and evaluation of tooth pain with facial swelling after a recent dental procedure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about anchoring features in the history: procedure type, timing of onset, location, severity, and systemic risk factors. Then, I should categorize etiologies by pathophysiology into infectious‑inflammatory versus iatrogenic/traumatic versus late complications such as osteomyelitis, MRONJ, or ORN. Next, I will identify red flags mandating urgent escalation. After that, I need to outline bedside evaluation, imaging, and initial management including antibiotic stewardship and source control. Finally, I should consider procedure‑specific entities like dry socket, subcutaneous emphysema, sodium hypochlorite accidents, pericoronitis, and odontogenic sinusitis, and close with patient counseling and follow‑up priorities [^116FwXQ6] [^11333evY] [^117R6kXZ] [^114W6qbP] [^114ZMqH9].

> Let me first confirm the anchoring questions that narrow the differential quickly: what dental work was done (extraction, root canal, implant, periodontal surgery, air‑driven handpiece), when symptoms began relative to the procedure (immediate hours vs 1–3 days vs > 5 days vs weeks), where the pain and swelling localize (tooth‑specific vs diffuse), how severe and "hot" the swelling is, and whether systemic or airway signs exist; I should also check risk factors such as diabetes, immunosuppression, recent head‑neck radiotherapy, or antiresorptive/antiangiogenic therapy because they pivot the pretest probabilities toward severe infections, MRONJ, or ORN, and I should not forget recent COVID‑19 exposure given reported links to mucormycosis, although rare, in the right host milieu [^116FwXQ6] [^114W6qbP] [^114ZMqH9] [^112QGHnm].

> Now, I will consider immediate (< 24 hours) post‑procedure causes before jumping to infection; subcutaneous cervicofacial emphysema presents abruptly with painless or mildly painful "puffy" swelling and palpable crepitus after air‑driven devices force air into fascial planes — CT shows air tracking and management is usually observation unless airway threatens; by contrast, a tense, firm, often bluish swelling suggests a hematoma, more likely on anticoagulants or coagulopathy; finally, after endodontic irrigation, a sodium hypochlorite extrusion causes sudden severe pain, ecchymosis, and swelling within hours — steroids, analgesia, and close follow‑up are typical while ruling out compartmental complications [^112QqEcV] [^113mNm9N] [^1114AiEN] [^111rq2di] [^111bPAiG].

> Next, I will examine early infectious presentations (1–3 days) where an acute odontogenic abscess or periapical infection produces focal throbbing tooth pain with tender, warm erythematous swelling that can evolve into cellulitis; I need to ensure I do not miss rapid spread into submandibular or masticator spaces, because trismus, dysphagia, drooling, or dyspnea raise concern for deep‑space infection including Ludwig's angina and mandate urgent imaging, airway readiness, and maxillofacial input [^113bNp7S] [^116AymLc].

> Wait, let me verify the timing and phenotype of dry socket; alveolar osteitis classically manifests 1–3 days after extraction with severe, radiating pain "out of proportion" to the local exam, a socket devoid of clot, malodor, and importantly minimal or no soft‑tissue swelling — hold on, I initially almost attributed "swelling" here, but that would be misleading; the hallmark is pain with scant edema, so management is local irrigation and medicated dressing plus analgesia rather than systemic antibiotics unless there is secondary infection [^11333evY] [^114bgfSE].

> I should also consider pericoronitis around a partially erupted third molar or around a recent surgical site; localized tender swelling over the operculum with pain on mastication and possible purulence fits, and while irrigation and local measures are primary, I need to track for progression to secondary cellulitis if pain and trismus escalate [^116FwXQ6].

> Let me think about odontogenic maxillary sinusitis after upper molar procedures or sinus exposure; facial pressure worse with forward bending, nasal congestion, and post‑nasal drip after an extraction or implant breach point to sinus involvement rather than primary dental sepsis, and ENT or dental collaboration with imaging is often needed to guide drainage and antibiotics plus closure of any oroantral communication [^116FwXQ6].

> For delayed courses (≥ 5 days to weeks), I need to check for acute or subacute osteomyelitis in patients with persistent deep pain, swelling, sinus tract, or systemic features — mandible is more often involved, and ill‑defined lytic changes on imaging support the diagnosis; in diabetics or the severely immunocompromised, I must keep invasive mucormycosis on the radar if necrotic tissue, foul discharge, and rapid progression occur, particularly with prior COVID‑19; weeks to months after extraction in patients on antiresorptives or antiangiogenics, MRONJ presents with non‑healing exposed bone that may be initially painless and later infected, and prior head‑neck radiotherapy shifts concern toward ORN rather than MRONJ [^114XgcMn] [^112QGHnm] [^114W6qbP] [^114ZMqH9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without screening red flags; red flags demanding urgent OMFS/ENT evaluation and possible airway management include fever with rapidly spreading, indurated swelling, trismus, dysphagia, drooling, dyspnea, tongue elevation, floor‑of‑mouth induration, toxic appearance, and immunocompromise; orbital pain, ophthalmoplegia, proptosis, or visual changes imply orbital extension with vision‑threatening complications and require emergent imaging and drainage alongside broad antimicrobial coverage [^116AymLc] [^114y8foB].

> I will now examine the diagnostic work‑up; at the bedside, I should confirm the offending tooth, check for fluctuance or crepitus, inspect extraction sockets for clot loss, and palpate fascial spaces while tracking vitals and airway; if deep‑space infection or emphysema is suspected, contrast‑enhanced CT of the face/neck delineates fluid collections or air tracking, while panoramic or periapical radiographs help identify periapical pathology or implant/sinus breaches, and CT can define osteomyelitis extent when clinically suspected [^113mNm9N] [^117WKw6h] [^114XgcMn].

> I need to ensure antibiotic stewardship and prioritize source control; for symptomatic apical periodontitis or localized acute apical abscess without systemic spread, definitive dental treatment (incision and drainage, pulpal therapy, or extraction) is first‑line and systemic antibiotics are not routinely indicated; antibiotics are reserved for diffuse swelling, cellulitis, lymphadenitis, or systemic signs such as fever or malaise, where they are used alongside timely drainage or extraction to avoid progression [^117R6kXZ] [^113DW4FB].

> Next, I should review condition‑specific management pivots; dry socket requires local irrigation, medicated dressings, and analgesia rather than antibiotics, pericoronitis improves with irrigation and debridement plus escalation if cellulitis develops, and odontogenic sinusitis often needs combined dental and sinus management to clear the source and close any communication; education and well‑delivered postoperative instructions can meaningfully reduce pain and improve satisfaction, which I should not overlook in discharge planning [^11333evY] [^116DrWcy] [^111bDuhD].

> Let me reconsider iatrogenic entities and their management so I don't miss subtle cues; subcutaneous emphysema generally warrants observation, oxygen, avoidance of Valsalva, and return precautions unless airway compromise or mediastinal extension emerges, hematomas require pressure, factor correction when coagulopathy is present, and occasional drainage if compromising, and sodium hypochlorite accidents call for cold compresses, analgesia, short‑course steroids, and close review while excluding necrotizing sequelae; counseling to avoid straws or forceful rinsing after extractions helps prevent patient‑induced emphysema [^115mbts1] [^111rq2di] [^111bPAiG] [^116zUM8o].

> I should double‑check late complications tied to prior treatments; with suspected MRONJ, I must document antiresorptive or antiangiogenic exposure, look for exposed bone and fistulae, and favor conservative local care with antiseptic rinses and targeted antibiotics when secondarily infected while coordinating with oral surgery; in head‑neck radiotherapy survivors, ORN prevention does not routinely include prophylactic hyperbaric oxygen before extractions per contemporary guidelines, and conservative measures or staged debridement are individualized when ORN arises [^114W6qbP] [^115mhcWU] [^112dixzq].

> But wait, what if the clinical picture is pain out of proportion without obvious swelling and no focal dentoalveolar source; in that scenario I should keep non‑odontogenic causes such as trigeminal neuralgia or other facial pain syndromes in mind to avoid unnecessary dental procedures, particularly if shocks of pain are triggered by light touch and respond to carbamazepine, though this is less likely in the immediate post‑procedural window and should be a diagnosis of exclusion here [^1126w4BW] [^111LZfvf].

> Finally, I will synthesize a quick time‑course heuristic to guide disposition while I confirm details with the patient: immediate "puffy with crepitus" swelling suggests emphysema; firm tense bluish swelling suggests hematoma; within 1–3 days, focal hot swelling implies abscess/cellulitis whereas severe radiating pain with a dry socket implies alveolar osteitis; beyond 5 days, persistent deep pain with sinus tracts suggests osteomyelitis, and non‑healing exposed bone in patients on antiresorptives or post‑RT suggests MRONJ/ORN; at every step, I need to screen for airway or orbital red flags and escalate urgently when present [^1114AiEN] [^111rq2di] [^113bNp7S] [^11333evY] [^114XgcMn] [^114W6qbP] [^114ZMqH9] [^116AymLc].

The differential for tooth pain and facial swelling following a dental procedure includes **odontogenic infections** (periapical/periodontal abscess, cellulitis, osteomyelitis) [^113bNp7S], **alveolar osteitis (dry socket)** [^11333evY], and **subcutaneous emphysema** from air-driven instruments [^112QqEcV]. Other causes include **iatrogenic nerve injury** (inferior alveolar/lingual) [^116MWb3V], medication-related osteonecrosis (bisphosphonates, denosumab) [^114W6qbP], allergic reactions, hematoma, and rare entities such as necrotizing fasciitis [^116AymLc] or mucormycosis in immunocompromised patients [^112QGHnm]. Evaluation should include a **focused history, exam, and imaging** (panoramic radiograph or CT) [^117WKw6h] to identify the cause and guide management [^117WKw6h].

## Infectious complications

### Odontogenic infections

- **Periapical abscess**: Infection at the tooth apex, often from pulp necrosis or failed endodontics; presents with localized pain, swelling, erythema, and possible systemic signs [^113bNp7S].

- **Periodontal abscess**: Infection of periodontal tissues, typically with deep pockets or advanced periodontitis; presents with localized pain, swelling, and erythema [^116VzPDR].

- **Cellulitis**: Diffuse soft-tissue infection with swelling, erythema, warmth, and systemic signs; can spread to deep spaces and cause severe complications [^116AymLc].

- **Osteomyelitis**: Infection of jaw bone, more common in the mandible; presents with pain, swelling, fever, and possible paresthesia or pathological fracture [^114XgcMn].

---

### Alveolar osteitis (dry socket)

Alveolar osteitis (dry socket) is common after extractions — especially mandibular molars [^114W3UPp] — and typically presents **2–3 days post-op with severe pain, exposed bone**, halitosis, and localized swelling [^11333evY].

---

### Subcutaneous emphysema

Subcutaneous emphysema involves **air in the soft tissues** from air-driven instruments [^1114AiEN] and presents with **sudden swelling and crepitus**, often painless or only mildly painful [^112QqEcV].

---

## Non-infectious complications

### Iatrogenic nerve injury

Iatrogenic nerve injury, typically involving the **inferior alveolar or lingual nerve** [^116MWb3V] from trauma during extraction or implant placement, presents with **pain, paresthesia, or anesthesia** in the nerve distribution.

---

### Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ)

MRONJ is associated with **bisphosphonates, denosumab, or antiangiogenic agents** [^114W6qbP] and presents with pain, swelling, **exposed bone**, and delayed healing [^115mhcWU].

---

### Allergic reactions

Allergic reactions to **local anesthetics, antibiotics, or materials** present with **swelling, erythema, and pruritus**, with possible systemic symptoms.

---

---

## Rare but serious complications

### Necrotizing fasciitis

Necrotizing fasciitis is a **rapidly progressive soft-tissue infection** characterized by **severe pain**, swelling, systemic toxicity, and rapid clinical deterioration [^116AymLc].

---

### Mucormycosis

Mucormycosis is an **invasive fungal infection**, often in **immunocompromised or diabetic patients**, presenting with pain, swelling, **necrosis**, and systemic symptoms [^112QGHnm].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **systematic approach** is essential [^112dEiLC].

- **History**: Procedure details, timing, symptoms, systemic signs, medications, comorbidities.

- **Clinical examination**: Inspect for swelling, erythema, crepitus, exposed bone, nerve deficits.

- **Imaging**: Panoramic radiograph, periapical films, or CT to assess infection, emphysema, or osteonecrosis [^117WKw6h].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, CRP, ESR for systemic infection or inflammation [^116AymLc].

---

## Management strategies

Management **depends on the diagnosis**.

- **Odontogenic infections**: Drainage, endodontic therapy or extraction, and antibiotics if spreading or systemic involvement [^117R6kXZ].

- **Dry socket**: Local irrigation, medicated dressings, analgesics [^11333evY].

- **Subcutaneous emphysema**: Observation, oxygen therapy, antibiotics if infection suspected [^115mbts1].

- **Nerve injury**: Observation, analgesics, neurology referral if persistent [^116MWb3V].

- **MRONJ**: Conservative care, antibiotics, surgical debridement if indicated [^115mhcWU].

- **Allergic reactions**: Antihistamines, corticosteroids, epinephrine if severe.

- **Hematoma**: Observation, analgesics, surgical evacuation if large [^111rq2di].

- **Necrotizing fasciitis or mucormycosis**: Urgent surgical debridement, broad-spectrum antibiotics or antifungals, critical care [^112QGHnm].

---

Tooth pain and facial swelling after dental procedures have a broad differential; **a focused history, exam, and imaging are key** to identifying the cause and guiding timely, appropriate management [^112dEiLC].

### Odontogenic orofacial infections [^113bNp7S]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Acute dental abscess is a frequent and sometimes underestimated disease of the oral cavity. It usually occurs secondary to caries, trauma, or failed endodontic treatment. After the intact pulp chamber is opened, colonization of the root canals occurs by a variable set of anaerobic bacteria, which colonize the walls of the necrotic root canals, forming a specialized mixed anaerobic biofilm. Asymptomatic necrosis is common; however, abscess formation occurs when these bacteria and their toxic products breach into the periapical tissues through the apical foramen, inducing acute inflammation and pus formation.

The main signs and symptoms of acute dental abscess, often referred to as a periapical abscess or infection, are pain, swelling, erythema, and suppuration, usually localized to the affected tooth. The abscess can eventually spread, causing a severe odontogenic infection characterized by local and systemic involvement, culminating in sepsis syndrome. The vast majority of dental abscesses respond to antibiotic treatment. However, in some patients, surgical management of the infection may be indicated.

In the present work, a retrospective analysis of the patients with dental orofacial infections referred to the Unit of Dentistry and Maxillofacial Surgery of the University of Verona from 1991 to 2011 has been performed.

### Local interventions for the management of alveolar osteitis (dry socket) [^11333evY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Alveolar osteitis, commonly known as dry socket, is a complication of dental extractions that more frequently affects mandibular molar teeth. It is characterized by severe pain developing 2 to 3 days postoperatively, with or without halitosis. Additionally, it may involve a socket that is partially or completely devoid of a blood clot, leading to increased postoperative visits. This document serves as an update to the Cochrane Review initially published in 2012. The objectives are to assess the effects of local interventions used for the prevention and treatment of alveolar osteitis following tooth extraction.

- **Search methods**: An Information Specialist searched four bibliographic databases up to 28 September 2021 and employed additional search methods to identify published, unpublished, and ongoing studies.

- **Selection criteria**: The review included randomized controlled trials involving adults over 18 years of age who were undergoing permanent tooth extraction or had developed dry socket postextraction. Studies included any type of local intervention used for the prevention or treatment of dry socket, compared against a different local intervention, placebo, or no treatment. Studies reporting on the systemic use of antibiotics or surgical techniques were excluded, as these interventions are evaluated in separate Cochrane Reviews.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The methodologies adhered to standard procedures established by Cochrane. Statistical guidelines prescribed by Cochrane were followed, with dichotomous outcomes reported as risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) calculated using random-effects models. This applied even to split-mouth studies with sparse data, ensuring comprehensive analysis.

### Primary odontogenic onset invasive mucormycosis-an under recognized clinical entity [^112QGHnm]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Low credibility.

The primary source of facial mucormycosis is through the inhalation of fungal sporangiospores, resulting in invasive disease in paranasal sinuses. However, dental onset mucormycosis has not been well documented in literature. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with odontogenic onset mucormycosis.

From a large cohort of mucormycosis involving the face between July 2020 and October 2021, we selected patients who had dental symptoms at onset and predominant alveolar involvement with little to no paranasal sinus disease as shown by baseline imaging. All patients had a confirmed diagnosis of mucormycosis through histopathology, with or without the growth of Mucorales in fungal culture.

Out of 256 patients with invasive mucormycosis of the face, 8.2% (21 patients) had odontogenic onset. Uncontrolled diabetes was a common risk factor, affecting 71.4% (15/21) of the patients, while recent COVID-19 illness was noted in 80.9% (17/21) of patients. The median duration of symptoms at presentation was 37 days (IQR, 14–80 days). The most common symptoms were dental pain with loose teeth (100%), facial swelling (66.7% [14/21]), pus discharge (28.6% [6/21]), and gingival and palatal abscess (28.6% [6/21]). Extensive osteomyelitis was found in 61.9% (13/21) of the patients, and 28.6% (6/21) had oroantral fistulas. The mortality rate was low, at 9.5% (2/21), with only 9.5% (2/21) of the patients having brain extension and 14.2% (3/21) in the orbit.

This study suggests that odontogenic onset invasive mucormycosis is an under-recognized clinical entity with its unique characteristics and outcomes.

### Subcutaneous facial emphysema secondary to a dental procedure [^112QqEcV]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Subcutaneous emphysema is a possible but infrequent consequence of dental procedures. We present the case of a 6-year-old healthy boy transferred from a dental clinic immediately after local anaesthesia for tooth extraction, due to sudden orbital and facial swelling. On physical examination, oedema of the left upper eyelid with fine crepitus on palpation and left hemiface oedema with local pain were observed. Ophthalmologic observation was normal. A CT scan of the face and orbits documented extensive infiltration of the subcutaneous tissue planes of the left face by air, with extension to the external part of the body of the mandible, retromaxillary fat, masticatory muscle spaces, parapharyngeal space, and adjacent to the orbital roof. After completing the initial evaluation, the dentist confirmed the use of an air-driven device during local anaesthesia administration. The patient improved with conservative treatment. Early recognition of this condition is essential to provide an adequate clinical assessment with the exclusion of possible life-threatening complications.

### Systemic antibiotics for symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess in adults [^113DW4FB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Dental pain can have a considerable detrimental effect on an individual's quality of life. Symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess are common causes of dental pain and arise from an inflamed or necrotic dental pulp, or infection of the pulpless root canal system. Clinical guidelines recommend that the first-line treatment for teeth with symptomatic apical periodontitis or an acute apical abscess should be the removal of the source of inflammation or infection by local, operative measures. Systemic antibiotics are currently only recommended for situations where there is evidence of spreading infection, such as cellulitis, lymph node involvement, diffuse swelling, or systemic involvement, including fever and malaise. Despite this, there is evidence that dentists continue to prescribe antibiotics for these conditions, raising concerns about the development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial colonies both within the individual and the community.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of systemic antibiotics provided with or without surgical intervention (such as extraction, incision, and drainage of a swelling, or endodontic treatment), with or without analgesics, for symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess in adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 1 October 2013), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 9), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 1 October 2013), and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 1 October 2013).

### Brain abscess caused by Enterococcus faecalis following a dental procedure in a patient with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [^114rDiVg]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2012). Low credibility.

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a disease characterized by arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). A brain abscess is a possible complication of HHT associated with AVMs. Literature provides evidence that Enterococcus faecalis can cause endodontic infections. We present the case of an HHT patient who developed a brain abscess due to E. faecalis following a dental procedure.

### Differential diagnosis of toothache to prevent erroneous and unnecessary dental treatment [^116FwXQ6]. Journal of Oral Rehabilitation (2020). High credibility.

Dental pain can arise from various causes, necessitating accurate diagnosis to prevent unnecessary dental treatments. Potential causes include:

- **Dental and oral conditions**: dentigerous cysts, gingivitis, dental abscesses, alveolar osteitis, pulpitis, periodontitis, pericoronitis, dental caries, impacted teeth
- **Non-dental conditions**: acute sinusitis, nonodontogenic cysts, trigeminal neuralgia, temporomandibular joint disorders, herpes zoster, oral cancer, bruxism, sinusitis, osteomyelitis of the jaw, atypical odontalgia

Moreover, certain medications can also cause dental pain. These medications include:

- **Antipsychotic and antidepressant medications**: aripiprazole, aripiprazole ER, escitalopram, quetiapine, risperidone ER, bupropion hydrochloride XL, bupropion hydrochloride, bupropion hydrochloride SR, asenapine ER, quetiapine ER, olanzapine pamoate ER

### Corticosteroids or cyclooxygenase 2-selective inhibitor medication for the management of pain and swelling after third-molar surgery [^112ht6Zf]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The dental-impaction pain model is the most commonly used and widely accepted acute pain model for assessing the analgesic effect of drugs in humans. This randomized crossover clinical trial aimed to observe and compare the anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroid and nonsteroidal cyclooxygenase 2-selective inhibitor medication on pain, swelling, and trismus after third-molar surgery.

Fifty adult subjects, comprising 25 males and 25 females aged between 18 and 29 years (mean age, 22.5 years) with no local or systemic health issues and presenting bilateral impacted lower third molars in a similar position with surgical extraction indicated, were selected. Participants underwent one surgical procedure on each side, with a 3-week interval between procedures. They received either 120 mg etoricoxib, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (group 1), or 4 mg dexamethasone, a corticosteroid anti-inflammatory (group 2), one hour before the procedures.

Data were recorded at preoperative baseline and 24 and 48 hours postoperatively. Postoperative pain was evaluated using a visual analog scale, and the degree of swelling was assessed through variations in facial reference points. The presence of trismus was analyzed by measuring the interincisal distance. These assessments were conducted before the operation and at 24 and 48 hours after the surgeries.

There was no statistically significant difference between the anti-inflammatory treatments. However, at 48 hours, facial swelling increased in both groups despite a reduction in trismus. The effects of nonsteroidal and steroid treatments were comparable in terms of pain management and reduction in swelling and trismus.

### Facial pain: Clinical differential diagnosis [^114NxbaW]. The Lancet Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of facial pain as the presenting complaint can be challenging. We propose an approach based on history and neurological examination that allows for a working diagnosis to be made at the bedside, including aetiological hypotheses leading to a choice of investigations. Neuralgias are characterized by stabs of short-lasting, lancinating pain and, although they are often primary, imaging may be needed to exclude symptomatic forms.

- **Facial pain with cranial nerve symptoms and signs**: This is almost exclusively of secondary origin and requires urgent examination.
- **Facial pain with focal autonomic signs**: Mostly primary, this type belongs to the group of idiopathic trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias but can occasionally be secondary.
- **Pure facial pain**: Most often due to sinusitis and issues with the chewing apparatus, but it can also result from a multitude of other causes. The pain can also be idiopathic. Imaging and non-neurological specialist assessments are often necessary in these cases.

### American Cancer Society head and neck cancer survivorship care guideline [^112jBN15]. CA (2016). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for oropharyngeal cancer, more specifically with respect to survivorship and rehabilitation (oral and dental care), ACS 2016 guidelines recommend monitoring patients for jaw swelling or pain indicating possible osteonecrosis. Offer conservative treatment such as broad-spectrum antibiotics and daily saline or aqueous chlorhexidine gluconate irrigations for early-stage lesions. Refer patients to a head and neck surgeon for consideration of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for early and intermediate lesions, debridement of necrotic bone while undergoing conservative management, or external mandible bony exposure through the skin.

### Clinical concepts of dry socket [^114bgfSE]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Dry socket is one of the most studied complications in dentistry, with numerous studies aiming to find effective and safe methods for its prevention and treatment. A major clinical challenge since the first reported case has been the inconsistency and differences in the various definitions of dry socket and the criteria used for diagnosis. The pathophysiology, etiology, prevention, and treatment of dry socket are crucial in the practice of oral surgery. The aim of the present report was to review and discuss each aspect thoroughly.

### Management of the sodium hypochlorite accident: a rare but significant complication of root canal treatment [^111bPAiG]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

A 66-year-old female patient presented to the accident and emergency department 3 hours following a dental appointment. Significant right-sided facial swelling, bruising, and pain were present. The patient had been sent by her general dental practitioner with a covering letter explaining that a hypochlorite accident had occurred during root canal treatment of the upper right first premolar tooth. An iatrogenic perforation was suspected. The patient was admitted under the care of the maxillofacial team, and intravenous antibiotics, analgesia, and steroids were administered. The patient was prepared for the possibility of requiring surgical intervention under general anesthesia. No nerve injury was encountered, and the periorbital tissues were spared. A full recovery was made by the patient, with no surgical intervention required, but significant bruising and swelling were present up to 4 weeks following the incident.

### Osteoradionecrosis of the jaw: A mini review [^114ZMqH9]. Frontiers in Oral Health (2022). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on osteoradionecrosis of the jaw:

- **Definition**: ORNJ is a complication of radiation therapy for the head and neck, characterized by necrosis of the maxilla or mandible.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology involves radiation-induced damage to the blood vessels and bone cells in the jaw, leading to tissue hypoxia and impaired healing that ultimately results in necrosis of the bone tissue.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of osteoradionecrosis varies widely in the literature, ranging from 0.4% to 56% after radiotherapy, with a significant reduction in the modern era.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for osteoradionecrosis include high doses of radiation, poor oral hygiene and periodontal status, and dental extractions after radiotherapy. Alcohol use and smoking may also increase the risk.

- **Disease course**: The clinical course of osteoradionecrosis usually starts with pain, swelling, dysesthesia, and exposed bone in the mouth. As the condition progresses, complications can arise, including dysphagia, dysarthria, pathological fractures, fistula formation, and in severe cases, extra-mandibular osteoradionecrosis.

### Conservative management of persistent facial cutaneous sinus tract with a dental origin [^116Wa5A4]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Facial and cervical area sinus tracts can be odontogenic or non-odontogenic. Clinicians should be aware that lesions with a dental origin can be confused with dermatological lesions. We describe three cases of cutaneous lesions of dental origin that were initially misdiagnosed as being dermatological in origin. Multiple unsuccessful treatments were attempted, but the lesions failed to heal. However, conservative endodontic intervention resulted in complete resolution of the causative periapical lesions within a short period, making surgery unnecessary. Dental aetiology, as part of a differential diagnosis, must be considered in such oro-facial lesions.

### Unusual cause of tooth mobility [^112sVbUS]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

We describe a case of a 71-year-old otherwise healthy man who presented to the dental clinic with the chief complaint of mobility involving his upper left molar teeth. The patient was afebrile, and clinical oral examination revealed localized grade II mobility and absence of gingival swelling, erythema, or sinus tract. An orthopantomogram revealed a poorly defined radiolucency involving the upper left second and third molar teeth. Surgical exploration of the involved area was performed, revealing the presence of a 'jelly-like' brown tissue that fragmented easily. Pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma.

### Periodontal disease and tooth loss [^113jXMTP]. International Dental Journal (1998). High credibility.

Among other possible causes, tooth loss can be caused by Langerhans cell histiocytosis, amphetamine use disorder, facial trauma, osteogenesis imperfecta, osteoporosis, chronic periodontitis, periodontitis, dental caries, hypophosphatasia, hyperostosis corticalis deformans juvenilis, and acatalasia. In addition, tooth loss can be caused by medications such as buprenorphine/naloxone and teriflunomide.

### Oral manifestations in the post COVID-19 condition: A systematic review with meta-analysis [^113XrYew]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2025). Low credibility.

The prognosis of post-COVID-19 conditions remains unclear and is likely influenced by the severity of clinical symptoms, underlying comorbidities, and individual treatment responses. In a two-year follow-up study after COVID-19 infection, recovery of smell and taste was found to be most significant within the first 100 days post-acute phase, with little or no improvement thereafter. This suggests that the post-COVID-19 condition may become established after this period, and therapeutic interventions before the chronic phase could be more effective.

Ongoing training and continuing education for oral health professionals are essential. Training courses should address diagnostic methods, treatment, and follow-up for post-COVID-19 conditions. Given that post-COVID-19 involves a wide range of potential multisystemic manifestations, all healthcare professionals should be prepared for appropriate oral health diagnosis and timely treatment or referral. Interprofessional collaboration aims to improve care delivery, reduce healthcare system burden, and avoid resource exhaustion, which had already been under significant strain during the pandemic.

More than 50% of the studies included in this review were cohort studies, suggesting a research interest in understanding the temporal role of post-COVID-19 oral manifestations and providing methodological potential for informing symptom and condition prognosis. Longer follow-up periods may offer more information on symptom duration and disease outcomes but are subject to recall or measurement bias. Moreover, self-reported symptoms may not accurately reflect the clinical condition, emphasizing the need for ongoing research and validation.

### Differential diagnosis of facial pain and guidelines for management [^112dEiLC]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2013). High credibility.

Facial pain can have various causes, including infraorbital nerve dehiscence, trigeminal causalgia, temporomandibular joint disorders, toothache, oral ulceration, Bell's palsy, and varicella-zoster virus infection. Other causes may include eosinophilic sialadenitis, dental sepsis, sialolithiasis, trigeminal neuralgia, functional disorders, atypical odontalgia, maxillary sinus carcinoma, and olfactory esthesioneuroblastoma. Conditions like acute sinusitis, acute parotitis, temporal arteritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, posterior communicating artery aneurysm, internal carotid artery aneurysm, paroxysmal extreme pain disorder, Eagle's syndrome, and cluster headache can also lead to facial pain. Furthermore, medications such as moxifloxacin may cause facial pain.

### Chronic facial pain: a multidisciplinary problem [^113zAA2d]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Atypical facial pain is an unrecognized and unhelpful diagnosis, describing chronic pains that do not fit the present classification system. Due to the location of the pain, patients may seek and, indeed, receive treatment from dental practitioners and specialists. However, the pain is often unresponsive and may have more in common with unexplained medical symptoms affecting other areas of the body than with other dental symptoms. This review suggests the need for a diagnostic category of "chronic facial pain", which requires a multidisciplinary approach for effective diagnosis and management.

### Unusually sited lower third molar [^115XWoPV]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

We present the case of a 60-year-old woman who presented to our unit with left-sided facial swelling, pain, and trismus. Initially managed as parotitis by a different specialty, an ultrasound subsequently showed a collection deep to the parotid associated with an ectopic wisdom tooth within the mandibular posterior ramus/condyle, and the patient was referred to our department. After treating the acute infection, the wisdom tooth was surgically removed. Our case highlights the importance of the clinician maintaining an open mind to differential diagnoses and details a technique for the surgical removal of a tooth with difficult access.

### Oral manifestations in the post COVID-19 condition: A systematic review with meta-analysis [^113vNQS1]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2025). Low credibility.

Regarding the sex distribution of participants, the proportion of female participants ranged from 10% to 95.5%, with a median of 54.4% (Supporting Information S2). However, few studies provided sex-disaggregated data for specific oral symptoms, which limited the possibility of performing subgroup analyses by sex.

- **Territory**: Most surveys were conducted in Europe (55.1%), followed by the Middle East (14.0%). The regions with the fewest studies were South America (6.5%), Africa (1.8%), and the Caribbean (0.9%).

- **Study types**: It was found that cohorts were the most frequent (54.2%), followed by cross-sectional studies (32.7%). Reports and/or case series were the least frequent (13.0%). Regarding the minimum time used to define the case of post-COVID-19 condition, 12 weeks (32 studies; 29.9%) and 24 weeks (24 studies; 22.4%) stand out.

Other outcomes related to oral manifestations were identified in a smaller number of studies, which did not allow for meta-analysis. Among these manifestations, hyposalivation or dry mouth were mentioned in four studies. Tongue mucosal changes, sensitivity in the trigeminal nerve, and mouth ulcers or sore-like lesions were reported in two studies each. Facial tremors, facial muscle weakness, facial asymmetry, and changes in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) were mentioned in a single study.

Outcomes cited only once in the studies included spontaneous osteoradionecrosis.

### Patient-induced progressive facial subcutaneous emphysema masquerading as odontogenic abscess [^116zUM8o]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Facial subcutaneous emphysema (SE) is an uncommon sequelae of dental procedures, often attributed to the use of high-speed air-driven handpieces during surgical extractions, which can force air through fascial spaces. Rarely have there been documented cases of patient-induced SE. In this case report, we present an 18-year-old woman who was referred to the emergency department with a 5-day history of progressive swelling and pain in her right cheek, following a prolonged but simple extraction of tooth 18.

While the dentist and emergency physicians were concerned about an infectious etiology, history taking, clinical review, and imaging corroborated the diagnosis of patient-induced SE secondary to habitual straw use. This report highlights the need for routine post-extraction counseling of sinus precautions, irrespective of extraction complexity. Additionally, emergency physicians should be aware of SE masquerading as other pathologies, including odontogenic abscesses, allergic reactions, angioedema, and gas-forming bacterial infections, such as necrotizing fasciitis, to ensure appropriate treatment is provided to patients.

### Evenity [^1159WQbC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Osteonecrosis of the jaw**: Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), which can occur spontaneously, is generally associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing, and has been reported in patients receiving Evenity. A routine oral examination should be performed by the prescriber prior to the initiation of Evenity treatment. Concomitant administration of drugs associated with ONJ (chemotherapy, bisphosphonates, denosumab, angiogenesis inhibitors, and corticosteroids) may increase the risk of developing ONJ. Other risk factors for ONJ include cancer, radiotherapy, poor oral hygiene, pre-existing dental disease or infection, anemia, and coagulopathy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

	- For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, the clinical judgment of the treating physician and/or oral surgeon should guide the management plan of each patient based on a benefit-risk assessment. Patients who are suspected of having or who develop ONJ while on Evenity should receive care by a dentist or an oral surgeon. In these patients, dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition. Discontinuation of Evenity should be considered based on a benefit-risk assessment.

- **Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures**: Atypical low-energy or low-trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in patients receiving Evenity [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation.

### Factors affecting incidence of dry socket: A prospective community-based study [^114W3UPp]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Dry socket, or alveolar osteitis, can occur because of the removal of teeth. No clear etiology has been acknowledged; however, numerous risk factors have been proposed and tested. We report on the results of a prospective, multicenter study of the incidence and factors affecting the occurrence of alveolar osteitis at the Royal Dental Hospital of Melbourne and Community Dental Clinics in Melbourne, Australia. Ethics approval was gained from the University of Melbourne and Dental Health Services Victoria. The data were analyzed in a descriptive fashion, and the factors affecting alveolar osteitis were assessed using logistic regression analysis.

The incidence of alveolar osteitis was 2.3% of all teeth extracted, with 4.2% of all patients experiencing alveolar osteitis in a public dental setting. Multivariate analysis revealed:

- **Significant independent risk factors**:
	- Operator experience, perioperative crown and root fractures, periodontal disease, posterior teeth, and, interestingly, the use of mental health medications were identified as significant independent risk factors for the development of alveolar osteitis.

No alveolar osteitis was reported in patients taking antibiotics, the oral contraceptive pill, bisphosphonates, or oral steroid drugs. Smoking and extraction technique (either operative or nonoperative) were also not found to significantly affect the development of alveolar osteitis.

### International guidelines for the treatment of Huntington's disease [^111g6PtB]. Frontiers in Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of Huntington's disease, particularly in relation to dental pain, the EHDN 2019 guidelines recommend discussing treatment options carefully and in advance during the later stages of the disease. It is advisable to consider administering conscious sedation (such as midazolam or diazepam) or general anesthesia in a hospital setting for treatment interventions, especially in late-stage disease.

### Interventions for treating asymptomatic impacted wisdom teeth in adolescents and adults [^113pcR7G]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

The prophylactic removal of asymptomatic impacted wisdom teeth is defined as the surgical removal of wisdom teeth in the absence of local disease. Impacted wisdom teeth have been associated with pathological changes, such as inflammation of the gums around the tooth, root resorption, gum and alveolar bone disease, damage to adjacent teeth, and the development of cysts and tumors. Several other reasons have been given to justify prophylactic removal. Wisdom teeth do not always fulfill a functional role in the mouth. When surgical removal is carried out in older patients, the risk of more postoperative complications, pain, and discomfort increases. Nevertheless, in most developed countries, the prophylactic removal of trouble-free wisdom teeth, either impacted or fully erupted, has long been considered 'appropriate care'. Prudent decision-making, with adherence to specified indicators for removal, may reduce the number of surgical procedures by 60% or more. It has been suggested that watchful monitoring of asymptomatic wisdom teeth may be an appropriate strategy.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effect of prophylactic removal of asymptomatic impacted wisdom teeth in adolescents and adults compared to the retention of these wisdom teeth.

- **Search strategy**: The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (4 August 2004), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1966 to 4 August 2004), PubMed (1966 to 4 August 2004), and EMBASE (1974 to 4 August 2004). There was no restriction on language.

### Differential diagnosis of facial pain and guidelines for management [^111LZfvf]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and management of facial pain below the eye can vary significantly depending on whether the patient consults a dentist or a medical practitioner. A structured approach to accurate diagnosis begins with a comprehensive history. The most common acute causes of pain are dental-related and are well managed by dentists. Chronic facial pain can be unilateral or bilateral and continuous or episodic. The most common non-dental pains are temporomandibular disorders (TMDs), particularly those involving the musculoskeletal system and the muscles of mastication, either unilaterally or bilaterally. These may be associated with other chronic pain conditions. A wide range of treatments are used; however, early diagnosis, reassurance, and some simple physiotherapy often prove effective for individuals with good coping strategies. Dentists often create splints for night-time use.

Neuropathic pain is usually unilateral and episodic, with trigeminal neuralgia being the most easily recognized type. This severe, electric-shock-like pain, which can be provoked by light touch, responds best to carbamazepine and neurosurgery in poorly controlled patients. Trauma, whether major or due to dental procedures, results in neuropathic pain, which is then managed similarly to other types of neuropathic pain. Red flags include giant cell arteritis, which must be distinguished from temporomandibular disorders (TMDs), particularly in individuals over 50 years old, and cancer, which can present as progressive neuropathic pain. Burning mouth syndrome is rarely recognized as a neuropathic pain condition, occurring primarily in peri-menopausal women and is often thought to be psychological.

### The practical evaluation and management of patients with symptoms of a sore burning mouth [^111VMYwW]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

There are many etiologic factors to consider in a patient who presents with symptoms or sensations of a sore burning mouth. These range from local causes within the oral cavity to underlying systemic disease, including psychologic factors. This paper aims to describe the different clinical presentations and to outline a systematic approach to the evaluation and management of such patients.

The clinician will be directed to the relevant diagnosis by following the traditional medical model, which involves taking a focused history, performing a thorough clinical examination, considering the potential differential diagnoses, and requesting pertinent and appropriate investigations. The various differential diagnoses and broad treatment options will also be discussed and outlined.

This paper will not, however, discuss burning mouth syndrome (oral dysesthesia), which is a diagnosis of exclusion in which the oral mucosa is clinically normal and there are no identifiable medical or dental causes to account for the patient's symptoms.

### Dental topics for plastic surgeons, part three: Infection and trauma of the dentition [^113BguFU]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Condensing osteitis and chronic osteomyelitis with proliferative periostitis, also known as Garre sclerosing osteomyelitis, are two other relatively common entities associated with a localized inflammatory response in the maxillofacial region. Condensing osteitis, also known as focal sclerosing osteomyelitis, involves areas of bony sclerosis adjacent to apical infections or pulpal necrosis. It is effectively managed by treating the underlying tooth infection. Garre sclerosing osteomyelitis is typically found in the pediatric population and often results from an odontogenic source of infection or inflammation. This disorder is characterized by the formation of multiple parallel layers of reactive bone due to stimulation of the overlying periosteum. Treatment of the underlying source of inflammation typically leads to resolution and restoration of normal bone after 6 to 12 months. In some instances, osseous recontouring may be necessary.

- **Figure 5**: Garre osteomyelitis of the left mandible. CT scan shows the classic "onion skinning" presentation of redundant layers of reactive cortical bone. CT, computed tomography.

There are other less common variants of osteomyelitis, such as diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis, primary chronic osteomyelitis, and chronic tendoperiostitis. Although an in-depth discussion of these often non-surgical pathologies is beyond the scope of this article, brief descriptions of each are provided. Diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis results after an unknown stimulus (potentially prior chronic bacterial infection) stimulates sclerosis of the surrounding bone.

### Are there differences in the causes and complications of mandibular third molar extraction in older patients compared to younger patients [^117WVZGu]? Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Although most impacted third molars (ITMs) are extracted in the teens and early 20s, some individuals undergo extractions after their 40s. It remains unclear whether the reasons for extraction, the degree of impaction, and complications differ in patients within an older age group compared to a younger age group.

The purpose of this study was to measure the association between age and:

1. Reason for extraction
2. Postoperative complications.

- **Study design, setting, and sample**: This retrospective cohort study involved patients who had undergone the surgical extraction of at least one mandibular ITM at a single institution. We excluded patients under 20 years of age, those with a follow-up period of less than 1 week, and cases where tooth extraction occurred under general anesthesia.

- **Predictor variable**: The primary predictor variable was age, classified into three groups: 20s (20–29), 30s (30–39), and over 40s (40 and greater).

- **Main outcome variables**: The primary outcome variables were the reason for extraction (prophylactic or symptomatic) and the presence of complications. The secondary outcome variable was the type of complication, including postoperative infection, dry socket, neurosensory disturbance, presenting pain lasting over 1 month, and retained roots requiring secondary treatment.

- **Covariates**: The covariates included sex, laterality of ITM, and difficulty of extraction measured by the difficulty index. This index is based on depth, orientation, and ramus relationship/space available, with a higher score indicating greater difficulty.

- **Analyses**: A χ² test was performed to analyze the association of categorical outcome variables and covariates.

### Accuracy of MR neurography as a diagnostic tool in detecting injuries to the lingual and inferior alveolar nerve in patients with iatrogenic post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathy [^116MWb3V]. European Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

The trigeminal nerve (TN) provides sensation to the face through its three major branches: the ophthalmic, maxillary, and mandibular nerves. The mandibular nerve has an additional function in supplying innervation to the muscles responsible for biting and chewing. Maxillofacial surgery and dental procedures, such as implant placement, molar tooth extraction, and local anesthesia, carry a risk of damaging one of these branches, potentially resulting in neurosensory deficiencies — a condition known as iatrogenic post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathy (PTN). When accompanied by pain, this condition is referred to as post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathic pain.

The lingual nerve (LN) and inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) are most frequently affected. Post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathic pain is described by the International Classification of Orofacial Pain (ICOP) as "unilateral or bilateral facial or oral pain following and caused by trauma to the trigeminal nerve(s), with other symptoms and/or clinical signs of trigeminal nerve dysfunction, and persisting or recurring for more than three months". It suggests the following criteria for diagnosis: pain in an area innervated by the TN, association of this pain with signs of nerve dysfunction in the same area, history of an injury to the TN, onset of the pain within six months after the injury, not better accounted for by another ICOP or International Classification of Headache Disorders version 3 (ICHD-3) diagnosis, and the presence of a lesion to the TN, which should be able to explain the pain, confirmed by a diagnostic test.

### The tooth, the whole tooth, and nothing but the tooth: Can dental pain ever be the sole presenting symptom of a myocardial infarction? A systematic review [^112tjAz7]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Pain symptoms related to cardiac ischemia can vary greatly from patient to patient. However, should emergency physicians consider the possibility of myocardial infarction in patients who present solely with dental pain?

- **Objective**: This is a systematic review of the literature investigating the incidence of jaw, tooth, or facial pain as the sole symptom of cardiac ischemia.

- **Methods**: Studies investigating jaw, tooth, or facial pain of cardiac origin were identified using the PubMed database. All English studies in which cardiac pain originated in the face, teeth, or jaw were screened for inclusion. Data were abstracted from each study utilizing a structured review process and rated for methodological quality.

- **Results**: Eighteen studies met study criteria: 16 were case reports, and the remaining 2 were prospective cohort studies. After quality assessment and categorization, nine reports were categorized as weak, eight moderate, and one strong methodological quality.

- **Conclusion**: Cardiac ischemia may present in no anatomic location other than the face or jaw. However, despite frequent claims in the literature to the contrary, the lack of methodological quality of the studies investigated impedes a firm conclusion of face, jaw, or tooth pain as the only symptom of cardiac insufficiency.

### Cervicofacial emphysema after dental treatment with emphasis on the anatomy of the cervical fascia [^113mNm9N]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

The fascial organization of the neck is quite complex and highly variable between individuals. Fascial layers separate very important structures in the neck and form anatomical barriers against the spread of infections. However, this alignment can also facilitate the spread of infection through connected fascial spaces. This study discusses the potential anatomical pathways resulting in cervicofacial emphysema with a case example. The development of cervicofacial emphysema after dental treatment is a well-known complication, particularly when using high-speed turbines. A 39-year-old female patient was referred to our private dental clinic with complaints of swelling in her right supraclavicular region and edema of the right orbit, notably without pain. In this case, emphysema reached the supraclavicular region via the retropharyngeal space and prevertebral fascia. This case illustrates anatomically how air or other materials, including pathogens or infections, can easily pass from the oral cavity into the thorax or even the abdomen through fascial planes.

### Antibiotics to prevent complications following tooth extractions [^112HWQmf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). High credibility.

The most frequent indications for tooth extractions are dental caries and periodontal infections, and these extractions are generally performed by general dental practitioners. Antibiotics may be prescribed to patients undergoing extractions to prevent complications due to infection.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effect of antibiotic prophylaxis on the development of infectious complications following tooth extractions.

- **Search methods**: The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 25 January 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 1), MEDLINE via OVID (1948 to 25 January 2012), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 25 January 2012), and LILACS via BIREME (1982 to 25 January 2012). There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients undergoing tooth extraction(s) for any indication.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias for the included studies and extracted data. We contacted trial authors for further details where these were unclear. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using random-effects models. For continuous outcomes, we used mean differences (MD) with 95% CI using random-effects models. We examined potential sources of heterogeneity. The quality of the body of evidence has been assessed using the GRADE tool.

### Risk factors for onset of chronic oro-facial pain — results of the North Cheshire oro-facial pain prospective population study [^115pbiR8]. Pain (2010). Low credibility.

- **Study response rates**: From 4200 persons invited to participate, 2505 returned completed questionnaires at baseline. Of these, 1735 consented to further contact and were eligible for inclusion in the follow-up study. Of these, 1329 (77% of those mailed and 53% of baseline responders) returned completed questionnaires (1253 full questionnaires, 36 short questionnaires, and 40 telephone questionnaires). However, 205 (51%) of the non-responders (N = 406) were ineligible to take part as they had migrated (N = 4), were deceased (N = 22), were at the wrong address (N = 58), or were not on the electoral register (N = 121) and thereby unlikely to be living at the given address. This gave the study a high adjusted participation of 87% among the baseline responders agreeing to follow-up and considered likely to have received the follow-up questionnaire (1329/(1735–205) (Fig. 2).

	- When the data from the follow-up and baseline studies were collated, a further eight subjects were dropped due to inaccuracies, for example, in dates of birth and genders on the questionnaire when compared with the General Practice database. This gave a total sample for the analysis of 1321.

- **Risk factors for the onset of COFP: Univariate analysis**: Of those included in the sample for analysis (N = 1321), 1221 (92%) were free of COFP at baseline while 95 (7%) had the condition. Data on COFP were missing for five subjects. Of those who were free of COFP, 56 (4.6%) went on to develop symptoms at 2-year follow-up (Fig. 1). As shown in Table 1, subjects in the 18–35 year age group were significantly more likely to develop COFP.

### Common dental emergencies [^116DrWcy]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Dental caries, a bacterial disease of teeth characterized by the destruction of enamel and dentine, is often the underlying cause of dental pain. When a carious lesion impinges on the dental pulp, pulpitis follows and, ultimately, necrosis of the pulp occurs. Untreated necrosis may lead to a localized abscess or a spreading infection into the surrounding soft tissue that results in cellulitis. Immediate treatment involves antibiotic therapy for cellulitis, perhaps with drainage of abscesses, while definitive treatment requires root canal therapy or extraction of the involved tooth.

Pericoronitis is an inflammation of the soft tissue overlying a partially erupted tooth. Localized cases respond to irrigation. Secondary cellulitis can develop. Definitive treatment may require surgical extraction of the underlying tooth or excision of the gum flap.

Avulsion of a permanent tooth secondary to trauma is a true dental emergency. The tooth should be reimplanted on the spot, and the patient should be seen immediately by a dentist for splinting and antibiotic prophylaxis.

Most dental problems can be prevented with regular dental care and steps to minimize risks of oral trauma.

### The acute orbit: etiology, diagnosis, and therapy [^114y8foB]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

The extension of dental abscesses to distant areas of the head and neck has been repeatedly reported in the medical literature. Subsequent involvement of the orbit still remains a rarity, resulting in a protracted onset of therapy due to inaccurate diagnosis. Considering the possible lasting damage, such as blindness or even death, that can result from insufficient therapy, the need to extensively educate practicing physicians becomes evident.

With the help of a comprehensive review of the medical literature supported by a clinical case, the etiology, diagnosis, and therapy of the acute orbit are highlighted. This is done with an emphasis on the new imaging modalities as well as the broad-spectrum antibiotics currently available in the market.

Orbital infections of odontogenic origin are the rarest sequelae, with a prevalence of 1.3%. Correct diagnosis, adequate antibiotic therapy, and surgical drainage are the keys to success.

The acute orbit continues to be a medical challenge. With the proposed diagnostic and therapy guidelines, this affliction can be identified and contained with a high degree of certainty.

### Recurring transient tooth pain as newly described symptom of migratory loiasis: A mixed-methods study in rural Gabon [^1146Xfyp]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Low credibility.

In a qualitative study conducted between 2018 and 2020, on the knowledge, attitudes, practices, and perceptions of loiasis in a highly endemic region of rural Gabon, in-depth interviews employing open-ended questions were performed with patients known to suffer from loiasis. Interviews were performed until saturation was observed for key outcomes. Participants were interviewed about all disease manifestations they experienced, and transient tooth pain was reported several times as one of the symptoms of loiasis. The tooth pain was reported to be located in the jaw and characterized as stabbing, without any other physical correlate. One participant described it by the analogy, "les vers creusent les dents", indicating piercing pain of the jaw and teeth in the respective dental quadrant. The pain was almost always restricted to one quadrant and was often further localized. It gradually increased over a period of hours and resolved spontaneously without further medical intervention within a few days until it reappeared at a different location in the oral cavity. Several participants indicated a temporal proximity of the occurrence of transient tooth pain with eye-worm migration, where one symptom commonly preceded the other.

In a second step, a quantitative survey of knowledge, attitudes, and practices was performed in the community of Sindara, Ngounié Province, in central Gabon in 2022 (institutional ethics committee of CERMEL approval no. CEI-008/2021). This village is characterized by one of the highest reported prevalences of loiasis in the endemic world.

### What is the risk of developing medication-related osteonecrosis in patients with extraction sockets left to heal by secondary intention? A retrospective case series study [^1138Lxnf]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Tooth and root extractions are known trigger factors for medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ). The best healing modality for postextraction sockets is still debated. The aim of the study was to estimate the incidence of MRONJ after extractions whose sockets were left to heal by secondary intention.

A retrospective case series study was conducted at the Department of Odontostomatological and Maxillofacial Sciences, Sapienza University of Rome. Only patients who underwent nonsurgical extractions, healed by secondary intention, were included in the study. The parameters considered included age, sex, pathologies for which bisphosphonates or other drugs related to MRONJ were prescribed, any local or systemic risk factors, type of drug used, route of administration, number of extractions performed, and number of sessions required to complete the extraction program. The main outcome variable was the occurrence of MRONJ. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software.

A total of 221 patients were treated from 2007 to 2020, with 639 tooth/root extractions. All patients were treated under antibiotic prophylaxis and with anesthesia without vasoconstrictors. No cases of MRONJ were reported. The mean age of patients was 68.02 ± 11.17 years. The majority of the study sample was represented by women (201 = 90.95%) undergoing treatment for osteometabolic pathologies, most frequently postmenopausal osteoporosis. Alendronate was the most frequently prescribed drug, taken mainly orally. Most patients had local and/or systemic risk factors.

### Infected complex odontoma: an unusual presentation [^111fV3HJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Odontomas represent a hamartomatous malformation. They are usually asymptomatic and are diagnosed on routine radiological examination. The eruption and infection of odontoma are uncommon. Till now, only 20 cases of erupted odontoma have been reported in the literature. We report an unusual case of infected complex odontoma with eruption of odontoma in the oral cavity and perforation of the cheeks with a tooth impacted upon, which makes the presentation unusual and has not been reported earlier. It is essential for dentists to be familiar with common and unusual appearances of odontoma for proper diagnosis and management.

### Cutaneous neck lesion of occult odontogenic origin: Search for the tooth [^112VNuPB]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis for inflammatory neck swellings is extensive; however, a swelling of dental origin should be considered. Although rare, they can mimic more common causes of neck lumps. We report a case involving a submandibular swelling in a young female patient that was initially presumed to be an epidermoid cyst by her general medical practitioner. After six months of unsuccessful treatment in the community, an odontogenic source was identified. This led to successful treatment following referral to a local Oral and Maxillofacial department.

### Systemic antibiotics for symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess in adults [^117R6kXZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

Dental pain can have a detrimental effect on quality of life. Symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess are common causes of dental pain and arise from an inflamed or necrotic dental pulp, or infection of the pulpless root canal system. Clinical guidelines recommend that the first-line treatment for teeth with these conditions should be removal of the source of inflammation or infection by local, operative measures, and that systemic antibiotics are currently only recommended for situations where there is evidence of spreading infection (cellulitis, lymph node involvement, diffuse swelling) or systemic involvement (fever, malaise). Despite this, there is evidence that dentists frequently prescribe antibiotics in the absence of these signs. There is concern that this could contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial colonies within both the individual and the community. This review is an update of the original version that was published in 2014.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of systemic antibiotics provided with or without surgical intervention (such as extraction, incision and drainage of a swelling, or endodontic treatment), with or without analgesics, for symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess in adults.

- **Search methods**: Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 26 February 2018), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 1) in the Cochrane Library (searched 26 February 2018), and MEDLINE Ovid.

### An asymptomatic draining lesion on the cheek [^111pRHqD]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

A 14-year-old boy presented to a medical mission clinic in the Dominican Republic with a history spanning several years of an asymptomatic draining lesion on his left buccal cheek. He reported that he had experienced tooth pain in the past, which resolved several months prior to his presentation. On physical examination, there was a several-centimeter, bound-down, erythematous plaque with central ulceration (Fig 1). Intraoral examination revealed a nonvital first permanent molar, tooth 19 (Fig 2). A radiograph showed a periapical radial lucency consistent with a periapical abscess (Fig 3).

- **Question 1**: What is the most likely diagnosis?
	- A. Furuncle
	- B. Pyogenic granuloma
	- C. Cutaneous sinus of dental origin (dental sinus)
	- D. Squamous cell carcinoma
	- E. Osteomyelitis

- **Answers**:
	- A. Furuncle – Incorrect. Furuncles are skin abscesses that typically involve hair follicles and surrounding tissue; red, tender swollen nodules usually appear. The centralization of the lesion around a periapical abscess makes this less likely.
	- B. Pyogenic granuloma – Incorrect. Pyogenic granuloma is a benign vascular tumor that occurs on both mucosa and skin and appears as an overgrowth of tissue due to irritation, physical trauma, and hormonal factors. It usually involves the gums.
	- C. Cutaneous sinus of dental origin (dental sinus) – Correct. Cutaneous sinus of dental origin presents with dimpling or retraction of the skin, and a cordlike tract attached to the underlying alveolar bone may be palpable. Expression of a purulent discharge with applied pressure confirms the presence of a sinus tract, and radiolucency at the apex indicates the connection to a dental source.

### Complications following dental treatment in a child with haemophilia A: Lessons to be learnt [^111rq2di]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

A boy in his middle childhood with severe haemophilia reported with facial swelling following dental treatment for a carious upper primary molar done at a private dental clinic elsewhere. On presentation, he had a large, tense, and tender swelling of the left cheek and a haematoma on the buccal mucosa adjacent to the treated tooth. The child was found to have a low haemoglobin level. He was taken for an emergency procedure under general anaesthesia for dental extraction with incision and drainage, and simultaneously underwent packed cells and factor replacement. He recovered in the ward postoperatively with no complications and a gradual reduction of the swelling. This report highlights the importance of caries prevention in children, especially those with haemophilia. They need to be educated about restricting cariogenic foods in their diet and maintaining good oral hygiene. Management of such patients should be carefully coordinated to minimise undesirable outcomes.

### An artificial intelligence tool for the diagnosis of facial pain [^111z2JUJ]. Neurosurgery (2025).

Differentiation between temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) and trigeminal neuralgia (TN) as causes of orofacial pain is very important because the nature of these disorders and their treatments are vastly different. TMDs are usually treated with a rehabilitative approach, although dental correction or even surgery may be necessary in rare cases where the origin of the pain appears to be related to oral or temporomandibular joint pathology. By contrast, TN is largely treated with anticonvulsant medications, trigeminal nerve surgery, or trigeminal ablative procedures. TMDs are several orders of magnitude more common than TN, which may result in misdiagnosis and mistreatment if the proper diagnosis is not made initially.

- **Methods**: We completed a study of 101 patients with either TMD or TN using supervised machine learning. A predictive model was developed using the two inputs of a questionnaire and directed physical examination.

- **Results**: The network was trained to achieve the corresponding correct output, which was based on orofacial physical examination and expert diagnosis of each subject.

- **Conclusion**: The analysis of this network indicated that TMDs and TN can be reliably differentiated using a standardized questionnaire and physical examination with approximately 90% accuracy.

### Recurring transient tooth pain as newly described symptom of migratory loiasis: A mixed-methods study in rural Gabon [^1127uAuH]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Low credibility.

This finding corresponds well to the findings of this study indicating that transient tooth pain may be directly or indirectly caused in the orofacial region by the adult worm migration. Similar findings have been previously reported for other filarial pathogens.

- **Transient nature of symptom**: Given the transient nature of the reported symptom, the proximity to the anatomic predilection site of *L. loa* in the orofacial region, and its analogy with other filarial pathogens, we hypothesize that the transient tooth pain reported here shares the same pathophysiological mechanism.

This first report of transient tooth pain as a clinical symptom associated with loiasis is not without limitations. A main shortcoming is the lack of a thorough clinical and radiological dental examination in the cross-sectional survey, which was beyond the scope of this pilot study. Although a dental examination was not performed for all participants, the oral cavity of selected patients in the qualitative study was assessed by a physician. No evidence for other causes of dental disease was observed in this limited number of participants.

It may also be speculated whether the reported tooth pain may more appropriately be classified as jaw pain or oral pain depending on the main site of inflammation. However, because patients consistently reported the symptom as tooth pain, we are confident using this patient-reported terminology. The study was also slightly underpowered to demonstrate statistically with a frequentist approach that tooth pain was associated with loiasis at α = 0.05.

### The many faces of periapical inflammation [^117WKw6h]. Clinical Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Dental periapical inflammation is common and can present with a wide variety of symptoms and signs. These include jaw pain and local soft-tissue inflammation, which may be obviously dental in origin; however, the presentation may also be with a painless mass or draining cutaneous sinus, with facial or ear pain, or with symptoms of sinusitis, when the dental cause is not clinically obvious. Radiologists are often the first to recognize the dental source of symptoms in these cases. This recognition requires an awareness of the varied manifestations of periapical sepsis and careful systematic review of the teeth and jaws. The causative periapical lesion may be small and subtle, and there is not always a macroscopic defect in the cortical bone between the lesion and surrounding soft-tissue inflammation. The origin of the referral and the initial imaging technique used can vary.

Dental periapical inflammation can also be an incidental finding on imaging. In these cases, it should not be mistaken for more sinister pathology, and its presence should be conveyed to the referrer so that appropriate dental treatment can be initiated; this is especially important in patients with malignancy in whom radiotherapy is planned. In cases of severe odontogenic soft-tissue sepsis, a review of the airway and major blood vessels is important. We present cases to illustrate the wide range of clinical and radiological manifestations of periapical inflammatory pathology.

### Radiolucent lesions of the mandible: A pattern-based approach to diagnosis [^114XgcMn]. Insights into Imaging (2014).

- **Radiolucent lesions with ill-defined borders**: Osteomyelitis is still relatively common in the jaws despite the introduction of antibiotics and improved medical care. The mandible is affected more often than the maxilla. Depending on the clinical course, osteomyelitis of the mandible can be classified into three forms: acute, secondary chronic, and primary chronic. The acute and secondary chronic forms are manifestations of the same disease entity, distinguished by an arbitrary time limit of one month. These forms are typically caused by bacterial infection in settings such as pulpal or periodontal infection, mandibular foreign bodies, sepsis, or trauma. In dental infection, pulpal infection extends into the bone marrow, leading to the compression of blood vessels from periapical lesions.

	- Acute forms present with severe symptoms such as pain, swelling, fever, lymphadenopathy, or a mobile tooth sensitive to percussion. Additional symptoms might include paresthesia in the lower lip (V3 nerve), trismus, or fistula with pus. In advanced stages, osteomyelitis may also involve pathological fractures. The chronic forms are clinically silent but often include painful periods. Predisposing factors include diabetes, immunosuppression, radiotherapy, and bisphosphonates.

	- While the diagnosis of osteomyelitis can be made clinically in many cases, imaging is especially helpful to define the extent and assess the severity of the lesion. The radiological appearance of osteomyelitis depends on the stage of the disease. It consists of an ill-defined osteolytic lesion.

### Iatrogenic subcutaneous emphysema after dental treatment [^115mbts1]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Subcutaneous emphysema as a complication of a dental procedure is uncommon. When it does occur, it can result in significant and sometimes alarming cervicofacial swelling. Management in most cases involves close observation while awaiting spontaneous resolution. However, in some cases, the swelling can progress to cause serious complications and even death. Even though such complications are more commonly seen by our dental and oromaxillofacial surgery colleagues, otolaryngologists should be aware of this condition since we are often asked to consult in these cases.

We describe the case of a 13-year-old girl who presented to the emergency department of our institution with an unusually dramatic acute-onset cervicofacial swelling after she had undergone a dental procedure earlier in the day. Computed tomography revealed subcutaneous emphysema. The patient was admitted to the hospital for close observation, and within 24 hours, her condition had improved significantly. Shortly after discharge, she experienced a complete recovery. We review the clinical presentation, physical examination findings, diagnostic workup, and management of this complication.

### Do different modes of delivering postoperative instructions to patients help reduce the side effects of tooth extraction? A randomized clinical trial [^111bDuhD]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2018). High credibility.

Postoperative instructions that are properly delivered can decrease postextraction side effects, such as stress, anxiety, and pain, in patients undergoing dental extraction. This study examined the role of the mode of delivering postoperative instructions in decreasing the side effects of dental extraction and increasing patient satisfaction after the procedure.

This randomized clinical trial was conducted on a population of 120 patients presenting to the oral and maxillofacial outpatient clinic affiliated with the Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (Shiraz, Iran) in 2015. The patients were randomly assigned to three groups of 40 per group. The first group received only verbal instructions after their surgical procedure. The second group received only written instructions. The third group received both verbal and written instructions. Details on the patients' age, gender, and formal education were recorded before the operation using a questionnaire. The second part of the questionnaire was completed by patients one week after their tooth extraction and recorded their postoperative pain, bleeding, swelling, and satisfaction. Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test, Kruskal-Wallis test, χ² test, and analysis of covariance at a significance level of 95%.

Of the 120 participants, 77 were women and 43 were men; the participants' mean age was 36.45 ± 10.69 years. The results showed that the mode of delivering instructions had a marked relation with pain and patient satisfaction. Pain intensity was significantly higher in the verbal instruction group.

### Orofacial pain for clinicians: A review of constant and attack-like facial pain syndromes [^111yi19j]. Cephalalgia (2023). Low credibility.

Primary headache syndromes such as migraines are among the most common neurological syndromes. Chronic facial pain syndromes of non-odontogenic causes are less well known to neurologists, despite being highly disabling. Given the pain localization, these patients often consult dentists first, who may conduct unnecessary dental interventions even if a dental cause is not identified. Once it becomes clear that dental modalities have no effect on the pain, patients may be referred to another dentist or orofacial pain specialist, and later to a neurologist. Unfortunately, neurologists are also often not familiar with chronic orofacial pain syndromes, although they share the neural system, i.e. the trigeminal nerve and central processing areas for headache disorders.

In essence, three broad groups of orofacial pain patients are important for clinicians:

- **Attack-like orofacial pain conditions**: These encompass neuralgias of the cranial nerves and less well-known facial variants of primary headache syndromes.
- **Persistent orofacial pain disorders**: These include neuropathic pain and persistent idiopathic facial/dentoalveolar pain.
- **Other differential diagnostically relevant orofacial pain conditions**: Conditions such as painful temporomandibular disorders, bruxism, sinus pain, and dental pain, which may interfere (trigger) and overlap with headaches.

It is rewarding to know and recognize the clinical picture of these facial pain syndromes, given that, just like for headaches, an internationally accepted classification system has been published.

### Necrotising sialometaplasia at multiple sites: a therapeutic challenge to oral physicians [^114T44zT]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Necrotising sialometaplasia is a rare, benign, and self-limiting inflammatory lesion commonly involving minor salivary glands. Its clinical appearance, signs, and symptoms often mimic a carcinomatous lesion, creating a diagnostic dilemma for clinicians. As an important differential diagnosis for apparent carcinoma, necrotising sialometaplasia should be excluded histologically prior to radical therapy.

This condition typically occurs on the palatal mucosa following a palatal infiltration anaesthesia. Patients often report to the dentist with a sudden onset of painful ulcerations that rapidly increase in size. This case report describes the occurrence of necrotising sialometaplasia in a 46-year-old man with an unusual clinical presentation at multiple sites in the oral cavity. The importance of history taking, thorough clinical examination, and careful histopathological examination in diagnosing necrotising sialometaplasia is highlighted in this paper.

### Clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of X-linked hypophosphataemia [^112FoRf1]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Recommendations for management of dental health**: In children and adults with ongoing oral manifestations, we recommend treatment with active vitamin D and phosphate supplementation to improve dentin mineralization, reduce the number of dental abscesses, and lessen the severity of periodontitis (grade B, moderate recommendation).

	- In children, in addition to standard preventive care, we recommend dental visits every 6 months and suggest sealing pits and fissures with flowable resin composite on both temporary and permanent teeth as soon and as frequently as required (grade C, weak recommendation).

	- We suggest a thorough clinical investigation to search for pulp necrosis (evidenced by color changes, fistula, swelling, abscess, cellulitis, or pain) and performing retrocoronal and/or periapical radiographs, or orthopantomogram, to search for enlarged pulp chambers and periapical bone loss depending on clinical examination findings (grade B, weak recommendation).

	- We suggest optimizing conventional medical treatment of X-linked hypophosphataemia before initiating orthodontic treatment (grade C, moderate recommendation).

- In adults, we recommend twice-yearly visits to perform conventional supportive periodontal therapy, which should include periodontal risk assessment as well as supragingival and subgingival debridement if necessary (grade B, moderate recommendation).

	- We suggest that dental implant surgery should be performed after 3–6 months of medical treatment, which should be continued for 6 months following implant surgery; healing time should be extended up to 6 months.

### Osteonecrosis of the jaw and antiresorptive agents in benign and malignant diseases: A critical review organized by the ECTS [^115mhcWU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Signs and symptoms of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) may include local pain, mucosal swelling, erythema, tooth mobility, tooth abscess, ulceration, altered sensation because of compression of the nerves by surrounding inflammation, and even paresthesia or anesthesia of the associated branch of the trigeminal nerve. However, exposed bone may remain asymptomatic for a long time and manifest clinical features only when inflammation of the surrounding tissue occurs.

Unfortunately, early signs of MRONJ include nonspecific sinus pain, odontalgia, and altered neurosensory function, which may prevent diagnosis and require a high index of suspicion when evaluating patients on antiresorptive and/or antiangiogenic agents.

Later findings could be fistulae, which develop when necrotic jawbone tissue becomes infected, and chronic maxillary sinusitis with or without an oral-antral fistula secondary to maxilla osteonecrosis. The latter may rarely be the presenting feature in these patients.

Oral and general quality of life (QoL) is affected in individuals who develop MRONJ and worsens with advancement of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) stage. The deterioration is mainly attributed to symptoms, mostly pain and chewing difficulties, feelings of uncertainty, speech difficulties, weight loss, and socializing issues. Pharmacological management and, even more so, surgical intervention may improve QoL.

### American Cancer Society head and neck cancer survivorship care guideline [^111rvgKp]. CA (2016). High credibility.

In the follow-up and surveillance for nasopharyngeal cancer, particularly concerning survivorship and rehabilitation such as oral and dental care, the ACS 2016 guidelines recommend monitoring patients for symptoms like swelling of the jaw or jaw pain, which may indicate possible osteonecrosis. Conservative treatment is suggested for early-stage lesions, including the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and daily saline or aqueous chlorhexidine gluconate irrigations. It is also advised to refer patients to a head and neck surgeon for further consideration. Options may include hyperbaric oxygen therapy for early and intermediate lesions, debridement of necrotic bone while continuing conservative management, or dealing with external mandible bony exposure through the skin.

### Cervicofacial emphysema complicating a dental procedure [^1114AiEN]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Cervicofacial subcutaneous emphysema can occur rarely following a dental procedure, especially tooth extraction, and can be misdiagnosed as an allergic reaction or post-procedure swelling.

We report a rare case of a 29-year-old man who developed extensive cervicofacial subcutaneous emphysema following a dental hygiene procedure. A review of the relevant literature is presented in our report.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?**: Early identification and management of this potentially life-threatening condition is particularly important and can prevent serious complications, leading to improved patient outcomes.
