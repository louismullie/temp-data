## Question

A 52-year-old male with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus has swelling and discomfort in the testicular area — what are the differential diagnoses and management?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the differential diagnosis and management of testicular swelling and discomfort in a 52-year-old man with uncontrolled diabetes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about time-sensitive emergencies such as testicular torsion and necrotizing soft tissue infection of the perineum (Fournier's gangrene). Then, I should consider common infectious causes like epididymo-orchitis and abscess. Next, I will integrate targeted history, focused examination, and immediate imaging to refine the differential. Finally, I will outline empiric management pathways, surgical indications, and diabetes-specific medication and glycemic considerations with appropriate consultation triggers [^117L1kG2] [^116Kp8LT] [^113Bh96P] [^113q8nYm].

> Let me first confirm the immediate red flags and triage priorities. I need to check for torsion features such as sudden onset severe pain, high-riding or horizontal testis, and absent cremasteric reflex, because salvage falls sharply beyond 6 hours and this remains a surgical emergency even in adults, not just adolescents, despite my initial tendency to think torsion is "mostly pediatric" [^117L1kG2] [^111Hj1LW]. Wait, I should verify for Fournier's gangrene as well: rapidly progressive pain, erythema, skin discoloration, crepitus, systemic toxicity, or perineal involvement mandate urgent broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgical debridement; crepitus is classic, but hold on, let me correct myself — crepitus can be absent early and relying on it alone risks delay, with CT helpful to define extent when time and stability allow [^116Kp8LT] [^113YT3hh].

> Next, I will take a focused history and exam while avoiding premature closure. I should confirm onset and tempo of symptoms, fever or rigors, dysuria or urethral discharge, recent trauma, sexual exposures, medication history including SGLT2 inhibitors, and prior similar episodes, because these elements pivot the differential toward torsion, epididymo-orchitis, abscess, hematoma, neoplasm, hernia, hydrocele, varicocele, or neuropathic pain in diabetes [^113c9qu6] [^116Kp8LT] [^114n59eL] [^11582Q7A]. On exam, I need to inspect for erythema, edema, fluctuance, skin necrosis, or crepitus, palpate for focal tenderness or a firm non-tender mass, assess testicular lie and cremasteric reflex, attempt transillumination, and check the inguinal region for a reducible bulge, because these findings discriminate infection or abscess from neoplasm, hernia, hydrocele, varicocele, and torsion phenotypes [^117L1kG2] [^11582Q7A] [^114Jepnx] [^1124maWW].

> I will now examine the most likely and dangerous differentials in this 52-year-old with uncontrolled diabetes. Acute epididymo-orchitis is common at this age and may progress to testicular or epididymal abscess in diabetics; ultrasound frequently shows epididymal enlargement, hyperemia, hydrocele, and can demonstrate an avascular complex collection in abscess, with concomitant orchitis in nearly half of cases in prospective series [^113Bh96P] [^112GoTS6]. But wait, what if symptoms are fulminant or extend to the perineum? Fournier's gangrene risk is higher in diabetes and with SGLT2 inhibitors; it requires immediate surgical debridement plus broad-spectrum antibiotics, and CT can delineate disease spread when feasible without delaying operative care [^116Kp8LT] [^113q8nYm] [^111A3Uya] [^115ANtpe]. I should also keep torsion in mind when pain is sudden with absent cremasteric reflex and decreased or absent flow on Doppler, because adults can and do torsed, and mislabeling as "orchitis" can be catastrophic [^117L1kG2] [^111Hj1LW].

> Hold on, I should verify additional structural causes. A firm, non-tender intratesticular mass raises testicular neoplasm and warrants urgent urologic evaluation; ultrasound shows a hypoechoic solid lesion and tumor markers may assist, but biopsy is not performed through the scrotum because orchiectomy is the standard approach for suspected malignancy [^11582Q7A]. Trauma with heterogeneous avascular collections suggests hematoma; absence of internal Doppler flow supports hematoma over neoplasm, yet diabetics are not immune to incidental tumors, so interval imaging is prudent to ensure resolution and exclude an underlying mass [^114n59eL]. A "bag-of-worms" feel suggests varicocele, while a reducible bulge with cough impulse points toward inguinal hernia with scrotal extension, both of which can mimic scrotal swelling and need differentiation clinically and by imaging when uncertain [^114Jepnx] [^1124maWW].

> Let me first confirm the immediate investigations that will change management quickly. I need a scrotal ultrasound with color Doppler urgently for acute pain without trauma because this is the recommended first-line imaging to distinguish torsion from infection or other causes, and it can demonstrate hyperemia in epididymo-orchitis, absent or reduced flow in torsion, and avascular cavities in abscess; even when flow is preserved, ancillary torsion signs like horizontal lie and globular enlargement matter, so I should not anchor on color flow alone [^117L1kG2] [^111Hj1LW]. If necrotizing infection is suspected, I should obtain CT of the abdomen and pelvis to define disease extent when it will not delay surgery, acknowledging that air and fascial thickening are typical but early cases may show subtle changes [^116Kp8LT]. Lab studies should include CBC, CRP or ESR, urinalysis and culture, and in toxic patients blood cultures; if a solid mass is found, tumor markers should be sent preoperatively, and diabetes labs will help guide inpatient glycemic optimization [^113Bh96P] [^11582Q7A] [^112bGU4q].

> Now, I should outline empiric management pathways while I double-check age and risk-based antibiotic choices. For likely epididymo-orchitis in a man over 35 or with urinary instrumentation, enteric organisms predominate, and fluoroquinolone monotherapy is commonly used; in those at risk for sexually transmitted pathogens, combine ceftriaxone with doxycycline per CDC guidance, with local resistance and renal function considered; I should confirm torsion has been excluded or addressed before delaying antibiotics for imaging [^113c9qu6]. For epididymal or testicular abscess, I need urologic consultation for drainage versus orchiectomy plus targeted antibiotics, as ultrasound features of an avascular cavity with peripheral hyperemia support the diagnosis and diabetics have higher risk of progression [^112GoTS6] [^113Bh96P]. Supportive care includes scrotal elevation, analgesia, and close reassessment for clinical deterioration that might herald necrotizing spread in vulnerable diabetic patients [^116Kp8LT].

> If I suspect Fournier's gangrene, I should not wait for perfect diagnostic certainty. I need to start broad-spectrum IV antibiotics immediately, arrange urgent surgical debridement, and, critically, if the patient is on an SGLT2 inhibitor, discontinue it and provide alternative glycemic therapy as per FDA warnings, because ongoing exposure is discouraged when this diagnosis is suspected or confirmed; I will verify the specific product label guidance for agents like empagliflozin, ertugliflozin, or bexagliflozin to ensure comprehensive counseling and documentation [^113q8nYm] [^111A3Uya] [^115ANtpe] [^1136TsUg]. But wait, fever can be absent in diabetics even with severe infection, so I should not let an afebrile presentation falsely reassure me when local findings and pain are disproportionate [^113YT3hh].

> For torsion, I should confirm rapid urologic exploration rather than relying on imaging if clinical suspicion is high, because time to detorsion determines viability; if imaging is done and shows decreased or absent intratesticular flow with supportive gray-scale features such as horizontal lie or globular enlargement, emergent operative management remains the standard in adults and adolescents alike [^117L1kG2] [^111Hj1LW]. I need to explicitly document the cremasteric reflex and testicular position so we do not miss subtle torsion presentations that can be intermittently reducible or partially torsed with preserved flow [^111Hj1LW].

> I should also address diabetes-specific factors that modulate risk and recovery. Poor glycemic control worsens infection outcomes and healing, and coexisting peripheral and autonomic neuropathy may blunt symptom perception and contribute to atypical presentations, so I need to involve endocrinology or the inpatient diabetes team early for glycemic optimization and neuropathy assessment and management to improve quality of life and recovery trajectory [^112bGU4q] [^111xSKMJ] [^114qwBiG]. Let me reconsider medication reconciliation too; beyond SGLT2 inhibitors, any immunosuppressive agents or steroids could further alter infection dynamics and should be factored into disposition and antibiotic duration decisions [^113q8nYm].

> Finally, I need to define disposition, follow-up, and safety nets. Admit patients with systemic toxicity, concern for necrotizing infection, abscess requiring intervention, inability to exclude torsion, severe pain requiring parenteral therapy, or significant comorbidities like uncontrolled diabetes; coordinate urology and general surgery as appropriate, with infectious disease support for complex or resistant organisms, and ensure interval ultrasound if symptoms persist to exclude an underlying neoplasm masquerading as post-infectious change [^116Kp8LT] [^113Bh96P] [^11582Q7A]. For outpatient cases, I should provide strict return precautions for escalating pain, spreading erythema, fever or rigors, new crepitus, urinary retention, or failure to improve within 48–72 hours, because delays in recognizing torsion or Fournier's gangrene have substantial morbidity costs [^117L1kG2] [^116Kp8LT].

In a 52-year-old male with uncontrolled diabetes and testicular swelling/discomfort, prioritize **Fournier's gangrene** [^116Kp8LT] and **epididymo-orchitis** [^113Bh96P] as top differentials, with testicular torsion [^117L1kG2], abscess [^112GoTS6], hematoma [^114n59eL], tumor [^11582Q7A], and hydrocele/varicocele [^114Jepnx] also considered. Immediate management includes urgent scrotal ultrasound with Doppler [^117L1kG2], CT if necrotizing infection is suspected [^116Kp8LT], and rapid labs (CBC, CRP, glucose, renal function, urinalysis, cultures). Start **broad-spectrum IV antibiotics** [^113q8nYm] (covering gram-negatives and anaerobes), strict glycemic control, and urgent urology/surgery consult; if Fournier's is suspected, proceed to emergency surgical debridement [^113YT3hh]. Delay in diagnosis or treatment can lead to rapid deterioration and high mortality [^116Kp8LT].

## Differential diagnosis

### Infectious etiologies

- **Fournier's gangrene**: Life-threatening necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum/scrotum [^116Kp8LT], rapidly progressive, often polymicrobial, strongly associated with diabetes [^113YT3hh]; presents with severe pain, swelling, erythema, crepitus, systemic toxicity [^113q8nYm].

- **Epididymo-orchitis**: Common in diabetics; presents with testicular swelling, pain, fever, and urinary symptoms; ultrasound shows epididymal enlargement, hyperemia, and possible hydrocele [^113Bh96P].

- **Testicular abscess**: Complication of epididymo-orchitis; ultrasound shows hypoechoic lesions with ill-defined walls and absent internal vascularity [^112GoTS6].

- **Fungal infections (e.g. mucormycosis)**: Rare but severe in uncontrolled diabetes; rapid progression with tissue necrosis.

---

### Non-infectious etiologies

- **Testicular torsion**: Surgical emergency [^117L1kG2]; acute onset severe pain, swelling, absent cremasteric reflex, reduced/absent blood flow on Doppler [^111Hj1LW].

- **Testicular tumor**: Painless swelling/mass; ultrasound shows hypoechoic intratesticular mass; tumor markers (AFP, β-hCG, LDH) may be elevated [^11582Q7A].

- **Hydrocele/varicocele**: Painless swelling; ultrasound shows fluid around testis (hydrocele) or dilated pampiniform plexus (varicocele) [^114Jepnx].

- **Hematoma**: Typically post-trauma [^114n59eL]; ultrasound shows echogenic mass without internal vascularity.

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Clinical assessment

Clinical assessment should include a thorough **history** (onset, duration, severity, trauma, fever, urinary symptoms, sexual history, diabetes control) and a focused **physical examination** assessing testicular tenderness, swelling, erythema, crepitus, and systemic signs such as fever and tachycardia [^117L1kG2].

---

### Laboratory investigations

- **CBC, CRP, ESR**: Assess inflammation/infection.

- **Blood glucose, HbA1c**: Evaluate glycemic control.

- **Urinalysis, urine culture**: Identify urinary pathogens [^113c9qu6].

- **Blood cultures**: If systemic infection suspected [^116Kp8LT].

- **Tumor markers (AFP, β-hCG, LDH)**: If malignancy suspected [^11582Q7A].

---

### Imaging studies

Imaging studies should start with **scrotal ultrasound with Doppler**, the first-line modality [^117L1kG2] to assess blood flow and differentiate torsion, infection, tumor, hydrocele, and hematoma [^111rnJWQ]. If a necrotizing infection (Fournier's) is suspected, obtain a **CT scan** to define disease extent and detect gas in tissues [^116Kp8LT].

---

## Management strategies

### Immediate management

Immediate management includes prompt initiation of **broad-spectrum IV antibiotics** [^113q8nYm] covering gram-negative rods, anaerobes, and MRSA (e.g. piperacillin-tazobactam plus vancomycin). Concurrently, implement strict glucose control with insulin, provide analgesia, and ensure supportive care with fluids and electrolyte management.

---

### Surgical management

For Fournier's gangrene, perform **emergency surgical debridement** without delay, as any postponement increases mortality [^113YT3hh]. Testicular torsion requires immediate surgical exploration with detorsion within 6 hours [^117L1kG2]. Drain abscesses or evacuate hematomas surgically when indicated [^112GoTS6] [^114n59eL].

---

### Long-term management

Long-term management focuses on **optimizing glycemic control** to reduce recurrence and complications, with structured urology follow-up to monitor for recurrence, chronic pain, or infertility. Patient education should emphasize early recognition of infection, hygienic measures, and adherence to diabetes management.

---

## Potential complications

Potential complications include testicular infarction or necrosis after delayed treatment of torsion or severe infection [^117L1kG2], as well as infertility resulting from testicular damage or chronic infection. Necrotizing infections can progress to **sepsis and multi-organ failure** [^116Kp8LT]. Chronic pain and disability may persist due to ongoing inflammation or nerve injury.

---

In a 52-year-old male with uncontrolled diabetes and testicular swelling, **prioritize infectious causes** (Fournier's gangrene, epididymo-orchitis) [^116Kp8LT] [^113c9qu6] and urgent evaluation with ultrasound and labs [^117L1kG2]. Start broad-spectrum antibiotics, control glucose, and obtain surgical consultation promptly; delay risks severe complications and mortality [^113q8nYm].

Testicular abscesses are usually a complication of bacterial epididymo-orchitis. In rare situations, secondary infections of pre-existing hematomas or infarct areas have also been reported. Ultrasound (US) is generally the first imaging modality used for detecting and diagnosing these abscesses. On US, testicular abscesses typically appear as hypoechoic lesions with ill-defined "shaggy" walls. The content of the abscess is mostly heterogeneous, and some movement within this content on gentle compression with the probe may be detected on real-time imaging. Perilesional increased testicular vascularity is frequently observed on color Doppler imaging, and the absence of Doppler signal within the abscess content is a helpful diagnostic sign favoring an abscess over a neoplastic process.

- **Fig. 7**: Testicular abscess. An 18-year-old male with a known neurogenic bladder due to myelomeningocele presented with high fever, right testicular swelling, and severe scrotal pain. A color Doppler US image shows a heterogeneous, hypoechoic lesion (arrows) with no significant internal vascularity. Note was also made of scrotal skin thickening and edema. As the patient was almost septic, an emergent right orchiectomy was performed. Histopathological examination confirmed severe testicular inflammation and abscess formation.

A testicular varicocele represents an abnormal degree of venous dilatation of the pampiniform plexus. It is a relatively common condition and may present as scrotal pain and swelling. An association with male subfertility is an area of debate. This article describes the present-day radiological criteria and imaging techniques to aid in the accurate diagnosis of varicoceles. In addition, the role of the interventional radiologist in treating this condition is discussed.

### Testicular torsion with preserved flow: key sonographic features and value-added approach to diagnosis [^111Hj1LW]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Globular testicular enlargement associated with vascular congestion is a concerning feature for testicular torsion, particularly in the absence of testicular hyperemia, and should not be confused with orchitis. A globular shape can be informative even when testicular measurements do not show a discrepancy, often related to measurement technique. Comparing testicular volumes is more reliable and accurate than discrete size measurements, as evidenced in our cases. A size discrepancy where the affected testis is larger in volume than the asymptomatic side is indicative of potential testicular torsion, akin to the sister sign observed in ovarian torsion.

- **Gray-scale transverse US findings**: In a 13-year-old boy experiencing intermittent left testicular pain for three days, a gray-scale transverse ultrasound image of the left scrotum shows a globular-shaped testis with a horizontal lie, decreased blood flow, and a redundant spermatic cord, alongside a reactive hydrocele. The left testis was found to have a 180° twist with an abnormal epididymal attachment, suggesting bell clapper deformity, which led to bilateral orchiopexy following left detorsion.

- **Gray-scale longitudinal US findings**: In a 16-year-old boy with acute right testicular pain, a gray-scale longitudinal ultrasound image of the right testis reveals a heterogeneous echotexture and decreased blood flow with a redundant spermatic cord. Blood flow returned post-detorsion and bilateral orchiopexy.

### Fournier's gangrene with dapagliflozin in a rural hospital: A case report [^113YT3hh]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

FG is a life-threatening and rapidly progressing necrotising fasciitis of polymicrobial aetiology involving the perineal and genital areas. We have herein presented a case of management of FG, including sequential aggressive debridement procedures and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. Although more commonly described in the literature for men, this is the first published report, to our knowledge, of FG occurring in a woman on an SGLT2 inhibitor.

FG shows vast heterogeneity in clinical presentation, from innocuous cellulitis adjacent to the portal of entry or source of infection, to severe pain, oedema, and systemic features. The patient's chief complaint included discomfort in the perianal area; a large abscess with foul-smelling discharge in the absence of fever was further discovered on physical examination; however, this was not described by the patient as a primary concern. Interestingly, this presentation differs from the FDA warning detailing the symptoms of FG, which include symptoms of tenderness, redness, or swelling of the genitals or the area from the genitals back to the rectum, with an elevated temperature over 100.4°F. Crepitus of the inflamed tissues is also a common feature due to the presence of gas-forming organisms, although it was not present in the evaluated patient. Imaging techniques such as CT scans can be used to confirm diagnosis; however, this was not required in the present case. Laboratory investigations were significant for leucocytosis and neutrophilia, with a white blood cell count of 33.2×10^9/L and a neutrophil count of 29×10^9/L.

### Acute epididymitis in ultrasound: Results of a prospective study with baseline and follow-up investigations in 134 patients [^113Bh96P]. European Journal of Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

To perform a comprehensive follow-up analysis of ultrasonographic scrotal features and associated signs in patients with acute epididymitis, between 2007 and 2012, 134 adults (median age 54 years) with acute epididymitis underwent scrotal ultrasonography and palpation at first presentation and after 2 weeks and 3 months.

At first presentation, 61 patients (45.5%) had hydrocele, 63 (47.0%) had concomitant orchitis, and 8 (5.9%) had epididymal abscess. Epididymitis was predominantly located in 24 cases (17.9%) in the head, 52 cases (38.8%) in the tail, and 58 cases (43.3%) in both. On the affected side, testicular volume was 16.9 ± 6.8 mL and peak systolic velocity of the testicular artery was 23.7 ± 7.5 cm/s, compared to the healthy side with 12.3 ± 4.4 mL and 9.5 ± 3.6 cm/s, respectively (P < 0.001). Concomitant orchitis was associated with hydrocele, testicular enlargement, and pain (P < 0.01). Orchiectomy due to secondary testicular infarction was necessary in four cases, while in all other patients, ultrasound parameters normalized. Only 16 out of 90 patients (17.8%) showed persistent epididymal swelling after 3 months.

Common ultrasound features include hydrocele, epididymal enlargement, hyperperfusion, and testicular involvement. Under conservative treatment, ultrasound parameters normalize without evidence of testicular atrophy, even in patients with epididymal abscess or concomitant orchitis.

### Jardiance [^113q8nYm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Hypoglycemia**: Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia. In adult patients, the risk of hypoglycemia may be increased when Jardiance is used in combination with insulin secretagogues (e.g. sulfonylurea) or insulin. In pediatric patients aged 10 years and older, the risk of hypoglycemia was higher with Jardiance regardless of insulin use [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

	- The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by reducing the dose of sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues) or insulin. Inform patients using these concomitant medications, and pediatric patients, of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia.

- **Necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier's gangrene)**: Reports of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier's gangrene), a rare but serious and life-threatening necrotizing infection requiring urgent surgical intervention, have been identified in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including Jardiance. Cases have been reported in both females and males. Serious outcomes have included hospitalization, multiple surgeries, and death.

	- Patients treated with Jardiance presenting with pain or tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, along with fever or malaise, should be assessed for necrotizing fasciitis. If suspected, start treatment immediately with broad-spectrum antibiotics and, if necessary, surgical debridement. Discontinue Jardiance, closely monitor blood glucose levels, and provide appropriate alternative treatment.

### Infarction of paratesticular inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor mimicking testicular torsion [^112NCrWh]. Urology (2023). High credibility.

This report describes a 14-year-old male with a rare paratesticular inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor that presented atypically with acute unilateral scrotal pain and swelling. This presentation, which raised suspicion for testicular torsion, contrasts with the typical presentation of a slow-growing scrotal mass. Scrotal exploration revealed an infarcted right testis, demonstrating that this locally aggressive tumor can undergo vascular invasion and occlude testicular blood supply. Thus, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor should be considered in the differential diagnosis when evaluating patients with acute scrotal pain suspicious for testicular infarction.

A 49-year-old male of Afro-Caribbean origin with a background of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, high body mass index of 40, and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) secondary to focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), which was diagnosed in 2007 and treated with only 1 month of corticosteroids, presented to our peritoneal dialysis (PD) unit in July 2019. He reported mild abdominal discomfort and noted cloudy PD effluent. This patient had been on PD for 4 years and experienced one previous episode of PD peritonitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus, which required catheter replacement 2 years prior.

At the time of presentation, the PD regimen consisted of automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) lasting 8.5 hours with 5 cycles of 3-liter fills. The dialysate fluid included 10 liters of 1.36% glucose concentration and 5 liters of 2.27% glucose concentration, with an extraneal (Icodextrin 7.5%) solution as a last fill of 1.7 liters. He also received an Opti exchange of 2.0 liters of 1.36% solution in the evenings.

### Assessing brain tissue viability on nonenhanced computed tomography after ischemic stroke [^114YgJsw]. Stroke (2023). High credibility.

Treatment for ischemic stroke can be offered beyond conventional time limits for patients with favorable computed tomography perfusion (CTP), but this is not universally available. We sought a threshold for brain attenuation on nonenhanced computed tomography (NECT) to differentiate CTP-defined penumbra versus core and correlated NECT features with CTP.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively assessed consecutive patients presenting to King Abdulaziz University Hospital with ischemic stroke during 2017–2020. Baseline NECT and a visible defect on conCTP were recorded. Using CTP as the reference standard, we measured the attenuation of ischemic and healthy contralateral brain on NECT to produce attenuation ratios (ischemic/normal) for penumbra and core. We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve to estimate the optimal computed tomography (CT) attenuation ratio for the penumbra. Per patient, we qualitatively assessed eight regions within the affected cerebral hemisphere. These were assessed on NECT as normal, hypoattenuating (with or without swelling), or isolated swelling, and on CTP as normal, penumbra, or core. We sought associations between isolated swelling and penumbra, and between hypoattenuation and core.

- **Results**: We included 142 patients (86 male) with a mean age of 61 ± 14 years. The median time to NECT was 261 minutes (interquartile range, 173–382). A total of 206 ischemic lesions were measured (124 penumbra, 82 core). The optimal CT attenuation ratio for identifying the penumbra was > 0.87, with 86% sensitivity and 91% specificity (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.92–0.98]; P < 0.0001).

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^111xSKMJ]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetes mellitus type 2, and more specifically with respect to screening for diabetic neuropathy, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend assessing for symptoms and signs of autonomic neuropathy (such as orthostatic dizziness, syncope, resting tachycardia, early satiety, erectile dysfunction, changes in sweating patterns, or dry cracked skin in the extremities) starting at diagnosis and at least annually thereafter. This is particularly emphasized in patients with evidence of other microvascular complications, especially kidney disease and diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

### Conservative therapy is associated with worse clinical features and biochemical derangements than renal replacement therapy: a retrospective study in Kumasi, Ghana [^112v8nbz]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Low credibility.

This study compared the sociodemographic features, diagnostic characteristics (clinical, biochemical, and imaging), and clinical outcomes of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients who chose either renal replacement therapy (RRT) or conservative therapy, as well as the factors that influenced their choice. Bipedal swelling (16.8%), fatigue (10.4%), and facial swelling (9.2%) were the major clinical features. Chronic glomerulonephritis (31.4%), hypertension (30.3%), and diabetes mellitus nephropathy (28.2%) were the most frequent predisposing conditions.

Nifedipine (82.0%), bisoprolol (32.8%), aspirin (19.7%), ranitidine (26.2%), metformin (13.1%), and Lasix (78.7%) were commonly used by the RRT patients compared to their conservative therapy counterparts. Conversely, patients on conservative therapy were more commonly on irbesartan/lisinopril (57.9%) and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) (52.0%).

- **Clinical outcomes**: Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (p = 0.047), uremic gastritis (p = 0.007), anemia, uremia, hematuria, and hyperkalemia (p < 0.001) were more common in conservative therapy patients than in RRT patients. RRT patients exhibited better corticomedullary differentiation (38.1% vs. 27.7%, p < 0.001) and normal echotexture (15.0% vs. 11.6%, p = 0.005).

In agreement with previous studies, the majority of our participants were aged 40–69 years with a male predominance. ESKD is known to occur in advanced ages where risk factors are high with more comorbidities. The male predominance is likely due to hypertension, a major risk factor that occurs more in males than females, with uncontrolled blood pressure often observed in males.

### Successful management of 30 kg gigantic para-testicular liposarcoma [^116JFENV]. BMC Urology (2023). High credibility.

A 62-year-old male presented at our urology outpatient clinic with a painless giant swelling of the left scrotum, which had slowly progressed over a period of three years. He occasionally experienced bleeding from a trophic ulcer at the bottom of the swelling. Clinically, the scrotum appeared pear-shaped and measured approximately 60 × 40 cm. A 5 × 5 cm trophic ulcer was visible at the bottom of the scrotum and was not bleeding at the time of presentation. His only pre-existing condition was bilateral varicose veins. Additionally, the penis was buried within the scrotal mass, as illustrated in Figure 1.

- **Figure 1**:
	- A & B: Preoperative anterior and lateral views
	- C: Result at the end of the surgery
	- D: Trophic ulcer at the bottom of the scrotum

A physical examination of the right testis and the penis could not be conducted because of the left testicular mass. These organs were only identifiable via ultrasound. An ultrasound of the left testis revealed an enormous cystic, solid tumour completely replacing the left testis. Neither preoperative clinical examinations nor postoperative staging computed tomography (CT) scans indicated metastatic spread, although a few enlarged lymph nodes were observed in the bilateral inguinal areas and the right iliac area, each measuring approximately 2 × 1 cm. Preoperative serum tumor markers were within normal limits. A left-sided high inguinal orchiectomy was performed, with complete removal of the tumour and a primary complex closure of the wound (Picture 1). Intraoperatively, the right testis was successfully spared. Postoperative pathological examinations diagnosed a dedifferentiated liposarcoma.

### ACR appropriateness criteria: Acute onset of scrotal pain without trauma, without antecedent mass [^117L1kG2]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). High credibility.

An acute scrotum is defined as testicular swelling with acute pain and can reflect multiple etiologies, including epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis, torsion of the spermatic cord, or torsion of the testicular appendages. Quick and accurate diagnosis of acute scrotum and its etiology with imaging is necessary because a delayed diagnosis of torsion for as little as six hours can cause irreparable testicular damage. Ultrasound duplex Doppler of the scrotum is usually appropriate as the initial imaging for the acute onset of scrotal pain without trauma or antecedent mass in an adult or child.

The American College of Radiology's appropriateness criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

- **Mass-forming testicular abscess**: A 69-year-old male presented with recent onset of right testicular pain and a palpable mass. The gray scale US image shows a heterogeneous mass with ill-defined borders and central cystic areas. The imaging appearance was concerning for a paratesticular sarcoma infiltrating the testicular parenchyma. Orchiectomy revealed no evidence of malignant disease but an organized testicular abscess with paratesticular extension.

- **Testicular choriocarcinoma**: A 25-year-old male with an unremarkable past medical history presented with a right testicular palpable mass and mild tenderness. Color Doppler US shows a large heterogeneous solid mass with no apparent internal vascularity on the color Doppler study. Differential diagnoses based on the US findings were necrotic testicular tumor, testicular hematoma, or testicular abscess. As the concomitant serum beta-hCG levels were extremely high (150,000 mlU/mL), testicular choriocarcinoma was considered the leading diagnosis. Histopathological examination confirmed testicular choriocarcinoma.

A 59-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes and a left nephrectomy following trauma reported malaise and weakness. He had a penile ulcer two months earlier, but there had been no lymphadenopathy or fever. His speech was slurred, and he was breathless on minimal exertion, with ankle swelling. Twenty-four hours later, he developed a generalized maculopapular rash. Laboratory investigation confirmed syphilis and nephrotic syndrome. He was treated with a single injection of benzylpenicillin, following which there was a rapid and complete recovery. The temporal association and improvement with treatment suggest that syphilis caused his illness. The incidence of syphilis is increasing, and doctors should remain alert to syphilis as a possible cause of nephrotic syndrome.

A 67-year-old man is referred for evaluation and management of possible hypogonadism. He reports that his libido has declined over the last 10 years, but his predominant sexual complaints are that his erections have gradually become less firm, resulting in decreased sexual satisfaction. Additionally, he reports fatigue and "feeling washed out" on most days. His wife sleeps in another room because he snores very loudly, and she reports that he has occasional gasping for breath when sleeping. He reports a low mood that has worsened since retirement two years ago.

His comorbidities include obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) diagnosed five years ago, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. He is sedentary and has a 30-pack-year history of smoking, but quit smoking five years ago. He has no history of previous myocardial infarction or stroke. He was hospitalized briefly for the treatment of viral pneumonia about 10 weeks ago. His medications include lisinopril, atorvastatin, metformin, and sitagliptin. He has never used glucocorticoids, opioids, or anabolic steroids. He reports no bruising tendency, weakness, headaches, or visual disturbance. He has fathered two children (now adults) without difficulty and recalls normal puberty at "about the same time as his friends".

On physical examination, his blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg, weight is 99.3 kg (219 lb), and BMI is 31.3 kg/m². He has normal body hair and lipomastia but no palpable gynecomastia. His genital exam is normal, with testes measuring 20 cc each by Prader orchidometry. Pedal pulses are reduced. The remainder of the examination is unremarkable.

### Trousseau syndrome presenting with penile gangrene [^113sPAbp]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

A 64-year-old Chinese man with poorly controlled, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia was referred for a 2-month history of glans penis gangrene. He had no known drug allergies. The patient had a history of prostate adenocarcinoma with bony metastases [stage T3, N4, M1, Gleason 9 (score 4+5)], serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels of 272 μg/L (normal range, 0–4 μg/L) and had undergone bilateral subcapsular orchidectomy 6 years ago, resulting in an improvement of serum PSA levels to 0.8 μg/L postoperatively. He defaulted follow-up for 5 years and re-presented with castrate-resistant prostate cancer with a PSA of 126.6 μg/L. He was started on bicalutamide (antiandrogen) tablets.

The penile lesions began as painful erosions surrounding the penile meatus, which gradually became necrotic over 2 months. There were no vesicles or bullae present. The patient attempted to self-medicate with topical Baneocin powder (Bacitracin Zinc, Neomycin Sulfate). He also experienced worsening pain and required multiple courses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and tramadol. He denied any urinary symptoms or systemic symptoms before or during the onset of the erosions, and there were no recent changes in his regular medication. His last sexual contact was more than 10 years ago.

Clinically, the patient was afebrile and exhibited near-circumferential dry gangrene involving the glans penis associated with severe swelling of the foreskin and paraphimosis. The penile shaft and scrotal skin were unremarkable, with no significant dermatologic signs elsewhere.

### Identifying the deceiver: the non-neoplastic mimickers of genital system neoplasms [^114n59eL]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Testicular hematoma

Intratesticular hematomas can be observed in trauma cases, and the diagnosis is generally straightforward in these patients. However, incidental diagnosis of testicular tumors following trauma is not uncommon and has been reported in 10–15% of patients with a history of scrotal trauma. Follow-up imaging is necessary in these patients to document resolution, exclude incidental tumors, and detect secondary complications related to intratesticular hematomas. Surgical exploration may be needed for large-sized hematomas to prevent testicular necrosis and compressive parenchymal atrophy.

Testicular hematomas can appear as single or multiple lesions of variable sizes. Sonographic findings tend to vary depending on the age of the hematoma. A characteristic finding is the detection of an iso-hyperechoic mass in the acute phase, and differentiating the hematoma from the healthy parenchyma may be challenging. Unlike neoplastic masses, internal vascularity is not expected in hematomas with color Doppler US. However, peripherally increased vascularity can be seen in infected hematomas. In the resolution phase, hematomas may appear as hypoechoic lesions with a gradual decrease in size over serial follow-up examinations. Concomitant scrotal trauma findings, such as tunica albuginea disruption, testicular fracture, hematocele, and scrotal wall hematoma, can facilitate the differential diagnosis.

Temporal variation of the hematoma morphology may be better detected with MRI. While T1 hyperintensity is expected in the subacute period, a low T2 signal due to hemosiderin deposition is expected.

A 52-year-old male with a history of Cushing's disease at age 18 and bilateral adrenalectomy at age 23 presented with visual changes. An MRI scan showed a pituitary macroadenoma (Nelson's syndrome). Other than the development of diabetes mellitus at age 32, his disease was stable until presentation. Serum studies show markedly elevated ACTH levels, but he had no hyperpigmentation. The tumor was removed by endoscopic surgery. Microscopic examination showed a pituitary adenoma with strong immunostaining for ACTH. In addition, the tumor cells showed Crooke's hyaline change and stained strongly for cytokeratin (Crooke's cell adenoma). Normal pituitary tissue was not present. Crooke's cell adenomas are extremely rare and have not been previously reported in Nelson's syndrome.

### Penile and scrotal oedema along with urinary retention after insulin therapy [^116wSC7m]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Insulin oedema is a rare complication of insulin treatment characterized by an absence of heart, liver, and renal involvement. It typically develops in the lower extremities or, less frequently, as generalized oedema after the initiation of insulin therapy. We report a 59-year-old man with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes who developed oedema in his penis and scrotum accompanied by weight gain following intensive insulin therapy. His oedema improved following a reduction of the daily insulin injection dose and treatment for urinary retention. Penile and scrotal oedema is a rare physical finding for patients with diabetes. Therefore, in patients with poorly controlled diabetes who have started insulin therapy, physicians should pay attention to urinary retention and not miss changes in weight gain or oedema in the lower body, including the perineal region.

### Reproduction disrupts stem cell homeostasis in testes of aged male Drosophila via an induced microenvironment [^115XwMfp]. PLoS Genetics (2019). Low credibility.

Stem cells rely on instructive cues from their environment, and alterations in microenvironments might contribute to tissue dysfunction and disease pathogenesis. Germline stem cells (GSCs) and cyst stem cells (CySCs) in Drosophila testes are normally maintained in the apical area by the testicular hub. In this study, we found that reproduction leads to the accumulation of early differentiating daughters of CySCs and GSCs in the testes of aged male flies due to hyperactivation of Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling. This signaling maintains self-renewal gene expression in the differentiating cyst cells. JNK activity is normally required to maintain CySCs in the apical niche.

A muscle sheath surrounds the Drosophila testis to maintain its long coiled structure. Importantly, reproduction triggers the accumulation of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) Eiger in the testis muscle, activating JNK signaling via the TNF receptor Grindelwald in the cyst cells. Reducing Eiger activity in the testis muscle sheath suppressed reproduction-induced differentiation defects but had little effect on testis homeostasis of unmated males. Our results reveal that reproduction in males provokes a dramatic shift in the testicular microenvironment, impairing tissue homeostasis and spermatogenesis in the testes.

### Imaging in paratesticular lesions [^112SgvSQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

A 23-year-old male presented with complaints of gradually increasing swelling of the left hemiscrotum. A preliminary ultrasound scan revealed a heterogeneous, predominantly solid lesion showing raised internal vascularity with a few cystic areas in the paratesticular region, towards the midline, with both testes seen separately from the lesion. To rule out the presence of locoregional or distant metastases, a CT scan was done, revealing a well-defined, intrascrotal, extratesticular, heterogeneous, moderately enhancing mass lesion with cystic areas in the scrotal sac, with no significant lymphadenopathy or obvious distant metastasis. Subsequent MRI done for surgical planning revealed a heterogeneous signal intensity lesion with cystic areas and areas of hemorrhage, with focal loss of fat planes with the left corpora cavernosa at the root of the penis. The patient underwent an inguinoscrotal exploration with excision of the left paratesticular mass. Final histopathology suggested an undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma.

Paratesticular tumors, while rare, are an important cause of scrotal swelling. Exact histological identification of the tumor subtype is not possible based on imaging, but preoperative multi-modality imaging has an important role in identifying the tissue of origin, differentiating benign from malignant lesions, surgical planning, and assessing the need for adjuvant CT/RT.

### A case study of a patient with diabetic retinopathy [^1147F2ia]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2016). Low credibility.

The patient in this report is a 52-year-old male driver who was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) five years ago, initially without diabetic retinopathy. The patient was monitored over two intervals. It was at the second interval that he was diagnosed with proliferative retinopathy. Notably, the progression from the first sign of retinopathy, which appeared between the first and second intervals, to the point at which the patient lost vision in the left eye, occurred within a year.

In this work, we introduce a previously overlooked factor: the type of profession. This factor, which contributes to occupational stress, plays an important role in the progression of proliferative retinopathy. We speculate that this factor can dramatically accelerate the progression of the disease, even when other risk factors are not present.

### A rare complication of diabetes mellitus in a 65-year-old man [^114J7gEY]. Journal of Diabetes and its Complications (2008). Low credibility.

Spontaneous diabetic myonecrosis is a rare complication of diabetes mellitus, primarily affecting the thigh and calf muscles. It presents with acute leg pain, without any evidence of systemic illness. Diagnosis can often be difficult and delayed. Here, we report a case of a 65-year-old man presenting with this complication.

### Diabetic muscle infarction and diabetic dermopathy: Two manifestations of uncontrolled prolong diabetes mellitus presenting with severe leg pain and leg skin lesions [^113oiRXQ]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Diabetic muscular infarction (DMI) is a rare condition observed in patients with long-standing diabetes, typically alongside other complications associated with poor glycemic control. It has been reported using various terminologies such as aseptic myonecrosis, ischemic myonecrosis, and tumoriform focal muscular degeneration.

DMI was first described by Angervall and Stener in 1965. It presents as an acute onset of painful swelling in the affected muscle. MRI and biopsy histology can help differentiate it from other similar conditions. Despite being recognized for over 45 years, fewer than 200 cases have been reported.

We present a rare manifestation of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes in a patient who experienced pain, swelling, and a palpable tender mass in one leg, along with new skin lesions.

### Reproduction disrupts stem cell homeostasis in testes of aged male Drosophila via an induced microenvironment [^113Ga2Uc]. PLoS Genetics (2019). Low credibility.

Stem cells rely on instructive cues from their environment. Alterations in microenvironments might contribute to tissue dysfunction and disease pathogenesis. Germline stem cells (GSCs) and cyst stem cells (CySCs) in Drosophila testes are normally maintained in the apical area by the testicular hub.

In this study, we found that reproduction leads to the accumulation of early differentiating daughters of CySCs and GSCs in the testes of aged male flies, due to hyperactivation of Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling. This signaling is essential to maintain self-renewal gene expression in the differentiating cyst cells. JNK activity is normally required to maintain CySCs in the apical niche. A muscle sheath surrounds the Drosophila testis to maintain its long coiled structure. Importantly, reproduction triggers the accumulation of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) Eiger in the testis muscle to activate JNK signaling via the TNF receptor Grindelwald in the cyst cells.

Reducing Eiger activity in the testis muscle sheath suppressed reproduction-induced differentiation defects but had little effect on testis homeostasis of unmated males. Our results reveal that reproduction in males provokes a dramatic shift in the testicular microenvironment, which impairs tissue homeostasis and spermatogenesis in the testes.

### Transient neonatal diabetes mellitus, type 4, type 1 diabetes mellitus, or MODY: Which disease is it, anyway [^112MunJT]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

A 30-year-old Hispanic male who presented with transient neonatal diabetes mellitus at 4 months has been intensively studied with 12 islet-cell secretagogues from 4 months to 24 years. He was both ICA- and GAD-65-negative, but at 28 years was diagnosed with hypothyroidism due to positive thyroperoxidase antibodies. The course of his disease(s) and the various presentations of hyperglycemia are documented and illustrated by the responses in islet cell hormone secretion — namely, insulin, glucagon, and C-peptide. Insulin secretion gradually fell over 24 years; glucagon secretion persisted from infancy to 24 years but was only minimal during intravenous glucose at 24 years; and C-peptide secretion remained normal, although modest, throughout the 24 years. These data suggest that, despite changing presentations of diabetes mellitus over time, the islets continued to process proinsulin, although the patient required insulin therapy.

### Spermatic cord abscess: A rare complication of epididymo-orchitis, the diagnosis and management [^111oYqfK]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

We present a case of a 54-year-old man with a history of poorly controlled diabetes and end-stage renal failure on haemodialysis. He presented with an acute left groin swelling, diagnosed as a rare occurrence of spermatic cord abscess. Two months prior, he experienced an episode of bacterial epididymo-orchitis, which was treated with oral antibiotics. An urgent CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed to rule out an incarcerated inguinal hernia.

The spermatic cord abscess was initially managed with appropriate intravenous antibiotics and ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage. When pus eventually accumulated in the scrotum, an open incision and drainage of the scrotum were performed. He achieved complete resolution after 2 months.

### Metronidazole [^111HzDSH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility**: Tumors affecting the liver, lung, mammary, and lymphatic tissues have been detected in several studies of metronidazole in rats and mice, but not in hamsters. Pulmonary tumors have been observed in all six reported studies in mice, including one study in which the animals were dosed on an intermittent schedule (administration during every fourth week only). Malignant tumors were increased in male mice treated at approximately 1500 mg/m² (similar to the maximum recommended daily dose, based on body surface area comparisons). Malignant lymphomas and pulmonary neoplasms were also increased with lifelong feeding of the drug to mice. Mammary and hepatic tumors were increased among female rats administered oral metronidazole compared to controls. Two lifetime tumorigenicity studies in hamsters have been performed and reported to be negative.

Metronidazole has shown mutagenic activity with in vitro assay systems, including the Ames test. Studies in mammals in vivo have failed to demonstrate a potential for genetic damage.

Metronidazole failed to produce any adverse effects on fertility or testicular function in male rats at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day (approximately 2 times the maximum recommended daily dose based on body surface area comparison) for 28 days. However, rats treated at the same dose for 6 weeks or longer were infertile and showed severe degeneration of the seminiferous epithelium in the testes, as well as marked decreases in testicular spermatid counts and epididymal sperm counts. Fertility was restored after cessation of treatment.

### A 74-year-old woman with diabetes [^112528hz]. JAMA (2007). Low credibility.

Ms. M, a 74-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes of 6 years' duration, has a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) value of 7.4% despite taking three oral antidiabetic medications, as well as having coexistent hypertension and abdominal obesity. She has no known microvascular or macrovascular complications of diabetes and is otherwise healthy. She is reluctant to commence insulin treatment as she dislikes the idea of injections and wonders if there are any alternate options if she is to get her HbA1C value below 7%. The natural history of type 2 diabetes, reasons why many patients begin requiring insulin over time, the rationale for tight glycemic control, and therapeutic options for Ms. M are discussed.

### Giant angiomyofibroblastoma of the scrotum: A case report and review of the literature [^11594dK1]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

This case report was approved by the Institutional Ethics Review Board of Hami Central Hospital, affiliated with Xinjiang Medical University (LLY2024072412). The patient provided written informed consent for the study and publication of this report.

A 59-year-old male patient was admitted to the Department of Urology at the hospital, presenting with a 2-year history of left scrotal swelling, initially diagnosed as left testicular swelling. The patient, a herdsman from a remote mountain village with a low level of education, paid little attention to his health issues until the swelling significantly impacted his life. He has no history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, or other diseases. The patient's body mass index (BMI) was 25 kg/m².

Physical examination revealed no elevation in the kidney area or suprapubic region. The kidneys were not palpable, and there was no tenderness in the costal ridge, costal lumbar, upper ureteral, quarterly costal, or middle ureteral areas. The bladder was positioned below the pubic bone without tenderness or pressure. Auscultation revealed no abnormalities in the renal regions. The left scrotum was enlarged with a palpable mass measuring 25 × 15 cm, characterized by a tough, smooth surface and clear boundary. The left testis was not palpable, and the transillumination test result was negative.

### Management of chronic testalgia by microsurgical testicular denervation [^117Art9q]. European Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic testicular pain (CTP) is defined as unilateral or bilateral, intermittent or continuous testicular discomfort lasting at least 3 months, which interferes with the patient's daily activities and prompts him to seek medical advice. It is a rather common urological manifestation of chronic pain syndrome. Diagnosis and treatment of CTP have been difficult and often unrewarding clinical situations. Success rates of conservative and surgical measures, including epididymectomy and orchiectomy, rarely exceed 55–73% and 10–40%, respectively. We report our experience with microsurgical testicular denervation as a therapeutic option for CTP.

Following an extensive preoperative work-up, which included urine/semen cultures, transrectal ultrasound, testicular sonography, and pain and orthopedic consultation, no pathological abnormalities were revealed. A positive response to spermatic cord block was observed. Consequently, 35 patients underwent microsurgical testicular denervation. In brief, the spermatic cord was dissected, and the vas deferens, cremasteric muscle, and testicular vessels were separated. After identification of the testicular artery by applying vasodilating agents and using magnifying loops or the operating microscope, all structures except the testicular artery, vas deferens, and 1–2 lymphatic vessels were coagulated and transected using bipolar diathermy.

After a mean follow-up of 31.5 months, 34 out of 35 (96%) patients are completely pain-free. No intra- or postoperative complications were encountered, and no cases of testicular atrophy or hydrocele formation were observed during the postoperative period.

### Qtern [^111C98Kc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Hypoglycemia with concomitant use of insulin or insulin secretagogues**: Insulin and insulin secretagogues, such as sulfonylureas, are known to cause hypoglycemia. Both dapagliflozin and saxagliptin can individually increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin or an insulin secretagogue [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when these agents are used in combination with Qtern.

- **Necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier's gangrene)**: Reports of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier's gangrene), a rare but serious and life-threatening necrotizing infection requiring urgent surgical intervention, have been identified in postmarketing surveillance in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. Cases have been reported in both females and males. Serious outcomes have included hospitalization, multiple surgeries, and death.

	- Patients treated with Qtern presenting with pain or tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, along with fever or malaise, should be assessed for necrotizing fasciitis. If suspected, start treatment immediately with broad-spectrum antibiotics and, if necessary, surgical debridement. Discontinue Qtern, closely monitor blood glucose levels, and provide appropriate alternative therapy for glycemic control.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with saxagliptin.

### Cross-sectional imaging of complicated urinary infections affecting the lower tract and male genital organs [^116Kp8LT]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Fournier's gangrene (FG) is a rare, life-threatening necrotizing polymicrobial infection of the perineal, perianal, and genital structures, commonly occurring in diabetics, with a striking male predominance (male-to-female ratio, 10:1). FG may further complicate a lower UTI, or originate from different infections such as colorectal infections, anal fistulas, or pressure ulceration. Clinical presentation includes local pain, swollen edematous or gangrenous overlying skin, sometimes with appreciable crepitus, and progressive hyperthermia. FG represents a surgical emergency: aggressive surgical debridement and broad-spectrum antibiotics are required to prevent a fatal outcome.

CT is by far the best modality for imaging FG; it quickly and comprehensively visualizes the extent of FG involvement. CT features include subcutaneous fat stranding at the involved areas, fascial thickening, superficial or deep fluid, and air-attenuation collections. Subcutaneous emphysema produced by anaerobic bacteria is the hallmark of FG and is present in approximately 90% of cases. Furthermore, CT can define the starting point of the infectious process, thereby allowing differentiation of complicated perineal infections from urinary versus an alternative source, particularly cryptogenic perianal sepsis.

Clinically, FG may present as clinically unsuspected but can be diagnosed with imaging. Surgical intervention is typically necessary, especially in patients demonstrating symptoms like scrotal swelling and recurrent urinary tract infections (reUTIs). Initial ultrasound may depict prominent inflammatory thickening in such cases.

### Fenofibrate [^113uMLSU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Two dietary carcinogenicity studies have been conducted in rats with fenofibrate. In the first 24-month study, rats were dosed with fenofibrate at 10, 45, and 200 mg/kg/day, approximately 0.3, 1, and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), based on body surface area comparisons (mg/m²).

At a dose of 200 mg/kg/day (at 6 times the MRHD), the incidence of liver carcinomas was significantly increased in both sexes. A statistically significant increase in pancreatic carcinomas was observed in males at 1 and 6 times the MRHD, and an increase in pancreatic adenomas and benign testicular interstitial cell tumors was observed at 6 times the MRHD in males.

In a second 24-month rat carcinogenicity study in a different strain of rats, doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg/day (0.3 and 2 times the MRHD) produced significant increases in the incidence of pancreatic acinar adenomas in both sexes and increases in testicular interstitial cell tumors in males at 2 times the MRHD.

A 117-week carcinogenicity study was conducted in rats comparing three drugs: fenofibrate 10 and 60 mg/kg/day (0.3 and 2 times the MRHD), clofibrate (400 mg/kg/day; 2 times the human dose), and gemfibrozil (250 mg/kg/day; 2 times the human dose, based on mg/m² surface area). Fenofibrate increased pancreatic acinar adenomas in both sexes. Clofibrate increased hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic acinar adenomas in males and hepatic neoplastic nodules in females. Gemfibrozil increased hepatic neoplastic nodules in males and females, while all three drugs increased testicular tumors.

### Bilateral adrenal and testicular tumours; when a simple diagnosis becomes complicated [^112KndBE]. Urology (2023). Low credibility.

A 78-year-old man with a BMI of 28.7, moon face, and a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, undefined adrenal insufficiency, and a history of cardiac ablation, had been in urological follow-up for both prostate and bladder cancer. PSA levels remained low after radiation and adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Cystoscopy revealed no recurrence after transurethral resection of bladder tumour and instillation of BCG.

A routine CT scan, as indicated by EAU guidelines, showed bilateral enlargement of the adrenal glands as the only de novo abnormality. The patient had no other symptoms aside from long-standing fatigue. Considering the patient's medical history, an FDG PET scan was subsequently performed, revealing intense FDG uptake not only bilaterally in the adrenal glands but also in both testes. An ultrasound of the testes demonstrated hypodense lesions with increased flow. This imaging raised the suspicion of testicular adrenal rest tumours. Differential diagnoses included primary testis tumour, metastatic disease, BCG-itis, lymphoma, or rare endocrine disorders.

The combination of bilateral adrenal gland hyperplasia and testicular masses prompted consideration of the rare diagnosis of ectopic adrenal remnant in both testes with Cushing-like features. Endocrinological evaluation could not establish an all-encompassing diagnosis to explain all clinical findings. Bilateral orchidectomy was performed, and histological examination showed localization of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in both testes. The patient was referred to the haematologist and started chemotherapy, specifically R-CHOP.

### Sirolimus [^111LseSC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Nonclinical toxicology**:

	- **Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility**: Carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats. In an 86-week female mouse study, at sirolimus doses 30 to 120 times higher than the 2 mg daily clinical dose (adjusted for body surface area), there was a statistically significant increase in malignant lymphoma at all dose levels compared with controls. In a second mouse study, at dosages approximately 3 to 16 times the clinical dose (adjusted for body surface area), hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma in males were considered sirolimus-related. In the 104-week rat study, at dosages equal to or lower than the clinical dose of 2 mg daily (adjusted for body surface area), there were no significant findings.

	- Sirolimus was not genotoxic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay, the Chinese hamster ovary cell chromosomal aberration assay, the mouse lymphoma cell forward mutation assay, or the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay.

	- When female rats were treated by oral gavage with sirolimus and mated to untreated males, female fertility was decreased at 0.5 mg/kg (2.5-fold the clinical dose of 2 mg, on a body surface area basis) due to decreased implantation. Additionally, reduced ovary and uterus weight were observed. The NOAEL for female rat fertility was 0.1 mg/kg (0.5-fold the clinical dose of 2 mg).

	- When male rats were treated by oral gavage with sirolimus and mated to untreated females, male fertility was decreased at 2 mg/kg (9.7-fold the clinical dose of 2 mg, on a body surface area basis). Atrophy of testes and epididy was also noted.

### Cord structure within an inguinal hernia: Could the ureter be involved [^1124maWW]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

A male patient in his 60s presented to the outpatient surgery clinic with a left-sided inguinoscrotal swelling. The swelling was noted by the patient around one and a half years ago and has been progressively increasing in size ever since. The patient reported that the swelling was not painful but caused dull discomfort. The bulge was more apparent with vigorous exercise and when lifting heavy objects. Review of systems was negative for weight loss, fever, nausea, vomiting, or change in bowel habits, and also negative for any lower urinary tract symptoms.

Medical history was positive for primary hypertension, diagnosed three years ago. He had a transcatheter aortic valve implantation six months prior to presenting and a follow-up colonoscopy two months prior, which showed malignant polyps excised by endoscopic mucosal resection. He was only on a daily 2.5 mg tablet of amlodipine for his well-controlled hypertension. Social history revealed that he is a non-smoker, non-drinker, physically active, and resides with his family.

Vital signs were all within normal range. His body mass index (BMI) was 32.3 kg/m², which is classified as class I obesity. Physical examination revealed a soft, non-tender, fatty abdomen with no hepatosplenomegaly. A focused examination of the groin showed a large left-sided bulge above the inguinal ligament, extending towards his scrotum. No bulge was noted on the right side or in the femoral region. Head raise and cough impulse enhanced the bulge. The swelling was partially reducible.

A 14-year-old male, a diagnosed case of type 1 diabetes mellitus for one year, presented with uncontrolled blood glucose levels, non-compliance with insulin therapy, and readmissions with diabetic ketoacidosis. His blood glucose levels were difficult to control with broad fluctuations in insulin requirements. He had absent secondary sexual characteristics and hepatomegaly. Liver biopsy showed macrovesicular steatosis without fibrosis or inflammation, with many glycogenated nuclei present. He was started on intensive insulin therapy, which led to subsequent regression of hepatomegaly and the onset of a pubertal spurt.

### Differential evolution of diabetic ketoacidosis in adults with pre-existent versus newly diagnosed type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus [^117LENAe]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) was once known to be specific to type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D); however, many cases are now seen in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Little is known about how this etiological shift affects DKA's outcomes.

- **Methods**: We studied consecutive index DKA admissions from January 2015 to March 2021. Descriptive analyses were performed based on pre-existing T1D and T2D (PT1D and PT2D, respectively) and newly diagnosed T1D and T2D (NT1D and NT2D, respectively).

- **Results**: Of the 922 patients, 480 (52%) had T1D, of which 69% had PT1D and 31% NT1D; whereas 442 (48%) had T2D, of which 60% had PT2D and 40% NT2D. The mean age was highest in PT2D (47.6 ± 13.1 years) and lowest in PT1D (27.3 ± 0.5 years) (P < 0.001). Patients in all groups were predominantly male except in the PT1D group (55% females) (P < 0.001). Most patients were Arabic (76% in PT1D, 51.4% in NT1D, 46.6% in PT2D), except for NT2D, which mainly comprised Asians (53%) (P < 0.001). Patients with NT2D had the longest hospital length of stay (LOS) (6.8 ± 11.3 days) (P < 0.001), longest DKA duration (26.6 ± 21.1 hours) (P < 0.001), and more intensive care unit (ICU) admissions (31.2%) (P < 0.001). In contrast, patients with PT1D had the shortest LOS (2.5 ± 3.5 days) (P < 0.001), DKA duration (18.9 ± 4.2 hours) (P < 0.001), and lowest ICU admissions (16.6%) (P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions/interpretation**: We presented the largest regional data on differences in DKA based on the type and duration of diabetes mellitus (DM), showing that T2D is becoming an increasing cause of DKA, with worse clinical outcomes.

### Does color Doppler sonography improve the clinical assessment of patients with acute scrotum [^111rnJWQ]. European Journal of Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Our experience concerning the use of color Doppler sonography (CDS) in the differential diagnosis of acute scrotum is reported. From July 2000 to July 2005, 155 patients (median age 17.2 years) were admitted with a diagnosis of acute scrotum (unilateral in 150 cases, bilateral in 5). Along with a careful anamnesis and physical exam, all patients underwent a CDS study of the scrotal content using a GE Logiq 500 sonograph with a multifrequency (7.5–10 MHz) linear probe for small parts.

- **CDS parameters**: The intensity of the color-power signal on the testicular parenchyma and the epididymis, as well as the systolic peak velocity (SPV) and telediastolic velocity (TDV) in correspondence of the gonadal hilum, were evaluated. Ultrasound and flowmetry parameters registered on the painful testis were compared with those registered on the healthy contralateral testis. The reduction/absence versus the increase of color-power signal in the parenchyma and SPV and TDV in the centripetal intratesticular arteries were considered presumptive of testicular torsion versus orchiepididymitis.

The results only refer to the 150 patients (300 testes) with acute unilateral scrotum. The clinical picture and physical exam suggested a torsion of the spermatic cord in 40 cases, a spontaneous de-torsion in 5, orchiepididymitis in 80, blunt scrotal trauma in 15, a bulky epididymal cyst or a hydrocele in 4, and testicular pain of unknown etiology in the remaining 6 cases. Standard ultrasound was pathological.
