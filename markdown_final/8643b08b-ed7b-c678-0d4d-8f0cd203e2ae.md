## Question

Prevalence and incidence of parkinson in the United States

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the prevalence and incidence of Parkinson's disease in the United States. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative, recent sources for U.S. prevalence and incidence. Then, I should verify age- and sex-specific estimates and reconcile any discrepancies. Next, I will examine temporal trends and projections. After that, I need to check geographic and racial/ethnic variations. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically useful summary with caveats and limitations, making sure I cite only figures that appear in the references.

> Let me first confirm the highest-quality prevalence estimates. The Parkinson's Foundation–coordinated P4 Project meta-analysis, using multiple North American datasets and standardized to the 2010 U.S. population, estimated a prevalence of 572 per 100,000 among adults aged 45 years and older, corresponding to approximately 680,000 cases in 2010, with projections to 930,000 in 2020 and 1,238,000 in 2030, assuming stable age-specific prevalence and using U.S. Census projections [^098711a9] [^96af6107]. Wait, let me verify the most recent U.S. estimate; an economic burden analysis using Medicare and other data estimated about 1 million people with diagnosed PD in the U.S. in 2017, which aligns with the trajectory from P4 and supports the notion that current U.S. prevalence is roughly 1 million, acknowledging that estimates depend on case ascertainment and diagnostic criteria [^592a9f97].

> I need to check incidence next. The North American incidence study pooling five large cohorts and administrative datasets reported age–sex-adjusted incidence of 47–77 per 100,000 person-years among adults 45 and older, and 108–212 per 100,000 person-years among adults 65 and older, with higher rates in men and a male-to-female ratio around 1.5–2.0 in older age groups; the authors propose a working estimate of 62 per 100,000 person-years for ages 45 and older, translating to roughly 77,000–86,000 new cases per year depending on the reference year and population structure [^5c38c30a] [^ed711ffd] [^6ff67d80]. Hold on, I should verify the older, commonly cited U.S. incidence figure of about 9–10 per 100,000; that lower estimate reflects all-age incidence and outdated ascertainment, so the newer, age-restricted figures are more appropriate for contemporary planning and risk assessment [^006cc62a].

> Let me consider age and sex patterns carefully. Prevalence and incidence rise exponentially with age, and the male predominance becomes more pronounced in older age strata; for example, in pooled analyses, the male-to-female incidence ratio increases from about 1.46 in ages 60–79 to 1.93 in those over 80, consistent with a biological sex effect superimposed on age-related risk accumulation [^26b8810d]. I should double-check that this pattern is consistent across datasets; yes, Medicare-based and cohort-based analyses both show higher incidence in men and a steeper age gradient in men, supporting the robustness of this finding [^6ff67d80] [^87699af7].

> Next, I should review temporal trends and projections. Prevalence is rising faster than expected from aging alone, with age-standardized prevalence increasing globally and in North America, implying changes in incidence, survival, or case ascertainment; the P4 projections to 2030 already show a near-doubling from 2010, and more recent modeling suggests the U.S. could reach approximately 1.2–1.3 million cases by 2030, with the economic burden exceeding $79 billion by 2037 if current trends continue [^098711a9] [^592a9f97]. Wait, let me verify whether incidence itself is increasing; the Rochester Epidemiology Project found a significant increase in PD incidence over 30 years, particularly in men 70 and older, suggesting real secular changes in addition to improved detection [^ba2a5da7].

> I will now examine geographic and racial/ethnic variations. There is marked regional heterogeneity within the U.S., with higher prevalence and incidence in parts of the Midwest, Northeast, and certain agricultural regions, and lower rates in some Western and Hawaiian populations; these patterns persist across datasets and may reflect environmental exposures, healthcare access, or diagnostic practices [^fe59b063] [^c5741579]. Hold on, I should verify racial disparities; multiple analyses show substantially lower diagnosed prevalence and incidence among Black Americans compared with White Americans, even after adjusting for access and utilization, indicating underdiagnosis and possibly biological differences, with cumulative incidence estimates around 23 per 100,000 in Black individuals versus 54 per 100,000 in White individuals over four years [^7037ce85] [^0f51b07b]. But wait, what if ascertainment differs by region and race? Indeed, Medicare-based studies and state-level analyses corroborate lower recorded prevalence in Black beneficiaries and highlight the need to address diagnostic equity and surveillance methods [^fe59b063] [^771d47a4].

> Let me synthesize and make sure the numbers are internally consistent. For prevalence, the best-supported U.S. estimate is about 1 million people with diagnosed PD currently, rising to roughly 1.2–1.3 million by 2030, with an age-standardized prevalence near 572 per 100,000 in adults 45 and older; for incidence, the most defensible figure is about 62 per 100,000 person-years in adults 45 and older, corresponding to approximately 77,000–86,000 new cases annually, with higher rates in those 65 and older and in men [^098711a9] [^592a9f97] [^ed711ffd]. I should confirm that these figures align with global burden estimates; yes, GBD analyses place North America among the highest-prevalence regions, consistent with these U.S.-specific estimates and the observed age and sex gradients [^d8a1d023].

> Finally, I need to ensure the limitations are explicit. Estimates vary with case definitions, data sources, and ascertainment; administrative data tend to capture treated, diagnosed cases and may over- or under-estimate depending on coding and access, while cohort studies are smaller but more standardized; geographic and racial heterogeneity, along with evolving diagnostic practices, complicate comparisons over time and across regions, so ranges and sensitivity analyses should be emphasized in planning and research design [^3fe00824] [^fe59b063] [^c693fcc7]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality for trends; while incidence appears to be rising in some populations, changes in recognition, survival, and environmental exposures likely contribute, and ongoing surveillance with harmonized criteria is needed to disentangle these drivers [^1a3097b3] [^ba2a5da7].

### Incidence of parkinson disease in north America [^5c38c30a]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common age-related neurodegenerative condition diagnosed in North America. We recently demonstrated, using multiple epidemiological data sources, that the prevalence of PD diagnoses was greater than previously reported and currently used for clinical, research, and policy decision-making. Prior PD incidence estimates have varied, for unclear reasons. There is a need for improved estimates of PD incidence, not only for care delivery planning and future policy but also for increasing our understanding of disease risk. The objective of this study was thus to investigate the incidence of Parkinson disease across five epidemiological cohorts in North America in a common year, 2012. The cohorts contained data on 6.7 million person-years of adults ages 45 and older, and 9.3 million person-years of adults ages 65 and older. Our estimates of age-sex-adjusted incidence of PD ranged from 108 to 212 per 100,000 among persons ages 65 and older, and from 47 to 77 per 100,00 among persons ages 45 and older. PD incidence increased with age and was higher among males. We also found persistent spatial clustering of incident PD diagnoses in the U.S. PD incidence estimates varied across our data sources, in part due to case ascertainment and diagnosis methods, but also possibly due to the influence of population factors (prevalence of genetic risk factors or protective markers) and geographic location (exposure to environmental toxins). Understanding the source of these variations will be important for health care policy, research, and care planning.

### The current and projected economic burden of Parkinson's disease in the United States [^dc3ea012]. Movement Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Parkinson's disease (PD), following Alzheimer's disease, is the second-most common neurodegenerative disorder in the United States. A lack of treatment options for changing the trajectory of disease progression, in combination with an increasing elderly population, portends a rising economic burden on patients and payers. This study combined information from nationally representative surveys to create a burden of PD model. The model estimates disease prevalence, excess healthcare use and medical costs, and nonmedical costs for each demographic group defined by age and sex. Estimated prevalence rates and costs were applied to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2010 to 2050 population data to estimate current and projected burden based on changing demographics. We estimate that approximately 630,000 people in the United States had diagnosed PD in 2010, with diagnosed prevalence likely to double by 2040. The national economic burden of PD exceeds $14.4 billion in 2010 (approximately $22,800 per patient). The population with PD incurred medical expenses of approximately $14 billion in 2010, $8.1 billion higher ($12,800 per capita) than expected for a similar population without PD. Indirect costs (e.g., reduced employment) are conservatively estimated at $6.3 billion (or close to $10,000 per person with PD). The burden of chronic conditions such as PD is projected to grow substantially over the next few decades as the size of the elderly population grows. Such projections give impetus to the need for innovative new treatments to prevent, delay onset, or alleviate symptoms of PD and other similar diseases.

Introduction

Parkinson disease is a multi-system and multi-symptomatic neurodegenerative disorder, for which modifying or preventative measures are not presently available. As the population in Western nations has shifted to include a greater proportion of older adults, the public health and economic burdens of age-associated neurodegenerative disease have increased with an estimated economic cost of $52B per year in the US alone. Indeed, the single greatest risk factor for PD is advanced age.

Disease frequency in a given population can be measured as the annual prevalence (proportion of persons currently diagnosed with the disease) or incidence (proportion of persons newly diagnosed with the disease). Recently, we performed meta estimates of the 2010 prevalence of PD in North America, using multinational data from current and past epidemiology projects. Our primary finding was that the overall prevalence of Parkinson disease among persons ages 45 and older was 572/100,000. We also found that PD burden in the population at ages 65 and above was higher than typically reported. These improved prevalence estimates and economic burden projections are but some of the vital statistics for population health. Prevalence is influenced not only by new cases appearing in the population but also by the survival of established cases. Incidence is an important complementary statistic in that it is a more direct reflection of the impact of risk factors for a disease (in the absence of changes in diagnostic efficiency). Improved estimates of disease incidence and mortality are also necessary for understanding disease risk, planning healthcare capacity, delivery, anticipating and addressing care disparities, and identifying unwarranted variations in care delivery.

Prior work has described the incidence of PD in limited populations such as isolated groups, cities, or lower population countries –. However, PD incidence data that are multinational or derived from multiple sources are not well documented. Health care systems, clinical registries, and clinical cohorts have the capability to detect and report PD burden. Although each data source contains varying degrees of patient representativeness, sensitivity, and specificity, the heterogeneity of the data underscores the need for disease burden estimates to include data from multiple patient sources. Therefore, building upon our efforts for improved estimates of PD prevalence, our group examined PD incidence across multiple regional cohorts and national datasets to generate an improved estimate of the incidence of Parkinson disease among older adults in North America. By aggregation of the available data, age and sex-stratified PD incidence estimates were derived. Additionally, the spatial clustering of Parkinson disease risk was explored.

### Epidemiology of Parkinson's disease [^36455b43]. Journal of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Epidemiological research aims to provide information on the development, prevalence and progression of diseases, and their associated risk factors. Epidemiological research is thus the basis of increasing our understanding on the aetiology of diseases and as a consequence the starting point for identifying at risk groups in the population, development for novel prevention and treatment strategies, and health care planning. This review provides an overview of the epidemiology of Parkinson's disease, the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, with special emphasis on population-based data on the clinical progression of motor and non-motor features of the disease.

### Current and projected future economic burden of Parkinson's disease in the U.S [^592a9f97]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the world's fastest growing neurological disorders. Much is unknown about PD-associated economic burdens in the United States (U.S.) and other high-income nations. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the economic burdens of PD in the U.S. (2017) and projections for the next two decades. Multiple data sources were used to estimate the costs of PD, including public and private administrative claims data, Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, and a primary survey (n = 4,548) designed for this study. We estimated a U.S. prevalence of approximately one million individuals with diagnosed Parkinson's disease in 2017 and a total economic burden of $51.9 billion. The total burden of PD includes direct medical costs of $25.4 billion and $26.5 billion in indirect and non-medical costs, including an indirect cost of $14.2 billion (PWP and caregiver burden combined), non-medical costs of $7.5 billion, and $4.8 billion due to disability income received by PWPs. The Medicare program bears the largest share of excess medical costs, as most PD patients are over age 65. Projected PD prevalence will be more than 1.6 million with projected total economic burden surpassing $79 billion by 2037. The economic burden of PD was previously underestimated. Our findings underscore the substantial burden of PD to society, payers, patients, and caregivers. Interventions to reduce PD incidence, delay disease progression, and alleviate symptom burden may reduce the future economic burden of PD.

### Prevalence of Parkinson's disease across north America [^79ee474e]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Commonly, medical records or health system claims data are used to estimate PD prevalence. The limitations of this approach with respect to diagnostic misclassification notwithstanding, an advantage of such studies is their size, often using data on millions of individuals to deliver more precise estimates than can be produced by studies that contact people directly. North American estimates of PD prevalence from such studies have varied widely and have noted geographical variation. –

Beginning in 2014, the Parkinson's Foundation established the Parkinson's Foundation Parkinson's Prevalence Project (P4) to coordinate epidemiological investigations of prevalence conducted at disparate sites throughout North America. The P4 Project combines data from five different recent or current projects covering four different regions across North America and compares these to prevalence estimates generated using nationwide data from the US to provide an updated and more precise estimate of PD burden. Specifically, we aimed to address the following questions:
Is the prevalence of PD uniform throughout North America or does it vary by study and/or geography?
To the extent that these data can be considered consistent, what meta-estimates of prevalence do they provide?

Introduction

Prevalence estimates of disease are important for public health planning. The upcoming demographic shifts toward older individuals in western nations have led to major efforts to project the health-care burden over the coming decades, particularly for diseases for which incidence rises considerably with age, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (PD). The projected increases in dementia have been referred to as a "Rising tide", emphasizing the sheer volume of this problem and warnings of the public health challenges of caring for these individuals have been issued.PD presents similar challenges as its prevalence in the world's most populous nations has been projected to more than double between 2005 and 2030. These estimates do not account for changes in exposures that may further contribute to increased incidence or prevalence.

A recent systematic review and meta-analysis examined the prevalence of PD worldwide as estimated by studies performed since 1985. Included in the review were studies that used door-to-door ascertainment or random population sampling followed by physical examination. Point estimates of age-specific prevalence across regions varied widely, and confidence intervals were broad, limiting the interpretability of these data for public health planning. Furthermore, only two such studies were identified in North America since 1985, both in Canada identifying 2 and 4 PD cases each. An earlier study of PD prevalence in Copiah County, Mississippi, USA conducted in 1978 is commonly used as the estimate of prevalence for PD in the US, although its calculations were based on only 26 cases of idiopathic PD ascertained from a small area. More recent estimates based on more robust data from a wider sampling frame are needed.

### Current and projected future economic burden of Parkinson's disease in the U.S [^fd373296]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Future projections

We projected the future prevalence of PD by applying the estimated age- and gender-specific PD prevalence rate in 2017 to U.S. Census population projections for years 2018–2037. The projected PD prevalence based on this approach factored in population growth and demographic changes in population and assumed that current PD incidence and mortality rates remain constant during this period. Combining the projected future PD prevalence with the estimated 2017 per PWP burden by cost component, we also projected the future overall impact of PD through year 2037. We did not account for inflation, any potential changes in healthcare utilization or price changes due to changes in treatment intensity, etc. Neither did we apply a discount rate as these estimates represent the projected future burden in real 2017 dollars.

### The epidemiology of Parkinson's disease [^1a3097b3]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

The epidemiology of Parkinson's disease shows marked variations in time, geography, ethnicity, age, and sex. Internationally, prevalence has increased over and above demographic changes. There are several potential reasons for this increase, including the decline in other competing causes of death. Whether incidence is increasing, especially in women or in many low-income and middle-income countries where there is a shortage of high-quality data, is less certain. Parkinson's disease is more common in older people and men, and a variety of environmental factors have been suggested to explain why, including exposure to neurotoxic agents. Within countries, there appear to be ethnic differences in disease risk, although these differences might reflect differential access to health care. The cause of Parkinson's disease is multifactorial, and involves genetic and environmental factors. Both risk factors (eg, pesticides) and protective factors (eg, physical activity and tendency to smoke) have been postulated to have a role in Parkinson's disease, although elucidating causality is complicated by the long prodromal period. Following the establishment of public health strategies to prevent cardiovascular diseases and some cancers, chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and dementia are gaining a deserved higher priority. Multipronged prevention strategies are required that tackle population-based primary prevention, high-risk targeted secondary prevention, and Parkinson's disease-modifying therapies for tertiary prevention. Future international collaborations will be required to triangulate evidence from basic, applied, and epidemiological research, thereby enhancing the understanding and prevention of Parkinson's disease at a global level.

### Does black vs. white race affect practitioners' appraisal of Parkinson's disease? [^7037ce85]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that leads to reduced quality of life, severe disability, and societal cost. Parkinson's disease affects approximately 1 million people in the United States (US), and that number is projected to double in the next 25 years. There is a large racial disparity in the prevalence and incidence of PD in Black and White people –. "Black" is typically defined as a person having origins in any of the Black racial groups of Africa, whereas "White" is typically defined as a person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa. For example, the prevalence of PD is 50% lower in Black individuals as compared to White individuals, where Black people are half as likely as White people to receive a diagnosis of this disease. In the US, the 4-year cumulative incidence of PD has been estimated at 54 per 100,000 among White individuals compared to 23 per 100,000 among Black individuals.

### Prevalence of Parkinson's disease across north America [^098711a9]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Estimates of the prevalence of Parkinson's disease in North America have varied widely and many estimates are based on small numbers of cases and from small regional subpopulations. We sought to estimate the prevalence of Parkinson's disease in North America by combining data from a multi-study sampling strategy in diverse geographic regions and/or data sources. Five separate cohort studies in California (2), Minnesota (1), Hawaii USA (1), and Ontario, Canada (1) estimated the prevalence of PD from health-care records (3), active ascertainment through facilities, large group, and neurology practices (1), and longitudinal follow-up of a population cohort (1). US Medicare program data provided complementary estimates for the corresponding regions. Using our age- and sex-specific meta-estimates from California, Minnesota, and Ontario and the US population structure from 2010, we estimate the overall prevalence of PD among those aged ≥ 45 years to be 572 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval 537–614) that there were 680,000 individuals in the US aged ≥ 45 years with PD in 2010 and that that number will rise to approximately 930,000 in 2020 and 1,238,000 in 2030 based on the US Census Bureau population projections. Regional variations in prevalence were also observed in both the project results and the Medicare-based calculations with which they were compared. The estimates generated by the Hawaiian study were lower across age categories. These estimates can guide health-care planning but should be considered minimum estimates. Some heterogeneity exists that remains to be understood.

### Epidemiology of Parkinson's disease [^6289e903]. The Lancet: Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

The causes of Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, are still largely unknown. Current thinking is that major gene mutations cause only a small proportion of all cases and that in most cases, non-genetic factors play a part, probably in interaction with susceptibility genes. Numerous epidemiological studies have been done to identify such non-genetic risk factors, but most were small and methodologically limited. Larger, well-designed prospective cohort studies have only recently reached a stage at which they have enough incident patients and person-years of follow-up to investigate possible risk factors and their interactions. In this article, we review what is known about the prevalence, incidence, risk factors, and prognosis of PD from epidemiological studies.

### Projections for prevalence of Parkinson's disease and its driving factors in 195 countries and territories to 2050: modelling study of global burden of disease study 2021 [^5ea31aa1]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the world. The World Health Organization has estimated that neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease will become the second leading cause of death worldwide by 2040, surpassing cancer related deaths. According to the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015, Parkinson's disease is the neurological disease with the fastest growing prevalence and disability. The significance of a comprehensive forecast of future prevalence of Parkinson's disease is underscored by the substantial increasing trends in the disease burden of Parkinson's disease, as it plays a crucial role in gaining insights into future epidemic patterns, facilitating proactive management, enabling informed policy decisions, and guiding public health interventions. To date, only one study has projected the future global number of patients with Parkinson's disease to 2040 on the basis of Global Burden of Disease 2015 and a 2014 meta-analysis, without projections for the global prevalence of Parkinson's disease. Although other investigations have focused on forecasting the future prevalence of Parkinson's disease in the US and France, as well as the future number of people with Parkinson's disease in Europe, the US, Canada, China, and France, predictions of Parkinson's disease prevalence in most other countries and territories are still lacking. Previous investigations found great variations in prevalence estimates for Parkinson's disease across regions, age groups, sexes, and years, emphasising the complex nature of predicting future prevalence both temporally and spatially. Therefore, to effectively target prevention and intervention, a comprehensive forecast and quantitative analysis of the future prevalence of Parkinson's disease at global, regional, and national levels by socioeconomic status, age, and sex is needed.

### Global, regional, and national burden of Parkinson's disease, 1990–2016: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2016 [^0cdd43f8]. The Lancet: Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Neurological disorders are now the leading source of disability in the world, and Parkinson's disease is the fastest growing of these disorders. As the population ages and life expectancy increases, the doubling of the number of individuals with Parkinson's disease between 1990 and 2016 is projected to occur again in the coming generation. To address this great health challenge will require action aimed at preventing the disease where feasible and improving the lives of those affected by the condition. Among the potential responses available are preventing the disease (eg, by increasing physical activity earlier in adulthoodand reducing exposure to pesticides), improving worldwide access to care and effective treatments (eg, levodopa), increasing funding for research (eg, to understand the underlying causes), and development of new therapies.

### Temporal trends in the prevalence of Parkinson's disease from 1980 to 2023: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^bb35d4e6]. The Lancet: Healthy Longevity (2024). High credibility.

Background

Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, exhibiting an upward trend in prevalence. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of Parkinson's disease, temporal trends between 1980 and 2023, and variations in prevalence by location, age, sex, survey period, sociodemographic index (SDI), human development index (HDI), and study characteristics (sample size, diagnostic criteria, and data source).

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis we searched PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, and Global Health for observational studies that reported Parkinson's disease prevalence in the general population from database inception to Nov 1, 2023. We included studies if they were original observational investigations, had participants from the general population or community-based datasets, and provided numerical data on the prevalence of Parkinson's disease either with 95% CIs or with sufficient information to calculate 95% CIs. Studies were excluded if they were conducted in a specific population, had a sample size smaller than 1000, or were review articles, case reports, protocols, meeting abstracts, letters, comments, short communications, posters, and reports. The publication characteristics (first author and publication year), study location (countries, WHO regions, SDI, and HDI), survey period, study design, diagnostic criteria, data source, participant information, and prevalence data were extracted from articles using a standard form. Two authors independently evaluated eligibility, and discrepancies were resolved through discussion with the third author. We used random effect models to pool estimates with 95% CIs. Estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was calculated to assess the temporal trend in prevalence of Parkinson's disease. The study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42022364417.

Findings

83 studies from 37 countries were eligible for analysis, with 56 studies providing all-age prevalence, 53 studies reporting age-specific prevalence, and 26 studies providing both all-age and age-specific prevalence. Global pooled prevalence of Parkinson's disease was 1·51 cases per 1000 (95% CI 1·19–1·88), which was higher in males (1·54 cases per 1000 [1·17–1·96]) than in females (1·49 cases per 1000 [1·12–1·92], p = 0·030). During different survey periods, the prevalence of Parkinson's disease was 0·90 cases per 1000 (0·48–1·44; 1980–89), 1·38 cases per 1000 (1·17–1·61; 1990–99), 1·18 cases per 1000 (0·77–1·67; 2000–09), and 3·81 cases per 1000 (2·67–5·14; 2010–23). The EAPC of Parkinson's disease prevalence was significantly higher in the period of 2004–23 (EAPC 16·32% [95% CI 6·07–26·58], p = 0·0040) than in the period of 1980–2003 (5·30% [0·82–9·79], p = 0·022). Statistically significant disparities in prevalence were observed across six WHO regions. Prevalence increased with HDI or SDI. Considerable variations were observed in the pooled prevalence of Parkinson's disease based on different sample sizes or diagnostic criteria. Prevalence also increased with age, reaching 9·34 cases per 1000 (7·26–11·67) among individuals older than 60 years.

Interpretation

The global prevalence of Parkinson's disease has been increasing since the 1980s, with a more pronounced rise in the past two decades. The prevalence of Parkinson's disease is higher in countries with higher HDI or SDI. It is necessary to conduct more high-quality epidemiological studies on Parkinson's disease, especially in low SDI countries.

### Projection of the prevalence of Parkinson's disease in the coming decades: revisited [^28c9f0b2]. Movement Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Previous studies have estimated future PD prevalence based on population aging. This study revisits that projection by accounting for the potential impact of declining rates of smoking.

Methods

The age- and gender-stratified smoking prevalence in the United States from 2000 to 2040 were obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Surgeon General's Smoking Report. PD prevalence was estimated based on population aging with and without an account of the impact of declining smoking rates. Relative risks of 0.56 and 0.78 were applied for current and former smokers, respectively.

Results

Accounting for aging alone, ∼700,000 PD cases are predicted by 2040. After accounting for the declining smoking prevalence, ∼770,000 cases, an increase of ∼10% over the estimate without smoking, is predicted.

Conclusions

If the epidemiological association of smoking and PD is causal, projecting future cases without considering smoking may underestimate disease burden, underscoring the urgency of adequate resource allocation. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Global, regional, and national burden of Parkinson's disease, 1990–2016: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2016 [^c693fcc7]. The Lancet: Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

This study confirms that Parkinson's disease is about 1·4 times more frequent in men than women, and this ratio did not change substantially over the study period. Environmental (eg, occupational) exposures to which men are more frequently exposed might contribute to this pattern. The prevalence of Parkinson's disease increased with age. Underascertainment at older ages owing to underdiagnosis, comorbidities, or institutional care might explain the decrease seen in the oldest age groups after the peak between 85 years and 89 years.

The current estimates for the global burden of Parkinson's disease are generated from imperfect data and models that are refined in each iteration of the GBD study. Estimates from GBD studies can vary from year to year as revised estimates are generated on the basis of refined methods and inclusion of more and higher-quality studies that are less likely to underestimate the true burden of the disease. Nonetheless, high-quality epidemiological studies (especially on incidence and disease severity) are still rare for large portions of the world, especially in low-income regions, where such studies are needed to understand trends and guide efforts to reduce the disease burden. Methodological differences for determining prevalence and study shortcomings might result in estimates that vary considerably and underestimate the true burden of Parkinson's disease. This under-reporting is well known for Parkinson's disease in studies based on death certificates, whereas population-based door-to-door studies are considered a better approach because they are able to capture undiagnosed cases. However, disease frequency estimates from population-based studies might be affected by selection bias resulting from non-response, particularly if individuals affected by the disease under investigation are less likely to participate. Non-response is an important issue as participation rates in epidemiological studies have considerably decreased over the past 30 years. Another limitation is that because we lack strong predictors for the occurrence of Parkinson's disease, some of the variation between countries is probably due to measurement error that we have been unable to correct. Because we rely on prevalence data to derive our cause of death estimates, any residual measurement error in the prevalence estimates is transposed onto the death estimates for Parkinson's disease. Although the the bias in mortality is an unwanted property, it is less than would have been the case if we had based our estimates on the observed rates of death with Parkinson's disease as the underlying cause from vital registration data. The large variation in death rates over time within the same countries and the even larger variation between countries are implausible and probably explained by changing death coding practices.

### Global, regional, and national burden of Parkinson's disease, 1990–2016: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2016 [^b1483999]. The Lancet: Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Fourth, declining smoking rates in some countries, although a global health boon, might contribute to higher incidence of Parkinson's disease. The risk of Parkinson's disease is decreased by approximately 40% among smokers. Whether this association is truly causal or explained by reverse causation or other biases is still debated. If the association between smoking and Parkinson's disease were causal, decreasing smoking rates would lead to an increase in the incidence of Parkinson's disease in the future. Assuming a causal inverse association and a 10-year lag to account for the temporal effect of smoking on the incidence of Parkinson's disease, one study in the USAestimated that declining smoking rates in the country might increase the projected burden of Parkinson's disease in 2040 by 10%. However, because the lag time between exposure and the actual effect on disease risk is unknown and might actually be longer than 10 years, the timing of the potential effect of declining smoking rates on Parkinson's disease incidence is uncertain, and additional studies are needed to examine the effects of changing smoking habits in different parts of the world with different smoking rates and time trends. Regardless of the results of such studies, the adverse health consequences of smoking far outweigh any potential benefit on Parkinson's disease. Finally, changes in the prevalence of other known (eg, head trauma) or unknown risk or protective factors that were not included in GBD 2016 might contribute to changing incidence rates of Parkinson's disease.

### Projected number of people with parkinson disease in the most populous nations, 2005 through 2030 [^c1b406a6]. Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Based on published prevalence studies, we used two different methodologies to project the number of individuals with Parkinson disease (PD) in Western Europe's 5 most and the world's 10 most populous nations. The number of individuals with PD over age 50 in these countries was between 4.1 and 4.6 million in 2005 and will double to between 8.7 and 9.3 million by 2030.

### Global, regional, and national burden of Parkinson's disease, 1990–2016: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2016 [^40ce4f2e]. The Lancet: Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Added value of this study

We used the results of this search to obtain the data needed to estimate global, regional, and country-specific prevalence and years lived with disability for Parkinson's disease from 1990 to 2016. To address the possible measurement error in Parkinson's disease death rates as reported by vital registration systems, we used a method that was previously applied to dementia in GBD 2015. In a natural history modelling approach, we assume a constant risk of death in Parkinson's disease cases over time and between locations and let the death rates be determined by variations in prevalence. Although the assumption of similar mortality risk in all time periods and countries is problematic, it produces less error than the large variation in death rates estimated previously. We also explored variation in the burden by age, sex, country, region, and Socio-demographic Index. This study showed that counts of prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years more than doubled from 1990 to 2016, and that this increase was not solely due to increasing numbers of older people because age-standardised rates also increased in most regions. In addition, the burden of Parkinson's disease increased with increasing Socio-demographic Index.

Implications of all the available evidence

Neurological disorders are now the leading source of disability in the world, and Parkinson's disease is the fastest growing of these disorders. As the population ages and life expectancy increases, the number of individuals with Parkinson's disease will continue to increase as well as the duration of the disease, leading to more patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. To address this burden, primary prevention strategies based on the underlying causes of Parkinson's disease and more effective treatments than are currently available are required. Additional incidence and prevalence studies are needed, especially in areas in which little data are available, to examine time trends and the factors that drive them.

As part of GBD 2016, we aimed to examine the changes from 1990 to 2016 in counts and age-standardised rates of Parkinson's disease for prevalence, disability, and deaths by location and by the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite measure of income per capita, education, and fertility.

### Prevalence and incidence of Parkinson's disease in latin America: a meta-analysis [^9838d3a8]. Movement Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a rapidly growing neurodegenerative disorder, but up-to-date epidemiological data are lacking in Latin America. We sought to estimate the prevalence and incidence of PD and parkinsonism in Latin America.

Methods

We searched Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Scientific Electronic Library Online, and Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde or the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Literature databases for epidemiological studies reporting the prevalence or incidence of PD or parkinsonism in Latin America from their inception to 2022. Quality of studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist. Data were pooled via random-effects meta-analysis and analyzed by data source (cohort studies or administrative databases), sex, and age group. Significant differences between groups were determined by meta-regression.

Results

Eighteen studies from 13 Latin American countries were included in the review. Meta-analyses of 17 studies (nearly 4million participants) found a prevalence of 472 (95% CI, 271–820) per 100,000 and three studies an incidence of 31 (95% CI, 23–40) per 100,000 person-years for PD; and seven studies found a prevalence of 4300 (95% CI, 1863–9613) per 100,000 for parkinsonism. The prevalence of PD differed by data source (cohort studies, 733 [95% CI, 427–1255] vs. administrative databases. 114 [95% CI, 63–209] per 100,000, P < 0.01), age group (P < 0.01), but not sex (P = 0.73). PD prevalence in ≥ 60years also differed significantly by data source (cohort studies. 1229 [95% CI, 741–2032] vs. administrative databases, 593 [95% CI, 480–733] per 100,000, P < 0.01). Similar patterns were observed for parkinsonism.

Conclusions

The overall prevalence and incidence of PD in Latin America were estimated. PD prevalence differed significantly by the data source and age, but not sex. © 2023 The Authors. Movement Disorders published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Projections for prevalence of Parkinson's disease and its driving factors in 195 countries and territories to 2050: modelling study of global burden of disease study 2021 [^70a6afbb]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with previous studies

Our projection for the global number of Parkinson's disease cases in 2040 considerably surpasses the previous estimates by Dorsey and colleagues, which relied on worldwide prevalence data from a meta-analysis conducted in 2014 and Global Burden of Disease 2015, along with population forecasts from the US Census Bureau. Not only did we forecast the global trends in the prevalence and number of cases of Parkinson's disease, but we also estimated the future prevalence and number of cases across 195 countries and territories, as well as 21 Global Burden of Disease regions, stratified by Socio-demographic Index, sex, and age group. At the national level, we anticipated the predicted future prevalence of Parkinson's disease in the US and France to be higher than previous forecasts by 12% and 7%, respectively. Meanwhile, our forecasts for future number of Parkinson's disease patients in France, the US, and China were approximately 10%, 10%, and 40%, higher than previous estimates, respectively, although our prediction for Canada was 18% lower. The significant disparities may stem from discrepancies in data sources, temporal intervals, forecasting frameworks, and methods. The prevalence data and population data for our forecasts came from Global Burden of Disease 2021 and 2017, respectively, which have been widely used in prevalence prediction. Compared with Global Burden of Disease 2015 and other sources used in previous forecasting, Global Burden of Disease 2021 has been enhanced with additional data and refined analytical methods, owing to the contributions of a global network of collaborators. Globally, the prevalence of Parkinson's disease in 2021 estimated by Global Burden of Disease 2021 (149 cases per 100 000) closely matched the results of a recent meta-analysis (151 cases per 100 000). The prevalence of Parkinson's disease estimated by Global Burden of Disease 2021 in China and Italy aligns with findings from epidemiological studies. In terms of prediction models, one previous study used a multi-state model that accounted for incidence and mortality to forecast the prevalence of Parkinson's disease. However, it overlooked important risk factors such as ageing and socioeconomic status. Another projection assumed that the future prevalence of Parkinson's disease across all age groups would remain constant with that of past periods, disregarding the variation in age specific prevalence. In contrast to previous forecasts, the prediction model in our study has been optimised through various approaches. We chose the Poisson regression model for projection because it is suitable for analysing events with low probabilities. Then, we incorporated the key factors that contribute to changes in the prevalence of Parkinson's disease, as identified by large scale epidemiological studies and meta-analyses, into this model. For trends not explained by the above covariates, we integrated them into forecasts by using the ARIMA method. Moreover, to account for the uncertainty of a single model in previous projections, we used a probabilistic bayesian model averaging approach to estimate the future prevalence of Parkinson's disease by using an ensemble of models. The time frame for prediction was also extended to 2050. The validation showed the high accuracy of our predictions by comparing our forecasted prevalence of the period of 2011–21 with the Global Burden of Disease 2021 prevalence results. Considering that the data for our forecast primarily originate from Global Burden of Disease 2021, the incorporated predictors are systematic, and the prediction model is optimised, our projections for future prevalence and number of Parkinson's disease patients should be more comprehensive and accurate than previously reported estimates.

Introduction

Neurological disorders are now the leading source of disability globally. Among neurological disorders examined in the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2015, Parkinson's disease was the fastest growing in prevalence, disability, and deaths. In that study, the overall number of people affected by the disease was estimated to have more than doubled globally from 1990 to 2015. Previous studies have examined the epidemiology of Parkinson's disease for different parts of the world, including systematic reviews on the prevalence of Parkinson's disease. However, none has examined change in prevalence, disability, and deaths in detail over the past generation for the entire world and across all countries. In GBD 2015, we identified larger variation in Parkinson's disease death rate estimates over time and between countries than we observed in prevalence estimates. This pattern suggested that coding practices rather than real changes over time and location were responsible, similar to what was observed for dementia.

The prevalence of a disease reflects both the incidence and the duration of disease. The incidence of Parkinson's disease is linked to risk and protective factors. The most important risk factor is age, but the risk of Parkinson's disease also appears to be associated with industrial chemicals and pollutants, such as pesticides, solvents, and metals. Conversely, smoking is associated with a decreased risk of Parkinson's disease, but whether this association is causal is debatable. The factors that affect disease duration are less well known, but increasing longevity also translates into longer disease duration. Therefore, as ageing and industrialisation increase globally and smoking decreases in some regions, the prevalence of Parkinson's disease seems poised to increase. Detailed estimates of the disease burden can help to evaluate the effect of these risk factors and inform efforts to prevent the disease and to care for and treat those affected by the condition.

### Parkinson disease with and without dementia: a prevalence study and future projections [^f455e098]. Movement Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Limited population-based information is available on the co-occurrence of dementia and PD. However, projecting the prevalence of PD with and without dementia during the next 50 years is crucial for planning public-health and patient-care initiatives.

Objectives

The objective of this study was to project the prevalence of PD with and without dementia in the United States by 2060.

Methods

We used the Rochester Epidemiology Project medical records-linkage system to identify all persons with PD with or without dementia residing in Olmsted County, Minnesota, on January 1, 2006. A movement disorders specialist reviewed the complete medical records of each person to confirm the presence of PD. We calculated the age- and sex-specific prevalence of PD with and without dementia and projected U.S. prevalence through 2060.

Results

We identified 296 persons with PD with and without dementia on the prevalence date (187 men, 109 women); the overall prevalence increased with age from 0.01% (30–39 years) to 2.83% (≥ 90 years). The prevalence of PD without dementia increased with age from 0.01% (30–39 years) to 1.25% (≥ 90 years). The prevalence of PD with dementia increased with age from 0.10% (60–69 years) to 1.59% (≥ 90 years). The prevalence was higher in men than in women for all subtypes and all age groups. We project by 2060 an approximate doubling of the number of persons with PD without dementia and a tripling of the number of persons with PD with dementia in the United States.

Conclusions

The prevalence of PD with and without dementia increases with age and is higher in men than women. We project that the number of persons with PD in the United States will increase substantially by 2060. © 2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Incidence of parkinson disease in north America [^ed711ffd]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Because of the significant implications for health care policy, research, and care planning, we propose a working estimate of a PD incident rate of 62 per 100,000 person-years for those 45 and older. For 2012 population data, this rate would equate to 77,000 diagnosed PD cases per annum; for 2020, the number of diagnosed PD cases rises to 86,000 per annum assuming negligible changes in age distribution from our standardization year (2010). The growth in those diagnosed and living with PD underscores the need for policy makers to confront an increasing strain on clinical services – as well as the need to provide additional funding for research that can lead to improved therapies if not an outright cure.

Our study, like all retrospective studies, has several limitations. It is prone to measurement error that can be due to confounding, misclassification, miscoding and selection bias, among others. Our estimates were primarily derived using data from completed epidemiological studies, limiting our ability to apply new or varying diagnostic and ascertainment criteria across datasets. PD incidence rates for the current year may be even higher due to decreased prevalence of alleged protective factors (e.g. smoking), increased prevalence of risk markers(e.g. diabetes, cognitive dysfunction, lack of physical activity, pesticides), or greater clinical recognition of PD symptoms, particularly among older adults with comorbidities. In contrast, PD incidence trends from 2012 to now may be negatively affected by reduced community and occupational exposure to environmental toxicantsor lower case ascertainment due to COVID-related changes in health care-seeking behavior.

Our study highlights the need for more work throughout the translational epidemiology continuum and the potential benefits of harmonizing case ascertainment and diagnostic criteria across data sources. Obtaining high-quality incidence rates in multiple populations is fundamental to understanding what is needed to address the burden of the disease and to plan for adequate healthcare services. Although population-based PD registries would be ideal and have been tried in some areas –, setting up and maintaining a disease registry has proven to to be logistically difficult and expensive. Alternative approaches and data sources, such as those included here, can provide high-quality estimates for both the prevalence and incidence of disorders such as Parkinson's disease.

### An update on the diagnosis and treatment of parkinson disease [^01d0cdb4]. CMAJ (2016). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Parkinson's disease:

- **Definition**: PD is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor, cognitive and autonomic dysfunction, as well as mood and impulse control disorders.
- **Pathophysiology**: The exact cause of PD is unknown; however, a combination of genetic and environmental factors have been implicated. Advancing age (> 65 years), male gender, genetics (LRRK2, glucocerebrosidase, and Parkin mutation), industrial exposure, heavy metals (manganese, copper, and lead), pesticides (rotenone, paraquat), and obstructive sleep apnea increase the risk of PD.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of PD in the US is estimated at 9.5–10.3 cases per 100,000 person-years, while its prevalence is estimated at 81 persons per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: In patients with PD, premature selective loss of dopamine neurons and accumulation of Lewy bodies causes the classical motor manifestations of parkinsonism (tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability), as well as autonomic dysfunction, cognitive dysfunction, and mood and impulse control disorders.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Patients with PD have 2.56-fold increased risk of mortality than similar age-matched individuals.

### New horizons in Parkinson's disease in older populations [^0338070c]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. Ageing is considered to be the greatest risk factor for PD, with a complex interplay between genetics and the environment. With population ageing, the prevalence of PD is expected to escalate worldwide; thus, it is of utmost importance to reduce the burden of PD. To date, there are no therapies to cure the disease, and current treatment strategies focus on the management of symptoms. Older adults often have multiple chronic diseases and geriatric syndromes, which further complicates the management of PD. Healthcare systems and care models necessary to address the broad needs of older PD patients are largely unavailable. In this New Horizon article, we discuss various aspects of PD from an ageing perspective, including disease management. We highlight recent advancements in PD therapies and discuss new care models with the potential to improve patient's quality of life.

Summary

Background

Neurological disorders are now the leading source of disability globally, and ageing is increasing the burden of neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease. We aimed to determine the global burden of Parkinson's disease between 1990 and 2016 to identify trends and to enable appropriate public health, medical, and scientific responses.

Methods

Through a systematic analysis of epidemiological studies, we estimated global, regional, and country-specific prevalence and years of life lived with disability for Parkinson's disease from 1990 to 2016. We estimated the proportion of mild, moderate, and severe Parkinson's disease on the basis of studies that used the Hoehn and Yahr scale and assigned disability weights to each level. We jointly modelled prevalence and excess mortality risk in a natural history model to derive estimates of deaths due to Parkinson's disease. Death counts were multiplied by values from the Global Burden of Disease study's standard life expectancy to compute years of life lost. Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were computed as the sum of years lived with disability and years of life lost. We also analysed results based on the Socio-demographic Index, a compound measure of income per capita, education, and fertility.

Findings

In 2016, 6·1 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 5·0–7·3) individuals had Parkinson's disease globally, compared with 2·5 million (2·0–3·0) in 1990. This increase was not solely due to increasing numbers of older people, because age-standardised prevalence rates increased by 21·7% (95% UI 18·1–25·3) over the same period (compared with an increase of 74·3%, 95% UI 69·2–79·6, for crude prevalence rates). Parkinson's disease caused 3·2 million (95% UI 2·6–4·0) DALYs and 211 296 deaths (95% UI 167 771–265 160) in 2016. The male-to-female ratios of age-standardised prevalence rates were similar in 2016 (1·40, 95% UI 1·36–1·43) and 1990 (1·37, 1·34–1·40). From 1990 to 2016, age-standardised prevalence, DALY rates, and death rates increased for all global burden of disease regions except for southern Latin America, eastern Europe, and Oceania. In addition, age-standardised DALY rates generally increased across the Socio-demographic Index.

Interpretation

Over the past generation, the global burden of Parkinson's disease has more than doubled as a result of increasing numbers of older people, with potential contributions from longer disease duration and environmental factors. Demographic and potentially other factors are poised to increase the future burden of Parkinson's disease substantially.

### Prevalence of Parkinson's disease across north America [^eadb7f96]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

Using prevalence data from the individual studies, we employed the metaforpackage within the R programming environmentto fit random-effects models for each sex and 10-year age stratum 45–54 through 85+. We represent heterogeneity using the I² statistic of Higgins and colleagues; this statistic describes the percentage of variation across studies that appears to be due to study heterogeneity rather than chance. 95% confidence intervals for the I² statistic were calculated using published methods.

For females and males, we apply the random-effects regression separately to each of our five 10-year age groups, resulting in summary coefficientssuch that the age-specific prevalence is. Similarly, our age-standardized meta-estimate is, whereis the proportional representation of each age group in the 2010 US populationsuch that. Confidence intervals forwere made by replacingin the above formula with, whereis the variance of each coefficient. We report the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles ofbased on an arbitrarily large number of samples (1 million of each). Estimates of the number of expected cases in 2020 and 2030 are calculated using the population projections for the entire nation of the US published by the US Census Bureau.

Unique among the P4 efforts, HAAS is a longitudinal study following a fixed cohort of men over an extended period of time (1965–2012). The total number of years each subject was alive constitutes the number of person-years at risk (denominator), while the number of years over which a subject had a diagnosis of PD defines the case number within a period of interest (numerator). While common assumptions regarding the Poisson distribution of rare diseases can be applied to the other efforts to generate measures of uncertainty, HAAS data require a bootstrap resampling approach. As such, we report prevalence estimates from the HAAS cohort for comparison alongside those from other research efforts and do not incorporate them into the random-effects models to derive the summary estimates.

To compare prevalence estimates generated by the four P4 projects to those produced by US Medicare records, we calculated prevalence from Medicare data for each group of US counties included in the US P4 project catchment areas (see legend to Fig. 2 for the corresponding counties).

All rates are presented for males and females aged ≥ 65 years and standardized to the US 2010 population using 5-year age strata; confidence intervals are calculated using the method of Tiwari and colleagues.

Background

Neurological disorders are now the leading source of disability globally, and ageing is increasing the burden of neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease. We aimed to determine the global burden of Parkinson's disease between 1990 and 2016 to identify trends and to enable appropriate public health, medical, and scientific responses.

Methods

Through a systematic analysis of epidemiological studies, we estimated global, regional, and country-specific prevalence and years of life lived with disability for Parkinson's disease from 1990 to 2016. We estimated the proportion of mild, moderate, and severe Parkinson's disease on the basis of studies that used the Hoehn and Yahr scale and assigned disability weights to each level. We jointly modelled prevalence and excess mortality risk in a natural history model to derive estimates of deaths due to Parkinson's disease. Death counts were multiplied by values from the Global Burden of Disease study's standard life expectancy to compute years of life lost. Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were computed as the sum of years lived with disability and years of life lost. We also analysed results based on the Socio-demographic Index, a compound measure of income per capita, education, and fertility.

Findings

In 2016, 6·1 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 5·0–7·3) individuals had Parkinson's disease globally, compared with 2·5 million (2·0–3·0) in 1990. This increase was not solely due to increasing numbers of older people, because age-standardised prevalence rates increased by 21·7% (95% UI 18·1–25·3) over the same period (compared with an increase of 74·3%, 95% UI 69·2–79·6, for crude prevalence rates). Parkinson's disease caused 3·2 million (95% UI 2·6–4·0) DALYs and 211296 deaths (95% UI 167771–265160) in 2016. The male-to-female ratios of age-standardised prevalence rates were similar in 2016 (1·40, 95% UI 1·36–1·43) and 1990 (1·37, 1·34–1·40). From 1990 to 2016, age-standardised prevalence, DALY rates, and death rates increased for all global burden of disease regions except for southern Latin America, eastern Europe, and Oceania. In addition, age-standardised DALY rates generally increased across the Socio-demographic Index.

Interpretation

Over the past generation, the global burden of Parkinson's disease has more than doubled as a result of increasing numbers of older people, with potential contributions from longer disease duration and environmental factors. Demographic and potentially other factors are poised to increase the future burden of Parkinson's disease substantially.

Second, increasing life expectancy is probably contributing to longer disease duration in individuals with Parkinson's disease and thus to higher prevalence, even if incidence remains constant and individuals with Parkinson's disease show the same time trends in mortality as the general population. Indeed, in a meta-analysisof ten studies, recent cohorts showed longer disease duration, with an increase of 2·5 years per decade. That studyshowed no clear evidence that the introduction of levodopa and improvements in Parkinson's disease care have led to improvement in survival of individuals with Parkinson's disease compared with similar individuals without Parkinson's disease. A recent studyestimated the burden of Parkinson's disease in France from 2010 to 2030 under a constant incidence scenario and assuming that the relative risk of death of individuals with Parkinson's disease relative to controls had not changed over time. It showed that the life expectancy of individuals with Parkinson's disease would be expected to increase by approximately 3 years and the age-standardised and sex-standardised prevalence rate by 12% over 20 years. As patients live with Parkinson's disease for more years and the number of individuals with advanced Parkinson's disease increases, studies will be needed to inform the distribution of the severity of the disease in representative samples with simple instruments such as the Hoehn and Yahr scale.

Extensive epidemiological studies have shown that smoking is associated with a lower incidence of Parkinson's disease. As tobacco smoking remains one of the major global drivers of premature death and disability, substantial effort has been devoted to curbing the tobacco epidemic, which has led to a global decrease of 27.5% in tobacco smoking over the past three decades. The declining prevalence of smoking may be associated with a rise in the prevalence of Parkinson's disease, which should be comprehensively considered for future projections. However, the detrimental effects of smoking on overall health far outweigh the potential benefits in terms of reducing the risk of developing Parkinson's disease. Therefore, persistently striving for a reduction in smoking rates remains imperative. We advocate against smoking as a preventive measure for Parkinson's disease.

Contrary to the trend of population ageing over the next three decades contributing more to the increase in the number of patients than in the previous three decades, we estimated that population growth would contribute much less to the global increase in Parkinson's disease cases from 2021 to 2050 compared with the period of 1990–2021, with a negative contribution in central Europe, high income Asia Pacific, eastern Europe, and East Asia. This trend is consistent with the decline in the rate of population growth projected by the United Nations in the future. As population ageing and growth were projected to be the main drivers of the increase in Parkinson's disease cases over the next three decades globally, the inevitable demographic shift will not only suggest a universal rise in Parkinson's disease prevalence but also underscore the urgent need to improve healthcare accessibility and conduct research on innovative prevention strategies, effective interventions, and disease modifying treatments for patients with Parkinson's disease. Governments will need to enhance healthcare infrastructure, fund research, and implement preventive measures effectively to manage the growing burden of Parkinson's disease. The importance of non-pharmacological and non-surgical interventions such as rehabilitation training, psychotherapy, and alternative therapies in improving patients' quality of life and delaying disease progression should be emphasised. Furthermore, the focus should be not only on assisting individuals with Parkinson's disease but also on implementing measures to alleviate the increasing burden faced by care givers.

### Incidence of parkinson disease in north America [^f87bfe7a]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Parkinson disease is the second most common age-related neurodegenerative disease in the world and is responsible for significant disability and increased risks of dementia and mortality –. Data drawn from younger onset cases, multi-incident families, individuals with risk markers for PD are crucial for exploring the molecular mechanisms of disease and identifying the clinical and biological changes occurring in the preclinical and prodromal periods, which may ultimately lead to effective neuroprotection –. In turn, population-level estimates of PD burden are crucial for health care and health policy, for advocating for appropriate research funding and insurance coverage for treatment and for minimizing drug shortages. PD incidence estimates may be influenced by multiple factors, including population age, geographical location, the prevalences of genetic and environmental risk and protective markers, and case ascertainment and diagnosis methods. Comparisons of incidence estimates from multiple datasets, using different case ascertainment and diagnosis methods, can demonstrate these variations. In this study, we report incident rates of Parkinson disease in North America, measured simultaneously across five PD epidemiology data sources which sampled middle age and older adult populations. We found that Parkinson disease incidence in persons ages 65 and older ranged from 108 to 212 per 100,000 persons. Among persons aged 45 and older, PD incidence ranged from 47 to 77 per 100,000 persons. As expected from prior studies, PD incidence increased with age and was higher among males. We also found the U.S. "PD belt", a clustering of PD diagnoses originally described using PD incidence estimates from 2005, was still present in 2012.

The highest PD estimates were generated from the diagnostic algorithm applied to the Ontario and Medicare administrative datasets. This algorithm captured cases of parkinsonism, categorized as Parkinson disease, for which the person was prescribed at least one motor symptom medication. Another study of administrative claims, from the French National Health Insurance system (Système National d ' Information Inter-Régimes de l ' Assurance Maladie) found comparable incidence rates, ranging from 74 to 140 (ages 65–74), 210–277 (ages 75–84) and 299 (ages 85–89) per 100,000. Higher PD incidence estimates are not limited to studies which use administrative claims data and broad ascertainment methods. In a prospective cohort study of male physicians, PD incidence ranged from 134/100,000 person-years (among participants ages 65–69) to 614.7/100,000 person-years among participants 85–89 years old.

### How common are the "common" neurologic disorders? [^25bdfeff]. Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the current incidence and prevalence in the United States of 12 neurologic disorders.

Methods

We summarize the strongest evidence available, using data from the United States or from other developed countries when US data were insufficient.

Results

For some disorders, prevalence is a better descriptor of impact; for others, incidence is preferable. Per 1,000 children, estimated prevalence was 5.8 for autism spectrum disorder and 2.4 for cerebral palsy; for Tourette syndrome, the data were insufficient. In the general population, per 1,000, the 1-year prevalence for migraine was 121, 7.1 for epilepsy, and 0.9 for multiple sclerosis. Among the elderly, the prevalence of Alzheimer disease was 67 and that of Parkinson disease was 9.5. For diseases best described by annual incidence per 100,000, the rate for stroke was 183, 101 for major traumatic brain injury, 4.5 for spinal cord injury, and 1.6 for ALS.

Conclusions

Using the best available data, our survey of a limited number of disorders shows that the burden of neurologic illness affects many millions of people in the United States.

### The prevalence of Parkinson's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^70556725]. Movement Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder. We sought to synthesize studies on the prevalence of PD to obtain an overall view of how the prevalence of this disease varies by age, by sex, and by geographic location. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for epidemiological studies of PD from 1985 to 2010. Data were analyzed by age group, geographic location, and sex. Geographic location was stratified by the following groups: 1) Asia, 2) Africa, 3) South America, and 4) Europe/North America/Australia. Meta-regression was used to determine whether a significant difference was present between groups. Forty-seven studies were included in the analysis. Meta-analysis of the worldwide data showed a rising prevalence of PD with age (all per 100,000): 41 in 40 to 49 years; 107 in 50 to 59 years; 173 in 55 to 64 years; 428 in 60 to 69 years; 425 in 65 to 74 years; 1087 in 70 to 79 years; and 1903 in older than age 80. A significant difference was seen in prevalence by geographic location only for individuals 70 to 79 years old, with a prevalence of 1,601 in individuals from North America, Europe, and Australia, compared with 646 in individuals from Asia (P < 0.05). A significant difference in prevalence by sex was found only for individuals 50 to 59 years old, with a prevalence of 41 in females and 134 in males (P < 0.05). PD prevalence increases steadily with age. Some differences in prevalence by geographic location and sex can be detected.

### Development of the standards of reporting of neurological disorders (STROND) checklist: a guideline for the reporting of incidence and prevalence studies in neuroepidemiology [^3fe00824]. Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

STROND reporting guideline — rationale and scope emphasize that high-quality prevalence and incidence studies of neurologic conditions that follow a systematic approach are essential for estimating the global burden and for comparisons across populations, and that descriptive epidemiologic studies inform trends, gaps, and burden estimates and can generate hypotheses. Key reporting challenges in neurologic disorders include that diagnosis may require sophisticated technology such as MRI or measuring biomarkers from plasma and CSF, there can be considerable heterogeneity in latency periods with long gaps between onset and symptoms, pathologic confirmation in vivo may be difficult or unavailable, and many neurologic conditions are rare. The authors aim to develop a reporting guideline that outlines the key information to be reported for descriptive health policy research (such as Global Burden of Disease and Injuries [GBD]-type studies). Motivating gaps cited include inconsistencies in methodologies and reporting quality in multiple sclerosis studies across the Americas, frequent lack of age-specific prevalence rates of dementia in Parkinson disease, and that the GBD 2013 report found Alzheimer disease estimates would be improved by more population-based prevalence studies that use the ICD and standardized definitions and methods.

### Global, regional, and national burden of Parkinson's disease, 1990–2016: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2016 [^5eefbba6]. The Lancet: Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Methods

Overview

The general methods for the studies on the global, regional, and national burden of neurological disorders have been published previously, and key aspects are summarised in the appendix. Additional information on derivation of non-fatal and fatal estimates are provided in the appendix as well as on.

Data sources

The International Classification of Diseases ninth revision (ICD-9) codes used in cause of death analyses for Parkinson's disease are 332 (Parkinson's disease), 332.0 (paralysis agitans), and 332.1 (secondary parkinsonism), and the corresponding ICD-10 codes are G20 (Parkinson's disease), G21 (secondary parkinsonism), and G22 (parkinsonism in diseases classified elsewhere). The reference case definition for Parkinson's disease used in many epidemiological studies is the presence of at least two of the four primary symptoms: rest tremor, bradykinesia, stiffness of the limbs and torso, and postural instability. We also accepted alternative definitions, including the UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank criteria, in addition to ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes, a doctor's diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, and the prescription of Parkinson's disease-specific medications. We also added 3 years of medical claims data (years 2000, 2010, and 2012) from the USA; for a disease such as Parkinson's disease, the data from claims sources would be expected to match true prevalence under the expectation that most patients would be receiving medical attention each year. If datapoints from epidemiological studies spanned ages of more than 20 years, we split the datapoints using the age pattern from the USA, for which the most detailed age data were available.

### Prevalence of Parkinson's disease across north America [^fe59b063]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Despite the fact that the P4 prevalence estimates other than HAAS are similar to each other, our sample sizes are large enough to document significant heterogeneity and this heterogeneity is mirrored in the subgroup over age 65 years by corresponding variations in estimates based solely on Medicare records when adjusting for age and sex. We find this suggestive that — even within North America — the prevalence of PD that has come to medical attention does vary by region. Geographic variations in PD prevalence within the US have also been reported previously using solely Medicare data: Willis et al.found two- to ten-fold variations in PD prevalence between US counties. Whether or not these differences reflect variations in health-care seeking practices or access to care (including access to neurologists) or regional differences in environmental or genetic determinants of disease cannot be determined by our study and remain an important question for future research.

The heterogeneity must be kept in mind when expressing the prevalence of PD in North America as a single number. The meta-estimate is generated from projects sampling from a few disparate regions and we did not account for the heterogeneity that likely exists in other regions of North America. There is additional evidence for ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic variation in PD prevalence in North America. A study of continental American and Alaskan nativesreported a prevalence of 822/100,000 over age 40 years standardized to the 2000 US population, which is higher than most estimates from other places and ethnic groups worldwide. As previously mentioned, analysis of the Medicare nationwide database found a higher prevalence in Whites and Hispanics than in Black or Asian individuals. That same study found Copiah County, Mississippi, USA to have one of the lowest prevalence rates in the country and also revealed other geographic variations within the US. The geographic areas from which our data are drawn have a lower proportion of individuals of Black race than the US overall. Thus not taking these racial distributions into account would result in a higher estimate of PD prevalence for the entire US. Despite this potential bias, we believe that our estimates underestimate the total burden for reasons explained further below.

Disease model

For Parkinson's disease, we have seen large inconsistencies between the cause of death data and the non-fatal data. For example, US vital registration data show a greater than three times increase in the age-standardised rates of death from Parkinson's disease since 1980 without a corresponding increase in the prevalence data over the same time period (appendix). Likewise, we found a greater than 25 times difference across different countries in age-standardised mortality rates for the most recent year of vital registration data available at the time of GBD 2016 (see), and we did not see such heterogeneity between countries in our non-fatal data. Therefore, these differences are probably the result of changes and inconsistencies in coding practices for certifying deaths from Parkinson's disease. To correct for this bias, we jointly modelled the prevalence and mortality from Parkinson's disease. First, we ran an initial cause of death model using CODEm, the cause of death ensemble model used throughout GBD, and an initial non-fatal model using DisMod-MR 2.1, the Bayesian meta-regression tool developed for GBD. The initial CODEm model used 14 990 site-years of data (ie, a unique combination of calendar year and country) as well as predictive covariates of SDI, cumulative cigarette consumption, health-care access and quality, education, and mean cholesterol level (a full list of predictive covariates is in the appendix). The initial DisMod-MR 2.1 model included settings of no remission (ie, no cure) and no incidence before the age of 20 years because the disease is exceptional before that age. We excluded all incidence data from the model, since we saw inconsistencies between the available prevalence and incidence data, and we considered measurement error less likely to occur with prevalence data than with incidence data. We let DisMod-MR 2.1 adjust medical claims data to correct for any systematic under-reporting and datapoints with case definitions that differed from the reference. Smoking prevalence and SDI were used as predictive covariates in the model.

### Prevalence of Parkinson's disease across north America [^96af6107]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Results

The populations studied (aged ≥ 45 years) ranged in size from 8006 (Honolulu-Asia Aging Study (HAAS)) to 5,525,787 (Ontario). The number of cases identified by project ranged from 207 to 28,065. Table 1 shows the case numbers, denominators, and prevalence estimates for each project by sex. The supplementary table provides prevalence further broken down by age group. Figure 1 displays the prevalence estimates closest to 2010 for each project and provides the meta-analytic estimate for each age group by sex. The prevalence within age strata below the age of 65 years for males and below the age of 75 years for females have confidence intervals for I² containing nearly its entire possible range, which implies that our results do not contain enough information to rule heterogeneity in or out. For older ages, heterogeneity is demonstrated. The estimates were higher in men than in women and rose with age in both sexes. Using Kaiser Permanente Northern California Integrated Health Care System (KPNC), Ontario, Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP), and California Parkinson's disease Registry-Pilot Project (CPDR-PP) data, the combined prevalence for men and women aged > 45 years standardized by age and sex to the US population according to the 2010 US census was 572 per 100,000 (95% confidence intervals 537–614). For females, the prevalence was 488 (444–543), and for males 667 (612–732). Based on published data, we calculated the prevalence of parkinsonism as estimated by the Copiah County studystandardized to the US population (2010) to be 301 per 100,000 (Table 2). Using our age- and sex-specific meta-estimates and applying these to the US population according to the 2010 census, we would expect 680,000 cases of PD in the US among individuals aged ≥ 45 years. Given the projected population structure for future years and assuming stable age and sex-specific prevalences, we estimate that this number would rise to 930,000 cases in 2020 and 1,238,000 by 2030.

### Risk of dementia in Parkinson's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^8d64caab]. Movement Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Estimates of the risk of dementia in Parkinson's disease (PDD) vary widely. We aimed to review the incidence of PDD and in a meta-analysis estimate the pooled annual incidence and relative risk of PDD while also exploring factors that may contribute to heterogeneity between studies. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed and MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for articles reporting the number of cases of dementia in a population, followed longitudinally, with a minimum of 100 dementia-free Parkinson's disease (PD) patients at baseline. Meta-analyses and meta-regressions were used to estimate the pooled incidence rate of PDD and the relative risk of PDD versus healthy controls (HC). A total of 32 studies were identified, 25 reporting the incidence of PDD and 10 reporting the relative risk of PDD versus HC. The pooled incidence rate of PDD was 4.45 (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.91–4.99) per 100 person-years at risk, equating to a 4.5% annual risk of dementia in a PD prevalent population. The relative risk of PDD was estimated to be 3.25 (95% CI, 2.62–4.03) times greater than HC. Factors contributing to study heterogeneity and disparities in the estimated risk of PDD include the age of patients, year of recruitment, and study location. Significant gaps remain with no studies identified in several geographical regions. Future studies should stratify by age and standardize reporting to reduce overall heterogeneity. © 2024 The Author(s).

Severity and years lived with disability

To calculate years lived with disability (YLDs) for Parkinson's disease, we split the overall prevalence from the second DisMod-MR 2.1 model into three severity categories using data reporting on the Hoehn and Yahr stages. We used 30 unique sources, covering nine of 21 world regions, and equated a score of 2·0 or less on the Hoehn and Yahr scale to mild Parkinson's disease, a score of 2·5–3·0 to moderate Parkinson's disease, and a score of 4·0–5·0 to severe Parkinson's disease (appendix). These data informed meta-analyses of the proportion of Parkinson's disease that is mild, moderate, and severe. We then used these proportions to split the overall prevalence of Parkinson's disease into the severity categories. Finally, we multiplied the prevalence of each severity category by severity-specific disability weights(see appendix for a detailed description) to calculate YLDs. YLDs were then corrected for comorbidity with a simulation that assigned all non-fatal outcomes to hypothetical individuals and adjusted disability in patients who had multiple conditions.

Risk estimation

Of the 84 risks quantified in GBD 2016, only smoking was judged to have sufficient evidence for a relationship with Parkinson's disease, with smoking associated with decreased risk. The main sources of exposure data were population-based surveys. We used the estimates of exposure, relative risk, and a theoretical minimum level of exposure of zero lifetime cigarettes smoked to calculate population attributable fractions. Further information on risk factor calculations can be found in the GBD 2016 risk factors paper.

Compilation of results

We calculated years of life lost (YLLs) by multiplying the number of deaths in an age group by the remaining life expectancy in that age group, taken from the GBD standard life table. Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were then calculated as the sum of YLLs and YLDs.

Through each computational step, uncertainty was propagated by sampling 1000 draws, which allowed us to combine the uncertainty from input data, corrections to the data, and residual non-sampling error. Uncertainty intervals (UIs) were defined as the 25th and 975th values of the ordered draws.

### Incidence of parkinson disease in north America [^26b8810d]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

The male: female ratio for incident PD increased with age in all epidemiological cohorts in our study, consistent with the previous data that supports the hypothesis that biological sex is an intrinsic risk factor for PD –. A 2015 meta-analysis of PD incidence data from 22 studies which included age/sex-specific data found the overall M:F incidence ratio was 1.57 (95% CI 1.46 to 1.68, p < 0.001), and that age-specific pooled M:F incidence ratios increased from 1.46 (95% CI 1.33–1.61) between 60 and 79 years to 1.93 (95% CI 1.84–2.03) in persons above 80 years. Our finding of a decrease in the M:F sex ratio when we included individuals with age at onset as low as 45 indirectly supports the theory that sex differences in PD risk increase with age. Monogenic risk factors for PD are equally distributed in males and females, and associate with earlier onset disease. Sporadic PD risk is positively correlated with age, as are the potential cumulative influences of non-genetic risk markers that may differ by gender, including occupational, neuroendocrine, and hormonal exposures, lifestyle factors –.

In this study, we estimated the incidence of Parkinson disease simultaneously across five epidemiological datasets using commonly applied diagnosis and case ascertainment methods applied to 2012 data. We established a range of total incident PD diagnoses in North America of approximately 60,000 to 95,000 among adults ages 45 and older. Using the Medicare administrative database alone for this same time period suggests an incident rate of PD of nearly 90,000 per annum just for those 65 and older. As discussed above, regarding the ascertainment methods for each dataset, this range in incidence likely represents the lower and upper bounds of those diagnosed with PD in 2012. Nevertheless, this contrasts sharply with the estimate of 40,000–60,000 new cases per annum that has been cited previously for PD incidence. The reasons for a greater incidence as compared to prior studies, particularly those drawn from data prior to 2010, remains to be explained, but could represent either improved ascertainment and clinical recognition of PD or reflect the impact of risk factors for PD. The confirmation of an increased trend of PD in different geographic areas, populations, and datasets does not support the theory that our findings are spurious.

### Projections for prevalence of Parkinson's disease and its driving factors in 195 countries and territories to 2050: modelling study of global burden of disease study 2021 [^43b3e2d8]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Limitations of study

This study had several important limitations in modelling for projection. Firstly, the forecasting model did not directly incorporate risk factors other than Socio-demographic Index and demographic factors, primarily owing to unavailability of data and failure to meet the inclusion criteria of the Global Burden of Disease Study for risk factors. Insufficient robust evidence supports a causal relation between these risk factors and Parkinson's disease, and the Global Burden of Disease Study has not provided data for forecasting the prevalence of risk factors, except for smoking. For trends not explained by Socio-demographic Index and demographic factors, we integrated them into forecasts by using the ARIMA method. Secondly, when calculating population attributable fractions, we included no more risk factors in analysis for paucity of prevalence data and corresponding prevalence ratio values, apart from smoking and physical inactivity. The results of population attributable fractions and potential impact fractions should be interpreted cautiously owing to the uncertainty about the lag effects of risk factors. Thirdly, as the prediction of future prevalence is based on prevalence trends in previous years, this forecast inherits the limitation of low availability and quality of data in some regions. The statistics for these data sparse regions had to rely on predictive modelling using covariates. This can accentuate the influence of developed areas with more data, thereby affecting global and regional patterns. Fourthly, we could not accurately predict the prevalence of Parkinson's disease in various ethnic groups or that of genetic Parkinson's disease owing to a lack of data. Fifthly, the use of clinical criteria for diagnosing Parkinson's disease in Global Burden of Disease 2021 may result in a certain degree of deviation in the prevalence rate, which could be improved with advances in diagnostic biomarkers. Therefore, caution should be exercised when interpreting the projection for Parkinson's disease prevalence based on Global Burden of Disease 2021. Sixthly, we did not directly take into account the effect of incidence and mortality on prevalence in our prediction model. The Global Burden of Disease 2021 Collaborators not only identified inconsistencies between the incidence and prevalence of Parkinson's disease, as well as between mortality and prevalence of Parkinson's disease, but also indicated potential uncertainties and significant variation in both the incidence and mortality rates of Parkinson's disease, which may negatively affect the accuracy of predictions for Parkinson's disease prevalence. Seventhly, spatial autocorrelation was not accounted for in our prediction. We attempted to incorporate spatial autocorrelation into our model by using a spatial weight matrix; however, it did not improve the predictive accuracy of the model (supplementary methods section 1.10). Finally, our projections only indirectly took into account the impact of covid-19 on the prevalence of Parkinson's disease, as the data source for our projection, Global Burden of Disease 2021, has estimated its effect on the prevalence of Parkinson's disease. Research is needed to understand the long term effects of potential infectious disease outbreaks on neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, advances in diagnosis, new drugs and therapies, and improved management may contribute to the change in Parkinson's disease prevalence. Therefore, projections need to be updated as important new factors that influence Parkinson's disease prevalence emerge.

### Trends in mortality from parkinson disease in the United States, 1999–2019 [^b75ab8e3]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

The mortality from Parkinson disease (PD) and its long-term trends in the United States in recent decades remains unknown. This study aimed to describe the trends in PD mortality in the United States from 1999 to 2019.

Methods

We used data from the National Vital Statistics System, a nationwide, population-based death registry, to determine national trends in PD mortality, overall and by age, sex, race/ethnicity, urban-rural classification, and geographic location. Analyses focused on the data from 479,059 deaths due to PD from 1999 to 2019. Joinpoint regression was performed to examine temporal trends in age-adjusted death rates.

Results

The age-adjusted mortality from PD increased from 5.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.3–5.5) per 100,000 population in 1999 to 8.8 (95% CI, 8.7–8.9) per 100,000 population in 2019, with an average annual percent change of 2.4% (95% CI, 1.8%-3.0%). From 1999 to 2019, PD mortality increased significantly across all age groups, both sexes, various racial/ethnic groups, and different urban-rural classifications. The US states and District of Columbia with reported death rates all experienced an increase in PD mortality. Significant differences by sex and race/ethnicity were noted. Age-adjusted PD mortality rates were twice as high in men as in women and were greater in White individuals than those from other racial/ethnic groups.

Discussion

From 1999 to 2019, the mortality from PD in the United States has increased significantly. The increase was regardless of age, sex, race/ethnicity, urban-rural classification, and geographic location. A comprehensive evaluation of long-term trends in PD mortality is important for health care priority setting.

### Time trends in the incidence of parkinson disease [^ba2a5da7]. JAMA Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Changes over time in the incidence of parkinsonism and Parkinson disease (PD) remain uncertain.

Objective

To investigate secular trends (period effects) and birth cohort trends in the incidence of parkinsonism and PD over 30 years in a geographically defined American population.

Design, Setting, and Participants

We used the medical records-linkage system of the Rochester Epidemiology Project to identify incidence cases of PD and other types of parkinsonism in Olmsted County, Minnesota, from 1976 to 2005. All cases were classified by a movement disorder specialist using defined criteria through the review of the complete medical records within the system. The analyses for this study were conducted between May 2015 and January 2016.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Incidence rates of parkinsonism and PD over 30 years. We tested for secular trends (period effects) using negative binomial regression models and for birth cohort effects using age-period-cohort models.

Results

Of 906 patients with parkinsonism, 501 were men, and the median age at onset was 74 years (interquartile range, 66–81 years). Of the 464 patients with PD, 275 were men, and the median age at onset was 73 years (interquartile range, 64–80 years). The overall incidence rates increased significantly over 30 years in men for both parkinsonism (relative risk [RR], 1.17 per decade; 95% CI, 1.03–1.33) and PD (RR, 1.24 per decade; 95% CI, 1.08–1.43). These trends were driven primarily by the older age groups. In particular, for men 70 years or older, incidence rates increased for both parkinsonism (RR, 1.24 per decade; 95% CI, 1.07–1.44) and PD (RR, 1.35 per decade; 95% CI, 1.10–1.65). The secular trends were not significant for women overall or in age strata. We observed an increased risk for both men and women born in the 1920 cohort (1915–1924). However, this birth cohort effect was significant only for PD and only in men.

Conclusions and Revelance

Our study suggests that the incidence of parkinsonism and PD may have increased between 1976 and 2005, particularly in men 70 years and older. These trends may be associated with the dramatic changes in smoking behavior that took place in the second half of the 20th century or with other lifestyle or environmental changes. However, the trends could be spurious and need to be confirmed in other populations.

### State-level prevalence, health service use, and spending vary widely among Medicare beneficiaries with parkinson disease [^623ee956]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

We noted in our sample that women comprised close to half of the PD population in some states. Other epidemiologic studies have shown that the incidence and prevalence of PD among women is lower than that of men. It is important to point out the distinction between disease prevalence and proportion of a disease population with a specific characteristic. When CMS datasets are used to calculate PD prevalence and incidence, the expected male:female ratio of 1.5:1 is observed. In this study, we focused our sex data calculations on the PD sample alone and report the proportion of Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with PD that is female, not the prevalence of PD among female Medicare beneficiaries. Female Medicare beneficiaries outnumber male beneficiaries, and women have a greater life expectancy, both in the general populationand among individuals with PD. Thus, our finding that nearly half of Medicare beneficiaries with PD are female is expected. Although women diagnosed with PD are a sizable portion of the PD population, they are highly under-represented in PD research and clinical trials. Recent data suggests that current payer models and care patterns do not meet the needs of women with PD, who have less access to specialized care and greater unreimbursed care needs. Improving PD outcomes will require increased attention to women with PD, from both research and clinical perspectives, especially given that almost half of the Medicare PD population is made up of women.

The concept of comparing Medicare utilization and cost by state was pioneered by the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care, and their data showing significant variation has led to efforts to improve health systems across the US. – In the general population, such variation is suggested to be due to regional differences in health care seeking behavior, increased need due to greater comorbid disease burden or social determinants of health, or increased availability of providers. Hospitalization for PD specialist care, such as deep brain stimulator (DBS) implantation, could contribute to our observed differences, particularly in states with multiple academic centers, however previous research has demonstrated that DBS use among Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with PD is very low. In particular, our data on hospitalizations and readmissions do not follow a pattern consistent with provider availability. Excess hospitalizations and readmissions of PD patients occurred in Southern and Midwest states, which are known to have health provider shortages. Future studies will examine the nature of hospitalizations of PD patients and determine the extent to which they are PD related or avoidable (i.e. due to medication misadventure, ambulatory care sensitive condition).

### Incidence and prevalence of Parkinson's disease among navajo people living in the navajo nation [^60109959]. Movement Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is largely unstudied among American Indians. Unique populations might harbor clues to elusive causes. We describe the incidence and prevalence of PD among Navajo people residing in the Navajo Nation, home to the largest American Indian tribe in the United States. We analyzed 2001–2011 inpatient and outpatient visit data for Navajo people obtained from the Indian Health Service, which provides health care to American Indian people living on the Navajo Reservation. Cases were defined by at least two inpatient or outpatient visits with the diagnosis of PD. Crude and age-adjusted incidence and prevalence rates were calculated overall as well as by age, sex, region of residence, and time period. Five hundred twenty-four Navajo people with median age-at-onset of 74.0 years were diagnosed with PD during the study period, yielding an average annual crude incidence rate of 22.5/100,000. Age-specific incidence was 232.0 for patients 65 years of age or older and 302.0 for 80 years of age or older. Age-adjusted incidence was 35.9 overall (238.1 for ≥ 65 years), was higher in men than in women (47.5 vs. 27.7; P < 0.001), varied by region (P = 0.03), and was similar between time periods (2002–2004 vs. 2009–2011). The age-adjusted point prevalence rate was 261.0. The rate of PD among Navajo People appears to be as high as or higher than rates reported in many other populations. Rates increased to the highest age group, consistent with population-based studies. Further investigation is warranted to examine risk factors for PD in this remote population.

### Global trends and projections of Parkinson's disease incidence: a 30-year analysis using GBD 2021 data [^ece9206d]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons, leading to motor dysfunction and non-motor symptoms like cognitive decline and depression. With the aging global population, PD incidence is anticipated to rise, especially in regions with rapidly growing elderly populations. This study leverages Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 data to analyze the burden of PD by region, sex, and age group, examining trends from 1992 to 2021 and projecting the future burden to 2030.

Methods

Data from the GBD 2021 database for the years 1992–2021 were analyzed to assess age-standardized incidence rates (ASIR) and mortality of PD across socio-demographic index (SDI) regions, sex, and age groups. The Age-Period-Cohort (APC) model was used to explore temporal trends, while the Bayesian Age-Period-Cohort (BAPC) model projected future PD burden from 2022 to 2030.

Results

From 1992 to 2021, global PD cases increased from 450,000 to 1.34 million, with crude incidence rates rising from 8.19 to 16.92 per 100,000 and ASIR from 11.54 to 15.63 per 100,000, indicating an annual net drift of 1.11% (95% CI 1.06%-1.17%), reflecting a growing burden driven by an aging population. All SDI regions saw a growth in PD burden, with the highest increases in middle- and high-middle-SDI regions, where male incidence was notably higher than female. Incidence rates escalated sharply in individuals aged 60 and older, peaking in those aged 85 and above. Projections suggest that by 2030, global PD cases will reach 1.93 million, with an ASIR of 27 per 100,000.

Discussion

The findings highlight a sustained global increase in PD burden, particularly in middle- and high-income regions and among men. In low-SDI areas, PD burden may be underestimated due to limited healthcare access and diagnostic challenges. These results stress the urgent need for health policies focused on elderly populations, especially men, and call for effective prevention and intervention strategies to mitigate the future impact of PD.

### Global, regional, and national burden of Parkinson's disease, 1990–2016: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2016 [^d8a1d023]. The Lancet: Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

In 2016, 6·1 million (95% UI 5·0–7·3) individuals worldwide had Parkinson's disease, of whom 2·9 million (47·5%) were women and 3·2 million (52·5%) were men. 2·1 million (34·4%) of these individuals were from high SDI countries, 3·1 million (50·8%) from high-middle or middle SDI countries, and 0·9 million (14·8%) from low-middle or low SDI countries (table). The number of individuals with Parkinson's disease in 2016 was 2·4 times higher than in 1990 (2·5 million, 95% UI 2·0–3·0). In 1990, 1·1 million (44·0%) cases were in high SDI countries, 1·1 million (44·0%) in high-middle or middle SDI countries, and 0·3 million (12·0%) in low-middle or low SDI countries. The increase in the number of patients with Parkinson's disease worldwide between 1990 and 2016 was not explained exclusively by an increasing number of older people, because global age-standardised prevalence rates increased by 21·7% (95% UI 18·1–25·3) from 1990 to 2016 compared with an increase of 74·3% (69·2–79·6) for crude prevalence rates. The increase in the number of patients with Parkinson's disease between 1990 and 2016 was less pronounced in high SDI countries (9·2%, 95% UI 5·5–13·2) than in other countries, and the largest increase was seen in middle SDI countries (59·8%, 53·2–66·1). The increase in age-standardised prevalence rates between 1990 and 2016 was similar in men (21·4%, 95% UI 17·6–24·9) and women (19·3%, 15·7–22·7). Age-standardised prevalence rates of Parkinson's disease by country varied greater than five times, with the highest rates generally in high-income North America and lowest rates in sub-Saharan Africa (figure 1).

Third, the increase in Parkinson's disease burden might be linked to environmental factors tied to the growing industrialisation of the world. In general, better health is positively associated with socioeconomic level. However, with Parkinson's disease, the opposite is true; age-standardised DALY rates due to Parkinson's disease increased with SDI. The reason for this association is not clear. Some environmental exposures tied to industrialisation, including pesticides, solvents, or metals, which are also more common in high SDI countries, might contribute to the increased incidence of Parkinson's disease. For example, in China (a middle SDI country), which has undergone rapid industrial growth since 1990, the age-adjusted prevalence rates of Parkinson's disease more than doubled between 1990 and 2016, the largest increase worldwide. If environmental factors related to industrialisation played a part, an increase in incidence over time would be expected. A few studies have examined time trends in incidence of Parkinson's disease, with inconsistent findings. A study in the USAsuggested that incidence increased by 24% (95% CI 8–43) per decade between 1976 and 2005 in men but not in women. By contrast, in the Netherlands, the Rotterdam Studyreported a substantial decrease in Parkinson's disease incidence between 1990 and 2011, without any obvious explanation. One study in Canadaand another in the USAstudy showed no significant time trends. In Finland, using the Finnish National Prescription Register, the incidence of Parkinson's disease increased between 1997 and 2014 both in rural and urban regions. High-quality prospective cohort studies and detailed registries are needed to survey time trends in the worldwide incidence of Parkinson's disease more accurately and understand the factors that might be driving time trends. Alternative explanations for the positive association between the burden of Parkinson's disease and SDI include better ascertainment of Parkinson's disease in higher SDI countries through better study methods or health-care access and disease recognition. However, in lower SDI countries, we included door-to-door studies, when available, that are considered to be less prone to underestimation.

### Projections for prevalence of Parkinson's disease and its driving factors in 195 countries and territories to 2050: modelling study of global burden of disease study 2021 [^23f2e4f8]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Global trend of Parkinson's disease prevalence

Our projections indicate a global increase in the prevalence of Parkinson's disease across various regions, both sexes, and different age groups. The upward trend of Parkinson's disease prevalence will be driven by ongoing processes of industrialisation, urbanisation, population ageing, significant environmental changes, and other contributing factors. The decomposition analysis suggests that population ageing will be the leading contributor to the increasing number of Parkinson's disease cases from 2021 to 2050 globally and in all Socio-demographic Index regions. We estimated that the 76% rise in global all age prevalence of Parkinson's disease would be juxtaposed with a 55% rise in age standardised prevalence from 2021 to 2050. Moreover, we expected people aged 60–79 years to have the highest number of prevalent cases and those aged ≥ 80 years to have the highest prevalence in 2050 and the highest increase in number of Parkinson's disease cases. These projections are consistent with the notion that ageing is the predominant risk factor for Parkinson's disease. Global Burden of Disease 2017 estimated that the proportion of the world population aged over 65 years would increase from 9.3% in 2021 to 16.9% in 2050, and the world population of those aged ≥ 85 was projected to triple in the same time span. The inevitable consequence of population ageing is the escalation in the prevalence of Parkinson's disease. Several major molecular hallmarks of brain ageing overlap with mechanisms implicated in neurodegeneration of Parkinson's disease. Ageing is associated with the impairment of cellular pathways, which renders dopaminergic neurons vulnerable to environmental and genetic factors, thus promoting α-synuclein pathology. Intervening in the drivers of ageing to achieve healthy ageing is likely to help to prevent Parkinson's disease.

Objective

To predict the global, regional, and national prevalence of Parkinson's disease by age, sex, year, and Socio-demographic Index to 2050 and quantify the factors driving changes in Parkinson's disease cases.

Design

Modelling study.

Data Source

Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.

Main Outcome Measures

Prevalent number, all age prevalence and age standardised prevalence of Parkinson's disease in 2050, and average annual percentage change of prevalence from 2021 to 2050; contribution of population ageing, population growth, and changes in prevalence to the growth in Parkinson's disease cases; population attributable fractions for modifiable factors.

Results

25.2 (95% uncertainty interval 21.7 to 30.1) million people were projected to be living with Parkinson's disease worldwide in 2050, representing a 112% (95% uncertainty interval 71% to 152%) increase from 2021. Population ageing (89%) was predicted to be the primary contributor to the growth in cases from 2021 to 2050, followed by population growth (20%) and changes in prevalence (3%). The prevalence of Parkinson's disease was forecasted to be 267 (230 to 320) cases per 100000 in 2050, indicating a significant increase of 76% (56% to 125%) from 2021, whereas the age standardised prevalence was predicted to be 216 (168 to 281) per 100000, with an increase of 55% (50% to 60%) from 2021. Countries in the middle fifth of Socio-demographic Index were projected to have the highest percentage increase in the all age prevalence (144%, 87% to 183%) and age standardised prevalence (91%, 82% to 101%) of Parkinson's disease between 2021 and 2050. Among Global Burden of Disease regions, East Asia (10.9 (9.0 to 13.3) million) was projected to have the highest number of Parkinson's disease cases in 2050, with western Sub-Saharan Africa (292%, 266% to 362%) experiencing the most significant increase from 2021. The ≥ 80 years age group was projected to have the greatest increase in the number of Parkinson's disease cases (196%, 143% to 235%) from 2021 to 2050. The male-to-female ratios of age standardised prevalence of Parkinson's disease were projected to increase from 1.46 in 2021 to 1.64 in 2050 globally.

Conclusions

By 2050 Parkinson's disease will have become a greater public health challenge for patients, their families, care givers, communities, and society. The upward trend is expected to be more pronounced among countries with middle Socio-demographic Index, in the Global Burden of Disease East Asia region, and among men. This projection could serve as an aid in promoting health research, informing policy decisions, and allocating resources.

Methods

Overview

On the basis of Global Burden of Disease 2021, we estimated the age, sex, and year specific prevalence of Parkinson's disease in 195 countries and territories from 2022 to 2050. We calculated the average annual percentage change to examine temporal trends in forecasted prevalence of Parkinson's disease. We did decomposition analysis to assess the relative contributions of population growth, population ageing, and changes in prevalence to changes in Parkinson's disease cases between 2021 and 2050. We used exposure levels and the prevalence ratio to estimate the population attributable fractions and potential impact fractions for modifiable factors of Parkinson's disease. This study adhered to the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER), ensuring transparent reporting of health estimates (supplementary table S1).

Data sources and definitions

The case definition of Parkinson's disease in Global Burden of Disease 2021 was the presence of at least two of the four primary symptoms: rest tremor, bradykinesia, limb and trunk stiffness, and postural instability. Alternative diagnostic criteria such as the UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank criteria and the Movement Disorder Society clinical diagnostic criteria for Parkinson's disease, as well as ICD9 and ICD10 (international classification of disease, 9th and 10th revision) codes (ICD9: 332–332.0; ICD10: F02.3, G20-G20.9), diagnosis of Parkinson's disease by a medical professional, and prescription of Parkinson's disease specific medications were also accepted. We used Global Burden of Disease 2021 to obtain the age, sex, year, and location specific prevalence data for Parkinson's disease from 1990 to 2021. We used Global Burden of Disease 2019 to obtain prevalence data for exposure factors such as current smoking and used the data for calculating Socio-demographic Index, including total fertility under 25 years old, mean education for individuals aged ≥ 15, and lag distributed income per capita. The prevalence of physical activity came from the WHO Global Health Observatory. We calculated the prevalence ratio for Parkinson's disease associated with physical activity on the basis of seven eligible studies included in the meta-analysis published in 2024. We derived the prevalence ratio for Parkinson's disease associated with smoking from our updated meta-analysis, building on the previous meta-analysis published in 2012 (supplementary methods section 1.1). The forecasted population data by age, sex, year, and location came from Global Burden of Disease 2017.

The upward trend is expected to be more pronounced among countries with middle Socio-demographic Index, in the Global Burden of Disease East Asia region, and among men. This projection could serve as an aid in promoting health research, informing policy decisions, and allocating resources.

Population attributable fractions and potential impact fractions of modifiable factors

In this study, two modifiable factors for Parkinson's disease were eligible according to the World Cancer Research Fund evidence grading criteria applied by Global Burden of Disease 2021: smoking and physical activity. We used population attributable fractions to quantify the proportion of Parkinson's disease cases that would be changed if exposure to a given factor was entirely eliminated. We assumed that the association between modifiable factors and Parkinson's disease was constant worldwide. We estimated the total number of Parkinson's disease cases attributable to each modifiable factor by multiplying the population attributable fraction estimates by the number of Parkinson's disease cases. Moreover, to evaluate the potential impact of a partial increase or decrease in modifiable factors on the proportion of Parkinson's disease cases, we modelled the potential impact fractions resulting from a proportionate increase or decrease (20%) in prevalence of each factor. The detailed methods are described in supplementary methods sections 1.7 and 1.8.

Compilation of results

We projected the prevalence of Parkinson's disease for both sexes, 16 age groups, and 195 countries and territories from 2022 to 2050. Additionally, we assigned countries to a fifth of Socio-demographic Index according to their estimated values on these indicators in 2021. The unit used in this study was per 100 000 population for both the all age and the age standardised prevalence of Parkinson's disease. For the age standardised prevalence, we used a standard population calculated as the non-weighted average across all countries of the percentage of the population in each five year age group from 2010 to 2035. Uncertainty was propagated through all calculations by sampling 1000 draws at each step of the calculations, which enabled us to carry through uncertainty from multiple sources, including input data, corrections of measurement error, and estimates of residual non-sampling error. We determined the 95% uncertainty intervals for Parkinson's disease prevalence as the 2.5th and 97.5th centiles of the posterior distributions. Otherwise, we calculated 95% confidence intervals for the data pertaining to average annual percentage change, population attributable fractions, and potential impact fractions.

Figure 2 shows the prevalence estimates for the studies of California, Olmsted County, Minnesota, and Hawaii juxtaposed with the prevalence estimates derived from US Medicare data from the corresponding counties. Because Medicare beneficiaries are aged ≥ 65 years, we employ the portions of study subjects matching this age restriction. For two studies (CPDR-PP and HAAS), prevalence rates were statistically indistinguishable from the Medicare estimates. In contrast, the Rochester Epidemiology Project (Olmsted County) identified 14–27% more cases, and the KPNC approximately 30% more. However, the pattern of variation between regions is reproduced regardless of whether Medicare data or the P4 study data are used (Fig. 2).

### State-level prevalence, health service use, and spending vary widely among Medicare beneficiaries with parkinson disease [^c5741579]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this descriptive study, we determined that among Medicare beneficiaries, there is significant state-level variation in PD prevalence, demography, dual-eligible status, and spending. States which have a higher prevalence of PD may have a larger proportion of high-risk factor patient groups, a higher concentration of providers who recognize and document PD, increased public awareness of PD symptoms, or increased health care seeking behaviors among people living in the state. Among our top PD prevalence states, Florida and New York also rank high in terms of absolute number of Medicare beneficiaries, and have large supplies of health care providers. Environmental factors, including exposure to exogenous toxicants (such as pesticides, heavy metals, or solvents) vary by location and may influence our prevalence estimates by altering the risk of PD or of a PD diagnosis. There are proposed protective factors for PD, such as coffee consumption, and exercise habits, but it is not clear whether these vary sufficiently across states to impact PD prevalence estimates. Finally, prevalence calculations can be impacted by differential mortality. Future research will seek to understand the geographic variation of PD in terms of differences in risk, mortality, and diagnostic accuracy.

### Projections for prevalence of Parkinson's disease and its driving factors in 195 countries and territories to 2050: modelling study of global burden of disease study 2021 [^c0ff56b1]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Projection by location and Socio-demographic Index

Although we estimated that most countries and regions will face a growing prevalence of Parkinson's disease in the foreseeable future to 2050, its spatial and temporal trends will vary considerably by geographical location and socioeconomic status, possibly reflecting secular changes in population structure, lifestyle, and toxic milieu related to industrialisation and urbanisation. The health level is expected to be higher in countries with a better socioeconomic status; however, the opposite holds true for Parkinson's disease. We estimated that from 1990 to 2050, the age standardised prevalence of Parkinson's disease would generally increase with Socio-demographic Index across the 21 Global Burden of Disease regions. A higher Socio-demographic Index indicates a greater level of social development, an increased degree of ageing, elevated life expectancy due to favourable medical conditions, and heightened exposure to risk factors resulting from industrialisation and urbanisation. These factors may partially explain the projected trend that countries with high-middle Socio-demographic Index will maintain the highest prevalence of Parkinson's disease in 2050, whereas low Socio-demographic Index countries will have the lowest prevalence and age standardised prevalence of Parkinson's disease. The middle Socio-demographic Index countries were projected to have the most substantial growth in both age specific prevalence and age standardised prevalence from 2021 to 2050. Decomposition analysis indicated that the change in prevalence would contribute more to the increase of Parkinson's disease cases in middle Socio-demographic Index countries than in countries with other Socio-demographic Index values, except for countries with high Socio-demographic Index. This trend can be attributed to effects of risk factors brought about by foreseeable rapid progress of population ageing, industrialisation, urbanisation, and socioeconomic level over the next three decades in middle Socio-demographic Index countries. On the other hand, we projected that countries with high Socio-demographic Index will encounter the most limited future growth in both prevalence and prevalent numbers until 2050. This can be attributed, in part, to the severe population ageing, extensive industrialisation, and urbanisation already present in these countries, which will impede their potential for future change compared with countries with lower Socio-demographic Index. The increase in number of Parkinson's disease cases is expected to be highest for countries with low Socio-demographic Index, primarily owing to a combination of latent population ageing and significant population growth. Furthermore, we note that low Socio-demographic Index countries also encounter challenges such as inadequate healthcare seeking rates, suboptimal diagnosis rates, and limited epidemiological research, potentially resulting in an underestimation of the prevalence of Parkinson's disease and treatment delays in these countries. In low Socio-demographic Index countries and regions, allocation of resources is inadequate and the actual disease burden of Parkinson's disease is increased. Countries with inadequate healthcare provision are anticipated to face a formidable burden of Parkinson's disease in the future, necessitating strengthened resource allocation towards prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and research. As the Healthcare Access and Quality Index tends to be higher in countries with a higher Socio-demographic Index, countries with well developed healthcare systems should provide support and assistance to those that do not.

### Incidence and remaining lifetime risk of parkinson disease in advanced age [^15d85baf]. Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the incidence and lifetime risk (LTR) of Parkinson disease (PD) in a large cohort of men.

Background

Age is the strongest risk factor for PD, but whether its incidence continues to increase after age 80 years remains unclear.

Methods

Prospective cohort of 21,970 US male physicians aged 40–84 years at baseline who did not report PD before study entry. Participants self-reported PD on yearly follow-up questionnaires, and all deaths were confirmed. We calculated incidence rates and cumulative incidence using a modified Kaplan-Meier analysis. LTR was estimated by adjusting cumulative incidence for competing risks of death.

Results

Five hundred sixty-three cases of PD were identified over 23 years of follow-up. The crude incidence rate of PD was 121 cases/100,000 person-years. Age-specific incidence rates increased sharply beginning at age 60 years, peaked in those aged 85–89 years, and declined beginning at age 90 years. Cumulative incidence substantially overestimated the long-term risk of PD, particularly in those aged 80 years and older. Cumulative incidence was 9.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.48%-11.30%) from ages 45 to 100 years, whereas LTR for the same period was 6.7% (95% CI 6.01%-7.43%). The incidence and LTR of PD decreased with increasing exposure to smoking.

Conclusions

Our study provides evidence that the incidence of Parkinson disease (PD) in men increases through age 89 years. Whether the subsequent decline represents a true decrease in risk remains to be established. A history of smoking substantially decreased the incidence and lifetime risk of PD. Incidence studies that do not adjust for competing risks of death may overestimate the true risk of PD in the elderly.

### Global burden of early-onset Parkinson's disease, 1990–2021: results from the global burden of disease study 2021 [^02b38d69]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Early-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD) is an increasingly serious disorder, yet there is currently a scarcity of epidemiological data and reports on this disease worldwide.

Methods

By using data from the 2021 Global Burden of Disease Study, we analysed the number of incident cases, prevalent cases and years lived with disability (YLDs) for EOPD (diagnosis after the age of 20 years and before the age of 50 years) from 1990 to 2021, along with their corresponding age-standardised rates. Additionally, we calculated the average annual percent change of the age-standardised rates and analysed the negative correlation between smoking and the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) burden for EOPD.

Results

From 1990 to 2021, the incidence, prevalence and YLDs associated with EOPD have tripled globally. Most countries have seen a consistent increase in the age-standardised incidence and prevalence rates of this disease, especially those with high-middle Socio-Demographic Index scores. In 2021, smoking contributed to a 9.03% decrease in the global burden of DALYs, a decline from -14.14% in 1990.

Conclusions

EOPD is increasing at an alarming rate worldwide, necessitating the attention of global health organisations and the implementation of effective intervention measures to address this serious challenge.

### Parkinson's disease among American Indians and Alaska natives: a nationwide prevalence study [^c1aa6555]. Movement Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of Parkinson's disease (PD) among American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) people.

Methods

We analyzed records for AI/AN people between 2002 and 2009 using inpatient and outpatient visit data from the Indian Health Service. Crude and age-adjusted prevalence, using the 2000 projected US population as the standard, was determined overall and by age group, sex, period, and region.

Results

An estimated 2613 AI/AN people carried the diagnosis of PD (crude prevalence, 143.8/100,000). Prevalence increased with age through 84 years. The age-adjusted rate was 355.7 and was higher among men than women (P < .0001). Rates differed by region (P < .0001).

Conclusions

Parkinson's disease is prevalent among AI/AN people. The prevalence increases with age, varies by geographic region, and is higher among men than women. Community-based studies are needed to define incidence, examine risk factors, and determine reasons for sex and regional differences in PD among AI/AN people.

### Trends in the incidence and prevalence of Parkinson's disease in Korea: a nationwide, population-based study [^167d6a10]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The population age structure is changing worldwide with many countries facing a rapidly ageing population. As the number of older individuals within a population increases, so does the impact of chronic diseases on public health. Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common and complex neurodegenerative disorders that primarily affects older adults. PD is characterized not only by classical parkinsonian motor symptoms, but also by a range of non-motor features including autonomic, cognitive, psychiatric, and behavioral dysfunctions. Patients can survive up to a decade after diagnosis, but as PD progresses most patients experience severe physical and mental disabilities which impair their ability to live independently. In addition, the medical cost of PD is one of the highest among neurological diseases. Thus, this disease poses an increasingly high physical, emotional, social, and economic burden on patients, their families and countries. In the face of rapidly aging societies, reliable epidemiologic data are urgently needed to provide insight into the risk factors, protective factors, and natural history of PD, as well as providing important information on the burden of this disease on the population.

Despite many epidemiological studies conducted over the years, many key aspects of this disease remain unclear. The estimated incidence and prevalence of PD reported in previous studies vary to a large extent due to difference in methodologies, diagnostic criteria, case-finding strategies and a limited sample size. Temporal trend studies are particularly rare due to difficulties in the consistent identification of PD patients in a stable and generalized population over time. Previous studies have reported that the incidence of PD increased, stabilized, or slightly decreased over the years.

The lack of appropriate and detailed epidemiological data is a barrier for the projection of future disease burden and effective public health planning. Reliable estimates of the prevalence and incidence of PD are needed for more effective prevention, diagnosis, and management. Until recently, most epidemiological studies of PD were conducted in Western countries. The epidemiology of PD in Asian countries is not well understood, and the comparison of trends in the incidence of PD is limited by a small number of studies with varying diagnostic criteria. The epidemiology of PD is known to be different between the East and the West due to differences in genetics, environmental factors, and the denominator population. Therefore, further research is needed to study the incidence and prevalence of PD, particularly in Asia.

### Burden of neurological disorders across the US from 1990–2017: a global burden of disease study [^71f55913]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

According to Gooch et al, in 2011, nearly 100 million Americans were affected by at least 1 of the more than 1000 neurological disorders. This translates into an overall cost of $765 billion for the more prevalent conditions, including Alzheimer disease (AD) and other dementias, chronic low back pain, stroke, migraine, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and Parkinson disease (PD). Although accurate data on incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability from neurological disorders and their trends are important for evidence-based health care planning and resource allocation, there is a lack of national and state-level epidemiological data in the US, as well as their synthesis for use by health care planners.

Previous Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) Study articles have reported burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors among US statesand global, regional, and country-specific estimates of the burden from neurological disorders, but no estimates for a comprehensive list of neurological disorders have been reported for the US states from this study. Globally, regionally, and at the country level of analysis, the burden of all noncommunicable neurological disorders, in terms of the absolute number of people who had, remained disabled by, or died from them, has increased significantly across all countries in the world, but the burden from communicable neurological disorders, such as tetanus, meningitis, and encephalitis, has decreased from 1990 to 2016. This study provides estimates for noncommunicable and communicable neurological disorders at the state level from 1990 to 2017.

### Exposure to ambient air pollution and onset of Parkinson's disease in a large cohort study [^bf881599]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study reported that 8.5 million people globally had Parkinson's disease (PD) in 2019, with cases growing due to aging populations, showing a 145% increase between 1990 and 2016. In the United Kingdom (UK), PD prevalence for people over 20 in 2018 was 145,519, with a lifetime diagnosis risk of 2.7%. Incidence is expected to rise above 21,000 annually by 2025, alongside an 18% rise in prevalence. In the United States (US) incidence rates for individuals aged 65+ range from 108 to 212 per 100,000, and from 47 to 77 per 100,000 for those aged 45+. Understanding modifiable determinants of PD could help to mitigate this growing problem.

The etiology of PD remains unclear, with interactions between environmental and genetic factors implicated. Some emerging evidence links ambient air pollution, including particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less (PM 2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) to PD. Ambient air pollution may contribute directly through neuro-inflammation and oxidative stressor indirectly through cardiovascular health – or cerebrovascular disease. Other risk factors include dairy products, pesticides, high body mass index, diabetes, cancer, and brain injury.

### Parkinson's disease in the Western pacific region [^62f388d2]. The Lancet: Neurology (2019). High credibility.

1·8 billion people of diverse ethnicities and cultures live in the Western Pacific Region. The increasing longevity of populations in this region is a major contributor to the exponential increase in Parkinson's disease prevalence worldwide. Differences exist between Parkinson's disease in the Western Pacific Region and in Europe and North America that might provide important insights into our understanding of the disease and approaches to management. For example, some genetic factors (such as LRRK2 mutations or variants) differ, environmental exposures might play differential roles in modulating the risk of Parkinson's disease, and fewer dyskinesias are reported, with some differences in the profile of non-motor symptoms and comorbidities. Gaps in awareness of the disease and inequitable access to treatments pose challenges. Further improvements in infrastructure, clinical governance, and services, and concerted collaborative efforts in training and research, including greater representation of the Western Pacific Region in clinical trials, will improve care of patients with Parkinson's disease in this region and beyond.

### Self-reported motor and nonmotor symptoms, prodromal Parkinson's disease probability, and incident Parkinson's disease in US farmers [^2608c836]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we assessed the prevalence of major NMSs and MSs of PD in US farmers via self‐reports. We further calculated the prodromal PD probability based on the limited marker information collected in the study with and without considering self‐reported motor and olfactory impairment. Although these symptoms and the prodromal PD probability were evidently associated with incident PD, they likely have limited potential for predicting future PD diagnosis in this population of older farmers.

In the past two decades, it has been increasingly recognized that late‐onset PD has a prolonged prodromal stage, during which many nonspecific NMSs and MSs may arise at various time points. These symptoms robustly predict future PD risk and are integral to the MDS prodromal PD research criteria. The criteria estimate individuals' probability of developing PD in coming years based on their age and the presence or absence of various PD risk and prodromal markers. Using a Bayesian approach, they aim to identify individuals at a high probability of impending PD clinical diagnosis to facilitate the design and efficiency of PD interventional trials. This effort is equally valuable for epidemiological research to dissect the complex natural history of PD prodromal development and to identify contributions from genetic and nongenetic risk factors, as detailed elsewhere. Therefore, a few epidemiological studies have begun to use this and similar concepts to investigate risk factors that may contribute to early PD development. However, this line of research requires establishing the facile validity of these intermediate PD prodromal phenotypes across diverse populations.

### State-level prevalence, health service use, and spending vary widely among Medicare beneficiaries with parkinson disease [^771d47a4]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

State-level variations in disease, healthcare utilization, and spending influence healthcare planning at federal and state levels and should be examined to understand national disparities in health outcomes. This descriptive study examined state-level variations in Parkinson disease (PD) prevalence, patient characteristics, Medicare spending, out-of-pocket costs, and health service utilization using data on 27.5 million Medicare beneficiaries in the US in 2014. We found that 45.8% (n = 179,496) of Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with PD were women; 26.1% (n = 102,205) were aged 85+. The District of Columbia, New York, Illinois, Connecticut, and Florida had the highest age-, race-, and sex-adjusted prevalence of Parkinson disease among Medicare beneficiaries in the US. Women comprised over 48.5% of PD patient populations in West Virginia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas. More than 31% of the PD populations in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Hawaii, and Rhode Island were aged 85+. PD patients who were "dual-eligible"-receiving both Medicare and Medicaid benefits-also varied by state, from < 10% to > 25%. Hospitalizations varied from 304 to 653 stays per 1000 PD patients and accounted for 26.5% of the 7.9 billion United States Dollars (USD) paid by the Medicare program for healthcare services delivered to our sample. A diagnosis of PD was associated with greater healthcare use and spending. This study provides initial evidence of substantial geographic variation in PD patient characteristics, health service use, and spending. Further study is necessary to inform the development of state- and federal-level health policies that are cost-efficient and support desired outcomes for PD patients.

### Burden of neurological disorders across the US from 1990–2017: a global burden of disease study [^13913bfc]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Accurate and up-to-date estimates on incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (burden) of neurological disorders are the backbone of evidence-based health care planning and resource allocation for these disorders. It appears that no such estimates have been reported at the state level for the US.

Objective

To present burden estimates of major neurological disorders in the US states by age and sex from 1990 to 2017.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This is a systematic analysis of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 study. Data on incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of major neurological disorders were derived from the GBD 2017 study of the 48 contiguous US states, Alaska, and Hawaii. Fourteen major neurological disorders were analyzed: stroke, Alzheimer disease and other dementias, Parkinson disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease, migraine, tension-type headache, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injuries, brain and other nervous system cancers, meningitis, encephalitis, and tetanus.

Exposures

Any of the 14 listed neurological diseases.

Main Outcome and Measure

Absolute numbers in detail by age and sex and age-standardized rates (with 95% uncertainty intervals) were calculated.

Results

The 3 most burdensome neurological disorders in the US in terms of absolute number of DALYs were stroke (3.58 [95% uncertainty interval [UI], 3.25–3.92] million DALYs), Alzheimer disease and other dementias (2.55 [95% UI, 2.43–2.68] million DALYs), and migraine (2.40 [95% UI, 1.53–3.44] million DALYs). The burden of almost all neurological disorders (in terms of absolute number of incident, prevalent, and fatal cases, as well as DALYs) increased from 1990 to 2017, largely because of the aging of the population. Exceptions for this trend included traumatic brain injury incidence (-29.1% [95% UI, -32.4% to -25.8%]); spinal cord injury prevalence (-38.5% [95% UI, -43.1% to -34.0%]); meningitis prevalence (-44.8% [95% UI, -47.3% to -42.3%]), deaths (-64.4% [95% UI, -67.7% to -50.3%]), and DALYs (-66.9% [95% UI, -70.1% to -55.9%]); and encephalitis DALYs (-25.8% [95% UI, -30.7% to -5.8%]). The different metrics of age-standardized rates varied between the US states from a 1.2-fold difference for tension-type headache to 7.5-fold for tetanus; southeastern states and Arkansas had a relatively higher burden for stroke, while northern states had a relatively higher burden of multiple sclerosis and eastern states had higher rates of Parkinson disease, idiopathic epilepsy, migraine and tension-type headache, and meningitis, encephalitis, and tetanus.

Conclusions and Relevance

There is a large and increasing burden of noncommunicable neurological disorders in the US, with up to a 5-fold variation in the burden of and trends in particular neurological disorders across the US states. The information reported in this article can be used by health care professionals and policy makers at the national and state levels to advance their health care planning and resource allocation to prevent and reduce the burden of neurological disorders.

### Prevalence of Parkinson's disease across north America [^bc1e0bae]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Other variations in PD prevalence have also been observed. Using health-care claims, PD prevalence in the Canadian province of Manitoba in both rural and urban areas was higher in areas with lower average income. Rates of hospital discharges for PD across Canada have also been reported to vary significantly, suggesting that PD prevalence was higher in Western provinces. The reasons for these observed variations need to be understood. They support the need for a sampling scheme with wide geographic and socioeconomic variation if a representative sample is going to be obtained. However, our prevalence estimates are consistent enough to support the use of our meta-estimates excluding the HAAS for use in public health discussion and planning at least until more exhaustive region-specific studies within North America become available.

Previous PD prevalence estimates in North America have varied widely. The now historical study of PD prevalence in Copiah Countyascertained cases of PD through door-to-door contact, conducting screening interviews by a non-medical interviewer followed by neurological evaluation by a physician and an extensive multi-source data-gathering method in those who screened positive. Despite this careful case ascertainment, the age- and sex-standardized prevalence estimate in individuals over age 45 years, standardized to the US 2010 population is 301/100,000, smaller than our estimate of 572. The authors of the Copiah County study appropriately cautioned readers on assuming generalizability of their findings beyond the geographical boundaries of Copiah County and emphasized the usefulness of their work as providing inter-racial comparisons.

Several other regional studies of PD prevalence within North America have been published. Using the health-care administrative data sources in Ontario, Canada, the average prevalence of PD in 1992–1998 was estimated to be 363/100,000 in men and 324/100,000 in women. Direct comparison is difficult, however, because this estimate was derived using different case identification criteria, included the entire lifespan (whereas our estimates are restricted to individuals over age 45 years), and these are estimates that were adjusted to the Ontario population structure. A prevalence of 144/100,000 in the Canadian province of British Columbia was reported using drug-tracer methodology, which would only detect treated PD. The Canadian Community Health Survey found that 200/100,000 of Canadians living in private households self-reported a diagnosis of PD. Although generally lower than our estimates, variations in ascertainment methods could account for these differences.

### Projections for prevalence of Parkinson's disease and its driving factors in 195 countries and territories to 2050: modelling study of global burden of disease study 2021 [^d972ac9a]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Among the 21 Global Burden of Disease regions, we projected that East Asia would experience the highest increase in age standardised prevalence of Parkinson's disease after 2021, with the expectation of reaching the highest level in all age prevalence and age standardised prevalence by 2050. These trends not only indicate the significant impact of risk factors on the prevalence of Parkinson's disease in East Asia but also suggest the great potential for decreasing the prevalence by controlling modifiable risk factors. The largest increases in number of Parkinson's disease cases were projected in western Sub-Saharan Africa, primarily owing to the change in population ageing, along with the greatest contribution of population growth and changes in prevalence compared with other Global Burden of Disease regions. On the other hand, owing to negative population growth and a smaller contribution from population ageing, central and eastern Europe were estimated to have the smallest increase in numbers of Parkinson's disease cases. As these Global Burden of Disease regions are composed of countries with high or high-middle Socio-demographic Index, this trend is similar to the corresponding fifths.

### Incidence of dementia with lewy bodies and parkinson disease dementia [^e57cf5f0]. JAMA Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Importance

Epidemiologic data on dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson disease dementia (PDD) remain limited in the United States and worldwide. These data are essential to guide research and clinical or public health interventions.

Objective

To investigate the incidence of DLB among residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, and compare it with the incidence of PDD.

Design

The medical records linkage system of the Rochester Epidemiology Project was used to identify all persons who developed parkinsonism and, in particular, DLB or PDD from 1991 through 2005 (15 years). A movement disorders specialist reviewed the complete medical records of each suspected patient to confirm the diagnosis.

Setting

Olmsted County, Minnesota, from 1991 through 2005 (15 years).

Participants

All the residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, who gave authorization for medical record research.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Incidence of DLB and PDD.

Results

Among 542 incident cases of parkinsonism, 64 had DLB and 46 had PDD. The incidence rate of DLB was 3.5 per 100,000 person-years overall, and it increased steeply with age. The incidence of PDD was 2.5 overall and also increased steeply with age. The incidence rate of DLB and PDD combined was 5.9. Patients with DLB were younger at onset of symptoms than patients with PDD and had more hallucinations and cognitive fluctuations. Men had a higher incidence of DLB than women across the age spectrum. The pathology was consistent with the clinical diagnosis in 24 of 31 patients (77.4%) who underwent autopsy.

Conclusions and Relevance

The overall incidence rate of DLB is lower than the rate of Parkinson disease. The incidence of DLB increases steeply with age and is markedly higher in men. This men to women difference may suggest different etiologic mechanisms. Our findings may guide health care planning and prompt new studies.

### Prevalence of and indications for antipsychotic use in Parkinson's disease [^a481c891]. Movement Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence of patients with PD taking antipsychotics is unknown.

Objective

To measure the prevalence of patients with PD taking antipsychotics.

Methods

We used the medical records-linkage system of the Rochester Epidemiology Project to study the use of antipsychotic medication in all persons with Parkinson disease in Olmsted County, Minnesota on 1 January 2006.

Results

There were 296 patients with PD in Olmsted County on 1 January 2006. The overall prevalence of antipsychotic use was 9.8% (29 of 296); 95.5% (28 of 29) of the patients had dementia when initiating antipsychotics. The most frequent indication (71.4%; 20 of 28) was psychosis or behavior threatening to the patient or others.

Conclusions

The prevalence of antipsychotic use in patients with PD is lower than expected from previously reported cumulative incidences. Dementia is highly prevalent in those starting antipsychotics. Most of the patients on antipsychotics had a reasonable risk-benefit ratio for taking them. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Incidence of parkinson disease in north America [^6ff67d80]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

PD Incidence, ages 65+

Table 1 displays PD case and denominator numbers, incidence estimates for each dataset in this age group. PD incidence in persons ages 65 and older was examined over 9.3 million person-years. Study populations ranged in size from 138,806 (HAAS) to 6,866,623 (Medicare), and the number of incident PD cases identified ranged from 21 (REP) to 15,250 (Medicare).

a Standardized to the US 2010 Census population, based on 5-year age groups.

Age standardized PD incidence estimates for ages 65 and older ranged from 108 to 212 per 100, 000 person-years, from 162 to 277 among males, and from 66 to 161 among females. The Ontario Health care and Medicare program datasets produced incidence rates that were 1.5–2.0 times higher than found in among Kaiser Permanente Northern California members or the HAAS and Rochester Epidemiology Project cohorts.

PD incidence, ages 45+

Table 2 displays PD incidence estimates for ages 45+, calculated using Ontario, KPNC and REP data. As expected, including low-risk age groups reduced overall PD incidence estimates substantially from 108 to 47/100, 000 (REP), from 125 to 53/100,000 (KPNC), and from 185 to 77/100,000 (Ontario).

Age trends in PD Incidence

As examined in persons aged 65 and older, PD incidence estimates increased with age in the decades 65–74 years, 75–84 years in every study sample. However, at 85+ years, divergent incidence trends were found across datasets. Specialist confirmed cases in the HAAS, KPNC, and REP declined slightly from the previous decade (from 199 to 139 per 100,000, from 222 to 165 per 100, 000 and from 216 to 198 per 100,000 respectively), whereas the two administrative datasets (Ontario and Medicare) estimated that the incidence of PD diagnosis with concurrent anti-PD medication use continued to increase.

Sex differences in PD incidence

As shown in Fig. 1, incidence estimates were higher in males as compared to females at all ages in the datasets which allowed sex-based comparisons into the 8th decade (Ontario, Medicare and KPNC; no incident cases were reported for females ages 85+ in the REP). PD incidence among males rose first, most sharply between ages 64 and 74 in the fourstudy cohorts. In the decade of peak incidence, the male: female rate ratio varied across datasets: 1.86 (Medicare, 85+ years), 2.18 (Ontario 85+ years), 2.51 (REP, 75–84 years) 2.58 (KPNC, 75–84 years). When individuals below the age of 65 were included, a higher incidence of PD among males remained; however, the male: female sex ratio declined −4.6% (KPNC), −11.4% (Ontario), −20.8% (REP) (Table 3).

### State-level prevalence, health service use, and spending vary widely among Medicare beneficiaries with parkinson disease [^ac5fa89c]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. A waiver for informed consent was granted.

Data sources

The data sources for this study were the Medicare Beneficiary Summary File, which contains demographic, geographic, and detailed cost and health care utilization data on every Medicare beneficiary in the US, and Medicare Carrier Files, which contain ICD-9 and procedure codes for diagnoses made by CMS providers (e.g. physicians) in the inpatient and outpatient settings. The study population consisted of individuals aged 65 and above living in the 50 United States and the District of Columbia, who were continuously enrolled in Medicare parts A (which pays for inpatient care) and B (which pays outpatient setting care and provider services) during 2014. We excluded individuals who were enrolled in Health Maintenance Organizations or Medicare Advantage programs, as complete claims and health care use data may not be available for these individuals. We queried the Carrier Files for the ICD-9 codes "332" (Parkinson disease) and "332.0" (paralysis agitans), to identify qualifying Medicare beneficiaries with an active PD diagnosis in the year 2014. Beneficiaries were excluded if they also had diagnostic claims for secondary/drug-induced parkinsonism ("332.1") or other degenerative disease of the basal ganglia/atypical Parkinson syndromes ("333.0") since these diseases have a distinct pathophysiology and clinical course.

### Care access and utilization among Medicare beneficiaries living with Parkinson's disease [^fa0a9670]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study uses large-scale administrative data to measure Parkinson's disease prevalence from the most inclusive, population-based U.S. health care database to identify the size, demographic characteristics, and health care utilization patterns of the population of Medicare beneficiaries living with PD. An important strength of this study is the substantial size of the Medicare dataset, including the totality of the Fee-for-Service and Medicare Advantage populations included in a single study. The use of this dataset allows for a robust analysis of the demographic characterization of the Medicare beneficiary population living with PD, and more reliable estimates of health care utilization than previous studies that rely on data collected from hospitals and physician groups or limited solely to Medicare FFS. Additionally, past research has largely focused on the prevalence of PD in White people, males, and those living in non-rural areas. In comparison, this study analyzed a population of over 685,000 Medicare beneficiaries, reducing bias related to underrepresentation that is more prevalent in survey research and in location-specific utilization research.

Estimated trends of numbers of Parkinson's disease (PD) cases by Socio-demographic Index (SDI) fifths (top) and age groups (bottom), for both sexes combined, with 95% uncertainty intervals, 19902050. Solid lines represent values from Global Burden of Disease (1990–2021); dotted lines represent projected values (2022–50)

We projected that the all age prevalence of Parkinson's disease would increase in all countries and territories from 2021 to 2050, with 99% experiencing an increase in the number of cases and 94% experiencing an increase in age standardised prevalence (supplementary tables S4 and S5). However, we found evidence of great variation in the projected trend across countries and territories. Additionally, we forecasted the prevalence of Parkinson's disease to be highest in Spain (848, 95% uncertainty interval 728 to 1043), China (831, 724 to 1014), and Andorra (697, 588 to 873), whereas Somalia (20, 15 to 26), Niger (20, 16 to 26), and Chad (22, 19 to 30) would have the lowest. Qatar (1062%, 95% uncertainty interval 945% to 1726%) and Kuwait (425%, 389% to 549%) were projected to have the highest increase in prevalence, and Italy (3%, −25% to 34%) and Bulgaria (7%, −5% to 32%) were projected to have the lowest. Projected age standardised prevalence for 195 countries and territories in 2050 was estimated to range from 52 to 583. China was anticipated to have the highest age standardised prevalence (583, 449 to 822), and Norway was projected to have the largest increase in age standardised prevalence (292%, 273% to 311%) (fig 5; fig 6; supplementary figure S4). We estimated that approximately two thirds of global Parkinson's disease cases in 2050 would be found in the top 10 countries with the highest number of Parkinson's disease cases, with China having the highest number (10.5 (95% uncertainty interval 9.2 to 12.9) million), followed by India (2.8 (2.3 to 3.5) million) and the US (0.9 (0.8 to 1.1) million). Two countries projected to newly enter this top 10 ranking after 2021 were Indonesia and Mexico, both of which were middle Socio-demographic Index countries. Among the top 10 countries, we forecasted the largest increase in number of patients from 2021 to 2050 in Indonesia (184%, 163% to 301%), followed by Mexico (171%, 152% to 243%), and India (168%, 126% to 237%), with the smallest increases in the US (29%, 27% to 61%) and Germany (38%, 27% to 53%) (fig 7).

### The effect of air pollution on hospitalizations with Parkinson's disease among Medicare beneficiaries nationwide [^9099dacf]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related central nervous system disorder characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. About one million people in the United States (US) are affected by PD, and the prevalence of this disease is expected to rise to 1.2 million by 2030. PD posed a $51.9 billion burden in 2017, and this burden is estimated to increase to over $79 billion by 2037. Unsurprisingly, since the average age of onset is 60 years, the Medicare program (consisting mostly of persons aged ≥ 65 years) carries the brunt of the direct costs associated with PD in the US. Notably, there is persistent spatial clustering of PD diagnosis, particularly in the Midwestern and Southern parts of the US. These regions, including the Rust Belt (Midwestern and Northeastern US), have a legacy of heavy industrial activity and continue to be areas with the highest atmospheric pollution levels in the country. Thus, understanding whether air pollution may be a risk factor for PD development and hospitalization among this subgroup of the population, both of which contribute to the direct costs shouldered by Medicare, is pertinent for resource allocation, targeted interventions, preventative policy, and healthcare planning.

### Time trends in the incidence of parkinson disease… [^97112e2b]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Question Is the incidence of parkinsonism and Parkinson disease changing over time. Findings In this study in Olmsted County, Minnesota, the incidence of both parkinsonism and Parkinson disease increased over 30 years, particularly in men 70 years old and older. In addition, an increased risk of Parkinson disease was observed in men born in the 1920 cohort compared with other birth cohorts. on the exclusion of parkinsonism. 11 In general, the agreement on the year of onset of parkinsonism was also high and for PD. In addition, we investigated changes in incidence rates separately for men and women in 2 broad age classes: younger than 70 years and 70 years and older. Incidence rates were directly standardized by age to the total US population from the 1990 decennial census when overall rates were compared.
23.

Figure 1 shows incidence rates age-standardized to the total 1990 US population estimated using single calendar year data points and negative binomial regression in men and women separately for parkinsonism and for PD. The incidence rates for parkinsonism of all types and for PD were higher in men than in women across all 3 decades. However, in the past 25 years, the gap between men and women has narrowed. Between 1965 and 2009, the frequency declined from 51. 9% to
23. 5% in men and from 33. 9% to
17. 9% in women. 30 The decline in smoking rates in men may explain in part the increasing incidence of parkinsonism.

Finally, the decision to focus on data from 2019 stemmed from a desire to concentrate on health care consumption patterns in a single calendar year prior to the short-term disruption in care seeking and care access patterns brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The year 2019 was chosen because it was the most current year of available Medicare Advantage data at the time the research was conducted. Future studies should examine additional years of data with a focus on time since PD diagnosis, along with medication claims and usage, to ascertain more detail about the PD population in Medicare. Nevertheless, given these limitations, these analyses reveal important findings about the utilization of healthcare services by the PD population within Medicare and provides a baseline to guide more nuanced estimates of PD prevalence as they become available.

### Burden of illness in Parkinson's disease [^421eb61a]. Movement Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

This study quantifies direct medical care costs for individual patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and projects total national costs of PD. Anonymous, patient-level data on health care utilization and cost were obtained from Medstat's MarketScan Research Databases. Patients were selected for study if they had either two instances of a diagnosis of PD or one diagnosis and two or more prescriptions for PD-related medication. A control group of persons without PD was selected for comparison. Total annual health care utilization and costs were calculated for both PD patients and controls. A total of 20,016 patients with PD were identified and followed up for an average of 853 days. The mean age of the patients was 73.6 years, and 51.2% were women. Total annual direct costs were 23,101 US Dollars (SD 27,529) per patient with PD versus 11,247 US Dollars (SD 16,486) for controls. The regression-adjusted incremental direct cost of PD versus control was 10,349 US Dollars (95% confidence interval, 9,053, 11,645). Adding 25,326 US Dollars in indirect costs, and multiplying by 645,000 cases of PD in the United States, the total cost to the nation is projected to be 23 billion US Dollars annually. This estimate is higher than most previous studies, with important implications for health care delivery systems worldwide.

### Racial differences in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease [^0f51b07b]. Movement Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this cohort study was to determine the incidence of Parkinson's disease (PD) and the effects of race/ethnicity, other demographic characteristics, geography, and healthcare utilization on probability of diagnosis. The authors used the Pennsylvania state Medicaid claims dataset from 1999 to 2003 to identify newly diagnosed cases of PD among the 182,271 Medicaid enrolled adults age 40–65; 319 incident cases of PD were identified. The 4-year cumulative incidence of PD was 45 per 100,000; 54 per 100,000 among whites, 23 per 100,000 among African-Americans and 40 per 100,000 among Latinos (P < 0.0001), corresponding to a relative risk (RR) of PD of 0.43 for African-Americans (P < 0.0001) compared with whites. After adjusting for age, sex, geography, reason for Medicaid eligibility, and average number of visits, African-Americans were still half as likely to be diagnosed with PD as whites (RR 0.45, P < 0.0001). Older age, more healthcare visits and Medicaid eligibility because of income alone also were significantly associated with PD diagnosis, while male sex was not. Observed racial differences in incidence of PD are not explained by differences in age, sex, income, insurance or healthcare utilization but still may be explained by biological differences or other factors such as education or aging beliefs. Better understanding of the complex biological and social determinants of these disparities is critical to improve PD care.
