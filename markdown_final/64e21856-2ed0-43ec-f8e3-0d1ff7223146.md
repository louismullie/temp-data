## Question

What are the most effective treatments for lactational mastitis in breastfeeding women?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most effective treatments for lactational mastitis in breastfeeding women. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical spectrum and pathophysiology to anchor treatment choices. Then, I should verify the universal first-line management principles. Next, I will examine when and how to escalate to antibiotics, including culture strategy and agents. After that, I need to review supportive and adjunctive therapies, including probiotics, ultrasound, and lecithin. Finally, I will consider special scenarios like abscess, recurrent mastitis, and prevention, and close with a concise, prioritized recommendation summary with caveats about evidence quality.

> Let me first confirm the clinical framework. Lactational mastitis spans a spectrum from ductal narrowing and inflammatory mastitis to bacterial mastitis and abscess, with milk stasis, hyperlactation, and mammary dysbiosis as key drivers; importantly, many cases are inflammatory rather than infectious, so I need to avoid reflex antibiotics and tailor therapy to the stage and severity [^dedb25ac] [^590b2d2d].

> I will now examine universal first-line management. Wait, let me verify the core steps: continue breastfeeding or milk removal on demand (not aiming to "empty"), use ice and NSAIDs for pain and edema, and reassess within 24–48 hours; this approach aligns with ABM 2022 and contemporary reviews, and it addresses the inflammatory component while preserving milk transfer and microbiome integrity [^1f50b621] [^43c5fe5b] [^dbf05a02].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibiotics. I should confirm when they are indicated: reserve antibiotics for suspected or confirmed bacterial mastitis, typically when there is no improvement after 24–48 hours of conservative care, or when there are signs of systemic infection or purulence; this is a shift from older paradigms and is supported by ABM 2022 and AAFP 2024, with Cochrane reviews historically calling for better RCTs to clarify benefit [^54143b48] [^dbf05a02] [^a98b61b8].

> Next, I should review antibiotic selection and duration. Let me think about first-line agents: dicloxacillin or flucloxacillin 500 mg four times daily for 10–14 days, or cephalexin 500 mg four times daily for 10–14 days; if MRSA is suspected or confirmed, use clindamycin 300 mg four times daily or TMP-SMX double-strength twice daily, with caution in infants under 30 days or with G6PD deficiency; I need to ensure I align with ABM dosing and safety guidance and remember that most patients can be treated as outpatients unless severely ill [^b93cc21b] [^e49af5a8] [^36c1291f].

> I should double-check the culture strategy. If there is no improvement after 48 hours of appropriate therapy, or in recurrent cases, obtain a milk culture to identify resistant organisms like MRSA or less common pathogens; this is especially important in healthcare workers, those with recurrent infections, or when feeding immunocompromised infants, and it helps avoid empiric escalation that could worsen dysbiosis [^59253dfc] [^770538f3].

> Let me consider supportive and adjunctive therapies. Ice and NSAIDs are foundational; therapeutic ultrasound may reduce inflammation and edema and can be used daily until relief, though evidence quality varies; lecithin 5–10 g daily may reduce ductal inflammation and emulsify milk; I should confirm that these are conditional recommendations with variable evidence strength [^1f50b621] [^f6cb73cc] [^3983cdf5].

> But wait, what about probiotics. I need to check the strength of evidence: ABM notes mixed data and does not make a strong recommendation; however, some trials suggest L. fermentum or L. salivarius may be effective for treatment or prevention, with one RCT showing higher recovery and lower recurrence versus antibiotics; given potential microbiome benefits and low risk, probiotics can be considered, especially in recurrent cases, but I should frame this as optional and strain-specific [^87508c39] [^6a34c809] [^dc0a7fa0].

> I will now examine abscess management. Source control is essential: ultrasound-guided needle aspiration with culture is preferred initially, with repeat aspirations or drain placement as needed; avoid suction devices on lactating breasts; continue breastfeeding from the affected breast unless drainage contacts the infant's mouth; antibiotic duration is commonly 10–14 days, tailored to clinical response; I should confirm that these steps align with ABM and that breastfeeding can safely continue with appropriate precautions [^3a8982a8] [^9f4b940f] [^b4383507].

> Next, I should review recurrent mastitis. Let me verify the approach: evaluate for hyperlactation, excessive pumping, aggressive massage, and other risk factors; obtain milk culture to distinguish true recurrence from persistent or resistant infection; consider daily probiotics with L. fermentum or L. salivarius for prevention; and if recurrences localize to the same quadrant, image to exclude mass or granulomatous mastitis; this comprehensive strategy reduces recurrence and addresses root causes [^770538f3] [^acefd2b6] [^a3a03342].

> I need to ensure prevention is addressed. Advise on-demand feeding rather than scheduled "emptying", minimize pumping unless medically indicated, avoid aggressive breast massage, and use a properly fitting supportive bra; for engorgement, hand expression to comfort is preferred over pumping; these behavioral measures reduce milk stasis and dysbiosis and are emphasized in ABM 2022 and AAFP 2024 [^dc0c4004] [^20caa300] [^dbf05a02].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations. In mothers with HIV, maintain ART suppression, promptly treat mastitis and nipple trauma, and coordinate weaning plans if viral load rises; good breast care to avoid engorgement and mastitis is explicitly recommended, underscoring that mastitis management is integral to reducing transmission risk during breastfeeding [^0bad462d] [^1f54e9eb].

> Let me reconsider the overall hierarchy to ensure internal consistency. First-line for all suspected mastitis is conservative care with continued breastfeeding or milk removal, ice, NSAIDs, and close follow-up; escalate to antibiotics only for bacterial mastitis or lack of improvement, using narrow-spectrum agents and culture-guided adjustments; add adjuncts like ultrasound or lecithin selectively; consider strain-specific probiotics in recurrent disease; and manage abscesses with aspiration and continued breastfeeding when safe; this staged approach balances efficacy, safety, and stewardship while aligning with the best available guidance [^1f50b621] [^54143b48] [^dbf05a02].

---

The most effective treatments for lactational mastitis are **conservative management** (frequent, effective milk removal; ice; NSAIDs) [^1f50b621] for most cases, with **antibiotics reserved for bacterial mastitis** or if there is no improvement within 48–72 hours [^54143b48] [^59253dfc]. Antibiotics should be **narrow-spectrum** (dicloxacillin, cephalexin, or clindamycin) [^b93cc21b] and tailored to local resistance patterns; milk culture is indicated for refractory or recurrent cases [^59253dfc]. Probiotics (L. fermentum or L. salivarius) may be considered for recurrent mastitis, but evidence is limited [^87508c39] [^dc0a7fa0]. Hospitalization and IV antibiotics are rarely needed unless there is sepsis or inability to tolerate oral therapy [^36c1291f]. Continued breastfeeding or milk expression is safe and recommended [^207b2899] [^5e18e9a7].

---

## Conservative management

Conservative management is **first-line** for most cases of lactational mastitis, including inflammatory and mild bacterial cases [^dbf05a02].

- **Frequent and effective milk removal**: Continue breastfeeding or expressing milk to prevent milk stasis, which is a key driver of mastitis [^058566c1] [^590b2d2d].

- **Ice application**: Apply ice packs to the affected breast for 15–20 minutes every 1–2 hours to reduce inflammation, edema, and pain [^1f50b621].

- **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**: Ibuprofen or naproxen provide analgesia and reduce inflammation [^1f50b621].

- **Supportive measures**: Rest, hydration, and a well-fitting bra support recovery [^20caa300].

---

## Antibiotic therapy

Antibiotics are indicated for **bacterial mastitis** or when there is no improvement after 48–72 hours of conservative therapy [^54143b48] [^59253dfc].

- **First-line antibiotics**: Dicloxacillin or flucloxacillin 500 mg orally four times daily for 10–14 days; cephalexin 500 mg orally four times daily for 10–14 days is an alternative [^b93cc21b].

- **Second-line antibiotics**: Clindamycin 300 mg orally four times daily for 10–14 days, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole double-strength orally twice daily for 10–14 days (avoid in infants with G6PD deficiency or premature infants) [^b93cc21b].

- **Milk culture**: Obtain if there is no improvement after 48 hours of antibiotics, recurrent mastitis, or suspicion of resistant organisms (e.g. MRSA) [^59253dfc] [^770538f3].

---

## Adjunctive therapies

Adjunctive therapies may be considered in **specific scenarios**, though evidence varies:

- **Probiotics**: Lactobacillus fermentum or Lactobacillus salivarius may reduce recurrence in chronic or recurrent mastitis; evidence is limited and strain-specific [^87508c39] [^dc0a7fa0].

- **Therapeutic ultrasound**: May reduce inflammation and edema; evidence is limited and not universally available [^f6cb73cc].

- **Lecithin**: 5–10 g daily may reduce ductal inflammation and emulsify milk; evidence is limited [^1f50b621].

---

## Hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics

Hospitalization and IV antibiotics are reserved for **severe cases**, such as:

- **Sepsis or systemic instability**: Severe infection, hemodynamic instability, or inability to tolerate oral medications [^36c1291f].

- **Resistant organisms**: Known or suspected multidrug-resistant organisms (e.g. MRSA) [^e49af5a8].

- **Abscess formation**: Requires surgical drainage in addition to antibiotics [^3a8982a8].

---

## Continued breastfeeding

Continued breastfeeding or milk expression is **safe and recommended** during mastitis treatment, including when antibiotics are used [^207b2899] [^5e18e9a7]. Milk from the affected breast is safe for the infant unless there is purulent drainage or the mother is on contraindicated medications [^b4383507].

---

## Summary of treatment effectiveness

| **Treatment modality** | **Effectiveness** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| Conservative management | Highly effective | First-line for most cases |
| Antibiotics | Highly effective | Bacterial mastitis or no improvement after 48–72 hours |
| Probiotics | Moderately effective | Recurrent mastitis |
| Therapeutic ultrasound | Limited evidence | Adjunctive therapy |
| Hospitalization/IV antibiotics | Reserved | Severe cases |

---

Conservative management is **first-line** for most cases of lactational mastitis, with antibiotics reserved for bacterial infection or lack of improvement. Continued breastfeeding or milk expression is safe and recommended. Hospitalization and IV antibiotics are reserved for severe cases.

## References

### Antibiotics for mastitis in breastfeeding women [^a98b61b8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Mastitis can be caused by ineffective positioning of the baby at the breast or restricted feeding. Infective mastitis is commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The prevalence of mastitis in breastfeeding women may reach 33%. Effective milk removal, pain medication and antibiotic therapy have been the mainstays of treatment.

Objectives

This review aims to examine the effectiveness of antibiotic therapies in relieving symptoms for breastfeeding women with mastitis with or without laboratory investigation.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2012), contacted investigators and other content experts known to us for unpublished trials and scanned the reference lists of retrieved articles.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing the effectiveness of various types of antibiotic therapies or antibiotic therapy versus alternative therapies for the treatment of mastitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. When in dispute, we consulted a third author.

Main Results

Two trials met the inclusion criteria. One small trial (n = 25) compared amoxicillin with cephradine and found no significant difference between the two antibiotics in terms of symptom relief and abscess formation. Another, older study compared breast emptying alone as 'supportive therapy' versus antibiotic therapy plus supportive therapy, and no therapy. The findings of the latter study suggested faster clearance of symptoms for women using antibiotics, although the study design was problematic.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to confirm or refute the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy for the treatment of lactational mastitis. There is an urgent need to conduct high-quality, double-blinded RCTs to determine whether antibiotics should be used in this common postpartum condition.

### Interventions for preventing mastitis after childbirth [^cb08af06]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the health benefits of breastfeeding, initiation and duration rates continue to fall short of international guidelines. Many factors influence a woman's decision to wean; the main reason cited for weaning is associated with lactation complications, such as mastitis.

Objectives

To assess the effects of preventive strategies for mastitis and the subsequent effect on breastfeeding duration.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (November 2009), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1950 to November 2009), EMBASE (1974 to November 2009), CINAHL (1981 to November 2009), MIDIRS (1971 to November 2009), IPA (1970 to November 2009), AMED (1985 to November 2009) and LILACS (1982 to November 2009).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of interventions for preventing mastitis in postpartum breastfeeding women.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently identified relevant studies and assessed the trial quality. We contacted trial authors for missing data and information as appropriate.

Main Results

We included five trials (involving 960 women). In three trials of 471 women, we found no significant differences in the incidence of mastitis between use of antibiotics and no antibiotics (risk ratio (RR) 0.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 1.61; or in one trial of 99 women comparing two doses (RR 0.38; 95% CI 0.02 to 9.18). We found no significant differences for mastitis in three trials of specialist breastfeeding education with usual care (one trial); anti-secretory factor cereal (one trial); and mupirocin, fusidic acid ointment or breastfeeding advice (one trial). Generally we found no differences in any of the trials for breastfeeding initiation or duration; or symptoms of mastitis.

Authors' Conclusions

There was insufficient evidence to show effectiveness of any of the interventions, including breastfeeding education, pharmacological treatments and alternative therapies, regarding the occurrence of mastitis or breastfeeding exclusivity and duration. While studies reported the incidence of mastitis, they all used different interventions. Caution needs to be applied when considering the findings of this review as the conclusion is based on studies, often with small sample sizes. An urgent need for further adequately powered research is needed into this area to conclusively determine the effectiveness of these interventions.

Recommendations framework — For each recommendation, the quality of evidence (levels of evidence 1, 2, and 3) and the strength of recommendation (A, B, and C) are noted as defined by the strength of recommendation taxonomy criteria. Management of mastitis spectrum disorders includes general strategies that apply to the entire spectrum, as well as condition-specific interventions. Prompt and effective treatment will halt progression in the spectrum. Many of these measures provide not only treatment, but prevention as well.

### Study protocol: evaluation of the probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 for the prevention of mastitis in breastfeeding women: a randomised controlled trial [^808998c6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Mastitis and accompanying pain have been associated with the cessation of breastfeeding. Mastitis is an inflammatory condition of the breast and may be a result of decreased immunity and a lowered resistance to infection. Mastitis affects up to one in five breastfeeding women with most episodes occurring in the first 6–8 weeks postpartum. Antibiotics are often used in the treatment of mastitis, but have not been popular or proven effective as a preventative agent. The WHO has highlighted significant concerns relating to adverse harms of antibiotic use with the production of antibiotic-resistant strains of disease organisms. Increasing research suggests that specific probiotic bacteria possess significant anti-inflammatory properties and supports their potential use as immunomodulatory agents. While animal studies have shown promising results in the use of probiotics for preventing mastitis, their use in human trials has had limited investigation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of oral probiotics for the prevention of mastitis in breastfeeding women.

Methods

APProve (CAn Probiotics ImProve Breastfeeding Outcomes?) is a double-blind randomised controlled trial designed to assess outcomes between breastfeeding women ingesting a probiotic versus a placebo daily for 8 weeks following birth. A total of 600 women (300 to each arm) who intend to breastfeed will be randomised after the birth of a term, healthy infant. Daily and weekly surveys for 8 weeks and follow-up surveys at 2, 6 and 12 months after birth will assess the primary outcome of mastitis in the first 8 weeks following birth as well as secondary maternal outcomes of breastfeeding duration (total/partial), antibiotic use, maternal health and well-being, and treatment compliance; and infant outcomes including gastroenteritis, infant health and well-being and growth and development. The acceptability and compliance using a novel mobile phone application system will also be evaluated.

Discussion

There is an urgent need to explore safe and effective alternatives for preventing mastitis in breastfeeding women. This trial seeks to provide evidence for such an alternative in the form of probiotics, which may also increase breastfeeding duration, providing long-term health, cognitive and developmental benefits for children. Decreased antibiotic usage also benefits the community and health system.

### Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine clinical protocol # 36: the mastitis spectrum, revised 2022 [^c6e065ca]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

A central goal of the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine is the development of clinical protocols for managing common medical problems that may impact breastfeeding success. These protocols serve only as guidelines for the care of breastfeeding mothers and infants and do not delineate an exclusive course of treatment or serve as standards of medical care. Variations in treatment may be appropriate according to the needs of an individual patient. The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine recognizes that not all lactating individuals identify as women. Using gender-inclusive language, however, is not possible in all languages and all countries and for all readers. The position of the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine (https://doi.org/10.1089/bfm.2021.29188.abm) is to interpret clinical protocols within the framework of inclusivity of all breastfeeding, chestfeeding, and human milk-feeding individuals.

### Study protocol: evaluation of the probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 for the prevention of mastitis in breastfeeding women: a randomised controlled trial [^9c16170f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Breastfeeding has been consistently shown to be protective against a broad range of immediate and long term infant and maternal health outcomes. International guidelines recommend exclusive breastfeeding for all babies in the first 6 months of life as it provides the best nutritional start for infants and promotes their healthy growth and development. Given the positive benefits of breastfeeding, it is of concern that the 2010 Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Health Survey reported less than 15% of women exclusively breastfeeding at 5 months of age, despite a 96% initiation rate at birth. These findings suggest that more resources and research are required to identify and treat the underlying causes of breastfeeding cessation in order to extend the overall duration and improve long term maternal and child health outcomes.

Mastitis and the pain associated with the condition have been shown to be associated with the cessation of breastfeeding. The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines mastitis as an inflammatory condition of the breast, which may or may not be accompanied by infection. It occurs in 15–21% of breastfeeding mothers in Australia. Most episodes occur in the first 6–8 weeks postpartum but can occur at any time during breastfeeding. Almost one-third of women experience a recurrent episode, and up to 3% of women with mastitis develop a breast abscess, often necessitating hospitalisation.

Little is known about the epidemiology and pathogenesis of this common condition. Though not well described, the risk factors appear to be associated with milk stasis, nipple damage and maternal fatigue. Cracked nipples may facilitate entrance of microorganisms through the skin, and incomplete emptying of the breasts may result in milk stasis which provides a susceptible and receptive culture media for microorganisms. Decreased immunity and a lowered resistance to infection may be a result of maternal fatigue. Other risk factors include a history of mastitis with a previous child, using an antifungal nipple cream and using a manual breast pump.

Current management of mastitis generally centers on symptom management (i.e. applying hot/cold compresses, analgesics), encouragement of the continuation of breastfeeding (including fully emptying the affected breast, feeding more frequently, and changing feeding positions often), and antibiotic therapy. A Cochrane review examining the effectiveness of antibiotic therapies in treating symptoms of mastitis in breastfeeding women showed a trend towards a benefit of treatment, but only 2 trials were included and were of limited quality, with one conducted over 30 years ago. As such, authors deduced there was insufficient evidence to confirm or refute the use of antibiotics in the treatment of lactational mastitis.

### Study protocol: evaluation of the probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 for the prevention of mastitis in breastfeeding women: a randomised controlled trial [^a5d95efc]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Interventions that support prolonging breastfeeding duration have the potential to improve human health. Mastitis is a painful and debilitating complication of breastfeeding which affects 1 in 5 breastfeeding mothers. It is associated with early cessation of breastfeeding and, if severe, may lead to unwarranted hospital admissions for treatment of abscess often requiring treatment with antibiotics. At a time when we are experiencing the negative effects of antibiotic overuse, there is an urgent need to explore safe and effective alternatives for preventing infections such as mastitis in lactating women. This trial seeks to provide evidence for such an alternative in the form of probiotics, which may increase breastfeeding duration and potentially provide long-term health, cognitive and developmental benefits for children, as well as decrease antibiotic usage with benefits to the community and health system.

Regarding medical management for lactational mastitis, more specifically with respect to supportive care, ABM 2022 guidelines recommend to reassure patients that many mastitis symptoms will resolve with conservative care and psychosocial support. Support patients in continuation of breastfeeding and ascertain what resources they may need to prevent early weaning.

### Interventions for treating painful nipples among breastfeeding women [^9a4669af]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Leading health authorities all recommend exclusive breastfeeding to six months' postpartum. While most women initiate breastfeeding, many discontinue due to difficulties encountered rather than maternal choice. One common breastfeeding difficulty is painful nipples. Research has identified poor infant positioning or latch as a common cause of painful nipples. While many different interventions designed to reduce nipple pain in breastfeeding women have been evaluated, it is unclear which intervention is the most effective treatment. An understanding of nipple pain and treatment options are needed to improve breastfeeding duration and exclusivity rates and to address systematically one of the most frequent difficulties encountered by breastfeeding women.

Objectives

To assess the effects of all interventions in the resolution or reduction of nipple pain and the impact of the interventions on other outcomes such as nipple trauma, nipple infections, breast mastitis, breastfeeding duration, breastfeeding exclusivity, and maternal satisfaction.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2014) and scanned secondary references.

Selection Criteria

All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials designed to evaluate any intervention for treating nipple pain among breastfeeding women. Trials using a cluster-randomised design were eligible for inclusion. Cross-over trials were not eligible for inclusion. The following interventions were eligible for inclusion compared with each other or usual care (i.e. education only): pharmacological (e.g. antifungal creams); non-pharmacological topical treatments (e.g. lanolin); dressings (e.g. hydrogel dressings); nipple protection devices (e.g. breast shells), phototherapy, and expressed breast milk. Nipple pain in women who are feeding with expressed breast milk (i.e. women of infants in neonatal units) is associated with other methods of removing milk from the mother's breast such as manual expression and various types of breast pumps. Nipple pain and subsequent treatment is different in this unique maternal population and thus we excluded women solely feeding with expressed breast milk from this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data, evaluated methodological quality, and checked data for accuracy. We sought additional information from several trial researchers.

Main Results

We included four trials of good methodological quality involving 656 women in the review. The four included trials evaluated five different interventions including glycerine pads, lanolin with breast shells, lanolin alone, expressed breast milk, and an all-purpose nipple ointment. All studies included education to position the infant at the breast correctly as part of routine postpartum care to both treatment and control groups. Pooled data existed only for the comparison of lanolin versus usual care. We did not pool data for other outcomes due to either heterogeneity in outcome measures or differing interventions. There was no evidence that glycerine gel dressings or breast shells with lanolin significantly improved nipple pain. One trial found no clear differences in nipple pain (at one to three days, four to five days, or six to seven days' post-treatment) between women who applied lanolin or nothing to their nipples. In contrast, the same trial found that women who applied expressed breast milk had significantly lower perceptions of nipple pain following four to five days of treatment than women who applied lanolin. However, this beneficial effect was not maintained after six to seven days of treatment. There were no group differences in nipple pain perceptions at any assessment between women who applied expressed breast milk and women who applied nothing. Women who applied an "all-purpose nipple ointment", in comparison to women who applied lanolin, had no improvement in nipple pain after seven days of treatment. There was insufficient evidence that glycerine gel dressings, lanolin with breast shells, lanolin alone, expressed breast milk, or all-purpose nipple ointment improved maternal perceptions of nipple pain. Overall, there was insufficient evidence to recommend any intervention for the treatment of nipple pain. However, one important finding was that regardless of the treatment used, for most women nipple pain reduced to mild levels after approximately seven to 10 days' postpartum. The provision of anticipatory guidance regarding usual time to pain reduction may be a useful strategy in assisting women to continue to breastfeed and to do so exclusively. The overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcome of nipple pain as assessed using GRADE was of low quality, mainly because single studies with few participants contributed data for analysis.

Authors' Conclusions

There was insufficient evidence that glycerine gel dressings, breast shells with lanolin, lanolin alone, or the all-purpose nipple ointment significantly improved maternal perceptions of nipple pain. The results from these four trials of good methodological quality suggested that applying nothing or just expressed breast milk may be equally or more beneficial in the short-term experience of nipple pain than the application of an ointment such as lanolin. The quality of the evidence for this review did not lead to robust conclusions regarding the objectives assessed. We included only four trials, incorporating 656 women, in the review and all four trials compared varying interventions, participants, study outcome measures, and standards of usual care. The methodological quality of the included studies was good but the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcome of nipple pain was of low quality, mainly because single studies with few participants contributed data for analysis.

### Study protocol: evaluation of the probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 for the prevention of mastitis in breastfeeding women: a randomised controlled trial [^d3074574]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Optimal management for the prevention of mastitis is not known. A Cochrane review specifically aimed to assess the effects of preventative strategies for mastitis and the subsequent effect on breastfeeding duration also showed insufficient evidence as to the effectiveness of a range of interventions. These interventions included education on breastfeeding, changes in breastfeeding habits, hot/cold packs, relaxation techniques, and use of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent recurrence. Only three trials examining the effect of antibiotics were included and although no significant difference in the incidence of mastitis was found, a trend towards a reduced effect was reported (risk ratio (RR) 0.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 1.61). When one of the trials amongst HIV infected women was excluded, the two remaining studies reported a 67% and 76% reduction in mastitis with antibiotic prophylaxis, respectively. However, all trials were inadequately powered or prematurely stopped due to concerns related to the adverse harms of antibiotic use, issues related to side effects, patient compliance, and attitudes. The review concluded that the use of antibiotics in the absence of clear indications resulted in no benefit and could lead to harm, not just for the participants, but in the production of antibiotic-resistant strains of the organisms. Authors of the Cochrane review recommended future studies should consider implementation of strategies to improve adherence such as extended consultation time with participants when recruiting participants to explain and reinforce instruction; designing interventions such as tailoring drug regimens to patient lifestyle; frequent follow up when initialising or changing treatment regimes; and the use of reminder calls and alerts to keep participants focused.

Statistical analyses

The analysis and reporting of the results will follow the CONSORT guidelines. Primary and secondary outcomes will be analysed using an intention-to-treat approach, which includes all losses-to follow-up, non-compliances or withdrawals. Baseline characteristics will be compared between allocated treatment groups using frequencies and descriptive statistics. The principal analysis will use an unadjusted Chi-Square test to compare the incidence of mastitis between the two groups. The corresponding unadjusted relative risk with 95% confidence interval will also be calculated. Further analysis of the primary outcome will use multivariable logistic regression to examine the effect of adjusting for any imbalances at baseline or important predictors of mastitis (e.g. previous history of mastitis, antibiotic use, cracked nipples, or duration of breastfeeding). Additional unadjusted and adjusted analyses of all secondary outcomes will be performed using measures and multivariable models appropriate for the outcome. An analysis of women compliant with treatment (per protocol) will also be performed to assess the robustness of the primary findings. For all analyses, the number of cases with complete data and those with missing values will be reported. If necessary, reason for and type of missing data will be assessed to determine whether multiple imputation, sensitivity analysis or other approaches ("best" and "worst" case scenario, last value carried forward) will be required. Analyses will be performed using SPSS Version 24 (IBM SPSS Statistics, 2016 IBM Corporation, Chicago, IL) by an analyst not involved in any data collection and blinded to treatment allocation.

To assess the impact of the APP, the rate of primary and secondary study outcomes will be compared between the main study group and small sub-sample. Compliance rates in the ingestion of the intervention, and completeness and acceptability of data collected during daily and weekly follow-up will also be examined between the two study groups.

This protocol has been formatted according to the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) guidelines (Additional file 1).

### Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine clinical protocol # 36: the mastitis spectrum, revised 2022 [^dedb25ac]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine Clinical Protocol #36 — the mastitis spectrum — states that scientific evidence demonstrates that mastitis "encompasses a spectrum of conditions resulting from ductal inflammation and stromal edema", and that the "pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of each condition in the mastitis spectrum (ductal narrowing, inflammatory mastitis, bacterial mastitis, phlegmon, abscess, galactocele, and subacute mastitis) will be discussed hereunder", with "Early postpartum engorgement, a distinct condition" also reviewed. It describes progression whereby "If ductal narrowing and alveolar congestion are worsened by overstimulation of milk production, then inflammatory mastitis can develop, and acute bacterial mastitis may follow", which "can progress to phlegmon or abscess, particularly in the setting of tissue trauma from aggressive breast massage", and notes that "Galactoceles, which can result from unresolved hyperlactation, can become infected" and "Subacute mastitis occurs in the setting of chronic mammary dysbiosis, with bacterial biofilms narrowing ductal lumens". Protocol scope statements emphasize that "These protocols serve only as guidelines for the care of breastfeeding mothers and infants and do not delineate an exclusive course of treatment or serve as standards of medical care", and that "Variations in treatment may be appropriate according to the needs of an individual patient". Inclusivity language specifies that "The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine recognizes that not all lactating individuals identify as women" and that the position is "to interpret clinical protocols within the framework of inclusivity of all breastfeeding, chestfeeding, and human milk-feeding individuals". The document also states that it "now replaces ABM Protocols #4, Mastitis, and #20, Engorgement, which will both be retired; ABM Protocols #32 (Management of Hyperlactation) and #35 (Supporting Breastfeeding During Maternal or Child Hospitalization) may serve as useful adjuncts to this protocol".

### Study protocol: evaluation of the probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 for the prevention of mastitis in breastfeeding women: a randomised controlled trial [^b35b025f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

The underlying biological pathogenesis of mastitis is important when considering management options. Mastitis is characterised by the presence of the main aetiological agents of infection, staphylococci and streptococcal organisms. The mastitis causing strains, mainly staphylococcus aureus and streptocococcus epidermidis usually display two common properties; resistance to antibiotics and a high ability to form biofilms, which may explain their resistance to a wide range of antibiotic therapies and resultant recurrence of disease. A recent WHO report outlines the growing public health concern related to antimicrobial resistance. The report stresses that resistance of common bacteria to antimicrobial drugs has reached alarming levels, with available options for treating infections becoming increasingly ineffective. Further, authors stress the importance of actively seeking safe and effective alternatives to antibiotics.

Probiotics, with their increasing recognition and use in recent years, may provide one such alternative. Probiotics are live microorganisms that when administered in adequate amounts are thought to confer a beneficial effect to the host. Research indicates that specific probiotic bacteria possess significant anti-inflammatory properties comparable to a therapeutic pharmaceutical agent and supports their potential use as immunomodulatory agents. Given the gut microbiota is a critical stimulus for the adequate maturation and function of the immune system, oral administration of probiotics to women during the early postnatal period to modulate microbiota composition is thought to provide an effective dietary strategy to reduce the risk of infection and disease.

### Risk factors, symptoms, and treatment of lactational mastitis [^590b2d2d]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on lactational mastitis:

- **Definition**: Lactational mastitis is a spectrum of inflammatory conditions of the breast in breastfeeding women, characterized by milk stasis, hyperlactation, and/or mammary dysbiosis, which can lead to infection.
- **Pathophysiology**: The primary factor in the pathophysiology of lactational mastitis is milk stasis due poor milk drainage or ductal obstruction, which triggers an inflammatory response. Disruption of the milk microbiome is another contributing factor. Acute bacterial mastitis is often caused by Staphylococcus and Streptococcus strains.
- **Epidemiology**: Lactational mastitis is estimated to occur in 2–33% of breastfeeding women.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for lactational mastitis include nipple trauma or fissures, plugged milk ducts, wearing a tight bra, deep breast massage, hyperlactation, frequent breast pumping, abrupt weaning, history of mastitis in previous pregnancies, as well as maternal obesity and smoking.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course of lactational mastitis typically begins with localized breast pain, tenderness, erythema, and warmth, progressing to systemic symptoms if untreated.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis for lactational mastitis is generally good with appropriate management. Most cases resolve within 48–72 hours of initiating treatment. However, recurrence is possible, particularly in the presence of underlying risk factors.

### Study protocol: evaluation of the probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 for the prevention of mastitis in breastfeeding women: a randomised controlled trial [^5451ea87]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

The use of probiotic bacteria during pregnancy and postpartum has also been proposed as a means of modulating maternal infection or inflammatory processes and to support immune development in the infant. Breastfed infants of mothers who consumed specific probiotics in the early postpartum period reported fewer gastrointestinal symptoms, while risk of atopic eczema, allergy and asthma was shown to confer some benefit during the first 2 years of life by some studies, but not in others. Further studies with longer follow-up and amongst specific maternal populations most likely to benefit from probiotics, have been recommended. Reassuringly, the probiotic studies that have been performed in postpartum women did not report any major side effects to the mother or infant. Maternal side effects of mild gas or bloating were occasionally noted.

To date, evidence suggests that probiotics may provide an effective measure and alternative to antibiotics in the treatment of lactational mastitis and that postpartum use may also confer additional benefit to the infant. Thus, the efficacy of probiotics in the prevention of mastitis in breastfeeding women should be evaluated.

Outcome measures

The primary outcome will be defined as the incidence of mastitis up to 8 weeks following birth as measured by:
Clinical diagnosis of mastitis OR
At least two of the following breast symptoms: pain, redness/inflammation, lump/swelling AND at least one of the following systemic symptoms: flu-like symptoms (body aches, headaches and chills) or fever ≥ 38°C. These symptoms must be present for at least 24 h.

Secondary maternal outcomes will include breastfeeding duration (total/partial), recurrence of mastitis, development of breast abscess, cracked nipples, use of antibiotics, overall maternal health and well-being, breastfeeding support, number of doctor's visits for probable mastitis, overall doctor's visits, adverse effects of treatment, and incidence of primary mastitis between 2 and 6 months postpartum. Maternal lifestyle factors which may affect breastfeeding outcomes will also be assessed. Acceptability and compliance of the trial product and the APProve-Lite system will also be examined as well as preference for method of postnatal questionnaires.

Secondary infant outcomes will include growth (height and weight) and well-being in the first year of life (measured at 2, 6 and 12 months as assessed via self-report of health conditions including infections (gastrointestinal, respiratory), doctor's visits, admission to hospital, allergic reactions and/or use of antibiotics.

Adverse event reporting

Adverse event

Side effects of the probiotic will be collected via the 2-month questionnaire. Mild gas and bloating are the only known reported side effects of Lactobacillus fermentum. Reported incidents will be reported to the DMC for review.

Serious adverse event

Any maternal or infant deaths will be reported to the ethics committee as required and reviewed by the DMC.

Suspected unsuspected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR)

We do not anticipate any SUSARs in relation to this trial.

Sample size

Given the lack of evidence related to the potential effect of probiotic use for the prevention of mastitis, we used the results from the comparable trials of antibiotics for the prevention of mastitis to determine effect sizes. Although the Cochrane review reported an overall 57% non-significant reduction in mastitis, with individual trials finding an up to 76% reduced risk, we chose a more conservative 50% reduction as a clinically meaningful treatment effect. Based on an expected rate of mastitis in the control group of 18%, two-sided 5% significance level and a power of 80%, we estimated a total sample size of 452 would be required. However, given studies related to the duration of breastfeeding report a cessation rate in the first 8 weeks post-partum of up to 20%, and a potential loss-to follow-up of 5–10% may occur with withdrawals or non-compliance, we inflated the sample size by a further 30% to ensure complete data. Hence, we estimated a total sample size of approximately 600 women would be required (300 per group) for this trial, including all sites.

### Breastfeeding challenges: ACOG committee opinion, number 820 [^058566c1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Mastitis and milk removal — Early recognition and treatment may prevent complications, such as breast abscess, sepsis, and early weaning, and milk stasis is often the initiating factor with the most important management step being frequent and effective milk removal during the treatment. A patient may experience a decrease in her milk supply that usually will improve once she begins to recover, as long as she continues to breastfeed or adequately express her breast milk. Women should be reassured that the antibiotics and antiinflammatory medications used to treat mastitis are safe for infants. Unless otherwise indicated, the patient should be encouraged to either continue breastfeeding her baby or to express her milk. If there is no clinical response to antibiotics, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or an abscess should be considered, and untreated abscess can result in maternal sepsis.

### Treatments for breast engorgement during lactation [^9c010dc5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Breast engorgement is a painful condition affecting large numbers of women in the early postpartum period. It may lead to premature weaning, cracked nipples, mastitis and breast abscess. Various forms of treatment for engorgement have been studied but so far little evidence has been found on an effective intervention.

Objectives

This is an update of a systematic review first published by Snowden et al. in 2001 and subsequently published in 2010. The objective of this update is to seek new information on the best forms of treatment for breast engorgement in lactating women.

Search Methods

We identified studies for inclusion through the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 June 2015) and searched reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility, extracted data and conducted 'Risk of bias' assessments. Where insufficient data were presented in trial reports, we attempted to contact study authors and obtain necessary information. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

In total, we included 13 studies with 919 women. In 10 studies individual women were the unit of analysis and in three studies, individual breasts were the unit of analysis. Four out of 13 studies were funded by an agency with a commercial interest, two received charitable funding, and two were funded by government agencies. Trials examined interventions including non-medical treatments: cabbage leaves (three studies), acupuncture (two studies), ultrasound (one study), acupressure (one study), scraping therapy (Gua Sha) (one study), cold breast-packs and electromechanical massage (one study), and medical treatments: serrapeptase (one study), protease (one study) and subcutaneous oxytocin (one study). The studies were small and used different comparisons with only single studies contributing data to outcomes of this review. We were unable to pool results in meta-analysis and only seven studies provided outcome data that could be included in data and analysis. Non-medical No differences were observed in the one study comparing acupuncture with usual care (advice and oxytocin spray) (risk ratio (RR) 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 1.92; one study; 140 women) in terms of cessation of breastfeeding. However, women in the acupuncture group were less likely to develop an abscess (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.01; one study; 210 women), had less severe symptoms on day five (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.99), and had a lower rate of pyrexia (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.94) than women in the usual care group. In another study with 39 women comparing cabbage leaf extract with placebo, no differences were observed in breast pain (mean difference (MD) 0.40, 95% CI -0.67 to 1.47; low-quality evidence) or breast engorgement (MD 0.20, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.58; low-quality evidence). There was no difference between ultrasound and sham treatment in analgesic requirement (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.51; one study; 45 women; low-quality evidence). A study comparing Gua-Sha therapy with hot packs and massage found a marked difference in breast engorgement (MD -2.42, 95% CI -2.98 to -1.86; one study; 54 women), breast pain (MD -2.01, 95% CI -2.60 to -1.42; one study; 54 women) and breast discomfort (MD -2.33, 95% CI -2.81 to -1.85; one study; 54 women) in favour of Gua-Sha therapy five minutes post-intervention, though both interventions significantly decreased breast temperature, engorgement, pain and discomfort at five and 30 minutes post-treatment. Results from individual trials that could not be included in data analysis suggested that there were no differences between room temperature and chilled cabbage leaves and between chilled cabbage leaves and gel packs, with all interventions producing some relief. Intermittent hot/cold packs applied for 20 minutes twice a day were found to be more effective than acupressure (P < 0.001). Acupuncture did not improve maternal satisfaction with breastfeeding. In another study, women who received breast-shaped cold packs were more likely to experience a reduction in pain intensity than women who received usual care; however, the differences between groups at baseline, and the failure to observe randomisation, make this study at high risk of bias. One study found a decrease in breast temperature (P = 0.03) following electromechanical massage and pumping in comparison to manual methods; however, the high level of attrition and alternating method of sequence generation place this study at high risk of bias. MedicalWomen treated with protease complex were less likely to have no improvement in pain (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.74; one study; 59 women) and swelling (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.79; one study; 59 women) on the fourth day of treatment and less likely to experience no overall change in their symptoms or worsening of symptoms (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.56). It should be noted that it is more than 40 years since the study was carried out, and we are not aware that this preparation is used in current practice. Subcutaneous oxytocin provided no relief at all in symptoms at three days (RR 3.13, 95% CI 0.68 to 14.44; one study; 45 women). Serrapeptase was found to produce some relief in breast pain, induration and swelling, when compared to placebo, with a fewer number of women experiencing slight to no improvement in overallbreast engorgement, swelling and breast pain. Overall, the risk of bias of studies in the review is high. The overall quality as assessed using the GRADE approach was found to be low due to limitations in study design and the small number of women in the included studies, with only single studies providing data for analysis.

Authors' Conclusions

Although some interventions such as hot/cold packs, Gua-Sha (scraping therapy), acupuncture, cabbage leaves and proteolytic enzymes may be promising for the treatment of breast engorgement during lactation, there is insufficient evidence from published trials on any intervention to justify widespread implementation. More robust research is urgently needed on the treatment of breast engorgement.

### Treatments for breast engorgement during lactation [^b4ed3624]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Engorgement is the overfilling of breasts with milk, often occurring in the early days postpartum. It results in swollen, hard, painful breasts and may lead to premature cessation of breastfeeding, decreased milk production, cracked nipples and mastitis. Various treatments have been studied but little consistent evidence has been found on effective interventions.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of different treatments for engorgement in breastfeeding women.

Search Methods

On 2 October 2019, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

All types of randomised controlled trials and all forms of treatment for breast engorgement were eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility, extracted data, conducted 'Risk of bias' assessment and assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

For this udpate, we included 21 studies (2170 women randomised) conducted in a variety of settings. Six studies used individual breasts as the unit of analysis. Trials examined a range of interventions: cabbage leaves, various herbal compresses (ginger, cactus and aloe, hollyhock), massage (manual, electromechanical, Oketani), acupuncture, ultrasound, acupressure, scraping therapy, cold packs, and medical treatments (serrapeptase, protease, oxytocin). Due to heterogeneity, meta-analysis was not possible and data were reported from single trials. Certainty of evidence was downgraded for limitations in study design, imprecision and for inconsistency of effects. We report here findings from key comparisons. Cabbage leaf treatments compared to control For breast pain, cold cabbage leaves may be more effective than routine care (mean difference (MD) -1.03 points on 0–10 visual analogue scale (VAS), 95% confidence intervals (CI) -1.53 to -0.53; 152 women; very low-certainty evidence) or cold gel packs (-0.63 VAS points, 95% CI -1.09 to -0.17; 152 women; very low-certainty evidence), although the evidence is very uncertain. We are uncertain about cold cabbage leaves compared to room temperature cabbage leaves, room temperature cabbage leaves compared to hot water bag, and cabbage leaf extract cream compared to placebo cream because the CIs were wide and included no effect. For breast hardness, cold cabbage leaves may be more effective than routine care (MD -0.58 VAS points, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.34; 152 women; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about cold cabbage leaves compared to cold gel packs because the CIs were wide and included no effect. For breast engorgement, room temperature cabbage leaves may be more effective than a hot water bag (MD -1.16 points on 1–6 scale, 95% CI -1.36 to -0.96; 63 women; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about cabbage leaf extract cream compared to placebo cream because the CIs were wide and included no effect. More women were satisfied with cold cabbage leaves than with routine care (risk ratio (RR) 1.42, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.64; 152 women; low certainty), or with cold gel packs (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.38; 152 women; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if women breastfeed longer following treatment with cold cabbage leaves than routine care because CIs were wide and included no effect. Breast swelling and adverse events were not reported. Compress treatments compared to control For breast pain, herbal compress may be more effective than hot compress (MD -1.80 VAS points, 95% CI -2.07 to -1.53; 500 women; low-certainty evidence). Massage therapy plus cactus and aloe compress may be more effective than massage therapy alone (MD -1.27 VAS points, 95% CI -1.75 to -0.79; 100 women; low-certainty evidence). In a comparison of cactus and aloe compress to massage therapy, the CIs were wide and included no effect. For breast hardness, cactus and aloe cold compress may be more effective than massage (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.87; 102 women; low-certainty evidence). Massage plus cactus and aloe cold compress may reduce the risk of breast hardness compared to massage alone (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.58; 100 women; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the effects of compress treatments on breast engorgement and cessation of breastfeeding because the certainty of evidence was very low. Among women receiving herbal compress treatment, 2/250 experienced skin irritation compared to 0/250 in the hot compress group (moderate-certainty evidence). Breast swelling and women's opinion of treatment were not reported. Medical treatments compared to placebo Protease may reduce breast pain (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.04, 0.74; low-certainty evidence; 59 women) and breast swelling (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.79; 59 women; low-certainty evidence), whereas serrapeptase may reduce the risk of engorgement compared to placebo (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.88; 59 women; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if serrapeptase reduces breast pain or swelling, or if oxytocin reduces breast engorgement compared to placebo, because the CIs were wide and included no effect. No women experienced adverse events in any of the groups receiving serrapeptase, protease or placebo (low-certainty evidence). Breast induration/hardness, women's opinion of treatment and breastfeeding cessation were not reported. Cold gel packs compared to control For breast pain, we are uncertain about the effectiveness of cold gel packs compared to control treatments because the certainty of evidence was very low. For breast hardness, cold gel packs may be more effective than routine care (MD -0.34 points on 1–6 scale, 95% CI -0.60 to -0.08; 151 women; low-certainty evidence). It is uncertain if women breastfeed longer following cold gel pack treatment compared to routine care because the CIs were wide and included no effect. There may be little difference in women's satisfaction with cold gel packs compared to routine care (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.40; 151 women; low-certainty evidence). Breast swelling, engorgement and adverse events were not reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Although some interventions may be promising for the treatment of breast engorgement, such as cabbage leaves, cold gel packs, herbal compresses, and massage, the certainty of evidence is low and we cannot draw robust conclusions about their true effects. Future trials should aim to include larger sample sizes, using women - not individual breasts - as units of analysis.

Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine Clinical Protocol #36 — d. Minimize breast pump usage states that mechanical breast pumps stimulate breast milk production without physiologically extracting milk as an infant will, and that pumping does not provide the opportunity for bacterial exchange between the infant's mouth and mother's breast, and may, therefore, predispose to dysbiosis. Breast pumps also can cause trauma to breast parenchyma and the nipple areolar complex if improper flange sizes are used, suction is too high, or the mother is pumping for an excessive duration of time. Milk expression should be limited to when a mother is separated from her infant or requires pumping for other medically indicated reasons for herself or her infant. Women should not be instructed to express and discard their milk, as bacterial mastitis is not a contraindication to breastfeeding, and women using a breast pump should express milk at a frequency and volume that mimics physiological breastfeeding. Levels of evidence: 2–3. Strength of recommendation: C.

### Study protocol: evaluation of the probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 for the prevention of mastitis in breastfeeding women: a randomised controlled trial [^235890e0]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Although the knowledge of the commensal and/or potential probiotic bacteria that exist in milk of healthy women is limited, bacteria commonly isolated from this substrate include staphylococci, streptococci, micrococci, lactobacilli and enterococci. Of these, lactobacilli are considered to constitute the primary microbiological barrier to infection by intestinal and urogenital pathogens. Thus, breast milk of healthy woman may be a source of potentially probiotic or biotherapeutic lactobacilli with a role in protecting mothers and/or infants against infectious diseases. In contrast, mastitis, characterised by inflammation of one or more lobule of the mammary gland, usually has an infectious origin involving staphylococci, streptococci, and/or corynebacteria, with staphylococcus aureus thought to be the main aetiological agent of acute mastitis. A number of studies have demonstrated that administration of probiotic bacteria, particularly the lactobacilli strain isolated from human milk, has the potential to prevent and treat maternal breast infections caused by Staphalycoccus aureus; the key mechanism for this probiotic treatment of mastitis being related to the stimulation of the host intra-mammary immune system. Moreover, findings from a recent randomised trial revealed that two strains of lactobacilli, Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus fermentum provided some evidence as to their effectiveness as alternatives to antibiotics for the treatment of mastitis. One of these strains, Lactobacillus salivarius, has recently been investigated for the prevention of mastitis. This study, along with previous animal studies have shown promising results. However, due to the limited evidence, there is a need for more thorough investigations of the use of oral probiotics for the prevention of mastitis.

Background

The benefits of breastfeeding are well known, and the World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life and continuing breastfeeding to age two. However, many women stop breastfeeding due to lactational breast abscesses. A breast abscess is a localised accumulation of infected fluid in breast tissue. Abscesses are commonly treated with antibiotics, incision and drainage (I&D) or ultrasound-guided needle aspiration, but there is no consensus on the optimal treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different treatments for the management of breast abscesses in breastfeeding women.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trial Register (27 February 2015). In addition we searched African Journals Online (27 February 2015), Google Scholar (27 February 2015), ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Databases (27 February 2015) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal (27 February 2015). We also checked reference lists of retrieved studies and contacted experts in the field as well as relevant pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating any intervention for treating lactational breast abscesses compared with any other intervention. Studies published in abstract form, quasi-RCTs and cluster-RCTs were not eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy.

Main Results

We included six studies. Overall, trials had an unclear risk of bias for most domains due to poor reporting. Two studies did not stratify data for lactational and non-lactational breast abscesses, and these studies do not contribute to the results. This review is based on data from four studies involving 325 women. Needle aspiration (with and without ultrasound guidance) versus incision and drainage (I&D) Mean time (days) to complete resolution of breast abscess (three studies) - there was substantial heterogeneity among these data (τ² = 47.63, I² = 97%) and a clear difference between subgroups (with or without ultrasound guidance; χ² = 56.88, I² = 98.2%, P = < 0.00001). We did not pool these data in a meta-analysis. Two studies excluded women who had treatment failure when they calculated the mean time to complete resolution. One study found that the time to complete resolution of breast abscess favoured needle aspiration over I&D (mean difference (MD) -6.07; 95% confidence interval (CI) -7.81 to -4.33; n = 36), but excluded 9/22 (41%) women in the needle aspiration group due to treatment failure. Another study reported faster resolution in the needle aspiration group (MD -17.80; 95% CI -21.27 to -14.33; n = 64) but excluded 6/35 (17%) women in the needle aspiration group due to treatment failure. A third study also reported that needle aspiration was associated with a shorter time to complete resolution of breast abscess (MD -16.00; 95%CI -18.73 to -13.27; n = 60); however, the authors did not indicate the number of women who were lost to follow-up for either group, and it is unclear how many women contributed to this result. Considering the limitations of the available data, we do not consider the results to be informative. Continuation of breastfeeding, after treatment (success): results favoured the needle aspiration group, but we did not pool data from the two studies because of substantial unexplained heterogeneity (I(2) = 97%). One study reported that women in the needle aspiration group were more likely to continue breastfeeding (risk ratio (RR) 2.89; 95% CI 1.64 to 5.08; n = 60), whereas the other study found no clear difference (RR 1.09; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.22 n = 70). Treatment failure was more common among women treated with needle aspiration compared to those who underwent I&D (RR 16.12; 95% CI 2.21 to 117.73; two studies, n = 115, low quality evidence). In one study, treatment with needle aspiration failed in 9/22 women who subsequently underwent I&D to treat their breast abscess. In another study, treatment with needle aspiration failed in 6/35 women, who subsequently underwent I&D. All abscesses in the I&D group were successfully treated. The included studies provided limited data for the review's secondary outcomes. No data were reported for adverse events. One study (60 women) reported that women in the needle aspiration group were more satisfied with their treatment than women who received I&D to treat their breast abscesses. Incision and drainage (I&D) with or without antibioticsOne study (150 women) compared the value of adding a broad-spectrum cephalosporin (single dose or a course of treatment) to women who underwent I&D for breast abscesses. The mean time to resolution of breast abscess was reported as being similar in all groups (although women with infection were excluded). Mean time to resolution for women who received a course of antibiotics was reported as 7.3 days, 6.9 days for women who received a single dose of antibiotics and 7.4 days for women who did not receive antibiotics. Standard deviations, P values and CIs were not reported and prevented further analysis. No data were reported for any continuation of breastfeeding after treatment (success). For treatment failure, there was no clear difference between the groups of women who received antibiotics (either a single dose or a course of antibiotics) and those who did not (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.36 to 2.76). Included studies rarely reported this review's secondary outcomes (including adverse events). For post-operative complications/morbidity, there was no difference in the risk of wound infections between the antibiotics and no antibiotics groups (RR 0.58; 95% CI 0.29 to 1.17), irrespective of whether women received a single dose or a course of antibiotics.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to determine whether needle aspiration is a more effective option to I&D for lactational breast abscesses, or whether an antibiotic should be routinely added to women undergoing I&D for lactational breast abscesses. We graded the evidence for the primary outcome of treatment failure as low quality, with downgrading based on including small studies with few events and unclear risk of bias.

This knowledge will allow practitioners to provide appropriate management advice about modifiable risk factors, such as the use of pumps or inappropriate medication. They also could identify those women at an increased risk of developing mastitis, such as those having a familial history of mastitis, before delivery, and thus develop strategies to prevent this condition. There are still many questions to answer about infectious mastitis, but work is in progress to broaden our knowledge in this relevant Public Health issue.

ABM Clinical Protocol #36 — areas for future research in mastitis emphasize that clinical studies on mastitis and related disorders are limited by study design and confounding factors and that nipple trauma appearing to be a cause of mastitis likely represents an association rather than a causation. It adds that nipple trauma is a frequent sequela of hyperlactation, which is a risk factor for mastitis, and that higher quality studies are needed to determine precise recommendations regarding antibiotics and to clarify prevalence of bacterial mastitis versus engorgement and/or inflammatory mastitis given telephone triage prescribing practices. The protocol also states that even small quantities of antibiotics in human milk alters the diversity and resilience of the human milk microbiome, that the use of probiotics warrants further research, and that as women in the peripartum period are at their lifetime highest risk for developing an anxiety or mood disorder, the distinction between symptoms of mood and anxiety disorders versus mastitis should also be explored.

### Maternal knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding breastfeeding and mastitis [^b42d68d5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a comprehensive approach to infant feeding, advocating for exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) for the initial 6 months, followed by the introduction of complementary feeding at 6 months, while continuing breastfeeding up to 2 years and beyond. This practice, when adhered to during the first half-year of a child's life, has demonstrated a substantial reduction in infant morbidity and mortality, with well-documented positive impacts on child growth and maternal well-being. WHO research underscores the protective nature of breastfeeding, being twice as effective in ensuring child health during the first year compared to non-breastfeeding practices. Despite these recommendations, global statistics indicate suboptimal compliance, with only 39% of infants in developing countries exclusively breastfed for the initial 6 months, while 6% were never breastfed. Furthermore, 86% and 68% of infants and children continued breastfeeding at 6–11 months and 12–23 months, respectively. The practice of breastfeeding is influenced not only by socio-demographic factors but also by maternal knowledge and attitudes toward optimal breastfeeding practices. Regarding lactational mastitis, it can be categorized into various types, with acute mastitis (AM) and sub-acute mastitis (SAM) being the most prevalent among breastfeeding women, and recognizing the factors associated with mastitis is imperative as it can hinder optimal breastfeeding practices, potentially prompting premature supplementary feeding and leading to breastfeeding cessation.

A Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices (KAP) survey is a research tool that assesses a group's knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors on a specific subject, with the underlying premise in health literacy being that knowledge influences attitudes, which subsequently shape behaviors. A KAP study may help with understanding of what mothers know about breastfeeding and mastitis, their attitudes towards these topics, and their actual practices. This study may reveal gaps in knowledge, misconceptions, and areas where improvements are needed. This information is crucial for developing targeted educational and support strategies to enhance breastfeeding rates, reduce mastitis, and improve maternal and infant health.

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate maternal KAP towards breastfeeding and mastitis.

Breastfeeding-related mastitis — decrease inflammation and pain: Ice and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can reduce edema and inflammation and provide symptomatic relief, and acetaminophen/paracetamol can provide analgesia; practical examples include ice applied every hour or more frequently if desired, ibuprofen 800 mg every 8 hours, and acetaminophen/paracetamol 1,000 mg every 8 hours in the acute setting. Although heat will vasodilate and may worsen symptoms, it also may provide comfort for some patients, and the use of warm showers and antipyretics did not improve mastitis outcomes in a randomized controlled trial. Sunflower or soy lecithin 5–10 g daily by mouth may be taken to reduce inflammation in ducts and emulsify milk. Levels of evidence: 1–3 with strength of recommendation C.

### Mastitis: rapid evidence review [^dbf05a02]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Mastitis represents a spectrum of inflammatory conditions. Lactational mastitis is the most common, with an approximate incidence of 10% in the United States, and it usually occurs in the first 3 months postpartum. Diagnosis is made clinically based on the presence of symptoms such as fever, malaise, focal breast tenderness, and overlying skin erythema or hyperpigmentation without the need for laboratory tests or imaging. However, obtaining milk cultures should be considered to guide antibiotic therapy, and ultrasonography should be performed to identify abscesses in immuno-compromised patients or those with worsening or recurrent symptoms. Because most cases of mastitis are caused by inflammation and not a true infection, a 1- to 2-day trial of conservative measures (i.e., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ice application, feeding the infant directly from the breast, and minimizing pumping) is often sufficient for treatment. If there is no improvement in symptoms, narrow-spectrum antibiotics may be prescribed to cover common skin flora (e.g. Staphylococcus, Streptococcus). Most patients can be treated as outpatients with oral antibiotics; however, if the condition worsens or there is a concern for sepsis, intravenous antibiotics and hospital admission may be required. Use of probiotics for treatment or prevention is not supported by good evidence. Factors that increase the risk of mastitis include overstimulation of milk production and tissue trauma from aggressive breast massage; therefore, frequent overfeeding, excessive pumping to empty the breast, heat application, and breast massage are no longer recommended because they may worsen the condition. The best prevention is a proper lactation technique, including a good infant latch, and encouraging physiologic breastfeeding rather than pumping, if possible.

Recurrent mastitis — Examine patients and obtain milk culture to establish a diagnosis of true recurrent mastitis rather than treating empirically, as breast milk culture can identify and provide sensitivities of uncommon pathogens and resistant bacteria; MRSA and resistant CoNS will not respond to typical antibiotics used for acute mastitis such as dicloxacillin or cephalexin. Ensure resolution of bacterial mastitis with follow-up examination, evaluate breastfeeding and/or pumping for risk factors, and consider daily probiotic use with L. fermentum or, preferably, L. salivarius for prevention. Prophylactic antibiotics have not been shown to be effective in the prevention of mastitis and may select antibiotic-resistant strains. Multiple recurrences in the same location warrants radiology evaluation to rule out an underlying mass or other abnormality such as granulomatous mastitis; any concern for inflammatory breast cancer, which can present with progressive erythema, breast retraction, and peau d'orange appearance, warrants urgent referral to breast surgery and oncology. Levels of evidence: 1–3. Strength of recommendations: B–C.

Breastfeeding — infectious disease and mastitis guidance states that women with active herpetic lesions on the breast "should refrain from breastfeeding or using expressed milk from the affected breast until the lesions have resolved" but "may breastfeed from the unaffected breast when lesions on the affected breast are covered completely". Women infected with West Nile virus "may breastfeed". For mothers who are hepatitis B surface antigen positive, infants "should receive the initial dose of hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin within 12 hours of birth", and "there is no need to delay initiation of breastfeeding until after the infant is immunized". For hepatitis C, transmission via breast milk "has not been documented", and AAP/CDC "do not consider maternal hepatitis C virus infection a contraindication to breastfeeding", though mothers with hepatitis C who have "cracked or bleeding nipples should refrain from breastfeeding from the affected breast or feeding expressed milk from that breast until the nipple has healed". Mastitis "occurs in one-third of postpartum women", regular feeding or milk expression is "an adjunct to other treatment", "antibiotics may be indicated", "approximately 10% of mastitis cases progress to breast abscesses, which require drainage", and "breastfeeding can continue on the affected side as long as the infant's mouth does not contact purulent drainage".

### An all-purpose nipple ointment versus lanolin in treating painful damaged nipples in breastfeeding women: a randomized controlled trial [^7d551163]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The negative outcomes associated with painful and damaged nipples have been widely documented in the breastfeeding literature. Numerous studies have been conducted evaluating topical preparations to treat nipple pain and damage with equivocal findings. No studies have evaluated the effectiveness of the increasingly popular all-purpose nipple ointment (APNO). The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the effect of the APNO versus lanolin on nipple pain among breastfeeding women with damaged nipples.

Subjects and Methods

A double-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted in a large single-site, tertiary-care hospital in Toronto, ON, Canada. Breastfeeding women (n = 151) identified as having damage to one or both nipples were randomized to apply either APNO (intervention group) or lanolin (control group) to their nipples according to the trial protocol. The primary outcome was nipple pain at 1 week after randomization measured using the Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire. Additional outcomes at 1 week after randomization and 12 weeks postpartum included nipple yeast symptoms and/or mastitis, rates of breastfeeding duration and exclusivity, and maternal satisfaction with infant feeding method and treatment ointment.

Results

There were no significant group differences in mean pain scores at 1 week after randomization. Women in the lanolin group reported significantly greater satisfaction with their infant feeding method and had nonsignificantly higher breastfeeding duration and exclusivity rates at 12 weeks postpartum.

Conclusion

Results suggest that APNO is not superior to lanolin in treating painful, damaged nipples.

ABM Clinical Protocol #36 — management considerations for lactational mastitis state that traditional recommendations to augment milk removal to counteract milk stasis and to massage breast tissue to relieve ductal obstruction from milk "plugs" lack physiological validity. The document notes that frequent stimulation of breasts with congested alveolar cells worsens hyperemia and edema and that this not only worsens pain and edema, but also decreases the ability of an infant to obtain an atraumatic latch and effectively withdraw milk from the breast. It further states that frequent pumping also disrupts the milk microbiome, potentiating the development of mammary dysbiosis and increasing the risk for bacterial mastitis, and that massage of the mammary gland causes capillary injury and tissue necrosis and is a primary risk factor for phlegmon and abscess development.

### Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine clinical protocol # 36: the mastitis spectrum, revised 2022 [^1aea0a8b]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Pathophysiology of mastitis spectrum — mastitis is inflammation of the mammary gland that most often presents in a segmental distribution of ducts, alveoli, and surrounding connective tissue, and ductal lumens can be narrowed by edema and hyperemia associated with hyperlactation as well as mammary dysbiosis. Mammary dysbiosis, or disruption of the milk microbiome, results from a complex interplay of factors including maternal genetics and medical conditions, exposure to antibiotics, use of probiotics, regular use of breast pumps, and Cesarean birth. Basic science research has demonstrated that multiple factors contribute to the development of mastitis and include host factors such as hyperlactation, microbial factors such as diversity of the milk microbiome, and medical factors such as antibiotic and probiotic use. Milk stasis has been postulated to be a potential initiating factor for mastitis, although scientific evidence has not proven a causation, and no evidence exists that specific foods cause mastitis. The lactating breast is a dynamic gland that responds to internal and external hormonal stimulation; the breast requires feedback inhibition to regulate milk production, and although reducing milk removal may transiently increase pain and erythema from alveolar distention and vascular congestion, it ultimately prevents future episodes as feedback inhibitor of lactation and other regulatory hormones decrease milk production. Mothers who experience persistent high milk production despite eliminating iatrogenic causes of excessive milk removal may require additional pharmacological treatment of hyperlactation.

Randomisation

Randomisation to either "probiotic" or "placebo" will take place immediately after consent within 72 h of birth. The randomisation schedule will be prepared and centrally administered by a researcher not involved in patient care. A computer random number generator will be used to prepare the randomisation schedule in blocks of 4 and 6, and stratified by the incidence of previous mastitis. The randomisation sequence will be concealed until all data has been collected. The participant and researcher will be blinded as to treatment allocation. Participants using the mobile phone application system (APProve-Lite) will be randomised via a central password-protected web-based application developed by the APProve clinical trial unit.

Data collection

To assess the comparability of the study groups, baseline demographic and medical information will be collected at the time of entry into the study. The baseline assessment will include maternal age, socio-demographic data, smoking and alcohol use, infections during pregnancy, allergies, use of vitamins/supplements/probiotics in the previous month, history of prior pregnancies and lactations including previous mastitis and breastfeeding duration, and recent use of antibiotics. This information will be obtained from the participant and/or her medical record.

At the time of discharge, data related to the birth and infant feeding will be collected to evaluate the impact of events and outcomes around the time of birth on infant feeding practices. This information will be ascertained from both the participant and medical records and will include site, gestation at birth, mode of birth, antibiotics during labour, birth or postpartum, complications of birth, length of hospital stay and initiation of infant feeding. Baseline infant data on general characteristics and well-being will also be collected. This will include information on infant sex, birthweight, Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min, resuscitation and any morbidity and will be obtained from the infant's medical record.

Follow-up questionnaires will be used to evaluate long term maternal and infant secondary outcomes as detailed above with timing and method of collected data presented in Table 1.

### A failed RCT to determine if antibiotics prevent mastitis: cracked nipples colonized with Staphylococcus aureus: a randomized treatment trial [^b5b91110]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2004). Low credibility.

Background

A small, non-blinded, RCT (randomised controlled trial) had reported that oral antibiotics reduced the incidence of mastitis in lactating women with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)- colonized cracked nipples. We aimed to replicate the study with a more rigorous design and adequate sample size.

Methods

Our intention was to conduct a double-blind placebo-controlled trial to determine if an antibiotic (flucloxacillin) could prevent mastitis in lactating women with S. aureus -colonized cracked nipples. We planned to recruit two groups of 133 women with S. aureus- colonized cracked nipples.

Results

We spent over twelve months submitting applications to five hospital ethics committees and seven funding bodies, before commencing the trial. Recruitment to the trial was very slow and only ten women were randomized to the trial after twelve months, and therefore the trial was stopped early.

Conclusions

In retrospect we should have conducted a feasibility study, which would have revealed the low number of women in these Melbourne hospitals (maternity wards and breastfeeding clinics) with damaged nipples. The appropriate use of antibiotics for breastfeeding women with cracked nipples still needs to be tested.

### Physical therapy intervention for breast symptoms in lactating women: a randomized controlled trial [^2087b7c7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Breast pain, tenderness, redness, engorgement, fever, malaise, chills, lethargy, sweating, headache, nipple damage, and a hot spot on the breast are common complaints in women who breastfeed. Despite the high prevalence of breast symptoms in lactating women during the first 12 weeks after childbirth, some breast symptoms can occur or persist throughout the entire period of lactation, which may last up to six months. If these breast symptoms are not managed and treated during early postpartum clinic visits, the discomfort of the lactating breast may lead to various breast disorders, such as blocked milk ducts, mastitis, and abscess, potentially resulting in early cessation of breastfeeding.

Therapeutic ultrasound (91%); education and advice regarding eliminating duct obstruction/trauma, feeding, lifestyle changes, thermal/cryo therapy, and alternative interventions (83%); and massage (54%) have been reported as the three most common interventions provided by the physical therapists for breast symptoms in lactating women. However, postpartum women are often unaware of physical therapy treatment options for breast symptoms, with some women having only been prescribed antibiotics and/or encouraged by the doctor to use active expression of human-milk to relieve the symptoms. The majority of women felt that care for breastfeeding women with breast symptoms could be improved and were desperate for help from healthcare professionals.

A Cochrane review identified 17 different interventions for breast engorgement in breastfeeding women and concluded that there is insufficient evidence on the effectiveness of any intervention for breast engorgement to justify widespread implementation. Furthermore, the evidence on the effects of ultrasound, education, and massage delivered in combination is inconsistent due to various intervention designs. Therefore, more randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to draw evidence-based conclusions regarding the effects of the combination of physical therapy interventions (i.e. therapeutic ultrasound, education, and massage) for breast symptoms during lactation.

This study aimed to explore the effects of the combination of therapeutic ultrasound, education, and massage on breast symptoms in lactating women and to compare them to patients receiving sham ultrasound treatment and usual obstetric care. We hypothesized that the outcomes of interest would improve following the physical therapy interventions, and the ultrasound group would show a greater improvement in the outcomes compared to the sham and usual care groups.

### Mastitis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA): the calm before the storm? [^828746b2]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Post-partum mastitis is a common infection in breastfeeding women, with an incidence of 9.5–16% in recent literature. Over the past decade, community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has emerged as a significant pathogen in soft-tissue infections presenting to the emergency department. The incidence of mastitis caused by MRSA is unknown at this time, but likely increasing.

We review the data on prevention and treatment of mastitis and address recent literature demonstrating increases in MRSA infections in the post-partum population and how we should change our practices in light of this emerging pathogen.

Case Report

We present a case of simple mastitis in a health care worker who failed to improve until treated with antibiotics appropriate for a MRSA infection.

Conclusion

Recent evidence suggests that just as MRSA has become the prominent pathogen in other soft-tissue infections, mastitis is now increasingly caused by this pathogen. Physicians caring for patients with mastitis need to be aware of this bacteriologic shift to treat appropriately.

### Probiotics vs. antibiotics to treat lactation-associated… [^6a34c809]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Background: Mastitis affects up to 33 percent of lactating mothers and is a common reason why women stop breastfeeding. It can also be difficult to treat because of its polymicrobial nature. Several strains of lactobacilli have shown promise as probiotic agents that might be useful in treating mastitis. Arroyo and colleagues compared the effectiveness of probiotic and antibiotic therapies in women with lactation-associated mastitis. The Study: A total of 352 women with mastitis symptoms were randomized to receive one of three treatments: a daily capsule with 200 mg of a freeze-dried probiotic containing 9 log₁₀ colony-forming units per mL of Lactobacillus fermentum, a similar amount of Lactobacillus salivarius, or an antibiotic prescribed by their physician. Patients were followed for 21 days, with pain scores and breast milk samples obtained at the beginning and end of the study.

All patients had breast inflammation, painful breastfeeding, and initial milk bacterial counts of more than 4 log₁₀ CFU per mL. Women with mammary abscesses, Raynaud syndrome, or any other breast-related pathology were excluded. Results: Initial pain scores and bacterial counts were similar among the three groups. The three most common bacterial species identified were Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus mitis in statistically similar proportions among groups. By day 21, a greater bacterial reduction occurred in women receiving probiotics compared with antibiotics, with the greatest reduction in the L. salivarius group. Breast pain scores were also significantly lower in the probiotic groups, with complete recovery in 88 percent of the L. fermentum and 85 percent of the L. salivarius group by day 21, compared with 28. 7 percent of the antibiotic group.

Recurrence of mastitis was also significantly more common in the antibiotic group than in the L. fermentum or L. salivarius group. Conclusion: The authors conclude that L. fermentum or L. salivarius is an effective alternative to antibiotics for the treatment of infectious mastitis during lactation.

### A failed RCT to determine if antibiotics prevent mastitis: cracked nipples colonized with Staphylococcus aureus: a randomized treatment trial [^8bffee92]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2004). Low credibility.

BACKGROUND: A small, non-blinded, RCT (randomised controlled trial) had reported that oral antibiotics reduced the incidence of mastitis in lactating women with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)- colonized cracked nipples. We aimed to replicate the study with a more rigorous design and adequate sample size. METHODS: Our intention was to conduct a double-blind placebo-controlled trial to determine if an antibiotic (flucloxacillin) could prevent mastitis in lactating women with S. aureus-colonized cracked nipples. We planned to recruit two groups of 133 women with S. aureus-colonized cracked nipples. RESULTS: We spent over twelve months submitting applications to five hospital ethics committees and seven funding bodies, before commencing the trial. Recruitment to the trial was very slow and only ten women were randomized to the trial after twelve months, and therefore the trial was stopped early. CONCLUSIONS: In retrospect we should have conducted a feasibility study, which would have revealed the low number of women in these Melbourne hospitals (maternity wards and breastfeeding clinics) with damaged nipples. The appropriate use of antibiotics for breastfeeding women with cracked nipples still needs to be tested.

### A failed RCT to determine if antibiotics prevent mastitis: cracked nipples colonized with Staphylococcus aureus: a randomized treatment trial [^7673f846]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Mastitis is a common problem for breastfeeding women. Before planning a trial to reduce the number of lactating women who develop mastitis, we reviewed the literature to identify factors that may be associated with mastitis and to examine previous trials. A relatively small number of trials was identified which included mastitis as one of the outcome measures (see Table). Using historical controls, prophylactic topical penicillin ointment was found to be ineffective, while hand disinfectant at the mother's bedside appeared to reduce mastitis. A Finnish study examined "breast massage" (which appears to be a variation of "nipple toughening") and found no impact of this practice on mastitis.

Table 1
Trials to prevent mastitis

The authors of one trial were convinced that their intervention was effective, despite methodological difficulties. Livingstone and Stringer conducted a randomised trial for women with cracked nipples with positive cultures for Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), in Canada. They compared topical antibiotics, oral antibiotics and "optimal breastfeeding advice" and found better improvement in nipple healing in the women given oral antibiotics. In addition, they found 16 women out of 65 (25%) given non-systemic treatment developed mastitis within 7 days, compared to 1 of 19 women (5%) given systemic antibiotics (chi-square, p = 0.065) [not 0.005 as stated in their abstract]. The authors have concluded that cracked nipples colonized with S. aureus should be "treated aggressively with systemic antibiotics". However, the chi-square test used by the authors is inappropriate because one cell contains an expected value less than 5. Using Fisher's exact test, the p value is 0.10.

As the Livingstone and Stringer trial had been published in a major lactation journal and was likely to be very influential in practice, it needs to be replicated in a more rigorous manner in order to assess the usefulness and safety of the intervention. Our intention was to replicate that study with an adequate sample size, rigorous definitions of nipple damage and mastitis, and double blinding of the intervention.

### Maternal knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding breastfeeding and mastitis [^e6f94522]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

The distribution of knowledge dimensions regarding breastfeeding and mastitis revealed both areas of strength and potential misconceptions among the participants. Notably, a substantial percentage of respondents correctly recognized the benefits of breastfeeding for infant intellectual and growth development, the association between low mood and mastitis risk, and the role of breastfeeding in enhancing infants' immunity to infections and diseases like childhood asthma. These findings are consistent with existing literature, highlighting the awareness of these crucial aspects of breastfeeding. However, it is concerning that a significant number of participants incorrectly believed that mothers with other related diseases during pregnancy cannot breastfeed, that breastfeeding should cease when mastitis occurs, and that babies need to be breastfed on a strict schedule. These misconceptions can have negative implications for breastfeeding initiation and duration. In light of these results, clinical practice can be improved by addressing and correcting these misconceptions through targeted educational programs. Healthcare providers should emphasize the safety and importance of breastfeeding for mothers with certain medical conditions during pregnancy, provide guidance on managing mastitis while continuing to breastfeed, and promote responsive feeding rather than rigid schedules to encourage successful breastfeeding experiences. These efforts may contribute to a more informed and confident breastfeeding population, ultimately leading to improved maternal and infant health outcomes.

The attitude dimension offers important insights into how individuals perceive breastfeeding and related aspects. A significant portion of participants acknowledged the benefits of breastfeeding, including its positive impact on infant growth and development, emotional bonding between mother and child, and the superiority of breastmilk as an ideal infant food. These attitudes align with established literature and emphasize the significance of promoting and supporting breastfeeding in clinical practice. However, it's notable that a considerable proportion of respondents expressed concerns about the burdens associated with breastfeeding, suggesting potential challenges or misconceptions that need to be addressed. In clinical practice, there is a need to address and alleviate these concerns through personalized support and education. Additionally, the positive attitudes towards preventing lactational mastitis and the willingness to acquire knowledge in this area present opportunities for implementing targeted education and prevention strategies. Healthcare providers can play a pivotal role in educating pregnant and postpartum women about mastitis prevention, fostering proactive management, and recognizing early symptoms.

Lactational breast abscess — drain the abscess to achieve source control, with needle aspiration with fluid culture and sensitivity often recommended as the first-line intervention for lactational abscess; however, patients most often require recurrent aspirations and drain placement as the initial intervention should be considered for definitive management at the time of the index procedure. Drains or skin stents should be placed to gravity rather than suction, and vacuum-assisted wound devices on a lactating breast should be strictly avoided. After aspiration or drain placement, mothers should continue breastfeeding from the affected breast, with milk fistula rate < 2%, and antibiotic duration is commonly 10–14 days, though a shorter course may be appropriate if cellulitis resolves rapidly. Tissue inflammation and phlegmonous changes may persist for several weeks; patients should undergo interval examination and imaging to ensure resolution. Levels of evidence: 2–3.

### Mechanisms and therapeutic effectiveness of lactobacilli [^70f83587]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Mastitis

Mastitis is an infectious inflammation of one or more breast lobuleswith S. aureus and S. epidermidis being the most frequent aetiological agentsand with a prevalence of 3–33% among breastfeeding mothers. Multidrug resistance and biofilm formation by pathogenic bacteria account for the lack of efficacy of antibiotics used for treatment of mastitis. In this context, new strategies based on probiotics, as alternatives or complements to antibiotic therapy for the management of mastitis, are gaining a prominent role. Clinical studies of lactobacilli showing efficacy for treatment of mastitis have been summarised in table 7.

Immunomodulatory activity

Lactobacilli are potential adjuvants triggering mucosal and systemic immune responses. The immunomodulatory effects of lactobacilli observed in various physiological systems include increased natural killer cell cytotoxicityand induction of interferon-γ productionand cytokine expression. In order to exert these immunomodulatory effects, lactobacilli must resist to digestive system processesand adhere to the host's intestinal epithelium. Lactobacilli (in particular L. acidophilus) can also be administered together with bifidobacteria in order to enhance the immune system. This effect is accomplished by enhancing systemic/local immunityand concurrently attenuating systemic stress response. Clinical studies of lactobacilli showing immunomodulatory activity in various pathologies have been summarised in table 8.

Gastrointestinal pathologies

Even if the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBD) remains unknown, the luminal microbiome plays a key role in triggering and maintaining a balanced environment within the GI tract. Dysbiosis may also play a key role in IBD. Evidence from animal modelsand clinical observationsoutlined the putative therapeutic role of probiotic strains for IBD treatment. Restoring microbiota-host symbiosis can represent a promising approach for treatment of the above mentioned conditions and can be applied to other GI pathologies, as summarised in table 9.

Gastrointestinal tract survival

Strains belonging to L. and B. genera are the most studied in clinical practice. The number of bacterial strains that reach the gut mucosa and colon, depends on several factors such as strain used, gastric transit survival, and acid and bile tolerance. Clinical studies of lactobacilli showing ability to survive in the GI tract have been summarised in table 10.

Breastfeeding during maternal HIV — key directives include "Administer appropriate ARV prophylaxis starting at birth". If detectable viral load develops during breastfeeding, "the Panels recommend that breastfeeding be temporarily stopped or discontinued and replacement feeding initiated. Additional infant ARV prophylaxis and infant testing are also recommended". The guidance states to "Provide guidance on good breast care, including strategies to avoid and promptly resolve over production of breast milk, milk stasis, and breast engorgement, which can lead to sore nipples, mastitis, or breast abscess", and to "Promptly identify and treat mastitis, thrush, and cracked or bleeding nipples", noting "These conditions may increase the risk of HIV transmission through breastfeeding, although the impact of these conditions in the context of ART and viral suppression is unknown". It also advises to "Develop a joint plan for weaning with family and providers", and that "weaning over a 2- to 4-week period might be safer", and further notes "There is little evidence to guide the infant HIV testing schedule during breastfeeding, and there have been transmissions detected many weeks or even months after reported cessation of breastfeeding".

### ABM clinical protocol # 35: supporting breastfeeding during maternal or child hospitalization [^5e9d804d]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Supporting breastfeeding during maternal or child hospitalization — introduction and scope emphasizes that hospitalization of a breastfeeding mother or child can disrupt breastfeeding, leading to unintended weaning and complications such as mastitis, that no formal guidelines exist for management of lactation during hospitalization, and that this protocol outlines recommended care and standards to implement these policies. The document notes that staff outside obstetric, pediatric, or neonatal units may have limited experience and knowledge of lactation physiology or management and may not understand the short-term and long-term risks of disruptions to lactation. It describes that concerns may arise when a breastfeeding infant or young child is present on adult inpatient, perioperative, or intensive care unit settings, including child safety and hospital liability, and that management related to medications, procedures, and fluids may require special attention. It emphasizes assessing a breastfeeding mother's desires regarding initiating or continuing lactation and meeting those needs through shared decision making. Related guidance on model maternity policy, analgesia and anesthesia for the breastfeeding mother, preprocedural fasting, and radiology and nuclear medicine may serve as useful adjuncts. Background statements affirm that breastfeeding is the biologically normative way to feed human infants and that early cessation of breastfeeding is associated with increased infections and chronic diseases in children. The protocol also clarifies that these are guidelines that do not delineate an exclusive course of treatment or serve as standards of medical care, that variations may be appropriate for individual patients, and that the Academy recognizes not all lactating individuals identify as women and its position is to interpret clinical protocols within an inclusive framework for breastfeeding, chestfeeding, and human milk-feeding individuals.

### Case-control study of risk factors for infectious mastitis in Spanish breastfeeding women [^ddfddbb2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Another relevant factor associated with mastitis was the use of antibiotics during breastfeeding. In fact, widespread use of broad spectrum antibiotics is leading to increasing rates of antimicrobial resistance among mastitis-causing agents. On the other hand, biofilm formation is an important virulence factor of the strains implicated in mastitis, taking in account that the penetration capacity through bacterial biofilms depends on each antibiotic. Resistance to antibiotics and ability to form biofilms are common findings among mastitis-causing strains and may explain the often recurrent nature of this infectious condition. This fact emphasizes the need of a milk culture and antibiogram for a rational treatment of mastitis. Widespread antibiotic therapy used to treat throat infections could also affect the mammary gland microbiota and lead to mastitis. Conversely, broad range antibiotics to treat mastitis are linked to a variety of adverse effects, including urinary infections and vaginal candidiasis. Microbial habitats in the human body, including the skin, constitute a network of interrelated communities. This could explain why pathogens involved in throat and urinary infections may spread to the mammary gland and those implicated in mastitis development may spread to throat and urinary tract. In this work, the bivariate analysis revealed that urinary and skin infections were also more frequent among breastfeeding mothers with mastitis. Interestingly, anemia was also more common in the group of women with mastitis, since women suffering from anemia might be more vulnerable to infections. In addition, iron supplements enhance growth and virulence of Staphylococcus aureus and other mastitis-associated species; as a consequence, women receiving them may also be more prone to mastitis. No clinical trials have evaluated the impact of iron supplementation on mastitis but the study of iron acquisition pathways seems to be a good target to define the underlying mechanisms of mastitis severity.

Consider obtaining local susceptibility testing and resistance patterns and proceed to empiric therapy. Consider obtaining early milk culture in mothers expressing breast milk for an immunocompromised infant in the NICU, healthcare workers in areas with a high prevalence of MRSA, and patients with recurrent infections.

### Pain management for postpartum pain: a narrative review [^430e78e7]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Breast Pain

Postpartum breast pain is a common concern among lactating women and can compromise breastfeeding continuation. A study by Amir et alreported that over 70% of first-time mothers experience breast pain. Common etiologies include ductal obstruction, mastitis, breast abscesses, nipple blisters, dermatitis, vasospasm, and milk stasis — with ductal blockage being the most prevalent.

Pathophysiologically, pain is often triggered by retained milk and subsequent inflammation or infection of breast tissue. Predisposing factors include inadequate milk expression, poor latch, sustained breast compression, and hyperlactation. Retained milk creates a favorable environment for microbial growth. A systematic review by Christine et alidentified Staphylococcus aureus and Candida species as the primary pathogens associated with mastitis. However, a retrospective cohort study by Betts et alin 2021 reported that many patients did not experience sustained relief following antifungal treatment. Based on these findings, the evidence supporting Candida infection as a cause of breastfeeding-related breast pain remains insufficient. The study recommends that clinical evaluations should not rely on presumptive diagnoses based solely on suspected Candida involvement.

Management of postpartum breast pain should be based on the specific etiology. In cases of ductal obstruction, warm compresses, gentle massage, and milk expression (manual or through breastfeeding) are effective. For infectious mastitis, mild cases can be managed conservatively, while moderate-to-severe cases may require antibiotics (cephalosporins). Breast abscesses often necessitate ultrasound-guided aspiration or surgical drainage. For nipple-related conditions, such as blisters or fissures, proper hygiene, drying, and application of breast milk can prevent secondary infection. Fluconazole may be considered when fungal infection is confirmed by culture or clinical evidence.

In addition, several non-pharmacological therapies have been preliminarily applied and validated in the clinical management of breast pain, offering more treatment options — particularly for patients who are unable or unwilling to use medications. A study by Çağan et aldemonstrated that the Oketani breast massage technique can effectively relieve breast engorgement. Han et alfound that auricular acupressure significantly increased the pressure pain threshold in specific regions of the breast, suggesting its potential effectiveness in alleviating breast tenderness. Although these interventions have shown promising initial results, their efficacy and underlying mechanisms require further confirmation through high-quality studies.

### Study protocol: evaluation of the probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 for the prevention of mastitis in breastfeeding women: a randomised controlled trial [^759c1ed2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Independent assessment of intervention and mobile phone application system

A separate sub-study will be conducted to assess the independent effect of the probiotic without the potential influence of the APProve-Lite system. Despite the APP being a tool to facilitate data collection and improve compliance, it may be viewed as an intervention in itself, and have an unintended effect on study outcomes. Assessment of the APP is important to ensure this tool does not bias or exert any influence on study outcomes. This will involve a sub-study utilising a pragmatic and 'standard follow-up' approach to data collection and follow-up of women throughout the trial for collection of information on symptoms related to study outcomes and ensuring compliance with the ingestion of the intervention.

The sub-study will involve a sample of 100 women who will be recruited on randomly selected days of each month. These women will be recruited and enrolled into the trial in an identical way to those of the APP group and randomised to the intervention as in the main study. However, they will not be asked to use the APP throughout the trial. Rather, these women will be provided with a 2-month calendar diary to complete each day. They will be encouraged to place this in a visible location such as on the fridge to encourage daily compliance. Here they will record daily ingestion of the probiotic and symptoms via check boxes (daily survey). They will be provided with an addressed reply-paid envelope in which to post the completed diary back to the recruiting center. Each week, women will be emailed a link to an online Survey Monkey questionnaire to complete (weekly survey). At the end of the intervention, women will be emailed a web-link to the 2, 6 and 12-month follow-up questionnaires.

Data monitoring committee

The data monitoring committee (DMC) will be established to monitor the trial and review the study progress. The DMC will meet once half way through trial recruitment to review the safety data and monitor the progress of the trial. There will be only one analysis at the end of the trial. The Committee members will be independent of the trial, free of conflicts with any of the investigative team. The terms of reference and functions are derived from the principles established by the Data and Safety Monitoring Boards: Lessons, Ethics, Statistics Study Group charter. The DMC will report its recommendations directly to the Trial Steering Committee, who are the authors of this protocol.

### Breastfeeding challenges: ACOG committee opinion, number 820 [^ac1f880d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Breast engorgement — definition, timing, prevention, and management: Breast engorgement is the physiologic bilateral breast fullness that occurs most often between day three and day five postpartum. Women who undergo a cesarean delivery typically experience peak engorgement 24–49 hours later than those who give birth vaginally. A study on postpartum engorgement found a reduction in engorgement in women who expressed colostrum once or twice for 25–30 minutes the first 1–2 days (vaginal birth) or 2–3 days (cesarean delivery), suggesting early milk expression may help prevent engorgement. Data on prevention of engorgement are limited and there is insufficient evidence to recommend specific treatment, and a systematic review found insufficient evidence to recommend a particular treatment regimen. Patients experiencing engorgement should use milk expression minimally to relieve symptoms, because excessive breast emptying may induce an oversupply with associated risks of mastitis and plugged ducts; engorgement may be managed expectantly if symptoms are mild and the infant is able to latch appropriately.

Regarding attitude, 55.72% believed that the benefits of breastfeeding is only present in the infant being breastfed (A1), while 56.01% agreed that exclusive breastfeeding is achievable regardless of nipple conditions (A2). Additionally, 54.55% recognized the positive impact of longer breastfeeding duration on a child's growth and development (A3), and 54.84% acknowledged that formula-fed babies are more prone to overfeeding than breastfed babies (A4). Notably, 52.78% supported formula feeding as a practical choice for working mothers (A5). Furthermore, respondents emphasized the emotional significance of breastfeeding, with 58.5% considering it very important (A6) and 57.19% feeling emotionally close to their babies through breastfeeding (A7). A strong consensus (57.92%) affirmed that breastmilk is the ideal food for infants (A8), 58.23% expressed agreement that breastfed babies are healthier than formula-fed babies (A10). However, 28.89% thought that breastfeeding was a burden for them (A9). The importance of preventing lactational mastitis was highlighted by 58.51% (A11), 58.65% believed that most cases of lactational mastitis can be avoided (A12), and 59.09% expressed a willingness to acquire knowledge about preventing lactational mastitis (A14).

### A failed RCT to determine if antibiotics prevent mastitis: cracked nipples colonized with Staphylococcus aureus: a randomized treatment trial [^8313ba09]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2004). Low credibility.

Discussion

This trial experienced a number of problems, both foreseen and unforeseen. In the trial conducted by Livingstone and Stringer, there is no mention of women refusing to participate in the study or not taking the treatment they were allocated. It is not reported if any woman developed mastitis in the period between collection of the swab, the clinician receiving the result and the woman being given her allocated treatment regime – indeed the paper does not state that women had to return to the breastfeeding clinic for this. Possibly, women attending a breastfeeding clinic are more likely to comply with treatment regimes than women who are invited to participate in a trial.

We thought the estimate of 5% of breastfeeding women developing a cracked nipple was a conservative estimate. For example, in Western Australia, Duffy et al had found that 6% of women in their intervention group had cracked nipples, compared to 69% in their control group. However, on visiting the postnatal wards and breastfeeding clinics in inner Melbourne, it was not unusual to find that the staff were unable to identify any women with damaged nipples. And of the women who were assessed, more than half did not have a cracked nipple. Therefore, nipple damage appears to be uncommon in breastfeeding women in Melbourne.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^1f54e9eb]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric HIV — breastfeeding management and infant prophylaxis — Administer appropriate ARV prophylaxis starting at birth. If detectable viral load develops during breastfeeding, the Panels recommend that breastfeeding be temporarily stopped or discontinued and replacement feeding initiated, and additional infant ARV prophylaxis and infant testing are also recommended. Provide guidance on good breast care, promptly identify and treat mastitis, thrush, and cracked or bleeding nipples, and note that these conditions may increase the risk of HIV transmission through breastfeeding, although the impact of these conditions in the context of ART and viral suppression is unknown. Develop a joint plan for weaning with family and providers; since very rapid weaning was associated with increased risk of HIV shedding into breast milk and risk of transmission in the pre-ART era, weaning over a 2- to 4-week period might be safer with attention to breast care. There is little evidence to guide the infant HIV testing schedule during breastfeeding, and there have been transmissions detected many weeks or even months after reported cessation of breastfeeding.
