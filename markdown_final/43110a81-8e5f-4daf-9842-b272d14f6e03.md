## Question

Patient has BPH with obstruction that has caused subjective urinary retention in the past and asymptomatic urinary retention currently which has caused bilateral hydroureteronephrosis which has caused chronic renal failure. The reversibility of that is uncertain at this time. Patient was made aware of the fact that this is a chronic problem that will only get worse with time. What are his treatment options?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what treatment options are available for BPH-related bladder outlet obstruction with current asymptomatic urinary retention (previously subjective retention), bilateral hydroureteronephrosis, and chronic renal failure with uncertain reversibility. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the core clinical problem and whether renal insufficiency from BPH is an absolute indication for surgery. Then, I should verify what the major guidelines (AUA, EAU, CUA) say about indications for intervention in the context of upper tract damage. Next, I will review how to assess the reversibility of renal dysfunction and what diagnostic tests guide counseling. After that, I need to compare medical, minimally invasive, and definitive surgical options with attention to deobstructive efficacy and safety. Finally, I will integrate patient-specific factors, outline a multidisciplinary pathway, and state a bottom-line recommendation with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and why it matters: this patient has objective upper tract obstruction (bilateral hydroureteronephrosis) and chronic renal impairment attributable to BPH, even if current LUTS are not bothersome, which implies high-pressure chronic obstruction with end-organ involvement and mandates relief of obstruction regardless of symptom burden. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should verify that guidelines explicitly list renal insufficiency secondary to BPH as an absolute indication for surgery, and they do, which means watchful waiting or medical therapy alone is inappropriate when renal function is compromised [^112ZMJ5o].

> I should double-check guideline-based indications for surgery: the AUA explicitly recommends surgery in patients with renal insufficiency secondary to BPH, along with refractory retention, recurrent UTIs, stones or hematuria, or refractory bothersome LUTS, making this an unequivocal indication here. Let me verify cross-organization alignment: EAU guidance advises surgical treatment for complications of BPH including renal impairment, and the CUA supports definitive surgical options, including simple prostatectomy for very large glands in experienced centers, reinforcing that definitive BOO relief is indicated in this scenario [^112ZMJ5o] [^115tS9HD] [^111XaLZg].

> Next, I should review how to assess the reversibility of renal dysfunction to guide counseling and expectations. Wait, let me verify the work-up: obtain serum creatinine, eGFR, electrolytes and acid–base status for a baseline; use renal ultrasound (with Doppler) to reconfirm hydronephrosis and exclude alternative pathology; consider a diuretic renogram (MAG-3) for obstruction and split function to estimate salvageability. I need to be careful to explain that improvement after decompression depends on chronicity and cortical thinning; prolonged obstruction predisposes to irreversible tubulointerstitial fibrosis, so surgery can halt further decline and may improve eGFR, but recovery magnitude is uncertain and must be framed honestly in shared decision-making [^notfound].

> Let me think about medical therapy — could it ever be sufficient here. Hold on, I should verify: α-blockers and 5α-reductase inhibitors can reduce symptoms and progression risk in typical LUTS/BPH cohorts, but they do not reliably reverse established high-grade obstruction with renal compromise; thus, in this context, they serve as a bridge while planning surgery or optimizing comorbidities, not as the definitive strategy. I should confirm guidance: AUA and CUA endorse α-blockers first-line for symptomatic patients and combination therapy for progression risk, and EAU supports α-1 blockers and selected combinations, but no guideline endorses medical therapy alone for BOO with renal insufficiency, which aligns with proceeding to surgical relief here [^112ZMJ5o] [^113KWhdq] [^116VJAZ4] [^112ZMJ5o].

> I will now examine definitive deobstructive options and their relative efficacy and safety. I need to check that TURP remains a standard option with robust deobstructive effect; yes, AUA 2024 recommends TURP, and GreenLight PVP is appropriate especially when bleeding risk or anticoagulation is a concern, while HoLEP provides size-independent enucleation and the greatest measured reduction in BOOI in comparative analyses. But wait, what if the prostate is very large and endoscopic tissue removal would be inefficient — then simple prostatectomy (laparoscopic or robotic) in experienced centers is appropriate per CUA guidance, offering definitive relief, so the choice should be tailored to size, risk, and expertise [^114txRKe] [^113sEc1S] [^113vpnXo] [^111XaLZg].

> Hmm, wait a minute, should minimally invasive office-based options be considered first to avoid the OR. Let me verify their role: PAE, PUL, and Aquablation can improve LUTS and flow in selected populations, but evidence is limited in patients with established renal impairment where prompt and reliable decompression is crucial; relying on them risks delayed or incomplete relief. I should confirm that older thermal modalities like TUMT achieve delayed tissue necrosis and are not suitable for urgent decompression in upper tract compromise, supporting prioritization of definitive endoscopic or surgical relief here [^112KbExK] [^116ABxVn] [^111TBZ7W] [^116WaV8z].

> I need to ensure patient-specific modifiers are integrated into the procedural choice: prostate size steers toward simple prostatectomy when very large versus TURP, HoLEP, or PVP for moderate sizes; bleeding risk and anticoagulation favor PVP or bipolar/laser approaches; surgeon experience and institutional resources matter greatly for HoLEP and robotic simple prostatectomy; preservation of ejaculation is secondary to renal preservation in this context but can be discussed; and shared decision-making about risks, benefits, and the possibility of incomplete renal recovery is essential. Let me double-check that guidelines emphasize counseling and matching therapy to patient factors, which they do [^116Kkxd6] [^111XaLZg] [^111oa5FL].

> Next, I should review the multidisciplinary pathway to reduce perioperative risk and optimize renal outcomes. I need to check that early involvement of nephrology for volume, electrolyte, and BP optimization is appropriate; concurrent short-term α-blocker ± 5α-reductase inhibitor can be used as a bridge while scheduling surgery; procedural selection should follow size and risk profiles; and post-operative monitoring of renal function at approximately 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months guides expectations for recovery and ongoing nephrology care if CKD persists. Hold on, I should verify that the AUA medical and counseling guidance supports this staged approach, and internal medicine perspectives align with surgical referral when CKD is present due to BPH [^112P9cEV] [^111oa5FL] [^116pYjr5].

> Let me reconsider the overall hierarchy for this specific patient, just to be sure I'm not missing anything critical: watchful waiting is inappropriate because end-organ renal damage is already present; medical therapy alone risks ongoing obstruction and further decline; minimally invasive office therapies lack evidence for urgent, reliable decompression in renal failure; therefore, definitive transurethral or surgical deobstruction (TURP, PVP, HoLEP, or simple prostatectomy depending on size, bleeding risk, and expertise) is indicated now, with counseling that surgery halts progression and may improve eGFR but recovery is variable. I should confirm that this aligns with AUA indications for surgery in renal insufficiency and with EAU and CUA positions on managing complications of BPH and large-gland disease [^112ZMJ5o] [^116WaV8z] [^111XaLZg].

> Final recommendation and self-check: Proceed with definitive surgical relief of bladder outlet obstruction after brief medical optimization in partnership with nephrology, selecting among TURP, PVP, HoLEP, or simple prostatectomy per prostate size, bleeding risk, and local expertise; use α-blocker ± 5α-reductase inhibitor only as a short-term bridge if needed, and monitor renal function post-operatively to document any recovery. I should double-check that the deobstructive efficacy hierarchy and indications are supported, and they are, including evidence that HoLEP yields the greatest BOOI reduction and that TURP and PVP are guideline-endorsed standards for durable decompression in this setting [^114txRKe] [^113vpnXo] [^115Sri2T].

For BPH with chronic retention, hydroureteronephrosis, and CKD, **surgical intervention is indicated** [^112ZMJ5o] to relieve obstruction and prevent further renal decline. TURP is the **standard option** [^114txRKe], with HoLEP or PVP for large prostates or bleeding risk, and simple prostatectomy for very large glands [^111XaLZg]. Medical therapy (alpha-blockers, 5-ARIs) is adjunctive [^112P9cEV] and not definitive; minimally invasive options (PAE, Rezum, UroLift) are not appropriate in this setting. If surgery is contraindicated, **long-term catheterization** is the fallback. Early surgery offers the best chance to stabilize or improve renal function, though reversibility is uncertain.

---

## Medical management

Medical therapy is **adjunctive only** and does not relieve the underlying obstruction.

- **Alpha-blockers (e.g. tamsulosin, alfuzosin)**: Rapid symptom relief [^112KBL92] but do not reduce prostate size or prevent progression.

- **5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs, e.g. finasteride, dutasteride)**: Reduce prostate size and lower risk of AUR and surgery [^112kMwGY], but take months to work and are less effective in severe obstruction.

- **Combination therapy**: Alpha-blocker plus 5-ARI for moderate-to-severe LUTS with enlarged prostate [^115vsMSx], but not definitive in chronic retention with renal impairment [^112P9cEV].

- **Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (e.g. tadalafil)**: Modest symptom benefit [^116axiqu], mainly for concomitant erectile dysfunction [^112GjLSV].

---

## Minimally invasive procedures

Minimally invasive options are **not appropriate** for chronic retention with renal impairment.

- **Prostatic arterial embolization (PAE)**: Not recommended for chronic retention with renal impairment.

- **Water vapor thermal therapy (Rezum)**: Not suitable for chronic retention with renal impairment.

- **Prostatic urethral lift (UroLift)**: Not indicated for chronic retention with renal impairment.

---

## Surgical interventions

Surgery is the **definitive treatment** for chronic retention with renal impairment [^112ZMJ5o].

| **Surgical option** | **Indication** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|-|-|-|-|
| TURP | Standard for moderate-to-severe LUTS and chronic retention [^114txRKe] | Effective symptom relief; improved renal function | Bleeding; TUR syndrome; retrograde ejaculation |
| HoLEP | Large prostates (> 80 mL) | Effective [^113vpnXo]; low bleeding; short catheter time | Steep learning curve; specialized equipment |
| PVP (GreenLight laser) | Bleeding risk or anticoagulation [^113sEc1S] | Low bleeding; short catheter time | Limited tissue for pathology; retreatment risk |
| Simple prostatectomy | Very large prostates (> 100 mL) | Effective for large glands | Invasive; longer recovery |

---

## Catheterization

If surgery is contraindicated, **long-term catheterization** (indwelling or intermittent) decompresses the bladder and helps prevent further renal decline but carries risks of infection and discomfort.

---

## Reversibility of renal impairment

Renal recovery depends on obstruction duration, severity, and baseline renal function. **Early surgery** offers the best chance to stabilize or improve renal function, though reversibility remains uncertain.

---

## Patient counseling and shared decision-making

Patients should be counseled about the **progressive nature** of BPH [^113F8Bod], the risks of untreated obstruction, and the benefits and risks of each option, with shared decision-making guiding care [^111oa5FL].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up with **renal function tests, imaging, and symptom assessment** is essential to track progression and treatment response [^112P9cEV].

---

Surgical intervention is the **definitive treatment** for BPH with chronic retention, hydroureteronephrosis, and CKD; medical therapy is adjunctive, and minimally invasive options are not appropriate. Early surgery offers the best chance to stabilize or improve renal function, though reversibility is uncertain.

### Long-term results of medical treatment in benign prostatic hyperplasia [^116LbmK9]. Urology (2006). Low credibility.

In real-life clinical practice, the incidence of acute urinary retention (AUR) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)-related surgery was determined in patients with BPH who received an alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker (alpha-blocker) and/or a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor combination treatment.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study enrolled 341 patients with BPH who were prescribed an alpha-blocker and/or a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor as their first treatment from January 1997 to June 1999. Using follow-up data from a 6 to 8-year period, the incidence of AUR and BPH-related surgery was calculated in the alpha-blocker-only group and in the combination group.

- **Results**: Of the 341 patients, 192 were in the alpha-blocker group and 149 were in the combination group. Of these, 17.7% in the alpha-blocker group and 12.1% in the combination group experienced AUR (P < 0.05). BPH-related surgery was performed in 10.9% of the alpha-blocker-only group and 6.0% of the combination group (P < 0.05). The incidence of AUR and BPH-related surgery was reduced by 32.3% and 48.9% when the prostate volume was larger than 35 g and by 49.4% and 60.6% when the prostate-specific antigen level was greater than 2.0 ng/mL, respectively, in the combination group compared with the corresponding values in the alpha-blocker group.

- **Conclusions**: Real-life clinical practice showed that long-term combination treatment with alpha-blockers and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors reduced the risk of BPH progression, such as AUR or BPH-related surgery, compared with alpha-blocker-only treatment.

### Prostatic arterial embolization for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^112KbExK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

A variety of minimally invasive surgical approaches are available as an alternative to transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for the management of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Prostatic arterial embolization (PAE) is a relatively new, minimally invasive treatment approach.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of PAE compared to other procedures for the treatment of LUTS in men with BPH.

- **Search methods**: We performed a comprehensive search using multiple databases (The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar), trial registries, other sources of grey literature, and conference proceedings with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status, up until 25 September 2020.

- **Selection criteria**: We included parallel-group randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies (NRS, limited to prospective cohort studies with comparison groups) enrolling men over the age of 40 with LUTS attributed to BPH undergoing PAE versus TURP or other surgical interventions.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently classified studies for inclusion or exclusion and abstracted data from the included studies. We performed statistical analyses using a random-effects model and interpreted them according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We used GRADE guidance to rate the certainty of evidence of RCTs and NRSs.

- **Main results**: We found data to inform two comparisons: PAE versus TURP (six RCTs).

### Patient-centred care for the medical treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in patients with benign prostatic obstruction: a key point to improve patients' care - a systematic review [^114qJ288]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

In the last decades, evidence-based medicine (EBM) has been the cornerstone of clinical practice. Physicians' personal experience and expertise are often limited by several knowledge biases and gaps, thus EBM intends to ameliorate the decision-making process by collecting and summarizing evidence from well-designed and well-conducted clinical trials and developing and updating international, widely-accepted guidelines. Following this approach, a safer, more reliable, and more cost-effective clinical practice may be achieved.

Conversely, critics are concerned that the emphasis on EBM could undervalue the tacit knowledge that physicians accumulate through clinical experience. Additionally, they question whether results from designed research strictly apply to real patients, who often differ significantly from those included in clinical trials. Lastly, EBM frequently ignores patients' preferences and values, theoretically reducing their adherence to the proposed treatment.

### New innovative therapies for benign prostatic hyperplasia: any advance [^112yRGFE]. Current Opinion in Urology (2003). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to address benign prostatic hyperplasia, which is the most common human neoplasm and the most frequent tumor requiring surgical treatment in men. There is significant interest in understanding prostatic growth during aging and in exploring various medical or interventional treatments.

Recent publications have shed light on several key findings:

- **5α-reductase inhibitors**: There is an interaction of various 5α-reductase inhibitors on the two 5α-reductase isoforms type 1 and 2, providing potential new insight into the pathogenesis of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

- **Chronic inflammation**: Chronic inflammation increases growth patterns of fibromuscular tissue in benign prostatic hyperplasia, similar to wound healing, and a paracrine loop for chronic inflammation with overexpression of interleukin has been identified. This discovery could be crucial for further understanding of prostatic enlargement.

- **Herbal drug treatment**: It seems more effective than previously thought for lower urinary tract symptoms, with effectiveness well beyond placebo effects, according to recent publications.

- **Alpha-blockers**: They play an important role in treating lower urinary tract symptoms, with alpha-1 adrenoreceptor antagonists preventing cell proliferation and apoptotic imbalances in prostatic tissue. However, the effect of alpha-blockers may be limited by severe bladder outlet obstruction, putting patients at increased risk of treatment failure.

- **Alternative treatments**: Laser prostatectomy and microwave thermotherapy are being considered as alternative treatments for benign prostatic hyperplasia.

These findings contribute to the evolving understanding and treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

### Benign prostatic hyperplasia [^117AzJAp]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2016). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which causes lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), is a common diagnosis among the ageing male population with increasing prevalence. Many risk factors, both modifiable and non-modifiable, can increase the risk of development and progression of BPH and LUTS. The symptoms can be obstructive — resulting in urinary hesitancy, weak stream, straining, or prolonged voiding — or irritative, leading to increased urinary frequency and urgency, nocturia, urge incontinence, and reduced voiding volumes. Symptoms may also affect the patient after micturition, such as postvoid dribble or incomplete emptying.

BPH occurs when both stromal and epithelial cells of the prostate in the transitional zone proliferate by processes that are thought to be influenced by inflammation and sex hormones, causing prostate enlargement. Patients with LUTS undergo several key diagnostic investigations before being diagnosed with BPH. Treatment options for men with BPH begin with watchful waiting and progress through medical to surgical interventions. For the majority of patients, the starting point on the treatment pathway will be dictated by their symptoms and degree of bother.

### Update - Canadian Urological Association guideline: Male lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia [^1178Whrn]. Canadian Urological Association Journal (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for benign prostatic hyperplasia, more specifically concerning combination therapy, the CUA 2022 guidelines suggest offering α-blockers combined with an anti-muscarinic or β-3 agonist for the treatment of LUTS/BPH in patients with both voiding and storage symptoms and failure of α-blocker monotherapy.

### Comparative effectiveness of newer medications for lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112dm3JA]. European Urology (2017). Low credibility.

- **Context**: Alpha-blockers (ABs) and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors have an established role in treating male lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Recently, newer drugs have shown promise for this indication.

- **Objective**: To assess the comparative effectiveness and adverse effects (AEs) of newer drugs to treat LUTS attributed to BPH through a systematic review and meta-analysis.

- **Evidence acquisition**: Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Ovid Embase bibliographic databases (through June 2016) were hand-searched for references of relevant studies. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials published in English of newer ABs, antimuscarinics, a beta-3 adrenoceptor agonist, phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors, or combination therapy with one of these medications as an active comparator. Observational studies of the same agents with a duration of ≥ 1 year that reported AEs were also included.

- **Evidence synthesis**: We synthesized evidence from 43 randomized controlled trials as well as five observational studies. Based on the improvement of mean International Prostate Symptom Score and quality of life scores, the effectiveness of the newer ABs was not different from the older ABs (moderate strength of evidence [SOE]), but had more AEs (low SOE). Antimuscarinics/AB combination therapy had similar outcomes as AB monotherapy (all moderate SOE), but often had more AEs. Phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors alone or in combination with ABs had similar or inferior outcomes than ABs alone. Evidence was insufficient.

### Patient's adherence on pharmacological therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)-associated lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) is different: is combination therapy better than monotherapy [^113YLWLk]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

From the initial cohort of about 6.5 million individuals, men aged ≥ 40 years totaled 1,447,074. Among these, only 28,273 received prescriptions for 12 months for BPH-associated LUTS, forming our study cohort, which was followed for a median period of 4 years (IQR 2–5.3).

- **Patient characteristics**: ABs was the most frequently prescribed drug class (87.1%), followed by 5ARIs (8.1%) and CT (4.7%), the latter being prescribed to older patients.

- **Drug adherence**: Patients who received prescriptions for ≥ 6 months were 97,407, which decreased to 61,298 (63%) at 10 months, and to 28,273 (29%) at 12 months. The continuation rates for ABs, 5ARIs, and CT at 12 months were 35%, 18%, and 9%, respectively, decreasing to 15%, 8%, and 3% at 60 months. In men who received drug prescriptions for at least 12 months, the 5-year adherence was 42%. Only 13% of patients remained under pharmacological therapy for the entire follow-up period (median 4 years).

- **Discontinuation rates**: Patients under CT showed a higher discontinuation rate throughout the follow-up period.

### EAU guidelines on benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) [^116WaV8z]. European Urology (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to establish guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

- **Methods**: A search of published work was conducted using Medline. In combination with expert opinions, recommendations were made on the usefulness of tests for assessment and follow-up: mandatory, recommended, or optional. In addition, indications and outcomes for the different therapeutic options were reviewed.

- **Results**: A digital rectal examination is mandatory in the assessment for the diagnosis of BPH. Recommended tests include the International Prostate Symptom Score, creatinine measurement (or renal ultrasound), uroflowmetry, and postvoid residual urine volume. All other tests are optional. The aim of treatment is to improve patients' quality of life, depending on the severity of BPH symptoms. The watchful waiting policy is recommended for patients with mild symptoms, medical treatment for patients with mild to moderate symptoms, and surgery for patients who failed medication or conservative management and who have moderate to severe symptoms and/or complications of BPH requiring surgery. Regarding non-surgical treatments, transurethral microwave thermotherapy is the most attractive option. These treatments should be reserved for patients who prefer to avoid surgery or who no longer respond favorably to medication. Finally, recommendations for follow-up tests and a recommended follow-up time schedule after BPH treatment are provided.

- **Conclusions**: Recommendations for assessment, possible therapeutic options, and follow-up of patients with BPH are made.

### Minimally invasive treatments for benign prostatic enlargement: Systematic review of randomised controlled trials [^115tS9HD]. BMJ (2008). High credibility.

Benign prostatic enlargement is the most common cause of lower urinary tract symptoms, such as frequent urination and a slow stream, which are highly prevalent among older men. Endoscopic removal of the inner part of the gland via transurethral resection of the prostate has long been considered the most effective treatment, with approximately 20,000 procedures performed in 2007 in the United Kingdom. This procedure has known disadvantages, including blood loss and physiological stress, which can affect recovery in some men. Additionally, it requires high levels of technical skill and necessitates a three to five-day hospital stay. These factors have encouraged the development of alternative treatments, including drugs, minimally invasive surgical techniques, and other forms of endoscopic prostatectomy, aiming to achieve the same level of symptom improvement but with less morbidity and lower costs.

Minimally invasive techniques aim to reduce prostate volume by inducing delayed tissue necrosis using relatively low levels of thermal energy, thereby reducing the risk of morbidity related to treatment. We conducted a systematic review to summarize evidence of benefits and risks for seven promising minimally invasive technologies compared to transurethral resection, using data from randomized controlled trials.

### Eliciting preferences for drug treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^112BzD8D]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

There are two main medical preparations available for lower urinary tract symptoms resulting from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Choosing between an alpha-blocker and a 5alpha-reductase inhibitor requires trade-offs between their attributes or characteristics. We investigated the relative importance of and trade-offs between the attributes of the 5alpha-reductase inhibitor, dutasteride, and alpha-blockers in community-dwelling men using a validated technique.

A discrete choice experiment was administered to 211 men older than 40 years who were randomly selected from the general United Kingdom population. Attributes investigated in the discrete choice experiment included time to symptom improvement, sexual and nonsexual side effects, the risks of acute urinary retention (AUR) and surgery, cost, and prostate size decrease. Using regression analysis, the relative importance of these attributes, the trade-offs that men are willing to make between these attributes, and the willingness to pay for each attribute were estimated.

All attributes were important to respondents. The most important attribute was side effects. The least preferred side effect was impotence, followed by decreased libido and dizziness. Respondents were willing to wait 13, 2, and 8 months longer for symptom improvement in exchange for decreased prostate size and the risks of AUR and surgery, respectively. Men reporting moderate symptoms were less concerned about sexual side effects, time to symptom improvement, and the risk of AUR compared with men reporting mild symptoms.

### Naftopidil for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms compatible with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^1113E3NF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common condition in ageing men that may cause lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Treatment aims are to relieve symptoms and prevent disease-related complications. Naftopidil is an alpha-blocker (AB) that has a high affinity for the A1d receptor, which may have advantages in treating LUTS in this setting. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2009. Since that time, several large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been reported, making this update relevant.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of naftopidil for the treatment of LUTS associated with BPH.

- **Search methods**: We performed a comprehensive search using multiple databases (the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, LILAC, and Web of Science), trials registries, other sources of grey literature, and conference proceedings with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status up to 31 May 2018.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all parallel RCTs. We also included cross-over design trials.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently classified and abstracted data from the included studies. We performed statistical analyses using a random-effects model and interpreted them according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Primary outcomes were urological symptom scores, quality of life (QoL), and treatment withdrawals for any reason. Secondary outcomes were treatment withdrawals due to adverse events, acute urinary retention, surgical intervention for BPH, and cardiovascular and s

### Bladder outlet obstruction relief and symptom improvement following medical and surgical therapies for lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia: A systematic review [^113vpnXo]. European Urology (2024). High credibility.

Symptomatic benefit and urodynamic obstruction relief represent relevant outcomes of therapies for lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (LUTS/BPH). We summarized evidence from studies concurrently assessing variations in terms of symptom severity and invasive urodynamic measures of obstruction following medical and surgical therapies for LUTS/BPH.

- **Methods**: We performed a systematic review of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science in June 2023.

- **Key findings and limitations**: We identified 29 publications: 14 (872 patients) and 15 (851 patients) studies addressing medical and surgical therapies, respectively. The mean percentage total International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) improvements ranged from -2.5% to 56.3% and from 35.1% to 82.1% following medical and surgical therapies, respectively. The corresponding mean percentage Bladder Outlet Obstruction Index (BOOI) improvements ranged from 7.8% to 53.5% and from 22.4% to 138.6%, respectively. Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) provided IPSS improvements in the higher range and the greatest BOOI reduction.

- **Conclusions and clinical implications**: Globally, based on available evidence, more pronounced symptomatic benefits are observed following treatments providing greater deobstructive effect. In detail, patients undergoing surgery exhibit greater IPSS and BOOI improvements than those receiving medical therapy.

### The progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia: Examining the evidence and determining the risk [^113F8Bod]. European Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is often associated with enlargement of the prostate gland, lower urinary tract symptoms, decreased urinary flow, and a reduced quality of life. Furthermore, if the symptoms associated with BPH are left untreated, serious complications, such as acute urinary retention, may ensue. Evidence is emerging from long-term clinical studies to suggest that BPH is a progressive disease, with some patients progressing much more rapidly than others.

- **Objective**: This article aims to explore the natural history of BPH progression from a molecular, pathological, and clinical perspective, with an emphasis on the key clinical evidence to support the progressive nature of this disease. How our increased understanding of the disease and the risk factors for BPH progression might be applied to improve management practices are also discussed.

- **Conclusion**: Strategies to identify patients most at risk and guidelines directed towards long-term management, in addition to short-term treatment, may be useful in helping to prevent BPH progression.

### How would you manage this patient with benign prostatic hyperplasia? Grand rounds discussion from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center [^116pYjr5]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) are common in older patients assigned male sex at birth, regardless of gender identity, and treatment of these symptoms is therefore common in primary care practice. In 2021, the American Urological Association published guidelines for the management of BPH. They recommend using a standardized scoring system such as the International Prostate Symptom Score to help establish a diagnosis and to monitor the efficacy of interventions. α-blockers are suggested as the first-choice pharmacotherapy option, and 5α-reductase inhibitors are recommended for patients with a prostate size estimated to be at least 30 cc. Tadalafil is another option regardless of erectile dysfunction.

Combination therapies with α-blockers and 5α-reductase inhibitors, anticholinergic agents, or β3-agonists are effective options. A surgical referral is warranted if the BPH results in chronic kidney disease, refractory urinary retention, recurrent urinary tract infections, if there is concern for bladder or prostate cancer, or if symptoms do not respond to medical therapy. In this article, a general internal medicine physician and a urologist discuss the treatment options and how they would apply their recommendations to a patient who wishes to learn more about his options.

### New medical treatments for lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia and future perspectives [^116NFyzQ]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

The National Library of Medicine Database was searched for relevant articles published between January 2006 and December 2015. A comprehensive search included the combination of the following words: "BPH", "LUTS", "medical", and "new". While recent articles were prioritized, manuscripts with relevant historical findings were referenced if necessary. Publications in the English language were preferred. However, if necessary, data was extrapolated from manuscripts in other languages. Evidence was not limited to human data; results from animal and in vitro experiments were also included in the review. Helsinki Declaration principles were respected, and informed consent was obtained. Each article's title, abstract, and text were reviewed for appropriateness and relevance. The initial list of selected papers was enriched by individual suggestions from the authors of the present review. Overall, 148 articles were reviewed. Of these, 92 were excluded after screening by the authors, leaving 56 articles eligible for the review.

### Tamsulosin for benign prostatic hyperplasia [^111wi7wJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a nonmalignant enlargement of the prostate which can result in bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms. The treatment goal for men with BPH is to relieve these bothersome symptoms.

- **Objectives**: This systematic review assessed the effects of tamsulosin in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) compatible with BPH.

- **Search strategy**: Trials were searched in computerized general and specialized databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library), by checking bibliographies, and by contacting manufacturers and researchers.

- **Selection criteria**: Trials were eligible if they (1) randomized men with BPH to receive tamsulosin in comparison with placebo, other BPH medications, or surgical interventions, (2) included clinical outcomes such as urologic symptom scales, symptoms, or urodynamic measurements, and (3) had a treatment duration of 30 days or longer. Eligibility was assessed by at least two independent observers.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Information on patients, interventions, and outcomes were extracted by at least two independent reviewers using a standard form. The main outcome measure for comparing the effectiveness of tamsulosin with placebo, medical, or surgical interventions was the change in urologic symptom scale scores. Secondary outcomes included changes in urinary flow measures (peak urine flow rate). The main outcome measure for adverse effects was the number of men reporting adverse effects.

- **Main results**: Fourteen studies involving 4,122 subjects met inclusion criteria. Study duration ranged from 4-

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia: AUA guideline part I-initial work-up and medical management [^112P9cEV]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a histologic diagnosis describing the proliferation of smooth muscle and epithelial cells within the prostatic transition zone. The prevalence and severity of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in aging men are progressive and significantly impact public health. This revised guideline provides a valuable reference for the effective evidence-based management of male LUTS/BPH. See the accompanying algorithm for a summary of the procedures detailed in the guideline.

- **Materials and methods**: The Minnesota Evidence Review Team conducted searches in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, and AHRQ databases to identify eligible English language studies published between January 2008 and April 2019, later updated through December 2020. Search terms included Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and keywords related to pharmacological therapies, drug classes, and LUTS or BPH. When sufficient evidence was available, the body of evidence received a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low) to support strong, moderate, or conditional recommendations. In the absence of sufficient evidence, information is provided as clinical principles and expert opinions.

- **Results**: Nineteen guideline statements related to evaluation, work-up, and medical management were developed. Appropriate levels of evidence and supporting text were created to guide primary care and urologic providers toward streamlined and suitable practices.

- **Conclusions**: The work-up and medical management guidance provided in this document aim to improve the treatment and care of patients with BPH.

### Recent developments in guidelines on benign prostatic hyperplasia [^114hWYUz]. Current Opinion in Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Guidelines within the healthcare system aim to rationalize the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of a particular disease. They can be applicable on an international scale or may be country-specific. Specialists, who determine the clinical evidence for individual practices, prepare these guidelines, and the strength of these recommendations depends on the available evidence. The assessment of patients includes a minimal number of non-invasive tests. Only in cases of abnormalities are additional, more invasive tests recommended. Treatment decisions should be evidence-based, but despite the availability of guidelines, the choice of treatment is often highly dependent on the personal preference of the urologist. Patients' awareness of different treatment options and their involvement in choosing a treatment is also increasing. Economic aspects are becoming more important in making healthcare decisions. Data on the durability of treatments, however, are limited and deserve special attention to provide the most cost-effective care for different patient groups.

### Lower urinary tract symptom: still too much focus on the prostate [^115FLN7v]. Current Opinion in Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Male patients with lower urinary tract symptoms have historically been managed in a prostate-centric fashion. Population studies highlighting the prevalence and significance of storage symptoms, including nocturia, have led to a shift in the way men with lower urinary tract symptoms are assessed and managed. We review the recent guidelines and publications that have addressed this change in approach.

- **Recent findings**: A new β-3 adrenoreceptor agonist has demonstrated significant improvement in storage symptoms and appears to be well tolerated.

- **Summary**: We support a continued move towards patient-focused management using the guidelines.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of new surgical treatments for benign prostatic hyperplasia: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115XCuyY]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

The strength of our study is that we simultaneously compared nine different surgical treatments for benign prostatic hyperplasia using a network meta-analysis. We compared Qmax and IPSS values at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after surgical treatment to evaluate the short- to mid-term effects of different treatments. Additionally, we included randomized controlled trials without language restrictions to avoid bias.

However, our network meta-analysis had some limitations. Firstly, complications were rare, and some trials reported zero events, resulting in a less precise estimation of the pooled odds ratio. Nevertheless, heterogeneity was low and also favored new methods in pairwise comparisons. Secondly, functional outcomes were assessed blindly in only 14% of trials, which could have led to bias in favor of the new methods. High heterogeneity was evident in many comparisons of primary outcomes. Initial prostate volume, degree of urodynamic obstruction, and surgeon experience could account for this high heterogeneity of functional outcomes. Thirdly, we did not analyze early postoperative urinary symptoms such as dysuria, urgency, or post-micturition pain. Although these symptoms affect short-term patient satisfaction, they typically improve with drug treatment by two to three months after surgical treatment.

Lastly, we did not differentiate vapo-enucleation from enucleation because the definition and technique are not standardized. Hence, differences in outcomes between vapo-enucleation and enucleation or different enucleation methods require further investigation.

### 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors: What's new [^115RsqJo]. Current Opinion in Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Medical therapy is now the first-line treatment for most men with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia. This review aims to highlight the recent contributions to our understanding of 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor usage.

- **Recent findings**: For the last decade, finasteride has been the only available 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor, acting upon the type 2 isoenzyme of 5-alpha reductase. Dutasteride is the first drug that can inhibit both isoenzymes and is soon to be available. Biochemically, it achieves greater and more rapid dihydrotestosterone suppression compared with finasteride. Clinically, it appears to be at least as good in terms of improving symptoms and flow rates, and reducing the risk of acute urinary retention or the requirement for benign prostatic hyperplasia-related surgery. However, until these two drugs are formally compared, the true benefits of additional type 1 isoenzyme inhibition are unknown. The recently reported Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms trial has convincingly demonstrated superior outcomes with combination therapy compared with monotherapy, unlike previous trials of shorter duration. The ability of 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors to prevent disease progression was also confirmed. Newer roles for 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors are also being defined. Finasteride has been shown to reduce and control benign prostatic hyperplasia-related haematuria, although its value in controlling perioperative bleeding is less clear. Their role as chemopreventive agents for prostate cancer is also under investigation.

### Update on AUA guideline on the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^114qQbtX]. The Journal of Urology (2011). Low credibility.

The purpose of this research was to revise the 2003 version of the American Urological Association's (AUA) guideline on the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Materials and methods included MEDLINE® searches of English-language publications from January 1999 through February 2008, using relevant MeSH terms. Articles concerning the management of the index patient — a male aged 45 years or older consulting a healthcare provider for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) — were identified. A qualitative analysis of the evidence was performed. Selected studies were stratified by design, comparator, follow-up interval, and intensity of intervention. Meta-analyses (quantitative synthesis) of outcomes from randomized controlled trials were planned. Guideline statements were drafted by an appointed expert panel based on the evidence.

The results indicated that the studies varied regarding patient selection, randomization, blinding mechanisms, run-in periods, patient demographics, comorbidities, prostate characteristics and symptoms, drug doses, other intervention characteristics, comparators, rigor and intervals of follow-up, trial duration and timing, suspected lack of applicability to US practice, and techniques of outcomes measurement. These variations affected the quality of the evidence reviewed, making formal meta-analysis impractical or futile. Instead, the panel and extractors reviewed the data systematically without statistical rigor. Diagnosis and treatment algorithms were adopted from the 2005 International Consultation of Urologic Diseases. Guide statements concerning pharmacotherapies were developed.

### The evaluation of nocturia in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia and the analysis of the curative effect after medical or placebo therapy for nocturia: a randomized placebo-controlled study [^1143UiBf]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

In the indices of age, 24-hour drinking volume, bladder function, prostate volume (PV), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, there were no significant differences between the NP group and the non-NP group. However, regarding lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) duration, nocturnal urine volume, morning urine volume, and daytime voiding frequency, the differences between the two groups were statistically significant.

### Enhanced clinical decisions for management of benign prostatic hyperplasia using patient-reported outcomes: Protocol for a prospective observational study [^1145BJDE]. BMC Urology (2024). Low credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) attributable to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) are common, affecting approximately 33% of Medicare beneficiaries. BPH is the most common condition contributing to non-neurogenic LUTS in men and is the focus of frequently updated medical and surgical management guidelines that directly influence provider decision-making and patient care. The burden of LUTS/BPH is expected to increase, both in the US and worldwide, due to shifting demographics and a static urologic workforce. To meet this demand, there is an urgent need to develop and refine efficient strategies to assess, triage, and enhance the care of patients through standardized outcome measures and optimized care coordination, including remote assessment.

Measuring outcomes provides a way to track progress, adjust treatments, monitor quality of care, and help patients achieve optimal outcomes. For decades, the American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA-SI) has been the patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure used in men with BPH, as recommended in the "Surgical Management" guidelines updated as recently as 2023. The AUA-SI, however, has several limitations that leave room for improvement. First, the AUA-SI omits urinary incontinence and pain, which in the Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN) cohort, were present in 51% and 17% of treatment-seeking men, respectively, despite exclusion of men with infection or urinary pain as a primary complaint. Issues such as urgency urinary incontinence, stress urinary incontinence, and post-void dribbling further highlight areas for potential enhancement.

### EAU guidelines on non-neurogenic male lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) [^112EhhnK]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for benign prostatic hyperplasia, specifically in the context of managing urinary incontinence through surgical interventions, the EAU 2025 guidelines emphasize informing patients about the high risk of complications. This includes potential mechanical failure and the possibility of explantation when receiving artificial urinary sphincter or adjustable continence therapy, despite the potential for achieving a cure.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia: AUA guideline part II-surgical evaluation and treatment [^112XSMDa]. The Journal of Urology (2021). Low credibility.

Surgical therapies for symptomatic bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) are diverse, ranging from minimally invasive office-based to high-cost operative approaches. This guideline presents effective evidence-based surgical management of male lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to or attributed to BPH (LUTS/BPH). An accompanying algorithm provides a detailed summary of procedures (figure: see text).

The Minnesota Evidence Review Team searched Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, and AHRQ databases to identify eligible studies published between January 2007 and September 2020, including the initial publication (2018) and amendments (2019, 2020). The team also reviewed articles identified by guideline panel members. When sufficient evidence was available, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low), supporting strong, moderate, or conditional recommendations. In the absence of sufficient evidence, information is provided as clinical principles and expert opinions (table: see text).

Twenty-four guideline statements relevant to pre-operative and surgical management were developed. Appropriate levels of evidence and supporting text were created to guide urologic providers toward suitable and safe operative interventions for individual patient characteristics. A re-treatment section was established to emphasize the longevity and outcomes associated with individual approaches to aid in patient counseling and therapeutic decisions.

### EAU guidelines on non-neurogenic male lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) [^116axiqu]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for benign prostatic hyperplasia, more specifically concerning combination therapy, EAU 2025 guidelines recommend offering combination treatment with an α-1 blocker and a PDE5 inhibitor in patients with bothersome LUTS, particularly in those willing to improve their erectile function. Inform the patients that the magnitude of the effect is modest.

### Surgical treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic obstruction: An analysis and meta-synthesis of available guidelines [^112SW85h]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms, supposedly secondary to benign prostatic obstruction (LUTS/BPO), are among the most prevalent conditions in older males. Surgical treatment is usually recommended if pharmacotherapy fails, is not well tolerated, or when BPO-related complications arise. Surgical options can also be used at an earlier stage following a thorough joint decision has been made. As established surgical therapies have drawbacks and the threshold for surgical treatment seems to have become much lower with the implementation of minimally invasive treatments (MITs), LUTS/BPO surgery has become an economically significant area. Consequently, novel therapeutic devices and procedures are being developed at an unprecedented rate.

The rapid adoption of new surgical techniques is influenced by a range of factors, including patient demand, competitive healthcare dynamics, and regulatory pathways that are often less stringent than those applied to pharmaceuticals. Consequently, some interventions may enter clinical use before a comprehensive evidence base is available. A comprehensive understanding of the array of procedures, including their benefits and risks, safety profiles, and ideal indications, is essential for successful, individualized treatment. However, for physicians not deeply specialized in the field, staying abreast of these developments can be challenging. Clinical guidelines provide critical support in this context.

Nonetheless, guidelines are not without their limitations. The required level of evidence for recommending novel treatments is not uniformly defined.

### Sexual function in patients treated for benign prostatic hyperplasia [^116QufvG]. Lancet (2003). Low credibility.

The effect of different treatment options for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) on sexual function or dysfunction is an important consideration, especially given the prevalence of sexual dysfunction and BPH with increasing age. Some treatments for BPH can significantly affect sexual function. Different surgical treatments have varying effects on sexual function depending on the extent to which the internal involuntary sphincter is affected. Similarly, medical therapies have distinctive impacts, as each class of drug uniquely affects sexual function.

In past studies, many articles suggested a causal relationship between BPH and sexual dysfunction. However, a recent report by H. Leliefeld and colleagues confirms that this relationship is coincidental. These investigators conducted a prospective examination of patients at baseline and again nine months after undergoing various BPH treatments. The study utilized questionnaires to assess voiding symptoms, related complications, and sexual function. Findings indicated that 84% of patients reported no change in their sexual function. Improvement and deterioration were observed in 3–14% and 0–16% of patients, respectively. Age was confirmed as the most significant determinant of sexual function.

Additionally, severe irritative symptoms and the presence of urological comorbidity, such as bladder stones, increased the incidence of sexual dysfunction. In this study, most participants underwent surgical therapy or opted for watchful waiting, while fewer received medical therapy. The number of patients undergoing minimally invasive procedures was too small to allow for substantial comments on their effect on sexual function. Thus, the relationship between BPH treatment and sexual function remains complex and influenced by multiple factors.

### Surgical management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia: AUA guideline amendment 2019 [^116Ahkza]. The Journal of Urology (2019). High credibility.

Male lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) are common in men and can negatively affect quality of life (QoL). This guideline aims to be a reference for effective, evidence-based surgical management of LUTS/BPH.

The evidence team searched Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality database to identify studies indexed between January 2007 and September 2017. Following initial publication, this guideline was amended in 2019 and reflects relevant literature published through January 2019. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low) to support Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In the absence of sufficient evidence, additional information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions (see supplementary unabridged guideline).

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations regarding the management of LUTS/BPH through surgery and minimally invasive surgical therapies (MIST). Additional statements address diagnostic and pre-operative tests. Clinical statements are compared to what is generally accepted as the gold standard, such as transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), both monopolar and bipolar. This guideline is designed to be used with the associated treatment algorithm.

### Update - Canadian Urological Association guideline: Male lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia [^113TLT49]. Canadian Urological Association Journal (2022). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of benign prostatic hyperplasia, specifically concerning beta-3 agonists, the CUA 2022 guidelines suggest offering β-3 agonists to patients with BPH who predominantly exhibit storage symptoms. Exercise caution when using these in patients with significant bladder outlet obstruction and/or an elevated post-void residual volume.

### Effect of dutasteride on clinical progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia in asymptomatic men with enlarged prostate: A post hoc analysis of the REDUCE study [^117Rk74t]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia commonly causes lower urinary tract symptoms among men as they age. The treatment of this progressive condition is often adjusted for prostate size. Progression of prostatic hyperplasia is defined as an aggregate measure of worsening lower urinary tract symptoms, acute urinary retention, and the need for prostate surgery. Pivotal phase III trials such as Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) and Combination of Avodart and Tamsulosin (ComBAT) have shown that combination medical therapy with a 5α-reductase inhibitor and α-blocker can halt the progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia among men with moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms, with the greatest benefit noted in men with enlarged prostates.

An important aspect of both of these trials, as well as other studies showing the preventive benefits of 5α-reductase inhibitors, is that they have excluded men with mild lower urinary tract symptoms at screening (MTOPS excluded International Prostate Severity Scale (IPSS) scores < 8). Consequently, it is unknown whether 5α-reductase inhibitors have similar beneﬁts in men with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic enlarged prostate. The cumulative incidence rates of the primary endpoint and secondary endpoint events for men with prostate sizes > 30 mL were 4.2 (95% confidence interval 2.2 to 8.2) and 2.3 (1.1 to 4.7), respectively, while the unadjusted relative risk of acute urinary retention for prostate size > 30 mL was 4.1 (2.0 to 8.6) compared with men with prostate size ≤ 30 mL.

### Phosphodiesterase inhibitors for lower urinary tract symptoms consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^112GjLSV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) refers to non-malignant enlargement of the prostate gland that may cause bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Alpha-blockers (ABs) and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) are the mainstay of medical treatment. Recently, phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDEIs), primarily used for erectile dysfunction, have been introduced for the treatment of male LUTS.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of PDEIs compared to placebo and other standard care drugs (ABs and 5-ARIs) in men with LUTS consistent with BPH.

- **Search methods**: A systematic search was conducted using the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and clinical trials registries from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This search was updated on 2 August 2018. Additional citation tracking and handsearching of abstracts and conference proceedings were performed. Study authors were contacted for further information.

- **Selection criteria**: The review included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PDEIs versus placebo, ABs, or 5-ARIs for at least four weeks in men with BPH-LUTS.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three review authors independently screened the literature and extracted data. The primary outcomes were measured in terms of effects on urinary symptoms, as assessed by the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS-total; score ranges from 0 to 35, with higher values indicating more symptoms), and urinary bother as assessed by the Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Impact Index (BPH).

### Evaluation and treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in older men [^113xiBSh]. The Journal of Urology (2009). Low credibility.

The 6th International Consultation on New Developments in Prostate Cancer and Prostate Diseases convened from June 24–28, 2005, in Paris, France, to examine advancements in benign prostatic disease.

A series of committees were tasked with producing recommendations on the evaluation and treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in older men. Each committee was required to base recommendations on a comprehensive assessment of the available literature, following the International Consultation on Incontinence's level of evidence and grading system, adapted from the Oxford system.

The Consultation endorsed the appropriate use of the terms "lower urinary tract symptoms", "benign prostatic hyperplasia", "benign prostate enlargement", and "benign prostatic obstruction". It recommended abandoning terms like "clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia" or "the benign prostatic hyperplasia patient" and advised authorities to adopt the new nomenclature.

- **Diagnostic evaluation**: The focus is on the impact (bother) of lower urinary tract symptoms on the individual patient when determining investigation and treatment. The importance of symptom assessment, impact on quality of life, physical examination, and urinalysis is emphasized.
- **Frequency volume chart**: Recommended when nocturia is a bothersome symptom to exclude nocturnal polyuria.

The recommendations are encapsulated in two algorithms: one for basic management and one for specialized management of persistent, bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms.

### Landmarks in BPH — from aetiology to medical and surgical management [^113uWcTV]. Nature Reviews Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Clinicians treat the symptoms associated with BPH on a daily basis. Although BPH is nearly universal with age, not all men develop lower urinary tract symptoms. Over the past 100 years, several notable advances in the field of urology have not only improved our understanding of the aetiology and natural history of this common disease, but have also facilitated the development of therapeutics to effectively manage BPH-related symptoms. The high quality of modern-day diagnosis, as well as medical and surgical treatment for BPH, is a testimony to centuries of observation and decades of scientific research.

### EAU guidelines on non-neurogenic male lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) [^113kE4hQ]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

The EAU 2025 guidelines on medical management for benign prostatic hyperplasia, particularly regarding the management of urinary incontinence through other therapeutic interventions, recommend informing patients about the limited duration of response to botulinum toxin injections. Patients should also be made aware of the risk of urinary tract infections (UTI) and the possible prolonged need for clean intermittent self-catheterization, ensuring they are both willing and able to perform this procedure.

### Perspective of botox for treatment of male lower urinary tract symptoms [^112rwAew]. Current Opinion in Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) are frequently encountered in aging men. The medical treatment for lower urinary tract symptoms/BPH is not totally effective or without side effects. The use of transurethral resection of the prostate, the 'gold standard' surgical intervention for BPH, is progressively changing to minimally invasive surgical therapies, but none of them has provided clear long-term results without complications. Thus, there has been much interest in developing alternative treatments, such as the injection of botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) into the prostate.

- **Recent findings**: There are two main factors that contribute to lower urinary tract symptoms in BPH: excessive growth (static component) and increase in smooth muscle tone (dynamic component). BTX-A seems to be the first therapeutic agent to target both factors. Its use inhibits the autonomic efferent effects on prostate growth and contraction and also inhibits the abnormal afferent effects on prostate sensation. BTX-A injected into the prostate appears to be well tolerated and effective.

- **Summary**: Although clinical series demonstrate efficacy for a minimum of 6 months, more studies are necessary to identify the mechanisms by which BTX-A affects the prostate, the ideal dose, and the duration of effect. BTX-A use in prostate disease is currently 'off-label'.

### Future concepts in the medical therapy of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^112Mor4o]. Current Opinion in Urology (2001). Low credibility.

The standard medical therapy for symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia remains alpha-blockers and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors. Ongoing studies demonstrate the long-term safety and efficacy of these two classes of therapeutic approaches. Although there have been no new Food and Drug Administration-approved medical therapies for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia over the past year, interest in and the use of phytotherapeutic agents continues to increase. In this review, we discuss the developments that have occurred over the past year in the medical management of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Additionally, we present ongoing efforts at our center to obtain a better understanding of and manipulate the apoptotic pathway as it pertains to the pathophysiology of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

### Evaluation and treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in older men [^113tjqza]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

- **Purpose**: The 6th International Consultation on New Developments in Prostate Cancer and Prostate Diseases met from June 24–28, 2005, in Paris, France, to review new developments in benign prostatic disease.

- **Materials and methods**: A series of committees were tasked with producing recommendations on the evaluation and treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in older men. Each committee based its recommendations on a thorough assessment of the available literature using the International Consultation on Incontinence level of evidence and grading system adapted from the Oxford system.

- **Results**: The Consultation endorsed the appropriate use of the terminology "lower urinary tract symptoms", "benign prostatic hyperplasia", "benign prostate enlargement", and "benign prostatic obstruction". It recommended abandoning terms such as "clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia" and "the benign prostatic hyperplasia patient", urging authorities to endorse the new nomenclature. The diagnostic evaluation describes recommended and optional tests, generally focusing on the impact (bother) of lower urinary tract symptoms on the individual patient when determining investigation and treatment. Emphasis is placed on the importance of symptom assessment, quality of life impact, physical examination, and urinalysis. The frequency volume chart is recommended when nocturia is a bothersome symptom, to exclude nocturnal polyuria. The recommendations are summarized in two algorithms: one for basic management and one for specialized management of persistent bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms.

### Prostatic urethral lift for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^116ABxVn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

A variety of minimally invasive surgical approaches are available as an alternative to transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for the management of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). A recent addition to these is the prostatic urethral lift (PUL).

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of PUL for the treatment of LUTS in men with BPH.

- **Search methods**: We performed a comprehensive search of multiple databases, including the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. We also searched trial registries, other sources of grey literature, and conference proceedings. There were no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status up until 31 January 2019.

- **Selection criteria**: We included parallel group randomized controlled trials (RCTs). While we planned to include non-RCTs if RCTs had provided low-certainty evidence for a given outcome and comparison, we could not find any non-RCTs.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently screened the literature, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. We performed statistical analyses using a random-effects model and interpreted them according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We planned subgroup analyses by age, prostate volume, and severity of baseline symptoms, and used the GRADE approach to rate the certainty of the evidence.

- **Main results**: We included two RCTs with 297 participants comparing PUL to sham surgery or TURP. The mean age of the participants was 65.6 years, and the mean International Prostate Symptom Score was 22.

### Aquablation of the prostate for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^111TBZ7W]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

New, minimally invasive surgeries have emerged as alternatives to transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for the management of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Aquablation is a novel, minimally invasive, water-based therapy, combining image guidance and robotics for the removal of prostatic tissue.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of Aquablation for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia.

- **Search methods**: We performed a comprehensive search using multiple databases (the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and LILACS), trials registries, other sources of grey literature, and conference proceedings published up to 11 February 2019, with no restrictions on the language or status of publication.

- **Selection criteria**: We included parallel-group randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs, as well as non-randomised observational prospective studies with comparison groups in which participants with BPH underwent Aquablation.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion at each stage and undertook data extraction and 'Risk of bias' and GRADE assessments of the certainty of the evidence. We considered review outcomes measured up to and including 12 months after randomisation as short-term and beyond 12 months as long-term.

- **Main results**: We included one RCT with 184 participants comparing Aquablation to TURP. The mean age and International Prostate Symptom Score were 6.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of new surgical treatments for benign prostatic hyperplasia: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114ffU2t]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia are the most common urological problem among men, affecting about a third of men over age 50. Surgical intervention is the most effective treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia, with around 100,000 procedures carried out annually in the United States. Of all surgical treatments, monopolar transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), in which the enlarged prostate tissue is resected piece by piece using a monopolar electrode, has been the preferred method since the 1970s. It can substantially improve the maximal flow rate (Qmax), urinary symptoms (based on the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)), and health-related quality of life, with long-term efficacy compared with drugs or other minimally invasive treatments. However, monopolar TURP is a risky procedure because of the likelihood of severe complications such as massive bleeding or transurethral resection syndrome. Therefore, minimally invasive surgical techniques need to be developed with outcomes similar to those of monopolar TURP, but with fewer side effects.

Since the 2000s, new energy systems for surgical interventions treating benign prostatic hyperplasia have quickly become popular, including systems that use bipolar energy and various laser systems such as the holmium laser, potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser, thulium laser, and diode laser. The trend in surgical treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia has shifted from monopolar TURP to laser treatments and bipolar TURP over the past 10 years. Bipolar energy can be an effective alternative…

### The prostaglandin pathway is activated in patients who fail medical therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia with lower urinary tract symptoms [^1112tvXk]. The Prostate (2021). Low credibility.

Little is known about how benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) develops and why patients respond differently to medical therapy designed to reduce lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). The Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) trial randomized men with symptoms of BPH and followed response to medical therapy for up to six years. Treatment with a 5α-reductase inhibitor (5ARI) or an alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist (α-blocker) reduced the risk of clinical progression, while men treated with combination therapy showed a 66% decrease in risk of progressive disease. However, medical therapies for BPH/LUTS are not effective in many patients, and the reasons for nonresponse or loss of therapeutic response in the remaining patients over time are unknown. A better understanding of why patients fail to respond to medical therapy may have a major impact on developing new approaches for the medical treatment of BPH/LUTS. Prostaglandins (PG) act on G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), where PGE2 and PGF2 elicit smooth muscle contraction. Therefore, we measured PG levels in the prostate tissue of BPH/LUTS patients to assess the possibility that this signaling pathway might explain the failure of medical therapy in BPH/LUTS patients.

- **Method**: Surgical BPH (S-BPH) was defined as benign prostatic tissue collected from the transition zone (TZ) of patients who failed medical therapy and underwent surgical intervention to relieve LUTS. Control tissue was termed Incidental BPH (I-BPH), which was TZ tissue obtained from men undergoing radical prostatectomy for low-volume, low-grade prostate cancer.

### New medical treatments for lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia and future perspectives [^1156pU8K]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Historically, the standard medical treatment for LUTS in men with BPH included α1-antagonists, 5α-reductase inhibitors, and phytotherapy. These agents remain the mainstay of BPH treatment today. Nonetheless, despite full-dose treatment, some patients remain symptomatic or may experience BPH progression, defined as the onset of acute urinary retention (AUR), urinary infection (UI), or the need for BPH-related surgery. In addition, the drugs routinely used in the management of LUTS carry potential adverse effects (AE), which in turn may be the cause of non-compliance among patients. Therefore, research is progressing to expand and optimize medical strategies in the management of BPH-related LUTS.

Selective α1-antagonists, phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, and anticholinergics have been tested and have entered our armamentarium for the management of male LUTS. These agents, along with their pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and AEs, should be well known to the practicing urologist. Furthermore, our knowledge of bladder and prostatic molecular anatomy is constantly growing, and in parallel, new biomolecular targets are being identified and explored as new candidates in BPH management.

The objective of this systematic review is to summarize the evidence regarding the new medical therapies currently available for BPH-related LUTS and to give an overview of research and agents which may enter our everyday clinical practice in the near future.

### Transurethral resection of the prostate provides more favorable clinical outcomes compared with conservative medical treatment in patients with urinary retention caused by benign prostatic obstruction [^116bx6wU]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) affects approximately 210 million men globally and is a major cause of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) in aging men. LUTSs negatively affect patients' quality of life and cost the US healthcare system more than $4 billion each year. One study estimated that 50% and 75% of men have histological evidence of BPH by the age of 50 and 80 years, respectively, with approximately 50% of them having clinically significant symptoms. The sequelae of BPH include decreased urinary flow and advancing voiding and storage symptoms; these may eventually result in acute or chronic urinary retention (UR).

Although men with acute UR caused by BPH have an increased chance of returning to normal voiding if treatment with α-1 blockers is started at the time of catheter insertion, 24%–42% of patients elect to receive surgical intervention instead. According to the updated guidelines, surgical intervention is an appropriate treatment for patients with moderate-to-severe LUTSs and for patients who have developed acute UR or other BPH-related complications. Surgical treatment is often effective and prevents the need for indwelling or intermittent catheterization in the future. However, in a previous study, 79% of patients received α1-blockers before catheter removal, and most of them could void successfully without requiring an indwelling catheter.

To the best of our knowledge, very few studies have compared long-term treatment outcomes between transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and medical treatment in patients with BPO who experience.

### Common questions about the diagnosis and management of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^115ywDbp]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common condition that increases in prevalence with age. A history should include the onset, duration, and severity of lower urinary tract symptoms and medication use to rule out other causes of symptoms. The physical examination includes a digital rectal examination and an assessment for bladder distention or neurologic impairment. Recommended tests include serum prostate-specific antigen measurement and urinalysis to help identify infection, genitourinary cancer, or calculi as an alternative cause of lower urinary tract symptoms.

BPH severity is assessed using validated, self-administered symptom questionnaires, such as the American Urological Association Symptom Index or the International Prostate Symptom Score. Mild or nonbothersome symptoms do not require treatment. Bothersome symptoms are managed with lifestyle modifications, medications, and surgery. Alpha blockers are first-line medications for BPH. Surgical referral is indicated if BPH-related complications develop, medical therapy fails, or the patient chooses it. Dietary supplements, such as saw palmetto, pygeum, cernilton, and beta sitosterols, and acupuncture are not recommended for the management of BPH.

### Personalized medicine for the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^116PK3qr]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia affects more than 50% of men by age 60 years and is the cause of millions of dollars in healthcare expenditure for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms and urinary obstruction. Despite the widespread use of medical therapy, there is no universal treatment for all men with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia. At least 30% of patients do not respond to medical management, and a subset requires surgery. Significant advances have been made in understanding the natural history and development of the prostate, such as elucidating the role of the enzyme 5α-reductase type 2. Advances in genomics and biomarker discovery offer the potential for a more targeted approach to therapy. We review the understanding of benign prostatic hyperplasia progression as well as the key genes and signaling pathways implicated in the process, such as 5α-reductase. We also explore the potential of biomarker screening and gene-specific therapies as tools to risk-stratify patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia and identify those with symptomatic or medically resistant forms.

A PubMed® literature search and past peer-reviewed literature on prostate development, lower urinary tract symptoms, benign prostatic hyperplasia pathogenesis, targeted therapy, biomarkers, epigenetics, 5α-reductase type 2, and personalized medicine was performed. An additional Google Scholar™ search was conducted to broaden the scope of the review. Relevant reviews and original research articles were examined, as were their citations.

### New therapeutic targets to prevent benign prostatic enlargement and symptomatic progression to benign prostatic obstruction-ICI-RS 2023 [^115qFrZ7]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2024). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) can impact lower urinary tract function due to its potential progression to benign prostatic obstruction (BPO). Treatment options include removal of the obstruction by surgery or the use of therapeutics designed to slow growth or reduce tissue stress imposed by muscular stromal components. Inflammation and the development of fibrosis can also raise intrinsic tissue stress within the gland, further impacting obstruction. Outflow tract obstruction can also impact emission and ejaculation if the obstruction persists.

This review summarizes an ICI-RS think tank considering novel drug treatments that might address BPO caused by the progressive development of BPE, as well as manage decompensation changes to bladder function.

Topics included recent advances in our understanding of pathological changes occurring to the prostate and other lower urinary tract tissues during the progressive development of BPE. The prevention or reversal might benefit from identifying novel drug targets. These included contractile properties of prostatic tissues, the impact of BPE on bladder function, the deposition of intramural fibrotic tissue with protracted BPO, and the role of inflammation in the development of BPE and its progression to BPO. In particular, we discussed therapeutic options for treating BPE/BPO, new therapeutic targets, what they treat, and their advantages over medications.

Several new drug targets were identified, including soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), the receptor for…

### Prevention of benign prostatic hyperplasia disease [^113gUSZM]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

We reviewed the evidence that benign prostatic hyperplasia is a progressive condition and that men at risk for this disease can be identified, treated, and protected to a meaningful extent regardless of symptom status.

- **Materials and methods**: The MEDLINE database was searched in four areas of interest relating to benign prostatic hyperplasia, including:

	- Progression of clinical manifestations with age, especially in regard to baseline symptom status
	- Incidence of complications due to disease progression
	- Use of predictive factors that may help identify men at risk for disease progression
	- Prevention of benign prostatic hyperplasia disease with medical therapy

- **Results**: Tissue changes in the prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia) are an inevitable consequence of aging. However, the disease, which we define as a life-altering urinary condition requiring medical intervention, is both predictable and preventable. Disease progression is associated with increasing prostate volume, decreasing urinary flow, and symptomatic deterioration, often leading to significant lifestyle interference and serious complications, such as acute urinary retention and the need for surgery. The risk of disease progression was found to be directly related to prostate volume and its surrogate marker, serum prostate-specific antigen, after prostate cancer is excluded. Other factors, like baseline symptoms and flow rate, were found to be less relevant compared to prostate-specific antigen levels.

### Managing patients with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^115cwx6k]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Many men with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia can be managed safely and effectively by primary care providers. After a basic evaluation to exclude other diseases that may cause lower urinary tract symptoms, quantifying the degree of symptoms and bother, and perhaps making an assessment of prostate size, the primary care provider can determine which men require immediate evaluation by a urologist and which men may choose among various treatment options, including watchful waiting and various single-agent or combination medication strategies. Recent information about risk factors for disease progression has also helped to inform patient decisions on which treatment option is best for the individual patient. The purpose of this review is to provide primary care providers with an approach to the management of men with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

### Minimally invasive procedures as an alternative to medical management for lower urinary tract symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^117XMsn9]. Current Opinion in Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Data are reviewed relating to the safety and efficacy of minimally invasive transurethral microwave thermotherapy and medical management in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Recent evidence is summarized, indicating more pronounced long-term beneficial effects of microwave treatment. Alpha-blockade, however, offers the advantage of more rapid action than microwave treatment. Neoadjuvant and adjuvant alpha-blocker therapy can accelerate symptom and flow rate improvement in patients receiving microwave treatment. Compared with medical management, microwave treatment possesses greater versatility, allowing patients with severe baseline symptoms and small prostate sizes to be treated with a high probability of success.

### Lower urinary tract symptoms in men [^112KBL92]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a highly prevalent and costly condition that affects older men worldwide. Many affected men develop lower urinary tract symptoms, which can negatively impact their quality of life. In the past, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) was the mainstay of treatment. However, several efficacious drug treatments have been developed, transforming BPH from an acute surgical entity to a chronic medical condition. Multiple clinical trials have shown that α adrenoceptor antagonists can significantly ameliorate lower urinary tract symptoms. Moreover, 5α reductase inhibitors, alone or combined with an α adrenoceptor antagonist, can reverse the natural course of BPH, reducing the risk of urinary retention and the need for surgical intervention. Newer medical regimens, including the use of antimuscarinic agents or phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, have shown promise in men with predominantly storage symptoms and concomitant erectile dysfunction, respectively. For men who do not adequately respond to conservative measures or pharmacotherapy, minimally invasive surgical techniques (such as transurethral needle ablation, microwave thermotherapy, and prostatic urethral lift) may be of benefit, although they lack the durability of TURP. A variety of laser procedures have also been introduced, with improved hemostatic properties that abrogate many of the complications associated with traditional surgery.

### Rates of prostate surgery and acute urinary retention for benign prostatic hyperplasia in men treated with dutasteride or finasteride [^112kMwGY]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) affects 32–52% of men aged 51–60 years and 77–99% of men aged 81 and above. Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), such as poor stream and hesitancy, are common in patients with BPH. Progression of BPH may result in acute urinary retention (AUR) and the need for surgical procedures that partially remove the prostate. To relieve BPH-related symptoms, alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonists, known as "alpha-blockers", can be used.

Previous studies suggest that the combination of alpha-blockers and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) can be beneficial in the treatment of BPH associated with LUTS. The greatest efficacy for this combination treatment was observed in patients with a large prostate size, a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value of > 1.5 ng/ml, and moderate to severe symptoms based on the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). These patients experienced significant symptom relief and a decreased risk of AUR and surgery compared to those treated with monotherapy.

Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a metabolite of testosterone, is the main mediator of prostate growth. As a class, 5-ARIs aim to reduce the size of the prostate by blocking the activity of 5-alpha reductase enzymes, which convert testosterone to DHT. The currently available 5-ARI agents in the United States and European markets (dutasteride and finasteride) have been shown to reduce prostate volume by 20–30%. Long-term use of 5-ARI agents results in symptomatic improvements and a reduction in the risk of AUR and prostate surgery. Dutasteride blocks both type 1 and type 2 enzymes, significantly impacting prostate volume.
