## Question

What is the recommended dosage for: Treatment of rickettsialpox in adults?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended dosage for treating rickettsialpox in adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the first-line agent and whether rickettsialpox is explicitly included in labeled indications. Then, I should verify adult dosing regimens from authoritative sources and reconcile any discrepancies. Next, I will consider duration of therapy and stopping rules. After that, I need to check alternatives for doxycycline intolerance or allergy. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable recommendation with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the drug of choice and indication. Rickettsialpox is caused by Rickettsia akari, and doxycycline is the first-line therapy for rickettsial infections, including rickettsialpox, with multiple FDA labels listing rickettsialpox as an approved indication for doxycycline, which supports using doxycycline as standard therapy here [^111K91CW] [^116yb9yZ] [^111jYfcM].

> Now, I should verify adult dosing. Most authoritative guidance converges on 100 mg orally twice daily for adults with rickettsial infections, including rickettsialpox, and this is reflected in CDC travel medicine guidance and wilderness medicine guidelines for spotted fever group rickettsioses, which include rickettsialpox among entities treated with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily [^116AGqqj] [^113hWB6K] [^115CgaTA].

> Wait, let me verify whether a loading dose is required. Some FDA labels describe a 200 mg loading dose on day 1 (for example, 100 mg every 12 hours), followed by 100 mg daily thereafter; however, that loading strategy is not consistently emphasized in rickettsial-specific guidance, and CDC/WMS recommendations for rickettsioses generally endorse 100 mg twice daily from the outset without a separate loading day, so I should align with the rickettsial-focused regimens rather than generic antibacterial labeling that includes a load for other indications [^111Z6xux] [^115TZPwA] [^116AGqqj] [^113hWB6K].

> I need to ensure duration and stopping rules are correct. The minimum course is 5–7 days, but treatment should continue for at least 3 days after fever subsides and until there is clear clinical improvement; failure to defervesce within 48 hours of appropriate therapy should prompt reconsideration of the diagnosis or evaluation for complications or coinfections, which is a key clinical checkpoint [^116AGqqj] [^113hWB6K] [^116K1eJ3].

> Hold on, I should verify alternatives in case of doxycycline intolerance or true allergy. Tetracycline 500 mg orally twice daily is an FDA-listed alternative for rickettsialpox, though doxycycline remains preferred; in severe tetracycline allergy, chloramphenicol may be considered historically, but access is limited in the U.S. and it carries higher risks, so specialist input is advised if alternatives are needed [^113XAhXe] [^114f8qC1] [^117RNWpj].

> Let me synthesize the final, clinically actionable regimen. For adults with rickettsialpox, prescribe doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for a minimum of 5–7 days, ensuring at least 3 days after fever resolution and clinical improvement before stopping; initiate therapy promptly when rickettsialpox is suspected and do not delay for confirmatory testing, as early treatment improves outcomes [^116AGqqj] [^113hWB6K] [^116K1eJ3].

---

The recommended treatment for rickettsialpox in adults is **doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily** [^116AGqqj] for 7 days [^114QSd6f]. If doxycycline is contraindicated, **tetracycline 500 mg orally twice daily** [^113XAhXe] is an alternative. Treatment should be started promptly when rickettsialpox is suspected, and **no loading dose is required** [^116AGqqj].

---

## Recommended dosage and administration

### Doxycycline (first-line therapy)

- **Dosage**: 100 mg orally twice daily (every 12 hours) [^116AGqqj].
- **Duration**: 7 days [^114QSd6f].
- **Administration**: Oral therapy is appropriate for outpatient treatment; intravenous therapy is reserved for severe cases or when oral intake is not feasible [^1139pF3K].

---

### Alternative therapy: tetracycline

If doxycycline is contraindicated (e.g. severe allergy), **tetracycline 500 mg orally twice daily** [^113XAhXe] is an alternative regimen.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting recommended dosage

Doxycycline is the **treatment of choice** for rickettsialpox and other rickettsial infections because of its proven efficacy, safety, and rapid clinical response [^116AGqqj] [^116MeyQq]. Clinical guidelines from the CDC and other authoritative sources consistently recommend doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days for adult patients with rickettsialpox [^116AGqqj] [^114QSd6f].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

Doxycycline exhibits favorable pharmacokinetic properties, including:

- **Oral bioavailability**: Approximately 90–100%.
- **Half-life**: 18–24 hours, allowing for twice-daily dosing.
- **Tissue penetration**: Excellent, including intracellular penetration, which is critical for eradicating intracellular Rickettsia species [^112YcjZv].

These properties support the **recommended twice-daily dosing regimen**, ensuring sustained therapeutic levels and effective bacterial eradication.

---

## Clinical response and outcomes

Patients typically experience **rapid clinical improvement** within 24–48 hours of initiating doxycycline therapy [^113hWB6K]. Fever subsides, and systemic symptoms resolve within a few days. Complete recovery is expected with adherence to the recommended 7-day course of therapy [^notfound].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Doxycycline is generally well tolerated. Common adverse effects include gastrointestinal upset, photosensitivity, and rare hypersensitivity reactions. Serious adverse effects are uncommon, and the benefits of therapy outweigh the risks in patients with rickettsialpox [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Doxycycline is contraindicated in pregnancy due to potential fetal risks. Alternative therapies should be considered.
- **Drug interactions**: Doxycycline may interact with antacids, calcium supplements, and iron-containing products, reducing its absorption. These should be administered separately.

## Summary of recommendations

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage** | **Duration** | **Route** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Doxycycline | 100 mg twice daily | 7 days | Oral |
| Tetracycline | 500 mg twice daily | 7 days | Oral |

---

The recommended treatment for rickettsialpox in adults is **doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days** [^116AGqqj] [^114QSd6f]. Alternative therapy with tetracycline 500 mg orally twice daily may be used if doxycycline is contraindicated [^113XAhXe].

Summary Tickborne rickettsial diseases continue to cause severe illness and death in otherwise healthy adults and children, despite the availability of low-cost, effective antibacterial therapy. Recognition early in the clinical course is critical because this is the period when antibacterial therapy is most effective. Early signs and symptoms of these illnesses are nonspecific or mimic other illnesses, which can make diagnosis challenging. The CDC Rickettsial Zoonoses Branch, in consultation with external clinical and academic specialists and public health professionals, developed this report to assist health care providers and public health professionals to 1) recognize key epidemiologic features and clinical manifestations of tickborne rickettsial diseases, 2) recognize that doxycycline.

is the treatment of choice for suspected tickborne rickettsial diseases in adults and children, 3) understand that early empiric antibacterial therapy can prevent severe disease and death, 4) request the appropriate confirmatory diagnostic tests and understand their usefulness and limitations, and 5) report probable and confirmed cases of tickborne rickettsial diseases to public health authorities. recognize that early and empiric treatment with doxycycline can prevent severe morbidity or death; recognize doxycycline as the treatment of choice for adults and children of all ages with suspected rickettsial disease; make treatment decisions for patients with certain conditions, such as a doxycycline allergy or pregnancy; recognize when to consider coinfection with other tickborne pathogens;. Methods This report updates the 2006 CDC recommendations for the diagnosis and management of tickborne rickettsial diseases in the United States.

Updated recommendations are needed to address the changing epidemiology of tickborne rickettsial diseases, provide current information about new and emerging tickborne rickettsial pathogens, and highlight advances in recommended diagnostic tests and updated treatment information. Additional criteria were applied on a per-question basis. For some questions, an insufficient number of studies was identified to support the development of a recommendation. In these instances, the report indicates that the evidence was insufficient for a recommendation, and when possible, general guidance is provided based on the available evidence and expert opinion of the CDC Rickettsial Zoonoses Branch. Age-specific incidence of anaplasmosis is highest among those aged ≥ 60 years. The reported case-fatality rate during 2008–2012 was 0. 3% and was higher among persons aged ≥ 70 years and those with immunosuppression.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The usual dosage and frequency of administration of doxycycline differs from that of the other tetracyclines. Exceeding the recommended dosage may result in an increased incidence of side effects.

Adults:

The usual dose of oral doxycycline is 200 mg on the first day of treatment (administered 100 mg every 12 hours) followed by a maintenance dose of 100 mg/day. In the management of more severe infections (particularly chronic infections of the urinary tract), 100 mg every 12 hours is recommended.

Pediatric Patients:

For all pediatric patients weighing less than 45 kg with severe or life-threatening infections (e.g., anthrax, Rocky Mountain spotted fever), the recommended dosage is 2.2 mg/kg of body weight administered every 12 hours. Children weighing 45 kg or more should receive the adult dose. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS .)

For pediatric patients with less severe disease (greater than 8 years of age and weighing less than 45 kg), the recommended dosage schedule is 4.4 mg/kg of body weight divided into two doses on the first day of treatment, followed by a maintenance dose of 2.2 mg/kg of body weight (given as a single daily dose or divided into twice daily doses). For pediatric patients weighing over 45 kg, the usual adult dose should be used.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Lyme disease chemoprophylaxis after a high-risk Ixodes spp. bite — For high-risk Ixodes spp. bites in all age groups, we recommend the administration of a single dose of oral doxycycline within 72 hours of tick removal over observation (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Doxycycline is given as a single oral dose, 200 mg for adults and 4.4 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 200 mg) for children. Evidence summarized from four placebo-controlled trials in endemic areas found that among 1082 randomized subjects the placebo-group risk was 3.0% and that antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduced risk versus placebo (risk ratio [RR]: 0.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] (.10, .75)); absolute risk: 22 fewer per 1000, 95% CI (7 to 27 fewer per 1000). No serious adverse effects were reported, though drug rashes and gastrointestinal side effects occurred. The guideline notes insufficient evidence to recommend topical antibiotics and calls for additional research to evaluate whether brief courses of amoxicillin or other antibiotics are comparable to doxycycline for prophylaxis.

Pediatric Use

Because of the effects of drugs of the tetracycline-class on tooth development and growth, use doxycycline in pediatric patients 8 years of age or less only when the potential benefits are expected to outweigh the risks in severe or life-threatening conditions (e.g., anthrax, Rocky Mountain spotted fever), particularly when there are no alternative therapies (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Tickborne rickettsial diseases — treatment and management: Doxycycline is the drug of choice for treatment of all tickborne rickettsial diseases in patients of all ages, including children aged < 8 years, and should be initiated immediately in persons with signs and symptoms suggestive of rickettsial disease, and treatment decisions for rickettsial pathogens should never be delayed while awaiting laboratory confirmation because delay in treatment can lead to severe disease and long-term sequelae or death. The recommended dose of doxycycline for the treatment of tickborne rickettsial diseases is 100 mg twice daily (orally or intravenously) for adults and 2.2 mg/kg body weight twice daily (orally or intravenously) for children weighing < 100 lbs (45 kg). Oral therapy is appropriate for patients with early stage disease who can be treated as outpatients, whereas intravenous therapy might be indicated for more severely ill patients who are vomiting or obtunded. The recommended duration of therapy for RMSF and ehrlichiosis is at least 3 days after subsidence of fever and until evidence of clinical improvement is noted; 5–7 days of total therapy is usually sufficient for uncomplicated infections, and the recommended duration of therapy for anaplasmosis is generally 10 days. Because of the nonspecific signs and symptoms of tickborne rickettsial diseases, early empiric treatment for rickettsial diseases often needs to be administered concomitantly with empiric treatment for other conditions in the differential diagnosis; for example, when meningococcal disease is also considered, administering antibacterial therapy to treat potential Neisseria meningitidis infection in addition to administering doxycycline to treat rickettsial agents is appropriate while awaiting additional diagnostic information.

### Antibiotics for treating scrub typhus [^114tsTVi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Scrub typhus is a bacterial disease in regions of Asia and the Pacific. Antibiotics (chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and doxycycline) have been used to treat the disease. Resistance to these antibiotics has been reported.

Objectives

To evaluate antibiotic regimens for treating scrub typhus.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group specialized trials register (March 2002); the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2002); MEDLINE (1966 to March 2002); EMBASE (1988 to January 2002); LILACS (2001, 40a Edition CD-ROM). We checked references and contacted authors for additional data.

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized studies comparing antibiotic regimens in people diagnosed with scrub typhus.

Data Collection and Analysis

One reviewer screened the search results; both reviewers assessed eligibility, quality and extracted data. We used Review Manager (Version 4.1), and expressed results as Relative Risk (binary) or weighted mean difference (continuous), with 95% confidence intervals.

Main Results

Four trials involving 451 adults met the inclusion criteria. One small study did not demonstrate a difference between tetracycline with chloramphenicol (participants afebrile after 48 hours, Relative Risk 1.00; 95% confidence interval 0.07 to 15.26). Two small trials did not show a difference between doxycycline and tetracycline (participants afebrile after 48 hours, Relative Risk 0.46; 95% confidence interval 0.12 to 1.75). One trial showed rifampicin to be more effective than doxycycline (for eliminating fever, Relative Risk 0.41; 95% confidence interval 0.22 to 0.77; no relapses in either group).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Limited data has not demonstrated a difference between tetracycline and doxycycline. Limited data suggest rifampicin is effective in areas where scrub typhus appears to respond poorly to standard anti-rickettsial drugs.

### Antibiotics for treating scrub typhus [^117EHo51]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Scrub typhus, an important cause of acute fever in Asia, is caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi, an obligate intracellular bacterium. Antibiotics currently used to treat scrub typhus include tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, macrolides, and rifampicin.

Objectives

To assess and compare the effects of different antibiotic regimens for treatment of scrub typhus.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 8 January 2018: the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group specialized trials register; CENTRAL, in the Cochrane Library (2018, Issue 1); MEDLINE; Embase; LILACS; and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT). We checked references and contacted study authors for additional data. We applied no language or date restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing antibiotic regimens in people with the diagnosis of scrub typhus based on clinical symptoms and compatible laboratory tests (excluding the Weil-Felix test).

Data Collection and Analysis

For this update, two review authors re-extracted all data and assessed the certainty of evidence. We meta-analysed data to calculate risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes when appropriate, and elsewhere tabulated data to facilitate narrative analysis.

Main Results

We included six RCTs and one quasi-RCT with 548 participants; they took place in the Asia-Pacific region: Korea (three trials), Malaysia (one trial), and Thailand (three trials). Only one trial included children younger than 15 years (N = 57). We judged five trials to be at high risk of performance and detection bias owing to inadequate blinding. Trials were heterogenous in terms of dosing of interventions and outcome measures. Across trials, treatment failure rates were low. Two trials compared doxycycline to tetracycline. For treatment failure, the difference between doxycycline and tetracycline is uncertain (very low-certainty evidence). Doxycycline compared to tetracycline may make little or no difference in resolution of fever within 48 hours (risk ratio (RR) 1.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 1.44, 55 participants; one trial; low-certainty evidence) and in time to defervescence (116 participants; one trial; low-certainty evidence). We were unable to extract data for other outcomes. Three trials compared doxycycline versus macrolides. For most outcomes, including treatment failure, resolution of fever within 48 hours, time to defervescence, and serious adverse events, we are uncertain whether study results show a difference between doxycycline and macrolides (very low-certainty evidence). Macrolides compared to doxycycline may make little or no difference in the proportion of patients with resolution of fever within five days (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.10; 185 participants; two trials; low-certainty evidence). Another trial compared azithromycin versus doxycycline or chloramphenicol in children, but we were not able to disaggregate date for the doxycycline/chloramphenicol group. One trial compared doxycycline versus rifampicin. For all outcomes, we are uncertain whether study results show a difference between doxycycline and rifampicin (very low-certainty evidence). Of note, this trial deviated from the protocol after three out of eight patients who had received doxycycline and rifampicin combination therapy experienced treatment failure. Across trials, mild gastrointestinal side effects appeared to be more common with doxycycline than with comparator drugs.

Authors' Conclusions

Tetracycline, doxycycline, azithromycin, and rifampicin are effective treatment options for scrub typhus and have resulted in few treatment failures. Chloramphenicol also remains a treatment option, but we could not include this among direct comparisons in this review. Most available evidence is of low or very low certainty. For specific outcomes, some low-certainty evidence suggests there may be little or no difference between tetracycline, doxycycline, and azithromycin as treatment options. Given very low-certainty evidence for rifampicin and the risk of inducing resistance in undiagnosed tuberculosis, clinicians should not regard this as a first-line treatment option. Clinicians could consider rifampicin as a second-line treatment option after exclusion of active tuberculosis. Further research should consist of additional adequately powered trials of doxycycline versus azithromycin or other macrolides, trials of other candidate antibiotics including rifampicin, and trials of treatments for severe scrub typhus. Researchers should standardize diagnostic techniques and reporting of clinical outcomes to allow robust comparisons.

We checked references and contacted study authors for additional data. We applied no language or date restrictions.

Selection criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs comparing antibiotic regimens in people with the diagnosis of scrub typhus based on clinical symptoms and compatible laboratory tests (excluding the Weil‐Felix test).

Data collection and analysis

For this update, two review authors re‐extracted all data and assessed the certainty of evidence. We meta‐analysed data to calculate risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes when appropriate, and elsewhere tabulated data to facilitate narrative analysis.

Tetracycline, doxycycline, azithromycin, and rifampicin are effective treatment options for scrub typhus and have resulted in few treatment failures. Chloramphenicol also remains a treatment option, but we could not include this among direct comparisons in this review.

Most available evidence is of low or very low certainty.

### Mediterranean spotted fever with multiorgan involvement [^114TiQxn]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Tetracyclines are the treatment of choice for rickettsial diseases.MSF is most commonly treated with doxycycline 100 mg two times per day for 7–14 days, depending on clinical severity. Alternatives to doxycycline include chloramphenicol and macrolides such as azithromycin. Given the unknown central nervous system (CNS) penetration of doxycycline, dosing in CNS rickettsial disease can be as high as 200 mg two times per day for the first 72 hours. Our patient was initially prescribed intravenous doxycycline given likely gastrointestinal malabsorption secondary to sepsis-induced ileus. Once he was able to tolerate oral intake, he was converted to oral dosing.

There are no vaccines available for rickettsial diseases and antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended. Prevention of disease involves regular self-checks, avoidance of ticks and tick habitats, wearing barrier clothing and using insecticides. Mortality of MSF in countries such as Portugal is around 3.6%, but can be as high as 60% without treatment. Mortality rates and disease severity tend to be worse in adults than children. Our patient had a very good clinical outcome despite a late presentation with severe rickettsial disease with multiorgan involvement.

Patient's perspective

In late spring I took a trip to the Mediterranean. I was bitten by an insect in the long grass but dismissed it because this often happens. Within a few days of my return home, I started to feel unwell. The bite became red and black. I spoke to the GP and sent them a picture and they prescribed antibiotics. Over the next couple of days, I felt worse despite the antibiotics so went to see the GP. I had not realised how sick I was but the GP was fantastic. He took one look at me and immediately referred me to A&E and then organised an ambulance to take me there.

On arrival at the hospital, I could not have received better care and attention. Initially, they could not diagnose what was wrong with me. They ran extensive tests including blood tests, ECGs and a chest X-ray. While trying to diagnose the problem they gave me a cocktail of treatments and monitored me carefully. I was transferred to ICU where I received 1:1 care 24 hours of the day.

### Flea-borne rickettsioses and rickettsiae [^114qGXjb]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Doxycycline is the treatment of choice for all rickettsioses. Fever usually abates within 48–72 hours after initiation. A 7-day course is the usual duration of treatment. Chloramphenicol is an alternative drug but is likely less effective. In the United States, the oral formulation of chloramphenicol is not available, and the intravenous formulation is extremely difficult to acquire. Fluoroquinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) are also alternatives, but as the case with chloramphenicol, they are associated with longer times to defervescence than doxycycline when used for murine typhus (4.23 days for ciprofloxacin, 4.00 days for chloramphenicol, 2.89 days for doxycycline).

### Vesicular spotted fever due tosimulates the clinicopathologic features of rickettsialpox [^114QSd6f]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

SFGR include a family of genetically linked Rickettsia organisms, with RMSF being the most common infection associated with this group. Other SFGR infections endemic to the United States include Pacific Coast tick fever caused by Rickettsia species 346D, rickettsialpox caused by R akari in the urban Northeast, and rickettsiosis caused by R parkeri and transmitted by the Gulf Coast tick in the Southeastern United States, particularly in Florida. Hence, geography is helpful in identifying the likely causative Rickettsia species within patients.

Identification of R parkeri rickettsiosis was first documented in 2004. More than 40 patients infected with R parkeri have been reported. Appropriate diagnosis of R parkeri infection in recent years has contributed to an improved understanding of its domestic epidemiologic and clinical impact. The Gulf Coast tick, Amblyomma maculatum, is chiefly responsible for transmission.

The typical manifestations of R parkeri reflect a relatively mild disease pattern associated with characteristic necrotic eschars identified in > 90% of infections. In addition to R parkeri infection, other rickettsioses can produce eschar combined with vesicles, including rickettsialpox, Mediterranean spotted fever, Queensland tick typhus, and African tick bite fever. Thrombocytopenia, transaminitis, and leukopenia may also be observed, but these findings are relatively nonspecific.

Doxycycline is the cornerstone of treatment of R parkeri infection and all other rickettsioses in patients of all ages. In pediatric patients, the dose is 2.2 mg/kg twice daily (up to maximum of 200 mg/d) for 7 days; in adults, the dose is 100 mg twice daily for 7 days.

### A comparative trial of a single dose of azithromycin versus doxycycline for the treatment of mild scrub typhus [^114hGexm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Scrub typhus is one of the most important endemic infections in the Asia-Pacific region. Although tetracyclines or chloramphenicol are the recommended drugs of choice for the treatment of scrub typhus, reports of doxycycline-resistant strains have prompted a search for alternative treatments.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, open-label, randomized trial from September 2002 through November 2003 to compare azithromycin with doxycycline for the treatment of mild scrub typhus. The time to defervescence was assessed to compare the efficacy of the 2 treatment regimens.

Results

A total of 93 patients were randomly assigned to receive either a single 500-mg dose of azithromycin or a 1-week course of daily oral 200-mg dose of doxycycline. Cure was achieved in 47 (100%) of 47 patients in the azithromycin-treated group and in 43 (93.5%) of 46 patients in the doxycycline-treated group (P = 0.117). The median time to defervescence was 21 h for the azithromycin-treated group and 29 h for the doxycycline-treated group (P = 0.097). There were no serious adverse events during the study. No relapses occurred in either group during a 1-month follow-up period.

Conclusion

The single 500-mg dose of azithromycin was as effective as the 1-week course of daily 200-mg doses of doxycycline for the treatment of mild scrub typhus acquired in South Korea.

### Doxycycline hyclate (Doryx) [^111M7iUs]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of DORYX and other antibacterial drugs, DORYX should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Treatment

Doxycycline is indicated for the treatment of the following infections:

Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus fever and the typhus group, Q fever, rickettsialpox, and tick fevers caused by Rickettsiae.
Respiratory tract infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
Lymphogranuloma venereum caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.
Psittacosis (ornithosis) caused by Chlamydia psittaci.
Trachoma caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, although the infectious agent is not always eliminated as judged by immunofluorescence.
Inclusion conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.
Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical or rectal infections in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.
Nongonococcal urethritis caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum.
Relapsing fever due to Borrelia recurrentis.

Doxycycline is also indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative microorganisms:

Chancroid caused by Haemophilus ducreyi.
Plague due to Yersinia pestis (formerly Pasteurella pesti s).

### Doxycycline for prevention of spirochetal infections: status report [^115xR7Gk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Important human infections caused by spirochetal microorganisms include Lyme disease, syphilis, leptospirosis, and tick-borne relapsing fever. Doxycycline prophylactic regimens have been shown to significantly reduce the risk for developing all of these infections in potentially exposed individuals, which is highly clinically relevant as no vaccines to prevent these infections in humans are currently available. Additional data, however, are needed to define more precisely the level of efficacy of the doxycycline prophylactic regimens, especially for Lyme disease and syphilis, infections that can be potentially prevented by a single 200-mg dose of doxycycline given within 72 hours postexposure.

When doxycycline is contraindicated, amoxicillin is dosed at 500 mg TID for adults and 50 mg/kg/d in 3 divided doses with a maximum 500 mg/dose (classification C), and cefuroxime axetil is dosed at 500 mg BID for adults and 30 mg/kg/d in 2 divided doses with a maximum 500 mg/dose (classification B). Parenteral options include ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily for adults and 50–75 mg/kg/d in 1 dose, max 2 g (classification B), cefotaxime 2 g IV Q8H for adults and 150–200 mg/kg/d in 3–4 divided doses with a max 6 g/day (classification B), and penicillin G 18–24 MU/d in divided doses Q4H for adults and 200–400,000 U/kg/d divided Q4H with a max 18–24 MU/day (classification B). For all regimens, recommended duration is 14 days, although courses ranging from 10 to 28 days have been used without significantly different outcomes; tetracyclines are relatively contraindicated in children < 8 years of age or in pregnant or lactating women; two oral alternatives (amoxicillin and cefuroxime axetil) are effective in non–nervous system Lyme borreliosis with no efficacy data in neuroborreliosis and may be an oral alternative in individuals who cannot take doxycycline; and antibiotic dosage should be reduced for patients with impaired renal function.

Prophylactic antibiotics for Lyme disease — Efforts were made in the 1990s to determine whether prophylactic antibiotics could prevent the development of Lyme disease in patients after an I scapularis tick bite. In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial comparing a single 200 mg dose of doxycycline to placebo in patients who had been exposed to I scapularis for less than 72 h, 8 of 247 (3%) placebo patients developed EM, compared to 1 of 235 (0.4%) patients receiving doxycycline, a statistically significant reduction in EM in treated patients.

Box 7 — summary of the treatment and management of tickborne rickettsial diseases — doxycycline is the drug of choice for all tickborne rickettsial diseases in children and adults, and empiric therapy should be initiated promptly in patients with a clinical presentation suggestive of a rickettsial disease. Tickborne rickettsial diseases respond rapidly to doxycycline, and fever persisting for > 48 hours after initiation of therapy should prompt consideration of an alternative or additional diagnosis, including the possibility of coinfection. The American Academy of Pediatrics and CDC recommend doxycycline as the treatment of choice for patients of all ages, including children aged < 8 years, with a suspected tickborne rickettsial disease, and delay in treatment can lead to severe disease and death. In persons with severe doxycycline allergy or who are pregnant, chloramphenicol may be an alternative treatment for Rocky Mountain spotted fever, but persons treated with chloramphenicol have a greater risk for severe disease or death compared with those treated with doxycycline. For mild cases of anaplasmosis, rifampin might be an alternative to doxycycline for patients with a severe drug allergy or who are pregnant. Data on the risks of doxycycline use during pregnancy suggest that treatment at the recommended dose and duration is unlikely to pose a substantial teratogenic risk, although data are insufficient to state that no risk exists. Prophylactic use of doxycycline after a tick bite is not recommended for the prevention of tickborne rickettsial disease, and treatment of asymptomatic persons seropositive for tickborne rickettsial disease is not recommended regardless of past treatment status because antibodies can persist for months to years after infection.

2.3 Dosage in Pediatric Patients

For all pediatric patients weighing less than 45 kg with severe or life-threatening infections (e.g., anthrax, Rocky Mountain spotted fever), the recommended dosage of doxycycline hyclate tablets is 2.2 mg per kg of body weight administered every 12 hours. Pediatric patients weighing 45 kg or more should receive the adult dose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
For pediatric patients with less severe disease (greater than 8 years of age and weighing less than 45 kg), the recommended dosage schedule of doxycycline hyclate tablets is 4.4 mg per kg of body weight divided into two doses on the first day of treatment, followed by a maintenance dose of 2.2 mg per kg of body weight (given as a single daily dose or divided into twice daily doses). For pediatric patients weighing over 45 kg, the usual adult dose should be used.

2.4 Dosage for Prophylaxis of Malaria

For adults, the recommended dose of doxycycline hyclate tablets is 100 mg daily.

For pediatric patients 8 years of age and older, the recommended dosage of doxycycline hyclate tablets is 2 mg per kg of body weight administered once daily. Pediatric patients weighing 45 kg or more should receive the adult dose.

Prophylaxis should begin 1 or 2 days before travel to the malarious area. Prophylaxis should be continued daily during travel in the malarious area and for 4 weeks after the traveler leaves the malarious area.

2.5 Dosage for Inhalational Anthrax (Post-Exposure)

For adults, the recommended dosage is 100 mg, of doxycycline hyclate tablets, by mouth, twice-a-day for 60 days.

For pediatric patients weighing less than 45 kg, the recommended dosage of doxycycline hyclate tablets is 2.2 mg per kg of body weight, by mouth, twice-a-day for 60 days. Pediatric patients weighing 45 kg or more should receive the adult dose.

Comparison 1: doxycycline versus tetracycline

Two trials compared doxycycline with tetracycline (Brown 1978; Song 1995).

One trial reported treatment failure (Song 1995); results show no significant differences between doxycycline and tetracycline (116 participants, 1 trial; Analysis 1.1).

One trial reported the proportion of participants with resolution of fever within 48 hours (Brown 1978); data show little or no difference between doxycycline and tetracycline (risk ratio (RR) 1.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 1.44; 55 participants, 1 trial; Analysis 1.2).

Neither trial reported proportions of participants with resolution of fever within five days.

One trial reported mean time to defervescence (Song 1995). Results show a mean of 37 hours (standard deviation (SD) ± 26.6 hours) for the tetracycline group and a mean of 34 hours (SD ± 26.5 hours) for the doxycycline group. Study authors reported that the difference was non‐significant via the log‐rank test.

Both trials discussed adverse events but did not formally report the presence or absence of serious adverse events. Gastrointestinal symptoms occurred more frequently with doxycycline than with tetracycline in both trials (not meta‐analysed; Table 5).

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF DOXYCYCLINE DIFFERS FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS.

Adults

The usual dose of oral doxycycline is 200 mg on the first day of treatment (administered 100 mg every 12 hours or 50 mg every 6 hours) followed by a maintenance dose of 100 mg/day. The maintenance dose may be administered as a single dose or as 50 mg every 12 hours. In the management of more severe infections (particularly chronic infections of the urinary tract), 100 mg every 12 hours is recommended.

Pediatric Patients:

For all pediatric patients weighing less than 45 kg with severe or life-threatening infections (e.g. anthrax, Rocky Mountain spotted fever), the recommended dosage is 2.2 mg/kg of body weight administered every 12 hours. Children weighing 45 kg or more should receive the adult dose (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).

For pediatric patients with less severe disease (greater than 8 years of age and weighing less than 45 kg), the recommended dosage schedule is 4.4 mg per kg of body weight divided into two doses on the first day of treatment, followed by a maintenance dose of 2.2 mg per kg of body weight (given as a single daily dose or divided into twice daily doses). For pediatric patients weighing over 45 kg, the usual adult dose should be used.

The therapeutic antibacterial serum activity will usually persist for 24 hours following recommended dosage.

When used in streptococcal infections, therapy should be continued for 10 days.

Administration of adequate amounts of fluid along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline class is recommended to wash down the drugs and reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS)

If gastric irritation occurs, it is recommended that doxycycline be given with food or milk. The absorption of doxycycline is not markedly influenced by simultaneous ingestion of food or milk.

Studies to date have indicated that administration of doxycycline at the usual recommended doses does not lead to excessive accumulation of doxycycline in patients with renal impairment.

Uncomplicated Gonococcal Infections in Adults (Except Anorectal Infections in Men)

100 mg, by mouth, twice a day for 7 days. As an alternate single visit dose, administer 300 mg stat followed in one hour by a second 300 mg dose.

Acute Epididymo-orchitis Caused by N. gonorrhoeae

100 mg, by mouth, twice a day for at least 10 days.

Discussion

See Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3.

Summary of main results

Across the trials included in this review, treatment failure rates were low.

Two trials compared doxycycline versus tetracycline (Table 1). For treatment failure, the difference between doxycycline and tetracycline is uncertain (very low‐certainty evidence). Doxycycline compared to tetracycline may make little or no difference in resolution of fever within 48 hours (low‐certainty evidence) or in time to defervescence (low‐certainty evidence). We were unable to extract data for other outcomes.

Three trials compared doxycycline versus macrolides (azithromycin and telithromycin; Table 2). For most outcomes, including treatment failure, resolution of fever within 48 hours, time to defervescence, and serious adverse events, we are uncertain whether results show a difference between doxycycline and macrolides (very low‐certainty evidence). Macrolides compared to doxycycline may make little or no difference in the proportion of patients with resolution of fever within five days (low‐certainty evidence). Another trial compared azithromycin to doxycycline or chloramphenicol in children, but we were unable to disaggregate data for the doxycycline/chloramphenicol group.

One trial compared doxycycline to rifampicin (Table 3). For all outcomes, we are uncertain whether results show a difference between doxycycline and rifampicin (very low‐certainty evidence). Of note, this trial deviated from the protocol after three out of eight patients who received doxycycline and rifampicin combination therapy experienced treatment failure.

Across trials, mild gastrointestinal side effects appeared to be more common with doxycycline than with comparator drugs; this finding does not derive from meta‐analysis but from narrative analysis of Table 5. When reported, serious adverse events were few.

### Doxycycline prophylaxis for bacterial sexually transmitted infections [^113U39tv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

CURRENT EVIDENCE ON DOXYCYCLINE PROPHYLAXIS

Doxycycline is a moderate-spectrum, second-generation tetracycline that is generally well tolerated. It is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration. First introduced commercially in the 1960s, doxycycline has been used by millions to manage acne and as primary prophylaxis for scrub typhus, leptospirosis, malaria, and Lyme disease. There are anecdotal reports of doxycycline used for syphilis prophylaxis among US and Australian military personnel during the Vietnam War. Doxycycline is a first-line agent for treatment of chlamydia and an alternative regimen for syphilis.

Several studies examined doxycycline prophylaxis for STI prevention (Table 1). In a small, open-label pilot study, 30 MSM living with HIV with prior syphilis were randomized 1:1 to daily doxycycline 100 mg as pre-exposure prophylaxis (Doxy PrEP) for 48 weeks versus a financial incentive–based behavioral intervention. There was a 73% reduction (P = 0.02) in syphilis, NG, or CT in the Doxy PrEP group compared with the control group. Most intervention-arm participants maintained blood doxycycline levels of greater than 1 μg/mL. Reported sexual behaviors were similar in both groups.

Tickborne rickettsial diseases — clinical priorities for diagnosis, treatment, and reporting emphasize familiarity with risk factors and early doxycycline use. To increase the likelihood of an early, accurate diagnosis, health care providers should be familiar with risk factors, signs, and symptoms consistent with tickborne rickettsial diseases. This report provides practical information to help health care providers and public health professionals to obtain an appropriate clinical history for suspected tickborne rickettsial diseases; recognize that early and empiric treatment with doxycycline can prevent severe morbidity or death; recognize doxycycline as the treatment of choice for adults and children of all ages with suspected rickettsial disease; recognize when to consider coinfection with other tickborne pathogens; determine appropriate confirmatory diagnostic tests for tickborne rickettsial diseases; advise patients regarding how to avoid tick bites; and report probable and confirmed cases to appropriate public health authorities to assist with surveillance, control measures, and public health education efforts.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2006). Low credibility.

Tickborne rickettsial diseases (TBRD) continue to cause severe illness and death in otherwise healthy adults and children, despite the availability of low cost, effective antimicrobial therapy. The greatest challenge to clinicians is the difficult diagnostic dilemma posed by these infections early in their clinical course, when antibiotic therapy is most effective. Early signs and symptoms of these illnesses are notoriously nonspecific or mimic benign viral illnesses, making diagnosis difficult. In October 2004, CDC's Viral and Rickettsial Zoonoses Branch, in consultation with 11 clinical and academic specialists of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, human granulocytotropic anaplasmosis, and human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis, developed guidelines to address the need for a consolidated source for the diagnosis and management of TBRD. The preparers focused on the practical aspects of epidemiology, clinical assessment, treatment, and laboratory diagnosis of TBRD. This report will assist clinicians and other health-care and public health professionals to 1) recognize epidemiologic features and clinical manifestations of TBRD, 2) develop a differential diagnosis that includes and ranks TBRD, 3) understand that the recommendations for doxycycline are the treatment of choice for both adults and children, 4) understand that early empiric antibiotic therapy can prevent severe morbidity and death, and 5) report suspect or confirmed cases of TBRD to local public health authorities to assist them with control measures and public health education efforts.

Lyme disease erythema migrans — treatment duration: We recommend that patients with erythema migrans be treated with either a 10-day course of doxycycline or a 14-day course of amoxicillin or cefuroxime axetil rather than longer treatment courses (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Comment: If azithromycin is used, the indicated duration is 5–10 days, with a 7-day course preferred in the United States, as this duration of therapy was used in the largest clinical trial performed in the United States. Evidence notes that durations in clinical studies have varied from 5 to 10 days, that 5-day regimens have included 6 doses with 2 doses taken on day 1, and that no difference in outcomes has been associated with the duration of therapy, including trials showing equivalent efficacy of 10 days compared with 20 days of doxycycline and similar efficacy of 10 days compared with 15 days. Rationale states that shorter durations of antibiotic exposure may reduce adverse effects and cost.

### Intravenous doxycycline, azithromycin, or both for severe scrub typhus [^116s3A35]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

The appropriate antibiotic treatment for severe scrub typhus, a neglected but widespread reemerging zoonotic infection, is unclear.

Methods

In this multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, we compared the efficacy of intravenous doxycycline, azithromycin, or a combination of both in treating severe scrub typhus. Patients who were 15 years of age or older with severe scrub typhus with at least one organ involvement were enrolled. The patients were assigned to receive a 7-day course of intravenous doxycycline, azithromycin, or both (combination therapy). The primary outcome was a composite of death from any cause at day 28, persistent complications at day 7, and persistent fever at day 5.

Results

Among 794 patients (median age, 48 years) who were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis, complications included those that were respiratory (in 62%), hepatic (in 54%), cardiovascular (in 42%), renal (in 30%), and neurologic (in 20%). The use of combination therapy resulted in a lower incidence of the composite primary outcome than the use of doxycycline (33% and 47%, respectively), for a risk difference of -13.3 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI] -21.6 to -5.1; P = 0.002). The incidence with combination therapy was also lower than that with azithromycin (48%), for a risk difference of -14.8 percentage points (95% CI, -23.1 to -6.5; P < 0.001). No significant difference was seen between the azithromycin and doxycycline groups (risk difference, 1.5 percentage points; 95% CI, -7.0 to 10.0; P = 0.73). The results in the per-protocol analysis were similar to those in the primary analysis. Adverse events and 28-day mortality were similar in the three groups.

Conclusions

Combination therapy with intravenous doxycycline and azithromycin was a better therapeutic option for the treatment of severe scrub typhus than monotherapy with either drug alone.

Tetracycline. Although doxycycline has replaced tetracycline as first-line treatment of tularemia in adults, tetracycline remains an acceptable second-line agent. The recommended dose of tetracycline is 500 mg every 6 hours orally for adults and 10 mg/kg every 6 hours orally (maximum 500 mg/dose) for children aged ≥ 8 years. Investigations of tetracycline performed in U.S. human volunteers during the 1950s–1960s found that among 44 volunteers exposed to airborne F. tularensis Schu S4 and treated 1–5 days after fever onset, all experienced complete recovery without relapse when treated with tetracycline 2 g/day for ≥ 14 days. Eight of these patients (18.2%) experienced a minor adverse event (e.g. transient increase in body temperature) after termination of tetracycline; however, symptoms spontaneously resolved in all patients. Volunteers treated with a lower dose (1 g/day) or shorter duration (10 days) of tetracycline had relapse rates of 25% and 45.5%, respectively and required subsequent treatment with streptomycin.

Conclusion

We could not establish statistical non-inferiority using the pre-specified margins when comparing efficacy on clinical improvement after 6 months in 2 and 6 weeks treatment with oral doxycycline in European LNB. Still, our study results strongly indicate that there is no added benefit of treatment beyond the 2 weeks in current guidelines.

Q fever treatment and management — summary recommendations state that because of the delay in seroconversion often necessary to confirm diagnosis, antibiotic treatment should never be withheld pending laboratory test results or discontinued on the basis of a negative acute specimen, and in contrast, treatment of chronic Q fever should be initiated only after diagnostic confirmation. Treatment for acute or chronic Q fever should only be provided for patients with clinically compatible cases and not based on elevated serologic titers alone. Doxycycline is the drug of choice, and 2 weeks of treatment is recommended for adults, children aged ≥ 8 years, and for severe infections in patients of any age. Children aged < 8 years with uncomplicated illness may be treated with trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole or a shorter duration (5 days) of doxycycline. Women who are pregnant when acute Q fever is diagnosed should be treated with trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole throughout the duration of pregnancy. Serologic monitoring is recommended after an acute Q fever infection to assess possible progression to chronic infection, and the recommended schedule for monitoring is based on the patient's risk for chronic infection.

INDICATIONS & USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Doxycycline for Injection, USP and other antibacterial drugs, Doxycycline for Injection, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Doxycycline for Injection, USP is indicated in infections caused by the following microorganisms:

Rickettsiae (Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus fever, and the typhus group, Q fever, rickettsial pox and tick fevers).

Mycoplasma pneumoniae (PPLO, Eaton Agent).

Agents of psittacosis and ornithosis.

Agents of lymphogranuloma venereum and granuloma inguinale.

The spirochetal agent of relapsing fever (Borrelia recurrentis).

The following gram-negative microorganisms:

Haemophilus ducreyi (chancroid).

Yersinia pestis (formerly Pasteurella pestis) and Francisella tularensis (formerly Pasteurella tularensis).

Bartonella bacilliformis.

Bacteroides species.

Vibrio cholerae (formerly Vibrio comma) and Campylobacter fetus (formerly Vibrio fetus).

Brucella species (in conjunction with streptomycin).

Because many strains of the following groups of microorganisms have been shown to be resistant to tetracyclines, culture and susceptibility testing are recommended.

### Doxycycline for malaria chemoprophylaxis and treatment: report from the CDC expert meeting on malaria chemoprophylaxis [^117BuEDT]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2011). Low credibility.

Special Populations

Children.

Doxcycycline is not recommended for children < 8 years of age because tetracyclines have been shown to cause permanent discoloration of the teeth. Tetracyclines form a complex with calcium orthophosphate that becomes incorporated into bones and teeth undergoing calcification. Tooth discoloration is permanent because remodeling and calcium exchange do not occur after calcification is completed. Some believe teeth staining is related to the total dose of tetracycline, while others argue that it is caused by repeated courses. It is also thought that timing of tetracycline administration during tooth development, especially during early dentin formation, determines the degree of discoloration. By 8 years of age the dentin and calcium-rich enamel has formed on almost all teeth (except wisdom teeth), and therefore doxycycline can be taken after this age. There are some who recommend that the lower age limit for taking doxycycline should be 12, when most children have had their primary teeth replaced by their adult dentition. Doxycycline, however, may cause less tooth discoloration than other tetracyclines because it has a lower binding affinity to calcium. In fact, one study found that a short course of doxycycline given to children for Rocky Mountain spotted fever did not cause clinically significant staining of teeth.

Of note, doxycycline is considered the drug of choice for treatment of infections in which the risks of tooth discoloration is outweighed by the benefit of disease treatment, such as presumed or confirmed rickettsial infection, ehrlichiosis, murine typhus, or inhalational anthrax.–Because there are other drug alternatives for treatment and prophylaxis of malaria in children < 8 years of age, use of doxycycline is not recommended.

The formation of the tetracycline and calcium orthophosphate complex in developing bone is thought to cause growth retardation, but the evidence is limited. Decreased long bone growth rate has been observed in premature infants given tetracycline but is reversible upon discontinuation of the drug. There are no studies showing tetracycline-induced growth retardation in term infants or older children.

Statistical analysis

The primary objective of the study was to determine if treatment duration of 2 weeks doxycycline is as effective as a prolonged regimen of 6 weeks. Accordingly, the null hypothesis was that 2 weeks treatment duration is inferior to 6 weeks treatment duration.

For the sample size calculation, the authors drafting the protocol considered a non-inferiority margin of 0.5 points in mean improvement on the CCS as clinically relevant. In other words, a mean difference in the clinical score from baseline to 6 months after inclusion of up to 0.5 points represented the maximum reduction in effectiveness we would accept, while still considering the short regimen treatment to be non-inferior. We used data from our previous trial with an adult population with European LNB and the same clinical score to calculate sample size and to determine the non-inferiority margin. With a significance level of 0.05 and statistical power at 80% this corresponded to a sample size of 50 patients in each group. To compensate for 20% drop-outs, we planned to include 120 patients, with 60 in each group.

For analyses of the primary endpoint, we applied a general linear model adjusting for gender, age, pretreatment duration of symptoms and CCS at baseline.

The primary endpoint was analysed in an intention-to-treat (ITT) principle population (excluding participants who withdrew consent, discontinued treatment and/or were lost to follow-up) and in a per-protocol population. In the latter, we also excluded one patient who fulfilled treatment according to protocol but was shown to have another diagnosis explaining the symptoms, and one patient who got a fatal additional disease and therefore scored unreasonably high on CCS.

Secondary endpoints, except safety issues, were compared between groups in the per-protocol population, applying independent samples t-tests, non-parametric tests or Pearson's χ² or Fisher's exact test for cross tabs as appropriate with a two-sided CI approach. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant.

We used the statistical program SPSS V.26 for analysis.

Diagnosis and management of tickborne rickettsial diseases — This report assists health care providers and public health professionals to recognize that doxycycline is the treatment of choice for suspected tickborne rickettsial diseases in adults and children, understand that early empiric antibacterial therapy can prevent severe disease and death, request the appropriate confirmatory diagnostic tests and understand their usefulness and limitations, and report probable and confirmed cases of tickborne rickettsial diseases to public health authorities. Recognition early in the clinical course is critical because this is the period when antibacterial therapy is most effective, and early signs and symptoms are nonspecific or mimic other illnesses, which can make diagnosis challenging. Tickborne rickettsial diseases continue to cause severe illness and death in otherwise healthy adults and children, despite the availability of low-cost, effective antibacterial therapy.

The frequency of permanent staining of teeth of young children from doxycycline is thought to be lower than from older tetracyclines, but the precise risk is uncertain. Until more definitive data become available, doxycycline should not be used routinely to treat young children with erythema migrans, a manifestation of Lyme disease for which other antimicrobials are highly effective.

### The rickettsioses: a practical update [^116MeyQq]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Rickettsia are small, obligately intracellular, gram-negative bacilli. They are distributed among a variety of hematophagous arthropod vectors and cause illness throughout the world. Rickettsioses present as an acute undifferentiated febrile illness and are often accompanied by headache, myalgias, and malaise. Cutaneous manifestations include rash and eschar, which both occur at varying incidence depending on the infecting species. Serology is the mainstay of diagnosis, and the indirect immunofluorescence assay is the test of choice. Reactive antibodies are seldom present during early illness, so testing should be performed on both acute-phase and convalescent-phase sera. Doxycycline is the treatment of choice.

Pediatric Patients

For all pediatric patients weighing less than 45 kg with severe or life-threatening infections (e.g., anthrax, Rocky Mountain spotted fever), the recommended dosage is 2.2 mg/kg of body weight administered every 12 hours. Children weighing 45 kg or more should receive the adult dose (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).

For pediatric patients with less severe disease (greater than 8 years of age and weighing less than 45 kg), the recommended dosage schedule is 4.4 mg/kg of body weight divided into two doses on the first day of treatment, followed by a maintenance dose of 2.2 mg/kg of body weight (given as a single daily dose or divided into twice daily doses). For pediatric patients weighing over 45 kg, the usual adult dose should be used.

In the treatment of inhalational anthrax (post-exposure) the recommended dose is 2.2 mg/kg of body weight, twice a day in children weighing less than 45 kg. Parenteral therapy is only indicated when oral therapy is not indicated and should not be continued over a prolonged period of time. Oral therapy should be instituted as soon as possible. Therapy must continue for a total of 60 days.

General

The duration of infusion may vary with the dose (100 to 200 mg/day), but is usually one to four hours. A recommended minimum infusion time for 100 mg of a 0.5 mg/mL solution is one hour. Therapy should be continued for at least 24 to 48 hours after symptoms and fever have subsided. The therapeutic antibacterial serum activity will usually persist for 24 hours following recommended dosage.

Intravenous solutions should not be injected intramuscularly or subcutaneously. Caution should be taken to avoid the inadvertent introduction of the intravenous solution into the adjacent soft tissue.

### Recognition of and prompt treatment for tick-borne infections in children [^117G4ETN]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Tick-borne infections create diagnostic challenges because they tend to present with nonspecific findings. Because clinicians often fail to recognize tick-borne illnesses in early stages, therapy is frequently delayed or omitted. This is especially problematic for rickettsial infections (Rocky Mountain spotted fever, ehrlichiosis, and anaplasmosis), because the risk of long-term morbidity and mortality increases with delayed treatment. We emphasize the need for clinicians to maintain a high index of suspicion for tick-borne infections; to diagnose these illnesses presumptively, without waiting for confirmatory laboratory test results; and to promptly start therapy with doxycycline, even in young children, when rickettsial infections are suspected.

Doxycycline allergy — severe doxycycline or tetracycline allergy in a patient with a suspected tickborne rickettsial disease places a challenge because of the lack of equally effective alternative antibacterial agents; in a patient reporting an allergy to a tetracycline-class drug, determining the type of adverse drug reaction and whether it is potentially life threatening (e.g., anaphylaxis or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) by history or medical documentation is important, and consultation with an allergy and immunology specialist could be helpful. In patients with non–life-threatening tetracycline-class drug reactions, administering doxycycline in an observed setting is an option; however, the risks and benefits should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. In patients with a life-threatening tetracycline allergy, options include use of alternative antibacterial agents discussed in the preceding section or rapid doxycycline desensitization.

The number of randomized participants ranged from 57 in Chanta 2015, to 296 in Phimda 2007. Five studies recruited adults only (n = 434); one study recruited people aged 14 and over (n = 57; Phimda 2007); and one study recruited children under the age of 15 (n = 57; Chanta 2015). All studies recruited males and females.

Four studies confirmed diagnosis using IFA only (Kim 2004; Kim 2007; Phimda 2007; Song 1995); one study confirmed diagnosis using IFA, agglutination testing, or isolation (Brown 1978); one study used only screening RDT for laboratory confirmation (Chanta 2015); and another study used screening RDT followed by confirmatory indirect immunoperoxidase (Watt 2000).

Two trials compared doxycycline and tetracycline (Brown 1978; Song 1995); and four trials compared doxycycline versus a macrolide (Chanta 2015; Kim 2004; Kim 2007; Phimda 2007). Chanta 2015 investigated children and used chloramphenicol in place of doxycycline for children under the age of eight but did not report results for chloramphenicol and doxycycline separately. One trial compared doxycycline alone, rifampicin alone at low and high doses, and doxycycline and rifampicin in combination (Watt 2000).

Included studies reported a variety of outcome measures and used different terminology to incorporate similar categories. With respect to our primary outcomes:

treatment failure: six studies provided data (Chanta 2015; Kim 2004; Kim 2007; Phimda 2007; Song 1995; Watt 2000). Definitions of treatment failure varied according to the persistence of fever and/or symptoms at time points including 48 hours, 72 hours, and after treatment completion; and
resolution of fever within 48 hours: two studies provided data (Brown 1978; Watt 2000).

With respect to our secondary outcomes:

resolution of fever within five days: three studies provided data (Kim 2004; Kim 2007; Phimda 2007);

Irrespective of recommendations, there are clues to substantial variations in clinical practice. In a Norwegian study of adherence to guidelines, 61% of patients with LNB were treated for more than 2 weeks, 36% for more than 3 weeks and 12% for more than 6 weeks.

Several factors are likely to influence choice of treatment duration, such as limited evidence in guidelines, local treatment cultures, beliefs and attitudes, and pressure and expectations from the patients due to advocacy in media for long duration of antibiotic treatment in LNB. High-quality research has been called for to pave the way for more evidence-based treatment decisions in the clinical practice.

In light of all this, we aimed to compare efficacy and safety of treatment with oral doxycycline for 2 and 6 weeks in European LNB in a randomised controlled trial. We chose a non-inferiority approach for assessment of efficacy as the short antibiotic regimen was not expected to be superior to the long regimen, but it still offers clear advantages in terms of antibiotic resistance issues, lower costs and less strain on the patients.

### Tick-borne diseases of the USA: ten things clinicians should know [^115r7RfV]. The Journal of Infection (2015). Low credibility.

This article highlights critical aspects of the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of tick-borne infections in children. Principles that apply broadly across the continental United States are emphasized, rather than details of each disease. Tick-borne infections are often confused with other, more common childhood illnesses, in part because of their nonspecific initial clinical findings and because patients are usually unaware of their preceding tick exposures. This is a problem, because delays in starting appropriate antibiotic therapy increase the likelihood of adverse outcomes from these infections, especially Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF). For patients in whom RMSF is a reasonable diagnostic consideration, therapy should be started presumptively, without awaiting the results of confirmatory diagnostic tests. For both adults and children, doxycycline is the drug of choice for RMSF and other American rickettsial infections. Concerns over the potential toxicity of doxycycline in young children are unfounded. Similarly groundless is the belief in "chronic Lyme disease" as an explanation for persistent nonspecific complaints after completing antibiotic therapy for Lyme disease. Prevention of tick-borne infections rests on avoidance of tick-bites and prompt removal of attached ticks. When used appropriately, insect repellents containing DEET are safe and effective for preventing tick exposures.

### Scrub typhus and the misconception of doxycycline resistance [^112YcjZv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Pharmacological factors will also determine treatment outcome. There is growing realization of the risks of poor-quality antibiotics and the potential risk for bias in clinical trials. Substandard formulation, in terms of inadequate doxycycline composition and bioavailability, would have reduced in vivo exposure of O. tsutsugamushi to doxycycline, leading to impaired clinical response. The ability of the drug to penetrate the intracellular compartment of O. tsutsugamushi –tropic cells, such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells and endothelial cells, is also crucial. Doxycycline and azithromycin both interfere with bacterial protein synthesis and both will affect the active replicative intracellular phase of the O. tsutsugamushi growth cycle. Both drugs concentrate well in the intracellular space of white blood cells but to different degrees; azithromycin cellular concentrations can be > 100 times higher than plasma or serum in healthy human volunteers, whereas doxycycline cellular concentrations may only reach around 10 times the values measured in the extracellular compartment. In the initial study comparing the susceptibility of AFSC-4 and Karp strains to doxycycline and azithromycin, azithromycin may have appeared to be more effective than doxycycline due its greater ability to concentrate in the intracellular space, an effect amplified by a shortened culture incubation period. Growing evidence for the efficacy of rifampicin in treating scrub typhus could be partially explained by the antibiotic's ability to concentrate well within white blood cells. There are suggestions that current doses of doxycycline may be suboptimal for the treatment of severe scrub typhus. Previous trials comparing the efficacy of different antibiotics in treating scrub typhus are limited by their heterogeneity and the fact that the majority were underpowered. The optimal choice of antibiotic for treatment remains unclear. Further pharmacological studies and high-quality clinical trials on the treatment of scrub typhus are urgently required.

Key points
- Doxycycline is the treatment of choice for all suspected rickettsial infections, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Rickettsia parkeririckettsiosis, Pacific Coast tick fever, and rickettsialpox.
- Empiric treatment with doxycycline is recommended in patients of all ages, particularly when a life-threatening disease such as RMSF is suspected.
- Treatment is most effective at preventing death and severe illness when doxycycline is started within the first 5 days of symptoms. Treatment recommendations Doxycycline is the first line treatment for adults and children of all ages, including pregnant women.
- **Adults over 45kg**: 100 mg every 12 hours
- **Children under 45 kg**:

2. 2 mg/kg body weight given twice a day. Patients should be treated for at least 5–7 days, and until 72 hours after the fever subsides and with evidence of clinical improvement.

Treating Children The use of doxycycline to treat suspected rickettsial disease in children is recommended by both CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases. If alternative antibiotics are considered, the choice of alternative antibiotic should be made after consulting with a specialist in infectious diseases. Keep Reading: Research: Doxycycline and Tooth Staining Doxycycline prophylaxis is not recommended Antibiotic prophylaxis after a tick bite is not recommended to prevent rickettsial infection. Persons who experience a tick bite should watch for symptoms suggestive of tickborne illness and consult a healthcare provider if fever, rash, headache, eschar, or other symptoms develop within 2 weeks of tick bite. Treatment timeline When a patient is treated within the first 5 days of illness, fever usually resolves within 24–48 hours.

In fact, failure to respond to doxycycline suggests that the patient's condition might not be caused by rickettsial infection. Severely ill patients may require longer periods before their fever resolves, especially if they have experienced damage to organ systems. Resistance to doxycycline or relapses in symptoms after the completion of the recommended course of treatment have not been documented.

Background

There is limited evidence regarding optimal duration of antibiotic treatment in neuroborreliosis. We aimed to compare efficacy and safety of oral doxycycline for 2 and 6 weeks in European Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB).

Methods

The trial had a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, non-inferiority design. Patients with LNB were recruited from eight Norwegian hospitals and randomised to doxycycline 200 mg once daily for 2 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of placebo, or doxycycline 200 mg once daily for 6 weeks. The primary endpoint was clinical improvement as measured by difference in a Composite Clinical Score (0–64 points) from baseline to 6 months. The non-inferiority margin was predetermined to 0.5 points.

Results

One hundred and twenty-one patients were included. Fifty-two treated for 2 weeks and 53 for 6 weeks were included in the intention-to-treat analyses, and 52 and 51 in per-protocol analysis. Mean difference in clinical improvement between the groups was 0.06, 95% CI −1.2 to 1.2, p = 0.99 in the intention-to-treat population, and −0.4, 95% CI −1.4 to 0.7, p = 0.51 in the per-protocol population and non-inferiority could not be established. There were no treatment failures and no serious adverse events. The groups did not differ in secondary outcomes including clinical scores at 10 weeks and 12 months, cerebrospinal fluid data and patient-reported outcome measures. Patients receiving 6 weeks doxycycline reported slightly more side effects in week 5.

Conclusion

Our results strongly indicate that there are no benefits of doxycycline treatment beyond 2 weeks in European LNB.

### Diagnosis and management of tickborne rickettsial diseases: rocky mountain spotted fever and other spotted fever group rickettsioses, ehrlichioses, and anaplasmosis-United States [^115byxBq]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Tickborne rickettsial diseases continue to cause severe illness and death in otherwise healthy adults and children, despite the availability of low-cost, effective antibacterial therapy. Recognition early in the clinical course is critical because this is the period when antibacterial therapy is most effective. Early signs and symptoms of these illnesses are nonspecific or mimic other illnesses, which can make diagnosis challenging. Previously undescribed tickborne rickettsial diseases continue to be recognized, and since 2004, three additional agents have been described as causes of human disease in the United States: Rickettsia parkeri, Ehrlichia muris-like agent, and Rickettsia species 364D. This report updates the 2006 CDC recommendations on the diagnosis and management of tickborne rickettsial diseases in the United States and includes information on the practical aspects of epidemiology, clinical assessment, treatment, laboratory diagnosis, and prevention of tickborne rickettsial diseases. The CDC Rickettsial Zoonoses Branch, in consultation with external clinical and academic specialists and public health professionals, developed this report to assist health care providers and public health professionals to 1) recognize key epidemiologic features and clinical manifestations of tickborne rickettsial diseases, 2) recognize that doxycycline is the treatment of choice for suspected tickborne rickettsial diseases in adults and children, 3) understand that early empiric antibacterial therapy can prevent severe disease and death, 4) request the appropriate confirmatory diagnostic tests and understand their usefulness and limitations, and 5) report probable and confirmed cases of tickborne rickettsial diseases to public health authorities.

Tickborne rickettsial diseases — treatment course and monitoring indicate that "the minimum total course of treatment is 5–7 days". "Severe or complicated disease could require longer treatment courses", and for anaplasmosis, "Patients with anaplasmosis should be treated with doxycycline for 10 days". Early clinical response is expected, as "Fever typically subsides within 24–48 hours after treatment when the patient receives doxycycline in the first 4–5 days of illness", but "Lack of clinical response within 48 hours of early treatment with doxycycline could be an indication that the condition is not a tickborne rickettsial disease", while "Severely ill patients might require > 48 hours of treatment before clinical improvement is noted". Hospital care is advised when "Patients with evidence of organ dysfunction, severe thrombocytopenia, mental status changes, or the need for supportive therapy should be hospitalized", and "Vasopressors and careful fluid management might be needed when the illness is complicated by hypotension or renal failure", with specialist input as "Consultation with an intensive care or infectious disease specialist could be helpful". For outpatients, "A critical step is for clinicians to keep in close contact", and "if a 24-hour watch-and-wait approach is taken… ensuring close patient follow-up is essential", since "Patients should be monitored closely because of the potential for rapid decline… especially among those with RMSF".

Combined, "a tooth staining prevalence rate of 0% (none of the 89 patients; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0%–3%)" was observed, and "The use of doxycycline to treat children with suspected tickborne rickettsial disease should no longer be a subject of controversy".

### Treatment of erythema migrans with doxycycline for 7 days versus 14 days in Slovenia: a randomised open-label non-inferiority trial [^115tVWUF]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Background

Lyme borreliosis is the most prevalent vector-borne disease in Europe and the USA. Doxycycline for 10 days is the primary treatment recommendation for erythema migrans. To reduce potentially harmful antibiotic overuse by identifying shorter effective treatments, we aimed to assess whether oral doxycycline for 7 days is non-inferior to 14 days in adults with solitary erythema migrans.

Methods

In this randomised open-label non-inferiority trial, we enrolled patients with a solitary erythema at the University Medical Centre in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Patients were excluded if they were pregnant or lactating, immunosuppressed, allergic to doxycycline, or had received antibiotics with anti-borrelial activity within 10 days preceding enrolment or had additional manifestations of Lyme borreliosis Adults were randomly allocated 1:1 to receive oral doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 7 days or 14 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference in proportion of patients with treatment failure, defined as persistent erythema, new objective signs of Lyme borreliosis, or borrelial isolation on skin re-biopsy at 2 months, in a per-protocol analysis (the population that completed the assigned doxycycline regimen according to the study protocol and did not receive any other antibiotics with anti-borrelial activity until the 2-month visit). The non-inferiority margin was 6 percentage points. Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned patients who followed the study protocol and were evaluable at the 14-day visit. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03153267.

Findings

Between July 3, 2017, and Oct 2, 2018, we enrolled 300 patients (150 per group: median age 56 years [IQR 47–65]; 126 [45%] of 300 male; skin culture positive 72 [30%] of 239 assessed). 295 patients completed antibiotic therapy as per protocol and 294 (98%) patients were evaluable 2 months post-enrolment. Five (3%) of 147 patients from the 7-day group versus 3 (2%) of 147 patients from the 14-day group (one patient did not attend the 2-month visit and was unreachable by telephone) had treatment failure manifesting as persistence of erythema (difference 1.4 percentage points; upper limit of one-sided 95% CI 5.2 percentage points; p = 0.64). No patients developed new objective manifestations of Lyme borreliosis during follow-up or had positive repeat skin biopsies. Two (1%) of 150 patients in the 7-day and one (1%) of 150 patients in the 14-day group discontinued therapy due to adverse events.

Interpretation

Our data support 7 days of oral doxycycline for adult European patients with solitary erythema migrans, permitting less antibiotic exposure than current guideline-driven therapy.
