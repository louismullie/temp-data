## Question

A 32-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after being stranded in subzero temperatures for several hours. On examination, he has pale, hard, and numb fingers on both hands. Rapid rewarming in a water bath at 40°C has been performed, and the affected tissues are now thawed, appearing erythematous and swollen. You are preparing to dress his hands.

According to current guidelines, what topical agent should be applied to the thawed tissue before dressing, and what is the rationale for its use?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which topical agent should be applied to thawed frostbitten tissue before dressing and why, with supporting guidelines and rationale. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and whether the tissue is appropriately thawed. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend for topical therapy after thawing. Next, I will examine the mechanistic rationale for that agent. After that, I need to check dosing, application frequency, and how to integrate it with dressing technique. Finally, I will consider alternatives and note any caveats or exceptions, anchoring to Wilderness Medical Society and American Burn Association guidance.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and that the key prerequisites are met: the patient has frostbite of the hands, rapid rewarming has been completed, and the tissue is now thawed, erythematous, and swollen, which signals progression into the vascular stasis and inflammatory phases where local care can mitigate ongoing injury. I should confirm that guidelines prioritize protecting thawed tissue and avoiding refreezing, which they do, and that topical therapy is indicated after thawing rather than before, which aligns with WMS and ABA recommendations [^dc4f9341] [^fd856af3].

> Next, I should review what the guidelines say about a specific topical agent. Multiple high-credibility sources converge on topical aloe vera cream or gel applied to thawed tissue before dressings, with WMS 2019 and 2024 updates explicitly recommending aloe vera be applied to thawed tissue and reapplied at each dressing change or every 6 hours, and the American Burn Association including aloe vera among early medical advances in frostbite care. ACCP-aligned reviews also endorse aloe vera as a standard topical for thawed tissue, reinforcing this as the consensus choice [^dc4f9341] [^a1e9548c] [^bc15de07] [^7d177c2c] [^610198e7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the mechanistic rationale. The benefit of aloe vera is attributed to its antiprostaglandin and antithromboxane effects, which can blunt the inflammatory cascade and microvascular thrombosis that drive progressive tissue loss after thawing. WMS notes supportive data from an observational study and an animal model, while acknowledging that topical agents have limited penetration and thus are most relevant for superficially injured areas, which fits the pathophysiology of early frostbite with dermal involvement [^dc4f9341] [^45f40af2].

> I need to ensure dosing and application details are precise. WMS recommends applying aloe vera cream or gel to thawed tissue before dressings and then reapplying at each dressing change or approximately every 6 hours; this cadence balances sustained local effect with practical wound care. I should double-check that this applies in both field and hospital settings, and yes, the 2024 update maintains the same cadence across contexts [^a1e9548c] [^bc15de07].

> Next, I should review how to integrate this with dressing technique, because improper dressings can undo benefit. WMS advises bulky, dry, clean dressings applied loosely to accommodate anticipated edema and to protect from mechanical trauma; circumferential wraps should not constrict, and digits should be separated with gauze to prevent maceration. I should confirm that this approach is consistent with first-aid guidance, which similarly recommends bulky, clean, dry dressings and loose wrapping to allow swelling, aligning with WMS practice [^02fa8ae0] [^57a4b1f9].

> But wait, what if aloe vera is not available or there are special circumstances? I should consider alternatives and caveats. WMS notes that while aloe vera is the recommended topical, evidence quality is low and topical agents have limited penetration, so if aloe vera is unavailable, prioritizing meticulous wound care, protection, and systemic measures like ibuprofen and advanced therapies when indicated is reasonable. I should also confirm that routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended in the absence of infection, which WMS and CDC emphasize, reserving antibiotics for proven infection or significant contamination [^dc4f9341] [^5a00ddbe] [^ca6f793b].

> Final answer, keeping it clinically actionable: Apply topical aloe vera cream or gel to the thawed, erythematous, and swollen fingers before dressing, and reapply at each dressing change or about every 6 hours. The rationale is to mitigate prostaglandin- and thromboxane-mediated inflammatory vasoconstriction and microthrombosis that perpetuate tissue ischemia after thawing, thereby potentially reducing tissue loss in superficially injured areas, while pairing this with bulky, dry, loosely wrapped dressings to protect and accommodate edema [^a1e9548c] [^bc15de07] [^dc4f9341] [^02fa8ae0].

---

Apply **topical aloe vera** to thawed frostbitten tissue before dressing. Aloe vera reduces prostaglandin and thromboxane formation, thereby limiting inflammation and thrombosis that worsen tissue injury [^dc4f9341] [^45f40af2]. Use a **thin layer of aloe vera cream or gel** and reapply at each dressing change or every 6 hours [^a1e9548c] [^bc15de07]. Cover with **bulky, dry, sterile dressings** wrapped loosely to allow for swelling and to protect the tissue [^02fa8ae0] [^57a4b1f9]. Avoid topical antibiotics unless infection is present, as they are not routinely indicated [^5a00ddbe].

---

## Rationale for topical aloe vera application

Aloe vera is recommended because it **reduces prostaglandin and thromboxane formation**, mediators of inflammation and thrombosis that contribute to tissue ischemia and necrosis after thawing [^dc4f9341] [^45f40af2]. This antiprostaglandin effect may limit progressive tissue damage and improve outcomes in superficial frostbite [^dc4f9341].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting aloe vera use

Evidence supporting aloe vera is based on **observational and animal studies** demonstrating reduced tissue loss and improved healing, though high-quality randomized trials are limited [^dc4f9341] [^45f40af2]. The Wilderness Medical Society (WMS) and American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) recommend topical aloe vera for frostbite care based on this evidence and its favorable risk profile [^dc4f9341] [^610198e7].

---

## Application method and frequency

- **Application**: Apply a thin layer of aloe vera cream or gel to the thawed tissue before dressing [^a1e9548c] [^bc15de07].
- **Frequency**: Reapply at each dressing change or every 6 hours [^a1e9548c] [^bc15de07].
- **Coverage**: Ensure the entire affected area is covered, including between fingers or toes [^notfound].

---

## Dressing technique and precautions

- **Dressing**: Use bulky, dry, sterile gauze dressings to protect the tissue and absorb moisture [^02fa8ae0] [^57a4b1f9].
- **Wrapping**: Wrap loosely to accommodate swelling and avoid constriction [^02fa8ae0] [^57a4b1f9].
- **Separation**: Place gauze between digits to prevent maceration and adhesion [^notfound].

---

## Additional considerations

- **Pain control**: Administer NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen 12 mg/kg divided twice daily) to reduce inflammation and control pain [^c64512ce] [^97df6bb9].
- **Infection prevention**: Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not indicated unless infection is present [^5a00ddbe] [^ca6f793b].
- **Monitoring**: Regularly reassess for infection, ischemia, or progression of injury [^fd856af3].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Intervention** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Topical agent | Aloe vera cream or gel |
| Application frequency | Every 6 hours or at each dressing change |
| Dressing | Bulky, dry, sterile gauze, loosely wrapped |
| Additional measures | NSAIDs for pain and inflammation; monitor for infection |

---

Topical aloe vera is the **preferred agent** for frostbite care after rapid rewarming, applied before dressings to reduce inflammation and thrombosis; pair this with bulky, dry dressings and vigilant monitoring for complications [^a1e9548c] [^02fa8ae0].

Purpose and scope — treatment of severe frostbite: The purpose of this CPG is to make recommendations, based on the available scientific literature, on the treatment of severe frostbite. Early medical advances in frostbite treatment include rapid rewarming, oral ibuprofen, topical aloe vera, pressure relief, and wound care. A major advancement in the science of frostbite treatment occurred with the use of thrombolytics to reduce the injury caused by reperfusion following rewarming. The philosophy that "time is tissue" in frostbite injury makes the rapid identification, initiation of therapy, and potential transfer to a higher level of care essential to reduce significant morbidity. These guidelines do not define the standard of care for acute severe frostbite diagnosis and management and should not be viewed as prescriptive in nature. These guidelines are based on a systematic review and evaluation of the quality of available evidence that address the specific PICO questions and are intended only to help guide clinicians who care for patients with acute severe frostbite. Basic clinical judgment is always prioritized in the care of an individual patient with an acute frostbite injury.

Specific recommendations — Scenario 2 (thawing and continued warming), topical aloe vera — aloe vera ointment has been shown in an observational study and an animal model to improve frostbite outcome by reducing prostaglandin and thromboxane formation, but topical agents do not penetrate far into tissues so aloe vera is theoretically only beneficial for superficially injured areas. The study supporting the benefit of aloe vera examined its application on unroofed blebs, and topical aloe vera should be applied to thawed tissue before application of dressings. Recommendation Grade: 2C.

Background

Frostbite is a thermal injury caused when tissue is exposed to sub-zero temperatures (in degrees Celsius) long enough for ice crystals to form in the affected tissue. Depending on the degree of tissue damage, thrombosis, ischaemia, necrosis (tissue death), gangrene and ultimately amputation may occur. Several interventions for frostbite injuries have been proposed, such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy, sympathectomy (nerve block), thrombolytic (blood-thinning) therapy and vasodilating agents such as iloprost, reserpine, pentoxifylline and buflomedil, but the benefits and harms of these interventions are unclear.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of the different management options for frostbite injuries.

Search Methods

On 25 February 2020, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid MEDLINE(R) In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid OLDMEDLINE(R), Embase (OvidSP), ISI Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED), Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S), as well as trials registers. Shortly before publication, we searched Clinicaltrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, OpenGrey and GreyLit (9 November 2020) again. We investigated references from relevant articles, and corresponded with a trial author.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared any medical intervention, e.g. pharmacological therapy, topical treatments or rewarming techniques, for frostbite injuries to another treatment, placebo or no treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data. We used Review Manager 5 for statistical analysis of dichotomous data with risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool to assess bias in the included trial. We assessed incidence of amputations, rates of serious and non-serious adverse events, acute pain, chronic pain, ability to perform activities of daily living, quality of life, withdrawal rate from medical therapy due to adverse events, occupational effects and mortality. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We included one, open-label randomised trial involving 47 participants with severe frostbite injuries. We judged this trial to be at high risk of bias for performance bias, and uncertain risk for attrition bias; all other risk of bias domains we judged as low. All participants underwent rapid rewarming, received 250 mg of aspirin and 400 mg intravascular (IV) buflomedil (since withdrawn from practice), and were then randomised to one of three treatment groups for the following eight days. Group 1 received additional IV buflomedil 400 mg for one hour per day. Group 2 received the prostacyclin, iloprost, 0.5 ng to 2 ng/kg/min IV for six hours per day. Group 3 received IV iloprost 2 ng/kg/min for six hours per day plus fibrinolysis with 100 mg recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) for the first day only. The results suggest that iloprost and iloprost plus rtPA may reduce the rate of amputations in people with severe frostbite compared to buflomedil alone, RR 0.05 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.78; P = 0.03; very low-quality evidence) and RR 0.31 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.94; P = 0.04; very low-quality evidence), respectively. Iloprost may be as effective as iloprost plus rtPA at reducing the amputation rate, RR 0.14 (95% CI 0.01 to 2.56; P = 0.19; very low-quality evidence). There were no reported deaths or withdrawals due to adverse events in any of the groups; we assessed evidence for both outcomes as being of very low quality. Adverse events (including flushing, nausea, palpitations and vomiting) were common, but not reported separately by comparator arm (very low-quality evidence). The included study did not measure the outcomes of acute pain, chronic pain, ability to perform activities of daily living, quality of life or occupational effects.

Authors' Conclusions

There is a paucity of evidence regarding interventions for frostbite injuries. Very low-quality evidence from a single small trial indicates that iloprost, and iloprost plus rtPA, in combination with buflomedil may reduce the need for amputation in people with severe frostbite compared to buflomedil alone. However, buflomedil has been withdrawn from use. High quality randomised trials are needed to establish firm evidence for the treatment of frostbite injuries.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for frostbite, more specifically with respect to active rewarming, ACCP 2014 guidelines recommend to initiate rewarming if there remains a partially or fully frozen part. Perform rewarming ideally using a whirlpool bath set at 38 °C with added antiseptic solution (povidone iodine or chlorhexidine) for 15–30 minutes (up to 1 hour).

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of frostbite: 2019 update [^90bee4d6]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Specific recommendations — Scenario 2 (thawing and continued warming), antiseptic solution — most injuries do not become infected, but adding an antiseptic solution (eg, povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine) to the rewarming water has theoretical benefits of reducing skin bacteria; evidence for this practice does not exist for frostbite care. Adding an antiseptic solution to the water while rewarming is unlikely to be harmful and might reduce the risk for cellulitis if severe edema is present in the affected extremity. Recommendation Grade: 2C.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of frostbite: 2019 update [^328c78c5]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Specific recommendations — Scenario 2 (thawing and continued warming), spontaneous or passive thawing — according to the foregoing guidelines, rapid rewarming is strongly recommended. If field rewarming is not possible, spontaneous or slow thawing should be allowed, accomplished by moving to a warmer location and warming with adjacent body heat from the patient or a caregiver. The expert panel agrees that slow thawing is a reasonable course of action to initiate the rewarming process if it is the only means available. Recommendation Grade: 1C.

Specific recommendations — Scenario 2 (thawing and continued warming), debridement of blisters — debridement of blisters should not be routinely performed in the field. If a clear, fluid-filled blister is tense and at high risk for rupture during evacuation, blister aspiration and application of a dry gauze dressing should be performed in the field, whereas hemorrhagic bullae should not be aspirated or debrided in the field. These recommendations are common practice but lack evidence beyond case series. Recommendation Grade: 2C.

### Frostbite of the hand [^b72058c7]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Frostbite is damage caused by the freezing of tissue owing to exposure to extreme cold. Clinically, it is often difficult to identify the severity of frostbite injury. There may be a wide discrepancy between the extent of damage to the skin versus that to the deeper structures. The initial clinical impression is usually worse than actual tissue damage. In addition to physical examination, diagnostic imaging, especially triple-phase bone scan, has been proposed to help differentiate between superficial and deep damage. Principles of treatment involve rapid rewarming to thaw the tissues and halt direct cellular damage, methods to minimize progressive dermal ischemia, and active wound care to promote timely healing. Pharmacological adjuncts, such as fibrinolytics, have been proposed to minimize tissue damage. Surgical therapy is postponed until there is clear demarcation between healthy and necrotic tissue.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of frostbite: 2024 update [^d2fd3c02]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Frostbite refreezing risk and thawing approach — scenarios and directives: If thawed tissue could refreeze, it is safer to keep the part frozen until a thawed state can be maintained, and one must absolutely avoid refreezing if field thawing occurs (Recommendation: Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Most frostbite thaws spontaneously and can be allowed to do so if rapid rewarming is not readily achievable; warming against warm body parts may be used if rapid rewarming is not possible, and tissue should not be intentionally kept below freezing; if conditions allow, tissue should be allowed to thaw (Recommendation: Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). Strategies for Scenario 1 ("The frozen part has the potential for refreezing and is not actively thawed.") and Scenario 2 ("The frozen part is thawed and kept warm without refreezing until evacuation is completed.") are presented.

### Frostbite: a practical approach to hospital management [^0dbdde6c]. Extreme Physiology & Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for frostbite, more specifically with respect to passive thawing, ACCP 2014 guidelines recommend to recognize that the decision to thaw the frostbitten tissue in the field commits to a course of action, including pain control, maintaining warm water baths at a constant temperature, protecting tissue from further injury during rewarming and eventual transport. Consider letting patients walk on a frozen limb to safety rather than risk refreezing in extreme circumstances.

Frostbite — first aid management emphasizes that frostbite is a potentially tissue-threatening injury, advanced treatment such as thrombolytic medication can be administered only in a health care setting and is most effective when given soon after injury, and tissue of the frozen extremities will swell, so it is recommended to remove constricting items such as jewelry and tight clothing. Frostbite is a common finding in hypothermic individuals; rewarming the core of the person with hypothermia is the treatment priority, and rewarming the extremities first can cause the core temperature to decrease. Because acute frostbite limits sensation and awareness of damage, experts recommend that frostbitten tissues be protected and that frostbitten hands and feet not be used for climbing or walking whenever it is avoidable. Local care includes applying bulky dressings that insulate and protect tissue, using clean and dry dressings to absorb moisture, and using loose, circumferential wrapping to allow for swelling and prevent constriction of blood flow; bulky dressings also distribute pressure more evenly to reduce localized pressure points. NSAIDs decrease production of mediators that can worsen tissue damage, and ibuprofen is recommended by many experts and included in many treatment guidelines, although direct clinical evidence is lacking. Intact skin is an essential barrier for infection, and whenever possible, intact epidermal layers should be left intact.

Frostbite scenario 2 — rapid field rewarming by warm water bath: field rewarming should only be undertaken if the frozen part can be kept thawed and warm until definitive care and may be performed by warm water bath immersion when proper resources are available and definitive care is more than 2 h distant; other heat sources should be avoided. Water should be heated to 37°C to 39°C (98.6 to 102.2°F) and, if no thermometer is available, safety can be checked by placing a caregiver's uninjured hand in the water for at least 30 s. Rewarming is generally complete when the part becomes red or purple, soft, and pliable, usually in approximately 30 min. Recommendation: Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.

First aid for frostbite — additional care steps and cautions: A person with frostbite should seek prompt medical attention. Jewelry or other constricting materials should be removed from a frostbitten extremity as soon as possible. A person with moderate to severe hypothermia should receive core rewarming before frostbite is treated. If possible, a person should protect frostbitten tissue from further injury and avoid walking on frozen feet and toes. For frozen and thawed tissue and between the toes and fingers, bulky, clean, dry gauze or sterile cotton dressings should be applied. Circumferential dressings should be wrapped loosely to allow for swelling without placing pressure on the underlying tissue. It may be reasonable to give ibuprofen to a person with frostbite to prevent further tissue damage and to treat pain. It is not recommended for first aid providers to debride blisters associated with frostbite.

This Clinical Practice Guideline addresses severe frostbite treatment. We defined severe frostbite as atmospheric cooling that results in a perfusion deficit to the extremities. We limited our review to adults and excluded cold contact or rapid freeze injuries that resulted in isolated devitalized tissue. After developing population, intervention, comparator, outcomes (PICO) questions, a comprehensive literature search was conducted with the help of a professional medical librarian. Available literature was reviewed and systematically evaluated. Recommendations based on the available scientific evidence were formulated through consensus of a multidisciplinary committee. We conditionally recommend the use of rapid rewarming in a 38 to 42°C water bath and the use of thrombolytics for fewer amputations and/or a more distal level of amputation. We conditionally recommend the use of "early" administration of thrombolytics (≤ 12 hours from rewarming) compared to "later" administration of thrombolytics for fewer amputations and/or a more distal level of amputation. No recommendation could be formed on the use of vascular imaging studies to determine the use of and/or the time to initiate thrombolytic therapy. No recommendation could be formed on the use of intravenous thrombolytics compared to the use of intra-arterial thrombolytics on fewer amputations and/or a more distal level of amputation. No recommendation could be formed on the use of iloprost resulting in fewer amputations and/or more distal levels of amputation. No recommendation could be formed on the use of diagnostic imaging modalities for surgical planning on fewer amputations, a more distal level of amputation, or earlier timing of amputation.

Frostbite post-rewarming management — after rewarming, edema and clear or hemorrhagic blisters may form, and hemorrhagic bullae or cyanosis without blister formation imply deep tissue infarction, so appearance helps guide evacuation and advanced imaging and treatment decisions. Clean, dress, and pad injuries to protect against mechanical trauma, placing dressings loosely in anticipation of further tissue swelling. Treatment with anti-inflammatory doses of ibuprofen (400 mg, twice daily) and aloe vera ointment or gel may be useful; in most cases, antibiotic prophylaxis is not indicated. Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) scintigraphy and magnetic resonance imaging guide treatment and predict need for surgery and extent of tissue loss for patients with 3rd or 4th degree injuries. Some advanced care settings employ protocols for the administration of thrombolytic agents or iloprost (approved by the FDA in February 2024 for use in frostbite), but their use requires treatment within 48–72 hours of tissue thawing. Consultation with a clinician with experience treating frostbite optimizes outcomes in management of deep frostbite injury.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^1ae634d5]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Frostbite rewarming rationale — animal model studies indicate that water temperature slightly above normal body temperature (37–40°C [99–104°F]) is best for rapid rewarming with a warm-water immersion technique, and in one study rapid rewarming with warm water (45°C [113°F]) was harmful. More recent human patient case series have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of warming frostbitten tissue in the range of 37°C to 40°C for between 20 and 30 minutes, and if a thermometer is not available, water temperature can be tested against one's wrist, where it should feel slightly warmer than body temperature. The mechanism of tissue damage in frostbite is the development of ice crystals in cells, which can destroy cell membrane integrity; as a result, it is widely recommended that tissue refreezing be strictly avoided and that in-field rewarming be considered only if the risk of refreezing is negligible. Limbs left to thaw spontaneously at 27°C to 29°C (81°F–84°F) also had good outcomes, and air rewarming can be used as an alternative rewarming method when warm water immersion is not possible.

Specific recommendations — Scenario 2 (thawing and continued warming), rapid field rewarming of frostbite — field rewarming by warm water bath immersion can and should be performed if the proper resources are available and definitive care is more than 2 h distant, and other heat sources (eg, fire, space heater, oven, heated rocks) should be avoided. Water should be heated to 37 to 39°C (98.6 to 102.2°F), using a thermometer to maintain this range; if a thermometer is not available, a safe water temperature can be determined by placing a caregiver's uninjured hand in the water for at least 30 s. Rewarming is complete when the involved part takes on a red or purple appearance and becomes soft and pliable to the touch, which is usually accomplished in approximately 30 min. Under appropriate circumstances, this method of field rewarming is the first definitive step in frostbite treatment. Recommendation Grade: 1B.

American Burn Association clinical practice guideline — reporting standards and registry dataset for severe frostbite emphasize outcome reporting and standardized variables. We would recommend a minimum report including per person amputation and an overall salvage rate, and severity of injury should be obtained by imaging or bedside perfusion test after rewarming, with reporting of the timing of rewarming, time to post-rewarming testing, and post-rewarming treatment; additionally, delayed imaging may be used as an alternative outcome measure. To address research priorities, implementation of a standard frostbite dataset for registries could significantly improve research and outcomes and could be best achieved through the ABA, and these variables should include: measure of severity of frostbite injury after rewarming and documentation of method of measurement; documentation of use or non-use of rapid rewarming in a water bath; description of any use of thrombolytics and method of delivery; recorded time from admission to thrombolysis; documentation of use of any continued anticoagulation and the length of time it was used; and time to surgical management on primary admission or subsequent admissions.

### Use of intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy for acute treatment of frostbite in 62 patients with review of thrombolytic therapy in frostbite [^83485a6c]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2015). Low credibility.

Blood flow usually resumes after thawing, but may be diminished by edema, vasospasm, or thrombosis. Damaged endothelium in the arterioles will desquamate, occluding the capillary bed and leaving a thrombogenic basement membrane. The endothelium also releases vasoactive inflammatory mediators including thromboxane A2, prostaglandin F2-alpha, bradykinin, and histamine. Progressive thrombosis with occlusion of the small arterial collaterals precedes demarcation of tissue infarction. And if the injured tissue refreezes, the swollen and very fragile cells quickly rupture, making the patients poor candidates for thrombolytic therapy.

Because an anoxic reperfusion injury is likely if frozen tissue thaws slowly, the most effective treatment for acute frostbite is rapid rewarming, but 25% of our patients presented after thawing the extremity. Clinically, return of blood flow is indicated by pink skin and warm digits. Large blisters will form beneath the damaged epidermis only where fluid leaks from perfused capillaries. Minimal blisters form where blood flow is absent, and the distal digits become gray or cyanotic, often with hemorrhagic blisters forming proximally. These patients are candidates for thrombolytic therapy.

### What interventional radiologists need to know about managing severe frostbite: a meta-analysis of thrombolytic therapy [^121e1e68]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2020). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study is to review the various techniques and clinical management paradigms using tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) to treat severe frostbite injuries, which are relevant to the interventional radiologist. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A literature search yielded 157 citations, which were manually screened for inclusion criteria of case reports, case series, cohort studies, and randomized prospective studies that reported the use of tPA to treat severe frostbite injuries, of which 16 qualified for review. Data extracted from the studies included authors, journal, year of publication, initial assessment and management of severe frostbite injuries, inclusion and exclusion criteria for tPA therapy, treatment and control group size, different imaging modalities used in evaluation of severe frostbite injuries, tPA treatment protocols, outcomes, and side effects or complications. RESULTS. The analyzed series included 209 patients with 1109 digits at risk of amputation who were treated with intraarterial (IA) or IV tPA (116 and 77 patients, respectively). A total of 926 digits at risk were treated with IA tPA and resulted in amputation of 222 digits, for a salvage rate of 76%. Twenty-four of 63 patients underwent amputation after IV tPA, resulting in a salvage rate of 62%. Both digital subtraction angiography and triple-phase bone scan were used for initial imaging evaluation. Additional concurrent treatment included therapeutic heparin, warfarin, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, pain management, and light dressings with topical antimicrobial agents. CONCLUSION. Severe frostbite injuries can lead to devastating outcomes with loss of limbs and digits, yet clinical management continues to consist primarily of tissue rewarming, prolonged watchful waiting, and often delayed amputation. Recent studies have shown promising results using both IA and IV tPA to reduce amputation after severe frostbite injuries. Through a meta-analysis of thrombolytic therapy in the management of severe frostbite, this article provides a useful guideline for interventional radiologists including a suggested protocol, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and potential complications.

The treatment of severe frostbite injury has undergone rapid development in the past 30 years with many different diagnostic and treatment options now available. However, there is currently no consensus on the best method for management of this disease process. At our institution, we have designed a protocol for severe frostbite injury that includes diagnosis, medical treatment, wound cares, therapy, and surgery. This study assess the efficacy of our treatment since its implementation six years ago. During this time, all patients with severe frostbite injury were included in prospective observational trial of the protocol. We found that this protocol results in significant tissue salvage with over 80.7% of previously ischemic tissue becoming viable and not requiring amputation. We also were able to improve our center's efficiency over the course of six years and now our current average time from rapid rewarming to delivery of thrombolytics is under six hours.

Objectives

Frostbite refers to the freezing of body tissue which is caused by prolonged exposure to cold temperatures and results in tissue destruction. Tissue damage is due to both immediate cold-induced cell death and the more gradual development of localized inflammatory processes and tissue ischemia. A detailed treatment plan based on the current UpToDate literature is needed to decrease morbidity and mortality rates.

Methods

The United States National Library of Medicine (PubMed/Medline), EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were systematically searched to identify publications relevant to this review.

Conclusion

In this review, we present the current knowledge on the diagnosis and treatment of frostbite injuries. We then provide an extended and detailed treatment plan, from first aid in the field to treatment of short and long-term complications.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Inform patients that accidental exposure to capsaicin from touching QUTENZA or items exposed to capsaicin can cause severe irritation of eyes, mucous membranes, respiratory tract, and skin.
Instruct patients not to touch their eyes and other unintended target area and that if irritation of eyes or airways occurs, or if any of the side effects become severe, to notify their doctor immediately.
Inform patients that acute pain during and after the QUTENZA application procedure may be treated with local cooling or analgesic medication, as appropriate. Inform patients of the potential risk for frostbite with excessive use of cooling. It is recommended to use cooling packs from the refrigerator (not from the freezer) and to avoid direct application to the skin.
Advise patients to seek medical attention if they experience persistent severe pain or skin lesions such as blisters after the QUTENZA application procedure.
Inform patients that, as a result of treatment-related increases in pain, small transient increases in blood pressure may occur during and shortly after QUTENZA treatment and that blood pressure will be monitored during the treatment procedure. Instruct patients to inform the physician if they have experienced any recent cardiovascular events.
Inform patients that the treated area may be sensitive to heat (e.g., hot showers/bath, direct sunlight, vigorous exercise) for a few days following treatment.

### Frostbite of the feet after cryotherapy: a report of two cases [^a0582dfd]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The use of cryotherapy for the reduction of postoperative swelling and pain has become commonplace in orthopedic, podiatric, and cosmetic surgery. Prolonged exposure to extreme cold may induce an injury nearly identical to that of frostbite. The authors report on 2 patients who underwent podiatric orthopedic surgery and were exposed to prolonged cold therapy, which resulted in limb-threatening problems. Both patients had prolonged and essentially uninterrupted application of cryotherapy for 4 to 7 days, resulting in rewarming injuries of tissue necrosis. A team of specialists used limb salvage therapy to successfully treat the patients. Because of the problems encountered with the cold therapy devices, the authors caution against unmonitored and prolonged cold exposure. Newer devices that prevent cold exposure below 65 degrees F for longer than 2 hours could be a better option in cases in which cryotherapy is used.

### Hypothermia and cold weather injuries [^5b625245]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypothermia, frostbite, and nonfreezing cold injuries predominantly affect older adults, homeless or intoxicated people, adventurers, and military personnel. Prevention begins with clothing that is clean, layered, and loose to promote circulation. Base layers made of moisture-wicking materials are favored over wool or cotton. Wool or fleece garments are ideal for middle layers, whereas outer layers should repel moisture. Hypothermia occurs when core body temperature drops below 95°F and can be staged by clinical symptoms when core temperature measurement is unavailable. Initial treatment includes external and internal rewarming. Warmed normal saline is favored over lactated Ringer solution. Frostbite is a freezing injury that usually affects the extremities. After rapid rewarming, prognosis is best determined with technetium 99mTc pyrophosphate scintigraphy or magnetic resonance angiography. Initial treatment includes protecting tissue from further trauma, preventing refreezing, and avoiding dry heat sources. Ideally, patients should be transported to facilities where rapid rewarming, imaging, and thrombolytic treatment are available. Tissue plasminogen activator significantly decreases amputation rates for severe injuries if started within 24 hours of rewarming. Immersion foot occurs during damp nonfreezing conditions. Rapid rewarming should be avoided, and amitriptyline should be considered for pain control.

Systemic antibiotics — Frostbite is not an inherently infection-prone injury and antibiotic administration specifically for preventing infection during or after frostbite injury is not supported by evidence; systemic antibiotics, either oral or parenteral, should be administered to patients with significant trauma, other potential infectious sources, or signs and symptoms of cellulitis or sepsis. Recommendation: Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

Key Points for Practice
- To prevent worsening tissue damage, a frostbitten extremity should be rewarmed only if there is no risk of refreezing.
- Rapid rewarming via water bath immersion and intravenous low-molecular-weight dextran leads to improved outcomes in frostbite.
- To limit tissue loss, oral ibuprofen should be started as soon as available and continued until surgery or complete healing.
- Tissue plasminogen activator improves outcomes for deep frostbite extending to proximal interphalangeal joints if given within 24 hours. From the AFP Editors. Thawing leads to ischemia, reperfusion injury, and an inflammatory response. In the vascular stasis phase, vessels fluctuate between dilation and constriction. The late ischemic phase involves progressive tissue ischemia and infarction from a cascade of events: inflammation, intermittent vasoconstriction, reperfusion injury, emboli in microvessels, and thrombus formation in larger vessels.

First-degree frostbite causes numbness, erythema, and often edema. White or yellow, slightly raised plaque develops over injured areas. Second-degree frostbite causes erythema, edema, and superficial skin blisters. Third-degree frostbite causes deeper hemorrhagic blisters, indicating that the injury has extended into the reticular dermis and beneath the dermal vascular plexus. Fourth-degree frostbite extends completely through the dermis and involves comparatively avascular subcutaneous tissues, with necrosis extending into muscle and bone. Frostnip is a superficial nonfreezing cold injury associated with intense vasoconstriction in exposed skin, usually the cheeks, ears, or nose. Ice crystals can form on skin surfaces, but not within the tissue. Numbness and pallor resolve quickly after warming, and no long-term damage occurs.

Avoiding alcohol, illicit drugs, or medications that reduce perfusion Avoiding cold weather exposure during illness Using chemical or electric hand and foot warmers Avoiding the use of skin emollients, which do not protect against frostbite and may actually increase risk Maintaining adequate hydration and nutrition Minimizing blood flow constriction caused by tight clothing or footwear. Minimizing duration of exposure to cold Frequently assessing for extremity numbness or pain and warming extremities as soon as possible if there is concern that frostbite is developing Recognizing frostnip or superficial frostbite before it becomes more serious If early frostbite is recognized, exercise can be protective by enhancing cold-induced peripheral vasodilation and elevating core and peripheral temperatures. However, if exercise leads to exhaustion, systemic heat loss can increase the risk of frostbite and hypothermia.

Field Treatment and Secondary Prevention If a body part is frozen in the field, it should be protected from further damage. Jewelry and other constrictive objects should be removed. If environmental conditions make it possible for thawed tissue to refreeze, it is safer to keep the area frozen until a thawed state can be maintained. Mild hypothermia can be treated concurrently with frostbite. Moderate to severe hypothermia should be treated before initiating frostbite treatment. The effect of hydration on frostbite outcomes has not been studied, but appropriate hydration is important for recovery. Oral fluids can be given to alert patients; otherwise, intravenous saline should be administered to maintain urine output. FIELD REWARMING Although outcomes are better with rapid rewarming, frostbite should be allowed to thaw spontaneously if rapid rewarming is not possible.
