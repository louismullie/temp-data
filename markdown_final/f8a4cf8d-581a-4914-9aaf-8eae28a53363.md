## Question

What is the recommended treatment for atrial flutter?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended treatment for atrial flutter. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about acute stabilization, especially distinguishing hemodynamic instability from stability. Then, I should verify rate versus rhythm control strategies for stable patients. Next, I will examine pharmacologic and electrical cardioversion specifics, including energy selection and anticoagulation. After that, I need to review catheter ablation as definitive therapy and its outcomes. Finally, I should consider long-term anticoagulation, AF surveillance, and special scenarios that modify management, anchoring all steps to contemporary ESC and ACC/AHA/HRS guidance.

> Let me first confirm the acute priorities. If the patient is hemodynamically unstable because of atrial flutter, immediate synchronized electrical cardioversion is indicated, and I should ensure energy delivery is synchronized to the QRS to avoid ventricular fibrillation; that's non-negotiable in an unstable scenario and aligns with both ESC SVT and ACC/AHA/HRS AF guidance [^114auYf5] [^114C7n2g] [^112DEh1K].

> Wait, I should double-check the initial energy selection because it's easy to conflate AF and AFL here. My first thought was to start at 200 J biphasic given AF recommendations, but hold on, that applies to AF elective cardioversion and in some difficult cases; for typical atrial flutter, lower energy shocks are usually effective, and ESC suggests 100 J biphasic for stable flutter cardioversion with escalation as needed, while ensuring synchronization at all times, so I'll correct my initial impulse accordingly and escalate if the first shock fails [^112BvycQ] [^1119CQSx] [^112DEh1K].

> For hemodynamically stable patients, let me consider rate control first. I should verify that intravenous beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers are appropriate to control the ventricular response in typical flutter, acknowledging these do not generally terminate the arrhythmia; ESC SVT guidance endorses IV beta-blockers or verapamil/diltiazem in stable macroreentrant atrial arrhythmias, with agent selection individualized to blood pressure, heart failure status, and comorbidities [^112zjBxN].

> Next, I should review pharmacologic rhythm control. I need to check which drugs are effective for flutter conversion; ESC guidance favors in-hospital ibutilide or dofetilide for pharmacologic cardioversion in stable macroreentrant flutter due to efficacy and the need to monitor for QT prolongation and torsades, and I should reserve other agents accordingly while observing telemetry and electrolytes [^112Mgcn2].

> I will now examine electrical cardioversion in stable patients when drugs are ineffective, contraindicated, or not preferred. Low-energy biphasic cardioversion, typically around 100 J with prompt escalation if needed, is effective for typical flutter, but I must not forget the pericardioversion anticoagulation protocols: in elective settings, therapeutic anticoagulation for roughly three weeks before and at least four weeks after restoration of sinus rhythm is standard, with immediate anticoagulation for urgent cardioversion when pre-treatment isn't feasible, per CCS and ACC/AHA/HRS guidance [^1119CQSx] [^113hzHQd] [^113pnCFP] [^117PnEu1] [^114srEj8].

> Hold on, definitive therapy deserves careful consideration. For symptomatic typical cavotricuspid isthmus–dependent flutter, catheter ablation is the preferred strategy because it is highly effective and durable; ESC 2020 supports ablation even after a first symptomatic episode and for persistent or recurrent flutter, and both CCS/CHRS and ACC/AHA/HRS recommend ablation as a reasonable or preferred alternative to drug therapy for clinically significant flutter [^115mdMmH] [^1113mPob] [^1146gVmh] [^1129jMTg] [^114mqL39].

> Let me verify expected outcomes to counsel patients accurately. Acute success achieving bidirectional isthmus block is typically in the high 80s to high 90s percent range, with lower fluoroscopy exposure when electroanatomic mapping is used and relatively low recurrence of typical flutter at six months; these data support the strong curative potential of CTI ablation and the procedural efficiency benefits of modern mapping [^111vYiKi] [^114zJPCx].

> But wait, I must emphasize a critical long-term issue: the development of atrial fibrillation after successful flutter ablation. I should confirm the magnitude; longer-term series show AF occurs in roughly 40–60% by 2–4 years, with risk factors including prior AF, older age, and left atrial enlargement, so surveillance and risk-factor management are essential and anticoagulation decisions may need to be revisited over time [^11588iUV] [^116LDMKp].

> Now, I need to ensure anticoagulation management is aligned with stroke risk rather than rhythm appearance. Atrial flutter carries a thromboembolic risk comparable to AF, estimated around 3% annually in untreated chronic flutter, so I should apply CHA₂DS₂-VASc–based thresholds similar to AF and continue anticoagulation for at least four weeks after cardioversion or ablation; in addition, in patients with successful CTI ablation but high risk for developing AF or prior documented AF, long-term anticoagulation remains indicated per ACC/AHA/HRS and ESC/EACTS guidance [^11651sUf] [^114jCWBp] [^115c2SSn] [^117PnEu1] [^114srEj8] [^1163kV9u].

> I should double-check risk thresholds. The ACC/AHA/HRS framework recommends oral anticoagulation when annual thromboembolic risk is at least 2% and consideration even at 1–2% based on CHA₂DS₂-VASc, which practically translates to most men with score ≥ 2 and women with score ≥ 3 definitely anticoagulated, with individualized discussion at intermediate scores; this same schema should be applied to atrial flutter, acknowledging evolving AF risk after CTI ablation [^113zvGVi] [^114sKXey] [^1163kV9u].

> Next, I should review special scenarios that modify management. Class IC–induced flutter with 1:1 conduction is a recognized complication of flecainide or propafenone; a hybrid strategy of CTI ablation while continuing class IC therapy has shown substantial AF recurrence at one year, so I need to caution about this pathway and consider alternatives based on patient-specific AF substrate and risks [^113n9PNH] [^111PjxQ8] [^1168nn1M].

> Let me consider comorbidity-tailored choices. In pulmonary hypertension, I should prioritize rhythm control to improve functional status and potentially outcomes, and in postoperative settings I should reassess rhythm at 30–60 days, proceeding to cardioversion after adequate anticoagulation if AF/AFL persists; these nuances ensure the plan fits the clinical context [^11176XKP] [^115u6DyL].

> I will now examine follow-up strategy. Given the high incidence of AF after flutter ablation, periodic ECG or ambulatory monitoring is prudent, with escalation from rate control to rhythm control or ablation if symptoms, tachycardiomyopathy, or inadequate rate control emerge; ablation improves quality of life, and reducing arrhythmia burden may lower rehospitalization over time, though real-world data show substantial long-term event rates underscoring the need for proactive strategies [^114zJPCx] [^1142BynS].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should summarize the practical algorithm clearly while keeping the anticoagulation guardrails front and center. Unstable flutter mandates synchronized cardioversion with appropriate energy and QRS synchronization, followed by guideline-directed anticoagulation; stable patients can start with rate control or proceed to rhythm control via ibutilide/dofetilide or synchronized low-energy biphasic cardioversion with pre- and post-procedure anticoagulation, and symptomatic typical flutter should be referred for CTI ablation early given its high success and curative potential; throughout, thromboembolic risk is managed as in AF and long-term AF surveillance is essential due to the strong inter-relationship between AF and AFL [^112DEh1K] [^112Mgcn2] [^1119CQSx] [^113hzHQd] [^117PnEu1] [^115mdMmH] [^1164cLun] [^1168G4XK].

Treat atrial flutter by first stabilizing the patient and controlling the ventricular rate with **beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers** in hemodynamically stable patients [^112zjBxN]. For rhythm control, use **electrical cardioversion** (100 J biphasic) if unstable or if rapid restoration of sinus rhythm is needed [^114auYf5] [^1119CQSx]. Catheter ablation is the **preferred definitive therapy** for typical flutter, with high success and low recurrence [^1113mPob] [^1146gVmh]. Anticoagulation is required based on stroke risk and for at least 4 weeks after cardioversion or ablation [^114srEj8] [^114jCWBp]. Monitor for AF recurrence and adjust therapy accordingly.

---

## Initial assessment and stabilization

During initial assessment, assess **hemodynamic stability** — look for hypotension, ischemia, or pulmonary edema — and perform immediate synchronized cardioversion if instability is present [^114auYf5] [^1112YgEg]. In **stable patients**, initiate rate control and evaluate rhythm control and anticoagulation.

---

## Rate control

Rate control is essential to relieve symptoms and prevent **tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy**.

- **First-line agents**: Beta-blockers (e.g. metoprolol) or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem) [^112zjBxN].

- **Alternative agents**: Amiodarone or digoxin may be considered if first-line agents are contraindicated or ineffective.

- **Target heart rate**: Aim for < 100 bpm at rest.

---

## Rhythm control

Rhythm control aims to restore **sinus rhythm** and relieve symptoms.

- **Electrical cardioversion**: Highly effective; recommended for hemodynamically unstable patients or when rapid restoration is needed [^114auYf5] [^1119CQSx].

- **Pharmacological cardioversion**: Ibutilide or dofetilide are effective options for stable patients [^112Mgcn2].

- **Catheter ablation**: Preferred definitive therapy for typical atrial flutter, with high success and low recurrence [^1113mPob] [^1146gVmh].

---

## Anticoagulation

Anticoagulation is critical to prevent **thromboembolic complications**.

- **Pre-cardioversion**: Anticoagulate for at least 3 weeks before cardioversion if flutter duration > 48 hours or unknown [^113hzHQd].

- **Post-cardioversion**: Continue anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks after successful cardioversion or ablation [^114srEj8].

- **Long-term anticoagulation**: Based on stroke risk assessment (CHA₂DS₂-VASc), similar to atrial fibrillation [^114jCWBp].

---

## Long-term management and follow-up

Long-term management and follow-up emphasize **regular visits and ECG monitoring** to detect recurrence or progression to atrial fibrillation. Ongoing care includes risk-factor modification (e.g. hypertension, obesity, sleep apnea) and patient education on symptom recognition, medication adherence, and when to seek medical attention.

### Global burden of atrial fibrillation and flutter by national income: Results from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 database [^111semsR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

The absolute global prevalence of atrial fibrillation and flutter (AF/AFL) has more than doubled between 1990 and 2019, from worldwide estimates of 28,273,978 AF/AFL cases in 1990 to 59,671,814 cases in 2019. In middle-income countries, the rise in prevalence has been greatest, with an increase of 146.6% in lower-middle-income countries and an increase of 145.2% in upper-middle-income countries. In low-income countries, the prevalence rose by 120.7%. In high-income countries, AF/AFL prevalence has risen by 67.8%. High-income countries had the highest absolute prevalence until 2014. Since then, prevalence in upper-middle-income countries has been higher than in high-income countries.

The relative prevalence of AF/AFL is still highest in high-income countries, with a prevalence rate of 1738 per 100,000 in 2019. In upper-middle-income countries, relative prevalence was 844 per 100,000, in lower-middle-income countries 487 per 100,000, and in low-income countries 144 per 100,000. The absolute number of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) has continuously increased since 1990. This increase was greatest in upper-middle-income countries, with the number of DALYs attributable to AF/AFL in upper-middle-income countries (+150.4%) almost reaching the numbers of high-income countries (+80.0%) in 2019. In lower-middle-income countries, the number of DALYs has increased by 166.2% since 1990, and by 129.4% in low-income countries.

In contrast to prevalence, the absolute number of AF/AFL-related deaths continues to be highest in high-income countries. It increased by 131%.

### Missed opportunities for appropriate anticoagulation among emergency department patients with uncomplicated atrial fibrillation or flutter [^113hMCT3]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The study objective was to investigate whether emergency physicians appropriately provided anticoagulation for patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter at risk of stroke, according to guidelines recommending anticoagulation for increased cardiovascular risk.

This retrospective cohort study utilized a database from two urban emergency departments to identify consecutive patients with an emergency department discharge diagnosis of atrial fibrillation or flutter from April 1, 2006, to March 31, 2010. These patients were managed solely by an emergency physician. Comorbidities, rhythms, and management were obtained by chart review, and complex patients — those with an acute underlying medical condition — were excluded based on predefined criteria. Patient medications at emergency department presentations were acquired through the provincial Pharmanet database. The patients were stratified into CHADS₂ scores (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age > 75, diabetes, stroke/transient ischemic attack).

- **Primary outcome**: The proportion of higher-risk patients (CHADS₂ score > 0) who were discharged home without correct anticoagulation by the emergency physician.
- **Secondary outcome**: The number of lower-risk patients (CHADS₂ = 0) who commenced warfarin by emergency physician orders.

The regional emergency department database was examined to identify the number of patients who experienced a stroke within 30 days.

Results showed that 1,090 consecutive patients were enrolled, with 732 discharged home without cardiology consultation.

### Effect of electroanatomically guided versus conventional catheter ablation of typical atrial flutter on the fluoroscopy time and resource use: A prospective randomized multicenter study [^111vYiKi]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2009). High credibility.

Radiofrequency catheter ablation of typical atrial flutter is one of the most frequent indications for catheter ablation in electrophysiology laboratories today. The clinical utility of electroanatomic mapping systems on treatment results and resource utilization, compared with conventional ablation, has not been systematically investigated in a prospective multicenter study.

- **Methods and results**: In this prospective, randomized multicenter study, the results of catheter ablation to cure typical atrial flutter using a conventional ablation strategy were compared with electroanatomically guided mapping and ablation (Carto). The primary endpoints of the study were procedure duration and fluoroscopy exposure time, while the secondary endpoints were acute success rate, recurrence rate, and resource utilization. A total of 210 patients (169 men, 41 women, mean age 63 ± 10 years) with documented typical atrial flutter were included in the study. Acute ablation success, defined as the demonstration of bidirectional isthmus block, was achieved in 99 of 105 patients (94%) in the electroanatomically guided ablation group and in 102 of 105 patients (97%) in the conventional ablation group (P > 0.05). Total procedure duration was comparable between both study groups (99 ± 57 minutes vs. 88 ± 54 minutes, P > 0.05). However, fluoroscopy exposure time was significantly shorter in the electroanatomically guided ablation group (7.7 ± 7.3 minutes vs. 14.8 ± 11.9 minutes; P < 0.05). The total recurrence rate of typical atrial flutter at six months of follow-up was comparable between the two groups.

### Atrial flutter: More than just one of a kind [^1173km1Z]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Since its first description about one century ago, our understanding of atrial flutter (AFL) circuits has considerably evolved. One AFL circuit can have variable electrocardiographic (ECG) manifestations depending on the presence of pre-existing atrial lesions or impaired atrial substrate. Conversely, different (right-sided or even left-sided) atrial circuits, including different mechanisms (macroreentrant, microreentrant, or focal), can present with a very similar surface ECG manifestation.

The development of efficient high-resolution electroanatomical mapping systems has improved our knowledge about AFL mechanisms and facilitated their curative treatment with radiofrequency catheter ablation. This article will review ECG features for typical and atypical flutters and emphasize the limitations for circuit location from the surface ECG.

### Atrial fibrillation is common after ablation of isolated atrial flutter during long-term follow-up [^11588iUV]. Heart Rhythm (2007). Low credibility.

Previous studies have shown that the incidence of atrial fibrillation after atrial flutter ablation is approximately 20% among patients presenting with typical atrial flutter and no history of fibrillation. However, studies involving this population have been small, with follow-up typically less than 2 years.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to provide a more accurate perspective on the long-term risk of atrial fibrillation in patients presenting with isolated typical flutter.

- **Methods**: Clinical records of consecutive patients who had flutter ablations at Presbyterian Medical Center between 1999 and 2004 were assessed (n = 254). Patients with no apparent history of atrial fibrillation before their flutter ablation were identified. Retrospective follow-up data on these patients were obtained by reviewing medical records from our institution, from patients' cardiologists and primary care physicians, and by direct patient questionnaires. Postablation atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias were identified by electrocardiography, Holter monitoring, and subsequent clinical records.

- **Results**: Postablation atrial fibrillation was identified in 40 (50%) of 80 patients, and an additional three patients presented with atypical atrial flutter following a mean follow-up of 29.6 ± 21.7 months. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was progressive, with 49% occurring after 2 years. There was no difference in age, left atrial size, hypertension, structural heart disease, or left ventricular dysfunction in patients who developed atrial fibrillation compared with those.

### Recurrence rate of atrial flutter after initial presentation in patients on drug treatment [^1149tnLj]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Atrial flutter (AFl) recurrence after initial in-patient presentation, cardioversion, and drug treatment is almost universal, often leading to rehospitalization and risk of serious clinical consequences. Radiofrequency ablation of AFl, which has an excellent safety record, should be evaluated as a first-line approach for most patients with AFl.

### Pharmacological cardioversion for atrial fibrillation and flutter [^112EyzHx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac dysrhythmia and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. There are two approaches to its management: controlling the ventricular rate or converting to sinus rhythm with the expectation of abolishing its adverse effects.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of pharmacological cardioversion of atrial fibrillation in adults on the annual risk of stroke, peripheral embolism, and mortality.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 3, 2002), MEDLINE (2000 to 2002), EMBASE (1998 to 2002), CINAHL (1982 to 2002), and Web of Science (1981 to 2002). We hand-searched the following journals: Circulation (1997 to 2002), Heart (1997 to 2002), European Heart Journal (1997–2002), and Journal of the American College of Cardiology (1997–2002). Additionally, selected abstracts published on the website of the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology (2001, 2002) were reviewed.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials or controlled clinical trials comparing pharmacological cardioversion versus rate control in adults over 18 years old with acute, paroxysmal, or sustained atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, of any duration and any etiology.

- **Data collection and analysis**: One reviewer applied the inclusion criteria and extracted the data. Trial quality was assessed, and the data were entered into RevMan.

- **Main results**: We identified two completed studies: AFFIRM (n = 4060) and PIAF (n = 252). We found no difference in mortality between rhythm control and rate control with a relative risk of 1.14.

### Emergency department management and 1-year outcomes of patients with atrial flutter [^112uW2at]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Atrial flutter is a common arrhythmia seen in the emergency department (ED), yet there is little research describing its management and outcomes. This study analyzes the success and safety of the treatment of ED patients with atrial flutter.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective cohort study obtained by searching the ED administrative database of two urban hospitals to identify consecutive patients with a primary discharge diagnosis of atrial flutter from April 1, 2006, to January 31, 2009. We linked each patient's unique provincial health number to the provincial vital statistics registry and the regional ED database to identify subsequent deaths and strokes within one year. Manual chart review was conducted to confirm rhythms and outcomes and to identify patient comorbidities. Patients were stratified into five groups based on initial ED presentation and management approach: electrocardioversion, chemical cardioversion, spontaneous cardioversion, rate control only, and no acute ED arrhythmia-specific treatment. The primary outcome was the combined one-year rate of stroke or death, and secondary outcomes included the proportion of eligible patients with conversion to normal sinus rhythm in each group and discharged to home.

- **Results**: Data from 122 consecutive patients with a primary ED diagnosis of atrial flutter were collected. There were three deaths and no strokes (2.5%; 95% confidence interval 0% to 5.1%) in the following year. Patients undergoing electrocardioversion achieved normal sinus rhythm 91% of the time, with 93% discharged home; patients undergoing oral or intravenous antiarrhythmic therapy also had successful outcomes.

### Tachycardia due to atrial flutter with rapid 1:1 conduction following treatment of atrial fibrillation with flecainide [^113n9PNH]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

Flecainide can "organise" atrial fibrillation into atrial flutter with 1:1 conduction, leading to cardiovascular compromise. The treatment of atrial fibrillation in the emergency department is often complex and depends on several factors, including the time of onset of atrial fibrillation and previously known cardiac disease. Guidelines include flecainide as a possible treatment for chemical cardioversion and maintaining sinus rhythm in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. An important, under-recognized complication of flecainide is the transformation of rhythm from atrial fibrillation to atrial flutter. We present four such cases.

### Are atrial fibrillation patients receiving warfarin in accordance with stroke risk [^113ZE8Wy]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Clinical guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter provide recommendations for anticoagulation based on patients' overall risk of stroke. To determine real-world compliance of physicians with these recommendations, we conducted a retrospective cohort study examining the utilization of warfarin in atrial fibrillation/flutter patients by stroke risk level.

- **Methods**: Patients with a qualifying atrial fibrillation/flutter diagnosis during ≥ 18 months' continuous enrollment between January 2003 and September 2007, and with ≥ 6 months' eligibility after the first atrial fibrillation/flutter diagnosis, were identified from the US MarketScan database (Thomson Reuters, New York, NY). Warfarin use within 30 days of the first diagnosis was assessed according to stroke risk, estimated using the Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age > 75 years, Diabetes, Stroke (CHADS₂) score.

- **Results**: Of 171,393 patients included in the analysis, 20.0% had a CHADS₂ score of 0 (low risk), 61.6% a score of 1–2 (moderate risk), and 18.4% a score of 3–6 (high risk). Warfarin, recommended for high stroke-risk patients, was given to only 42.1% of those with a CHADS₂ score of 3–6. A similar percentage of patients with moderate (43.5%) or low stroke risk (40.1%) received warfarin. Only 29.6% of high-risk, 33.3% of moderate-risk, and 34.1% of low-risk patients who were started on warfarin received uninterrupted therapy for 6 months following their initial prescription.

- **Conclusions**: These data suggest that guideline recommendations for anticoagulation are not being met effectively in practice, with only a fraction of patients receiving the recommended continuation of warfarin therapy consistent with their stroke risk level.

### Electrical cardioversion for atrial fibrillation and flutter [^116wRKRT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation increases stroke risk and adversely affects cardiovascular hemodynamics. Electrical cardioversion may, by restoring sinus rhythm, improve cardiovascular hemodynamics, reduce the risk of stroke, and eliminate the need for long-term anticoagulation.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation or flutter on the risk of thromboembolic events, strokes, and mortality (primary outcomes), as well as the rate of cognitive decline, quality of life, use of anticoagulants, and risk of re-hospitalization (secondary outcomes) in adults over 18 years of age.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials (1967 to May 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2004), Embase (1980 to May 2004), CINAHL (1982 to May 2004), and proceedings of the American College of Cardiology (published in Journal of the American College of Cardiology, 1983 to 2003). Searches were also conducted on www.trialscentral.org, www.controlled-trials.com, and reference lists of articles. We hand-searched the indexes of the Proceedings of the British Cardiac Society published in British Heart Journal (1980 to 1995) and in Heart (1995 to 2002); proceedings of the European Congress of Cardiology and meetings of the Joint Working Groups of the European Society of Cardiology (published in European Heart Journal 1983–2003); and scientific sessions of the American Heart Association (published in Circulation 1990–2003).

### Long-term efficacy of cryo catheter ablation for the treatment of atrial flutter: Results from a repeat electrophysiologic study [^113AjuMy]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

We investigated the long-term efficacy of cryo ablation for the treatment of atrial flutter. To our knowledge, no study has assessed the long-term efficacy of cryo ablation by evaluating both symptom and conduction recurrence.

A total of 45 consecutive patients with symptomatic atrial flutter were ablated using a 7-F, 6-mm-tip, quadripolar cryo catheter (Freezor Xtra, CryoCath Technologies Inc, Kirkland, Canada). Electrophysiologic studies (EPS) were conducted with diagnostic catheters. Cryo ablation was performed at -75 degrees Celsius for 4 minutes, starting at the inferior rim of the coronary sinus os and creating a posterior line to the Eustachian ridge. We assessed safety, bi-directional isthmus block at intervention, and recurrence at three, six, and nine months post-procedure.

There were no adverse events reported. All patients were free of discomfort during cryo energy delivery. The acute success rate at intervention was 87%. Follow-up data from 39 acutely successful patients showed that 27 (69%) had no conduction recurrence on repeat EPS at three months, and none (0%) had symptom recurrence documented by Holter monitoring, electrocardiogram, and/or patient diary records at three, six, and nine months follow-up.

Our experience with a new 7-F, 6-mm-tip, quadripolar cryo catheter yielded a fairly high success rate at intervention, an excellent safety profile, and a good chronic success rate in terms of symptom recurrence. However, further monitoring is necessary to determine whether all asymptomatic patients continue to remain free of symptoms.

### Long term follow up of radiofrequency catheter ablation of atrial flutter: Clinical course and predictors of atrial fibrillation occurrence [^116LDMKp]. Heart (2004). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the time to onset and the predictors of atrial fibrillation (AF) during long-term follow-up of patients with typical atrial flutter (AFL) treated with transisthmic ablation.

The design was a prospective multicentre study.

Methods and results: 383 patients (75.4% men, mean (SD) age 61.7 (11.1) years) who underwent transisthmic ablation for typical AFL were investigated. In 239 patients (62.4%), AF was present before ablation. Ablation proved successful in 367 patients (95.8%). During a mean (SD) follow-up of 20.5 (12.4) months, 41.5% of patients reported AF. The cumulative probability of postablation AF increased continuously as time passed: it was 22% at six months, 36% at one year, 50% at two years, 58% at three years, and 63% at four years.

In conclusion, AF occurred in a large proportion of patients after transisthmic catheter ablation of typical AFL. The occurrence of AF was progressive during follow-up. Preablation AF, age over 50 years, and left atrial diameter greater than 50 mm are associated with postablation AF occurrence.

### Long-term outcomes after hospitalization for atrial fibrillation or flutter [^1142BynS]. European Heart Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Patients hospitalized for atrial fibrillation (AF) and flutter had a low survival rate of 55.2% at 10 years, with an attributable loss of life expectancy of 2.6 years, or nearly one-fifth of their anticipated life expectancy. AF-associated cardiovascular outcomes were relatively common, as was re-hospitalization for AF or flutter, which occurred in two out of every five patients by 10 years. Despite the high burden of AF or flutter re-hospitalizations, the incidence of AF ablation was low, with fewer than 7% of patients receiving this procedure at 10 years post-discharge. Effective strategies are needed to reduce the AF burden and decrease the downstream risk of AF and flutter-related adverse cardiovascular events.

### Rhythm- and rate-controlling effects of dronedarone in patients with atrial fibrillation (from the ATHENA trial) [^117PBuQV]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Dronedarone is a multi-channel-blocking drug used for treating patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter (AFL), exhibiting both rate- and rhythm-controlling properties. The ATHENA trial, a placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel arm study, assessed the efficacy of dronedarone 400 mg b.i.d. in preventing cardiovascular hospitalization or death from any cause in patients with AF or AFL. The trial demonstrated that dronedarone reduces the risk of first cardiovascular hospitalization or death from any cause.

The aim of this post hoc analysis was to evaluate the rhythm- and rate-controlling properties of dronedarone within the ATHENA trial. Patients were randomized to receive either dronedarone 400 mg twice daily (n = 2,301) or placebo (n = 2,327). Electrocardiographic tracings were classified for AF, AFL, or sinus rhythm, with those presenting AF or AFL on every post-baseline electrocardiogram classified as having permanent AF or AFL. All electrical cardioversions were documented, and the distribution of rate-controlling medications was equal across the two treatment groups.

The median time to first AF or AFL recurrence for patients in sinus rhythm at baseline was notably longer for those in the dronedarone group (737 days) compared to the placebo group (498 days; hazard ratio 0.749, 95% confidence interval 0.681 to 0.824, p < 0.001). In the dronedarone group, 339 patients (15%) underwent at least one electrical cardioversion, as opposed to 481 patients (21%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0.684, 95% confidence interval 0.596 to 0.786, p < 0.001). The likelihood of developing permanent AF or AFL was lower in the dronedarone group, with only 178 patients (7.6%) affected.

### The clinical outcomes of patients who developed typical atrial flutter on class 1C antiarrhythmic medications treated with hybrid approach [^111PjxQ8]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

A common approach to patients who develop atrial flutter secondary to treatment with class 1C antiarrhythmic drugs for atrial fibrillation (AF), known as 1C flutter, is a hybrid approach: ablation of the Cavo‐Tricuspid isthmus (CTI) and continuation of 1C medical treatment to prevent recurrence of AF. We aim to explore the clinical outcomes of patients treated with this approach.

- **Methods and results**: Two hundred and four consecutive patients who underwent ablation for typical atrial flutter (AFL) at a tertiary medical center between 2010 and 2016 were enrolled and followed up. The clinical outcomes of patients treated with the hybrid approach (treatment group; n = 67) were compared to those of patients without a history of AF (control group; n = 137). The primary endpoint was time to the occurrence of AF. Twenty-eight (41.8%) patients in the treatment group experienced AF occurrence in 1 year, including 9 (13.4%) patients who needed to escalate antiarrhythmic drug treatment to class III, and 11 (16.4%) patients who underwent AF ablation. In comparison, only 21 (15.3%) patients in the control group experienced occurrence during the first year after ablation. The median time from ablation to AF occurrence was 106 ± 481 days in the treatment group, and 403 ± 668 days in the control group (P < .01).

- **Conclusions**: There is a relatively high rate of AF recurrence in patients treated with the hybrid approach during the first year after CTI ablation. An alternative approach should be considered in this selected population.

Regarding perioperative care for atrial flutter, specifically with respect to pericardioversion anticoagulation, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of long-term anticoagulation after successful cavotricuspid isthmus ablation. This recommendation applies to patients with typical atrial flutter who do not have a known previous history of atrial fibrillation (AF) but are at high risk for developing AF. Such risk factors include left atrium enlargement, inducible AF, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and heart failure (HF). Anticoagulation should be initiated if a thromboembolic risk assessment suggests a high risk (greater than 2% annual risk) for stroke.

### Inter-relationships of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter mechanisms and clinical implications [^1164cLun]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

There is a close interrelationship between atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL). Atrial fibrillation of variable duration precedes the onset of AFL in almost all instances; during AF, the functional components needed to complete the AFL re-entrant circuit, principally a line of block (LoB) between the vena cavae, are formed. If this LoB does not form, classical AFL does not develop. In contrast, there seems to be a spectrum of atrial re-entrant circuits (drivers) of short cycle lengths (CLs), known as AFL. When the CL of the AFL re-entrant circuit is so short that it will only activate portions of the atria in a 1:1 manner, the rest of the atria will be activated rapidly but irregularly, via fibrillatory conduction, resulting in AF. In summary, there are probably several mechanisms of AF, one of which is due to a very rapid AFL causing fibrillatory conduction. All of these interactions of AF and AFL have important clinical implications.

### Atypical atrial flutter: Electrophysiological characterization and effective catheter ablation [^115HmM5j]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). High credibility.

Atrial flutter (AFL), defined as macro-re-entrant atrial tachycardia, is associated with debilitating symptoms, stroke, heart failure, and increased mortality. AFL is classified into typical, or cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI)-dependent, and atypical, or non-CTI-dependent. Atypical AFL is a heterogeneous group of re-entrant atrial tachycardias that most commonly occur in patients with prior heart surgery or catheter ablation. Although the ECG pattern is poorly predictive of circuit anatomy, it may still provide mechanistic insight.

AFL is difficult to manage medically, and catheter ablation is the preferred treatment for most patients. Recent progress in technology and clinical electrophysiology has led to a detailed characterization of re-entry circuits and effective ablation strategies. Combined activation and entrainment mapping are key to identifying the re-entry circuit. The presence of a slow-conducting isthmus, localized re-entry, dual-loop re-entry, or bystander loops may lead to misleading activation maps, but these can be identified by electrogram examination and entrainment mapping.

In the occasional patient without inducible AFL, substrate mapping in sinus rhythm may be a viable strategy. Long-term ablation success requires the creation of a transmural continuous lesion across a critical component of the re-entry circuit. Procedural endpoints include bidirectional conduction block across linear lesions and non-inducibility of atrial tachycardia.

The present review discusses the epidemiology, mechanisms, ECG characteristics, electrophysiological characterization, and catheter ablation of AFL.

### Controversies in atrial fibrillation [^116fK9eo]. Lancet (2006). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation, the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, significantly contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Many aspects of managing atrial fibrillation remain controversial. Nine specific controversies in atrial fibrillation management are addressed, focusing briefly on the following:

- **Relations between mechanisms and therapy**: Examining the interconnectedness between the underlying mechanisms of atrial fibrillation and therapeutic strategies.
- **Roles of rhythm and rate control**: Challenges in determining the most effective approach for managing heart rhythm and rate.
- **Definition of optimum rate control**: Establishing the criteria for effective rate control.
- **Need for early cardioversion to prevent remodeling**: Evaluating whether early intervention through cardioversion can prevent cardiac remodeling.
- **Comparison of electrical with pharmacological cardioversion**: Assessing the effectiveness of electrical versus pharmacological methods of cardioversion.
- **Selection of patients for long-term oral anticoagulation**: Identifying which patients would benefit most from long-term oral anticoagulation therapy.
- **Roles of novel long-term anticoagulation approaches and ablation therapy**: Exploring new anticoagulation methods and the effectiveness of ablation therapy.
- **Potential usefulness of upstream therapy targeting substrate development**: Investigating therapies aimed at addressing the development of substrates underlying atrial fibrillation.

The background of each controversy is reviewed, and our opinions are expressed. We aim to inform physicians about the critical controversies in this specialty and encourage investigators to address these unresolved issues.

### Vascepa [^115xPaXu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Atrial fibrillation/flutter**: Vascepa is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8,179 statin-treated subjects with established cardiovascular disease (CVD) or diabetes plus an additional risk factor for CVD, adjudicated atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization for 24 or more hours occurred in 127 (3%) patients treated with Vascepa compared to 84 (2%) patients receiving placebo [HR = 1.5 (95% CI 1.14, 1.98)]. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.

- **Potential for allergic reactions in patients with fish allergy**: Vascepa contains ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish. It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and/or shellfish are at increased risk of an allergic reaction to Vascepa. Inform patients with known hypersensitivity to fish and/or shellfish about the potential for allergic reactions to Vascepa and advise them to discontinue Vascepa and seek medical attention if any reactions occur.

- **Bleeding**: Vascepa is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcomes trial of 8,179 patients, 482 (12%) patients receiving Vascepa experienced a bleeding event compared to 404 (10%) patients receiving placebo. Serious bleeding events occurred in 111 (3%) of patients on Vascepa versus 85 (2%) of patients receiving placebo.

### Emergency department patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter and an acute underlying medical illness may not benefit from attempts to control rate or rhythm [^115tSbMQ]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Although the management and outcomes of emergency department (ED) patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter have been explored, such studies have typically excluded patients with acute underlying medical illnesses. This study seeks to describe the ED treatment and outcomes of these complex patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter.

This retrospective descriptive cohort study used an ECG database from two urban EDs to identify consecutive ED patients with an ECG demonstrating atrial fibrillation or flutter from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2009. Patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter were categorized as "complex" according to prespecified criteria and then grouped as being managed with rate or rhythm control attempts, or not. The primary outcome was the safety of rate or rhythm control, measured by whether patients had a predefined adverse event. The secondary outcome was the success of rate or rhythm control, defined as rate control decreasing the pulse rate by 20 beats/min and successful rhythm control, both within 4 hours of treatment initiation. Descriptive statistics were used to compare the two groups.

Four hundred sixteen complex patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter were identified. Patients managed with rate or rhythm control were similar in all baseline characteristics and illness distribution to patients who were not managed in this manner. The 135 patients with attempted rate control (105) or rhythm control (30) had 55 adverse events (40.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 32.5% to 49.5%), whereas the 281 patients…

### Results of catheter ablation of typical atrial flutter [^114zJPCx]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency (RF) ablation of typical atrial flutter using an 8-mm electrode catheter and a 100-W RF power generator. A limitation of previous trials of catheter ablation of atrial flutter is that the data were not collected as part of a prospective multicenter clinical trial. The study results associated catheter ablation of typical atrial flutter in a cohort of 150 patients with an 88% acute efficacy rate. At the 6-month follow-up, typical atrial flutter was observed in 13% of patients. Of the 12 patients with typical atrial flutter recurrence, 4 were symptomatic and 8 were asymptomatic. Procedure duration was a significant predictor of typical atrial flutter recurrence. The 12-month rate for the development of atrial fibrillation was 30%.

Catheter ablation of atrial flutter was associated with significant improvements in 5 of 8 domains of the Short Form 36 Survey (quality of life) and significant decreases in 13 of the 16 symptoms of the Symptom Checklist. The device- or procedure-related complication rate was 2.7%. Skin burns occurred at the dispersive pad site due to stronger RF power in 3 patients. The use of a dual dispersive pad system mitigated this problem. Thus, the results of this study associated catheter ablation of atrial flutter with high acute efficacy, a small risk of recurrent atrial flutter, and an important risk of atrial fibrillation during follow-up.

### Relapse and mortality following cardioversion of new-onset vs. recurrent atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter in the elderly [^115SXQEX]. European Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

- **Aims**: Trials of rate control vs. rhythm control for atrial fibrillation or flutter included few patients with new-onset arrhythmia. Our objective was to assess the relapse rate and the effect of the relapse of new-onset atrial arrhythmias on mortality after direct-current cardioversion (DCCV).

- **Methods and results**: A cohort of 351 patients with atrial fibrillation (new onset in 179) and 126 patients with atrial flutter (new onset in 78) was followed up after DCCV. Cox proportional hazard models were used. The median age was 74.6 years. Mean follow-up for relapse was 7.7 months; for death, 29.4 months. Patients with new-onset atrial flutter [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 1] were more likely to maintain sinus rhythm than the patients with recurrent atrial flutter (adjusted HR = 2.5, P < 0.01), new-onset atrial fibrillation (adjusted HR = 2.4, P < 0.01), or recurrent atrial fibrillation (adjusted HR = 2.7, P < 0.01). Patients with new-onset atrial fibrillation were as likely to have relapses as patients with recurrent atrial fibrillation or flutter. Relapse of atrial arrhythmia after DCCV was associated with increased mortality (adjusted HR = 3.1, P < 0.01).

- **Conclusion**: DCCV is more successful in maintaining sinus rhythm in patients with new-onset atrial flutter than in patients with new-onset atrial fibrillation. Relapse of atrial arrhythmia after cardioversion is associated with increased mortality.

### Randomized comparison of multipolar, duty-cycled, bipolar-unipolar radiofrequency versus conventional catheter ablation for treatment of common atrial flutter [^113kHSHC]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2010). Low credibility.

Radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation has been established as an effective and curative treatment for atrial flutter (AFL). Approved methods include a drag-and-drop method, as well as a point-by-point ablation technique. The aim of this study was to compare the acute efficacy and procedural efficiency of a multipolar linear ablation catheter with simultaneous energy delivery to multiple catheter electrodes against conventional RF for the treatment of AFL.

- **Methods**: Patients presenting to our department with symptomatic, typical AFL were enrolled consecutively and randomized to conventional RF ablation with an 8-mm tip catheter (ConvRF) or a duty-cycled, bipolar-unipolar RF generator delivering power to a hexapolar tip-versatile ablation catheter (T-VAC) group. For both groups, the procedural endpoint was bidirectional cavotricuspid isthmus block.

- **Results**: Sixty patients were enrolled, with 30 patients each assigned to ConvRF and T-VAC groups. Total procedure time (40.2 ± 15.8 min vs. 60.5 ± 12.7 min), energy delivery time (8.5 ± 3.7 min vs. 14.7 ± 5.2 min), radiation dose (14.5 ± 3.5 cGy/cm² vs. 31.7 ± 12.1 cGy/cm²), and the minimum number of RF applications needed to achieve block (4.2 ± 2.4 vs. 8.9 ± 7.2) were significantly lower in the T-VAC group. In 7 patients treated with the T-VAC catheter, bidirectional block was achieved with less than 3 RF applications, versus no patients with conventional RF energy delivery.

- **Conclusion**: The treatment of typical AFL using a hexapolar catheter with a multipolar, duty-cycled, bipolar-unipolar RF generator offers comparable efficacy.

### Late recurrent arrhythmias after ablation of atrial fibrillation: Incidence, mechanisms, and treatment [^117BLuiF]. Heart Rhythm (2004). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to determine the incidence of atrial flutter and other arrhythmia recurrences (other than atrial fibrillation [AF]) during long-term follow-up after left atrial substrate modification by percutaneous radiofrequency (RF) ablation of AF.

RF ablation is an effective treatment for patients with AF. However, late recurrences of arrhythmias may complicate the patient's course.

One hundred fifty consecutive patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF were included in this prospective study. The incidence of arrhythmia recurrences after AF ablation was analyzed during long-term follow-up using repetitive 7-day ECG recording.

In 28 of 150 patients (18.7%), stable regular arrhythmias other than AF were detected during follow-up. Left atrial flutter, observed in 10 patients (6.7%), was treated by recompletion of the ablation lines in all 10 patients. Left atrial flutter was associated with recurrence of AF in all 10 patients. Nine of the 10 patients (90%) were free from atrial flutter, and 6 of the 10 patients were free from AF after the second intervention. Typical right atrial flutter occurred in 10 patients (6.7%) and was treated successfully by percutaneous RF ablation without recurrence in all patients. Additionally, atrial flutter was documented during follow-up in 7 patients (4.7%); however, invasive electrophysiologic evaluation was not performed due to various reasons.

Left atrial flutter is a relevant complication after RF catheter ablation of AF and was always associated with AF recurrence in our study population.

### Atrial flutter and the risk of thromboembolism: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^11651sUf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies to assess the risk of thromboembolism associated with atrial flutter.

- **Methods**: MEDLINE, EMBASE, bibliographies, and consultation with clinical experts were used to identify studies that report the risk of thromboembolism associated with attempted cardioversion and longer-term risk in chronic atrial flutter. The review process and data extraction were performed by two reviewers. Study event rates were assessed graphically, and a chi-squared test was used to assess heterogeneity across studies. Meta-regression with weighted logistic regression was used to assess the association between study-level clinical factors and reported thromboembolic event rates.

- **Results**: We found 13 studies that reported the risk of thromboembolism associated with cardioversion of atrial flutter. Short-term event rates ranged from 0% to 7.3%. A chi-squared test for heterogeneity was significant (P < 0.001), so results were not pooled. Instead, a meta-regression analysis was performed, which partly explained the heterogeneity across studies. Studies were more likely to report high event rates when they included patients with a prior history of thromboembolism and to report lower event rates when at least some patients were anticoagulated or if patients underwent echocardiography before cardioversion. Four studies reported the longer-term risk of thromboembolism, suggesting a yearly event rate of approximately 3% with sustained atrial flutter.

- **Conclusion**: These findings suggest that atrial flutter is indeed associated with a significant risk of thromboembolism.

### 2017 HRS/EHRA/ECAS/APHRS/SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^111fvNsF]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Low credibility.

Macroreentry is a broad term that encompasses what have been considered typical and atypical atrial flutters (AFLs). The hallmark of macroreentry is that two sites ≥ 2 cm apart demonstrate entrainment with a post-pacing interval–tachycardia cycle length of ≤ 20 ms (i.e. within the circuit).

The most common forms of atrial macroreentry are variants of classical common and reverse common cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent flutter. These include both counterclockwise (common) and clockwise (reverse common) variants, with the circuit originally described as a broad active wavefront rotating around the tricuspid annulus. However, it is now recognized that many variants exist, such as lower loop reentry and forms in which the active wavefront crosses immediately anterior or posterior to the inferior vena cava. Rarely, intraisthmus reentry can occur.

Classical AFL almost invariably coexists with AF. Studies of AFL onset and termination have demonstrated that both invariably require transitional AF, indicating that flutter is largely a downstream arrhythmia. Attempts to modify the natural history of AF by ablation of AFL have thus far largely been unsuccessful. Nevertheless, cavotricuspid isthmus ablation is a simple procedure with high efficacy and low risk that can provide good arrhythmia palliation in the appropriately selected patient. However, long-term follow-up studies following flutter ablation have demonstrated increasing prevalence of AF during long-term follow-up.

### The natural history of lone atrial flutter [^116Yj3vD]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The natural history of atrial flutter is not well defined. The objective of this study was to report the risk for stroke, conversion to atrial fibrillation, and anticoagulation for lone atrial flutter. It employs a retrospective cohort analysis and is set within a clinically based longitudinal study involving both inpatients and outpatients with atrial flutter.

The study compared the stroke rate in 59 patients with atrial flutter to rates in a sample with age- and sex-specific ischemic cerebrovascular event rates, as well as a sample of nonhypertensive patients with lone atrial fibrillation. The risk for developing atrial fibrillation after presenting with atrial flutter is also examined. Electrocardiograms and clinical data were collected and reviewed for each study participant.

Results indicate that after adjusting for age and sex, patients with atrial flutter had a higher incidence of thromboembolic events than the sample control patients and patients with atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation developed in 56% of patients with atrial flutter.

Conclusions drawn from the study suggest that lone atrial flutter has a stroke risk at least as high as lone atrial fibrillation, and it carries a higher risk for subsequent development of atrial fibrillation compared to the general population. Anticoagulation should be considered for all patients with atrial flutter who are older than 65 years.

### Successful treatment of neonatal atrial flutter by synchronized cardioversion: Case report and literature review [^111fKpyx]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Atrial flutter is characterized by saw-tooth flutter waves with an atrial rate of up to 500 beats per minute and is frequently associated with 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) conduction. The mechanism of atrial flutter is macro reentry within the atrial wall. AV block does not terminate atrial flutter because the AV node is not involved in the reentrant circuit. For this reason, adenosine cannot terminate atrial flutter but unmasks the flutter wave by causing AV block.

Atrial flutter accounts for nearly one-third of fetal tachyarrhythmias. It is observed only in the third trimester, probably related to the large atrial size achieved at 27–30 weeks of gestation, with high vulnerability to atrial extrasystoles. Accessory AV pathways and reentrant supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) are common associations. This fetal arrhythmia may be associated with myocarditis, positive SSA/SSB autoantibodies, or congenital heart disease such as Ebstein anomaly. Fetal atrial flutter can cause hydrops fetalis or fetal heart failure.

In fetuses with atrial flutter, sotalol is recommended in cases of hydrops. Sotalol has been effective in converting 50–80% of fetuses with atrial flutter without mortality. Digoxin or amiodarone may be considered as second-choice treatments. Procainamide is contraindicated.

- **Proarrhythmia**: Proarrhythmia means worsening of an arrhythmia as the result of treatment. AV indicates atrioventricular block; BBB, bundle-branch block; CNS, central nervous system; ECG, electrocardiogram; IV, intravenously; LD, loading dose; LQTS, long QT syndrome; MD, maintenance dose; PO, orally.

### Atrial fibrillation therapy now and in the future: drugs, biologicals, and ablation [^1167eAuj]. Circulation Research (2014). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a complex disease characterized by rapid and seemingly disorganized atrial activation, resulting from multiple interrelated causes. Therapy targeting AF is rapidly evolving and improving. This review aims to summarize state-of-the-art diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for the treatment of AF, focusing on treatment as it relates to the pathophysiological basis of the disease. It reviews both preclinical and clinical evidence for potential new diagnostic and therapeutic modalities, including imaging, biomarkers, pharmacological therapy, and ablative strategies for AF.

Ablation and drug therapy approaches primarily target the treatment of the arrhythmia once the substrate has developed. These approaches tend to be more effective in paroxysmal AF than in persistent or permanent AF. However, significant research is focused on prevention strategies, targeting the AF substrate — referred to as upstream therapy. Improved diagnostics using imaging, genetics, and biomarkers are needed to better identify AF subtypes based on the underlying substrate and mechanisms, thereby allowing for more directed therapeutic approaches. In addition, novel antiarrhythmics with more atrial-specific effects may reduce limiting proarrhythmic side effects. Advances in ablation therapy aim to improve technology to reduce procedure time and enhance mechanism-targeted approaches.

### Initial clinical experience with a novel visualization and virtual electrode radiofrequency ablation catheter to treat atrial flutter [^112A3MtV]. Heart Rhythm (2011). Low credibility.

Linear ablation lesions are used to treat various cardiac arrhythmias. Successful long-term outcomes are hampered by the uncertainty of catheter-tissue contact for any individual lesion and the difficulty in ensuring point-to-point lesion contiguity.

- **Objective**: A novel virtual electrode radiofrequency ablation catheter, equipped with an endoscope to directly visualize the target tissue, was used to ensure tissue contact and lesion contiguity along the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) for treating typical atrial flutter.

- **Methods**: In this feasibility study of five patients with drug-resistant CTI-dependent atrial flutter, catheter ablation was performed using the visualization virtual electrode radiofrequency ablation catheter. After standard femoral access, the ablation catheter was advanced to the tricuspid annulus under fluoroscopic and intracardiac echocardiography guidance. In three out of five patients, the ablation procedure was performed during atrial flutter, while in the other two cases, it was during coronary sinus pacing.

- **Results**: Conversion to sinus rhythm was noted after the delivery of 12 ± 7 lesions. Bidirectional CTI conduction block was achieved in all patients. Initially, transient CTI block was observed after delivering 19 ± 13 lesions; ultimately, 34 ± 18 lesions were necessary to achieve permanent bidirectional CTI block. The mean ablation and procedure times were 72 ± 42 and 151 ± 17 minutes, respectively. The mean fluoroscopy times for the ablation alone and the entire procedure were 13 ± 8 and 17 ± 7 minutes, respectively.
