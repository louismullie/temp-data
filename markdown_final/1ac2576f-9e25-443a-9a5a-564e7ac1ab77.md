## Question

aids vs hiv

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the difference between HIV and AIDS, including definitions, staging thresholds, natural history, epidemiology, and the impact of antiretroviral therapy on progression. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the causal relationship between HIV and AIDS. Then, I should define HIV infection as a virologic state and AIDS as a clinical syndrome with immunologic criteria. Next, I will map the CD4-based staging and opportunistic infection risks, quantify the epidemiologic burden, and contrast pathophysiology versus syndrome. Finally, I will assess how immediate ART changes the HIV-to-AIDS continuum and synthesize key takeaways for practice.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental causal relationship. HIV is the etiologic agent whose ongoing replication drives progressive CD4+ T-cell loss and immune dysfunction, and AIDS represents the advanced clinical stage of untreated or poorly controlled HIV in which specific opportunistic infections and malignancies emerge; in other words, HIV precedes and causes AIDS through immune system destruction, typically over years in the absence of therapy [^1138URXa].

> I need to define HIV infection precisely. HIV infection is the chronic virologic state characterized by viral entry at mucosal sites, dissemination to lymphoid tissues, persistent replication, chronic immune activation, and progressive CD4+ T-cell depletion, often with a prolonged asymptomatic period; in untreated individuals, the median time from acquisition to AIDS is roughly 8–10 years, and in the United States around the mid-2010s the incidence and prevalence were approximately 18 per 100,000 person-years and 381 per 100,000, respectively [^1138URXa].

> Hold on, I should verify the AIDS definition carefully. AIDS is defined by severe immunodeficiency, classically a CD4+ T-cell count less than 200 cells per microliter or the presence of any AIDS-defining illness such as Pneumocystis pneumonia, esophageal candidiasis, disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex, or certain malignancies; opportunistic infections can occur at higher CD4 thresholds but become common as CD4 counts fall below 200 and especially below 100, reflecting the syndromic nature of AIDS rather than merely a virologic label [^1138URXa].

> Wait, I earlier implied that "end-stage disease is characterized by CD4+ < 50" as though that were the defining criterion; let me correct that. The diagnostic threshold for AIDS is CD4+ < 200 cells/μL or an AIDS-defining condition, whereas CD4+ counts around or below 50 cells/μL indicate very advanced immunosuppression with high risk for certain OIs, not a separate diagnostic category; also, I should correct a unit slip from mL to μL to maintain accuracy [^1138URXa] [^112dn8ZX].

> Next, I should review the natural history staging. Early HIV disease generally corresponds to CD4+ counts above 500 cells/μL, mid-stage between 200 and 500, and advanced disease when counts drop below 200, with specific opportunistic risks increasing stepwise: risks like varicella-zoster and tuberculosis rise below 350–500, Pneumocystis pneumonia and esophageal candidiasis increase below roughly 250–200, and infections such as cryptococcosis, CMV, toxoplasmosis, and disseminated MAC become common below 100, defining the clinical bridge from HIV to AIDS in the absence of therapy [^1138URXa] [^112dn8ZX].

> I will now examine the epidemiologic impact to anchor the distinction in public health terms. Globally, about 37.9 million people were living with HIV in 2018, with approximately 770,000 AIDS-related deaths that year; crucially, deaths declined by roughly one-third since 2010 due to ART scale-up, underscoring how controlling HIV prevents progression to AIDS at the population level [^113Zy4Ub].

> Let me consider pathophysiology versus clinical syndrome to avoid conflating mechanism with definition. HIV denotes the active, persistent viral infection, reservoir persistence in anatomic sanctuaries such as gut-associated lymphoid tissue even during suppression, and the immunologic injury it causes, whereas AIDS refers to the clinical end-stage consequence of profound immunodeficiency meeting specific immunologic and clinical criteria; this distinction matters because viral suppression can maintain HIV as a chronic, non–AIDS state despite the virus's persistence in tissues [^1138URXa] [^112oCSGU].

> I need to ensure I capture the treatment impact on the HIV–AIDS continuum. Modern guidelines recommend initiating ART as soon as possible after diagnosis for essentially all patients, because suppressive ART prevents CD4 decline, averts most AIDS-defining illnesses, and transforms HIV from a fatal infection into a chronic manageable condition; the incidence of opportunistic infections drops dramatically with ART, to the point that routine primary prophylaxis for some OIs can be avoided when effective ART is started promptly [^114ATKZL] [^1129Mycy] [^1175b14S].

> Hold on, I should verify monitoring implications that reflect this clinical distinction. With durable viral suppression, CD4 counts generally recover over time, and follow-up CD4 monitoring can be spaced once counts rise above key thresholds, aligning with the principle that preventing virologic failure is the linchpin for preventing AIDS-defining complications and maintaining the patient in the HIV, not AIDS, category [^1146NMii] [^1138URXa].

> Let me synthesize the key take-home. HIV is the chronic viral infection that, without effective treatment, leads inexorably to immune collapse; AIDS is the clinical syndrome defined by a CD4+ count less than 200 cells/μL or the occurrence of AIDS-defining conditions, reflecting profound immunodeficiency; immediate, suppressive ART decouples HIV from inevitable progression to AIDS by preserving or restoring immune function and preventing opportunistic disease, which is the core therapeutic distinction clinicians operationalize in practice [^1138URXa] [^114ATKZL] [^1129Mycy].

HIV is the virus that causes AIDS, a late-stage disease defined by severe immunodeficiency and opportunistic infections or cancers [^1138URXa]. HIV is the **virus**; AIDS is the **syndrome**. HIV is diagnosed by detecting the virus or its antibodies [^114yhwn3], while AIDS is diagnosed by a CD4 count < 200 cells/μL or specific opportunistic illnesses [^112dn8ZX]. Early, continuous **ART** can prevent progression to AIDS and enable near-normal life expectancy [^114ATKZL] [^1145BkwQ], but without treatment, HIV typically progresses to AIDS over 8–10 years [^111gCPGw].

---

## Definitions and distinctions

HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a **retrovirus** that infects and destroys CD4+ T cells, causing progressive immunodeficiency [^1149wBcf], whereas **AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome)** is the advanced stage of HIV infection, defined by severe immunosuppression (CD4 < 200 cells/μL) or by specific opportunistic infections or malignancies [^1138URXa].

---

## Pathophysiology

### HIV infection

- **Acute infection**: Rapid viral replication and CD4+ T-cell depletion, especially in gut-associated lymphoid tissue [^1149wBcf] [^112FWJKh].

- **Chronic infection**: Persistent immune activation, gradual CD4+ decline, and chronic inflammation [^1149wBcf] [^111dwUff] [^1138URXa].

- **Latency**: HIV integrates into the host genome, forming reservoirs that persist despite ART [^112oCSGU] [^1138URXa].

---

### AIDS

- **Severe immunodeficiency**: Marked CD4+ depletion and immune dysfunction [^1138URXa].

- **Opportunistic infections**: Increased susceptibility to infections such as Pneumocystis pneumonia, tuberculosis, and cryptococcal meningitis [^1129Mycy].

- **Malignancies**: Higher risk of cancers like Kaposi sarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma [^116eToc1].

---

## Clinical progression

| **Stage** | **Clinical features** | **CD4+ count** | **Viral load** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Acute HIV infection [^1127N1G4] | - Flu-like symptoms <br/> - High infectivity | Normal or slightly reduced | High |
| Chronic HIV infection [^112dn8ZX] [^1138URXa] | Asymptomatic or mild symptoms | Gradual decline | Moderate |
| AIDS [^1138URXa] | - Severe immunodeficiency <br/> - Opportunistic infections <br/> - Malignancies | < 200 cells/μL | High |

---

## Diagnosis

### HIV diagnosis

- **Serological tests**: Detect HIV antibodies (ELISA, rapid tests) [^114yhwn3].

- **Molecular tests**: Detect HIV RNA or DNA (PCR) [^1127N1G4].

- **CD4+ count and viral load**: Monitor disease progression and treatment response [^1146NMii] [^1139tbkB] [^1138URXa].

---

### AIDS diagnosis

AIDS is diagnosed by a **CD4+ count** < 200 cells/μL [^1138URXa] or by the presence of **opportunistic infections** or malignancies [^112dn8ZX] [^1138URXa].

---

## Treatment

### HIV treatment

HIV treatment centers on **antiretroviral therapy (ART)** — a combination regimen that suppresses viral replication, preserves immune function, and prevents progression to AIDS [^114ATKZL] [^114oBpeU] [^1138URXa] — and on **early initiation**, which is recommended for all HIV-positive individuals regardless of CD4+ count [^112DeXQ5] [^116GAijX].

---

### AIDS treatment

AIDS treatment includes **ART** — essential to suppress HIV and restore immune function [^1138URXa] — and **opportunistic infection management**, including prophylaxis and treatment of infections and malignancies [^111mE1mU] [^1175b14S] [^1138URXa].

---

## Prognosis

HIV infection treated effectively with **ART** confers near-normal life expectancy and reduces the risk of progression to AIDS [^114usRM9] [^116GAijX]. In contrast, **AIDS** without treatment carries high mortality due to opportunistic infections and malignancies; ART significantly improves prognosis [^1138URXa].

---

## Prevention

HIV prevention involves safe sex practices, needle exchange programs, **pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)**, and **post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)** [^116AhRMR] [^114pwtDm]. Preventing AIDS entails early HIV diagnosis and consistent **ART** to prevent progression to **AIDS** [^114ATKZL] [^1138URXa].

---

## Global impact

The **HIV/AIDS epidemic** remains a significant global health burden, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa [^1134D2sJ] [^113Zy4Ub]. Progress has occurred as **ART** scale-up has reduced HIV incidence and AIDS-related mortality, though challenges remain [^1134D2sJ].

---

HIV is the virus that causes AIDS, a severe immunodeficiency syndrome. Early diagnosis and **ART** are critical to prevent progression to AIDS and improve outcomes [^114ATKZL] [^1138URXa].

### Natural history of HIV-1 infection [^112dn8ZX]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2000). Low credibility.

Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) results in progressive loss of immune function marked by depletion of the CD4+ T-lymphocytes, leading to opportunistic infections and malignancies characteristic of AIDS. Although both host and viral determinants influence the rate of disease progression, the median time from initial infection to the development of AIDS among untreated patients ranges from 8 to 10 years.

The clinical staging of HIV disease and the relative risk of developing opportunistic infections historically relied on the CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts. Although more recent studies have shown the importance of viral load quantitation in determining the rate of disease progression, it is still useful to categorize HIV disease stage on the basis of the degree of immunodeficiency: early disease (CD4+ > 500 cells/mL), mid-stage disease (CD4+ between 200 and 500 cells/mL), and end-stage disease (CD4+ < 50 cell/mL).

This article reviews the natural history of HIV disease at each stage of HIV-1 infection with emphasis on acute infection and the major virologic and immunologic determinants of disease progression.

### HIV infection [^1138URXa]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on human immunodeficiency virus infection:

- **Definition**: HIV infection is a chronic viral disease that, if untreated, leads to progressive T cell depletion with resultant infectious and oncological complications.

- **Pathophysiology**: HIV-1 is responsible for the vast majority of infections, while human immunodeficiency virus type 2 is relatively uncommon and follows a more indolent course.

- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the incidence and prevalence of HIV are estimated at 18 cases per 100,000 person-years and 380.9 persons per 100,000 population, respectively.

- **Disease course**: Infection begins by invasion of the target cells in a mucosa, following which the infection spreads to the lymphoid system. In untreated patients, the destruction of HIV-infected CD4 T cells results in immunodeficiency and chronic inflammation. CD4 T cell counts of < 350 cells/mcL are associated with an increased risk of complications such as varicella-zoster, tuberculosis, and other severe bacterial infections. The risk of opportunistic infections, such as pneumocystis pneumonia and esophageal candidiasis, increases with CD4 T cell counts of < 250 cells/mcL. CD4 T cell counts < 100 cells/mcL result in an increased risk of coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, CMV infection, histoplasmosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, disseminated M. avium complex, brain toxoplasmosis, HIV-associated wasting syndrome, and finally death.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The standardized mortality ratio for patients with HIV is estimated at 3.97 for those who have a lower CD4 T cell count, indicating a heightened risk for mortality.

### Primary HIV type 1 infection [^116g1m72]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Emerging evidence suggests that early events in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection may play a critical role in determining disease progression. Although there is limited evidence on which to base medical decisions, the diagnosis and treatment of acute HIV-1 infection may have virologic, immunologic, and clinical benefits. In addition, rapid diagnosis of infection may prevent unknowing transmission of HIV-1 during a period of high-level viremia.

We review the basic principles of primary HIV-1 infection, clinical and diagnostic markers of acute seroconversion, approaches to management, and new therapeutic strategies.

### Antiretroviral drugs for treatment and prevention of HIV infection in adults: 2018 recommendations of the International Antiviral Society-USA Panel [^112DeXQ5]. JAMA (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of human immunodeficiency virus infection, particularly concerning antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, the IAS 2018 guidelines recommend starting ART within the first two weeks for patients with cryptococcal meningitis in high-resource settings. This recommendation is contingent upon the availability of optimal antifungal therapy, frequent monitoring, and aggressive management of intracranial pressure.

### HIV viral load monitoring in resource-limited regions: Optional or necessary [^1139tbkB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Although it is a standard practice in high-income countries, determination of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) load is not recommended in developing countries because of the costs and technical constraints. As more countries establish the capacity to provide second-line therapy and as costs and technological constraints associated with viral load testing decrease, the question of whether determination of the viral load is necessary deserves attention.

Viral load testing could increase in importance as a guide for clinical decisions on when to switch to second-line treatment and on how to optimize the duration of the first-line treatment regimen. In addition, the viral load is a particularly useful tool for monitoring adherence to treatment, performing sentinel surveillance, and diagnosing HIV infection in children aged < 18 months. Rather than considering viral load data to be an unaffordable luxury, efforts should be made to ensure that viral load testing becomes affordable, simple, and easy to use in resource-limited settings.

### When to start antiretroviral therapy: The need for an evidence base during early HIV infection [^1145BkwQ]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

There are numerous studies available suggesting that untreated HIV, or ongoing viral replication, may be harmful to the host. Some experts argue that our contemporary understanding of the pathogenesis linking untreated HIV replication to end-organ diseases and cancer is so evident that earlier ART initiation would be justified without the need to conduct randomized trials. It is beyond the scope of this review article to critique this body of evidence. Collectively, these studies show that advanced and untreated HIV disease is detrimental to health, as is intermittent or ineffective use of ART compared to continued suppressive ART. Those individuals who experience better CD4 cell recovery will fare better than those who do not.

In fact, the standardized mortality ratio for the latter group — those able to recover to a CD4 count above 500 cells/μl from typically low nadir CD4 levels (< 200 cells/μl) — approaches one. This suggests that prior severe immunodeficiency may not lead to long-term harm as long as the person recovers a substantial number of CD4+ lymphocytes and hence experiences the optimal benefit of ART. When ART is initiated in patients with low nadir CD4 counts, recovery of CD4 cells may be less likely to occur within a given timespan, but is likely achievable in most patients if viral suppression is maintained. Recovery of CD4 counts to levels above 500 cells/μl occurs quickly in virtually all patients if ART is initiated around 350 cells/μl.

Importantly, none of these studies address the specific question focused on in this review.

Regarding the medical management of human immunodeficiency virus infection, specifically concerning ART initiation and opportunistic infections, the IAS 2018 guidelines recommend initiating ART within the first two weeks after the initiation of tuberculosis treatment for patients with CD4 cell counts less than 50 cells/mcL. For patients with CD4 cell counts of 50 cells/mcL or more, ART should be initiated within the first two to eight weeks.

### Incidence of opportunistic infections and the impact of antiretroviral therapy among HIV-infected adults in low- and middle-income countries: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1129Mycy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The impact of the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART) on the incidence and mortality of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated opportunistic infections (OIs) has been well documented in high-income countries (HICs). This improved survival has been associated with a progressive shift in the pattern of comorbidities, with an increasing contribution of chronic liver disease due to hepatitis C and B, cardiovascular disease, and non-AIDS malignancies.

In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), the global rollout of ART has led to over 15 million patients on ART and a 40% decline in HIV-related deaths since 2004. OIs remain the major driver of HIV-associated morbidity and mortality, accounting for the substantially higher mortality observed in LMICs. However, the ART impact on specific OIs has not been well documented, mainly because there is no routine country-level monitoring for OIs.

Reliable data on the relative burden of different OIs before and after ART initiation in different geographic regions is critical for planning health services, including procurement of relevant drugs and diagnostics. The few previous reviews on OI incidence either preceded the global scale-up of ART or addressed only specific OIs or regions. We have undertaken a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the incidence of key OIs in HIV-infected adults before and after the introduction of ART in LMICs across three regions (sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean), and to evaluate the magnitude of the effect of ART on the incidence of these infections.

### Executive summary: Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children: Recommendations from the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the American Academy of Pediatrics [^1116nbhx]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2013). Low credibility.

The guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections (OIs) in HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children in the United States were developed by a panel of specialists in pediatric HIV infection and infectious diseases from the U.S. government and academic institutions. These guidelines are intended for use by clinicians and healthcare workers providing medical care for HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children in the United States. For each OI, pediatric specialists with subject matter expertise reviewed the literature for new information since the last guidelines were published in 2009 and then proposed revised recommendations. These were reviewed and approved by the full panel and endorsing governmental agencies and professional organizations. This executive summary highlights the most important, rated recommendations for each OI from the full guidelines document.

### Reflections on 40 years of AIDS [^11155P8F]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Among high-income nations, the United States remains the most heavily affected country. In 2018, 37,881 new HIV infections were reported, with notable regional differences. In the South, the rate of new infections was more than twice that in the Midwest, which had the lowest rate. Significant disparities by race and ethnicity persist; the rate among Black/African American persons is twice that among Hispanic and eight times that among White persons. Factors indicating social deprivation and poverty are also associated with higher rates, even when accounting for racial and ethnic disparities. Among new HIV infections, 70% resulted from male-to-male sex. A cause for concern is the potential overlap between the HIV/AIDS and opioid epidemics through increased drug injection and needle sharing, which has led to explosive HIV outbreaks.

### Antiretroviral therapy for initial human immunodeficiency virus/AIDS treatment: Critical appraisal of the evidence from over 100 randomized trials and 400 systematic reviews and meta-analyses [^1141Vw7J]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2014). Low credibility.

There have been over 100 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of diverse regimens of antiretroviral therapy for treatment-naïve human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients. A further 400 systematic reviews and meta-analyses are informed by these trials. There are, however, difficulties in using systematic reviews and meta-analyses of this clinical evidence to inform guidelines and clinical practice. Several issues can make the interpretation of comparative effectiveness challenging.

- **Network geometry**: In this article, we review the key challenges in interpreting multiple trials in this population. We specifically examine the network geometry of the clinical trial comparisons.

- **Non-inferiority trial designs**: The predominance of non-inferiority trial designs is another challenge.

- **Potential class effects**: Issues related to potential class effects are considered.

- **Heterogeneous documentation of adverse events**: The documentation of adverse events can be heterogeneous, adding to the complexity.

- **Lack of RCTs meeting guideline recommendations**: There is a relative lack of RCTs that reflect specific clinical guideline recommendations.

We conclude with recommendations for future clinical trials and meta-analyses.

### Programmatic implications of acute and early HIV infection [^111U7Ckd]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection includes acute, early, chronic, and late stages. Acute HIV infection lasts approximately 3 weeks, and early HIV infection, which includes acute HIV infection, lasts approximately 7 weeks. Many testing and blood screening algorithms detect HIV antibodies about 3 weeks after HIV infection. Incidence estimates are based on results of modeling, cohort studies, surveillance, and/or assays. Viral load is the key modifiable risk factor for HIV transmission and peaks during acute and early HIV infection.

Empirical evidence characterizing the impact of acute and early HIV infection on the spread of the HIV epidemic is limited. Time trends of HIV prevalence collected from concentrated and generalized epidemics suggest that acute and early HIV infection may have a limited role in population HIV transmission. Collectively, these data suggest that acute and early HIV infection is relatively short and does not currently require fundamentally different programmatic approaches to manage the HIV/AIDS epidemic in most settings. Research and surveillance will inform which epidemic contexts and phases may require tailored strategies for these stages of HIV infection.

### Opportunistic infections in HIV disease: Down but not out [^113Lv6iz]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Despite the marked improvement in patient survival and reduction in the incidence of HIV-related opportunistic infections with the introduction of potent combination antiretroviral therapy, these infections remain a significant challenge in the management of HIV-infected patients. Ongoing issues that will require further study include a better characterization of immune reconstitution illnesses, other potential alterations in the natural history of opportunistic infections with antiretroviral therapy, and to what degree patients who experience failure of antiviral treatment become susceptible to various opportunistic processes.

### A systematic review of definitions of extreme phenotypes of HIV control and progression [^116bTN2V]. AIDS (2014). Low credibility.

Common definitions of HIV phenotypes

The most frequently occurring definitions for each term are listed in Table 5. Single dominant definitions that were clearly much more common than others could be identified for most terms, except HICs for whom two common definitions were identified. Although common definitions are clearly identified for each term, it can be noted that these still represent the minority of all definitions listed. It is also apparent that, although there are marked differences in the components of definitions for each term, in most cases specific component thresholds can be identified for each term that are far more common than others.

Using the most common components and component threshold/category within components to derive common definitions produced identical results to those produced by grouping individual definitions. For example, the most common definition for LTNP was an HIV-infected individual who is asymptomatic and ART-naive for 10 years during follow-up with all CD4+ cell counts above 500 cells/μl during this period, which combines the most common components and component thresholds/categories listed for definitions of this term.

### Joint estimation of CD4+ cell progression and survival in untreated individuals with HIV-1 infection [^114JqeeQ]. AIDS (2017). Low credibility.

A good characterization of HIV natural history is essential to track epidemic trends, estimate incidence, determine treatment needs, and estimate the impact of interventions to reduce AIDS mortality. Estimates of CD4+ cell progression and survival have been derived from analyses employing different approaches, combined to approximate a Markov transition model. CD4+ cell progression estimates tend to come from linear mixed effects models, while mortality estimates are generally derived from survival analyses. To consistently use both sources of data requires a Markov model for estimation, which simultaneously describes the process of CD4+ cell decline and survival.

There is evidence for increased disease progression by age across all exposure categories, but suggestions of differences between the sexes are inconclusive. Faster progression in persons from Africa compared with Europe, after adjusting for age, has been found in some studies, whereas others have found no significant differences. In addition, some studies report faster CD4+ cell decline and shorter survival in Asian cohorts compared with Europe or Africa. For example, Todd et al. report median gross survival times of 11.1 and 11.6 years in East and South Africa, respectively, and 7.5 years for Thai cohorts. Similarly, a comparison between the Concerted Action on Seroconversion to AIDS and Death in Europe (CASCADE) collaboration and the Beijing PRIMO cohort found significantly faster CD4+ cell decline in the Beijing cohort.

### Thirty years of HIV and AIDS: Future challenges and opportunities [^111ScKPp]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

As the third decade since AIDS was first recognized comes to an end, extraordinary advances have occurred in the understanding, treatment, and prevention of HIV infection and AIDS. As a result of these successes, it is now time to focus on future challenges. Paramount among these is reaching the goal of truly controlling and ultimately ending the HIV and AIDS pandemic. To that end, AIDS researchers and public health personnel worldwide are aggressively pursuing three key areas of scientific research. Given the availability of highly effective therapeutic regimens for HIV infection, the first challenge is efficiently identifying a maximum number of HIV-infected persons through voluntary HIV testing and initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART). Second, scientists are trying to develop a cure for HIV infection, which would alleviate the need for lifelong ART. Finally, preventing new cases of HIV infection, which currently number approximately 2.6 million per year globally, is critical to any attempt to end this pandemic. This article addresses each of these challenges and provides directions for the future.

### World AIDS Day - December 1, 2019 [^113hhKUt]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Low credibility.

World AIDS Day, observed annually on December 1, draws attention to the status of the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) epidemic. Approximately 37.9 million persons worldwide are living with HIV infection, including 1.7 million persons newly infected in 2018.

### Can biomarkers advance HIV research and care in the antiretroviral therapy era [^117RDbGU]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Despite achieving human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA suppression below levels of detection and, for most, improved CD4+ T-cell counts, those aging with HIV experience excess low-level inflammation, hypercoagulability, and immune dysfunction (chronic inflammation), compared with demographically and behaviorally similar uninfected individuals. A host of biomarkers that are linked to chronic inflammation are also associated with HIV-associated non-AIDS-defining events, including cardiovascular disease, many forms of cancer, liver disease, renal disease, neurocognitive decline, and osteoporosis. Furthermore, chronic HIV infection may interact with long-term treatment toxicity and weight gain after ART initiation.

These observations suggest that future biomarker-guided discovery and treatment may require attention to multiple biomarkers and, possibly, weighted indices. We are clinical trialists, epidemiologists, pragmatic trialists, and translational scientists. Together, we offer an operational definition of a biomarker and consider how biomarkers might facilitate progress along the translational pathway from therapeutic discovery to intervention trials and clinical management among people aging with or without HIV infection.

### Summarizing the results and methods of the 2019 Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS HIV estimates [^113Zy4Ub]. AIDS (2019). Low credibility.

The HIV epidemic and progress towards the 90–90–90 targets in 2019 emphasize global ambitions to reduce new HIV infections and AIDS deaths by 75% between 2010 and 2020. These goals are to be achieved by meeting the 90–90–90 targets for HIV testing, treatment, and viral suppression, alongside effective primary prevention strategies. Mahy et al. report positive progress towards these targets in the 2019 UNAIDS estimates, but substantial gaps remain.

Globally, there were an estimated 37.9 million (32.7–44.0 million) people living with HIV in 2018, with 1.7 million (1.4–2.3 million) new infections and 770,000 (570,000 to 1.1 million) AIDS-related deaths. Compared to 2010, HIV incidence at the global level has declined by 16%, whereas estimates of AIDS deaths have declined by 33%, primarily due to treatment scale-up. Despite these declines, global targets are not on track; only three countries are expected to achieve the 75% reduction in incidence target.

The greatest declines in AIDS deaths have occurred in Eastern and Southern Africa. However, new HIV infections have marginally increased in Latin America. Both new HIV infections and AIDS deaths are estimated to have increased in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, as well as in the Middle East and North Africa regions. Across all regions, declines in incidence and AIDS deaths have been greater among women compared to men.

Patients should be informed that Isentress is not a cure for HIV infection or AIDS. They should also be made aware that individuals taking Isentress may still acquire infections or other conditions common in people with HIV, known as opportunistic infections. It is crucial that patients remain under a physician's care during treatment with Isentress.

It is important to inform patients that Isentress does not reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact, sharing needles, or exposure to blood. Patients should be advised to continue practicing safer sex and to use latex or polyurethane condoms or other barrier methods to lower the risk of sexual contact with body fluids such as semen, vaginal secretions, or blood. They should also be advised never to re-use or share needles.

Physicians should instruct patients that if they miss a dose, they should take it as soon as they remember. If they only remember at the time of the next dose, they should be advised to skip the missed dose and continue with the regular schedule. Patients must not take two tablets of Isentress at the same time.

Patients should be instructed to read the package Insert before starting Isentress therapy and to re-read it each time the prescription is renewed. They should be instructed to inform their physician or pharmacist if they develop any unusual symptoms, or if any known symptoms persist or worsen.

### Post-treatment control or treated controllers? Viral remission in treated and untreated primary HIV infection [^115ZZrKW]. AIDS (2017). Low credibility.

An HIV cure will impose aviraemia that is sustained following the withdrawal of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Understanding the efficacy of novel interventions aimed at curing HIV requires characterization of both natural viral control and the effect of ART on viral control after treatment interruption.

- **Design**: Analysis of transient viral control in recent seroconverters in the Short Pulse Antiretroviral Therapy at Acute Seroconversion trial.

- **Methods**: We compared untreated and treated HIV seroconverters (n = 292) and identified periods of control (plasma HIV RNA < 400 copies/ml for ≥ 16 weeks off therapy) in 7.9% of ART-naive participants and in 12.0% overall. HIV DNA was measured by qPCR, and HIV-specific CD8 responses were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay (ELISpot). T-cell activation and exhaustion were measured by flow cytometry.

- **Results**: At baseline, future controllers had lower HIV DNA, lower plasma HIV RNA, higher CD4:CD8 ratios (all P < 0.001), and higher CD4 cell counts (P < 0.05) than noncontrollers. Among controllers, the only difference between the untreated and those who received ART was higher baseline HIV RNA in the latter (P = 0.003), supporting an added ART effect.

- **Conclusion**: Consideration of spontaneous remission in untreated individuals will be critical to avoid overestimating the effect size of new interventions used in HIV cure studies.

### The current pipeline of antiretroviral therapy: Expanding options and filling gaps [^112u64z2]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Low credibility.

Highly effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) has transformed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) care in the past three decades. Thirty years ago, how many would have imagined that a single-tablet daily ART regimen containing different drug classes could achieve sustained HIV-1 suppression and halt disease progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)? Despite this remarkable achievement, challenges in HIV care remain that require further innovation for ART. In this review, we focus on newly approved antiretroviral agents and those undergoing phase 2/3 clinical trials. These new antiretrovirals hold great promise to expand treatment options and fill gaps in HIV care.

Progress toward a vaccine has also been made, although this has yet to deliver a licensed product. In 2007, I wrote a review, Vaccines: 2007. This review, Vaccines: 2018, focuses on the progress in the past 11 years.

### Pathogenesis of infections in HIV-infected individuals: Insights from primary immunodeficiencies [^114nDMRm]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Following infection with almost any given microorganism other than an emerging pathogen, only a minority of individuals develop life-threatening clinical disease, implying that these individuals have some form of immunodeficiency. A growing number of inherited and acquired immunodeficiencies have been deciphered over the last 50 years. HIV infection is probably the best-known acquired immunodeficiency. It emerged about 40 years ago and precipitates various severe infections, the occurrence of which is associated with a fall in circulating CD4+ T cells. However, despite the strength of this correlation, infection rates differ between patients with similar levels and durations of CD4+ T lymphopenia in the presence or absence of antiretroviral treatment. Moreover, a few infections seem to be less dependent on total CD4+ T-cell levels. The fine detail of the mechanisms underlying these infections is unknown.

We discuss here how studies of the human genetics and immunology of some of these infections in patients with primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) have provided unique insights into their molecular and cellular basis. Defects of specific CD4+ Th-cell subsets account for some of these infections, as best exemplified by Th1* for mycobacteriosis and Th17 for candidiasis. PIDs are individually rare, but collectively much more common than initially thought, with new disorders being discovered at an ever-increasing pace and a global prevalence worldwide approaching that of HIV infection. Studies of known and new PIDs should make it possible to dissect the pathogenesis of most human infections.

### Hiv/aids epidemiology, pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment [^116WVeuV]. Lancet (2006). Low credibility.

The HIV-1 pandemic is a complex mix of diverse epidemics within and between countries and regions of the world and is undoubtedly the defining public-health crisis of our time. Research has deepened our understanding of how the virus replicates, manipulates, and hides in an infected person. Although our understanding of pathogenesis and transmission dynamics has become more nuanced and prevention options have expanded, a cure or protective vaccine remains elusive. Antiretroviral treatment has transformed AIDS from an inevitably fatal condition to a chronic, manageable disease in some settings. This transformation has yet to be realized in those parts of the world that continue to bear a disproportionate burden of new HIV-1 infections and are most affected by increasing morbidity and mortality. This seminar provides an update on epidemiology, pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention interventions pertinent to HIV-1.

### Hiv-1 transmission biology: selection and characteristics of infecting viruses [^114khSVB]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Individuals with recent human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) acquisition are likely to be a major source for other new infections because they have a high level of plasma virus, and the circulating virions possess unique properties that are highly suited for transmission. The acute infection period, however, presents a unique "window of opportunity" because there are a limited number of genetic variants.

Studies aim to elucidate the nature of the transmitted viruses and understand the mechanisms that inhibit the majority of variants present in the chronically infected partner from establishing a productive infection in the naive host. Greater understanding of these issues may open promising new ways to effectively block HIV-1 transmission.

### The global HIV and AIDS epidemic, 2001 [^114rCvHS]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2001). Low credibility.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are pandemic and pose one of the greatest challenges to global public health. As a bloodborne and sexually transmitted infection, HIV has variable patterns of transmission and impact among world regions and has disproportionately affected disadvantaged or marginalized persons such as commercial sex workers, injection drug users, men who have sex with men (MSM), and persons living in poverty. HIV infection has caused approximately 20 million deaths; an estimated 36 million persons are infected. On the basis of data from the Joint United Nations Program on AIDS (UNAIDS) and other sources, this report summarizes epidemiologic trends, highlights several HIV and AIDS prevention milestones, and describes some prevention activities for the coming decade.

### From HIV to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [^113vFWvS]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

From the onset of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic in the 1980s to the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, multiple viral pandemics have occurred, all associated with hematologic complications of varying severity.

- **Objective**: To review the hematologic complications associated with HIV and other viral pandemics. This includes theories regarding their causation and the incidence and clinical impact of these complications on infected patients.

- **Data sources**: Peer-reviewed medical literature and the author's personal experience.

- **Conclusions**: The HIV and other viral pandemics have been associated with a variety of hematologic complications that often cause significant morbidity and mortality in affected patients. HIV infection is associated with multiple hematologic disorders. Many of these disorders have a lower incidence in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy but still represent a major clinical problem for HIV-infected patients. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of HIV-related hematologic complications, including HIV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders, has evolved in recent years. Other viral pandemics, including H1N1 influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, and COVID-19, have also been associated with hematologic complications of varying severity. Our emerging understanding of the pathogenesis of the hematologic complications of HIV, COVID-19, and other viral pandemics may help in prevention, correct diagnosis, and treatment.

### The detection of acute HIV infection [^1127N1G4]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (AHI) can be defined as the time from HIV acquisition until seroconversion. Incident HIV infection is less well defined but comprises the time from the acquisition of HIV (acute infection) through seroconversion (early or primary HIV infection) and the following months until the infection has been well-established, as characterized by a stable HIV viral load (viral load set point) and evolution of antibodies with increased concentration and affinity for HIV antigens. During AHI, a viral latent pool reservoir develops, the immune system suffers irreparable damage, and the infected (often unsuspecting) host may be most contagious.

It has proved very difficult to find individuals with AHI either in longitudinal cohorts of subjects at high risk for acquiring the virus or through cross-sectional screening, and the opportunity for diagnosis is generally missed during this phase. We review the technical strategies for identifying individuals with acute or incident HIV infection. We conclude that further technical advances are essential to allow more widespread detection of patients with AHI and to affect HIV treatment outcomes and transmission prevention.

### HIV-1 and its causal relationship to immunosuppression and nervous system disease in AIDS: A review [^116eToc1]. Human Pathology (2000). Low credibility.

Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), caused by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), has claimed more than 10 million lives over the past 15 years. There are approximately 30 million HIV-positive people worldwide, 89% of whom reside in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. The intricate relationship between the virus and HIV-related human multisystem pathology prompted scientists to modify many previously established concepts about infectious diseases and immunology and to test new ones. The results of this work helped resolve many, albeit not all, long-standing problems concerning HIV-1 immune escape, its cellular tropism, and the pathogenesis of HIV-related immunosuppression and nervous system disease.

The most impressive advances have been made in antiretroviral drug treatment of HIV infection, which has resulted in dramatically reducing AIDS-related mortality, morbidity, and perinatal transmission. However, considering the magnitude of the worldwide HIV-AIDS pandemic, the prohibitive cost and unusually exacting nature of combination drug treatment, as well as the emergence of drug-resistant HIV mutants, mean the disease and virus remain formidable and unpredictable, particularly in the area of prevention and vaccine development. Here, we have reviewed the most pertinent recently published studies of various aspects of HIV/AIDS intended to answer the following questions: what have we learned and what remains to be determined regarding this unorthodox viral disorder?

### Initial plasma HIV-1 RNA levels and progression to AIDS in women and men [^1134fCQA]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

It is unclear whether there are differences between men and women with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in the plasma level of viral RNA (the viral load). In men, the initial viral load after seroconversion predicts the likelihood of progression to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), but the relation between the two has not been assessed in women. Currently, the guidelines for initiating antiretroviral therapy are applied uniformly to women and men.

- **Methods**: From 1988 through 1998, the viral load and the CD4+ lymphocyte count were measured approximately every six months in 156 male and 46 female injection-drug users who were followed prospectively after HIV-1 seroconversion.

- **Results**: The median initial viral load was 50,766 copies of HIV-1 RNA per milliliter in the men but only 15,103 copies per milliliter in the women (P < 0.001). The median initial CD4+ count did not differ significantly according to sex (659 and 672 cells per cubic millimeter, respectively). HIV-1 infection progressed to AIDS in 29 men and 15 women, and the risk of progression did not differ significantly according to sex. For each increase of 1 log in the viral load (on a base 10 scale), the hazard ratio for progression to AIDS was 1.55 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.97 to 2.47) among the men and 1.43 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.76 to 2.69) among the women. The median initial viral load was 77,822 HIV-1 RNA copies per milliliter in the men in whom AIDS developed and 40,634 copies per milliliter in the men in whom it did not; the corresponding values

Four decades after its discovery, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to impact millions of people worldwide, remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality globally, and incurs billions of dollars annually in direct healthcare costs and indirect socioeconomic costs. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in 2019, an estimated 26 million people were living with HIV. In recent years, international bodies have set goals to end the HIV epidemic: in 2014, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) introduced the "95–95–95" targets — that by 2030, 95% of people living with HIV globally would know their status, 95% of all people with diagnosed HIV infection would receive sustained antiretroviral therapy, and 95% of people living with HIV receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) would be virally suppressed. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals also call for an end to the AIDS epidemic by 2030. Unfortunately, despite a significant increase in ART coverage over the last 20 years and major progress in terms of reductions in HIV incidence and mortality, the latest estimates and projections indicate that the world is not on track to meet these goals, and progress may stall further as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Differences in HIV prevalence both within and between nations in SSA have been well-documented, as have differences between sexes and age groups. These differences have also changed over time, impacted in part by the onset, duration, location, and demographic targeting of different prevention and treatment interventions.

### Hiv/aids and covid-19: Shared lessons from 2 pandemics [^114Ekw1c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

The global experiences with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemics hold important lessons for preparing for, and responding to, future outbreaks of emerging or reemerging infectious diseases. Scores of infectious diseases have emerged or reemerged over the past four decades, and future outbreaks are inevitable. The next emerging pathogen will likely again come from unanticipated sources and pose puzzles in terms of microbiology, transmission, natural history, pathogenesis, and epidemiology. These will present challenges in developing countermeasures such as diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. Although dozens of lessons could be addressed, eight selected lessons common to HIV/AIDS and COVID-19 are discussed here.

Consideration of the commonality of lessons learned from HIV/AIDS and COVID-19, the two most devastating pandemics over the past half-century, will help us — and those who follow us — to minimize the impact of future outbreaks and prevent them from becoming global pandemics.

### Does HIV/AIDS funding undermine health systems [^115GM4nZ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2012). Low credibility.

Dear Sir:

We read with interest the recent article by Shepard and others, which attempted to evaluate the impact of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) funding on Rwanda's health system. The headline of the associated press release is assertive: "Six-Year Study in Rwanda Finds Influx of HIV/AIDS Funding Does Not Undermine Health Care Services for Other Diseases. Study Addresses Long-Standing Debate about Funding Imbalances for Global Diseases". However, the study's results are far from a definitive answer to the policy question of whether AIDS funding has undermined or enhanced efforts on non-AIDS service provision.

The main threat to the validity of this study relates to the assignment of treatment of HIV/AIDS funding to health centers. In 2008, Shepard and others collected retrospective data on the performance of 25 health centers that received HIV/AIDS funding between 2002 and 2007. These health centers are said to be "randomly selected as the intervention group" by Shepard and others and then "perfectly matched" to 25 other health centers serving as control units. Unfortunately, the intervention group was "randomly" selected only in the sense that Shepard and others chose to study them, not that the health centers in the intervention group were randomly assigned to treatment. Without random assignment and appropriate strategies for causal inference, there is likely to be treatment imbalance error, which arises from observable and unobservable differences between intervention and control centers. The non-random assignment of the interve

### Ending the HIV/AIDS pandemic [^115gHdHn]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

From a theoretical standpoint, the goal of ending the HIV/AIDS pandemic is achievable; however, it will require additional and sustained resources to make available the already existing scientific advances on local, regional, national, and global levels. From a practical standpoint, accomplishing this goal will be a substantial challenge. In this regard, the essential components in the effort toward achieving this most challenging goal would probably be the development of a moderately effective HIV vaccine together with optimal implementation of existing treatment and prevention modalities. As persons living with HIV or at risk of acquiring HIV who have access to treatment and prevention continue to benefit from the fruits of scientific advances, we must not take our sights off or waver in our pursuit of the ultimate goal of ending the epidemic as a global health catastrophe.

### Reflections on 40 years of AIDS [^114MdvyZ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

June 2021 marks the 40th anniversary of the first description of AIDS. On the 30th anniversary, we defined priorities as improving the use of existing interventions, clarifying the optimal use of HIV testing and antiretroviral therapy for prevention and treatment, continuing research, and ensuring the sustainability of the response. Despite scientific and programmatic progress, the end of AIDS is not in sight. Other major epidemics over the past decade have included Ebola, arbovirus infections, and coronavirus disease (COVID-19). A benchmark against which to compare other global interventions is the HIV/AIDS response in terms of funding, coordination, and solidarity. Lessons from Ebola and HIV/AIDS are pertinent to the COVID-19 response. The fifth decade of AIDS will have to position HIV/AIDS in the context of enhanced preparedness and capacity to respond to other potential pandemics and transnational health threats.

### Perspectives on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cure: HIV persistence in tissue [^112oCSGU]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The uneven anatomic distribution of cell subsets that harbor human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) during antiretroviral therapy (ART) complicates the investigation of the barriers to HIV cure. Here we propose that while previous studies done largely in blood cells have led to important investigations into HIV latency, other significant mechanisms of HIV persistence during ART may not be readily apparent in the bloodstream.

We specifically consider, as an example, the question of ongoing HIV replication during ART. We discuss how a growing understanding of key anatomic sanctuaries for the virus can inform future experiments aimed at further clarifying this issue.

### Hiv/aids vaccines: 2018 [^117U4fQx]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

The development of a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine faces numerous challenges. These include the virus's life cycle, which favors the rapid establishment of hard-to-clear chronic infections; the high diversity and structure of the envelope glycoprotein, limiting the ability to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs); and the tropism of the virus for T helper cells, which facilitates infection, spread, and persistence.

- **Challenges for HIV vaccine development**: Upon infection, HIV reverse transcribes its RNA to DNA, which integrates into the host genome as a DNA provirus. The provirus is established within hours of infection and presents as a chronic infection that can lie latent, making it unrecognizable by the immune system and uneradicated by drugs. Most vaccines work by expanding memory responses to limit disease; however, a protective memory response for HIV may need to prevent the establishment of proviral DNA.

### The gut microbiome in human immunodeficiency virus infection [^1119FLJ4]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Since the emergence of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic in the early 1980s and the discovery of its causative agent, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the deleterious effects of HIV infection on the human immune system, mainly on the CD4+ T cell compartment, have been extensively studied. Upon the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the burden of HIV-related morbidity and mortality dropped dramatically, although complete elimination of the disease has not yet been achieved. Additionally, effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) is accompanied by the emergence of long-term HIV- and treatment-related metabolic manifestations, suggesting that significant gaps remain in our comprehension of the mechanisms by which the virus exerts adverse effects on its host.

Considering that 60% of CD4+ T cells in the human body are estimated to reside in gut-associated lymphoid tissue, and since the reconstitution of these cell populations and the gut microbial composition is incomplete even under HAART, the human intestine has recently become the focus of attention in HIV research. Moreover, changes in gut microbial composition and function in HIV-positive individuals, aside from being secondary to HIV infection, may also play direct roles in mediating some disease manifestations. Potential mechanisms for such effects include local facilitation of viral infection, creation of viral sanctuary sites resistant to systemic ART treatment, and promotion of impaired gut mucosal barrier function, resulting in leakage of bacterial components.

### Incidence of opportunistic infections and the impact of antiretroviral therapy among HIV-infected adults in low- and middle-income countries: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117P1jAA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

We were limited in our ability to draw definitive conclusions on the importance of regional differences due to some imprecision in the estimates, as well as variability in diagnostic methods and inconsistency in ascertainment of cases. The low incidence of PCP and other opportunistic infections (OIs) in sub-Saharan Africa may be attributable to limited diagnostic resources and capacity, rather than true lower endemicity, and is supported by the lack of regional variation in those OIs that are predominantly diagnosed clinically.

Our analyses also provide a valuable approximation of the number of OIs averted and potential cost savings of $47 million per annum from initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) before the CD4 count declines to < 200 cells/µL. These estimates likely underestimate the full savings, as they do not capture variation in treatment costs across different countries or include the diagnostic costs. Although the costs of ART tend to be higher than the costs of treating OIs, the savings from averting these OIs are a substantial additional benefit of ART.

### The extended impact of human immunodeficiency virus/AIDS research [^112bjXXh]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is one of the most extensively studied viruses in history, leading to numerous extraordinary scientific advances. These include an in-depth understanding of viral biology, pathogenesis, and the development of life-saving antiretroviral therapies. Investments in HIV/AIDS research have been validated by these achievements. Additionally, the broader scientific progress resulting from support of HIV/AIDS research over the past 30 years is extraordinary.

The positive impact has ranged from innovations in basic immunology and structural biology to treatments for immune-mediated diseases and cancer. This progress has had an enormous effect on the research and public and global health communities, extending well beyond the field of HIV/AIDS. This article highlights a few select examples of the unanticipated and substantial positive spin-offs of HIV/AIDS research on other scientific areas.

### Prevention and initial management of HIV infection [^114pwtDm]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022).

Since July 2017, when "In the Clinic" last addressed management of HIV infection, there have been meaningful improvements in our ability to prevent HIV and to manage patients living with HIV. New approaches to pre-exposure prophylaxis and more effective treatments have made the elimination of HIV infection a feasible goal. The federal "Ending the HIV Epidemic" initiative aims at a 90% reduction in new HIV diagnoses by 2030. This article provides updated information on how clinicians should use these improvements to manage their patients who are at risk for HIV infection or are newly diagnosed with HIV.

### Human immunodeficiency virus/AIDS in the era of coronavirus disease 2019: A juxtaposition of 2 pandemics [^113RCmy9]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly impacted persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), interfering with critical health services for HIV prevention, treatment, and care. While there are multiple profiles of persons living with HIV and the impact of COVID-19 may differ for each, the severity of COVID-19 in persons with HIV is strongly related to the presence of comorbidities that increase the risk of severe disease in COVID-19 patients in the absence of HIV.

An effective response to the juxtaposition of the HIV and COVID-19 pandemics requires a novel, coordinated, and collaborative global effort of scientists, industry, and community partners. This cooperation is necessary to accelerate both basic and clinical research, as well as implementation science, to operationalize evidence-based interventions expeditiously in real-world settings. Accelerated development and clinical evaluation of prevention and treatment countermeasures are urgently needed to mitigate the juxtaposition of the HIV and COVID-19 pandemics.

### HIV infection [^111gCPGw]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Low credibility.

Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) usually leads to 8–10 years of asymptomatic infection before immune function deteriorates and AIDS develops. Without treatment, about 50% of infected people will die of AIDS over 10 years. With treatment, prognosis depends on age, CD4 cell count, and initial viral load.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of preventive interventions? What are the effects of different antiretroviral drug treatment regimens in HIV infection? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2007. Please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review. We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 17 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: combination treatments containing either CCR5 inhibitors or fusion inhibitors; early diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs); early and delayed antiretroviral treatment using triple antiretroviral regimens; and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based therapies.

### Understanding diabetes in patients with HIV/AIDS [^112e1Lvn]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2011). Low credibility.

This paper reviews the incidence, pathogenetic mechanisms, and management strategies of diabetes mellitus in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). It classifies patients based on the aetiopathogenetic mechanisms and proposes rational methods of management of the condition, focusing on aetiopathogenesis and concomitant pharmacotherapy.

### 25 years of HIV-1 research - progress and perspectives [^116wN2m5]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The first cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were described in homosexual men in the US in 1981. Several years later, in 1983 and 1984 respectively, French and American scientists confirmed that the causative agent for AIDS was a retrovirus, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Today, 25 years after the isolation of HIV-1, approximately 25 million individuals have died from AIDS, a number 60 times greater than the total number of American casualties in World War II; over 33 million people globally are infected and living with HIV-1. In 2007, 2.7 million individuals became newly infected with HIV-1, and 2 million AIDS deaths occurred. Regrettably, half of all people who are infected with HIV acquire the infection before the age of 25 years and are killed by AIDS before they turn 35. More than 95% of new HIV-1 infections arise in low- and middle-income nations, populations least likely to have access to antiretroviral therapy.

In the face of these daunting statistics and an unabated pandemic, we look back on the progress achieved in HIV-1 research, treatment, and policies, and look forward to the challenges that confront AIDS scientists, clinicians, and decision-makers for the next 25 years.

- **Achievements from basic research**: The basic research of HIV has made great strides over the past quarter century. Key discoveries, reviewed here in brief, have clarified the intricate steps used by the virus from entry into and exit from the cell. HIV-1 is an enveloped virus with glycoproteins on its surface, responsible for viral entry into cells.

### Rapid intra-host diversification and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in advanced HIV infection [^113w6ZPK]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Despite these limitations, our results in this study demonstrate the tremendous differences in intra-host SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity and evolution between people with advanced, poorly controlled HIV infection and those with well-controlled or no HIV infection. We propose that these differences stem from multifactorial impairments in antiviral defenses during advanced HIV infection, which:

1. Enable elevated early SARS-CoV-2 replication (and, thus, SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversification)
2. Present SARS-CoV-2 with a relatively low barrier to epitope-specific mutational escape.

By contrast, the virus may have less opportunity to diversify in people with well-controlled or no HIV infection, while stronger, more rapid, and potentially broader immune responses in these individuals create a relatively large barrier to escape. Regardless of the mechanism, however, the potential emergence of new pandemic virus variants in people with HIV who are not receiving effective ART remains highly concerning. This concern could be mitigated through active or passive immunizations that provide sufficient early protection to limit virus genetic diversification in this setting. However, our results also emphasize that efforts to control SARS-CoV-2 and potentially other viruses will benefit from addressing remaining gaps in the global approach to HIV infection.

### Emerging infectious diseases: A 10-year perspective from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [^116vJano]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

HIV/AIDS has resulted in the death of over 20 million people worldwide and is the leading cause of death among individuals aged 15–59 years. Approximately 40 million people are estimated to be living with HIV infection. In the United States, about 1 million individuals are infected with HIV, with 40,000 new infections occurring annually. Since its recognition in 1981, the disease has claimed more than half a million lives in the United States.

Despite these grim statistics, there is reason for hope. Basic research has provided significant insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of HIV disease. This knowledge led to the development of over 20 antiretroviral medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that target HIV, alongside novel strategies for prevention and vaccine development.

Use of combinations of drugs targeting different proteins involved in HIV pathogenesis, known as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), has dramatically reduced rates of death and illness in the United States and other industrialized countries. Although the death rate due to HIV/AIDS in Europe and North America has dropped by 80% since HAART was introduced, relatively few people in poor countries have benefitted. New initiatives such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief aim to significantly reduce the disparity between rich and poor countries in terms of access to HIV treatment, care, and prevention services.

### Why everyone (almost) with HIV needs to be on treatment: A review of the critical data [^116GAijX]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2019). Low credibility.

Since 2014, a consensus of landmark studies has justified starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) regardless of CD4 count. The evidence for immediate and universal ART is strong, clearly showing individual and population-level benefits, and is supported by all major guidelines groups. Altogether, improvements in ART and recognition of its clinical and epidemiologic benefits justify near-universal ART, preferably as soon after the diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as possible. Case-based discussions provide a framework to explore the evidence behind the recommendation for ART for all HIV-positive persons, and specific scenarios are discussed in which ART initiation may be delayed.

### Understanding diabetes in patients with HIV/AIDS [^111rKMwv]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2011). Low credibility.

Diabetes and HIV: Classification

Three subgroups of patients with diabetes and HIV can be identified: Patients with preexisting diabetes who contract HIV, those who are diagnosed with diabetes at the onset of HIV infection, and others who develop hyperglycemia after the start of therapy. These subgroups need to be managed differently, as the mechanisms of metabolic dysregulation vary among them.

Patients with HIV will certainly have the same rates of diabetes as seen in the background population. Because of their relatively younger age, HIV patients may have a lower incidence of preexisting diabetes when they get infected. However, as they grow older, they may develop diabetes in the normal course of events. Certain metabolic factors related to HIV and HIV therapy may increase the incidence of diabetes among them.

These factors will be discussed in the following paragraphs. This knowledge is of importance to treating physicians, as it will help them plan their mode of treatment.

Regarding the medical management of human immunodeficiency virus infection, with a specific focus on initial antiretroviral therapy (ART), the IAS 2018 guidelines recommend choosing among the following initial regimens for the treatment of HIV infection:

- **Bictegravir/tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine**:

- **Dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine**:

- **Dolutegravir plus tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine**:

### 25 years of HIV-1 research - progress and perspectives [^116SNxsC]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Twenty-five years after the discovery and isolation of the human immunodeficiency virus by French and American scientists, much progress has been made in basic research, clinical treatment, and public health prevention measures for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Here, we summarize, in brief, advances that have been achieved and provide some perspectives on future challenges.

### Beyond viral suppression of HIV - the new quality of life frontier [^112d63tZ]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Another consideration is the late diagnosis of HIV, which remains a major problem in countries at all income levels. Research suggests that even after achieving viral suppression, people who began antiretroviral therapy with severely weakened immune systems are vulnerable to a range of HIV-specific and non-HIV-specific diseases. The ideal would be to eliminate late diagnosis. However, many health systems worldwide continue to grapple with how to incentivize HIV testing sufficiently to achieve the 'first 90' target of diagnosing 90% of HIV-positive people. While work on this front continues, increasing our understanding of the health needs of virally suppressed PLHIV, including those diagnosed late, will yield clinical and operational guidance of immense value in virtually all healthcare settings worldwide.

Our final reason for urging suitably positioned countries to rise to the challenge of exploring what is needed for PLHIV "beyond viral suppression" relates to the changing dynamics of health systems. In recent years, experts have begun calling for health services and other health system elements to be centered on the needs of individuals and communities, departing from the disease-specific orientation that characterizes many aspects of health systems worldwide. However, there is no clear consensus about what 'people-centered health systems' should look like in practice. This issue has emerged at a time when health systems in some low- and middle-income countries are being severely strained.

### The evolution of assessing central nervous system complications in human immunodeficiency virus: Where do we go from here [^111G3sAW]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

In this fifth decade of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic, central nervous system (CNS) complications, including cognitive impairment and mental health issues, remain a burden for people with HIV (PWH) on antiretroviral therapy. Despite the persistence of these complications, which often co-occur, the underlying pathophysiology remains elusive, and consequently, treatments remain limited. To continue to grow our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of CNS complications among PWH, there is a need to reexamine our approaches, which are now more than two decades old.

At the 2021 National Institutes of Health-sponsored meeting on Biotypes of CNS Complications in PWH, the Neurobehavioral Working Group addressed the following:

- **Challenges inherent to determining CNS complications**: Addressed issues related to diagnosis and assessment complexities.
- **Heterogeneity in CNS complications**: Discussed the variability and diversity of complications presented by different individuals.
- **Problems and solutions for examining integrated biotypes**: Explored ways to integrate various biotypes for a more comprehensive understanding.

The review below provides a summary of the main points presented and discussed by the Neurobehavioral Working Group at the meeting.

### Immune dysregulation in human immunodeficiency virus infection: Know it, fix it, prevent it [^111dwUff]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Infection of humans by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes a progressive, multifactorial impairment of the immune system, eventually leading to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). No cure or vaccine exists yet against HIV infection. More worrisome is the fact that, despite having identified HIV as the cause of AIDS, we still do not understand what pathogenic mechanisms lead to the debacle of the immune system. In this review, we consider the extent and the limits of our knowledge of HIV pathogenesis and how this knowledge may be used to design preventive and therapeutic approaches.

### Immunopathogenesis of acute AIDS virus infection [^112FWJKh]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of chronic HIV infection has long been envisioned as a slow process of immune degradation ultimately leading to overt immune deficiency and AIDS. However, recent studies suggest that the massive viral replication of acute infection initiates the pathogenic process, significantly degrading the immune system and setting up a sequence of events that years later leads to final decompensation and AIDS. The central player of the disease process appears to be the CD4(+) effector memory T cell population that resides in the extra-lymphoid immune effector sites of the body (e.g. gut, lung, and genital tract) and has a crucial role in maintaining immune competence at the tissue-external environment interface. HIV and its monkey counterpart SIV specifically target these CCR5-expressing T cells, significantly depleting them in acute infection and, in AIDS-susceptible species (humans, Asian macaques), initiating and maintaining a state of hyperactivation that undermines their regeneration. With time, uncontrolled viral replication leads to the loss of these cells in tissue below a crucial threshold, resulting in increased susceptibility to opportunistic infection.

### Pathophysiology and management of cardiovascular disease in patients with HIV [^112G4uTy]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

The estimated HIV-infected population totals 36.9 million people. In higher-income countries, up to one-third of the HIV-infected population is 50 years or older, whereas this age group comprises roughly 10% of the HIV-infected population in low to middle-income areas. As access to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has improved throughout the world, mortality, including AIDS-related mortality, is declining. Several studies conducted in the era of cART suggest that the major causes of death are now non-AIDS related. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has become one of the leading causes of non-AIDS related morbidity and mortality, and, as seen in the general population, CVD event rates increase with age. Thus, as cART use continues to expand and patients grow older, the incidence of CVD will likely rise unless effective management strategies are developed.

### Management of newly diagnosed HIV infection [^115g9wbZ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

No field in medicine has moved as swiftly as HIV/AIDS over the past 35 years. Because of the rapid turnover of key information, this 'In the Clinic' focuses on essential principles of care for newly diagnosed adults with HIV-1 infection and how to prevent infection in persons at risk. To ensure continued usefulness, future directions in therapy and how to access updated information on a continuous basis are emphasized.

### Viral and host factors in the pathogenesis of HIV infection [^1149wBcf]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Recent studies suggest that the pathogenesis of HIV infection and AIDS involves two distinct phases. During acute infection, massive depletion of CD4+CCR5+ memory T cells within the mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue leads to major and potentially irreversible damage to CD4+ T-cell-mediated immune functions. The emergence of potent but ultimately ineffective cell-mediated and humoral responses to HIV leads to the chronic phase of infection, characterized by partial control of viral replication, chronic immune activation, progressive decline of the naïve and memory T-cell pool, and systemic CD4+ T-cell depletion. The identification of these two pathogenic phases of HIV infection could have important implications in terms of HIV therapy and vaccine development.
