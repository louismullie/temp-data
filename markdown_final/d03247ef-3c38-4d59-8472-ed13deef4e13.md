## Question

defference between dominant and recessive

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for an explanation of the difference between dominant and recessive inheritance, including definitions, mechanisms, examples, exceptions, and counseling implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions anchored in modern clinical genetics. Then, I should verify the molecular mechanisms that make an allele dominant versus recessive. Next, I will examine classic examples and the carrier concept. After that, I need to check for exceptions such as semidominance, reduced penetrance, and mixed inheritance. Finally, I should consider clinical implications for diagnosis, variant interpretation, and counseling, and close with a concise synthesis that acknowledges the spectrum of real-world inheritance patterns [^112WCoZU] [^114JcLFB].

> Let me first confirm the core definitions so I don't overgeneralize. Autosomal dominant conditions manifest when a single pathogenic variant on one allele is sufficient to cause disease, whereas autosomal recessive conditions require biallelic pathogenic variants, one on each allele, for disease expression; heterozygotes are typically unaffected carriers in classic recessive models, which is the traditional teaching and remains clinically useful for risk communication and family screening [^116ArvE8] [^113PVNcD].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanistic basis because definitions alone can be misleading. Dominant effects often arise from haploinsufficiency, where one functional copy is inadequate, or from dominant-negative effects in which a mutant protein interferes with the wild-type protein, and less commonly from gain-of-function mechanisms; by contrast, recessive effects typically reflect loss-of-function requiring biallelic inactivation, with the wild-type allele compensating in heterozygotes, aligning with metabolic robustness and dosage-sensitivity principles [^114JcLFB] [^111xhspj].

> Hold on, I should verify that these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive for a given gene. Indeed, the same gene can show both dominant and recessive presentations depending on variant type and context; for example, ITPR1 missense variants can cause Gillespie syndrome as dominant traits, whereas biallelic loss-of-function variants cause a clinically similar recessive phenotype, illustrating how allelic requirement and molecular mechanism together shape inheritance patterns rather than a rigid label [^113AzjVv] [^116HRu4M].

> Next, I should review concrete examples to anchor the concepts. Autosomal dominant examples include familial hypercholesterolemia due to LDLR variants, where heterozygotes have elevated LDL-C and homozygotes have markedly severe disease, and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease due to PKD1 or PKD2 variants; autosomal recessive examples include phenylketonuria due to biallelic PAH variants and cystic fibrosis due to biallelic CFTR variants, with heterozygotes generally asymptomatic in classic presentations [^116UFdX3] [^112HBCjH] [^111hCLSV] [^113PVNcD].

> I need to ensure I address the carrier concept carefully. In classic recessive disease, carriers have one pathogenic and one wild-type allele and are typically phenotypically normal, but wait, let me reconsider — recent data show that some carriers exhibit attenuated or intermediate phenotypes, as seen with PKU carriers who can have modest elevations in phenylalanine and subtle neurocognitive differences, reminding me not to overstate "unaffected" in counseling [^111hCLSV].

> But wait, what if the phenotype tracks with variant dosage rather than a binary carrier/affected dichotomy. Semidominant or incomplete dominance describes a dose-dependent effect where heterozygotes have an intermediate phenotype and homozygotes have more severe disease; familial hypercholesterolemia is a good clinical example, and this nuance matters for risk stratification and cascade screening in families [^116UFdX3].

> I should double-check for exceptions that confound simple Mendelian labels. Reduced penetrance and variable expressivity are common in dominant conditions, meaning some heterozygotes are unaffected or mildly affected; conversely, some genes show mixed inheritance with both dominant and recessive associations, and certain variants have been reported as both dominant and recessive depending on context, reinforcing the need to interpret variants within gene-specific allelic frameworks rather than inheritance labels alone [^114R41xz] [^114JcLFB] [^112WCoZU].

> Next, I should review how these concepts change clinical practice. For diagnostic interpretation, a single heterozygous variant may suffice to explain a dominant phenotype, whereas recessive disease generally requires two pathogenic variants in trans; cis versus trans phasing can provide moderate evidence for pathogenicity in recessive contexts, and ACMG/AMP guidelines codify these principles for variant classification and reporting [^116HRu4M] [^115mbQ7u] [^114JhKLN].

> Hold on, I should verify counseling implications so I don't omit practical points. In dominant conditions, each child of an affected individual has a 50% risk, enabling cascade testing and early intervention; in recessive conditions, carrier couples face a 25% risk of an affected child per pregnancy, making carrier screening and reproductive counseling essential, and guidelines emphasize clear communication about nuanced results and residual risks in PGT-M and general counseling settings [^113PVNcD] [^116pnKEA] [^113hRLyy].

> Let me synthesize succinctly, but I should confirm I'm not oversimplifying. Dominant traits typically manifest with one pathogenic allele via haploinsufficiency, dominant-negative, or gain-of-function mechanisms, whereas recessive traits generally require two pathogenic alleles with loss-of-function mechanisms; however, real-world genetics often spans a continuum with semidominant effects, reduced penetrance, and mixed inheritance, so accurate diagnosis and counseling hinge on integrating variant, gene, and phenotype data rather than relying on a binary label [^114JcLFB] [^112WCoZU] [^116HRu4M].

Dominant and recessive describe how **one versus two copies** of a variant shape phenotype [^112AC88D]. Dominant traits appear when **just one copy** of the variant is present (heterozygous), masking the wild-type allele [^113PVNcD], whereas recessive traits require **two copies** (homozygous) for expression, with heterozygotes typically showing no phenotype [^113PVNcD]. This distinction reflects **biological mechanisms** such as haploinsufficiency, dominant-negative effects, or gain-of-function for dominance [^114JcLFB], and loss-of-function or dosage compensation for recessiveness [^111xhspj]. Many genes show a **spectrum of dominance** [^112WCoZU], and environmental or genetic modifiers can shift expressivity, so penetrance is often incomplete [^114R41xz].

## Definitions and core distinctions

| **Attribute** | **Dominant** | **Recessive** |
|-|-|-|
| Allele copies needed | One (heterozygous) | Two (homozygous) |
| Heterozygote phenotype | Affected | Typically unaffected |
| Example | Huntington disease (HTT) | Cystic fibrosis (CFTR) |

## Molecular mechanisms underlying dominance and recessiveness

### Dominant traits

Dominant traits arise from **mechanisms** such as:

- **Haploinsufficiency**: One functional copy is insufficient (e.g. TP53, NF1) [^113AzjVv].
- **Dominant-negative effects**: Mutant protein interferes with wild-type (e.g. some collagen disorders) [^115eSubL].
- **Gain-of-function**: New or enhanced function causes disease (e.g. PRSS1 in hereditary pancreatitis) [^114JcLFB].

---

### Recessive traits

Recessive traits typically reflect **loss-of-function**, where both copies must be defective to produce a phenotype (e.g. PAH in PKU, GJB2 in deafness) [^1149stmZ]. Dosage compensation — whereby the wild-type allele compensates at ~50% expression — can prevent a phenotype in heterozygotes [^111xhspj].

---

## Examples in human genetics

| **Dominant examples** | **Recessive examples** |
|-|-|
| Huntington disease (HTT) | Cystic fibrosis (CFTR) |
| Marfan syndrome (FBN1) | Phenylketonuria (PAH) |
| Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) | Albinism (TYR, OCA2) |
| Familial hypercholesterolemia (LDLR) | Sickle cell disease (HBB) |

---

## Penetrance and expressivity

Penetrance is the **proportion of individuals with a genotype who express the phenotype** [^1134MDTx]; it is often incomplete, especially in dominant conditions, due to modifiers or environment [^114R41xz]. Expressivity refers to variability in phenotype severity among individuals with the same genotype; both are shaped by modifier genes, environment, and stochastic effects [^1134MDTx] [^114rEyHK].

---

## Exceptions and complexities

- **Codominance**: Both alleles contribute (e.g. AB blood group) [^117WMZZn].
- **Incomplete dominance**: Heterozygote is intermediate (e.g. familial hypercholesterolemia heterozygotes) [^116UFdX3].
- **Sex-linked inheritance**: X-linked traits show sex-specific patterns (e.g. hemophilia A, Duchenne muscular dystrophy) [^113PVNcD].
- **Polygenic traits**: Multiple genes and environment interact (e.g. height, diabetes) [^116v7PxH].

---

## Modern understanding and implications

Modern genetics recognizes that **many genes show a spectrum of dominance**, with heterozygotes sometimes displaying mild or late-onset phenotypes, complicating simple Mendelian labels [^112WCoZU]. Advances in sequencing and functional assays have revealed nuanced allelic effects, improving diagnosis and counseling [^112AC88D].

---

Dominant traits appear with one variant copy, whereas recessive traits require two; these labels reflect underlying molecular mechanisms and remain foundational for **clinical genetics, counseling, and research** [^116ArvE8].

### Mendelian inheritance revisited: dominance and recessiveness in medical genetics [^112AC88D]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2023). High credibility.

Understanding the consequences of genotype for phenotype (which ranges from molecule-level effects to whole-organism traits) is at the core of genetic diagnostics in medicine. Many measures of the deleteriousness of individual alleles exist, but these have limitations for predicting the clinical consequences. Various mechanisms can protect the organism from the adverse effects of functional variants, especially when the variant is paired with a wild type allele. Understanding why some alleles are harmful in the heterozygous state - representing dominant inheritance - but others only with the biallelic presence of pathogenic variants - representing recessive inheritance - is particularly important when faced with the deluge of rare genetic alterations identified by high throughput DNA sequencing. Both awareness of the specific quantitative and/or qualitative effects of individual variants and the elucidation of allelic and non-allelic interactions are essential to optimize genetic diagnosis and counselling.

### Gene expression drives the evolution of dominance [^114Z8L9N]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Dominance is a fundamental concept in molecular genetics and has implications for understanding patterns of genetic variation, evolution, and complex traits. However, despite its importance, the degree of dominance in natural populations is poorly quantified. Here, we leverage multiple mating systems in natural populations of Arabidopsis to co-estimate the distribution of fitness effects and dominance coefficients of new amino acid changing mutations. We find that more deleterious mutations are more likely to be recessive than less deleterious mutations. Further, this pattern holds across gene categories, but varies with the connectivity and expression patterns of genes. Our work argues that dominance arises as a consequence of the functional importance of genes and their optimal expression levels.

### Gene expression drives the evolution of dominance [^111xhspj]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The relationship between the fitness effects of heterozygous and homozygous genotypes at a locus, termed dominance, is a major factor that determines the fate of new alleles in a population, and has far reaching implications for genetic diseases and evolutionary genetics –. Several models have been theorized for the mechanism of dominance, starting with R. A. Fisher's model, which suggests that dominance arises via modifier mutations at other loci and that these loci are subject to selection. In response, S. Wright argued that selection would not be strong enough to maintain these modifier mutations. He proposed a different model (termed the "metabolic theory"), later extended by Kacser and Burns, predicting most mutations in enzymes will be recessive because the overall flux through a metabolic network is fairly robust to decreasing the amount of one of the enzymes of the pathway by one-half. Consequently, loss-of-function mutations have a more severe effect when homozygous than when heterozygous. An alternative model, posited by Haldane and further developed by Hurst and Randerson, suggested that recessivity is a consequence of selection for higher amounts of enzyme product because enzymes expressed at higher levels are able to tolerate environmental fluctuations and loss of function (LoF) mutations.

### Dominant versus recessive: molecular mechanisms in metabolic disease [^115mGSS5]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Inborn errors of metabolism used to be regarded as simple monogenic traits, but a closer look at how different alleles of a gene determine different phenotypes shows that the molecular mechanisms in the individual case are often complicated. Most metabolic disorders represent a spectrum of phenotypes from normal via attenuated to severe (and sometimes prenatally fatal), and disease manifestation is often influenced by other specific genetic or exogenous factors. The terms 'dominant' or 'recessive' relate to the functional consequences of differing alleles in the (compound) heterozygous individual; the terms are irrelevant for homozygous individuals and inappropriate for X-linked disorders. Mutations affecting the same amino acid residue may be associated with different inheritance patterns. True dominant inheritance in metabolism is rare; it may be found e.g. in tightly regulated biosynthetic pathways or when minor changes in metabolite concentrations have a functional effect. Some disorders such as erythropoietic protoporphyria show pseudodominant inheritance due to prevalent loss-of-function polymorphisms in the general population and are better acknowledged as recessive traits. The term 'variable expressivity' is not helpful with regard to autosomal recessive disorders when variable phenotypes are explained by different mutations in the respective gene. Clonal unmasking of a heterozygous mutation through somatic loss of the second allele, the main pathomechanism in inherited tumour predisposition syndromes, is rare in metabolic disorders, but focal congenital hyperinsulinism is a notable exception. Somatic mosaicism for an OTC gene mutation is given as an example of an apparently heterozygous mutation pattern in a boy with an X-linked disease.

### Special considerations in prognostic research in cancer involving genetic polymorphisms [^117WMZZn]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Recessive, dominant, codominant, and additive inheritance models: which one to investigate?

Genetic polymorphisms commonly consist of two different alleles (A and B). Thus, a person can carry two copies of the same allele (for example, AA and BB homozygous genotypes) or one of each allele (for example, AB heterozygous genotype). While tri-allelic (for example, AA, AB, BB, AC, and CC genotypes) and quadri-allelic polymorphisms (AA, AB, BB, AC, CC, AD, and DD genotypes) also exist in the human genome, albeit at a much lower frequency, in this article we develop our discussion around the bi-allelic polymorphisms.

Usually, the genetic effects of each of the three genotypes (AA, AB, and BB) on prognosis are unknown and thus consideration of different genetic inheritance models may be required during statistical analysis. Most commonly used genetic models are the recessive, dominant, codominant and additive genetic models. In these genetic models, when the risk allele is unknown (whether it is the major or the minor allele, for example), the genetic model can be defined after the minor allele assuming that the minor allele is the risk allele. In such a case, in the recessive model, patients with homozygous (two) minor alleles (for example, patients with the BB genotype) are considered to be different from the group of patients with both homozygous major allele (patients with the AA genotype) and heterozygote genotype (patients with the AB genotype) in terms of their clinical and prognostic characteristics. In the dominant model, the assumption is that only one minor allele is enough to predict the outcome, thus the patients with BB and AB (containing at least one minor allele) are grouped together and compared with the AA patients. In the codominant model (also called discrete model), the assumption is that the heterozygotes (AB) have a distinct effect, which is different than the effects of minor (BB) and major (AA) homozygote genotypes; therefore, a comparison of these three groups is performed (usually where the major allele homozygotes (AA) serve as a reference group and compared with AB and BB genotypes separately). In the additive model, it is assumed that the effect of heterozygote genotype (AB) is in between the effects of minor homozygote genotype (BB) and major homozygote genotype (AA) in a dose-dependent manner.

### Dominance vs epistasis: the biophysical origins and plasticity of genetic interactions within and between alleles [^11234jbu]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

An important challenge in genetics, evolution and biotechnology is to understand and predict how mutations combine to alter phenotypes, including molecular activities, fitness and disease. In diploids, mutations in a gene can combine on the same chromosome or on different chromosomes as a "heteroallelic combination". However, a direct comparison of the extent, sign, and stability of the genetic interactions between variants within and between alleles is lacking. Here we use thermodynamic models of protein folding and ligand-binding to show that interactions between mutations within and between alleles are expected in even very simple biophysical systems. Protein folding alone generates within-allele interactions and a single molecular interaction is sufficient to cause between-allele interactions and dominance. These interactions change differently, quantitatively and qualitatively as a system becomes more complex. Altering the concentration of a ligand can, for example, switch alleles from dominant to recessive. Our results show that intra-molecular epistasis and dominance should be widely expected in even the simplest biological systems but also reinforce the view that they are plastic system properties and so a formidable challenge to predict. Accurate prediction of both intra-molecular epistasis and dominance will require either detailed mechanistic understanding and experimental parameterization or brute-force measurement and learning.

### Exploring the complex spectrum of dominance and recessiveness in genetic cardiomyopathies [^112WCoZU]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2023). High credibility.

The insights into CM genetics in this study demonstrated that most genes are likely to exist on a spectrum of dominant and recessive inheritance rather than acting purely through either model. This complements recent insights from large-scale biobank studies that many variants associated with recessive disease demonstrate phenotypic effects in heterozygosity. Understanding the particular characteristics and phenotypic associations of each disease gene and variant class will enable more effective interpretation of variants detected in individuals. Monoallelic and biallelic associations may be regarded as single semidominant conditions with differences restricted to severity or age at onset or distinct conditions where differences in phenotype or molecular mechanism are more pronounced. For genes discovered through and largely associated with recessive inheritance, this can range from a pure recessive model to a semidominant-like model where heterozygous variants can be causal factors for later-onset and less severe disease. For such genes, the severity and age at onset of the recessive phenotype appears to correlate with the likelihood, and effect size, of a monoallelic association (Fig. 5b). We also observed a spectrum of phenotypic severity and penetrance for genes largely associated with dominant inheritance, which is probably specific to variant class and even individual variants. Genes with variants that are generally associated with lower penetrance are more likely to be observed in homozygosity in patients and may therefore be more prevalent disease genes in populations of high consanguinity.

### The effects of quantitative trait architecture on detection power in short-term artificial selection experiments [^1134jNYY]. G3 (2020). Medium credibility.

Figure 7
Dominance affects power differently depending on how power is evaluated and what level of false positive rate is tolerated. Top: ROC curves (A) Power evaluated as proportion of QTL detected. (B) Power evaluated as proportion of genetic variance explained by detected QTL. Bottom: Distribution of transformed-D over 100 simulation replicates (C) Additive. (D) Dominant. (E) Recessive. Models with 10 QTL are used in this figure. Additive: heterozygotes express intermediate phenotype. Dominant: heterozygotes express the same phenotype as derived homozygotes. Recessive: heterozygotes express the same phenotype as ancestral homozygotes. Solid vs. dotted lines: see Figure 2 caption.

When derived alleles are completely recessive, only those with high starting frequency can form homozygotes and thus be visible to selection (Figure S8). All other derived alleles behave essentially like neutral alleles initially (Figure 7C & 7E). As a result, an overall lower number of QTL can be detected (Figure 7A). However, these high-frequency QTL are also the ones that contribute most to genetic variance in the first generation. Therefore, the proportion of genetic variance detected is even higher than in the standard model (Figure 7B). These results demonstrate again how a relatively simple aspect of the trait architecture - here the dominance relationship at individual QTL - can affect detection power in complex ways, where the direction of the effect depends on the false positive rate and the definition being used to measure power.

### Systematic large-scale study of the inheritance mode of mendelian disorders provides new insight into human diseasome [^114Hi55s]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2014). Low credibility.

One important piece of information about the human Mendelian disorders is the mode of inheritance. Recent studies of human genetic diseases on a large scale have provided many novel insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms. However, most successful analyses ignored the mode of inheritance of diseases, which severely limits our understanding of human disease mechanisms relating to the mode of inheritance at the large scale. Therefore, we here conducted a systematic large-scale study of the inheritance mode of Mendelian disorders, to bring new insight into human diseases. Our analyses include the comparison between dominant and recessive disease genes on both genomic and proteomic characteristics, Mendelian mutations, protein network properties and disease connections on both the genetic and the population levels. We found that dominant disease genes are more functionally central, topological central and more sensitive to disease outcome. On the basis of these findings, we suggested that dominant diseases should have higher genetic heterogeneity and should have more comprehensive connections with each other compared with recessive diseases, a prediction we confirm by disease network and disease comorbidity.

### Carriers of autosomal recessive conditions: are they really' unaffected?' [^111hCLSV]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Mendel's Law of Dominance suggests that recessive disease expression requires the inheritance of two mutated alleles as the dominant, wildtype allele suppresses disease presentation leading to the expression of physiological normal phenotypes. However, there is existing evidence that challenges this school of thought. Here, we summarise existing literature evaluating metabolic and health impacts among carriers of autosomal recessive conditions, focusing on phenylketonuria (PKU), classical homocystinuria, galactosemia and Usher syndrome as examples. Our findings suggest that carriers, often described as 'unaffected', may actually display attenuated symptoms for the recessive disease they are carrying. For instance, PKU is an inborn error of metabolism characterised by the build-up of plasma phenylalanine attributed to the deficiency of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme. While less severe, PKU carriers also exhibit this impaired enzymatic activity, leading to elevated plasma phenylalanine levels, especially after phenylalanine consumption. Related to these metabolic alterations in the PAH pathway, there is early evidence to suggest that PKU carriers may have compromised cognitive and mental health outcomes. Overall, research on the health and metabolic impacts of PKU carriers is sparse, with most studies conducted several decades ago. However, early evidence suggests that intermediate phenotypes among carriers of autosomal recessive conditions are plausible. The illustrated possible intermediate phenotypes observed among carriers necessitates future research to determine possible clinical implications among this population.

Modes of inheritance — An overview of modes of inheritance describes how genetic disorders are transmitted within families, noting that patterns depend on the type of genomic alterations involved and whether they follow dominant, recessive, or sex-linked inheritance, and that understanding these modes is important for predicting the probability of a disorder occurring in future generations.

### Exploring the complex spectrum of dominance and recessiveness in genetic cardiomyopathies [^11225obE]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2023). High credibility.

Discrete categorization of Mendelian disease genes into dominant and recessive models often oversimplifies their underlying genetic architecture. Cardiomyopathies (CMs) are genetic diseases with complex etiologies for which an increasing number of recessive associations have recently been proposed. Here, we comprehensively analyze all published evidence pertaining to biallelic variation associated with CM phenotypes to identify high-confidence recessive genes and explore the spectrum of monoallelic and biallelic variant effects in established recessive and dominant disease genes. We classify 18 genes with robust recessive association with CMs, largely characterized by dilated phenotypes, early disease onset and severe outcomes. Several of these genes have monoallelic association with disease outcomes and cardiac traits in the UK Biobank, including LMOD2 and ALPK3 with dilated and hypertrophic CM, respectively. Our data provide insights into the complex spectrum of dominance and recessiveness in genetic heart disease and demonstrate how such approaches enable the discovery of unexplored genetic associations.

### Toward robust clinical genome interpretation: developing a consistent terminology to characterize mendelian disease-gene relationships-allelic requirement, inheritance modes, and disease mechanisms [^116HRu4M]. Genetics in Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

As the next step to facilitate harmonized gene-disease validity assessments and support variant classification within the ACMG/AMP framework, the GenCC has focused on developing standardized terminology for the characterization of disease mode of inheritance, allelic requirement, and disease-associated variant consequences. Currently, groups utilize different terminology to describe these 3 characteristics. The considerable discrepancy in the derivation and application of these terms generates confusion and risks discordant assertions about pathogenicity of different classes of variants.

Although there is a close conceptual relationship between inheritance and allelic requirement, they are distinct and serve different purposes. Inheritance is used for describing the mode of transmission of a phenotype, eg, autosomal dominant and is particularly applicable in the clinical setting for communicating recurrence risk and to guide family screening and reproductive advice. Allelic requirement describes how many alleles must be affected to cause the relevant disease, eg, 1 allele (monoallelic) in dominant disease and both alleles (biallelic) in recessive disease. It is necessary for variant annotation pipelines and to determine if a given variant in a specific context is relevant to the phenotype of the patient, eg, a single heterozygous variant (in the absence of compound heterozygosity) may provide a diagnosis for dominant disease, but is insufficient to explain recessive disease, where a second contributory variant or alternative cause should be sought.

### Dominance vs epistasis: the biophysical origins and plasticity of genetic interactions within and between alleles [^114cHqY2]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

We have analyzed here how mutations interact within and between the two alleles of a gene in simple thermodynamic models of protein folding and binding in a one-gene diploid system. Our results show that protein folding on its own is expected to generate within-allele interactions (intra-molecular epistasis) but not between-allele interactions and dominance. However, the addition of a single binding reaction is sufficient to generate between-allele interactions and dominance.

How two mutations interact often differs in both magnitude and sign depending upon whether they combine within the same allele or in different alleles. Moreover, interactions depend qualitatively and quantitatively on both the biophysical effects of mutations and the context, with, for example, a change in the concentration of a ligand sufficient to switch a mutation from dominant to recessive in even the simple system of a protein that folds and binds a single ligand.

Taken together, our results illustrate that double mutant interactions are to be widely expected in even the simplest one-gene diploid biological systems, but also emphasize that they are system properties and therefore difficult to predict.

That dominance, between- and within-allele interactions are (1) expected in even the simplest systems, (2) context-dependent, and (3) difficult to predict – has important implications for human genetics, biotechnology, and evolution. As an example, our results suggest that it is not unreasonable to expect disease-causing alleles to switch from dominant to recessive depending upon the conditions, examined phenotype or individual. Indeed, examples exist in human clinical genetics of variants reported to be both dominant and recessive, for example in Marfan syndrome.

Different and sometimes even opposite interaction patterns for the same pair of variants when they are combined on one allele rather than in two different alleles of a gene reinforces the importance of phasing variants into haplotypes in human genetics –.

### Discovering genetic interactions bridging pathways in genome-wide association studies [^116t1m3V]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Dependence of interaction discoveries on disease model

While we tested multiple disease models (additive, dominant, recessive, and combined dominant–recessive), the most significant discoveries for the majority of diseases examined were reported when using a dominant or combined model as measured by our SNP–SNP interaction metric. The relative frequency of interactions under a dominant vs. a recessive model may be largely due to our increased power to detect interactions between SNPs with dominant effects compared to recessive effects. More specifically, individuals with both heterozygous and homozygous (minor allele) genotypes at two interacting loci would be affected under a dominant disease model, while only individuals with homozygous (minor allele) genotypes would be affected in a recessive disease model. The number of individuals homozygous at two interacting loci can be quite small depending on the allele frequency, which limits our power to discover them. Thus, the larger number of discoveries based on a dominant model assumption relative to a recessive model is likely a reflection of difference in statistical power and not an indication that genetic interactions among alleles with dominant effects are contributing more strongly to disease risk. We observed that interactions derived from an additive disease model provided the fewest significant discoveries when used in the context of BridGE based on the pilot experiments (Supplementary Data 21). To understand this, we investigated whether the SNP–SNP interactions supporting the BPMs discovered under the combined dominant–recessive model for the PD-NIA cohort were non-additive when evaluated using a logistic regression-based interaction test as opposed to the direct association tests used for our dominant and recessive disease models. Most SNP–SNP interactions supporting the PD-NIA discoveries were indeed non-additive when assessed using the logistic regression framework, but these were not necessarily ranked among the highest SNP–SNP pairs when assessed in the context of a logistic regression model (Supplementary Data 22), which may explain the difference in results under the additive vs. recessive or dominant disease models. An important distinction between the SNP-level interaction metric we use is that we specifically identify the small subset of individuals with the appropriate combination of genotypes (dominant model: heterozygous for minor allele at two candidate loci; recessive model: homozygous for minor allele at two candidate loci), and directly test for association with the disease phenotype, whereas for the additive model, an interaction term must explain a sufficient fraction of the variance across the entire population for it to reach significance. This distinction may play a role in why we are able to discover pathway-level genetic interactions with the metric proposed here but rarely with a standard additive model. It is worth noting that the core of the BridGE approach, discovering genetic interactions in aggregate rather than in isolation, is readily adaptable to other disease models or other statistical measures of interaction. Further exploration of different disease models as well as different statistical measures of interaction, would be worthwhile.

### Genetic model testing and statistical power in population-based association studies of quantitative traits [^115v5F3u]. Genetic Epidemiology (2007). Low credibility.

The optimal method for considering different genetic models in association studies is not clear. We compared analytical strategies that use different genetic models to analyze genotype-phenotype information from association studies of quantitative traits in unrelated individuals. We created simulated datasets where the minor alleles are causal with an additive, dominant, or recessive mode of inheritance over a range of allele frequencies. We then computed power to detect these causal alleles using one or a combination of statistical models in a standard regression framework, including corrections for the multiple testing incurred by analyzing multiple models. Our results show that, as expected, maximal power is achieved when we test a single genetic model that matches the actual underlying mode of inheritance of the causal allele. When the inheritance pattern of the causal allele is unknown, the co-dominant model, a single two degrees of freedom test, has good overall performance in any of the three simple modes of inheritance simulated. Alternatively, it is slightly more powerful to analyze all three genetic models together (additive, dominant, and recessive), but only if the significance thresholds used to correct for analyzing multiple models are appropriately determined (such as by permutation). Finally, a commonly employed approach, testing the additive model alone, performs poorly for recessive causal alleles when the minor allele frequency is not close to 50%. Our observations were confirmed by analyzing an existing genetic association dataset in which we detect the effect of a KCNJ11 variant on insulinogenic index in unrelated non-diabetic individuals.

Methods

Phenotypes

To study how mutations in a protein-coding gene combine in a diploid system, we first defined the phenotype (W) in the system as functional molecule concentration inside the cell relative to the wild-type diploid situation. These functional molecules can be folded proteins or a protein-ligand complex. In each model, the phenotype of a mutant is normalized to the homozygous wild-type (WT) phenotypes so that(arbitrary unit) and the complete loss of function is set to 0. With the simple assumption of additivity in the functional molecule concentrations, we imposed a lower bound of the expected simple heterozygote phenotype (i.e. any single mutants or any double mutants' expected phenotypes within the same allele) to 0.5 AU (half the wild-type phenotype) (Fig. 1b).

Expected phenotypes, interaction scores and dominance scores

When there is only one mutation A, the homozygote is annotated as (α A / α A) and the heterozygote with the wild type is annotated as (α A / α WT). The compound heterozygote is annotated as (α A / α B) while the heterozygous double mutant with both variants present in the same allele is designated (α AB / α WT). For a given pair of single mutant phenotypes, there are two expected double mutant phenotypes based on additive and log-additive expectations as shown in equations Eqs. (7, 8). For a given pair of homozygous mutant phenotypes, the expected double compound heterozygotes' phenotypes are given as the average of the parental phenotypes based on the widely used assumption for dominance calculation, as shown in equation Eq. (5). Interactions between mutations are quantified as differences between observed versus expected phenotypes as shown in Fig. 1.

### Exploring the complex spectrum of dominance and recessiveness in genetic cardiomyopathies [^1136ytUj]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2023). High credibility.

The inclusion of the robustly associated CM genes described in this study in diagnostic gene panels probably has clinical utility, especially for the particular ancestries and patient groups where these genes may be more prevalent causes of disease. This will require comprehensive evaluation of the reported evidence, particularly by the ClinGen gene–disease curation initiative, which has been one of the notable efforts undertaken in recent years to define robust and clinically actionable associations for inclusion in genetic testing panels. Although most of the studies evaluated in this study were published after the initial CM ClinGen curations were initiated –, future re-curation efforts will classify these associations using its standardized scoring system and aided by the collated published evidence described in this study. The ClinGen framework evaluates both dominant and recessive inheritance models, although it arguably does not sufficiently weigh the highly informative nature of replicated trio-style approaches for identifying pathogenic variants in rare recessive disease genes, even in pedigrees of limited size, and the extreme rarity of such genotypes in the population compared to heterozygous variants. Importantly, for genes with both monoallelic and biallelic associations, these curation efforts will need to determine whether these should be evaluated together as a single semidominant condition or whether there are sufficient differences in phenotype or mechanism of disease for them to be considered as two distinct entities.

In conclusion, we characterized the rapid expansion of CM genetic associations driven by studies of recessive inheritance and demonstrated gene-specific spectrums of effects across monoallelic and biallelic variants. The approaches described in this article can be applied across other diseases with similarly complex genetic architectures to characterize gene–disease relationships and identify new associations. This study highlights the need for integrated research efforts to define genetic etiology and more comprehensive clinical genetic testing of patients and at-risk individuals.

### Prevalence of loss-of-function, gain-of-function and dominant-negative mechanisms across genetic disease phenotypes [^114JcLFB]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Prevalence of molecular mechanisms across disease phenotypes

Motivated by these findings, we set out to assess the prevalence of molecular mechanisms across genetic disease phenotypes. We first classified disease phenotypes on the basis of their inheritance. Specifically, genes can show either exclusively autosomal dominant (AD) or autosomal recessive (AR) inheritance, or they may show mixed inheritance, being associated with both dominant and recessive variants. Dominant and recessive variants in mixed-inheritance genes may be associated with distinct phenotypes, in which case we can consider the dominant ([AD]-AD/AR mixed) or recessive ([AR]-AD/AR mixed) phenotypes separately. In contrast, as we only have gene-level phenotype:inheritance associations available from OMIM, for those genes with mixed-inheritance associated with the same phenotype, we are unable to distinguish between dominant and recessive variants, so they are considered together (AD/AR same). We also classified AD phenotypes on the basis of molecular mechanisms, using our previous gene-level LOF, GOF and DN annotations. These phenotype classifications are summarised in Table 2.

### Penetrance and expressivity in the molecular age [^114rEyHK]. Genetics in Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Penetrance and expressivity have been defined through clinical experience. Although penetrance is often seen as the end of the spectrum of expressivity, penetrance and expressivity are considered as distinct phenomena. A review of the known mechanisms underlying either penetrance or expressivity reveals that in most of the cases the same explanation is true for both phenomena. Some of the known mechanisms include modifier genes, the influence of the allele in trans, sex, and environmental factors. Although rapid progress has been made in understanding of the basis of incomplete penetrance and the differences of expressivity, they still remain unknown for most of the genetic disorders. In recent years, it has become evident that there is much in common between the classical Mendelian traits in which the inheritance has been seen as "simple" and most of the common diseases in which the inheritance is "complex". In both cases genetic and/or environmental factors are acting in a complex way.

### Mendelian disorders of high-density lipoprotein metabolism [^115aYq7s]. Circulation Research (2014). Low credibility.

High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) are a highly heterogeneous and dynamic group of the smallest and densest lipoproteins present in the circulation. This review provides the current molecular insight into HDL metabolism led by articles describing mutations in genes that have a large affect on HDL cholesterol levels through their roles in HDL and triglyceride metabolism. Using this information from both human and animal studies, it is discussed how HDL is produced, remodeled in the circulation, affected by factors that control the metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, how it helps maintain cellular cholesterol homeostasis, and, finally, how it is catabolized. It can be concluded that HDL cholesterol as a trait is genetically heterogeneous, with as many as 40 genes involved. In most cases, only heterozygotes of gene variants are known, and HDL cholesterol as a trait is inherited in an autosomal-dominant manner. Only 3 Mendelian disorders of HDL metabolism are currently known, which are inherited in an autosomal-recessive mode.

### Measuring intolerance to mutation in human genetics [^115UJxKG]. Nature Genetics (2019). High credibility.

In numerous applications, from working with animal models to mapping the genetic basis of human disease susceptibility, knowing whether a single disrupting mutation in a gene is likely to be deleterious is useful. With this goal in mind, a number of measures have been developed to identify genes in which protein-truncating variants (PTVs), or other types of mutations, are absent or kept at very low frequency in large population samples-genes that appear 'intolerant' to mutation. One measure in particular, the probability of being loss-of-function intolerant (pLI), has been widely adopted. This measure was designed to classify genes into three categories, null, recessive and haploinsufficient, on the basis of the contrast between observed and expected numbers of PTVs. Such population-genetic approaches can be useful in many applications. As we clarify, however, they reflect the strength of selection acting on heterozygotes and not dominance or haploinsufficiency.

### The effects of quantitative trait architecture on detection power in short-term artificial selection experiments [^113eQSTi]. G3 (2020). Medium credibility.

In another example, running the selection experiment for an additional five generations can significantly improve detection power at higher false positive rate in our standard model with 10 QTL, since many QTL are still segregating at intermediate frequency after just four generations of selection. However, the gain in power will be minimal if derived alleles are either dominant or recessive, because during the additional generations, selection would become less effective in the dominant case, while most of the genetic variance will already have been depleted in the recessive case (Figure 9).

Figure 9
The choice of optimal experimental design depends on the underlying trait architecture. Extending the selection experiment from four to nine generations substantially increases detection power at higher false positive rates when the effect of derived allele is (A) additive, but such effect is minimal when the derived allele is either (B) completely dominant or (C) completely recessive. Models with 10 QTL are used. Additive: heterozygotes express intermediate phenotype. Dominant: heterozygotes express the same phenotype as derived homozygotes. Recessive: heterozygotes express the same phenotype as ancestral homozygotes. Solid vs. dotted lines: see Figure 2 caption.

Since the parameter space of our model is vast, the idealized scenarios presented in this paper can only cover a tiny proportion of what is actually possible. To allow researchers to study alternative models, we provide a flexible simulation framework that is highly customizable with regard to trait architecture, experimental design, and parameters of the genomic background (described in the Supplementary Materials). When some information on the expected trait architecture is available, different experimental designs can be simulated to find the optimal setup for the given architecture. Without such a priori information, a range of architectures may need to be simulated to obtain a general sense of the range of power that could be achieved and what types of architectures are likely to be detectable under different experimental designs.

While several specialized tools have already been designed for such applications, we believe that our approach provides key advantages by implementing its simulations in the flexible SLiM framework, one of the most widely used and well-tested frameworks for forward genetic simulation to date. SLiM simulations are fully scriptable, allowing the user to model a wide range of evolutionary scenarios that can include high levels of genetic and ecological realism, while the underlying simulation engine has been highly optimized over the years. All SLiM configuration scripts developed in this study are provided in the Supplementary Materials, together with a comprehensive user-guide explaining how these scripts may be adjusted for custom scenarios.

### Evolution of dominance mechanisms at a butterfly mimicry supergene [^116DYPZn]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Dominance describes how the phenotype of heterozygous genotypes at a locus is determined by the relative expression of each allele. The mechanisms underlying variation in dominance have been strongly debated. Dominance differences are often the direct effects of expression or activity levels of alleles, with dominant alleles being active and recessive ones having low expression or activity. However, dominance variations are sometimes controlled by dominance modifiers such as trans -acting factors. Dominance may respond to selection for traits showing high levels of local polymorphism, where a large proportion of individuals can be heterozygous. Selection on dominance is also important during the spread of new alleles, which initially occur mostly at heterozygous state. This effect, called, 'Haldane's sieve', predicts that positive selection is more efficient when the new adaptive allele is dominant.

Loci showing adaptive polymorphism for complex traits are sometimes organized into supergenes with several tightly linked genessuch as the locus controlling Batesian mimicry in butterflies, the 'social supergene' in fire antsor the supergene controlling plumage and behavioural variation in the white-throated sparrow. Recombination suppression in supergenes means that supergene alleles segregate as for a single Mendelian locus, composed of several component genes controlling different co-adapted characters. However, both the genetic and evolutionary mechanisms by which dominance can be coordinated in such polygenic architectures remain unclear.

### Patterns of X-linked inheritance: a new approach for the genome era [^112hJQ3b]. Genetics in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The concepts of X-linked (XL) dominant and recessive inheritance originated long before dosage compensation for X chromosome genes was understood, but now have no scientific basis. However, misunderstanding of the underlying biology persists, prompting our reassessment of XL inheritance.

Methods

We reviewed data on penetrance, expressivity, and X chromosome inactivation (XCI) for 55 XL genes and 57 XL disorders, and examined variations in inheritance based on disease severity, XCI status, cell selection, and other factors.

Results

Our analysis demonstrated widely varying penetrance among heterozygous females that was related to severity of the phenotype particularly in males, the degree of cell selection shown by XCI patterns, cell autonomous or non-cell autonomous function of the gene product, and rare cellular interference.

Conclusion

The conventional classification of XL inheritance into dominant and recessive subtypes is biologically flawed and should be retired. A more nuanced framework for understanding XL disorders is needed that accounts for the underlying biological complexity, and we propose 4 new groups of XL disorders with different patterns that should improve genetic diagnosis and counseling in families with XL disorders.

### Prevalence of loss-of-function, gain-of-function and dominant-negative mechanisms across genetic disease phenotypes [^113AzjVv]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In many mixed-inheritance genes, the distinction between dominant and recessive modes of action is clear: missense DN variants in ITPR1 are associated with Gillespie syndrome, whereas only recessive null variants have been linked to a clinically identical phenotype. In other cases, however, the distinction is less straightforward. Both recessive and dominant missense mutations in IGF1R cause resistance to insulin-like growth factor 1, manifesting in intrauterine growth retardation; for example, the recessive p. Arg40Leuand the dominant p. Val629Glu. Several genetic factors can explain this, e.g. hypomorphic homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations (recessive partial LOF) that produce phenotypes indistinguishable from those caused by haploinsufficiency (dominant complete LOF). Another factor may be incomplete penetrance –, which causes variable phenotype expressivity within ancestries, sexes, and even families. For example, the presence of common variants may modify the penetrance of inherited rare variants, lowering the liability threshold required for being affected by a disease. Alternatively, DN variants might present as perfect phenocopies of the recessive disorder. In some possibly rare cases, a single variant could result in biallelic LOF while exhibiting a DN effect in the heterozygous state, as suggested by emerging evidence in AARS1.

Considering exclusively dominant genes, diverse genetic and mechanistic factors can explain the coexistence of haploinsufficient and DN phenotypes in the same. For example, allele-specific expression and sex differences in SMC1A lead to distinct phenotypes, with truncating mutations linked to haploinsufficiency causing a seizure disorder and DN missense mutations resulting in Cornelia de Lange syndrome. Notably, mutant SMC1A proteins maintain a residual function in males but confer a DN effect in females. A similar phenomenon occurs in NF1, where truncating mutations reduce protein levels via haploinsufficiency, while destabilising missense mutations induce a DN effect by promoting degradation of the wild type in a tissue-specific pattern. Although such contrasting mechanisms are scarcer among phenotypes induced only by missense mutations, these examples highlight the nuanced relationship between mutation type, biological context, and the resulting phenotype, complicating the interpretation of molecular mechanisms.

### Exploring the unique characteristics of genes with dual autosomal dominant and recessive inheritance: mechanisms, phenotypes and candidate identification [^113pzF4T]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Autosomal dominant (AD) inheritance often arises through haploinsufficiency, dominant-negative or gain of function (GoF) effects, while autosomal recessive (AR) inheritance generally results from partial or complete loss of function (LoF). Yet, a subset of genes demonstrates both inheritance patterns. We aimed to curate a list of such 'AD/AR' genes and to propose additional candidates.

Methods

AD/AR genes were subcategorised based on genotype-phenotype correlations and disease mechanisms. Using bioinformatic analyses, we compared genes with AD, AR and AD/AR inheritance across various metrics, including gnomAD constraint values, exon count, protein length, quaternary structure and gene ontology terms. A machine learning-based metric was used to account for interdependence among features.

Results

Pathogenic variants in AD/AR genes can lead to distinct or similar phenotypes, depending on the molecular mechanism. AD/AR genes exhibit unique bioinformatic properties such as intermediate constraint scores, a combination of gene ontology terms, a greater average number of exons and an elevated propensity to form homomeric/heteromeric proteins. We identified homozygous LoF or clinically reported variants in nine genes previously classified as AD only.

Conclusion

Collectively, the data suggest that AD/AR genes possess distinctive features that likely underpin their dual inheritance modes. We propose nine candidate AD/AR genes and emphasise caution in filtering by inheritance type alone.

### An optimal dose-effect mode trend test for SNP genotype tables [^117DcFL1]. Genetic Epidemiology (2009). Low credibility.

The genome-wide association studies have improved our understanding of the genetic basis of many complex traits. Two-by-three contingency tables are tested in these studies. The trend test for the additive mode is most often used, which is the test of 1 degree of freedom (df = 1) and other tests, such as the genotype test (chi(2) (df = 2)) and the chi(2) (df = 1) tests for the dominant and recessive modes are also used to increase the power for markers in the non-additive modes. However, any one of them or combination of them is not perfect. We describe the relations among the chi(2) (df = 2) test and chi(2) (df = 1) tests for the dominant and recessive modes and the trend test for the additive mode and propose a new statistic based on their relations that tests the hypothesis that the disease-susceptible allele has a dose-effect somewhere between the recessive and dominant modes, which corresponds to the optimal dose-effect for the observed data.

### The impact of non-additive effects on the genetic correlation between populations [^113nQz7L]. G3 (2020). Medium credibility.

Average effects of alleles can show considerable differences between populations. The magnitude of these differences can be measured by the additive genetic correlation between populations ([Formula: see text]). This [Formula: see text] can be lower than one due to the presence of non-additive genetic effects together with differences in allele frequencies between populations. However, the relationship between the nature of non-additive effects, differences in allele frequencies, and the value of [Formula: see text] remains unclear, and was therefore the focus of this study. We simulated genotype data of two populations that have diverged under drift only, or under drift and selection, and we simulated traits where the genetic model and magnitude of non-additive effects were varied. Results showed that larger differences in allele frequencies and larger non-additive effects resulted in lower values of [Formula: see text] In addition, we found that with epistasis, [Formula: see text] decreases with an increase of the number of interactions per locus. For both dominance and epistasis, we found that, when non-additive effects became extremely large, [Formula: see text] had a lower bound that was determined by the type of inter-allelic interaction, and the difference in allele frequencies between populations. Given that dominance variance is usually small, our results show that it is unlikely that true [Formula: see text] values lower than 0.80 are due to dominance effects alone. With realistic levels of epistasis, [Formula: see text] dropped as low as 0.45. These results may contribute to the understanding of differences in genetic expression of complex traits between populations, and may help in explaining the inefficiency of genomic trait prediction across populations.

### A unified framework for transmission-disequilibrium test analysis of discrete and continuous traits [^117TmMmL]. Genetic Epidemiology (2002). Low credibility.

This paper presents a unified framework for transmission-disequilibrium tests for discrete and continuous traits. A conditional score test is derived that maximizes power to detect small effects for any exponential family distribution, which includes binary and normal distributions, and distributions that are skewed or have non-normal kurtosis. The specific distributional form need not be specified, and the method applies to sibships of arbitrary size. Formulas for the distribution of the test statistic are given for models including complex genetic effects (additive, dominant, and recessive gene action), covariates, multiple gene models including gene-gene interactions or heterogeneity, and gene-environment interactions. We develop refinements of our method for trait-based sampling designs and multiple siblings that can have dramatic effects on power.

### Dominance in mitochondrial disorders [^112npxRw]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2005). Low credibility.

Dominant traits are rare in mitochondrial disorders but include important nosological entities such as alterations of organellar biogenesis and abnormalities in the structural integrity of the mitochondrial genome, determined by mutations in genes involved in its maintenance and propagation. Both haplo-insufficiency and 'gain-of-function' mechanisms underlie the pathogenesis of these disorders. Impairment in energy supply, abnormal mitochondrial trafficking, increased toxic damage by oxygen radicals, and mitochondrially driven apoptosis have been documented in different dominant syndromes. In addition, maternally inherited mutations of mitochondrial DNA can sometimes simulate dominant traits, mainly because of reduced penetrance and complex interaction with genetic and environmental factors.

### A powerful method to test associations between ordinal traits and genotypes [^113sPaWB]. G3 (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Simulation results

In this subsection, we present a series of simulation studies to investigate the performance of our proposed latent variable model (abbreviated as lvm), and compare it with the probit and logit models, which both regressing an ordinal phenotype on a genotype. We compared these under multiple simulation scenarios, so that different modeling assumptions would be favored. Two types of data generation mechanism were considered throughout our simulation studies: (i) generating data from a multivariate normal random variable (named the ND mechanism) and (ii) generating data under the proportional odds model (named the PO mechanism). In addition, three genetic models (co-dominant, dominant, and recessive models) were considered.

The specifics of our simulation data generation scenarios are as follows. For simplicity, the dimension of the covariateis one, and the number of levels for a phenotype Y is set to five. Under the ND mechanism, the three-dimensional latent variablewas generated from a multivariate normal distribution, with the genotype G being a manifestation of, the ordinal phenotype Y being a manifestation of, and the covariatebeing equal to. Each marginal distribution offollowed a standard normal distribution. Note that the distribution of G varied according to the type of the true genetic model. Let A (major allele) and a (minor allele) denote two alleles at the single biallelic locus corresponding to the genotype G. Under the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) conditions, the expected genotype frequencies of G being, andwould be, and, respectively, with the minor allele frequency (MAF) p taking on values from. If the HWE assumption did not hold, we directly set three kinds of multinomial distribution (P) for with different parameter structures,… When a co-dominant model was assumed, the three genotypes, andwere coded as 0, 1, and 2, respectively. In a model where a dominant effect was assumed, the genotypewas coded as 0 while bothandwere coded as 1. Accordingly, scores of 0 for bothandand 1 forwere employed in a recessive model. In addition, under each genetic model the probabilities of Y being, and 5 were always, and 0.05, respectively. We set the covariance matrixofasto investigate the Type I error rate, and letbeto compare the statistical power under different alternatives, depending on the parameter θ, whose range was the set.

### Selective sweeps under dominance and inbreeding [^111TBHEm]. G3 (2020). Medium credibility.

We have also investigated how dominance affects soft sweep signatures, since previous analyses have only focused on how dominance affects hard sweeps. In outcrossing organisms, recessive mutations leave weaker sweep signatures than additive or dominant mutations as they spend more time at low frequencies, increasing the amount of recombination that restores neutral variation (Figures 3, 4). With increased self-fertilization, dominance has a weaker impact on sweep signatures as most mutations are homozygous (Figure 4). We also show that the SFS for recessive alleles can resemble a soft sweep, with a higher number of intermediate-frequency variants than for other hard sweeps (Figure 5). Dominance only weakly affects sweeps from standing variation, as trajectories of beneficial alleles become similar once the variant's initial frequency exceeds(Figures 3, 4). Yet different dominance levels can affect sweep signatures if the beneficial allele is reintroduced by recurrent mutation (Figure 6). Hence if one wishes to understand how dominance affects sweep signatures, it is also important to consider which processes underlie observed patterns of genetic diversity.

These results also demonstrate that the effects of dominance on sweeps are not necessarily intuitive. For example, both highly dominant and recessive mutations have elongated fixation times compared to co–dominant mutations. Based on this intuition, one could expect both dominant and recessive mutations to both produce weaker sweep signatures than co-dominant ones. In practice, dominant mutations have similar sweep signatures to co–dominant mutations (Figures 3, 5), and recessive sweeps could produce similar signatures as sweeps from standing variation (Figure 5). Dominance also has a weaker impact on sweeps from standing variation (Figures 3, 5).

### Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^112HBCjH]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is the most prevalent, potentially lethal, monogenic disorder. It is associated with large interfamilial and intrafamilial variability, which can be explained to a large extent by its genetic heterogeneity and modifier genes. An increased understanding of the disorder's underlying genetic, molecular, and cellular mechanisms and a better appreciation of its progression and systemic manifestations have laid out the foundation for the development of clinical trials and potentially effective treatments.

### Evolution of dominance mechanisms at a butterfly mimicry supergene [^111eP1kj]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Dominance and colour hierarchy

Dominance heat maps were generated for each heterozygous genotype to visualize how dominance varies across the wing. For each pair of supergene alleles, heat maps represent, on a pixel-by-pixel basis, the proportion of heterozygous individuals for which the colour was identical to one, both or neither homozygote.

To visualize the consistency of the model of colour hierarchy across the wing, we constructed wing maps reporting the colour expressed by heterozygotes when the corresponding homozygotes show distinct colours. Maps were not constructed for a pair of alleles, but for a pair of colours. For each pair of colours, at a given pixel position, we considered all pairs of supergene alleles showing the colour difference between the modal wing patterns of homozygotes, and computed the proportion of heterozygous individuals expressing each colour. The map obtained, termed a 'colour hierarchy map', translates these proportions into gradients of black, orange and yellow, visually showing the consistency of the hierarchy across the wings.

To estimate the dominance of one colour to another colour, we computed the probability of expressing the dominant or the recessive colour in heterozygotes throughout all selected pixels for all genotypes. Here the expression of one colour was defined as its probability of being expressed in heterozygotes. Finally, we estimated the proportion of the phenotype of heterozygotes explained by colour hierarchy by computing the overall proportion of pixels conforming to the general hierarchy across the three colours.

### A constrained-likelihood approach to marker-trait association studies [^113uJ4BB]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2005). Low credibility.

Marker-trait association analysis is an important statistical tool for detecting DNA variants responsible for genetic traits. In such analyses, an analysis model of the mean genetic effects of the genotypes is often specified. For instance, the effect of the disease allele on the trait is often specified to be dominant, recessive, additive, or multiplicative. Although this model-based approach is powerful when the analysis model is correctly specified, it has been found to have low power sometimes when the specified model is incorrect. We introduce an approach that does not require the specification of a particular genetic model. This approach is built upon a constrained maximum likelihood in which the mean genetic effect of the heterozygous genotype is required to not exceed those of the two homozygous genotypes. The asymptotic distribution of the likelihood-ratio statistic is derived for two special cases. A simulation study suggests that this new approach has power comparable to that of the model-based method when the analysis model is correctly specified. This approach uses one marker at a time (i.e., it is a single-marker analysis). However, given the latest findings that powerful inferential procedures for haplotype analyses can be constructed from single-marker analyses, we expect this approach to be useful for haplotype analyses.

### HRS / EHRA expert consensus statement on the state of genetic testing for the channelopathies and cardiomyopathies this document was developed as a partnership between the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) and the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) [^1134MDTx]. Heart Rhythm (2011). Medium credibility.

Appendix 1 glossary — key genetic testing terms are defined for clinical use: Autosomal dominant is the situation in which the disease can be expressed even when just one chromosome harbors the mutation, whereas autosomal recessive is expression only when both chromosomes of a pair are abnormal. Cascade testing is a procedure whereby all first-degree relatives of a genotype-positive index case are tested in concentric circles of relatedness, and if one relative is genotype positive, all his/her first-degree relatives should be tested continuing this process. Copy number variation (CNV) is when the number of copies of a gene or other DNA sequence differs between individuals. Expressivity is the level of expression of the phenotype, and variable expressivity occurs when manifestations differ among individuals with the same genotype. Penetrance is the likelihood that a gene mutation will have any expression at all, and if the frequency of expression is less than 100%, the defect is associated with reduced or incomplete penetrance. A first-degree relative is a blood relative who is a person's parent, sibling, or child; a founder mutation is the occurrence of a particular gene mutation at increased frequencies within a population due to a small ancestral group; the index case/proband is the person who first draws clinical attention in a family. Germline mutation denotes a heritable change incorporated into every cell in the body, whereas somatic mutations occur in cells other than gametes and cannot be transmitted to offspring.

### Hybrid adaptation is hampered by haldane's sieve [^114v8Tzp]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The challenge of attaining homozygosity accounts for the reduced adaptive potential of hybrids

The likelihood and rate of a mutation becoming fixed in a population is shaped by the architecture of the trait under selection, including allelic dominance, and the strength of selection. Therefore, not only does an adaptive mutation need to occur, but it also needs to be in a proper genotype for the individuals to fully benefit from it. Dominant mutations are more likely to become fixed than recessive ones, a principle referred to as Haldane's sieve –. This poses a problem to non-obligate sexual species and in systems that only rarely reproduce sexually, like many unicellular microbes such as fungi. In asexual populations, recessive or incompletely dominant beneficial mutations can bypass Haldane's sieve by achieving homozygosity through LOH, although completely recessive alleles would be invisible to selection and could thus be lost before an LOH occurs. The rate of LOH is not uniform among genotypes, and it has been shown to be lower in heterozygous ones. In hybrids, which are highly heterozygous, LOH rates are even more limited (Fig. 4a). Once a beneficial mutation occurs in the parental genomes, high rates of mitotic recombination can rapidly lead to LOH at the site where the mutation occurred and make a mutation homozygous. This would occur at a lower rate in hybrids, slowing down the rate of adaptation.

### A polygenic score method boosted by non-additive models [^116v7PxH]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Predicting heritable traits and genetic liability of disease from individuals' genomes has important implications for tailoring medical prevention and intervention strategies in precision medicine. Polygenic score (PGS), a statistical approach, has recently attracted substantial attention due to its potential relevance in clinical practice –. To estimate genetic predisposition, PGS aggregates the effects of multiple genetic variants into a single score for each individual. Most existing PGS approaches benefit from the increased sample size in modern genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Specifically, summary-statistics-based approaches take GWAS-based univariate effect size estimates of additive effects and ancestry-matched linkage-disequilibrium (LD) reference panels as input to construct multivariate predictive models, as implemented, for example, in clumping and thresholding (C + T, also known as pruning and thresholding), LDpred, lassosum, PRS-CS, and SBayesR.

Genetic dominance is well-documented in the classical genetics literature. It refers to any deviation from additive effects of allelic dosage of a genetic variant on a trait and consists of dominant, recessive, over-dominant, and over-recessive effects. Each non-additive effect differs by the relationship among the estimated effect sizes for heterozygous or homozygous genotypes (Supplementary Methods). Earlier studies focused on a smaller number of samples and estimated that the relative contribution of non-additive effects on trait heritability is smaller than that of additive effects. However, the increase in sample sizes in recent studies coupled with methodological advancements started to demonstrate the presence of non-additive heritability, and their relative contribution varies depending on the genetic architecture of traits –. For example, some highlight substantial roles of non-additive effects in autoimmune diseases, most notably in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, suggesting the potential benefits of considering non-additive effects in polygenic score modeling for some traits. Indeed, several case studies have already started to explore PGS, focusing on non-additive effects. For example, a recent study reported that replacing additive GWAS p -values with recessive GWAS p -values in C + T PGS modeling improves predictive performance for aggressive behavior. However, the advantage of incorporating non-additive genetic dominance effects in PGS modeling across a wide range of traits is largely unknown, partly because most existing PGS approaches are limited and consider only linear additive effects, given their dependencies on the GWAS summary statistics characterized by additive association tests.

### A novel electronic assessment strategy to support applied drosophila genetics training in university courses [^112MYex9]. G3 (2015). Low credibility.

Questions 13−16 cover a second crossing task that involves recombination of two gene loci with dominant traits, including a-marked P element. It tests applied understanding of recombination and relationships between dominant and recessive traits. Question 13 (multiple choice) assesses the student mating scheme by asking about the gender choices of the first cross. This question can only be correctly answered if the task was solved on paper, because the students need to have understood thatmutant females need to be chosen to provide the right genetic background for the selection of recombinants at the F2 stage. Question 14 (multiple answer) provides the answer to question 13 helping students to correct their paper-based mating scheme if needed, and asks to select the correct F1 animals from four fly pictograms of male and female flies carrying different marker combinations (Figure 1C). This requires the ability to translate from genotype to phenotype and select gender. Question 15 (multiple answer) is a novel type of question which asks for phenotypic selection criteria. This tests the students' understanding of how recombination is applied, of Mendelian assortment, and of dominant/recessive trait relationships. Question 16 (multiple choice) provides the F1 cross and asks questions about the F2 offspring, querying basic knowledge of recombination rules and quantitative aspects of Mendelian inheritance. Especially the last question illustrates that any kind of knowledge can be assessed at almost every stage of the assessment, providing versatile possibilities for e-assessment design.

Taken together, our hybrid e-assessment strategy provides unique means to assess a range of skills important for mating scheme design, and we feel that the aforementioned examples cover only part of the possible types of questions.

### Widespread recessive effects on common diseases in a cohort of 44, 000 British Pakistanis and Bangladeshis with high autozygosity [^111HQxzc]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Quantifying novelty in the recessive findings

For the 185 recessive loci reported, we next systematically searched for associations between the lead variant and the same or related trait in the literature. In an effort to quantify the novelty in our findings, we developed a "literature evidence score" to characterize the strength of the literature support for each finding (the higher the score, the stronger the evidence). The details of the approach are described in Note S10. In summary, ∼40%–80% of our reported associations are novel, depending on whether a strict (no reported association to a related trait) or lenient (no reported association to the same trait) definition of novelty is used. We found that the strength of the support in the literature was associated with a smaller difference in the recessive and additive p values for the test (linear regression of delta log10 p against our literature evidence score; slope: −0.32, p = 5.4 × 10 −5; Figure S18) — in other words, associations that seem more likely to be truly recessive are less likely to have support already in the literature. This reiterates the importance of performing recessive testing on top of just additive testing and in cohorts with better power for the recessive tests, as these findings would potentially have been missed from additive testing alone.

### What's in a name? Issues to consider when naming mendelian disorders [^111WLQGx]. Genetics in Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Genetic heterogeneity, which refers to more than one gene causing a particular phenotype, is also common and would complicate naming genetic disorders after genes. For example, Weill–Marchesani syndrome is caused by pathogenic variants in any of four different genes and is inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner depending on the gene. While it may be critical to know the specific genetic defect for a particular phenotype, it is equally important to group similar phenotypes together in a phenotypic series. Phenotypic series, created when several phenotype entries are similar in their clinical manifestations, are generated to allow viewing of the genetic heterogeneity of phenotypes. Another example, long QT syndrome, may be caused by pathogenic variants in 15 different genes, but it is still essential for patients to be seen in a clinic with expertise in cardiac rhythm disorders to ensure proper diagnosis and treatment.

Finally, gene names are often cumbersome and less meaningful, making them difficult to remember. For example, one type of retinitis pigmentosa (retinitis pigmentosa 10) (MIM 180105) is caused by pathogenic variants in the IMPDH1 (or inosine-5-prime-monophosphate dehydrogenase, type I) gene (MIM 146690). This name provides little information to patients, their families, or their health-care providers and would be challenging to remember. One could argue that remembering which of the 88 types of retinitis pigmentosa the patient has (named retinitis pigmentosa 1-retinitis pigmentosa-88 in our scheme) would also be difficult. However, including the name of the phenotype allows for health-care providers to recognize the disorder as a progressive eye disease.

### On penetrance estimation in family, clinical, and population cohorts [^114R41xz]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In recent years, there has been a considerable influx of publications assessing the penetrance of pathogenic variants associated with monogenic diseases with dominant inheritance. As large and diverse groups have been sequenced, it has become clear that incomplete penetrance is common to most hereditary diseases, as numerous molecular, genetic, or environmental factors can cause clinical diversity among the carriers of the same variant. In this review, we discuss some of these factors and focus on the existing approaches to estimating penetrance, depending on the data available and their application to different data sets. We also list some currently available large-scale data sets with penetrance estimates.

### A modern approach to dyslipidemia [^116UFdX3]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Table 4 shows a classification of 18 syndromic lipid disorders that result from rare pathogenic variants in 23 different genes. Some disorders result from variants in more than 1 gene, whereas in other cases different rare variants in the same gene cause different diseases. The monogenic disorders in Table 4 show classical Mendelian segregation patterns, usually autosomal recessive, in which both copies of the gene harbor pathogenic variants (ie, biallelic), which can be identical (ie, simple homozygote) or different (ie, compound heterozygote). The defining feature of a true recessive trait is that monoallelic individuals (ie, obligate heterozygotes for the pathogenic variant such as parents) show no detectable phenotype either clinically or biochemically and are referred to as "carriers".

However, in one-third of monogenic dyslipidemias, an additive effect of pathogenic variants is observed clinically. In these conditions, of which FH is the most familiar example, individuals with a single monoallelic variant (ie, heterozygotes) have a less severe phenotype than individuals with biallelic variants. In the past, this additive effect was described using the term "codominant" inheritance, but now the newer term "semidominant" or "incomplete dominant" has been proposed for FH. In semidominant inheritance, heterozygotes display an abnormal biochemical phenotype sometimes with characteristic clinical features (Table 5). In individuals with biallelic mutations (ie, FH "homozygotes"), the LDL-C deviation is more extreme and clinical features typically become apparent at a young age. Because most practitioners will never encounter a case of ultrarare biallelic FH, but do commonly encounter monoallelic FH, FH reduces to apparently autosomal dominant genetics, an approximation that works well for all practical purposes.

### Joint analysis of phenotype-effect-generation identifies loci associated with grain quality traits in rice hybrids [^115hHKj7]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

In breeding programs, the selection of parental inbred lines for the development of superior hybrids is challenging. Genetic dissection of hybrids is more difficult than for inbred lines, as nonadditive genetic effects such as dominance are involved in addition to additive genetic effects. Furthermore, the joint analysis of these genetic effects requires the integration of both inbred and hybrid populations. In many analyses, heterosis is estimated as the difference between the hybrid and mid-parent values from parent–child trios to map loci associated with dominant effects. The dominant effects should be treated in both directions according to the reference allele. For example, heterozygous genotypes are coded to be homozygous genotypes of the reference allele in the dominant model and homozygous genotypes of the alternative allele in the recessive model.

Joint additive and dominant effect models have demonstrated superiority over models with separate effects. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 130,725 cattle using a joint additive and nonadditive model identified six dominant loci with impacts exceeding the largest effect variant identified by the corresponding additive effect model. When both hybrid and inbred parent populations are available, the differences and similarities among parental inbred phenotypes, hybrid phenotypes, general combining ability, and hybrid heterosis can be used to infer genetic effects. In maize, 1428 maternal inbred varieties were crossed with 30 paternal inbred varieties to generate 42,840 (1428 × 30) hybrids. There were 166 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) identified for three agronomic traits: days to tasselling, plant height, and ear weight. These QTLs were categorized into three classes (additive, dominant, or epistatic effects)using comparisons to models with a single effect in a single population. Ideally, both additive and dominant genetic effects should be analysed simultaneously with both parental inbred and hybrid populations to maximize statistical power.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to genetic testing, KDIGO 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that some proven and suspected ADPKD genes are associated with recessive disorders, which is significant for variant carriers. Counsel patients with a detected pathogenic variant about the risk, and offer carrier testing to partners if they are considering having a family.

### 1 in 38 individuals at risk of a dominant medically actionable disease [^1179E9FD]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical genomic sequencing can identify pathogenic variants unrelated to the initial clinical question, but of medical relevance to the patients and their families. With ongoing discussions on the utility of disclosing or searching for such variants, it is of crucial importance to obtain unbiased insight in the prevalence of these incidental or secondary findings, in order to better weigh potential risks and benefits. Previous studies have reported a broad range of secondary findings ranging from 1 to 9%, merely attributable to differences in study design, cohorts tested, sequence technology used and genes analyzed. Here, we analyzed WES data of 1640 anonymized healthy Dutch individuals to establish the frequency of medically actionable disease alleles in an outbred population of European descent. Our study shows that 1 in 38 healthy individuals (2.7%) has a (likely) pathogenic variant in one of 59 medically actionable dominant disease genes for which the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) recommends disclosure. Additionally, we identified 36 individuals (2.2%) to be a carrier of a recessive pathogenic disease allele. Whereas these frequencies of secondary findings are in line with what has been reported in the East-Asian population, the pathogenic variants are differently distributed across the 59 ACMG genes. Our results contribute to the debate on genetic risk factor screening in healthy individuals and the discussion whether the potential benefits of this knowledge and related preventive options, outweigh the risk of the emotional impact of the test result and possible stigmatization.

### Biallelic variants in genes previously associated with dominant inheritance: CACNA1A, RET and SLC20A2 [^111neDcA]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

A subset of families with co-dominant or recessive inheritance has been described in several genes previously associated with dominant inheritance. Those recessive families displayed similar, more severe, or even completely different phenotypes to their dominant counterparts. We report the first patients harboring homozygous disease-related variants in three genes that were previously associated with dominant inheritance: a loss-of-function variant in the CACNA1A gene and two missense variants in the RET and SLC20A2 genes, respectively. All patients presented with a more severe clinical phenotype than the corresponding typical dominant form. We suggest that co-dominant or recessive inheritance for these three genes could explain the phenotypic differences from those documented in their cognate dominant phenotypes. Our results reinforce that geneticists should be aware of the possible different forms of inheritance in genes when WES variant interpretation is performed. We also evidence the need to refine phenotypes and inheritance patterns associated with genes in order to avoid failures during WES analysis and thus, raising the WES diagnostic capacity in the benefit of patients.

### The X factor: a robust and powerful approach to X-chromosome-inclusive whole-genome association studies [^11797Zp4]. Genetic Epidemiology (2021). Medium credibility.

A bi‐allelic SNP has two alleles, and, of which one is the reference allele and the other is the alternative allele with allele frequency. An autosomal SNP has three genotypes regardless of sex, namely. In association analysis of an autosomal SNP, the common practice is to simply model a binary or continuous phenotypeas an additive function of the number of copies of the non‐baseline allele present in; that is, codingadditively as. Here, without loss of generality, is chosen to be the baseline allele in a statistical model andthe non‐baseline allele. Whenis binary, this regression‐based additive test is also equivalent to the Cochran–Armitage trend test (Wellek & Ziegler). Although both dominant and recessive genetic models of inheritance are possible, among these one degrees of freedom (1 df) models, a common practice for GWAS is to use the additive model, because it has reasonable power to detect both additive and dominance effects at a causal variant, and at variants in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the causal variant (Bush & Moore; Hill et al.). An alternative parameterization is the 2 df genotypic model that includes both the additiveterm and the dominanceterm. In the case of recessive genetic inheritance, Zhou et al. showed that the 2 df genotypic test outperforms the 1 df additive test for binary outcomes, and Dizier et al. reached the same conclusion for continuous traits. In the case of additive genetic inheritance being true, the genotypic test is known to be less powerful than the additive test due to the increased df, which is unnecessary. The preferred test for unknown genetic inheritance in terms of power and robustness to different genetic models is, however, not clear across different true genetic effect sizes, sample sizes, and significance levels.

### A novel application of data-consistent inversion to overcome spurious inference in genome-wide association studies [^114VQkeZ]. Genetic Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The genome-wide association studies (GWAS) typically use linear or logistic regression models to identify associations between phenotypes (traits) and genotypes (genetic variants) of interest. However, the use of regression with the additive assumption has potential limitations. First, the normality assumption of residuals is the one that is rarely seen in practice, and deviation from normality increases the Type-I error rate. Second, building a model based on such an assumption ignores genetic structures, like, dominant, recessive, and protective-risk cases. Ignoring genetic variants may result in spurious conclusions about the associations between a variant and a trait. We propose an assumption-free model built upon data-consistent inversion (DCI), which is a recently developed measure-theoretic framework utilized for uncertainty quantification. This proposed DCI-derived model builds a nonparametric distribution on model inputs that propagates to the distribution of observed data without the required normality assumption of residuals in the regression model. This characteristic enables the proposed DCI-derived model to cover all genetic variants without emphasizing on additivity of the classic-GWAS model. Simulations and a replication GWAS with data from the COPDGene demonstrate the ability of this model to control the Type-I error rate at least as well as the classic-GWAS (additive linear model) approach while having similar or greater power to discover variants in different genetic modes of transmission.

### Segregation analysis of asthma and respiratory allergy in population-based samples of families [^114MDtKP]. Genetic Epidemiology (2001). Low credibility.

Class A regressive multiple logistic segregation models with a sibling covariate were used to investigate the underlying determinants of asthma and respiratory allergy (defined from specific IgE levels to inhaled allergens) in the randomly recruited Caucasian families from the Genetic Analysis Workshop 12 asthma data sets — Perth, Busselton, and Southampton. For asthma, both a purely multifactorial model and a major gene (dominant or recessive) model with multifactorial effects fitted the data. For respiratory allergy, a dominant, dominant with multifactorial effects and a purely multifactorial model all fitted the data. However, homogeneity of the three studies was rejected for both traits indicating that the three populations are significantly different and should be analyzed separately. This finding has implications for the meta-analysis of asthma linkage studies.

### Evolution of dominance mechanisms at a butterfly mimicry supergene [^116JSfJ4]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

By contrast, ancestral alleles (illustris or silvana, ancestral gene order) were fully recessive to derived alleles in all combinations tested, and independently of the colours displayed by the corresponding phenotypes. The dominance in such combinations is coordinated throughout the wing in favour of the derived allele, irrespective of the colours involved, and did not follow the hierarchy in colour expression inferred for alleles from the derived class. Across all derived/ancestral heterozygotes (that is, carrying an illustris or silvana allele), only 63% of colour expression followed the colour hierarchy. Permutation tests showed that the percentage of heterozygote phenotypes explained by colour hierarchy in derived/derived heterozygotes is significantly higher than in derived/ancestral heterozygotes (P = 0.025; see Supplementary Methods). Moreover, derived/ancestral heterozygotes phenotypes were significantly better predicted by assuming the complete dominance of one allele, independently of colours than derived/derived heterozygotes phenotypes (nested ANOVA, N = 472, F 1,471 = 48.89; P < 0.0001; see Supplementary Fig. 2). The difference mainly stems from the recessivity of the black colour of silvana and illustris to the yellow and orange colours controlled by alleles carried by the derived chromosome arrangement (see Supplementary Fig. 3). In heterozygotes between either silvana or illustris and a derived allele, the proportion of pixels where black was recessive to yellow was 37%, much higher than in heterozygotes for two derived alleles (4%). For black/orange relationships, the difference was twofold (43 and 22%, respectively). Overall, this supports the hypothesis that two distinct mechanisms of dominance determine the phenotype of heterozygotes, that is, (1) a hierarchy in colour expression within alleles from the derived class and (2) a complete dominance, independent of colour, associated with the 400-kb inversion.

### Haploinsufficiency, dominant negative, and gain-of-function mechanisms in epilepsy: matching therapeutic approach to the pathophysiology [^115hjHPk]. Neurotherapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

This review summarizes the pathogenic mechanisms that underpin the monogenic epilepsies and discusses the potential of novel precision therapeutics to treat these disorders. Pathogenic mechanisms of epilepsy include recessive (null alleles), haploinsufficiency, imprinting, gain-of-function, and dominant negative effects. Understanding which pathogenic mechanism(s) that underlie each genetic epilepsy is pivotal to design precision therapies that are most likely to be beneficial for the patient. Novel therapeutics discussed include gene therapy, gene editing, antisense oligonucleotides, and protein replacement. Discussions are illustrated and reinforced with examples from the literature.

### Prevalence of loss-of-function, gain-of-function and dominant-negative mechanisms across genetic disease phenotypes [^1153xPiv]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The different mechanism-based phenotype classifications are shown in Fig. 2b. As expected, dominant LOF phenotypes have the highest mean mLOF score (0.547), while GOF and DN phenotypes are strongly left-shifted, with mean mLOF scores of 0.480 and 0.474, respectively. Unknown phenotypes, those of dominant genes without reported mechanisms, show a left-skewed distribution with a mean of 0.484. This likely reflects detection bias, as non-LOF variants are more difficult to experimentally characterise and less well predicted by computational tools, leading to an apparent enrichment of alternative mechanisms in these genes.

Next, we classified AD phenotypes based on their highest mechanism-specific posterior scores into LOF, GOF, and DN categories to assess the contribution of different molecular mechanisms. We focused on three groups in particular: exclusively AD genes with a single phenotype, those with multiple phenotypes, and AD phenotypes in mixed-inheritance genes, i.e.g.enes associated with both AD and AR disorders. In Fig. 2c, we show the composition of predicted molecular mechanisms across these groups. Single-phenotype AD genes exhibited the largest fraction of phenotypes with a LOF mechanism, at 54.6%. The remaining fraction was attributed to GOF and DN mechanisms occurring at similar frequencies, at 23.8% and 21.6%, respectively. In multi-phenotype AD genes, the fraction of phenotypes with a LOF mechanism was lower, at 48.1%, followed by GOF at 32.5% and DN at 19.3%. This difference may be explained by the observation that multiple disease phenotypes are unlikely to arise in haploinsufficient genes, where reduced dosage (a form of LOF) already causes disease; thus, by exclusion, additional phenotypes are more likely to involve non-LOF mechanisms. AD phenotypes in mixed-inheritance genes had the lowest proportion of LOF mechanisms, at just 9.9%, followed by GOF at 53.6% and DN at 36.5%. As observed with the mLOF score distribution of these genes in Fig. 2a, this likely reflects a reduced likelihood of haploinsufficiency conferred by the presence of a recessive disorder, which makes dominant phenotypes more likely to arise through alternative mechanisms.

### Prevalence of loss-of-function, gain-of-function and dominant-negative mechanisms across genetic disease phenotypes [^112bMNJT]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Table 2
Inheritance- and mechanism-based classification of disease phenotypes

Figure 2a shows the mLOF score distribution for the different inheritance-based phenotype classifications, ordered by their mean. The observed distributions align remarkably well with our expectations: AR, [AR]-AD/AR mixed and XLR phenotypes display the highest mLOF scores. AD phenotypes, while shifted to the left side of the optimal threshold by the mean, are evidently bimodal, suggesting the presence of both LOF and non-LOF mechanisms. Interestingly, [AD]-AD/AR mixed phenotypes fall on the left side of the optimal threshold, with a mean of 0.499. This can be explained by considering that the coexistence of a recessive disorder provides a level of evidence against dosage sensitivity, thus making AD phenotypes in these genes more likely to arise through alternative mechanisms. In contrast, AD/AR same phenotypes have a higher mean mLOF score relative to AD phenotypes, which could result from the unequal mixing of AD and AR variants — a limitation inherent to our use of phenotype-level rather than variant-level annotations. Alternatively, missense variants in these phenotypes may follow a single inheritance mode, while other mutation types, such as protein null variants (e.g. nonsense or frameshift mutations that are presumed to completely abolish protein function), particularly when homozygous, correspond to the other mode. This phenomenon has been observed, for example, in ITPR1, where homozygous null and de novo missense variants both cause Gillespie syndrome.

### Where genotype is not predictive of phenotype: towards an understanding of the molecular basis of reduced penetrance in human inherited disease [^1153exfm]. Human Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

Table 1
Disease variants potentially capable of either causing dominant disease, or causing recessive disease and observed in the homozygous state, detected in 1000 Genomes Project participants (data from Xue et al.)

Reduced penetrance is one of several possible explanations for why some variants of putative pathological significance, listed in HGMD and/or Locus-specific Mutation Databases, nevertheless occur in apparently healthy individuals (Ashley et al; Bell et al; Xue et al; Golbus et al; Wang et al; Kenna et al; Shen et al.). It is not hard to see why reduced penetrance might be much more common among described mutations than originally thought: whereas known pathological mutations have almost invariably been identified through retrospective analyses of families or well-defined groups of clinically symptomatic patients, relatively few prospective studies of asymptomatic carriers have so far been performed to derive estimates of penetrance (e.g. Jensen et al; Mavaddat et al.). Indeed, establishing that a specific mutation identified in a particular patient with a given disease is the pathological lesion responsible for that individual's clinical phenotype does not allow one automatically to judge whether this mutant genotype will invariably give rise to the same clinical phenotype in all other individuals harbouring it. This can only be established (or refuted) empirically by comprehensive, ideally prospective, studies of the genotype in question.

### Identifying modifier genes of monogenic disease: strategies and difficulties [^116GFxdB]. Human Genetics (2008). Low credibility.

Substantial clinical variability is observed in many Mendelian diseases, so that patients with the same mutation may develop a very severe form of disease, a mild form or show no symptoms at all. Among the factors that may explain these differences in disease expression are modifier genes. In this paper, we review the different strategies that can be used to identify modifier genes and explain their advantages and limitations. We focus mainly on the statistical aspects but illustrate our points with a variety of examples from the literature.

### Mendelian disorders deserve more attention [^114TsgiK]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2006). Medium credibility.

The study of inherited monogenic diseases has contributed greatly to our mechanistic understanding of pathogenic mutations and gene regulation, and to the development of effective diagnostic tools. But interest has gradually shifted away from monogenic diseases, which collectively affect only a small fraction of the world's population, towards multifactorial, common diseases. The quest for the genetic variability associated with common traits should not be done at the expense of Mendelian disorders, because the latter could still contribute greatly to understanding the aetiology of complex traits.

### Where genotype is not predictive of phenotype: towards an understanding of the molecular basis of reduced penetrance in human inherited disease [^114vt8i1]. Human Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

Deleterious and disease alleles in the general population

In the wake of the sequencing of multiple human genomes, it has become apparent that healthy individuals can harbour quite large numbers of potentially disadvantageous variants without suffering any obvious ill effects (The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium; MacArthur et al; Xue et al; Shen et al.). The underlying reasons are likely to be many and varied: thus, the variants may damage the protein in question but the intact protein may not be necessary for the health of the carrier; individuals may be asymptomatic carriers of single-mutant alleles that could, in homozygosity or compound heterozygosity, cause recessive disease; the mutation may be dominant but the clinical phenotype might only be mild and classed as lying within the range of normal healthy variation; the disorder might be late in onset with expression being age- or sex-dependent; or the disorder may require additional genetic and/or environmental factors for it to manifest clinically.

Assessing the magnitude of the 'genetic burden' imposed on the general population by the presence of deleterious alleles has been a key aim of medical and population genetics for many decades. With the advent of large-scale sequencing technologies, it has become possible to estimate the number of amino acid substitutions in the human exome that would be predicted in silico to be damaging (Kryukov et al; Lohmueller et al; Boyko et al; Goode et al.). However, personal genome sequences have not only provided estimates of the number of disease variants carried by each subject (Asan et al.), but have also given us a glimpse of the likely complexity of the functional interpretation of such data (Ashley et al; Strom and Gorin). More recently, Tennessen et al. suggested that 2.3% of the 13,595 single nucleotide variants carried by the average person impact upon protein function, involving ~313 genes per human genome. Adopting an alternative approach, Bell et al. surveyed 437 genes known to be related to a recessive Mendelian disease and identified 2.8 mutations per individual (range 0–7). Taken together, these studies suggest that individuals typically carry hundreds of mildly disadvantageous variants and perhaps several tens of potentially severe disease alleles.

### Carrier screening for recessive disorders [^116pnKEA]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2019). High credibility.

Technological and other advances over the past decades have led to the discovery of thousands of gene-disease associations for autosomal and X-linked recessive Mendelian disorders. Combined with recent improvements in assessing individual variants in each human genome, these developments offer the possibility of testing populations for all known severe recessive genetic disorders. Past experience has provided the framework for expanded carrier screening, but many challenges remain regarding which disorders to include, how to interpret variants and how to incorporate newly discovered gene-disease links into existing screening programmes.

### Hunting human disease genes: lessons from the past, challenges for the future [^115sG4DV]. Human Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

A principal aim of medical genetics is the identification of the specific genes that, when altered, result in human disease. Most of the success in this endeavor has occurred in the context of Mendelian disorders — genetic diseases thought to reflect the action of a single gene-product with major effect. This group of disorders are recognizable in families by their adherence to one of the canonical patterns of inheritance first described by Gregor Mendel in 1865 and re-discovered in the early 1900s: autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, co-dominant or sex-linked. Mendelian disorders are individually rare and affect less than 5% of the population but are extraordinarily numerous. More than 7,000 such disorders have been described (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man), and countless other "private syndromes" may exist in only small numbers of individuals or even single families.

More than 3,600 Mendelian disorders, or ~50% of all those described, have now been associated with a specific molecular defect (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) (Fig. 1), speaking to both the remarkable success and the ongoing opportunity that exists in human disease gene mapping. Pathogenic mutations have been described in slightly more than 5,000 human genes (Human Gene Mutation Database.). However, data from other organisms suggest that a much higher percentage of the ~22,000 human genes may be associated with phenotypes when altered. For example, systematic gene mutation screens in yeast and mice suggest that most of the genes in those organisms are non-lethal and associated with a discernible phenotype when disrupted (Ayadi et al; Winzeler et al; Hillenmeyer et al.).

Simulations of temporal dynamics of hybridization where alleles for a reproductive barrier trait have partially dominant expression in one population, and with incomplete assortative mating.

Throughout the figure, red and blue colors indicate mating trait and selectively neutral clines, respectively. a Position of cline centers (Y axis) over a course of 500 generations of hybridization (X axis). The eight scenarios vary in the strength of assortative mating, degree of partial dominance and a number of loci underlying mating trait. All clines have centers initially positioned at 0.5 and are allowed to move towards a trait encoded by recessive homozygote (0) or dominant homozygote (1). Clines moving towards dominant homozygote in mating trait and selectively neutral loci are highlighted. b Frequency of cline centers displaced towards recessive homozygote (RH, 0–0.44), staying relatively stable in space (S, 0.45–0.55) and displaced towards dominant homozygote (DH, 0.56–1) by the end of the simulation. c Distribution of cline center positions for selectively neutral and mating trait loci for a subset of mating clines moved towards dominant homozygote (DH). Mean centers are indicated by dashed lines. P -values stand for paired one-sided Wilcoxon test. Note that under the tested parameter combinations, the mating cline will rarely stay stable in space and will be moving towards recessive or dominant homozygote genotype. The latter scenario, matching the pattern observed in the wagtail hybrid zone, was an especially likely outcome under the moderate partial dominance and moderate assortative mating.

### Genomic prediction of additive and non-additive effects using genetic markers and pedigrees [^113tXoNP]. G3 (2019). Medium credibility.

The simulated genome had 12 chromosomes with 100 cM. A set of 10,000 bi-allelic loci (e.g. SNP) were used in developing prediction models, and 30 or 1,000 QTL were simulated for oligogenic and polygenic traits, respectively. All traits had narrow sense heritability of 0.25. Three levels of dominance were evaluated: d 2: 0, 0.1 and 0.2, where d 2 is the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by dominance deviation -; andare dominance deviation and phenotypic variances respectively. The additive effect of a gene was defined as half of the difference between the alternative homozygotes, and the dominance effect was estimated by the difference between the heterozygote and the mean of the homozygotes. The distribution used forin oligogenic traits were gamma (rate = 1.66, shape = 0.4) with sign (positive or negative) sampled with equal probability. For polygenic traits, was simulated with standard normal distribution (mean = 0, sd = 1). When dominance was present, it was simulated by: wherewas sampled from a normal distribution with mean zero and standard deviation 1 and 2 for traits with medium- and high-dominance-levels, respectively. To achieve the targeted values of d 2, only samples that provided d 2 between 0.09 and 0.11 for medium-dominance traits and between 0.19 and 0.21 for high-dominance traits were kept. The simulated populations showed very similar allele frequencies, when compared across scenarios. Hence, d 2 was mostly defined by a larger or smaller sampled value of.

### Effect of salt stress on mutation and genetic architecture for fitness components in… [^1175keu4]. G3 (2020). Medium credibility.

In addition to changes in variance and genetic architecture, we found that for every fitness component examined, salt stress increased the phenotypically estimated mutation rate and decreased the average effect size compared to a benign environment. Although the consistently higher point estimate of the mutation rate under stress agreed with predictions, this parameter did not differ statistically between environmental treatments for any trait. Wide confidence intervals for mutation parameters are unfortunately typical of MA experiments (e.g.). Furthermore, average effect size is negatively correlated with mutation rate in the maximum-likelihood analyses, so these parameters cannot be compared independently. Using S. cerevisiae, recently performed an MA study in several environments considered mildly stressful, and then used whole-genome sequencing to determine the rate and spectrum of mutations. One of their environments matched ours — 1M NaCl in YPD medium — which in both studies initially reduced growth rate by one-half. As in our study, found that this stress doubled the mutation rate. This agreement between direct sequencing and fitness-based maximum likelihood is especially striking because the latter quantifies only mutations with some fitness effect.

Our measures of growth rate in both diploids and their derived haploids allowed us to estimate dominance levels of mutations affecting this trait. The estimates of 0.35 for normal-MA and 0.20 for salt-MA are typical of data from a variety of species which indicate that most deleterious mutations are partly recessive. Any loss of haploids because of exposed mutations will cause an underestimate of dominance level, because mean haploid fitness is increased, and this appears in the denominator. This method of dominance estimation assumes that the same genes affect growth rate in both ploidy levels. Several lines of evidence militate against this view. First, the genetic correlation arising from mutation between diploid and haploid growth rate was approximately 0.5 for both MA treatments and did not differ statistically from zero. If these were the same trait, then diploids and their derived haploids should show a genetic correlation of approximately one. Second, maximum-likelihood estimates of mutation parameters indicated that salt-MA induced more mutations of smaller effect compared to normal-MA. If this is true, the salt-MA dominance levels should have been higher because of the inverse relation between deleterious effect size and dominance. Finally, we found evidence for a small proportion of positive-effect mutations in haploid growth rate under salt stress, and beneficials can disrupt dominance estimates.

4 Genetic Interactions and Disease

Genetic synergy refers to a phenomenon where the combined effect of two or more variants is greater than the sum of their individual effects and leads to a distinguishable phenotype. In other words, when certain genetic variations interact, their effects are amplified leading to an outcome that cannot be explained by the effects of each individual gene alone. Understanding genetic synergy is crucial for unraveling the genetic basis of non‐Mendelian traits and diseases. The identification of synergistic interactions between genes can provide insights into the underlying biological mechanisms. An example of synergy is provided by combined HI, which emerges for the interaction of genes carry heterozygous null variants. Thus, a LoF variant in one gene behaves as a dominant mutation in the presence of a heterozygous LoF variant in another (interacting) gene. For instance, combined HI has been documented in a mouse model of cystinuria characterized by deficient renal reabsorption of cystine and dibasic amino acids, usually inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The condition may be caused by pathogenic variants in the genes coding for the two subunits of the respective heterodimeric amino acid transporter: Variants in SLC3A1 cause type A cystinuria, whereas variants in SLC7A9 cause type B cystinuria. Double heterozygous mice (Slc7a9 +/− Slc3a1 +/−) display a lower expression of the transporter system and a higher hyperexcretion of cystine than single heterozygotes, with lithiasis in 4% of them. This may be regarded as digenic inheritance or synergistic heterozygosity, although the deficiency is not as marked as homozygotes for either gene. A similar digenic/oligogenic effect may also occur when insufficient quantities of TFs act on the same promoters, or when they are primary regulators of sequential steps in a transcription cascade.

Preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic conditions (PGT-M) — posttest (results) counseling requires that in vitro fertilization providers should have a clear understanding of how the selected PGT-M laboratory reports test results, recognizing that results are often highly nuanced given the differences in Mendelian inheritance patterns and that carriers of autosomal recessive or X-linked conditions may be asymptomatic or may be at risk of developing symptoms or other health risks; laboratories may use differing terminology such as "carrier", "affected", "unaffected", "wild type", "normal", "negative", "heterozygous", and "homozygous", and results involving milder phenotypes, later onset, reduced penetrance, or uncertain significance may warrant additional counseling, with providers ensuring truly informed decisions and considering referral to a genetic counselor or other health care professional with relevant expertise.

### Genetic, morphometric, and molecular analyses of interspecies differences in head shape and hybrid developmental defects in the wasp genus nasonia [^112r5k7G]. G3 (2021). Medium credibility.

Head shape traits have different dominance relations, while head defect alleles are recessive

Due to the obligate haplodiploidy, Nasonia males are normally hemizygous, and interactions among alleles can be assessed in the absence of dominance effects. However, understanding the dominance relationships of alleles is helpful in understanding both the function of the genes involved in generating a phenotype, and the molecular nature of interactions that lead to changes or failure in development.

To study the dominance relationships between the two parental genomes while maintaining male-specific traits, we created diploid males using the previously described method of knocking down the maternal Nv-tra contribution by pRNAi. In the absence of maternal Nv-tra, mated females will produce diploid males. Therefore, Nv-tra dsRNA injected Nv females were mated to Ng males, which resulted in diploid, hybrid male offspring (Figure 3E). Since these offspring are F1 hybrids, no genetic recombination or assortment has occurred between the two species' genomes. In addition, no sex-based chromosomal differences in these species, because haplodiploids do not have sex chromosomes. Thus, each hybrid diploid receives an equal contribution of chromosomal genetic material from the parental species.

For all normalized head shape traits measured, the mean values for diploid hybrid males were between those of the parental species (Figure 4, Supplementary Table S3). For two measures, [maximum interocular width (MIO/HL, Figure 4C)] and cheek size (FEP/FE, Figure 4E) the F1 hybrid values were statistically different from both parental species males, indicating incomplete dominance of the alleles governing these traits. For head width across the antennae (AIO/HL, Figure 4D), and maximum head width (MHW/HL, Figure 4A), the F1 hybrid values were not statistically distinguishable from Ng males, which may indicate dominance of Ng alleles governing these traits. Finally, interocular width across the ocelli (OIO/HL, Figure 4C) in diploid hybrid males was statistically indistinguishable from Nv but significantly different from Ng, indicating dominance of the Nv alleles governing this trait.

In contrast, diploid males did not display any of the abnormal phenotypes that occur in haploid hybrids, such as midline clefting and, head asymmetry, indicating that it is not the mere presence of an allele from the other species that causes the developmental defects. Rather, it appears that hybrid head defects involve recessive epistatic interactions among loci from the two species, rather than incompatibilities within individual loci.

### Balancing selection via life-history trade-offs maintains an inversion polymorphism in a seaweed fly [^113wZ2Pa]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Overdominance emerges as a by-product of antagonistic pleiotropy, since the total fitness of heterozygotes is generally higher than both the fitness of homozygotes: αβ heterozygotes reach the highest fitness by combining a reproductive advantage due to large size (larger than ββ) and a survival advantage in natural conditions due to a shorter development time (shorter than αα). The parameter space leading to emergent overdominance is even more extended when dominance varies between fitness components, especially in the case of dominance reversal, that is when advantageous alleles for each component of fitness are dominant. Since the reversal of dominance between fitness components has only been explored theoretically so far, it is still unknown how common it is in nature and what genetic architecture may underlie it. Our data still suggests that, in C. frigida, dominance at the inversion locus does vary in strength and direction between survival and fertility, as well as between sexes. These findings are in line with recent studies in other species showing that dominance can vary depending on the sex, and that multivariate trait often involve the combination of trait-specific dominance. Overdominance may also emerge from the genetic architecture of the trait under antagonistic pleiotropy: inversions are frequently associated with deleterious effects, either because the breakpoints disrupt a gene, or because they contain recessive deleterious mutations which can only be purged by recombination and purifying selection when they occur at the homozygous state. The generally higher egg-to-adult viability of heterozygotes, which is enhanced in high-density conditions, led to the the hypothesis that the two haplotypic rearrangements of C. frigida may each contain different clusters of deleterious mutations, as suggested by intra-population and inter-population crosses. Such a linked genetic load may explain why the rarest αα genotype exhibits the highest deficit compared to Hardy–Weinberg expectations in natureand why the αα genotype has the lowest viability in laboratory conditions. Since α is less frequently found at the homozygous state than the β allele in nature, the purging of deleterious mutations linked to the α allele might be more limited than for the β allele. Such overdominance emerging from genetic load was thought to be the major mechanism underlying the maintenance of polymorphism in C. frigida. Yet, depending on the conditions of growth and on sex, the viability advantage of heterozygotes is not necessarily strong, and a heterozygote excess can also emerge in the eggs, emphasizing the role of non-random mating. Overdominance thus appears linked to two mechanisms, antagonistic pleiotropy and associated genetic load, which possibly enhance each other. Overdominance emerging from antagonistic pleiotropy may generate an excess of heterozygotes, which in turn limit the purging of the different recessive deleterious mutations associated with the two haplotypes. Such a sheltering of the genetic load associated with the inversions may in turn reinforce overdominance.

Description of the selection models used

Notation

In our epidemic-driven selection model we work with viabilities and use the following notation:

We are focusing on a locus with three genotypes aa (wildtype), Aa (heterozygous carrier of an advantageous mutation) and AA (homozygous carrier of an advantageous mutation). In this locus, we denote the number of individuals in the three genotype categories in generation,… We also denote the viabilities of the three genotypes V a a, V A a and V A A. Note that these translate into relative fitnesses with the following selection coefficients:using the following relative fitness model:

Recessive, additive and dominant selection

With this notation, then if we have a recessive model with s a a = s A a we get the viabilities V a a = V A a as this gives us:Similarly, if we have an additive model with s a a = 2 s A a we get that V A A − V a a = 2(V A A − V A a) as this gives us:In other words in an additive model the difference in viabilities of the genotypes aa and AA (V A A − V a a) has to be twice as high as the difference in viabilities of the genotypes Aa and AA (V A A − V A a).

Finally, if we have a dominant model with s A a = 0 (and thus w A a = 1 − s A a = 1 = w A A) we get the viabilities V A a = V A A as this gives us:

### What is the significance of difference in phenotypic variability across SNP genotypes? [^1116Ei3m]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

We studied the general problem of interpreting and detecting differences in phenotypic variability among the genotypes at a locus, from both a biological and a statistical point of view. The scales on which we measure interval-scale quantitative traits are man-made and have little intrinsic biological relevance. Before claiming a biological interpretation for genotype differences in variance, we should be sure that no monotonic transformation of the data can reduce or eliminate these differences. We show theoretically that for an autosomal diallelic SNP, when the three corresponding means are distinct so that the variance can be expressed as a quadratic function of the mean, there implicitly exists a transformation that will tend to equalize the three variances; we also demonstrate how to find a transformation that will do this. We investigate the validity of Bartlett's test, Box's modification of it, and a modified Levene's test to test for differences in variances when normality does not hold. We find that, although they may detect differences in variability, these tests do not necessarily detect differences in variance. The same is true for permutation tests that use these three statistics.

### Lethal mutations with fluctuating heterozygous effect: the lethal force of effective dominance [^116zWFt5]. Journal of Human Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

The theory of population genetics leads to the expectation that in very large populations the frequencies of recessive lethal mutations are close to the square root of the mutation rate, corresponding to mutation-selection balance. There are numerous examples where the frequencies of such alleles are orders of magnitude larger than this result. In this work we theoretically investigate the role of temporal fluctuations in the heterozygous effect (h) for lethal mutations in very large populations. For fluctuations of h, around a mean value of [Formula: see text], we find a biased outcome that is described by an effective dominance coefficient, h eff, that is generally less than the mean dominance coefficient, i.e., [Formula: see text]. In the case where the mean dominance coefficient is zero, the effective dominance coefficient is negative: h eff < 0, corresponding to the lethal allele behaving as though overdominant and having an elevated mean frequency. This case plausibly explains mean allele frequencies that are an order of magnitude larger than the equilibrium frequency of a recessive allele with a constant dominance coefficient. Our analysis may be relevant to explaining lethal disorders with anomalously high frequencies, such as cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs, and may open the door to further investigations into the statistics of fluctuations of the heterozygous effect.

### Genetic background alters dominance relationships between mat alleles in the ciliate tetrahymena thermophila [^1125ZGkX]. The Journal of Heredity (2013). Low credibility.

The pattern of inheritance and mechanism of sex determination can have important evolutionary consequences. We studied probabilistic sex determination in the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila, which was previously shown to cause evolution of skewed sex ratios. We find that the genetic background alters the sex determination patterns of mat alleles in heterozygotes and that allelic interaction can differentially influence the expression probability of the 7 sexes. We quantify the dominance relationships between several mat alleles and find that A-type alleles, which specify sex I, are indeed recessive to B-type alleles, which are unable to specify that sex. Our results provide additional support for the presence of modifier loci and raise implications for the dynamics of sex ratios in populations of T. thermophila.

### DHA intake relates to better cerebrovascular and neurodegeneration neuroimaging phenotypes in middle-aged adults at increased genetic risk of Alzheimer disease [^112VgFUX]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

We assessed differences between participants included in the analyses and the whole ALFA population by 1-factor ANOVA, the Kruskal–Wallis test, or the chi-square test, as appropriate.

We next constructed regression models to search for associations between self-reported DHA intake (predictor) and episodic memory and executive function composite scores, WMH burden, prevalence of CMBs, and cortical thickness in the AD signature (outcomes). We did not consider the presence of CMBs in deep brain and lacunar infarcts as outcomes owing to the low number of cases in our population study (n = 14 and n = 12, respectively). For each outcome, we tested the distinct models of APOE-ε4 penetrance, namely the dominant, recessive, and additive effects, as proposed for the analysis of quantitative trait loci. Briefly, an additive model predicts an incremental response of the quantitative trait according to the allelic load, whereas a dominant model predicts a common response to 1 copy or 2 copies of the risk allele (i.e. ε4 -carriers compared with noncarriers). Finally, a recessive model predicts a common response to 0 copies or 1 copy of the risk allele (i.e. noncarriers and ε4 -heterozygotes compared with ε4 -homozygotes).

### What colour are your eyes? Teaching the genetics of eye colour&colour vision. edridge green lecture RCOphth annual congress Glasgow may 2019 [^114r5KqQ]. Eye (2022). Medium credibility.

Eye colour and colour perception are excellent examples to use when teaching genetics as they encompass not simply the basic Mendelian genetics of dominant, recessive and X-linked disorders, but also many of the new concepts such as non-allelic diseases, polygenic disease, phenocopies, genome-wide association study (GWAS), founder effects, gene-environment interaction, evolutionary drivers for variations, copy number variation, insertions deletions, methylation and gene inactivation. Beyond genetics, colour perception touches on concepts involving optics, physics, physiology and psychology and can capture the imagination of the population, as we saw with social media trend of "#the dress". Television shows such as Game of Thrones focused attention on the eye colour of characters, as well as their Dire-wolves and Dragons. These themes in popular culture can be leveraged as tools to teach and engage everyone in genetics, which is now a key component in all eye diseases. As the explosion of data from genomics, big data and artificial intelligence transforms medicine, ophthalmologists need to be genetically literate. Genetics is relevant, not just for Inherited Retinal Diseases and congenital abnormalities but also for the leading causes of blindness: age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, myopia, diabetic retinopathy and cataract. Genetics should be part of the armamentarium of every practicing ophthalmologist. We need to ask every patient about their family history. In the near future, patients will attend eye clinics with genetic results showing they are at high risk of certain eye diseases and ophthalmologists will need to know how to screen, follow and treat these patients.

### Homozygous carriers of APP A713T mutation in an autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease family [^111akGnT]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To report, for the first time, a large autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease (AD) family in which the APP A713T mutation is present in the homozygous and heterozygous state. To date, the mutation has been reported as dominant, and in the heterozygous state associated with familial AD and cerebrovascular lesions.

Methods

The family described here has been genealogically reconstructed over 6 generations dating back to the 19th century. Plasma β-amyloid peptide was measured. Sequencing of causative AD genes was performed.

Results

Twenty-one individuals, all but 1 born from 2 consanguineous unions, were studied: 8 were described as affected through history, 5 were studied clinically and genetically, and 8 were asymptomatic at-risk subjects. The A713T mutation was detected in the homozygous state in 3 patients and in the heterozygous state in 8 subjects (6 asymptomatic and 2 affected).

Conclusions

Our findings, also supported by the β-amyloid plasma assay, confirm (1) the pathogenic role of the APP A713T mutation, (2) the specific phenotype (AD with cerebrovascular lesions) associated with this mutation, and (3) the large span of age at onset, not influenced by APOE, TOMM40, and TREM2 genes. No substantial differences concerning clinical phenotype were evidenced between heterozygous and homozygous patients, in line with the classic definition of dominance. Therefore, in this study, AD followed the classic definition of a dominant disease, contrary to that reported in a previously described AD family with recessive APP mutation. This confirms that genetic AD may be considered a disease with dominant and recessive traits of inheritance.

### Multiple mutations responsible for frequent genetic diseases in isolated populations [^115K5MQE]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2007). Low credibility.

The relatively frequent existence of an autosomal recessive disease in an isolated population suggests a founder effect. However, in many cases the high frequency is due to more than one mutation in either one or several genes. Several possibilities have been raised to explain these findings: a chance phenomenon, migration of families with affected patients or digenic inheritance. Although each of these possibilities may be responsible for a few of the cases, in most they are very improbable explanations. A selective advantage may explain most of the observations even if it is difficult to prove.

### Discovering genetic interactions bridging pathways in genome-wide association studies [^112zXWxG]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

SNP–SNP genetic interaction estimation

MM, Mm and mm are used to denote the three genotypes of each SNP, i.e. majority homozygous, heterozygous, and minority homozygous, respectively. Our method implements multiple disease models, which affect how interactions are estimated at the SNP–SNP interaction level. A minor allele (m) at each locus could be additive, dominant or recessive in the context of different diseases. For the additive model, we used the standard logistic regression-based model implemented in CASSIto quantify the interaction between two SNPs coded as follows, mm = 2, Mm = 1, MM = 0. In this model, the goodness-of-fit was compared between a standard logistic regression model with an interaction term between the two loci of interest and a standard logistic regression without an interaction term, and the significance of the interaction was measured by a likelihood ratio test. We refer to this type of SNP–SNP interaction as an additive–additive (AA) model-based interaction. In the dominant model, a SNP is encoded as mm = 1, Mm = 1, MM = 0. In the recessive model, a SNP is encoded as mm = 1, Mm = 0, MM = 0. Because the minor allele could have recessive (R) or dominant (D) contribution to disease at two different loci comprising an interaction, four types of SNP–SNP interactions were examined: recessive–recessive (RR), dominant–dominant (DD), recessive–dominant (RD), and dominant–recessive (DR) model-based interaction for each pair of SNPs. The interactions under these four models can also be estimated by a logistic regression-based model similar to the AA case except with the appropriate encoding of the SNP genotypes. Alternatively, the RR, DD, DR, and RD interactions can be estimated by explicit statistical tests (e.g. hypergeometric tests) of the association between a specific genotype combination of two SNPs and a disease of interest, where this association is compared to the association between each of the individual SNPs and the disease (marginal effect). Interactions estimated by logistic regression-based models directly capture non-additive effects between two SNPs considering different combinations of SNP genotypes. In contrast, interactions estimated by explicit statistical tests have the flexibility of specifically testing certain combinations of genotypes for association with the phenotype. We explored alternative approaches both in representing different disease models and in the estimation of SNP–SNP interactions, and found that RR, DD, DR, and RD interactions estimated by explicit statistical tests more likely led to the discovery of significant BPMs/WPMs in the context of our BridGE approach. The measure we developed based on explicit statistical tests, called hygeSSI, is described in detail below. The relationship between hygeSSI and logistic regression-based models is explored in more depth in "Comparison with logistic regression-based interactions" section.

### CLPB deficiency, a mitochondrial chaperonopathy with neutropenia and neurological presentation [^116SdhC5]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

The reasons determining whether a specific variant results in the recessive or dominant disease are currently unknown. Interestingly, some of the dominant variants occur in the close vicinity of the recessive ones, as is the case with K404T (dominant) — R408G/W (recessive), N496K (dominant) — E501K and Y617C (recessive) — R620C/H (dominant) — R628C (recessive) (Figure 2). A perplexing issue is why the SCN‐related variants, with such a devastating influence on the ATPase and disaggregase activity on the wild‐type protein in vitro, result in a relatively mild phenotype in patients. Then again, the K404T variant associated with the MGA 7A phenotype (dominant CLPB deficiency) did not manifest neutropenia.

Heart Rhythm (2011). Medium credibility.

Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) clinical features and inheritance — ACM is a progressive, heritable myocardial disorder that is a leading cause of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death (SCD) in people age ≤ 35 years, and the disease may involve either or both ventricles but is most well recognized in its classic subtype with right-sided preponderance, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). Clinical diagnosis is based on demonstration of characteristic ECG, arrhythmic, structural, and/or histological abnormalities, and a confirmed family history and/or the presence of a definite or probable disease-causing mutation also contributes to diagnosis; the clinical presentation typically is with arrhythmia rather than heart failure manifestations. ACM/ARVC is most commonly transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait, autosomal recessive forms are rare, and compound heterozygous and digenic heterozygosity frequently (up to 10% of the time) are identified.

Gamete and embryo donation — nondirected donor eligibility: monogenic conditions specify that the donor should not be known to carry a mutation for an autosomal-dominant or X-linked disorder, with exceptions for conditions considered to have more mild health risks to carriers, as long as recipients are informed of potential health risks to offspring. Donors with a known family history of a dominant, recessive, or X-linked disorder may be referred for genetic counseling and potentially genetic testing for that specific disorder, when desired and appropriate, and donors with a known family history (in a first-, second-, or third-degree relative) of a dominant or X-linked disorder that has the potential to have been passed on to the donor should be excluded in the absence of risk-reducing genetic testing. Genetic test results may determine the appropriateness of using that donor, and donors with negative genetic testing for themselves or an appropriate intervening relative for a familial mutation are eligible to donate, pending review of the genetic test reports by a certified genetic counselor or professional boarded by ABMG or ABGC. Donors whose family history is strongly suggestive of an undiagnosed autosomal-dominant or X-linked disease should be excluded when the donor is at increased risk, and donors may be referred for additional clinical screening, genetic counseling, or genetic testing, which could reduce the risk to offspring and make the donor eligible.

### Molecular mechanism of dominant expression in 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency [^115eSubL]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2005). Low credibility.

Most enzyme deficiencies in humans are inherited as autosomal recessive traits. The term dominant negative is applied to mutant alleles in which a mutant protein interferes in one way or another with the function of the normal protein being produced from the wild-type allele in a heterozygote. Such a dominant negative effect usually involves homomeric or heteromeric proteins. 3-Methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC) is a heteromeric mitochondrial enzyme comprised of biotin containing MCCalpha subunits and smaller MCCbeta subunits, encoded by the genes MCCA and MCCB, respectively. Mutations in these genes cause isolated MCC deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder with a variable phenotype ranging from severe neonatal to asymptomatic adult forms. Patients with MCC deficiency have a characteristic organic aciduria with greatly increased excretion of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid (3-HIVA) and 3-methylcrotonyl-glycine (3-MCG). Here, two patients with elevated excretion of 3-MCG and 3-HIVA and partial deficiency of MCC are discussed, one of them with severe neurological symptoms. Both showed evidence of biotin responsiveness and were heterozygous for the missense mutation MCCA-R385S. Evidence is presented that MCCA-R385S is a dominant negative allele leading to biochemical abnormalities and clinical symptoms in heterozygous individuals and that it is responsive to pharmacological doses of biotin in vivo.

Single gene disorders with Mendelian inheritance patterns have contributed greatly to the identification of genes and pathways implicated in genetic disease. In these cases, molecular analysis predicts disease status relatively directly. However, there are many abnormalities which show familial recurrence and have a clear genetic component, but do not show regular Mendelian segregation patterns. Defining the causative gene for non-Mendelian diseases is more difficult, and even when the underlying gene is known, there is uncertainty for prenatal prediction. However, detailed examination of the different mechanisms that underlie non-Mendelian segregation provides insight into the types of interaction that regulate more complex disease genetics.

Introduction

The molecular basis of Mendelian traits continues to be clarified as new technologies improve the classic strategies of gene mapping and mutation detection, producing insights with just a few patients with a rare disorder. This increase in knowledge is a promising development, fueling the expectation that patients and their families will benefit from unraveling the molecular basis of these disorders. However, this improved knowledge is frequently not met by an increased capability of the clinician to recognize, identify, and diagnose patients with these many rare disorders. This conundrum, in our opinion, is largely due to the fact that the genetics evaluation is still predominantly phenotype-oriented. Therefore, the clinician's experience and engagement are important variables, contributing to the lack of recognition of signs and symptoms (patterns) if the phenotype is rare or atypical. Clearly, innovative and more effective approaches are needed to achieve a timely diagnosis, to optimize management, to identify action for surveillance and anticipatory guidance, to communicate recurrence risk, and to counsel regarding reproductive options.

### Oligogenic inheritance in severe adult obesity [^115Nkivc]. International Journal of Obesity (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Obesity is a genetically heterogeneous disorder that is known to occur in multifactorial, monogenic, or syndromic forms. The increasing availability of whole-exome sequencing (sequencing of the genomic regions encoding proteins and closely linked regulatory regions), has improved our understanding of those sub-forms of obesity that are inherited in a simple Mendelian fashion. However, we are still some way from appreciating the full complexity of its genetic architecture, including explanations for the variable penetrance of known pathogenic mutations (whether or not a carrier of a harmful mutation expresses the expected trait). It is possible that, at least in some cases, more than one genetic deficit may be required for production of a severe phenotype. The concept of inheritance patterns more complex than simple Mendelian dominance or recessivity has been suggested previously in obesity syndromes and other conditions, but the implications of this in people ascertained only for severe obesity remains unclear.

Here, we present results suggesting oligogenic inheritance of obesity (whereby a small number of mutations act together to cause the phenotype), first in a family trio where the proband has obesity and learning difficulties, and subsequently in unrelated adults with severe obesity, but without known learning disability or dysmorphism.

### Autozygosity reveals recessive mutations and novel mechanisms in dominant genes: implications in variant interpretation [^115CCpnK]. Genetics in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study is to describe recessive alleles in strictly dominant genes. Identifying recessive mutations in genes for which only dominant disease or risk alleles have been reported can expand our understanding of the medical relevance of these genes both phenotypically and mechanistically. The Saudi population is enriched for autozygosity, which enhances the homozygous occurrence of alleles, including pathogenic alleles in genes that have been associated only with a dominant inheritance pattern.

Methods

Exome sequencing of patients from consanguineous families with likely recessive phenotypes was performed. In one family, the genotype of the deceased children was inferred from their parents due to lack of available samples.

Results

We describe the identification of 11 recessive variants (5 of which are reported here for the first time) in 11 genes for which only dominant disease or risk alleles have been reported. The observed phenotypes for these recessive variants were novel (e.g. FBN2-related myopathy and CSF1R-related brain malformation and osteopetrosis), typical (e.g. ACTG2-related visceral myopathy), or an apparently healthy state (e.g. PDE11A), consistent with the corresponding mouse knockout phenotypes.

Conclusion

Our results show that, in the era of genomic sequencing and "reverse phenotyping", recessive variants in dominant genes should not be dismissed based on perceived "incompatibility" with the patient's phenotype before careful consideration. Genet Med advance online publication 06 April 2017.

### Evolution of dominance mechanisms at a butterfly mimicry supergene [^115QPahw]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Dominance of colours

Then we analysed to which extent coordination and mosaic of dominance observed throughout the wings could be explained by a hierarchy in colour expression. By quantifying the wing colour patterns we were able to describe the pairwise dominance relationship between the three colours in heterozygotes (Fig. 3). Our results suggest that dominance relationships between the six alleles in the derived class (alleles carrying the inversion) is well explained by a transitive hierarchy of colour expression with black > orange > yellow. Across all relevant positions on the wing from crosses within the derived class, yellow was consistently recessive to orange; indeed, on the wings of heterozygotes, yellow was expressed in only 3.1% of the pixels for which homozygotes were yellow versus orange. Yellow was also consistently recessive to black (in heterozygotes, yellow was expressed in only 3.6% of relevant pixels). Orange was generally recessive to black (in heterozygotes, orange was expressed in only 29% of relevant pixels). Among alleles of the derived class, this transitive colour dominance hierarchy predicts the phenotype of heterozygotes in 79% of the wing areas where parental homozygotes display distinct colours (see Methods section). This indicates that both the coordination and the mosaic of dominance observed between alleles of the derived class were mostly a consequence of this colour hierarchy. Moreover, heterozygotes frequently express orange in 21% of pixels where homozygotes express black versus yellow (Fig. 3). Although our analysis considers this as a deviation from the colour hierarchy rule (under which black should be expressed), the expression of orange in black/yellow heterozygotes may reflect the intermediate position of orange in the hierarchy. The remaining part of the phenotypes unpredicted by this colour hierarchy was mainly caused by two different observations. First, intermediate patches size or shapes in heterozygotes caused deviations to the colour hierarchy predictions. Second, the variability of individual phenotypes compared with the modal wing patterns used for dominance quantification can also explain why in some wing areas (that is, white areas on the dominance heat maps), heterozygotes resemble neither homozygotes (on average 6.9% of the heterozygotes' wing surface and especially along patch boundaries, for example, Fig. 2j).

### Current and future advances in genetic testing in systemic autoinflammatory diseases [^1149stmZ]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Monogenic autoinflammatory diseases and mode of inheritance

Autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance

Most monogenic SAIDs are inherited by one of the classical modes of inheritance, namely autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant (Table 1). An individual with an autosomal recessive genetic disorder must carry biallelic pathogenic variants in the same gene, either in a homozygous or in a compound heterozygous state. Each pathogenic mutation must be transmitted from each unaffected parent (in trans) unless one mutation arose as a de novo in the patient. Parental testing is highly recommended to confirm clinical diagnosis at the molecular level. The pathophysiology of recessively inherited diseases can usually be explained by a loss-of-function mechanism, which is when the loss of protein expression and/or function from both alleles causes the disease. These mutations are often found in genes that encode ubiquitously expressed enzymes and result in more global phenotypes that present early in life. The classic example of a recessive hereditary SAID is mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD), caused by biallelic mutations in the MVK gene. Other examples include deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2 (DADA2), caused by biallelic mutations in the ADA2 gene, and sideroblastic anaemia with B cell immunodeficiency, periodic fevers and developmental delay, which is caused by biallelic mutations in the TRNT1 gene.

Monogenic systemic autoinflammatory disorders

Dominantly inherited disorders are caused by a single pathogenic variant that either arose de novo during gametogenesis or was inherited from an affected parent. However, there are examples of reduced penetrance in dominantly inherited traits whereby a causal mutation is inherited from an unaffected parent or is present in other unaffected family members. Typical examples of dominantly inherited SAIDs are inflammasomopathies, in which patients carry a heterozygous missense mutation that leads to gain in the protein function. Another mechanism for dominantly inherited SAIDs is by a haploinsufficiency when the single functional copy of the gene is not enough to maintain the protein function. This example includes haploinsufficiency of A20 (HA20) that is caused by truncating mutations in the TNFAIP3 gene. Parental testing is necessary to confirm de novo mutations. Most dominantly inherited pathogenic variants are novel, but some are reported at a very low frequency in large public databases of human gene alleles.

### Genetics basics… [^113PVNcD]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

They decide if a person is born a male or female. A female has two X chromosomes, and a male has one X and one Y chromosome. Each daughter gets an X from her mother and an X from her father. Each son gets an X from his mother and a Y from his father. Genetic Disorders Genetic disorders can happen for many reasons. Genetic disorders often are described in terms of the chromosome that contains the gene that is changed in people who have the disorder. If the gene is on one of the first 22 pairs of chromosomes, called the autosomes, the genetic disorder is called an autosomal condition. If the gene is on the X chromosome, the disorder is called X-linked. Genetic disorders also are grouped by how they run in families. Disorders can be dominant or recessive, depending on how they cause conditions and how they run in families. Dominant Dominant diseases can be caused by only one copy of a gene having a DNA mutation.

If one parent has the disease, each child has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutated gene. Recessive For recessive diseases, both copies of a gene must have a DNA mutation in order to get one of these diseases. If both parents have one copy of the mutated gene, each child has a 25% chance of having the disease, even though neither parent has it. In such cases, each parent is called a carrier of the disease. They can pass the disease on to their children, but do not have the disease themselves. For example, sickle cell disease is an autosomal single gene disorder. It is caused by a mutation in a gene found on chromosome 11. Sickle cell disease causes anemia and other complications. Fragile X syndrome, on the other hand, is an X-linked single gene disorder. It is caused by a change in a gene on the X chromosome. It is the most common known cause of intellectual disability and developmental disability that can be inherited.

Changes in Chromosomes Sometimes chromosomes are incomplete or shaped differently than usual. Missing a small part of a chromosome is called a deletion. A translocation is when part of one chromosome has moved to another chromosome. An inversion is when part of a chromosome has been flipped over. For example, people with Williams syndrome are missing a small part of chromosome 7. This deletion can result in intellectual disability and a distinctive facial appearance and personality.

### Triple X-sex… [^111fARne]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Many of us recall the course in Introduction to Biology in college and discussion of the Austrian-Augustinian Abbott, Gregor J. Mendel, and his garden of vegetable peas. His contributions on the theory of the gene are classic and are recognized as the cornerstone of the science of genetics. 1 The communication was published in 1866 in the Proceedings of the Society for Natural Science of Brünn, formerly in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Several varieties of peas, procured from seedsmen, were subjected to a two-year trial period in order to determine their genetic purity. Twenty-two of the varieties that remained constant were retained for subsequent study. Hand fertilization, protection from foreign pollens, and maintenance of maximum fertility assured Mendel of the validity of his experimental procedure. The differentiation of character by the letters A, B, a, b that was applied first to peas was of great significance later in. TRIPLE X-SEX. JAMA.

### How von Willebrand disease is inherited… [^114EAhgL]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Von Willebrand disease is caused by genetic changes that are almost always inherited or passed down from a parent to a child.
- There are two different ways that VWD can be inherited, autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive, depending on the type of VWD present. Each person has two copies of most genes, one from his or her mother and one from his or her father. Each copy is called an allele. In people who have VWD, there is a change in the gene for making the VWF protein, called a VWD allele. VWD can be passed down from either the mother or the father or both parents to the child. There are two different ways that VWD can be inherited, autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive, depending on the type of VWD present. Type 1 and most type 2 VWD Autosomal dominant VWD is caused by changes in only one copy of the gene related to the disorder.

In autosomal dominant inheritance, a child will inherit the bleeding disorder if he or she gets a VWD allele from one parent who has the disorder. If one parent has severe type 1 VWD that was inherited from both of his or her parents, meaning that he or she has 2 VWD alleles, and the other parent does not have an allele that can cause VWD, all children will get only one VWD allele and have type 1 VWD that is less severe than the parent who has 2 VWD alleles. Type 3 VWD and type 2N VWD Autosomal recessive VWD is caused by changes in both copies of the gene related to the disorder, so that neither copy works correctly. In autosomal recessive inheritance, both parents have one VWD allele and one normal allele, but they don't have the disorder; only a person with two VWD alleles will have the disorder.

The child of a parent with type 3 or type 2N VWD will receive a VWD allele from the parent who has VWD but will not have VWD if the other parent does not have a VWD allele. However, all of the children can pass the VWD allele down to their children.

### Inherited retinal detachment… [^11628jj6]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Aside from gross congenital anomalies such as falciform folds and colobomata, the known hereditary causes of retinal detachment include myopic degeneration, 1 retinoschisis, 2, 3 vitreous degeneration, 4 and peripheral retinal degeneration. 5 Vitreous and retinal degeneration are known to be associated with high myopia and to predispose to retinal detachment. 6 Edmund reported 5 families in whom retinal detachment occurred in high myopes. 1 His findings of 3 families with dominant transmission and 2 with recessive transmission agree with the known variable heredity of myopia itself.
6. Retinoschisis, as outlined by Levy, 2 is a sex-linked recessive disease with a predilection for inferior temporal quadrant of the globe. Abnormal vitreoretinal adhesions may be responsible for retinal tears and detachment. 7 Since these abnormalities are often bilateral and symmetrical, they are likely to be of hereditary origin. Familial occurrence of vitreous membranes is reported.

### Electroretinography and retinitis pigmentosa… [^113FicGP]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Electroretinography has been utilized to claim that the various hereditary subtypes of retinitis pigmentosa could be distinguished according to the temporal characteristics of the b wave. This study compares two different ERG techniques, one utilizing constant amplitude response and the other balanced photopic and scotopic stimuli, for the early diagnosis of RP. Both methods were found to be reliable objective tests for diagnosing RP. Neither test could differentiate between dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked RP.
