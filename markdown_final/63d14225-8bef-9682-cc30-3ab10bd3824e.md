## Question

How to correct hyponatremia outpatient

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to correct hyponatremia in the outpatient setting. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and classifying the hyponatremia. Then, I should verify the severity and chronicity to set correction targets. Next, I will determine volume status and likely etiology to choose therapy. After that, I need to select first-line outpatient strategies and escalation options, including urea, vaptans, and special populations. Finally, I should define monitoring, safety thresholds, and what to do if overcorrection occurs, and close with a concise algorithm summary.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and classification, because pseudohyponatremia or hypertonic hyponatremia would change management entirely. I need to check serum sodium, plasma osmolality, glucose, and consider translocational hyponatremia from hyperglycemia before labeling this as true hypotonic hyponatremia, and I should also distinguish acute (< 48 hours) from chronic (> 48 hours) given the different correction risks and targets.

> Wait, let me verify severity and chronicity before I set targets. Mild is 130–134 mEq/L, moderate 125–129 mEq/L, and severe ≤ 124 mEq/L, and chronicity matters because chronic cases carry a higher risk of osmotic demyelination if corrected too fast, so I should cap daily correction at 8–10 mEq/L in high-risk patients and 10–12 mEq/L in standard-risk patients, with a 48-hour limit of 18 mEq/L, and I should also identify high-risk features such as sodium ≤ 105 mEq/L, alcohol use disorder, hypokalemia, malnutrition, or advanced liver disease to apply stricter limits.

> I will now examine volume status and etiology, because treatment hinges on this. Hypovolemic hyponatremia responds to isotonic saline, hypervolemic cases need fluid restriction and diuresis, and euvolemic SIADH is managed with fluid restriction first-line, with urine osmolality > 500 mOsm/kg predicting poor response to fluid restriction and favoring earlier escalation, so I should confirm volume status clinically and with urine studies when needed [^114xRHnt] [^114oZizi].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about therapy before I anchor first-line outpatient measures. For most chronic euvolemic SIADH, fluid restriction to about 800–1,000 mL/day is first-line, with salt tablets or oral hypertonic solutions as adjuncts to increase solute load and free water excretion, and I should counsel on adherence and realistic expectations because fluid restriction alone fails in roughly half of patients, especially with high urine osmolality [^114xRHnt] [^1114uqkz].

> Let me consider escalation when fluid restriction fails or is not feasible. Oral urea at 30–60 g/day in divided doses is a safe, effective, and inexpensive second-line option that increases free water clearance without risking overcorrection, and observational data show meaningful sodium rises with good tolerability, though I should confirm that patients can adhere to taste and dosing, and I should monitor for gastrointestinal upset or hypernatremia with excessive dosing [^116Pp77B] [^112ykbco] [^1162Mnj7].

> But wait, what if I need faster correction or urea is not acceptable. Tolvaptan is a selective V2 antagonist that can reliably raise sodium, yet I should reserve it for selected outpatients given cost, hepatic safety concerns with prolonged high-dose use, and the need for close monitoring; if used, I should start in a monitored setting, reassess within 24 hours, and stop or interrupt if the rise exceeds 8–10 mEq/L in 24 hours, with particular caution in cirrhosis where the indication is limited [^116NqJCy] [^1116jHGB].

> I should double-check special populations because thresholds and choices differ. In cirrhosis with ascites, fluid restriction is advised for mild hyponatremia and long-term albumin has been associated with improved sodium normalization, so I need to coordinate with hepatology and avoid overly aggressive correction. In heart failure, fluid restriction and diuresis are prioritized, and fluid restriction alone often undercorrects, so I should set expectations and consider urea or carefully selected vaptan use. In older adults, even mild chronic hyponatremia correlates with falls and fractures, so I should correct cautiously and evaluate bone health and fall risk [^113RUmSC] [^111U8ry2] [^111u89LK] [^113fQANe].

> Next, I should review monitoring cadence and safety thresholds. For moderate hyponatremia, I need to check sodium every 2–3 days initially, then weekly until stable, and for severe hyponatremia, I should monitor every 1–2 days early on, with a hard stop to reassess if the daily rise approaches 8–10 mEq/L, and I should educate patients to report neurologic changes promptly because overcorrection risk rises with lower starting sodium and high urine output [^116JUkNn] [^1114uqkz].

> Hold on, I should verify what to do if overcorrection threatens. If sodium rises too fast, I should stop active therapy and consider desmopressin to halt aquaresis, and if the limit is exceeded, I can administer electrolyte-free water with or without desmopressin to safely relower sodium toward the target trajectory, documenting the rationale and monitoring closely for neurologic sequelae [^116VvNY1] [^113ToEcJ] [^115yzmgu].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency. Confirm true hypotonic hyponatremia and classify severity and chronicity, determine volume status and etiology, start with cause-specific therapy and fluid restriction for SIADH, escalate to urea if restriction fails or is not tolerated, reserve tolvaptan for selected cases with close monitoring, apply stricter correction limits in high-risk patients, and monitor sodium frequently with a plan to relower if overcorrection occurs, adjusting therapy iteratively as the patient stabilizes [^114xRHnt] [^116JUkNn] [^116Pp77B].

---

Outpatient correction of hyponatremia centers on **fluid restriction** as first-line for euvolemic SIADH, with **oral urea** or **tolvaptan** as second-line options if restriction fails [^116Pp77B] [^1116jHGB]. For hypovolemic cases, use **isotonic saline**; for hypervolemic cases, restrict fluids and add a loop diuretic. Monitor sodium every 2–3 days initially, then weekly once stable, and avoid correcting by more than 8–10 mmol/L in 24 hours to prevent osmotic demyelination [^116JUkNn]. Educate patients on adherence, symptom monitoring, and when to seek urgent care.

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Before initiating treatment, **confirm true hyponatremia** and classify it by volume status and chronicity:

- **Confirm true hyponatremia**: Measure serum sodium, plasma osmolality, and exclude pseudohyponatremia or hypertonic hyponatremia [^114xRHnt].

- **Classify by volume status**: Hypovolemic, euvolemic (e.g. SIADH), or hypervolemic (e.g. heart failure, cirrhosis) [^114xRHnt].

- **Determine chronicity**: Acute (< 48 hours) vs chronic (> 48 hours) to guide correction limits [^114CwAdv].

---

## General principles of outpatient management

- **Treat underlying cause**: Address the etiology (e.g. stop offending drugs, treat endocrine or organ dysfunction) [^112n6Umk].

- **Monitor closely**: Frequent sodium checks and symptom surveillance to avoid rapid correction [^114Mqs3L].

- **Educate patients**: Emphasize adherence, fluid limits, and warning signs (confusion, seizures, severe nausea) [^notfound].

---

## Specific outpatient therapies by etiology

| **Etiology** | **First-line therapy** | **Second-line therapy** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Euvolemic (SIADH) | Fluid restriction (800–1,000 mL/day) | - Oral urea (30–60 g/day) <br/> - Tolvaptan (7.5–15 mg/day) | - Urea is effective, safe, and inexpensive [^116Pp77B] <br/> - Tolvaptan is potent but costly and requires monitoring [^116NqJCy] |
| Hypovolemic | Isotonic saline (oral or IV) | N/A | Correct volume to restore sodium |
| Hypervolemic | - Fluid restriction <br/> - Loop diuretic | Consider tolvaptan in refractory cases | Address underlying heart failure or cirrhosis [^113RUmSC] |

---

## Monitoring and safety

- **Initial monitoring**: Check sodium every 2–3 days until stable, then weekly [^notfound].

- **Correction limits**: ≤ 8–10 mmol/L in 24 hours; ≤ 18 mmol/L in 48 hours to avoid osmotic demyelination [^116JUkNn].

- **Patient education**: Teach symptom recognition and when to seek urgent care [^notfound].

---

## Patient education and follow-up

Patient education should cover **fluid restriction adherence**, recognition of symptoms (confusion, seizures, severe nausea), and when to seek urgent care. Follow-up should be regular to monitor sodium, assess response, and adjust therapy as needed.

---

## Indications for hospitalization

Hospitalize if **severe symptoms** are present (e.g. seizures, coma, respiratory arrest), if sodium is ≤ 120 mmol/L with high-risk features, or if rapid correction is needed. Also admit when outpatient therapy fails or adherence is uncertain.

---

Outpatient correction of hyponatremia relies on **cause-specific therapy**, close monitoring, and patient education, with fluid restriction for SIADH and escalation to urea or tolvaptan if needed, while strictly avoiding rapid correction.

### Management of chronic hyponatremia in the outpatient setting [^117F2NEf]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

The diagnostic evaluation and management of chronic hyponatremia in outpatients can be challenging for several reasons. First, chronic hyponatremia is often mild, leading to uncertainty about whether it is clinically significant and warrants further diagnostic evaluation and treatment. Second, if the initial diagnostic workup does not identify a clear cause, it becomes uncertain how much further investigation is required. Third, when no clear cause is found or the underlying condition cannot be treated, physicians may struggle to choose the most appropriate treatment approach. This review offers practical guidance to navigate these challenges in managing chronic hyponatremia in the outpatient setting.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^114xRHnt]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are common findings in the inpatient and outpatient settings. Sodium disorders are associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Plasma osmolality plays a critical role in the pathophysiology and treatment of sodium disorders. Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are classified based on volume status (hypovolemia, euvolemia, and hypervolemia). Sodium disorders are diagnosed by findings from the history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and evaluation of volume status. Treatment is based on symptoms and underlying causes. In general, hyponatremia is treated with fluid restriction (in the setting of euvolemia), isotonic saline (in hypovolemia), and diuresis (in hypervolemia). A combination of these therapies may be needed based on the presentation. Hypertonic saline is used to treat severe symptomatic hyponatremia. Medications such as vaptans may have a role in the treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. The treatment of hypernatremia involves correcting the underlying cause and correcting the free water deficit.

### Mild chronic hyponatremia in the ambulatory setting: significance and management [^115rvcWm]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Mild chronic hyponatremia, as defined by a persistent (> 72 hours) plasma sodium concentration between 125 and 135 mEq/L without apparent symptoms, is common in ambulatory patients and generally perceived as being inconsequential. The association between increased mortality and hyponatremia in hospitalized patients in various settings and etiologies is widely recognized. This review analyzes the significance of mild chronic hyponatremia in ambulatory subjects and its effects on mortality and morbidity. It addresses whether this disorder should even be treated and if so, which patients are likely to benefit from treatment. The available approaches to correct hyponatremia in such patients in the context of recently published panel-generated recommendations and guidelines are described.

### Is hyponatremia after geriatric trauma the new frailty? [^113fQANe]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

As our older adult population grows exponentially in the coming decade, research to improve the care of older adults during hospitalization is critical. In this edition of TSACO, Naaseh et al undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the relationship between hyponatremia and clinical outcomes in geriatric trauma patients with a specific focus on falls and fractures. Synthesizing data from four retrospective cohort studies, the study encompassed nearly 12 000 patients and is the largest study of this topic to date.

The authors found that hyponatremia in the elderly is associated with a significant risk of in-hospital and long-term mortality and increased length of stay. Notably, across all studies, most patients had only mild hyponatremia. There was significant variation in age criteria, outcome definitions, and comparator groups, and many outcomes were not collected by every study, meaning that a meta-analysis could not be performed for each outcome. Perhaps most telling, all studies were deemed very low quality by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach.

The etiology of hyponatremia in the elderly is wide-ranging, and the source of this electrolyte disturbance is likely related to multiple patient outcomes. For example, in geriatric patients with hyponatremia or eunatremia matched for age, comorbidity, and presenting complaints, hyponatremic patients performed worse on cognitive and motor function testsbut improved after hyponatremia was corrected.

The potential role of hyponatremia as a marker of comorbid conditions rather than an independent contributor to poor outcomes remains an open question. Prospective studies are needed to determine whether early correction of hyponatremia improves outcomes in geriatric trauma patients. Given that sodium may be a marker for many other problems as opposed to the problem itself, aggressive correction of sodium at admission unless otherwise indicated may not be beneficial. In this way, hyponatremia may be much like frailty — in-hospital intervention may not be fruitful but is still important to recognize for risk stratification. Because this systematic review and meta-analysis showed that hyponatremia is a risk factor for in-hospital mortality, early awareness of hyponatremia may alert clinicians to be alert for signs of complications. Importantly, because sodium levels were not only associated with in-hospital mortality but also a key indicator of health and risk, it is likely the outpatient setting where primary care physicians or other care providers should be prompted to check sodium levels, and if a patient is hyponatremic, assess the patient's modifiable risk factors for falls to avoid the hospitalization for traumatic injury in the first place.

### Lixivaptan safely and effectively corrects serum sodium concentrations in hospitalized patients with euvolemic hyponatremia [^112LSSjd]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder associated with increased morbidity and mortality, particularly in the elderly. Lixivaptan, a new selective vasopressin V2-receptor antagonist, safely corrected serum sodium concentrations in phase II studies of patients with euvolemic hyponatremia. Here our multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III study assessed the effect of lixivaptan on serum sodium concentrations in 106 initially hospitalized patients with euvolemic hyponatremia (serum sodium less than 130 mmol/l). Of them, 52 were randomized to receive placebo and 54 received 50 mg lixivaptan once daily and were then titrated to receive 25–100 mg once daily depending on serum sodium concentration. Fluid restriction was at the investigator's discretion. Initial titration occurred in a monitored inpatient setting; patients were then treated as outpatients for a total of 30 days. The primary end point was the change in serum sodium concentration from baseline to day 7. Lixivaptan significantly increased the serum sodium concentration from baseline to day 7 (the primary end point) by 6.7 mmol/l compared with placebo (4.5 mmol/l; P = 0.034). Importantly, the serum sodium concentration was normalized safely and more rapidly in patients receiving lixivaptan than placebo (P = 0.004) and was well tolerated. After drug discontinuation, serum sodium concentrations decreased to near-baseline levels within 7 days. Thus, lixivaptan safely and effectively corrects serum sodium concentrations in patients with euvolemic hyponatremia.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^116JUkNn]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Practice Guidelines

After weighing the evidence, the European Clinical Practice Guidelines recommended that correction of hyponatremia be limited to 10 mmol/L in the first day of treatment and 8 mmol/L for every subsequent day thereafter. An expert panel that included six physicians from the United States and one from Ireland (which we will call the "US/Irish expert panel") came to similar conclusions, but with some added nuance (expressed in italics). For chronically hyponatremic patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L (for example, outpatients drinking conventional volumes of water or treated with thiazides and hospital-acquired hyponatremia with a known duration > 48 hours) who were at normal risk of developing osmotic demyelination, the panel recommended a correction limit of 10–12 mmol/L in any 24-hour period and 18 mmol/L in any 48-hour period and a minimum correction of 4–8 mmol/L. The panel recommended increased vigilance for patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L at heightened risk of osmotic demyelination. Factors reported to be associated with a higher risk of osmotic demyelination include sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L, alcohol use disorder, hypokalemia, malnutrition, or advanced liver disease. In these high-risk patients, the US/Irish expert panel recommended that correction should not exceed 8 mmol/L in any 24-hour period and that the minimum daily correction goal should be 4–6 mmol/L. In patients without major risk factors for osmotic demyelination, the panel noted that correction by 8–12 mmol/L in the first day of therapy was greater than necessary, but unlikely to cause harm as long as the 2-day increment does not exceed 18 mmol/L.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^114bTxzD]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

International guidelines designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia have been widely accepted for a decade. On the basis of the results of a recent large retrospective study of patients hospitalized with hyponatremia, it has been suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of rise of the serum sodium concentration; the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration has been questioned. These assertions are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago. After reviewing the history of that controversy, the evidence supporting the guidelines, and the validity of data challenging them, we conclude that current safeguards should not be abandoned. To do so would be akin to discarding your umbrella because you remained dry in a rainstorm. The authors of this review, who represent 20 medical centers in nine countries, have all contributed significantly to the literature on the subject. We urge clinicians to continue to treat severe hyponatremia cautiously and to wait for better evidence before adopting less stringent therapeutic limits.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^111hiyrd]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For the past decade, most physicians treating severe hyponatremia have followed international guidelines that recommend limiting the rate of correction to avoid serious iatrogenic neurologic complications, most notably osmotic demyelination. Although these guidelines are based on small retrospective case series, they have been widely accepted by expert clinicians and are designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia. – Established practice has recently been challenged by the publication of a retrospective analysis of hospital administrative data derived from a cohort of over 17,000 patients hospitalized with hyponatremia. On the basis of the results of that study, an accompanying editorial suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of correction; its authors questioned the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration. We believe such conclusions are unwarranted and potentially dangerous; they are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago. A review of that controversy, and of how current guidelines came to be, will explain the reason for our position.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of exercise-associated hyponatremia: 2019 update [^114s47wM]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to patients with exercise-associated hyponatremia (inpatient management), WMS 2020 guidelines recommend to avoid administering oral and IV hypotonic or isotonic fluids early in the management of patients with exercise-associated hyponatremia, although, consider using in certain clinical contexts once sodium correction has been initiated or hypovolemia is confirmed.

### The challenge of hyponatremia [^116yEj9k]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of hypotonic hyponatremia often challenges clinicians on many counts. Despite similar serum sodium concentrations, clinical manifestations can range from mild to life threatening. Some patients require active management, whereas others recover without intervention. Therapeutic measures frequently yield safe correction, yet the same measures can result in osmotic demyelination. To address this challenge, we present a practical approach to managing hyponatremia that centers on two elements: a diagnostic evaluation directed at the pathogenesis and putative causes of hyponatremia, the case-specific clinical and laboratory features, and the associated clinical risk; and a management plan tailored to the diagnostic findings that incorporates quantitative projections of fluid therapy and fluid losses on the patient's serum sodium, balances potential benefits and risks, and emphasizes vigilant monitoring. These principles should enable the clinician to formulate a management plan that addresses expeditiously three critical questions: Which of the determinants of the serum sodium are deranged and what is the underlying culprit? How urgent is the need for intervention? What specific therapy should be instituted and which are the associated pitfalls?

Regarding specific circumstances for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to patients with exercise-associated hyponatremia (outpatient management), WMS 2020 guidelines recommend to consider adding oral sodium in hypertonic solutions or advising foods with high sodium content (salty snacks) for increasing serum sodium levels and enhancing symptom relief (over fluid restriction) in patients with mild exercise-associated hyponatremia, if tolerated.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to patients with exercise-associated hyponatremia (outpatient management), WMS 2020 guidelines recommend to advise restricting oral fluids if exercise-associated hyponatremia from fluid overload is associated with mild symptoms.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^116Dh6zX]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in clinical medicine; it represents an excess of water relative to total body solute. Hyponatremia usually results from the intake and subsequent retention of electrolyte-free water in response to true hypovolemia due to gastrointestinal solute loss or malnutrition; decreased effective circulating volume due to heart failure or liver cirrhosis; or non-osmotic vasopressin activity due to malignancies, infections, medications, pain, or stress. When defined as a serum sodium concentration below 135 mmol/L, hyponatremia occurs in up to 8% of the general population and in up to 60% of hospitalized patients. Acute profound hyponatremia can cause brain edema, but also chronic mild hyponatremia is associated with poor health outcomes. Even when comorbid conditions are taken into account, people with a mildly decreased serum sodium concentration have a 30% higher risk of death and are hospitalized 14% longer relative to those without hyponatremia.

Despite the frequency and severity of some of the associated complications, research suggests hyponatremia is often neglected by clinicians. If acquired in hospital, it may take days before the electrolyte disorder is investigated, potentially allowing a further decrease in serum sodium concentration and exposing patients to the dangers of profound hyponatremia. When efforts are made to explore the underlying cause, clinicians use widely different strategies for differential diagnosis, testing is often inadequate and misclassification of the hyponatremia frequently occurs.

Hyponatremia may be managed clinically by different specialists, such as endocrinologists, nephrologists, geriatricians, or intensivists, and, accordingly, management strategies often vary. Although probably related to variation in awareness, differences in expert opinion on whom and how to treat only add to the confusion over optimal management. For instance, although experts agree that acute symptomatic hyponatremia should be treated with hypertonic saline, the optimal concentrations and methods for determining initial infusion speeds are debated. In addition, the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome after rapid correction of hyponatremia has fuelled intense debate among experts on whether complications of untreated hyponatremia or complications of treatment pose the greatest risk. As different specialist physicians deal with hyponatremia, consultation of different information and guidance sources may add to the variability in treatment seen in clinical practice today.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^114CwAdv]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hypotonic hyponatraemia (serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L with low osmolality) is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalised adult patients. The diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia may be complex, costly, and controversial. Hyponatraemia has diverse aetiologies and is additionally defined clinically by its duration, "acute" (< 48 hours) versus "chronic" (> 48 hours), and by the presence or absence of symptoms. Management can be challenging particularly in the emergency setting where different treatment options may help or indeed harm individual patients. It is perhaps surprising that management of this electrolyte disorder has a limited evidence base in part due to the paucity of high quality randomised controlled trials. Multiple clinical practice and consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia have been published by local, national, and international organisations. These guidelines represent genuine efforts to address the diagnostic challenges and controversies in its management, particularly in relation to the rate of correction for the serum sodium concentration. The systematic review by Nagler et al. reviewing the quality of recent published guidelines and consensus statements for diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia, has highlighted important variations in both their development and recommendations.

### Vasopressin receptor antagonists for the treatment of hyponatremia: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112L24Fh]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia, the effect of vasopressin antagonists is yet undefined.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Setting & Population

In- and outpatients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia.

Selection Criteria For Studies

We included all RCTs regardless of publication status or language.

Intervention

Vasopressin antagonists with or without fluid restriction versus placebo or no treatment with or without fluid restriction.

Outcomes

Response rate defined as normalization of serum sodium level or significant increase in serum sodium level at 3–7 days (primary) and later, change from baseline serum sodium level at 3–7 days and later, adverse events, rate of rapid sodium level correction, and rate of hypernatremia.

Results

15 RCTs were identified. Vasopressin antagonist treatment significantly increased response rate both early (RR, 3.15; 95% CI, 2.27–4.37; 11 trials) and late (RR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.79–2.89; 4 trials). Response rates were high in trials assessing mostly euvolemic patients and those assessing mostly hypervolemic patients, with greater effect estimate in the former. Change from baseline serum sodium level was significantly increased both early (weighted mean difference, 5.27 mEq/L; 95% CI, 4.27–6.26, 13 trials) and late (weighted mean difference, 3.49 mEq/L; 95% CI, 2.56–4.41, 8 trials). Although there was an increased rate of rapid sodium correction (RR, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.26–5.08, 8 trials) with vasopressin antagonists, hypernatremia rates were not significantly higher (RR, 2.21; 95% CI, 0.61–7.96; 5 trials), adverse events were not increased, and there were no reports of osmotic demyelination syndrome.

Limitations

Significant heterogeneity in the primary outcome.

Conclusions

Vasopressin antagonists are effective for the treatment of hypervolemic and euvolemic hyponatremia.

### Clinical factors associated with hyponatremia correction during treatment with oral urea [^112NjGpe]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition to the identification of factors associated with hyponatremia correction, this study also gives a useful impression of how oral urea is currently positioned in the treatment of hyponatremia.

The majority of patients first received fluid restriction, indicating that oral urea is typically started as second-line treatment, which is in line with the guidelines. When oral urea was started, it was usually combined with fluid restriction and this combination led to a greater rise of plasma sodium during the first 2 days of treatment. Fluid restriction was likely not identified in the main analysis because fluid restriction was frequently liberalized during treatment. Garrahy and colleagues also showed that the effect of fluid restriction plateaus after a couple of days. For clinical practice it would be relevant to know whether oral urea should always be combined with fluid restriction or whether it can also be given as first-line treatment without fluid restriction. A previous retrospective study analyzed the effects of oral urea as first-line treatment without fluid restriction in cancer patients with SIAD-induced hyponatremia. The correction rate in this previous study was in fact higher (5 mmol/L in 24 h), which may be attributable to the lower baseline plasma sodium (123 mmol/L) or low solute intake in patients with cancer. In another recent study, oral urea was also given without fluid restriction and produced a more modest rise in plasma sodium (2 mmol/L in 7 days). However, this study was performed in an ambulatory setting in which transient causes for AVP release are less common than in hospitalized patients; patients also had a higher baseline plasma sodium (132 mmol/L). To address this issue more conclusively, a randomized controlled trial comparing oral urea with or without fluid restriction would be desirable.

### Risk factors and outcomes of rapid correction of severe hyponatremia [^11468TJw]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Rapid correction of severe hyponatremia can result in serious neurologic complications, including osmotic demyelination. Few data exist on incidence and risk factors of rapid correction or osmotic demyelination.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

In a retrospective cohort of 1490 patients admitted with serum sodium < 120 mEq/L to seven hospitals in the Geisinger Health System from 2001 to 2017, we examined the incidence and risk factors of rapid correction and osmotic demyelination. Rapid correction was defined as serum sodium increase of > 8 mEq/L at 24 hours. Osmotic demyelination was determined by manual chart review of all available brain magnetic resonance imaging reports.

Results

Mean age was 66 years old (SD = 15), 55% were women, and 67% had prior hyponatremia (last outpatient sodium < 135 mEq/L). Median change in serum sodium at 24 hours was 6.8 mEq/L (interquartile range, 3.4–10.2), and 606 patients (41%) had rapid correction at 24 hours. Younger age, being a woman, schizophrenia, lower Charlson comorbidity index, lower presentation serum sodium, and urine sodium < 30 mEq/L were associated with greater risk of rapid correction. Prior hyponatremia, outpatient aldosterone antagonist use, and treatment at an academic center were associated with lower risk of rapid correction. A total of 295 (20%) patients underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging on or after admission, with nine (0.6%) patients showing radiologic evidence of osmotic demyelination. Eight (0.5%) patients had incident osmotic demyelination, of whom five (63%) had beer potomania, five (63%) had hypokalemia, and seven (88%) had sodium increase > 8 mEq/L over a 24-hour period before magnetic resonance imaging. Five patients with osmotic demyelination had apparent neurologic recovery.

Conclusions

Among patients presenting with severe hyponatremia, rapid correction occurred in 41%; nearly all patients with incident osmotic demyelination had a documented episode of rapid correction.

### Criteria for hyponatremic overcorrection: systematic review and cohort study of emergently ill patients [^113evMLF]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disturbance amongst hospitalized patients. An overly rapid rate of correction of chronic hyponatremia is believed to increase the risk of poor clinical outcomes including osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). There is disagreement in the literature regarding the definition of hyponatremic overcorrection.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of all English language studies to identify those that calculated sodium correction rate and classified patients' overcorrection status. We then identified all patients who presented to our hospital's emergency department between 2003 and 2015 with a corrected serum sodium ≤ 116 mmol/L. All methods from the systematic review for sodium correction rate calculation and overcorrection status were applied to this cohort.

Results

We identified 24 studies citing 9 distinct sodium correction rate methods and 14 criteria for overcorrection. Six hundred twenty-four patients presenting with severe hyponatremia (median initial value 113 mMol) were identified. Depending on the method used, the median sodium correction rates in our cohort ranged from 0.271 to 1.13 mmol/L per hour. The proportion of patients classified with overcorrection with the different criteria varied almost 11-fold, ranging from 8.5 to 89.9%.

Conclusion

Published methods disagree regarding the calculation of sodium correction rates and the definition of hyponatremic overcorrection. This leads to wide variations in sodium correction rates and the prevalence of overcorrection in patient cohorts. Definitions based on ODS risk are needed.

### A clinical approach to the treatment of chronic hypernatremia [^111Jhniq]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Hypernatremia is a commonly encountered electrolyte disorder occurring in both the inpatient and outpatient settings. Community-acquired hypernatremia typically occurs at the extremes of age, whereas hospital-acquired hypernatremia affects patients of all age groups. Serum sodium concentration is linked to water homeostasis, which is dependent on the thirst mechanism, arginine vasopressin, and kidney function. Because both hypernatremia and the rate of correction of hypernatremia are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, prompt effective treatment is crucial. Chronic hypernatremia can be classified into 3 broad categories, hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic forms, with each form having unique treatment considerations. In this teaching case, we provide a clinically based quantitative approach to the treatment of both hypervolemic and hypovolemic hypernatremia, which occurred in the same patient during the course of a prolonged illness.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^113XpNxi]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Epidemiology of Hyponatremia and Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuresis

The frequency of hyponatremia depends on the definition used, clinical setting, and population studied, but is generally reported to affect 15% to 30% of acute hospital patients to some degree. Studies reporting rates at the lower end of this range tend to include admission values only and more restrictive sodium inclusion criteria (eg, pNa < 133–135 mmol/L), whereas rates at the higher end consider the whole hospital stay and use broader criteria (eg, < 136–138 mmol/L). Table 2 summarizes large, predominantly retrospective, studies of hyponatremia prevalence in the inpatient and outpatient setting. Many factors relevant to hospitalization can promote antidiuresis via stimulation of AVP (including stress-related factors such as pain and nausea); other contributors may include medications (eg, diuretics), hypotonic fluid administration, or reduction in heart, kidney, or liver function.

### Exercise-associated hyponatremia: updated guidelines… [^113KnqfC]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- EAH risk can be reduced by limiting drinking only to respond to thirst with prolonged exertion.
- Because EAH and heat illness symptoms overlap, rectal temperature measurement is critical when assessing altered mental status associated with prolonged exertion.
- Severe EAH is best treated with hypertonic saline boluses. Aggressive cooling can be added if heat illness is also suspected.
- Mild EAH is treated with fluid restriction and oral hypertonic solutions, or salty foods can be added. From the AFP Editors Exercise-associated hyponatremia occurs when exertion results in sodium concentration less than 135 mEq per L, and symptoms can present up to 24 hours after physical activity. When asymptomatic ultramarathon participants are screened, up to one-half demonstrate hyponatremia. The usual cause of EAH is overhydration with hypotonic fluids such as water or sports drinks.

SEVERE EAH Severe EAH should be assumed when mental status changes are noted with normal or minimally elevated rectal temperatures. Severe EAH should be rapidly treated with 100-mL intravenous boluses of hypertonic saline, which may be repeated every 10 minutes for three total boluses. These doses increase serum sodium by up to 2 mEq per L and do not increase risk of osmotic demyelination. If heat illness is suspected with EAH or the diagnosis is uncertain, hypertonic saline boluses can be combined with rapid cooling. Hypotonic fluids should be avoided in EAH to prevent pulmonary edema. Further hypertonic saline treatment can be considered if necessary. Large hypertonic saline volumes have been used without adverse effects, including 600 mL over one hour and 950 mL over seven hours. MILD EAH Mild EAH often manifests as bloating, weight gain, and lack of orthostasis. Fluid restriction is the primary treatment until significant diuresis occurs.

External cooling can be added, and intravenous hypotonic or isotonic fluid should be avoided. In mild EAH, salt can be replaced through oral hypertonic solutions such as three to four bouillon cubes or three ramen seasoning packets per 125 mL of water, or by consumption of salty foods. Intravenous hypertonic saline may be used if anti-emetics are ineffective in enabling oral intake.

### The feasibility of emergency department observation units in the management of mild to moderate hyponatremia [^1173A4ST]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe the feasibility of managing hyponatremia patients under outpatient observation status in an academic medical center, and compare outcomes based on the use of an emergency department observation unit (EDOU).

Methods

This is a retrospective cohort study of emergency department hyponatremic patients managed in four hospitals within a large urban academic medical center over 27 months. All patients had an admit-to-observation order, ICD-10 codes for hyponatremia, and mild (130–135 mmol/L) to moderate (121–129 mmol/L) hyponatremia. Observation settings were divided into two groups: EDOU and Non-Observation Unit (NOU) inpatient beds. Severe hyponatremia (≤ 120 mmol/L) was excluded. Primary clinical outcomes were inpatient admit rate, length of stay (LOS), total direct cost, the rate of adverse events and 30-day recidivism.

Results

188 patients were managed as an observation patient, with 64 managed in an EDOU setting (age 74.0 yr, 70.3% female) and 124 managed in a NOU setting (age 71.5 yr, 64.5% female). Patient subgroups were similar in terms of presenting complaints, comorbidities, and medication histories. Initial and final sodium levels were similar between settings: EDOU (125.1 to 132.6 mmol/L) vs NOU (123.5 to 132.0 mmol/L). However, outcomes differed by setting for observation to inpatient admit rate (EDOU 28.1% vs NOU 37.9%, adjusted effect 0.70), overall length of stay (EDOU 19.2 h vs NOU 31.9 h; adjusted effect -10.5 h and total direct cost ($1230 vs $1531; adjusted effect -$167). EDOU sodium correction rates were faster (EDOU 0.44 mmol/L/h vs 0.24 mmol/L/h; adjusted effect 0.15 mmol/L/h) and 30-day recidivism rate was similar (EDOU 13% vs NOU 15%). There were no index visit deaths or intensive care unit admissions.

Conclusion

Management of selected hyponatremia patients under observation status is feasible, with the EDOU setting demonstrating lower admit rates, shorter length of stay, and lower total direct costs with similar clinical outcomes.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to management of overly rapid correction, ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to consider administering an infusion of 10 mL/kg body weight of electrolyte-free water (such as glucose solutions) over 1 hour, in consultation with an expert and under strict monitoring of urine output and fluid balance.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^116NqJCy]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Current international hyponatremia guidelines differ in their recommendations regarding the use of tolvaptan. US expert panel recommendations, while acknowledging insufficient evidence for tolvaptan use with serum sodium less than 120 mmol/L, endorse its use as a second-line treatment, with appropriate monitoring and prompt intervention if the recommended rate of serum sodium increase is exceeded, and even raise the possibility that it may be a potential first-line therapy option in the future. European guidelines, however, recommend against the use of tolvaptan in moderate-profound hyponatremia, primarily out of concern regarding the potential risk of excessively rapid serum sodium correction. Other potential concerns raised about tolvaptan include cost and risk of liver function derangement seen with sustained higher-dose tolvaptan therapy used for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (up to 120 mg daily). A US FDA safety notice was issued in 2013 limiting the use of tolvaptan in hyponatremia to less than 30 days' duration, and removing the indication for patients with cirrhosis. Safe long-term tolvaptan use for up to 4 years has been reported in 111 participants in the SALTWATER trial (the SALT trial extension study), though 1 patient with cirrhosis developed hepatorenal syndrome and died, which was considered "possibly related" to tolvaptan use. So far, there are no reported cases of liver dysfunction directly attributed to the lower doses and typically short durations of tolvaptan in SIAD.

We use tolvaptan as a second-line therapy in selected inpatients and occasional outpatients with SIAD, typically when refractory to FR. Safety information recommends initiation and reinitiation in the hospital to allow monitoring. Careful patient selection is important, plus close monitoring of serum sodium and urine output, readiness to administer IV dextrose if correction targets are exceeded, and daily reevaluation of each dose. Based on existing evidence and clinical experience, we have developed the following recommendations for tolvaptan use (Table 8), which form the basis of an inpatient RCT protocol that is currently underway (ACTRN12619001683123), aiming to provide a prospective evidence base to evaluate these recommendations. We use tolvaptan less frequently in outpatients because of the product information recommending against long-term use, high cost, and limited monitoring capacity — in this situation we prefer oral urea.

Table 6.
Randomized controlled trials in management of chronic hypotonic hyponatremia

Current guideline-directed management of hyponatremia is largely based on expert opinion and is expected to evolve with new evidence over the coming years. Trials are currently in progress comparing protocolized low-dose tolvaptan vs FR in SIAD, and evaluating empagliflozin in inpatients and outpatients with euvolemic and hypervolemic chronic hyponatremia (NCT04447911). Despite controversies in approach, there is retrospective evidence that active management of inpatients with hyponatremia by specialist physicians (endocrinologists or nephrologists, depending on local practice) may improve mortality and reduce length of hospital stay. This was reported in an audit of a single Irish center over a 5-year period from 2005 to 2010, that found increasing rates of specialist referral (32%-68%) and use of active hyponatremia management strategies for pNa less than 120 mmol/L (63%-88%) was associated with a 91% reduction in mortality risk (P < .001). A UK single-center study compared 18 individuals with hyponatremia less than 127 mmol/L (mean pNa 120.7 mmol/L) who received prompt endocrine specialist input with 23 historical controls (mean Na 124.1 mmol/L), observing faster time to achieving a sodium increase of 5 mmol/L or greater (3.5 days vs 7.1 days; P = 0.005), and reduced length of stay in the intervention group (10.9 vs 14.5 days; P = 0.004). A large Swiss multicenter international RCT, currently recruiting, has been designed to definitively evaluate the hypothesis that correction of hyponatremia in hospitalized patients reduces the risk of death or rehospitalization (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03557957).

It is worth noting that chronic mild-moderate hyponatremia due to a reset osmostat may not be amenable to correction when compared to other causes of SIAD — as due to increased thirst above the new osmotic set point, FR, and other therapies are unlikely to be effective.

Potential treatments for hyponatremia in SIAD are discussed and evaluated next, and a proposed management algorithm based on best available current evidence is summarized in Fig. 10.

### Correction and prevention of hyponatremia in patients with cirrhosis and ascites: post hoc analysis of the ANSWER study database [^111U8ry2]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

We assessed the impact of long-term albumin administration to hyponatremic patients with ascites enrolled in the ANSWER trial.

Methods

The normalization rate of baseline hyponatremia and the 18-month incidence rate of at least moderate hyponatremia were evaluated.

Results

The hyponatremia normalization rate was higher with albumin than with standard medical treatment (45% vs 28%, P = 0.042 at 1 month). Long-term albumin ensured a lower incidence of at least moderate hyponatremia than standard medical treatment (incidence rate ratio: 0.245 [CI 0.167–0.359], P < 0.001).

Discussion

Long-term albumin administration improves hyponatremia and reduces episodes of at least moderate hyponatremia in outpatients with cirrhosis and ascites.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hyponatremia: expert panel recommendations [^111WX8Kf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a serious, but often overlooked, electrolyte imbalance that has been independently associated with a wide range of deleterious changes involving many different body systems. Untreated acute hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality as a result of osmotically induced cerebral edema, and excessively rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic impairment and death as a result of osmotic demyelination. The diverse etiologies and comorbidities associated with hyponatremia pose substantial challenges in managing this disorder. In 2007, a panel of experts in hyponatremia convened to develop the Hyponatremia Treatment Guidelines 2007: Expert Panel Recommendations that defined strategies for clinicians caring for patients with hyponatremia. In the 6 years since the publication of that document, the field has seen several notable developments, including new evidence on morbidities and complications associated with hyponatremia, the importance of treating mild to moderate hyponatremia, and the efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonist therapy for hyponatremic patients. Therefore, additional guidance was deemed necessary and a panel of hyponatremia experts (which included all of the original panel members) was convened to update the previous recommendations for optimal current management of this disorder. The updated expert panel recommendations in this document represent recommended approaches for multiple etiologies of hyponatremia that are based on both consensus opinions of experts in hyponatremia and the most recent published data in this field.

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte abnormality affecting hospitalized patients. 1 It is an independent predictor for mortality and is associated with increased length of hospital stay and higher costs. The most serious potential complication is hyponatremic encephalopathy, a medical emergency that can result in death or irreversible brain injury if inadequately treated. 2 Hypertonic saline is a safe and effective means of correcting hyponatremia. 2–4 A rare yet serious complication from excessive correction of chronic hyponatremia is the development of cerebral demyelination.

### Correction rates and clinical outcomes in hospitalized adults with severe hyponatremia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1147wBVW]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Hyponatremia treatment guidelines recommend limiting the correction of severe hyponatremia during the first 24 hours to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). Recent evidence suggests that slower rates of correction are associated with increased mortality.

Objective

To evaluate the association of sodium correction rates with mortality among hospitalized adults with severe hyponatremia.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, LILACS, Web of Science, CINAHL, and international congress proceedings for studies published between January 2013 and October 2023.

Study Selection

Comparative studies assessing rapid (≥ 8–10 mEq/L per 24 hours) vs slow (< 8 or 6–10 mEq/L per 24 hours) and very slow (< 4–6 mEq/L per 24 hours) correction of severe hyponatremia (serum sodium < 120 mEq/L or < 125 mEq/L plus severe symptoms) in hospitalized patients.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Pairs of reviewers (N. A.F. J.R.M. J.M. A. A.C.) independently reviewed studies, extracted data, and assessed each included study's risk of bias using ROBINS-I. Cochrane methods, PRISMA reporting guidelines, and the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to rate the certainty of evidence were followed. Data were pooled using a random-effects model.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes were in-hospital and 30-day mortality, and secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay (LOS) and ODS.

Results

Sixteen cohort studies involving a total of 11 811 patients with severe hyponatremia were included (mean [SD] age, 68.22 [6.88] years; 56.7% female across 15 studies reporting sex). Moderate-certainty evidence showed that rapid correction was associated with 32 (odds ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.55–0.82) and 221 (odds ratio, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.11–0.79) fewer in-hospital deaths per 1000 treated patients compared with slow and very slow correction, respectively. Low-certainty evidence suggested that rapid correction was associated with 61 (risk ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.45–0.67) and 134 (risk ratio, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.28–0.44) fewer deaths per 1000 treated patients at 30 days and with a reduction in LOS of 1.20 (95% CI, 0.51–1.89) and 3.09 (95% CI, 1.21–4.94) days, compared with slow and very slow correction, respectively. Rapid correction was not associated with a statistically significant increased risk of ODS.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, slow correction and very slow correction of severe hyponatremia were associated with an increased risk of mortality and hospital LOS compared to rapid correction.

### Association of hyponatremia with bone mineral density and fractures: a narrative review [^112TeqqA]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Second, preliminary data, showing early improvement of BTMs after correction of hyponatremia, highlight the need to evaluate the short- and long-term impact of sodium normalization on bone metabolism with the use of BTMs. These studies using BTMs, not only will require shorter follow-up than BMD studies because of their ability to detect changes much earlier, but also will shine more light on the bone remodelling processes. We suggest that these studies should recruit ambulatory outpatients with chronic hyponatremia in order to minimize the effects of confounding variables, such as immobility and illness-related hypercortisolaemia, which have a well-known strong negative impact on bone metabolism with a shift towards bone resorption.

Third, it is also worth exploring and comparing the effect of various pharmacotherapies for hyponatremia due to SIADH on BMD and BTMs. Besides their bone effect through changes in serum sodium, these agents per se may impact bone metabolism. Additionally, emerging data about the role of AVP signalling in bone mass regulation through V1a and V2 receptors in osteoblasts and osteoclasts raise the possibility that a treatment modality for SIADH may affect bone metabolism, at least partially, through AVP changes. Therefore, these studies should include measurement of serum copeptin, an excellent surrogate marker for AVP. These studies should include in one arm tolvaptan, a selective AVP antagonist with direct action on AVP receptors and high efficacy in restoring hyponatremia, which is the only medication currently approved by the regulatory authorities for the treatment of euvolaemic hyponatremia. Studies should also include the other main treatment modalities: fluid restriction which has been the first-line treatment of SIADH for decades; urea which is recommended as the second-line therapy for SIADH by the European guidelines; empagliflozin, an SGLT-2 inhibitor, which is widely available as antidiabetic medication and has recently emerged as a promising treatment option for both short-term use in hospitalized patients with SIADHand long-term use in outpatients with chronic SIADH.

### Overcorrection of hyponatremia is a medical emergency [^112nVQKK]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Overcorrection of hyponatremia is a medical emergency. Excessive correction usually results from the unexpected emergence of a water diuresis after resolution of the cause of water retention. The concurrent administration of desmopressin and 5% dextrose in water can be given to cautiously re-lower the serum sodium concentration when therapeutic limits have been exceeded. Nephrologists should be equally aggressive in correcting hyponatremia and in un-correcting it when their patients get too much of a good thing.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia [^111V9Y4A]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with severe (serum sodium ≤ 120 mEq/L), symptomatic hyponatremia can develop life-threatening or fatal complications from cerebral edema if treatment is inadequate and permanent neurologic disability from osmotic demyelination if treatment is excessive. Unfortunately, as is true of all electrolyte disturbances, there are no randomized trials to guide the treatment of this challenging disorder. Rather, therapeutic decisions rest on physiologic principles, animal models, observational studies, and single-patient reports. European guidelines and recommendations of an American Expert panel have come to similar conclusions on how much correction of hyponatremia is enough and how much is too much, but there are important differences. We review the evidence supporting these recommendations, identifying areas that rest on relatively solid ground and highlighting areas in greatest need of additional data.

### An increase in plasma sodium levels is associated with an increase in osteoblast function in chronic SIAD [^115URm2t]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

The main strength of our study relies in its crossover and double-blind design. However, several limitations should be mentioned. First, our sample size (n = 11) and the average sodium change (from 131 to 134 mmol/l) are modest, which might negate meaningful findings for osteocalcin and CTX. Second, although the P1NP/CTX ratio used for the primary end point has been used in our previous study and by others, it is not broadly established and has never been shown to correlate with BMD. Further studies should include BMD measurement with dual-energy x-ray densitometry and comprise a longer observation period. This would allow us to investigate the relationship between hyponatremia duration and BMD at baseline, taking into account that retrospective data suggest an increased risk for osteoporosis with hyponatremia duration. Reliable diagnosis of osteoporosis in all study patients would be important, given that one case report describes osteoporosis recovery in a patient after the resolution of a paraneoplastic SIAD.

Conclusion

An increase in plasma sodium levels in outpatients with chronic hyponatremia due to SIAD, even when mild, was associated with an increase in BFI (P1NP/CTX) triggered by an increase in P1NP, a surrogate marker of osteoblast function. The long-term effect of sodium correction on bone health in patients with chronic hyponatremia needs further research.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^1174Gy8M]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatraemia is a common electrolyte disorder associated with significant complications and controversies regarding its optimal management. Clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements have attempted to provide clinicians with evidence-based diagnostic and treatment strategies for hyponatraemia. Recently published guidance documents differ in their methods employed to review the quality of available evidence. Nagler et al. used the Appraisal of Guideline for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument in a systematic review of guidelines and consensus statements for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia. Nagler and colleagues highlighted the variability in methodological rigour applied to guideline development and inconsistencies between publications in relation to management of hyponatraemia (including the recommended rate of correction of a low serum sodium concentration). These differences could cause confusion for practising physicians managing patients with hyponatraemia. Please see related article: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/12/231.

### An increase in plasma sodium levels is associated with an increase in osteoblast function in chronic SIAD [^111Q37UA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in clinical practice. Chronic hyponatremia is associated with increased mortality and morbidity, including an increased risk for osteoporosis and fractures. Both the risk for osteoporosis and the risk for fragility fractures increase with hyponatremia severity and duration. Bones represent the biggest pool of mobilizable osmotically inactive sodium, thus hyponatremia-mediated bone destruction is evolutionary plausible. This hypothesis is supported by the in vitro activation of osteoclasts in a hyponatremic environment, and by histological bone loss and reduced bone sodium content in hyponatremic rats.

In humans, the use of biochemical markers of bone turnover allows noninvasive assessment of bone metabolism. Procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP), a byproduct of type I collagen synthesis, and osteocalcin, a marker of bone mineralization, are indicators of bone formation and osteoblast function, while serum cross-linked C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX) is a widely used marker of osteoclast-dependent bone resorption.

In 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, we have demonstrated that the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin is a promising treatment option in patients with a syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD), first over 4 days in hospitalized patients and more recently over 4 weeks in outpatients with chronic SIAD. In a post hoc analysis of our 4-day trial in hospitalized patients, P1NP/CTX remained stable and P1NP increased in patients in whom hyponatremia was corrected, whereas P1NP/CTX decreased and P1NP remained stable if hyponatremia persisted. CTX increased in all patients but all of them were hospitalized, so this might have been attributable to immobilization. To circumvent this limitation, we now performed a predefined secondary analysis of our trial in 14 outpatients with chronic SIAD. We hypothesized that an increase in plasma sodium levels would be associated with an increase in osteoblast markers and the bone formation index (BFI), and with a decrease in osteoclasts markers, independently of empagliflozin treatment.

### Urea for the treatment of hyponatremia [^112ykbco]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Current therapies for hyponatremia have variable effectiveness and tolerability, and in certain instances, they are very expensive. We examined the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of urea for the treatment of inpatient hyponatremia.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

We identified all patients hospitalized at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center between July 2016 and August 2017 with hyponatremia (plasma sodium < 135 mEq/L) who received urea, including a subgroup of patients who received urea as the sole drug therapy for hyponatremia (urea-only treated). We matched urea only-treated patients to a group of patients with hyponatremia who did not receive urea (urea untreated) and compared changes in plasma sodium at 24 hours and the end of therapy as well as the proportion of patients who achieved plasma sodium ≥ 135 mEq/L. We abstracted data on adverse events and reported side effects of urea.

Results

Fifty-eight patients received urea (7.5–90 g/d) over a median of 4.5 (interquartile range, 3–8) days and showed an increase in plasma sodium from 124 mEq/L (interquartile range, 122–126) to 131 mEq/L (interquartile range, 127–134; P < 0.001). Among 12 urea only-treated patients, plasma sodium increased from 125 mEq/L (interquartile range, 122–127) to 131 mEq/L (interquartile range, 129–136; P = 0.001) by the end of urea therapy. There was a larger increase in plasma sodium at 24 hours in urea only-treated patients compared with urea-untreated patients (2.5 mEq/L; interquartile range, 0–4.5 versus -0.5 mEq/L; interquartile range, -2.5 to 1.5; P = 0.04), with no difference in change in plasma sodium by the end of therapy (6 mEq/L; interquartile range, 3.5–10 versus 5.5 mEq/L; interquartile range, 3–7.5; P = 0.51). A greater proportion of urea only-treated patients achieved normonatremia, but this difference was not statistically significant (33% versus 8%; P = 0.08). No patients experienced overly rapid correction of plasma sodium, and no serious adverse events were reported.

Conclusions

Urea seems effective and safe for the treatment of inpatient hyponatremia, and it is well tolerated.

### Complications and management of hyponatremia [^113LDB46]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hyponatremia causes significant morbidity, mortality, and disability. This review considers the literature of the past 18 months to improve understanding of these complications and to identify therapeutic strategies to prevent them.

Recent Findings

Acute hyponatremia causes serious brain swelling that can lead to permanent disability or death. A 4-6mEq/l increase in serum sodium is sufficient to reverse impending herniation. Brain swelling is minimal in chronic hyponatremia, and to avoid osmotic demyelination, correction should not exceed 8mEq/l/day. In high-risk patients, correction should not exceed 4-6mEq/l/day. Inadvertent overcorrection of hyponatremia is common and preventable by controlling unwanted urinary water losses with desmopressin. Even mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with increased mortality, attention deficit, gait instability, osteoporosis, and fractures, but it is not known if the correction of mild hyponatremia improves outcomes.

Summary

Controlled trials are needed to identify affordable treatments for hyponatremia that reduce the need for hospitalization, decrease hospital length of stay, and decrease morbidity. Such trials could also help answer the question of whether hyponatremia causes excess mortality or whether it is simply a marker for severe, lethal, underlying disease.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to management of mildly symptomatic patients (chronic setting), ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to consider measuring serum sodium concentration every 6 hours until the serum sodium concentration has stabilized in patients with moderate or profound hyponatremia.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^115yzmgu]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Analytical limitations of serum sodium measurements must also be considered when setting correction goals and limits. Because of unavoidable imprecision, a laboratory report indicating that the serum sodium has increased by 8 mmol/L might, in reality, reflect an increase of 10 mmol/L. For that reason, when planning therapy, the targeted rate of correction should not be too close to rates that can result in patient harm.

Administration of desmopressin (a synthetic antidiuretic hormone) either after or in anticipation of a water diuresis has been used to reverse or prevent inadvertent excessive correction of hyponatremia. Both the European Clinical Practice Guidelines and the US/Irish expert panel suggest that relowering of the serum sodium should be considered if correction limits have been exceeded. However, the approach should depend on the relative risks of injury from excessive correction. The strongest case for relowering the serum sodium to prevent osmotic demyelination can be made in patients at very high risk of developing the disorder (those with a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L or patients with heavy alcohol use, severe hypokalemia, malnutrition, or advanced liver disease). It would be reasonable to relower the serum sodium in such patients if it has increased by > 8 mmol/L in < 24 hours. On the other hand, patients who have rapidly become hyponatremic due to self-induced water intoxication related to psychosis or endurance exercise often develop a spontaneous water diuresis that rapidly brings the serum sodium back to normal; because their risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome is extremely low, the US/Irish expert panel deemed efforts to prevent or reverse excessive correction to be unnecessary. Similarly, in most patients presenting with a sodium > 120 mmol/L, relowering the serum sodium after correction by > 8 mmol/L or even > 12 mmol/L was not recommended. In patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L without major risk factors for osmotic demyelination, initial correction by 8–12 mmol/L is more than necessary, but unlikely to be harmful unless the 48-hours limit of 18 mmol/L is exceeded; the panel deemed relowering of the serum sodium to be optional after correction by > 10–12 mmol/L but recommended that further increases in serum sodium should be avoided for the next 24 hours. Other experts have adopted the stricter limit of 8 mmol/L in 24 hours for all patients.

### Oral lixivaptan effectively increases serum sodium concentrations in outpatients with euvolemic hyponatremia [^1167qqN4]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in clinical practice. Its incidence increases with age and it is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Recently, the vaptans, antagonists of the arginine vasopressin pathway, have shown promise for safe treatment of hyponatremia. Here we evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of oral lixivaptan, a selective vasopressin V2-receptor antagonist, for treatment of nonhospitalized individuals with euvolemic hyponatremia (sodium less than 135 mmol/l) in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III study. About half of the 206 patients were elderly in a chronic care setting. Of these patients, 52 were given a placebo and 154 were given 25–100 mg per day lixivaptan, titrated based on the daily serum sodium measurements. Compared with placebo (0.8 mmol/l), the serum sodium concentration significantly increased by 3.2 mmol/l from baseline to day 7 (primary efficacy endpoint) with lixivaptan treatment. A significantly greater proportion of patients that received lixivaptan achieved normal serum sodium (39.4%) by day 7 relative to placebo (12.2%). Overall, lixivaptan was considered safe and well-tolerated. Thus, oral lixivaptan can be safely initiated in the outpatient setting and effectively increases serum sodium concentrations in outpatients with euvolemic hyponatremia.

### Addressing inpatient hyponatremia through targeted automatic E-consults: a pilot randomized trial [^116WtX6C]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalized patients, with a prevalence of 15–30%. Acute and severe hyponatremia can have dire consequences and must be treated promptly. – Moderate hyponatremia (125–129 mEq/L) is also associated with adverse outcomes and guidelines recommend treatment according to the chronicity and presence of symptoms. Studies across various patient populations have demonstrated improved outcomes after correction of hyponatremia, suggesting that inpatient clinicians should try to correct low sodium values when possible. – Specifically, improvements in plasma sodium are associated with improved gait parameters and reaction times as well as decreased length of stay, 30-day readmissions, hospital costs, and mortality.– Despite this evidence, more than one in three cases of acute-onset hyponatremia is not corrected by the time of hospital discharge. One approach to more consistently correcting hyponatremia in hospitalized patients is to provide expert nephrologist guidance into hyponatremia workup and management. However, specialist resources are limited and such consultations are not routinely obtained.

Targeted automatic e-consultation (TACo) is a model of proactive e-consultation based on automated identification of high-risk patients from the electronic health record (EHR). TACos are triggered by patients' EHR data rather than a consultation request. Once a patient is identified, the consultant is presented with a customized EHR view of pertinent information, and can then choose to provide targeted advice, suggest formal consultation, or neither. The TACo model has been shown to improve clinical outcomes in glucose management, and has been proposed for several other conditions. –

Hyponatremia may be well suited for management through the TACo model, as hyponatremia is common, easily identified via objective criteria in the EHR, often managed suboptimally by primary teams, and may benefit from specialist recommendations for further testing or treatment. However, there have also been concerns raised about TACos, including the feasibility from a workflow and resources standpoint, the possibility that receiving unsolicited management advice may not be acceptable to primary teams, and the potential erosion of clinical expertise if generalists consistently receive specialist input when managing common problems.

The feasibility, acceptability, and clinical effectiveness of targeted, automated e-consults for inpatients with hyponatremia have not been described in the literature. In this pilot randomized trial, we sought to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of TACos for hospitalized patients with hyponatremia. We also assessed the resolution of hyponatremia by discharge among patients receiving TACos and those receiving usual care.

### Addressing inpatient hyponatremia through targeted automatic E-consults: a pilot randomized trial [^115BV4rN]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalized patients. Treatment of hyponatremia is associated with improved outcomes, but more than one in three cases of new onset hyponatremia is not corrected by the time of hospital discharge. Nephrologist input may improve the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, but specialist resources are limited. Targeted automatic electronic consultations (TACos) may be one approach to provide expert nephrologist guidance to the workup and management of hyponatremia using a scalable model.

Objective

Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a TACo intervention for hospitalized patients with hyponatremia.

Design

Single-site, parallel-group cluster randomized trial.

Participants

Adult inpatients with hyponatremia on the hospital medicine service.

Interventions

A nephrologist conducted TACos on intervention patients, making diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations daily (if warranted) until discharge or resolution of hyponatremia.

Main Measures

Measures of feasibility included the number of eligible participants, percentage receiving TACos, number of TACos per participant, and percentage of formal nephrology consults. Acceptability was assessed by a post-intervention survey. Clinical outcomes, including the percentage of hyponatremia cases that resolved by discharge, were also assessed.

Key Results

We identified 62 patients who met inclusion criteria: 38 in the intervention group and 24 in the control group. A nephrologist determined that 26 of 38 intervention patients (68%) would likely benefit from diagnostic and management recommendations; 67 TACos were performed (mean 2.6 per patient). Fourteen of 18 primary team physicians (78%) reported that the e-consults changed their management, and 15 of 18 (83%) wanted TACOs to continue. Resolution of hyponatremia, length of stay, 30-day readmissions, and costs were similar in the intervention and control groups.

Conclusions

Inpatient TACos for hyponatremia were feasible and acceptable to primary teams, and frequently led to changes in diagnosis and management. Further studies are needed to determine the impact of the TACo model on clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness.

### Approach to the patient: "Utility of the copeptin assay" [^117TGcCE]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Utility of Copeptin Measurement in Hyper- and Hyponatremia

Copeptin Measurement in Hypernatremia

While hypernatremia is a rare finding in outpatients, it is much more common in hospitalized patients showing a prevalence of 2% to 3%. Hypernatremia results from a free water deficit due to renal (central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, glycosuria) or extrarenal water loss or from iatrogenic sodium overload (eg, uncontrolled saline infusion, tube feeding). In the majority of hospitalized hypernatremia patients, the electrolyte imbalance is not present at admission, but develops during hospitalization. Besides iatrogenic issues, many other factors and comorbidities such as heart failure, chronic kidney disease, sepsis, neurological impairment with impaired thirst perception, or inability to drink may promote the development of hypernatremia in the acute setting. Hypernatremia is therefore also a marker of disease severity and, unsurprisingly, studies consistently report increased mortality rates in patients with hypernatremia.

The most important measure to correct hypernatremia is to increase the free water supply, such as by intravenous hypotonic infusion. Additionally, in salt-overloaded patients iatrogenic action has to be stopped and diabetes insipidus patients need timely treatment with desmopressin.

The high rate of hospital-acquired hypernatremia underpins insufficient hypernatremia awareness in hospitalized patients, with the result of inadequate treatment and worse outcome. Specifically, for hospitalized patients with diabetes insipidus, a retrospective audit showed that desmopressin treatment was delayed in 88% of patients at admission, putting them at risk of hypernatremia. This prompted the Society for Endocrinology to publish guidelines on in-hospital management of central diabetes insipidus in 2018. For patients with undiagnosed diabetes insipidus who are also at need for early desmopressin treatment, copeptin has been proposed as a readily available diagnostic marker in the acute setting.

### Hyponatremia treatment guidelines 2007: expert panel recommendations [^116MdcXm]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Although hyponatremia is a common, usually mild, and relatively asymptomatic disorder of electrolytes, acute severe hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with concomitant disease. In addition, overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic deficits and death, and optimal treatment strategies for such cases are not established. An expert panel assessed the potential contributions of aquaretic nonpeptide small-molecule arginine vasopressin receptor (AVPR) antagonists to hyponatremia therapies. This review presents their conclusions, including identification of appropriate treatment populations and possible future indications for aquaretic AVPR antagonists.

### Urea for hyponatremia? [^113wC389]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Once the standard of care for cerebral edema, urea can also be used to treat hyponatremia. The 2014 European Clinical Practice Guidelines recommend urea for the treatment of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, while discouraging use of vasopressin antagonists. Although there is evidence that urea can diminish hypertonic injury to brain cells caused by rapid correction of hyponatremia, clinical trials are needed that include patients at high risk to develop complications from overcorrection.

### Dysnatremia, its correction, and mortality in patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy: a prospective observational study [^115L1XVH]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Both hyponatremia and hypernatremia are important risk factors for high morbidity and mortality in several clinical settings. However, reports have conflicted about the dependent and independent relationships of sodium with mortality. A relationship is plausible because both hyponatremia and hypernatremia have adverse consequences via their effects on the brain, heart, and other organs. However, dysnatremia might be only a marker of comorbidities, with deaths attributable mainly to the severity of the diseases and not to dysnatremia itself. A recent review of hyponatremia cases concluded that deaths were associated with the underlying illness, rather than with the severity of hyponatremia. Given the nature of this issue, it is unclear whether the correction of sodium can reduce the mortality risk. Most randomized controlled trials of drugs for sodium correction have not demonstrated a survival advantage. Although these results have not excluded the need for sodium correction, it is necessary to address whether sodium correction alone can reduce mortality. A well-designed observational study could be helpful because randomized controlled trials for this issue are not feasible.

Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is increasingly used in severe acute kidney injury (AKI), because it can easily control biochemical imbalances due to AKI. The presence of AKI or comorbidities hinders the effectiveness of conventional fluid or drug management, but CRRT can overcome these difficulties and achieve normonatremia. Here, we first addressed how sodium levels predict mortality in a prospective cohort of patients receiving CRRT, in whom the control of dysnatremia was extremely difficult with conventional treatment alone. Whether sodium correction is independently associated with reduced mortality in comorbid conditions was also addressed.

### Evaluation and management of hypo-osmolality in hospitalized patients [^1126c3pz]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in the clinical setting. Abnormalities of the mechanisms that maintain normal water and sodium metabolism are often present in hospitalized patients, including defects in renal water excretion. All of the current therapeutic approaches in patients with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion and other forms of vasopressin-induced hyponatremia have significant limitations. Studies in animal models and humans have demonstrated that antagonists of the AVP V2 receptor in the kidney are effective in correcting hyponatremia. These new agents have been termed "aquaretics" because of their ability to induce a free water diuresis without the natriuresis or kaliuresis characteristic of diuretic drugs. When approved for clinical use, selective V2, and possibly also combined V1 + V2 receptor antagonists will be helpful in therapy.

### Diagnosing and treating the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion [^114oZizi]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion is the most common cause of hyponatremia in clinical practice, but current management of hyponatremia and outcomes in patients with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion are not well understood. The objective of the Hyponatremia Registry was to assess the current state of management of hyponatremia due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in diverse hospital settings, specifically which diagnostic and treatment modalities are currently used and how rapidly and reliably they result in an increase in serum sodium concentration ([Na(+)]). A secondary objective was to determine whether treatment choices and outcomes differ across the United States and the European Union.

Methods

The Hyponatremia Registry recorded selected diagnostic measures and use, efficacy, and outcomes of therapy for euvolemic hyponatremia diagnosed clinically as syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in 1524 adult patients with [Na(+)] ≤ 130 mEq/L (1034 from 146 US sites and 490 from 79 EU sites). A subgroup of patients with more rigorously defined syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion via measurement of relevant laboratory parameters was also analyzed.

Results

The most common monotherapy treatments for hyponatremia in syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion were fluid restriction (48%), isotonic (27%) or hypertonic (6%) saline, and tolvaptan (13%); 11% received no active agent. The mean rate of [Na(+)] change (mEq/L/d) was greater for all active therapies than no active treatment. Hypertonic saline and tolvaptan produced the greatest mean rate of [Na(+)] change (interquartile range, both 3.0 [6.0] mEq/L/d) compared with lower interquartile range rates of [Na(+)] change for isotonic saline (1.5 [3.0] mEq/L/d) and fluid restriction (1.0 [2.3] mEq/L/d). The general pattern of responses was similar in both the US and EU cohorts. At discharge, [Na(+)] was < 135 mEq/L in 75% of patients and ≤ 130 mEq/L in 43% of patients. Overly rapid correction occurred in 10.2% of patients.

Conclusions

Current treatment of hyponatremia in syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion often uses therapies with limited efficacy; the most commonly chosen monotherapy treatments, fluid restriction and isotonic saline, failed to increase the serum [Na(+)] by ≥ 5 mEq/L in 55% and 64% of monotherapy treatment episodes, respectively. Appropriate laboratory tests to diagnose syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion were obtained in < 50% of patients; success rates in correcting hyponatremia were significantly higher when such tests were obtained. Few outcome differences were found between the United States and the European Union. A notable exception was hospital length of stay; use of tolvaptan was associated with significantly shorter length of stay in the European Union but not in the United States. Despite the availability of effective therapies, most patients with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion were discharged from the hospital still hyponatremic.

### Current treatment practice and outcomes. report of the hyponatremia registry [^1135qAvS]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Current management practices for hyponatremia (HN) are incompletely understood. The HN Registry has recorded diagnostic measures, utilization, efficacy, and outcomes of therapy for eu- or hypervolemic HN. To better understand current practices, we analyzed data from 3087 adjudicated adult patients in the registry with serum sodium concentration of 130 mEq/l or less from 225 sites in the United States and European Union. Common initial monotherapy treatments were fluid restriction (35%), administration of isotonic (15%) or hypertonic saline (2%), and tolvaptan (5%); 17% received no active agent. Median (interquartile range) mEq/l serum sodium increases during the first day were as follows: no treatment, 1.0 (0.0–4.0); fluid restriction, 2.0 (0.0–4.0); isotonic saline, 3.0 (0.0–5.0); hypertonic saline, 5.0 (1.0–9.0); and tolvaptan, 4.0 (2.0–9.0). Adjusting for initial serum sodium concentration with logistic regression, the relative likelihoods for correction by 5 mEq/l or more (referent, fluid restriction) were 1.60 for hypertonic saline and 2.55 for tolvaptan. At discharge, serum sodium concentration was under 135 mEq/l in 78% of patients and 130 mEq/l or less in 49%. Overly rapid correction occurred in 7.9%. Thus, initial HN treatment often uses maneuvers of limited efficacy. Despite an association with poor outcomes and availability of effective therapy, most patients with HN are discharged from hospital still hyponatremic. Studies to assess short- and long-term benefits of correction of HN with effective therapies are needed.

In conclusion, data reported here from the HN Registry suggest that fluid restriction, the therapy administered most frequently for HN in patients with HF, is relatively ineffective, often results in undercorrection of [Na +], and is similar to no specific therapy for HN. Furthermore, most patients with HN remain hyponatremic at hospital discharge. It remains unknown whether more‐effective correction of [Na +] results in better outcomes for patients with HN hospitalized with acute HF. Given the high prevalence and poorer outcomes of patients with acute HF and HN, however, further research is needed regarding decision making and optimal approaches to effectively correct [Na +] in the inpatient setting.

### Sensitivity of international classification of diseases codes for hyponatremia among commercially insured outpatients in the United States [^114wvLUG]. BMC Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, there has been only one published study of the validity of ICD-9-CM codes for the diagnosis of hyponatremia. Movig et al compared inpatient hospital discharge records with inpatient laboratory data and reported a sensitivity of 30% for even the strictest definition of hyponatremia (≤ 115 mmol/L). Positive predictive value for laboratory results showing serum sodium ≤ 135 mmol/L was 91.7%. The study did not address the validity of coding for hyponatremia outside the inpatient setting. Therefore, we sought to examine the validity of ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes for the identification of hyponatremia in an outpatient managed care population.

### Hypokalemia / hyperkalemia and hyponatremia / hypernatremia [^115uaRV3]. Pediatrics in Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Electrolyte disorders are very common in the pediatric population. Derangements in serum sodium and potassium concentrations are among the most frequently seen given the risk factors and comorbidities unique to children. Pediatricians, in both outpatient and inpatient settings, should be comfortable with the evaluation and initial treatment of disturbances in these electrolyte concentrations. However, to evaluate and treat a child with abnormal serum concentrations of sodium or potassium, it is critical to understand the regulatory physiology that governs osmotic homeostasis and potassium regulation in the body. Comprehension of these basic physiologic processes will allow the provider to uncover the underlying pathology of these electrolyte disturbances and devise an appropriate and safe treatment plan.

Fig. 1
Standardized Therapeutic Protocol of Hyponatremia at Our Institution. Details of the protocol was explained in the methods section. All the patients were evaluated to identify the causes of hyponatremia and received cause-specific treatments. Bolus infusion of 3% hypertonic saline was administered for patients with severe symptoms, until the symptoms improved. DDAVP, desmopressin; D5W, 5% dextrose in water; ECW, extra cellular water; i.v. intravenous injection; p.o. per os; SNa, serum sodium; UK, urine potassium; and UNa, urine sodium

Subsequently, we evaluated the SNa and urine sodium (UNa), urine potassium (UK), and urine output every 2–4 h during the first 48 h. Note that our remarkable degree of monitoring was to ensure safer and uniform treatment throughout the study.

We defined the initial 4-h urine output as "early urine output". We compared the SNa to the total amount of UNa and UK (UNa + UK) to predict the possibility of a subsequent spontaneous increase in the SNa. In case the SNa was ≤ UNa + UK, hyponatremia was assumed not to be corrected spontaneously due to the absence of electrolyte-free water in the urine, and 3% hypertonic saline at a continuous rate of 0.5–1.0 mL/kg/h or diuretics were administered if hyponatremia persisted in the subsequent 4 h. Thus, 3% hypertonic saline was administered to patients with reduced ECW, and diuretics such as loop diuretics or tolvaptan were administered to patients without reduced ECW. Administration of 3% hypertonic saline was continued at 0.5–1.0 mL/kg/h until the SNa improved. We used this relatively aggressive protocol to avoid under-treatment, based on evidence that even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in both hospitalized and ambulatory patients.

### Derivation and validation of a novel risk score to predict overcorrection of severe hyponatremia: the severe hyponatremia overcorrection risk (SHOR) score [^1139RKVx]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Osmotic demyelination syndrome is the most concerning complication of severe hyponatremia, occurring with an overly rapid rate of serum sodium correction. There are limited clinical tools to aid in identifying individuals at high risk of overcorrection with severe hyponatremia.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

We identified all patients who presented to a tertiary-care hospital emergency department in Ottawa, Canada (catchment area 1.2 million) between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2015, with serum sodium (corrected for glucose levels) < 116 mmol/L. Overcorrection was determined using 14 published criteria. Latent class analysis measured the independent association of baseline factors with a consensus overcorrection status on the basis of the 14 criteria, and was summarized as a risk score, which was validated in two cohorts.

Results

A total of 623 patients presented with severe hyponatremia (mean initial value 112 mmol/L; SD 3.2). The prevalence of no, unlikely, possible, and definite overcorrection was 72%, 4%, 10%, and 14%, respectively. Overcorrection was independently associated with decreased level of consciousness (2 points), vomiting (2 points), severe hypokalemia (1 point), hypotonic urine (4 points), volume overload (-5 points), chest tumor (-5 points), patient age (-1 point per decade, over 50 years), and initial sodium level (< 110 mmol/L: 4 points; 110–111 mmol/L: 2 points; 112–113 mmol/L: 1 point). These points were summed to create the Severe Hyponatremic Overcorrection Risk (SHOR) score, which was significantly associated with overcorrection status (Spearman correlation 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.49) and was discriminating (average dichotomized c -statistic 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.73 to 0.81). The internal (n = 119) and external (n = 95) validation cohorts had significantly greater use of desmopressin, which was significantly associated with the SHOR score. The SHOR score was significantly associated with overcorrection status in the internal (P < 0.001) but not external (P = 0.39) validation cohort.

Conclusions

In patients presenting with severe hyponatremia, overcorrection was common and predictable using baseline information. Further external validation of the SHOR is required before generalized use.

### Euvolemic hyponatremia in cancer patients. report of the hyponatremia registry: an observational multicenter international study [^114FMjeQ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

The Hyponatremia Registry has a number of limitations, most of which derive from its observational design. Although patients were subject to adjudication by experts, some uncertainty remains regarding the validity of the diagnosis "cancer-related SIADH". Furthermore, potentially hyponatremia-inducing drugs are highly prevalent and interfere with diagnostic precision. However, since the study's intent was to capture "real-world" practice, this limitation does not detract from observing how clinician-diagnosed SIADH in the oncology setting is managed. As in other hyponatremia trials, numerical changes of [Na +] were used as the primary measure of effectiveness; neither symptoms nor clinical outcome after therapy were reported routinely as it is extremely difficult to assign these unambiguously to hyponatremia, especially in the oncology setting.

In summary, despite the high prevalence of hyponatremia and published guidance on its diagnosis and treatment, numerous shortcomings in current management of hyponatremia in cancer-related SIADH are evident. Hyponatremia in a cancer patient is readily assumed by clinicians to be due to SIADH without sufficient attention to accepted diagnostic criteria. Moreover, many patients correctly diagnosed with SIADH do not receive any treatment for hyponatremia at all, and a considerable number of patients are discharged with unresolved hyponatremia. FR and NS are the two most frequently used therapies but are ineffective in about two thirds of cases. Of note, this lack of efficacy is more pronounced in cancer patients than in non-cancer-related SIADH. With the vaptans, a group of highly effective and yet safe compounds is available and the findings of this analysis strongly suggests that they should be viewed as first-line choice of treatment. However, they are only used in the minority of cases in current practice. We therefore conclude that there is a need to focus educational efforts on (1) how to diagnose SIADH correctly, (2) the lack of uniform efficacy of FR and NS, (3) the use of active treatments, and (4) increasing awareness of risk factors for overcorrection. Despite clear evidence that hyponatremia is associated with poor prognosis in particular in cancer patients, proof of causation is still lacking. Future research efforts should, therefore, focus on which cancer patients will benefit most from correction of hyponatremia.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to management of mildly symptomatic patients (acute setting), ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining a follow-up serum sodium concentration after 4 hours, using the same technique as used for the previous measurement.

### Managing hyponatremia in patients with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion [^115JmoqJ]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

This review will address the management of hyponatremia caused by the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) in hospitalized patients. To do so requires an understanding of the pathogenesis and diagnosis of SIADH, as well as currently available treatment options. The review will be structured as responses to a series of questions, followed by a presentation of an algorithm for determining the most appropriate treatments for individual patients with SIADH based on their presenting symptoms.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia: conventional and novel aspects [^113us68x]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a frequent electrolyte disorder. A hyponatremia is called acute severe (< 115 mM) when the duration has been < 36 to 48 h. Such patients often have advanced symptoms as a result of brain edema. Acute severe hyponatremia is a medical emergency. It should be corrected rapidly to approximately 130 mM to prevent permanent brain damage. In contrast, in chronic severe hyponatremia (> 4 to 6 d), there is no brain edema and symptoms are usually mild. In such patients, a number of authors have recommended a correction rate < 0.5 mM/h to approximately 130 mM to minimize the risk of cerebral myelinolysis. Sometimes it is not possible to diagnose whether a severe hyponatremia is acute or chronic. In such cases, an initial imaging procedure is helpful in deciding whether rapid or slow correction should be prescribed. The modalities of treatment of severe hyponatremia have so far consisted of infusions of hypertonic saline plus fluid restriction. In the near future, vasopressin antagonists will become available. Preliminary experience has already demonstrated their efficiency of inducing a sustained water diuresis and a correction of hyponatremia.

### SIADH-related hyponatremia in hospital day care units: clinical experience and management with tolvaptan [^117U8ppg]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Based on the findings from these clinical cases, all hyponatremia patients were correctly treated in the DCU, with no serious adverse effects from the medication. They all started chemotherapy in no more than 48 h. Subsequently, the treatment with tolvaptan might have led to an improvement of the ECOG-performance status. In addition, all patients benefited from the effective management of SIADH by receiving the hyponatremia treatment in the same place they received their chemotherapy and also by being able to go home instead of going through the inconveniences and risks that can arise with hospitalization. Our conclusion is that hyponatremia can be treated in hospital DCU as long as proper monitoring of the serum levels can be performed.

Despite the limitations of retrospective observational studies, the positive results of these cases support the hypothesis that tolvaptan can be used effectively and safely in hospital DCU. There is no other similar published data so our experience and recommendations can be a good reference for other professionals in the field who may want to benefit from treating their patients with tolvaptan as outpatients instead of in hospital.

Recommendations for the use of tolvaptan in hospital DCU

Based on the previous information, some minimum recommendations are proposed.

Patient selection

The most suited patients for this protocol are those with moderate hyponatremia (120–129 mmol/l) with mild/moderate symptoms, currently on anti-cancer active or palliative treatment (provided that the correction of hyponatremia is part of their established treatment strategy).
Patients at higher risk of demyelination syndromes (those with hypoxia, alcoholism, or malnutrition) should be avoided since they would need closer management. Patients must not present any contraindications for the use of tolvaptan like hypersensitivity to the active substance/excipients, anuria, volume depletion, hypovolemic hyponatremia, and hypernatremia, patients who cannot perceive thirst and pregnancy or breast feeding.
Patients must be able to stay at the hospital within 6 h for an analytical control and then return again 24 h after treatment initiation for further controls. In addition, they should live at less than 1-h distance from hospital in case of emergency as well as have good family support. This protocol can only be carried out in DCU with a minimum of 12 h continued attention so patients can have a control 6 h after treatment initiation.
Patients/their relatives will be informed about the possible side effects of the treatment with tolvaptan and asked to return to hospital immediately if the patient experiences any of them.

### Treatment of hyponatremia [^113pumUb]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We review literature from the past 18 months on the treatment of hyponatremia. Therapy must address both the consequences of the untreated electrolyte disturbance (including fatal cerebral edema due to acute water intoxication) and the complications of excessive therapy (the osmotic demyelination syndrome).

Recent Findings

Correction of hyponatremia by 4–6 mEq/l within 6 h, with bolus infusions of 3% saline if necessary, is sufficient to manage the most severe manifestations of hyponatremia. Planning therapy to achieve a 6 mEq/l daily increase in the serum sodium concentration can avoid iatrogenic brain damage by staying well clear of correction rates that are harmful. Conservative correction goals are wise because inadvertent overcorrection is common. Administration of desmopressin to halt a water diuresis can help prevent overcorrection; if overcorrection occurs, therapeutic relowering of the serum sodium concentration is supported by data in experimental animals and was found to be safe in a small observational clinical trial. Even mild and apparently asymptomatic hyponatremia may lead to falls because of impaired gait, and an increased likelihood of fracture because of hyponatremia-induced osteoporosis, a newly described entity. Recently approved vasopressin antagonists now make it possible to normalize the serum sodium concentration on a chronic basis, but practical considerations have limited their use.

### Rate of correction and all-cause mortality in patients with severe hypernatremia [^1139hX9K]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Some of the rationale supporting current expert opinion recommending controlled correction of hypernatremia rests on a perceived symmetry with correction of hyponatremia. While it is appealing to group these 2 common sodium disorders together, published data do not support this approach. The evidence supporting slow correction of hyponatremia is supported by animal studies, numerous case reports and large observational studies. In contrast, there are no convincing reports of even 1 adult harmed by rapid correction of hypernatremia. From a physiological perspective the risk of neurological complications seems to be much higher with rapid correction of hyponatremia, as the adaptations of brain cells to hypernatremia are much slower than to hyponatremia. Also, while the risk of complication associated with rapid correction is more common with chronic hyponatremia compared with acute hyponatremia, chronic hypernatremia is considerably less common than acute hypernatremia. Our results were comparable for patients with hypernatremia on admission compared with those who were diagnosed during hospitalization, also supporting the safety of rapid correction of hypernatremia even when there is no clear documentation of an acute condition.

The 30-day mortality was alarmingly high in the reported cohort. This is in line with previous studies of severe hypernatremia. The absolute difference in survival between rapidly and slowly corrected patients was very large and remained so after adjustment for potential confounders. Interestingly, the size of the absolute difference in survival was comparable at 30 days and at 1 year following documentation of severe hypernatremia. This might suggest that the different mortality rates do not represent differences in the patient populations unaccounted by the statistical analysis, but rather the results of the treatment strategies for severe hypernatremia, namely the rate of correction. An additional support to this hypothesis is the strong correlation reported between the absolute sodium correction in the first 24 hours and patient survival. This implies that the high mortality rates known to be associated with severe hypernatremia might be partly attributed to lack of aggressive rehydration, which might improve patient outcomes.

### Tolvaptan for the treatment of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^1116jHGB]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

We recommend the use of tolvaptan for treatment of SIAD, mainly in hospitalised patients, and also in selected outpatients. The four scenarios of tolvaptan use are illustrated below.

As second-line therapy, after failure of patient to respond to at least 48-h fluid restriction.
As first-line therapy in selected cases when there is a clinical need for prompt correction of hyponatraemia. Classic examples are the need to render a patient fit for surgery or its use in patients with malignant SIAD who are waiting to start chemotherapy with drugs, which either can worsen hyponatraemia by themselves, such as platinum-based agents, or require infusion of large volumes of fluids.
As first-line therapy in patients who are highly unlikely to respond to fluid restriction, for example, when urine osmolality exceeds 500 mOsm/kg or the urine/plasma electrolyte ratio is above 1.
For chronic use in outpatients. This only applies to selected complex cases who are either refractory or cannot adhere to other treatment modalities. A classic clinical scenario is that of patients with refractory malignant SIAD, most often due to lung cancer, who would otherwise require recurrent hospitalisations and experience a poor quality of life.

### Clinical factors associated with hyponatremia correction during treatment with oral urea [^1162Mnj7]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What was known:

In patients with chronic hyponatremia plasma sodium should be gradually corrected to prevent osmotic demyelination.
Recent observational studies have reported positive experiences with oral urea for the treatment of hyponatremia, but factors associated with the correction rate are unknown.

This study adds:

Older age, lower baseline plasma sodium and higher cumulative urea dose increase the correction rate of hyponatremia during treatment with oral urea.
Combining oral urea with fluid restriction may further increase the correction rate of hyponatremia.

Potential impact:

In patients with hyponatremia who are older or have a low initial plasma sodium, oral urea may need to be given for a shorter duration without fluid restriction.
Our study also adds to the growing body of evidence that oral urea generally is a safe and effective treatment for hyponatremia.

### Recent developments in the management of acute and chronic hyponatremia [^1114uqkz]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of the study is to review recent studies on the management of acute and chronic hyponatremia.

Recent Findings

In acute symptomatic hyponatremia, bolus infusion of hypertonic saline improves hyponatremia and neurological status more quickly than continuous infusion. In chronic hyponatremia, newly identified predictors of nonresponse to fluid restriction include a high urine osmolality (> 500mOsm/kg) and high urine sodium (> 133mmol/l). Vasopressin-receptor antagonists effectively raise the serum sodium concentration in patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia but have a risk of overcorrection, even at low doses. Several observational studies now support the use of urea for a more gradual correction of hyponatremia without a risk of overcorrection. Recently identified risk factors for overcorrection include lower serum sodium at presentation, polydipsia, hypovolemia, and early urine output during treatment. Specific treatments with potential efficacy are the use of intravenous albumin for hyponatremia because of liver cirrhosis, and fludrocortisone for hyponatremia in tuberculous meningitis.

Summary

The recent data will help to further optimize and personalize the management of patients with acute and chronic hyponatremia. However, most data are still observational and retrospective. Therefore, the field is in need of prospective studies comparing interventions for chronic hyponatremia and focusing on patient-relevant outcomes.

### Serum sodium correction rate and the outcome in severe hyponatremia [^1163vBiq]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We investigated the serum sodium correction rate on length of hospitalization and survival rate, in severe chronic hyponatremic patients at the Emergency Department (ED).

Design

An observational study using clinical chart review.

Setting

The ED of the University Hospital of Marcianise, Caserta, Italy with approximately 30,000 patients visits a year.

Type Of Participants

We reviewed sixty-seven patients with severe hyponatremia subdivided in 2 subgroups: group A consisting of 35 patients with serum sodium correction rate < 0.3mmol/h and group B consisting of 32 patients with serum sodium correction rate between < 0.5 and ≥ 0.3mmol/h.

Intervention

Emergency patients were evaluated for serum sodium correction rate for hyponatremia by clinical chart review.

Measurements and Main Results

Severe hyponatremia was defined as a serum sodium level < 120mmol/l. Mean serum sodium correction rate of hyponatremia was of 0.17 ± 0.09% in group A and 0.41 ± 0.05% in group B (p < 0.001 vs group A). The length of hospital stay was 10.7 ± 3.7days for group A, and it was significantly decreased to 3.8 ± 0.4days for group B (p < 0.005 vs group A). In addition we observed that correction rate of hyponatremia in group A was associated with a significantly lower survival rate (25%) in comparison to group B (60%) (p < 0.001 vs group A).

Conclusion

We observed that serum sodium correction rate ≥ 0.3 and < 0.5mmol/h was associated with a shorter length of hospital stay and a major survival rate.

### Sensitivity of international classification of diseases codes for hyponatremia among commercially insured outpatients in the United States [^112PWFAM]. BMC Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Discussion

We examined the validity of ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes for the identification of hyponatremia in an outpatient managed care population using data from the IHCIS National Managed Care Benchmark Database. Our results show that while the ICD-9-CM code for hyponatremia is highly specific in outpatient claims, its sensitivity is extremely low. Even for the most severe cases (serum sodium ≤ 125 mmol/L), we found sensitivity to be less than 30%. Similarly, the positive predictive value of an outpatient professional claim for hyponatremia was only 63% using the least strict serum sodium measurement (< 136 mmol/L). These findings are consistent with an earlier study by Movig et al, which showed low sensitivity for the coding of hyponatremia in inpatient settings, although the positive predictive value of ICD-9-CM codes in outpatient claims in our study was significantly less than the corresponding inpatient rates found in the previous study.

These low rates of coding for hyponatremia may be largely due to the ICD-9-CM diagnostic coding and reporting guidelines for outpatient services. According to these guidelines, only conditions that "require or affect patient care treatment or management" should be documented. Moreover, "related signs and symptoms" should not be coded when a more definitive diagnosis is known. Thus, at mildly decreased levels requiring no medical intervention and/or in the presence of causal underlying disease such as syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone or liver cirrhosis, it may be inappropriate to code for hyponatremia on an outpatient claim. Similarly, there may be limited space available for diagnoses on the outpatient claim form. The IHCIS database, for example, allows for a maximum of 3 diagnosis codes on each professional claim record. As shown in Table 1, hyponatremia is often seen in the presence of other significant comorbidities. Given that ICD-9-CM coding guidelines also specify that one should "list first the ICD-9-CM code for the diagnosis, condition, problem, or other reason for encounter/visit shown in the medical record to be chiefly responsible for the services provided", other conditions may have taken precedence on the claim form.

### Urea for treatment of SIAD induced hyponatremia: experience of an oncology center [^111oP978]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inappropriate antidiuresis syndrome (SIAD) induced hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disturbance found in cancer patients. Available treatment options are limited by their poor efficacy, tolerability, or cost. Urea is a promising alternative, but its use in the oncology setting remains insufficiently characterized. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of urea in the management of chronic SIAD-induced hyponatremia in patients with cancer.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective observational study of patients diagnosed with SIAD and treated with oral urea at our Oncology Center between August 2021 and June 2023. Sodium levels were recorded before urea initiation, at the first reevaluation and at the last available follow-up.

Results

The cohort included 28 patients, mostly men (71%), with a mean age of 63.9 ± 10.0 years; 86% had metastatic disease. Lung cancer was the most frequent diagnosis, mostly small cell lung carcinoma. Urea treatment resulted in a statistically significant increase in serum sodium both in inpatients (mean increase of 2.4 ± 3.5mmol/L after 12 (23) hours, p = 0.016) and outpatients (mean increase of 8.6 ± 6.6mmol/L after 8 (11) days, p = 0.003). No cases of sodium overcorrection or clinically significant adverse events were reported. One patient complained of urea taste, with no impact on treatment adherence. Sodium normalization following cancer treatment allowed for urea discontinuation in 21% of cases. Median follow-up was 84 days (range 3 days-20.9 months).

Conclusion

Our study suggests that urea may be a safe, effective, and well-tolerated option for the long-term management of SIAD-related hyponatremia in oncology patients, but further studies are necessary to confirm these observations.

### Hypertonic saline and desmopressin: a simple strategy for safe correction of severe hyponatremia [^111nqQot]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Prompt correction of severe hyponatremia is important, but correction also must be limited to avoid iatrogenic osmotic demyelination. Expert opinion recommends that serum sodium level not be increased by more than 10–12 mEq/L in any 24-hour period and/or 18 mEq/L in any 48-hour period. However, inadvertent overcorrection is common, usually caused by the unexpected emergence of a water diuresis.

Study Design

Quality improvement report.

Setting & Participants

All 25 patients admitted to a community teaching hospital between October 1, 2008, and September 30, 2011, who were treated for serum sodium level < 120 mEq/L with concurrently administered desmopressin and hypertonic saline solution.

Quality Improvement Plan

Concurrently administered desmopressin (1–2 µg parenterally every 6–8 hours) and hypertonic saline with weight-based doses adjusted to increase the serum sodium concentration by 6 mEq/L, avoiding inadvertent overcorrection of severe hyponatremia.

Outcomes

Rate of correction of hyponatremia, predictability of response to the combination, adverse events related to therapy.

Measurements

Rate of correction of hyponatremia at 4, 24, and 48 hours; administered dose of 3% saline solution, salt tablets, and potassium; predicted increase in serum sodium level.

Results

Mean changes in serum sodium levels during the first and second 24 hours of therapy were 5.8 ± 2.8 (SD) and 4.5 ± 2.2 mEq/L, respectively, without correction by > 12 mEq/L in 24 hours or > 18 mEq/L in 48 hours and without a decrease during therapy. There was no significant difference between actual and predicted increases during the first 24 hours. There was no adverse effect associated with therapy.

Limitations

Without concurrent controls, we cannot be certain that outcomes are improved. Balance studies were not performed.

Conclusions

Combined 3% saline solution and desmopressin appears to be a valid strategy for correcting severe hyponatremia, but studies comparing the regimen with other therapeutic strategies are needed.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to management of mildly symptomatic patients (acute setting), ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to ensure that the serum sodium concentration has been measured using the same technique used for the previous measurement and that no administrative errors in sample handling have occurred.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of exercise-associated hyponatremia: 2019 update [^111Qzmkn]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) — acute in-hospital treatment recommendations — Oral and IV hypotonic or isotonic hydration should be avoided early in the management of EAH, although it may be appropriate in certain clinical contexts once sodium correction has been initiated or hypovolemia is confirmed. Recommendation grade: 1C. With suspected EAH, and particularly in those with altered mental status, sodium estimation should be obtained as rapidly as possible after hospital arrival. Recommendation grade: 1A. A rapid assessment for signs and symptoms of cerebral edema or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema should be done in all patients with possible EAH. Recommendation grade: 1A. Severe EAH biochemically confirmed or symptomatic EAH should be treated with a 100-mL bolus of IV HTS, which can be repeated twice at 10-min intervals (3 doses in total) or until improvement of neurologic symptoms, with the aim of acutely increasing serum sodium concentration by about 4 to 5 mmol·L−1 and reversing cerebral edema. Recommendation grade: 1A.

In addition, among the 56 patients, 6 (11%) from the "no-overcorrection" group died during hospitalization due to infectious disease (n = 4) or cancer (n = 2). Both of these conditions may have caused hyponatremia in these patients. Among the 50 patients who were discharged alive, 12 were lost to follow-up partly because they were referred to their family doctors or because they cancelled their outpatient visits unexpectedly. Among the 38 patients who were ultimately followed-up at our institution, there were no re-hospitalizations due to hyponatremia within a median follow-up of 822 (quartile, 199–1411) days.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^112sZjn1]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

After achieving an initial modest sodium increase, sufficient to prevent acute outcomes related to raised ICP, the focus turns to prevention of further rapid sodium rise to avoid overcorrection and ODS. Indeed, often the real challenge in managing severe hypotonic hyponatremia of chronic (> 24 hours) or unknown duration is to prevent this potentially deleterious overshoot. Relowering of serum sodium with IV 5% dextrose, with or without desmopressin to reduce urine output may be required, typically in a high-dependency setting, to maintain sodium rise ideally to 5 to 8 mmol above baseline within 24 hours, with a limit of no more than 10 to 12 mmol within 24 hours (see "In Case of Overcorrection: Relowering of Plasma Sodium"). In patients with risk factors for ODS (see Table 3), one should aim for even slower corrections, 4 to 6 mmol within 24 hours and a limit of 8 mmol/L in any 24-hour period, especially as such an increment is generally sufficient to prevent adverse clinical outcomes from acute hyponatremia-associated increase in ICP (see "Acute Severe Hyponatremia").

### Clinical factors associated with hyponatremia correction during treatment with oral urea [^115vMp42]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

The efficacy of oral urea was reported as early as the 1980s, but its use remained rather limited. In recent years oral urea was "rediscovered", with several observational studies reporting positive experiences for the treatment of hyponatremia. A recent systematic review confirmed that oral urea is an effective, safe and inexpensive treatment option for SIAD despite the lack of data from randomized controlled trials.

With the use of oral urea for SIAD becoming more widespread, it is also becoming increasingly important to better understand which clinical factors determine the hyponatremia correction rate during treatment. For example, several studies have shown that a lower baseline plasma sodium concentration predicts more rapid correction of hyponatremia, but it is not known whether this also pertains to treatment with oral urea. Previous studies also identified specific parameters that were associated with the response to therapy, including urine osmolality for fluid restriction and body weight for hypertonic saline. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate which clinical factors are associated with hyponatremia correction. To address this, we analyzed the hyponatremia correction rate during oral urea treatment in 140 patients from two university medical centers.

### Revisiting new data on the mortality benefit of rapid correction of hyponatremia: Déj à Vu all over again [^113Nbhcf]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Studies in the 1980s linking rapid correction of severe, chronic hyponatremia to the osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) led to a major controversy that eventually gave way to consensus guidelines. Efforts to limit correction to ≤ 8 mmol/L per day in patients at high risk of developing ODS became common practice. Recent studies have questioned these guidelines, suggesting that ODS is rare and that slow correction may increase mortality. In this review, we revisit the history of the controversy and find that these claims have persisted for four decades. Older studies supporting faster correction are flawed by referral bias while newer studies are limited by confounding as comorbidities influence rates of both mortality and hyponatremia correction. While both old and new studies emphasize the rarity of MRI-documented ODS after rapid correction, they were not conducted in hyponatremic patients who were at risk for ODS. Old studies reporting hyponatremic deaths due to cerebral edema overestimate its true incidence and new studies reporting an association of mortality and slow rates of sodium correction do not document cerebral edema as a common contributor to death. Further research is required to better define the incidence of both ODS and cerebral edema in patients at risk for these complications. Until then, we conclude that the risks of rapid correction-including irreversible neurological damage-necessitate caution. Clinicians should continue to prioritize slow, controlled sodium correction to protect high-risk patients from harm.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^115ACxpd]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Guidelines received the highest scores for scope and purpose (median 62%; range 28% to 92%) and clarity of presentation (median 47%; range 27% to 75%), and lowest scores for applicability (median 19%; range 10% to 68%) and editorial independence (median 19%; range 2% to 79%).

Initial appraisal results differed more than one point on the Likert scale between two or more reviewers for 143/230 items (62%). The majority of discrepancies were found in the domain 'Clarity of Presentation', with 90% of items differing more than one point. Group discussion resulted in 287/920 (31%) of individual entries being changed. Finally, no scores differed more than two points and for 82% of items, scores were the same or within one point of each other. Major reasons for changing an entry were a change of own opinion after clarification of the opinion of other reviewers during the group discussion (180/920 entries; 20% entries); aiming for consistency between entries given same available data (39/920; 4%); re-evaluation of the score in light of a noted comment during the appraisal process (30/920; 3%); correction for available data that were overlooked during the initial appraisal (22/920; 2%); misinterpretation of the question during the initial appraisal (6/920; 0.7%); adjusting for arbitrary scoring of items that were felt to be inapplicable for some reason (3/920; 0.3%); adjusting for inconsistent approach to deal with the assumption that a criterion was fulfilled even if this was not clearly mentioned (4/920; 0.4%); and data entry error (3/920, 0.3%). Overall, this resulted in 29/60 (48%) of standardized domain scores being downgraded by a maximum of 10% and 10/60 (17%) of standardized domain scores being upgraded with a maximum of 10%; the remaining 35% remained unchanged.

### Clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia [^115ov627]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to management of moderately symptomatic patients, ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to consider targeting a 5 mmol/L increase in serum sodium concentration per 24-hour period.

### Clinical practice guidelines treatment of acute hyperkalaemia in adults [^113YXfBL]. UKKA (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hyperkalemia, more specifically with respect to indications for outpatient treatment, UKKA 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate interventions to lower serum potassium in patients with serum potassium ≥ 5.5 mmol/L.

### Hyponatremia: clinical diagnosis and management [^114nfxLE]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common clinical problem in hospitalized patients and nursing home residents. It also may occur in healthy athletes after endurance exercise. The majority of patients with hyponatremia are asymptomatic and do not require immediate correction of hyponatremia. Symptomatic hyponatremia is a medical emergency requiring rapid correction to prevent the worsening of brain edema. How fast we should increase the serum sodium levels depends on the onset of hyponatremia and still remains controversial. If the serum sodium levels are corrected too rapidly, patients may develop central pontine myelinolysis, but if they are corrected too slowly, patients may die of brain herniation. We review the epidemiology and mechanisms of hyponatremia, the sensitivity of women to hyponatremic injury, the adaptation and maladaptation of brain cells to hyponatremia and its correction, and the practical ways of managing hyponatremia. Because the majority of hyponatremia is caused by the non-osmotic release of vasopressin, the recent approval of the vasopressin receptor antagonist conivaptan for euvolemic hyponatremia may simplify hyponatremia management. However, physicians should be aware of the risk of rapid correction of hyponatremia, hypotension, and excessive fluid intake.

### Use of urea for the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone: a systematic review [^116Pp77B]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

In case of severe acute hyponatremia, 3% sodium chloride infusions will most likely remain standard of care because they have an even more rapid onset of effect and are easy to titrate. However, in the outpatient setting, in hospitalized patients with less severe and less acute hyponatremia, and in patients with triggers that are not easy to control such as psychotropic medications, urea could be a safe and effective treatment option at low costs. Importantly, a dose-effect relationship of urea on free water excretion may be present which is dependent on urinary osmolality. Randomized clinical trials against the criterion standard of 3% sodium chloride infusions in acute hyponatremia from SIADH or VRA in chronic SIADH would be needed to further evaluate to potential role of urea in the treatment of hyponatremia in SIADH.

Limitations

There were several limitations to this systematic review. First, evidence from randomized clinical trials does not exist and few studies even have control groups. In addition to confounding by indication for urea therapy, it is very likely that publication bias was also present since we only identified trials with positive treatment effects. Also, there was inconsistent handling of fluid restriction. Finally, treatment of the trigger situation (eg, infection, pain, brain trauma) itself can improve serum sodium concentration in SIADH patients and in uncontrolled trials this effect cannot be separated.
