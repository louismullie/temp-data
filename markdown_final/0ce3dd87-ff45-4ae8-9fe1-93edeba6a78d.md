## Question

male UTI allergies to sulfa what should i use

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what antibiotics to use for a male UTI in the setting of a sulfonamide (sulfa) allergy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about correctly classifying the syndrome in men as cystitis, pyelonephritis, or prostatitis. Then, I should verify the sulfa allergy details and cross-reactivity concerns. Next, I will consider renal function, prior antibiotic exposures, and local resistance. After that, I should align oral and IV options with guideline recommendations, including tissue penetration needs and durations. Finally, I need to plan cultures, reassessment at 48–72 hours, and explicit safety warnings with a brief decision algorithm, while self-checking any potential missteps along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical classification, because management hinges on syndrome identification in males who are generally considered to have complicated infections unless a true lower-tract cystitis without systemic features is confidently established. I need to check for fever, flank pain, rigors, obstructive symptoms, catheter status, and any signs that point toward prostatitis such as perineal pain, obstructive voiding, or tender prostate on exam, since that would alter antibiotic selection and duration due to penetration requirements. I should also ensure a urine culture is obtained before antibiotics in all men to guide therapy and de-escalation, given less predictable microbiology and higher resistance variability in male UTIs [^116MgLK6].

> Now, I need to verify the sulfa allergy details and what that means pharmacologically. If the patient has a documented sulfonamide antibiotic allergy, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) is contraindicated, so I must avoid all antimicrobial sulfonamides; I should confirm the reaction type and timing because many patients carry nonspecific labels. Hold on, I should verify cross-reactivity with nonantibiotic sulfonamides since patients and clinicians often over-avoid those; population data suggest minimal and nonspecific cross-reactivity, which argues against broadly avoiding thiazides or loop diuretics solely due to a sulfonamide antibiotic allergy. If the past reaction was a benign cutaneous eruption more than five years ago and delabeling would materially improve care, a supervised single-dose oral challenge per AAAAI practice parameters can be considered in appropriate settings, but that is separate from acute UTI management today [^1167FBMS] [^11322EiU].

> Next, I should review renal function and pharmacokinetics because they directly affect drug selection and dosing. Nitrofurantoin requires adequate renal excretion to achieve therapeutic urinary concentrations and should not be used if creatinine clearance is significantly reduced; furthermore, it is not suitable for tissue infections like pyelonephritis due to poor parenchymal penetration. Wait, I need to verify my own prior thought that I could "reduce the nitrofurantoin dose" if eGFR were 30–60 mL/min; on second thought, that is not guideline-concordant — practice standards emphasize avoiding nitrofurantoin when renal function is below about 30 mL/min rather than dose-reducing, and to select an alternative agent instead. I should also anticipate dosing adjustments with aminoglycosides and many beta-lactams when renal function is impaired [^notfound].

> For suspected lower-tract cystitis without systemic illness and no concern for prostate involvement, I should consider agents with reliable urine activity while acknowledging that true "uncomplicated" cystitis is uncommon in men. Let me think about options: nitrofurantoin for 5–7 days is reasonable if renal function is adequate, although its lack of prostatic penetration requires me to be confident prostatitis is not present; fosfomycin can be used, but men often need repeated dosing every 48–72 hours rather than a single dose; trimethoprim monotherapy can be considered if local resistance allows and prostate involvement is not suspected. Hold on, I should verify that these choices align with guidelines; while most first-line statements are written for women, the same agents are often extrapolated to men with caution, emphasizing culture-directed therapy given the variability in male microbiology and penetration needs [^116hPLMo].

> If the presentation is consistent with complicated UTI or pyelonephritis but the patient is stable for outpatient oral therapy, I should confirm local resistance and prior antibiotic exposure before using a fluoroquinolone, because empiric ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin should generally be avoided if local resistance exceeds about 10% or if the patient used a fluoroquinolone recently. An oral beta-lactam such as amoxicillin-clavulanate may be reasonable depending on susceptibility patterns, recognizing variable efficacy against Enterobacterales; step-down to oral therapy should follow initial parenteral therapy if the patient is more ill. I should confirm that these points are consistent with EAU and IDSA guidance emphasizing resistance thresholds, avoidance of empiric fluoroquinolones in certain settings, and narrowing once cultures return [^1127QRf6] [^116RiYrc].

> For patients with systemic illness, sepsis, or inability to take oral therapy, I will now examine inpatient parenteral options. Intravenous third-generation cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone are appropriate empiric choices, with consideration of piperacillin-tazobactam for severe infection or suspected Pseudomonas, and ertapenem when ESBL-producing organisms are likely. But wait, I should ensure to cover aminoglycoside-based combination options for more severe presentations or in areas with high resistance, with subsequent de-escalation based on cultures. Transition to oral agents should occur once clinically improved and susceptibilities permit [^117CU9Hp].

> If prostatitis is suspected, I need to ensure agent selection with excellent prostatic penetration. Fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim alone are appropriate choices when susceptibilities permit, whereas nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin have poor prostatic tissue penetration and should be avoided in that context. Duration should be longer, commonly at least 2–4 weeks, tailored to clinical response and culture results. Hold on, I should verify consistency with trial data on durations in men: although the JAMA trial addressed afebrile male UTI and not prostatitis, it supports that men with lower-tract infections often do not need prolonged therapy beyond 7 days, whereas prostatitis remains an exception due to tissue penetration and relapse risk [^1171F9GK].

> I should double-check local resistance and recent antibiotic exposures to refine empiric choices. Fluoroquinolone avoidance as first-line is emphasized by EAU in certain settings such as urology wards or when there has been recent fluoroquinolone use, and empiric ciprofloxacin is reserved for specific scenarios with low local resistance and beta-lactam anaphylaxis. Moreover, outpatient resistance data often reveal higher resistance to TMP/SMX and ampicillin, with relatively lower resistance to nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin, which should inform empiric selection pending culture, although men should not be managed solely by female-focused algorithms [^notfound] [^1127QRf6] [^116DV2Di].

> Regarding durations, let me reconsider the minimal effective course. In afebrile men with lower-tract UTI treated with ciprofloxacin or TMP/SMX, 7 days was noninferior to 14 days for symptom resolution, which supports shorter courses when clinically appropriate; for catheter-associated UTI with prompt response, IDSA also supports a 7-day course, and in select non-severely ill CA-UTI, a 5-day levofloxacin course may be considered. I should confirm that longer durations remain indicated for prostatitis or delayed clinical response, with reassessment guiding total therapy length [^1171F9GK] [^116RiYrc] [^111SqEwW].

> Before treatment, I need to ensure that a urine culture is obtained, then reassess the patient at 48–72 hours to confirm clinical response and to tailor antibiotics to susceptibilities. Let me verify key pitfalls: nitrofurantoin should not be used for suspected pyelonephritis due to poor tissue penetration, and lack of improvement should trigger evaluation for obstruction, abscess, or alternative diagnoses. I should also confirm that symptoms and culture results align, avoiding treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria outside of specific indications, while ensuring source control such as catheter management when relevant [^114umbrL] [^116MgLK6].

> Critical safety checks are essential here. I should confirm again that TMP/SMX and other antimicrobial sulfonamides are contraindicated in true sulfonamide antibiotic allergy, so these are off the table. I also need to remember growing stewardship restrictions and adverse event concerns around fluoroquinolones, using them only when clearly indicated by susceptibility and resistance context. Finally, I should keep in mind that nitrofurantoin requires adequate renal function and is inappropriate for upper-tract or prostatic infections. Wait, let me verify relative adverse events of common regimens; large observational data suggest more adverse drug events with TMP/SMX relative to nitrofurantoin, which further supports avoiding TMP/SMX in this patient beyond the allergy issue [^1167FBMS] [^114umbrL] [^1142QscD].

> Let me now outline a concise decision path while keeping my self-checks explicit. If the clinical picture is consistent with lower-tract cystitis without systemic illness and no prostate involvement, start nitrofurantoin for 5–7 days if renal function allows or use multi-dose fosfomycin, with immediate culture and a plan to adjust per susceptibilities; if renal function is impaired or there is any concern for prostate involvement, choose an alternative such as amoxicillin-clavulanate or, if conditions allow, a fluoroquinolone per resistance thresholds and prior exposure, again tailoring to culture. If complicated UTI or pyelonephritis is suspected, select an oral or IV regimen per stability, resistance, and ESBL risk, such as ceftriaxone or piperacillin-tazobactam parenterally with step-down, aiming for about 7 days if response is prompt. If prostatitis is suspected, use a fluoroquinolone or trimethoprim alone for at least 2–4 weeks, avoiding nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin due to poor tissue penetration, and reassess at 48–72 hours with adjustments per culture [^1127QRf6] [^117CU9Hp] [^116RiYrc].

> I should acknowledge and correct my earlier missteps explicitly. Earlier I almost suggested dose-reducing nitrofurantoin for eGFR 30–60 mL/min and even briefly considered daptomycin in severe renal impairment; but wait, that does not hold up. Nitrofurantoin should be avoided, not dose-reduced, with significant renal dysfunction, and daptomycin is not an appropriate agent for typical gram-negative uropathogens causing UTI, nor is it used for this indication. Additionally, I initially applied a "less than 20% resistance" threshold to trimethoprim as if it were TMP/SMX; hold on, I should verify that threshold originates from TMP/SMX data in uncomplicated female cystitis and, in men, empiric use of trimethoprim should be guided by local data and, preferably, culture-directed therapy given the higher variability of pathogens and involvement of the prostate [^114umbrL].

> Finally, I need to ensure follow-up logistics are in place. I should arrange timely review of culture and susceptibility results with a plan to de-escalate or switch agents accordingly, confirm clinical improvement within 48–72 hours, and evaluate for complications if symptoms persist. I should counsel on adverse effects and when to seek urgent care, and emphasize antimicrobial stewardship principles, including avoiding unnecessary fluoroquinolones and never re-exposing to sulfonamide antibiotics in a confirmed sulfa allergy unless formally delabeled via an evidence-based challenge pathway in a controlled setting [^114umbrL] [^11322EiU].

In men with UTI and a sulfa allergy, **avoid TMP-SMX** and use **nitrofurantoin 100 mg PO BID for 7 days** if CrCl ≥ 30 mL/min and there is no suspicion for prostatitis or pyelonephritis. If nitrofurantoin is unsuitable, **fosfomycin 3 g PO every 48 hours for 3 doses** is an option for lower UTI only. For suspected prostatitis or pyelonephritis, use a **fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) for 7–14 days** if local resistance is < 10% and there has been no recent fluoroquinolone use [^1127QRf6] [^114umbrL]. Otherwise, use a **third-generation cephalosporin (cefixime, cefpodoxime, or ceftriaxone)** for 7–14 days. Always obtain a urine culture and tailor therapy to susceptibilities [^116MgLK6].

---

## Recommended antibiotic alternatives

### Nitrofurantoin

- **Indication**: Uncomplicated lower UTIs (cystitis) in men without suspected prostatitis or pyelonephritis.
- **Dosage**: 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days.
- **Renal function**: Contraindicated if creatinine clearance (CrCl) < 30 mL/min.
- **Limitations**: Ineffective for prostatitis or pyelonephritis due to poor tissue penetration.

---

### Fosfomycin trometamol

Fosfomycin trometamol is indicated only for **uncomplicated lower UTIs (cystitis)** and is not suitable for prostatitis or pyelonephritis due to inadequate tissue penetration. The recommended regimen is **3 g orally every 48 hours for three doses**.

---

### Fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin)

- **Indication**: Complicated UTIs, prostatitis, or pyelonephritis [^1127QRf6].
- **Dosage**: Ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily or levofloxacin 750 mg orally once daily for 7–14 days [^1171F9GK].
- **Considerations**: Use only if local resistance rates are < 10% and no recent fluoroquinolone use; avoid in patients with fluoroquinolone allergies or significant adverse reactions [^114umbrL].

---

### Beta-lactam antibiotics (cephalosporins)

Beta-lactam antibiotics (cephalosporins) are **alternatives for complicated UTIs, prostatitis, or pyelonephritis** [^117CU9Hp]. Options include cefixime 400 mg orally once daily, cefpodoxime 200 mg orally twice daily, or ceftriaxone 1–2 g IV daily for 7–14 days. They are generally safe in sulfa-allergic patients, though allergic reactions should still be monitored [^113i3tBH].

---

## Antibiotics to avoid in sulfa-allergic patients

In sulfa-allergic patients, **trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)** is contraindicated due to the risk of severe hypersensitivity reactions [^1167FBMS]. **Other sulfonamide antibiotics** should also be avoided because of potential cross-reactivity.

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

- **Obtain urine culture**: Always obtain a urine culture and sensitivity test before initiating antibiotic therapy to guide targeted treatment.
- **Monitor renal function**: Regularly monitor renal function, especially when using nitrofurantoin or fosfomycin.
- **Allergy documentation**: Clearly document the patient's sulfa allergy and communicate it to all healthcare providers [^11322EiU].
- **Patient education**: Educate patients about potential allergic reactions and instruct them to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms occur [^1142QscD].

### Urinary tract infection in male patients: Challenges in management [^112TE65A]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections in male patients share many of the management principles used in the management of female patients. These include the need to accurately define the clinical syndrome, choose empirical therapy based on the severity of illness and the potential for antimicrobial resistance, and consider the need for source control in severely ill patients. The microbiology of the causative organisms is more unpredictable compared to female patients, and data to inform treatment decisions from clinical trials specific to male patients are relatively scarce.

### Association of adverse events with antibiotic treatment for urinary tract infection [^1142QscD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Little is known about the relative harms of different antibiotic regimens prescribed to treat uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI). We sought to compare the risk of adverse events associated with commonly used oral antibiotic regimens for the outpatient treatment of uncomplicated UTI.

- **Methods**: Using data from the IBM® MarketScan® Commercial Database, we identified 1,169,033 otherwise healthy, nonpregnant women aged 18–44 years with uncomplicated UTI who initiated an oral antibiotic with activity against common uropathogens from 1 July 2006 to 30 September 2015. We used propensity score-weighted Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate the association between antibiotic agent and adverse events.

- **Results**: Of two first-line agents, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (vs. nitrofurantoin) was associated with a higher risk of several adverse drug events including hypersensitivity reaction (hazard ratio, 2.62; 95% confidence interval, 2.30–2.98), acute renal failure (2.56; 1.55–4.25), skin rash (2.42; 2.13–2.75), urticaria (1.37; 1.19–1.57), abdominal pain (1.14; 1.09–1.19), and nausea/vomiting (1.18; 1.10–1.28), but a similar risk of potential microbiome-related adverse events. Compared with nitrofurantoin, non-first-line agents were associated with a higher risk of several adverse drug events and potential microbiome-related adverse events including non-Clostridium difficile diarrhea, C. difficile infection, vaginitis/vulvovaginal candidiasis, and pneumonia. Treatment duration modified the risk of potential microbiome-related adverse events.

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: Randomised controlled trial [^115qQwRP]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are one of the most common conditions seen in female patients in general practice. These infections affect 50% of women at least once in their lives, and more than 20% of infections are resistant to trimethoprim and cephalosporins, and 50% to amoxicillin.

Urinary dipsticks are the most commonly used near-patient test in primary care in the United Kingdom. The aim of using dipsticks is to target treatment to the 60% of women who have urinary tract infections, while minimizing antibiotic use for women without infection. A previous validation study has shown that dipsticks and clinical scoring algorithms can potentially help improve the precision of diagnosis by improving the positive predictive values. If clinicians are to use dipsticks, however, they need to have strategies to deal with the poor negative predictive values. We know of no trial that has assessed dipstick or clinical management algorithms in comparison with the realistic alternatives. Previous studies have documented that delayed antibiotic prescribing in respiratory infections results in good symptom control, reduced belief in the effectiveness of antibiotics, and fewer repeat consultations. We hypothesized that, compared with an immediate antibiotic prescription, other management strategies would result in worse symptom control, particularly in women asked to delay antibiotics empirically or while waiting for the result of midstream urine analysis.

### Alternative to prophylactic antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: Multicentre, open label, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^112SsJ43]. BMJ (2022). High credibility.

Procedures were organized for participants assigned to antibiotic prophylaxis. The drug choice was determined by previous urine culture results and individuals' history of allergy or intolerance. Options included nitrofurantoin (50 or 100 mg), trimethoprim (100 mg), or cefalexin (250 mg), administered orally once daily. Methenamine hippurate was prescribed as a twice-daily oral dose (1 g). While participants could switch between antibiotic drugs or treatment strategies, adherence to the allocated intervention was emphasized. Participants experiencing symptomatic UTI episodes were advised to seek treatment courses of antibiotics through their general practitioner.

Follow-up assessments took place every three months up to 18 months. During each visit, participants reported any UTIs, treatment adherence, and adverse events. Healthcare records confirmed UTI episodes, as needed. Blood samples monitored kidney and liver function in all participants. Urine samples were submitted to the central laboratory at baseline, during three-monthly visits, and at UTI episodes. Optional perineal swabs were submitted at baseline and during six-monthly visits. Participants completed symptom questionnaires every three months and concurrently with symptomatic UTI episodes.

The evidence regarding an association between the nitrofuran and sulfonamide classes of antibiotics and birth defects is mixed. As with all patients, antibiotics should be prescribed for pregnant women only for appropriate indications and for the shortest effective duration. During the second and third trimesters, sulfonamides and nitrofurantoins may continue to be used as first-line agents for the treatment and prevention of urinary tract infections and other infections caused by susceptible organisms. Prescribing sulfonamides or nitrofurantoin in the first trimester is still considered appropriate when no other suitable alternative antibiotics are available. Pregnant women should not be denied appropriate treatment for infections because untreated infections can commonly lead to serious maternal and fetal complications.

### Sulfatrim [^112uUetQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Prescribing sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension should be given with caution to patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, those with possible folate deficiency (e.g. the elderly, chronic alcoholics, patients receiving anticonvulsant therapy, patients with malabsorption syndrome, and patients in malnutrition states), and those with severe allergies or bronchial asthma. In glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient individuals, hemolysis may occur. This reaction is frequently dose-related (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).
- **Use in the elderly**: Cases of hypoglycemia in non-diabetic patients treated with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are rarely seen, usually occurring following a few days of therapy. Patients with renal dysfunction, liver disease, malnutrition, or those receiving high doses of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are particularly at risk.

	- Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly patients or in patients with preexisting folic acid deficiency or kidney failure. These effects are reversible by folinic acid therapy.

	- Trimethoprim has been noted to impair phenylalanine metabolism, but this is of no significance in phenylketonuric patients on appropriate dietary restriction.

As with all drugs containing sulfonamides, caution is advised.

### Treatments for symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy [^115GwfrB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis, are serious complications that can result in significant maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. There are numerous drugs and combinations available to treat urinary tract infections, most of which have been tested in non-pregnant women. Attempts to define the optimal antibiotic regimen for pregnancy have, therefore, been problematic.
- **Objectives**: The objective of this review was to determine, based on the best available evidence from randomized controlled trials, which agent is most effective for the treatment of symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy. This was assessed in terms of cure rates, reinfection, incidence of preterm delivery and premature rupture of membranes, admission to neonatal intensive care units, the need for a change of antibiotic, and the incidence of prolonged pyrexia.
- **Search strategy**: The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (January 2003) and reference lists of articles were searched.
- **Selection criteria**: All trials where the intention was to randomly allocate participants to one of at least two alternative treatments for any symptomatic urinary tract infection were considered.
- **Data collection and analysis**: Both reviewers assessed trial quality and extracted data.
- **Main results**: Eight studies were included, recruiting a total of 905 pregnant women. In most comparisons, there were no significant differences between studied treatments regarding cure rates, reinfection, incidence of preterm delivery and premature rupture of membranes, and admissions to neonatal intensive care units.

### Aplastic anaemia following antibiotic use for urinary tract infection [^1149TARh]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Aplastic anaemia is often associated with recent viral illnesses, including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and parvovirus, along with certain medications such as anticonvulsants and sulfa-containing antibiotics. We describe a case report of a female patient in her 70s who presented with pancytopenia after being treated with nitrofurantoin and ciprofloxacin for a suspected urinary tract infection. She underwent an extensive workup to rule out alternative aetiologies of her pancytopenia, including a broad viral, autoimmune, and malignancy evaluation, which were unrevealing. Given her recent exposure to ciprofloxacin and nitrofurantoin, and marrow recovery following the removal of these agents, it was presumed that antibiotic exposure was the underlying cause of her aplastic anaemia.

### Lower urinary tract infections: Management, outcomes and risk factors for antibiotic re-prescription in primary care [^116MgLK6]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Low credibility.

A urine sample for microbiological investigation is recommended in all children under 3 months, all children under 16, pregnant women, and all men. An annual average increase in urine sampling for culture of 3% has been reported. We found that microbiological investigation is not being carried out as recommended. However, even if microbiological examination and/or culture were coded for one in four of all episodes of UTI in patients older than 3 months, we cannot exclude lack of recording of this information by some GPs.

As in previous studies, we investigated antibiotic re-prescription as a measure of treatment effectiveness. Because this approach has limitations, we used different definitions of re-prescription: the earliest subsequent prescription of a UTI-specific antibiotic issued within 4–28 days after the initial antibiotic prescription in the primary analysis, and within 6–28 and 8–28 days in sensitivity analyses. However, because of lack of linkage to hospital and emergency services, we did not consider progression of UTI to pyelonephritis and sepsis in the definition of re-prescription and might have missed some events. The percentage of patients re-prescribed antibiotics after an index prescription for the same UTI episode was low (3–4%), but this still represents over 3000 patients each year. We also found evidence of a statistically significant, gradual increase in antibiotic re-prescription over the five years covered by the study. Previous studies have reported rates ranging between 2% when failure requiring hospitalization was studied in a population base.

### Fosfomycin: Use beyond urinary tract and gastrointestinal infections [^113nXmyK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

The shortage of new antimicrobial agents has prompted the scientific community to reconsider the value of older antibiotics. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to gather evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of fosfomycin for treating gram-positive and/or gram-negative bacterial infections, excluding urinary tract and gastrointestinal infections. Of the 1311 studies identified as potentially relevant, 62 were reviewed in detail. Among 1604 patients with various infections — such as pneumonia, osteomyelitis, meningitis, ENT infections, surgical infections, obstetric and gynecological infections, arthritis, septicemia, peritonitis, cervical lymphadenitis, eye infections, diabetic foot infections, and typhoid fever — treated with fosfomycin alone or in combination with other antibiotics, cure was achieved in 1302 (81.1%) of the patients, while improvement was noted in 47 (2.9%).

In comparative perioperative prophylaxis trials involving 1212 patients, primarily those undergoing colorectal surgery, the fosfomycin-metronidazole combination showed similar efficacy to combinations of other antibiotics (doxycycline, ampicillin, or cephalothin) with metronidazole. In an era marked by a shortage of new antibiotics, fosfomycin may be considered an alternative treatment for infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, in addition to its traditional indications.

### Resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [^115nBctr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Sulfonamides have a glorious history. In 1935, they were the first class of true antimicrobial agents with life-saving potency. Today, 66 years later, increased bacterial resistance to sulfonamides and to trimethoprim (TMP), a synthetic antimicrobial agent that is 30 years younger than sulfonamides, has limited their use to only a few indications. In the treatment and prophylaxis of patients with urinary tract infections, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) or TMP alone is still considered the first-line drug of choice, although increased bacterial resistance to these agents has been linked with treatment failure. TMP-SMZ has a possible role as a second- or third-line treatment for patients who have respiratory tract infections.

In the developing world, where this inexpensive drug is widely used as first-line treatment, bacterial resistance has caused problems, especially with regard to the treatment of patients with severe respiratory tract infections. The use of TMP-SMZ as prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii infection has rapidly increased the multidrug resistance of bacterial pathogens found in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. Today, detailed and reliable knowledge on the resistance of bacterial pathogens to both TMP-SMZ and TMP is an essential requirement for the safe and effective use of these drugs in all clinical settings.

### Increasing antimicrobial resistance and the management of uncomplicated community-acquired urinary tract infections [^1161NYG2]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in women. Therapy for these infections is usually initiated before microbiological test results are available. Furthermore, in women with acute uncomplicated cystitis, empirical therapy without a pretherapy urine culture is often utilized. This approach is based on the highly predictable spectrum of etiologic agents causing UTIs and their antimicrobial resistance patterns.

However, antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens causing community-acquired UTIs, including both cystitis and pyelonephritis, is on the rise. Most notably, there has been an increasing resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), the drug of choice for treating acute uncomplicated cystitis in women. What implications do these trends have for the treatment of community-acquired UTIs? Preliminary data suggest that clinical cure rates may be lower among women with uncomplicated cystitis treated with TMP-SMX when the infecting pathogen is resistant to the drug. Women with pyelonephritis also exhibit less bacterial eradication and lower clinical cure rates when treated with TMP-SMX for an infection resistant to the drug.

Therefore, in the outpatient setting, identifying risk factors for TMP-SMX resistance and knowing the prevalence of TMP-SMX resistance in the local community are crucial steps in choosing an appropriate therapeutic agent. When selecting a treatment regimen, physicians should consider factors such as in vitro susceptibility, adverse effects, cost-effectiveness, and the selection of appropriate antibiotics.

### Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline [^114EP4of]. The Journal of Urology (2019). High credibility.

In addressing medical management for recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) in women, especially concerning the choice of antibiotics, the AUA/CUA/SUFU 2019 guidelines recommend considering the administration of culture-directed parenteral antibiotic therapy. The duration should be as short as reasonable, generally no longer than 7 days, particularly in patients with rUTIs experiencing acute cystitis episodes where urine cultures are resistant to oral antibiotics.

### Management of urinary tract infections: Historical perspective and current strategies: Part 2 — modern management [^113KKVik]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

An understanding of the microbial origin of infectious diseases and the introduction of antimicrobial therapy stimulated more advances in the management of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in the 20th century than had occurred in the previous five centuries.

Numerous resources were used to collect the information described in this review. Medical texts from the 19th and 20th centuries contain information regarding the traditional contemporary treatment of UTIs during those eras. Early volumes of The Journal of Urology from the beginning of the 20th century describe the first attempts at chemotherapy for UTIs. MEDLINE searches were used to collect appropriate information after 1969, and modern medical journals and texts were used to collect information on antimicrobial therapy from the late 1960s through today.

Numerous advances in the diagnosis and management of UTIs were made during the 20th century. Advances in microbiological and chemical assays have facilitated the development of historical uroscopy into modern-day urinalysis and culture techniques, which are the cornerstone of UTI diagnosis. Imaging technologies, including x-ray, ultrasound, nuclear imaging, magnetic resonance, and computerized tomography, have been particularly helpful in the diagnosis of complicated or recurrent UTIs. Major innovations in nonpharmacological therapy include noninvasive shock wave lithotripsy and percutaneous drainage of kidney abscesses. The most profound advance in UTI management during the 20th century was the discovery of antimicrobial therapy.

### Resistance trends in urinary tract pathogens and impact on management [^114L2rYR]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among urinary tract pathogens is reviewed and its clinical impact on management is determined.
- **Materials and methods**: A Medline search supplemented with references quoted in bibliographies of articles on urinary tract infections, epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens, and clinical outcomes in urinary tract infections was conducted.
- **Results**: Although some geographic variation is noted in resistance rates among urinary tract Escherichia coli isolates, rates were highest for ampicillin (39% to 45%) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (14% to 31.4%), and lowest for nitrofurantoin (1.8% to 16%) and fluoroquinolones (0.7% to 10%). Resistance rates also varied based on patient age. A few studies suggested that antimicrobial resistance impacts clinical and bacteriological outcomes, but the results are limited by the small number of patients. A randomized trial in women with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis indicated that those treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole had a clinical and bacteriological success rate significantly lower when the infecting organism was resistant compared to when it was susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
- **Conclusions**: Resistance rates among common uropathogens continue to evolve and appear to be increasing for many commonly used agents. Continued surveillance of resistance rates among uropathogens is needed to ensure that appropriate recommendations can be made for the treatment of infected patients.

### Efficacy and safety of quinolones vs. other antimicrobials for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114kn4bf]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). High credibility.

In the present study, we aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of quinolones with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, and β-lactams for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) in adults.

- **Methods**: All controlled clinical trials assessing quinolones for uncomplicated UTIs in adults were searched from PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. Meta-analyses were used to evaluate the efficacy and safety in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

- **Results**: A total of 47 RCTs consisting of 8992 patients were included in the present analysis. The clinical and bacteriological remission rates of quinolones were significantly higher (P < 0.01) compared with β-lactams and nitrofurantoin, while quinolones showed similar remission rates compared with TMP/SMX and fosfomycin. Moreover, the bacterial resistance and relapse rates of quinolones were significantly lower (P < 0.01) compared with TMP/SMX, β-lactams, and nitrofurantoin. Regarding adverse drug reactions (ADRs), quinolones did not bring higher risks. In fact, the incidence of ADRs in the quinolone group was significantly lower (P < 0.01) compared with the TMP/SMX and nitrofurantoin groups, including most reported ADRs associated with the gastrointestinal tract.

- **Conclusions**: Compared with other anti-UTI drugs, quinolones exerted an excellent effect on clinical remission and bacteriological eradication, and the application of quinolones did not bring a higher risk of ADRs.

Regarding the medical management of catheter-associated urinary tract infections, with specific attention to antibiotic therapy, the EAU 2025 guidelines recommend administering ciprofloxacin only if local resistance is less than 10% and the following conditions are met:

- **The entire treatment is given PO**: Patients should be able to tolerate oral administration.
- **Patient does not require hospitalization**: The infection can be managed in an outpatient setting.
- **Patient has anaphylaxis to β-lactam antibiotics**: Ciprofloxacin is a suitable alternative in such cases.

### Empiric use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) in the treatment of women with uncomplicated urinary tract infections, in a geographical area with a high prevalence of TMP-SMX-resistant uropathogens [^114UnsWW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

This study evaluated whether trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is effective for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) due to TMP-SMX-resistant (TMP-SMX-R) pathogens. Healthy nonpregnant premenopausal women with symptomatic lower UTI were assessed for the presence of pyuria and bacteriuria; if either was present, a urine sample was cultured, and TMP-SMX was prescribed. Clinical and microbiologic cure was assessed at days 5–9 and 28–42 after cessation of therapy. For 71% of patients, cultures grew TMP-SMX-susceptible (TMP-SMX-S) microorganisms, and for 29%, cultures grew TMP-SMX-R organisms. Escherichia coli remained the predominant bacteria in both groups of cultures. At visit 2, microbiological cure had been achieved in 86% of the patients in the TMP-SMX-S group and 42% of those in the TMP-SMX-R group. Similar differences were found at visit 3 by clinical evaluation. Treatment with TMP-SMX for uncomplicated UTI caused by TMP-SMX-R microorganisms results in microbiologic and clinical failure. In high-resistance areas, TMP-SMX should not be the empiric drug of choice for uncomplicated UTI.

### Risk factors for trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole-resistant Escherichia coli in ED patients with urinary tract infections [^114CVrxj]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

While trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is recommended as one of the first-line empiric therapies for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis, institutions observing resistance rates exceeding 20% for Escherichia coli (E. coli) should utilize alternative empiric antibiotic therapy per the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines. Identifying risk factors associated with TMP-SMX resistance in E. coli may help guide empiric antibiotic prescribing for urinary tract infections (UTIs).
- **Methods**: This multicenter, retrospective study included adult patients who were discharged from 12 emergency departments (EDs) with a urine culture positive for E. coli between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2019. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between potential risk factors and TMP-SMX resistance. The overall institutional antimicrobial resistance rates for E. coli were compared to the rates seen in the study population of ED urinary isolates.
- **Results**: Among 427 patients included from a randomized sample of 500 with a urine culture positive for E. coli, 107 (25.1%) were resistant to TMP-SMX. Three predictors of TMP-SMX resistance were identified: reUTI (OR 2.27 [95% CI 1.27–3.99]), genitourinary abnormalities (OR 2.31 [95% CI 1.17–4.49]), and TMP-SMX use within 90 days (OR 8.77 [95% CI 3.19–28.12]). When the antibiotic susceptibilities for this ED cohort were compared to the institutional antibiogram, the TMP-SMX resistance rate was found to be higher in the ED population (25.1% vs. 20%).
- **Conclusions**: TMP-SMX should likely be avoided in settings with high detected resistance rates to improve empirical therapy effectiveness.

The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Low credibility.

There is a theoretical concern, unconfirmed by population-based challenge data, that clinically significant, immunologically mediated hypersensitivity occurs among β-lactams sharing side chains.
- **Objective**: To determine the population-based allergy incidence associated with the use of β-lactams sharing exact R1 side chains (ampicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor [ACC]), with or without an ACC allergy or a sulfonamide antibiotic allergy for comparison.
- **Methods**: All courses of ACC and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole used by any Kaiser Permanente California members in 2017 and 2018, with follow-up through January 2019, were identified along with their preexisting antibiotic allergy status and all new antibiotic-specific allergies reported within 30 days of course initiation.
- **Results**: A total of 1,167,713 courses of ACC were administered to individuals with no sulfonamide antibiotic or ACC allergy, and 4,771 new ACC allergies (0.41%) were reported. Moreover, 130,032 courses of ACC were administered to individuals with a sulfonamide antibiotic allergy and no ACC allergy, and 904 new ACC allergies (0.70%) were reported. There were 5,958 courses of ACC administered to individuals with an ACC allergy, 2,341 who also had a sulfonamide antibiotic allergy, and 52 new ACC allergies (0.87%) were reported.
- **Conclusions**: The incidence of new ACC allergy reports is minimally and non-specifically increased among individuals with a preexisting ACC or sulfonamide antibiotic allergy compared to the baseline incidence in the population. This argues against clinically significant…

### Diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections across age groups [^1135JKJ5]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are the most common outpatient infections. Predicting the probability of these infections through symptoms and test results can be complex. The most diagnostic symptoms include changes in frequency, dysuria, urgency, and the presence or absence of vaginal discharge. However, urinary tract infections may present differently in older women. Dipstick urinalysis is popular due to its availability and usefulness, but results must be interpreted in the context of the patient's pretest probability based on symptoms and characteristics.

In patients with a high probability of a urinary tract infection based on symptoms, a negative dipstick urinalysis does not rule out the infection. Nitrites are likely more sensitive and specific than other dipstick components, particularly in the elderly. While positive dipstick testing is likely specific for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy, urine culture remains the test of choice. Microscopic urinalysis is likely comparable to dipstick urinalysis as a screening test.

Bacteriuria is more specific and sensitive than pyuria for detecting urinary tract infection, even in older women and during pregnancy. Pyuria is commonly found in the absence of infection, particularly in older adults with lower urinary tract symptoms such as incontinence. Positive testing may increase the probability of infection, but the initiation of treatment should also consider the risk based on symptoms.

### Trimethoprim in vitro antibacterial activity is not increased by adding sulfamethoxazole for pediatric Escherichia coli urinary tract infection [^112Xcdhd]. The Journal of Urology (2010). Low credibility.

The combination of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is often used to treat uncomplicated urinary tract infections in children. The rationale for combining trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole is that they may act synergistically to increase antibacterial activity. However, approximately 3% of patients show allergic reactions to sulfamethoxazole, some of which are serious, such as liver failure and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. We determined whether adding sulfamethoxazole is necessary to increase in vitro antibacterial activity for pediatric urinary tract infection compared to that of trimethoprim alone.
- **Materials and methods**: We prospectively identified 1,298 children with urinary tract infection (greater than 100,000 cfu/ml Escherichia coli) from four American regions. In vitro susceptibility of bacterial isolates to sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was determined using disk diffusion. Ampicillin susceptibility was tested at two sites. At one site, all uropathogens from consecutive urinary isolates were evaluated.
- **Results**: E. coli susceptibility to trimethoprim was 70%, comparable to the 70% of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (p = 0.9) and higher than the 56.9% of sulfamethoxazole (p < 0.05). This susceptibility pattern was consistent across regions. At two sites, susceptibility to trimethoprim was significantly higher than to ampicillin. At one site, the susceptibility of other uropathogens to trimethoprim and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was similar to that of E. coli.
- **Conclusions**: In children with urinary tract infection, in vitro susceptibility to trimethoprim alone was sufficient, questioning the necessity of adding sulfamethoxazole in these cases.

### Outpatient antibiogram and predictors of ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistant urinary tract infections [^116DV2Di]. Annals of Family Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Rising antibiotic resistance has transcended hospital boundaries and impacted individuals with community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs). Scant data on antibiotic resistance in outpatient settings exist, and most studies in the United States (U.S.) have identified predictors of resistance in acute-care settings.

- **Objective**: Determine the antibiogram among Escherichia coli isolates and factors associated with ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) resistant gram-negative urinary isolates.

- **Study design**: Retrospective cohort study.

- **Setting**: Two primary care, safety-net clinics in Houston, TX, between November 2018 and March 2020.

- **Population studied**: Patients aged 18 and older presenting with provider-suspected uncomplicated or complicated UTIs.

- **Outcome measures**: Resistance and predictors of resistance to UTI-relevant antibiotics.

- **Results**: Among 1265 cultures collected, 372 (28.4%) were positive. E. coli (50.3%) and Group B Streptococcus (18.6%) were detected most frequently. The patient population consisted mostly of Hispanic (75.7%) females (92.5%) born outside the U.S. (67.3%) with a mean age of 47. Among patients with E. coli isolated (n = 189), antibiotic resistance was highest to ampicillin (63%), TMP-SMX (44%), ciprofloxacin (31%), and cefazolin (30%); no or low resistance against amikacin (0%), fosfomycin (0%), and nitrofurantoin (2.7%) was detected. Approximately 12% of E. coli isolates were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase positive. Having a prior UTI caused by a TMP-SMX resistant gram-negative organism and being born outside the U.S. increased the odds of similar future infections.

### Current prescribing practices and guideline concordance for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^1153i1uC]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections are one of the most common bacterial infections in the United States. Clinical practice guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fosfomycin as first-line antibiotic treatments and discourage the use of fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents. The US Food and Drug Administration released several black box warnings about fluoroquinolones over the past decade owing to antibiotic resistance and a high burden of adverse events. Historically, uncomplicated urinary tract infections have high rates of guideline-discordant treatment, with past studies noting substantial use of fluoroquinolones, directly contradicting clinical practice guidelines.
- **Objective**: This study aimed to assess the concordance of physician prescribing practices with Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women, and to identify patient and physician predictors of guideline concordance.
- **Study design**: A retrospective observational secondary analysis was conducted using a series of cross-sectional data extracted from the IQVIA (Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania) National Disease and Therapeutic Index from 2015 to 2019. An estimated 44.9 million women with uncomplicated urinary tract infections, aged 18 to 75 years, were treated as outpatients. This population was selected to lack relevant comorbidities or urological abnormalities so that it matched the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines.

### Is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy non-inferior to antibiotic therapy in uncomplicated urinary tract infections: a systematic review [^113955L9]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Even patients with "positive" urine cultures may have asymptomatic bacteriuria and thus not require treatment. Misdiagnosis of UTIs is particularly common in elderly women who have other long-standing urinary tract symptoms, such as incontinence. However, the maximum age cutoffs used in four out of five studies (50 to 70 years of age) likely avoided some challenges of diagnosing UTIs in the elderly, while also limiting generalizability to these groups. Although there is a subset of individuals who clearly benefit from antibiotics, there is likely another segment that does not benefit from antibiotics and could be appropriately treated with NSAIDs or no therapy.

Another important finding from the included studies was that only 2.0–4.5% of individuals treated with NSAIDs subsequently developed pyelonephritis, based on three studies with 1130 patients. To avoid one case of pyelonephritis, 22 to 62 people would need to be treated with antibiotics. Notably, these reported rates of pyelonephritis in NSAID groups were higher than placebo arms of prior clinical trials (0.4% and 2.6%). While better follow-up to assess outcomes in the NSAID studies may be partially responsible, NSAIDs have also been associated with worse outcomes in other infections, such as community-acquired pneumonia, possibly due to immune suppression. These and other potential adverse effects of NSAIDs must be better understood before these drugs can be used for uncomplicated UTIs.

In summary, this review demonstrates the superiority of antibiotics over NSAIDs for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections.

### Diagnosis and management of uncomplicated urinary tract infections [^1156Fvm4]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Most uncomplicated urinary tract infections occur in women who are sexually active, with far fewer cases occurring in older women, those who are pregnant, and in men. Although the incidence of urinary tract infections has not changed substantially over the last 10 years, the diagnostic criteria, bacterial resistance patterns, and recommended treatment have changed. Escherichia coli is the leading cause of urinary tract infections, followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been the standard therapy for urinary tract infections; however, E. coli is becoming increasingly resistant to medications. Many experts support using ciprofloxacin as an alternative and, in some cases, as the preferred first-line agent. However, others caution that widespread use of ciprofloxacin will promote increased resistance.

### Emerging antibiotic resistance in urinary tract pathogens [^116PmcFf]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

In vitro antimicrobial resistance is an evolving and growing problem in urinary tract infections (UTI). Much of the increase is occurring in acute uncomplicated cystitis, an infection that has traditionally been simple to treat. The trend of rising TMP-SMX and beta-lactam resistance rates is worrisome. Of more concern, however, are the emerging issues of fluoroquinolone resistance and multidrug resistance (MDR) among community-acquired urinary isolates.

Judicious use of antibiotics and the development of novel non-antimicrobial-based methods for the prevention of UTIs are important strategies to help slow the progression of resistance. Meanwhile, ongoing surveillance of resistance trends and enhanced understanding of the determinants of resistance are crucial for the optimal management of UTIs.

### Urinary tract infection in women over the age of 65: Is age alone a marker of complication [^112bWJbi]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

We were interested to know if our older female patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) might have differing pathogens or rates of Escherichia coli antibiotic sensitivity, and if our physicians managed them in a manner similar or dissimilar to the care provided to younger patients with no complications.
- **Methods**: This was a secondary analysis from patients excluded from a previous retrospective study regarding uncomplicated UTIs.
- **Results**: Twenty-six percent of total patients with UTIs were older than 65 and otherwise medically uncomplicated, whereas 21% were older patients who did have complicating factors. E. coli was a pathogen in 81% of uncomplicated elders' and 54% of complicated elders' cultures. E. coli sensitivity rate to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) in both groups was 86%. Physicians were significantly less likely to prescribe SMX/TMP for complicated older patients with complications than for young patients with an uncomplicated UTI (P = 0.017); there was a significant trend of physicians to be less likely to prescribe SMX/TMP with advancing age in a patient and complications across all 3 groups (P = 0.011). Antibiotics rarely needed to be changed after cultures.
- **Conclusions**: The presence of E. coli on culture in patients with a UTI changes based on medical complications, not age. Being medically complex did not result in reduced sensitivity of E. coli to SMX/TMP but was associated with increased rates of the presence of other pathogens. In our setting, treatment employed with SMX/TMP and without the use of culture and sensitivity may be effective.

### Antimicrobial agents for treating uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women [^114PmJ6k]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). High credibility.

Acute uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common problems for which young women seek medical attention.
- **Objectives**: To compare the efficacy, resistance development, and safety of different antimicrobial treatments for acute uncomplicated lower UTI.
- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialized Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and bibliographies of included studies.
- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different classes of antimicrobials for acute uncomplicated UTI in women were included. The outcomes of interest were symptomatic and bacteriological cure at short and long-term follow-up, resistance development, number of days to symptom resolution, days of work loss, adverse events, and complications.
- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently extracted the data and assessed study quality. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model, and the results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
- **Main results**: Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) was as effective as fluoroquinolones in achieving short-term (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.03) and long-term (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.05) symptomatic cure. Beta-lactam drugs were as effective as TMP-SMX for short-term (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.12) and long-term (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21) symptomatic cure. Short-term cure for nitrofurantoin was similar to that of TMP-SMX (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.04) as was long-term symptomatic cure.

### Urinary tract infections: Diagnosis and management in the emergency department [^116BApmD]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

With the emergence of increasing resistance to common antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs), including ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), the choice of antibiotics for these infections has become more challenging. This article reviews the evidence-based guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of cystitis and pyelonephritis in the emergency department. It includes a discussion on the pathophysiology and describes the initial diagnostic workup, with particular attention to the urine dipstick. The usefulness of hospital antibiograms in deciding the initial antibiotic choice is also evaluated.
- **Treatment recommendations**: The treatment section reviews the recommendations and highlights the use of nitrofurantoin in the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs. The appropriate use of ciprofloxacin and TMP-SMX in the treatment of UTIs is also discussed.

### Effect of 7 vs 14 days of antibiotic therapy on resolution of symptoms among afebrile men with urinary tract infection: A randomized clinical trial [^1171F9GK]. JAMA (2021). High credibility.

Determination of optimal treatment durations for common infectious diseases is an important strategy to preserve antibiotic effectiveness. This study aims to determine whether 7 days of treatment is noninferior to 14 days when using ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for treating urinary tract infections (UTI) in afebrile men.

This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled noninferiority trial conducted at two US Veterans Affairs medical centers from April 2014 through December 2019, with final follow-up on January 28, 2020. Out of 1058 eligible men, 272 were randomized.

Participants continued the antibiotic prescribed by their treating clinician for 7 days and were then randomized to receive either continued antibiotic therapy (n = 136) or a placebo (n = 136) for days 8 to 14 of treatment.
- **Main outcomes and measures**:
	- The prespecified primary outcome was the resolution of UTI symptoms by 14 days after the completion of active antibiotic treatment. A noninferiority margin of 10% was selected. The primary analysis included the as-treated population, consisting of participants who took at least 26 out of 28 doses and missed no more than 2 consecutive doses. A secondary analysis included all patients as randomized, regardless of treatment adherence. Secondary outcomes included recurrence of UTI symptoms and/or adverse events within 28 days of stopping study medication.

Among 272 patients with a median age of 69 years (interquartile range: 62–73 years), the study found that…

### Allergies to sulfonamide antibiotics and sulfur-containing drugs [^113i3tBH]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this paper is to provide a literature review and clinical summary of the evaluation and management of sulfonamide drug reactions.
- **Data sources**: Published English-language medical literature.
- **Study selection**: Selected trials of drug desensitization protocols.
- **Results**: Obtaining a detailed history is invaluable in assessing a history of reactions to sulfonamide medications because allergy to these drugs remains a clinical diagnosis at present. Numerous efficacious drug desensitization protocols for management have been published and are reviewed in detail.
- **Conclusions**: The term sulfa allergy is imprecise and misleading and therefore should be discouraged. There are important distinctions between sulfonylarylamines (antimicrobial sulfonamides), nonarylamine (nonantimicrobial) sulfonamides, and sulfones with regard to allergic and other adverse drug reactions. Most reactions to sulfonylarylamines probably result from multifactorial immunologic and toxic metabolic mechanisms, whereas less is known about the precise mechanisms of reactions to other sulfur-containing drugs.

### Impact of allergy and resistance on antibiotic selection for recurrent urinary tract infections in older women [^1174ofgk]. Urology (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to review the impact of antibiotic allergy and resistance in older women with recurrent urinary tract infections (RUTIs), as determinants for a suitable oral antibiotic treatment choice.

- **Methods**: A prospectively maintained database of women 65 years and older with documented RUTIs (≥ 3 UTIs per year) and trigonitis on cystoscopy was reviewed. Demographic data, known drug allergies, renal function, and antibiotic susceptibility of the most recent urine culture were obtained. The focus was on allergy or resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), fluoroquinolones, and nitrofurantoin.

- **Results**: From 2006 to 2014, 86 women with RUTIs met the study criteria. The mean age was 77.9 ± 7.8 years, with 94% being Caucasian. An estimated glomerular filtration rate greater than 30 mL/min was noted in 94% of the participants. The percentages of women allergic, resistant, or both allergic and resistant to TMP-SMX were 33%, 29%, and 15%, respectively; to fluoroquinolones, 14%, 34%, and 8.1%; and to nitrofurantoin, 16%, 14%, and 5%. Twenty-eight percent (24 of 86) of women who were allergic and/or resistant to TMP-SMX and fluoroquinolones were sensitive to nitrofurantoin. Twenty percent (17 of 86) were allergic and/or resistant to all three antibiotics. Women who were allergic or resistant to TMP-SMX had a significantly higher number of other antibiotic resistances compared to women sensitive to TMP-SMX (4.9 ± 3.6 vs. 2.1 ± 2.3; P < .0001). Similarly, women with fluoroquinolone allergy or resistance had significantly more antibiotic resistances than those who were fluoroquinolone sensitive (5.8 ± 3.5 vs. 2.3 ± 2.5; P < .0001).

- **Conclusion**: Because of allergy and resistance concerns, selecting an appropriate antibiotic treatment for older women with RUTIs is complex and requires consideration of individual susceptibility profiles.

### Duration of antibacterial treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women [^114RLvXD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common disease, frequently occurring in young sexually active women. Traditionally, seven-day antibiotic therapy was recommended; however, the current practice is to treat uncomplicated UTI for three days.
- **Objectives**: To compare the efficacy and safety of three-day antibiotic therapy to multi-day therapy (five days or longer) on relief of symptoms and bacteriuria at short-term and long-term follow-up.
- **Search strategy**: The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2004), the Cochrane Renal Group's Register of Trials (July 2003), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2003), and MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2003) were searched. References of all included studies were scanned, and the first or corresponding author of included trials and the pharmaceutical companies were contacted.
- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials comparing three-day oral antibiotic therapy with multi-day therapy (five days and longer) for uncomplicated cystitis in 18 to 65-year-old non-pregnant women without signs of upper UTI were selected.
- **Data collection and analysis**: Data concerning bacteriological and symptomatic failure rates, occurrence of pyelonephritis, and adverse effects were extracted independently by two reviewers. Relative risk (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Outcomes were also extracted by intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible.
- **Main results**: Thirty-two trials (9605 patients) were included. For symptomatic failure rates, no difference between three-day and 5 to 10-day antibiotic regimens was observed short-term (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88).

### Addressing antibiotic resistance [^112N6hvV]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The management of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) has traditionally been based on two important principles: the spectrum of organisms causing acute UTI is highly predictable, with Escherichia coli accounting for 75% to 90% and Staphylococcus saprophyticus accounting for 5% to 15% of isolates, and the susceptibility patterns of these organisms have also been relatively predictable. As a result, empiric therapy with short-course trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) has been a standard management approach for uncomplicated cystitis. However, antibiotic resistance is now becoming a major factor not only in nosocomial complicated UTIs but also in uncomplicated community-acquired UTIs. Resistance to TMP-SMX now approaches 18% to 22% in some regions of the United States, and nearly 1 in 3 bacterial strains causing cystitis or pyelonephritis demonstrate resistance to amoxicillin. Fortunately, resistance to other agents, such as nitrofurantoin and the fluoroquinolones, has remained low, at approximately 2%.

Preliminary data suggest that the increase in TMP-SMX resistance is associated with poorer bacteriologic and clinical outcomes when TMP-SMX is used for therapy. These trends have necessitated a change in the management approach to community-acquired UTI. The use of TMP-SMX as a first-line agent for empiric therapy of uncomplicated cystitis is only appropriate in areas where TMP-SMX resistance prevalence is less than 10% to 20%. In areas where resistance to TMP-SMX exceeds this rate, alternative agents need to be considered.

### Antibiotic resistance of urinary tract infection recurrences in a large integrated US healthcare system [^116BPB2S]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Since the 1940s, various antibiotics have been recommended for the treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs). However, growing antibiotic resistance has contributed to the recurrence and chronicity of UTIs, making their treatment increasingly complicated. A substantial increase in UTIs resistant to penicillins and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) has been reported. Co-resistance to ampicillin and TMP-SMX, and multidrug resistance (MDR) involving ampicillin, TMP-SMX, and ciprofloxacin have also been commonly reported in the US.

US surveillance data from 2000 reported MDR in 7% of Escherichia coli, including resistance to ampicillin (98%), TMP-SMX (93%), cephalosporin (87%), ciprofloxacin (39%), and nitrofurantoin (8%) among the resistant isolates. More recently, a study from Italy of over 30,000 E. coli urine isolates found that resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics increased significantly between 2000 and 2019. Isolates collected from 2015 to 2019 showed 30% resistance to ciprofloxacin, 24% to TMP-SMX, and over 10% to third-generation cephalosporins, with 17% MDR and 12% extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producers.

Another study evaluating MDR among expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales (ESCR-E) found that 91% of ESCR-E uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) causing UTIs had an ESBL phenotype. Furthermore, ESCR-E UPEC with ESBL were 1.7 times more likely to be MDR than non-ESBL isolates.

### Global epidemiology of urinary tract infections [^113uRQsN]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Both in the community and hospital setting, urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common. Initial appropriate empirical treatment requires a good knowledge of epidemiological data. In this review, the most recent global epidemiological data of UTIs have been summarized.
- **Recent findings**: Community-associated UTI (CAUTI) prevalence is 0.7%, and the main risk factors are age, history of UTI, sexual activity, and diabetes. The most common pathogen is Escherichia coli, and resistance rates to common antibiotics depend significantly on geographical location. The lowest observed resistance was for fosfomycin (range: 0–2.9%), nitrofurantoin (range: 0–4.4%), and mecillinam (range: 0–4%). Healthcare-associated UTI (HAUTI) frequency among healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) is reported as 12.9% (confidence interval: 10.2–16%) in the United States, 19.6% in Europe, and 24% in developing countries. In urology departments, the prevalence is 5.1%. Resistance to almost all antibiotics in HAUTIs is above 20%, with significant geographical variation. The community-onset HAUTIs bacterial spectrum is similar to hospital-onset HAUTIs and different from CAUTIs.
- **Summary**: It is challenging to provide an exact frequency of UTIs. Both CAUTI and HAUTI frequency, pathogen spectrum, and resistance rates vary according to geographical setting.

### Assessment of nationally recommended antibiotics for treatment of UTI in U.S.-Mexico border emergency departments [^113akXHC]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) seen in the emergency department are commonly treated on an outpatient basis with oral antibiotics. Given that antibiotics are available for over-the-counter purchase in Mexico, there is speculation that potential misuse and overuse of antibiotics in United States-Mexico border areas could lead to antibiotic resistance patterns that would render some empiric treatments for UTIs less effective. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) guideline-recommended antibiotics for the treatment of outpatient UTI diagnosed in the emergency department. Data were collected from a county hospital on the U.S.-Mexico border within a metropolitan area of over 2 million people. Secondary analysis included the frequency of urine culture isolation, resistance rates of urine pathogens, and prescriber habits.
- **Methods**: This study was a retrospective chart review of adult patients diagnosed and treated for UTI from August 1, 2019, to February 29, 2020. Culture results of included patients were analyzed against in vitro-tested antibiotics. Bacterial isolate frequency, resistance rates, and prescribing habits were collected.
- **Results**: A total of 985 patient charts were reviewed, with 520 patients meeting the inclusion criteria for analysis of prescribing habits. Of these, 329 positive bacterial culture growths were included in the analysis of antibiotic resistance rates. Oral antibiotics with comparatively lower resistance rates were amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefdinir, cefuroxime, and nitrofurantoin.

### Trimethoprim use for urinary tract infection and risk of adverse outcomes in older patients: Cohort study [^114pht5t]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Co-trimoxazole is a combination antibiotic drug containing trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, prescribed for multiple indications, and is the fourth most commonly prescribed antibiotic in the United States. Its use has been associated with an increased risk of sudden death among people taking renin-angiotensin system blockers. This may be owing to acute kidney injury, a rapid deterioration in kidney function. Alternatively, co-trimoxazole and trimethoprim alone have both been associated with an increased risk of an acute rise in potassium levels, hyperkalaemia, which can cause fatal cardiac arrhythmias.

Existing evidence has important limitations. It is not clear if the association between co-trimoxazole and adverse outcomes is owing to the sulfamethoxazole or the trimethoprim component. The observed association may be owing to confounding if the combination antibiotic was used for patients with more severe infections than the antibiotics it was compared with. Finally, existing evidence is primarily associated with specific groups of patients, such as those taking renin-angiotensin system blockers. In the UK, co-trimoxazole is licensed for specific, uncommon indications, and trimethoprim is more commonly used. However, there are efforts to reduce trimethoprim prescribing due to increasing antimicrobial resistance. In 2015, over 3.7 million prescriptions for trimethoprim were dispensed in England, and it remains a first-line option for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). Despite this, whether trimethoprim alone is linked to sudden death in the general population remains a concern.

### Evaluation of a therapeutic vaccine for the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections versus prophylactic treatment with antibiotics [^113GnAQ9]. International Urogynecology Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Continuous prophylaxis with antibiotics is the recommended initial therapy for recurrent urinary tract infections (RUTIs). Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) for a period of 6 months is the most commonly recommended option. However, the continuous use of antibiotics is not free of risk. Multiresistance of bacteria to antibiotics is widely increasing, creating the dramatic situation wherein more than 40% of bacterial strains are resistant to available antibiotics in some regions of the world. An added problem is the high incidence of adverse reactions associated with the use of antibiotics and other chemotherapeutics.

Therefore, it is reasonable to consider other preventive strategies, such as those that reinforce the natural mechanisms of pathogen defense. The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical benefit obtained with the prophylactic use of a bacterial-based sublingual vaccine (Uromune®) compared with prophylactic treatment with SMX/TMP to prevent recurrences of urinary tract infections (UTIs).

### Antibiotics dispensed to privately insured pregnant women with urinary tract infections - United States, 2014 [^112ph6V3]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

According to 2011 guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America, nonpregnant women with uncomplicated UTIs should be treated with nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. For pregnant women in their first trimester, a 2011 committee opinion from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended that sulfonamides and nitrofurantoin may be prescribed only if other antimicrobial therapies are deemed clinically inappropriate. In this analysis, 34.7% of pregnant women with UTIs in 2014 filled a prescription for nitrofurantoin, and 7.6% filled a prescription for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole during their first trimester of pregnancy.

Few estimates of UTI treatment of pregnant women are available, though the estimate is similar to a previous report of approximately 700 mothers of liveborn infants without major birth defects enrolled in a large, multisite, population-based case-control study of risk factors for major birth defects from 1997 to 2011. In that study, approximately 6.7% of pregnant women reported at least one UTI from the month before conception through the third month of pregnancy, and two-thirds (66.6%) reported antibiotic treatment, similar to the prevalence observed in this analysis.

The estimates of antibiotic treatment for UTIs during the three months before LMP are similar to estimates from previous studies of nonpregnant women. A 2003 study examined approximately 13,000 claims among women aged 18–75 years with acute cystitis enrolled in a preferred provider care organization during 1997–1999.

### Antibiotic duration for treating uncomplicated, symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women [^114giEYo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are common in elderly patients. Authors of nonsystematic literature reviews often recommend longer treatment durations (7–14 days) for older patients than for younger women, but the scientific evidence for such recommendations is not clear.
- **Objectives**: To determine the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women.
- **Search strategy**: We contacted known investigators and pharmaceutical companies marketing antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections, screened the reference list of identified articles, reviews, and books, and searched the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Healthstar, Popline, Gerolit, Bioethics Line, The Cochrane Library, Dissertation Abstracts International, and Index to Scientific & Technical Proceedings.
- **Selection criteria**: All randomized controlled trials in which different treatment durations of oral antibiotics for uncomplicated symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women were compared. We excluded patients with fever or flank pain and those with complicating factors. Trials with treatment durations longer than 14 days or designed for prevention of urinary tract infection were also excluded. No language restriction was applied.
- **Data collection and analysis**: The quality of all selected trials was assessed and data extracted by the reviewers. Main outcome measures were persistence of urinary symptoms (short-term and long-term efficacy), effect on mental and functional status, and adverse drug reactions.

### Alternative to prophylactic antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: Multicentre, open label, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^115Aib5q]. BMJ (2022). High credibility.

The primary clinical outcome measure was the incidence of symptomatic, antibiotic-treated urinary tract infection (UTI) episodes self-reported by participants over the 12-month treatment period. An episode of UTI was defined as the presence of at least one symptom reported by patients or clinicians from a predefined list produced by Public Health England, together with the taking of a discrete treatment course of antibiotics for UTI. Consequently, the occurrence of the primary outcome was always defined by the independent prescribing clinician via confirmation of the likely diagnosis and recommendation of antibiotic treatment. The end of one UTI episode was defined as 14 days after the final antibiotic dose. If symptoms restarted or further antibiotics were prescribed within 14 days, this event was counted as the same episode.
- **Secondary outcomes**: The incidence of symptomatic, antibiotic-treated UTI in the six months after treatment; microbiologically confirmed UTIs; antibiotic resistance profiles in Escherichia coli isolated from urine and perineal swabs; asymptomatic bacteriuria; total antibiotic use; and hospital admissions due to UTI. Participant satisfaction with treatment was measured using the treatment satisfaction questionnaire for medication, which assessed four domains of treatment satisfaction: effectiveness, side effects, convenience, and global satisfaction.

Microbiologically confirmed UTIs were episodes defined as per the primary outcome but with an additional criterion of positive urine culture at the time of UTI. A positive urine culture was defined as one isolate of the pathogen.
