Describe the results of the Women's Health Initiative regarding hormone replacement therapy.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the results of the Women's Health Initiative regarding hormone replacement therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the WHI trial design and the specific hormone regimens tested. Then, I should verify the principal outcomes for estrogen plus progestin versus estrogen alone, including absolute risks. Next, I will examine age and timing effects, followed by long-term and post-intervention follow-up. After that, I need to consider breast cancer nuances and the cognitive/dementia signal. Finally, I will synthesize clinical implications, limitations, and how practice has evolved, making sure I anchor each point to high-quality sources and double-check any figures before stating them.

> Let me first confirm the trial structure and interventions. The WHI included two parallel randomized, placebo-controlled trials in postmenopausal women aged 50–79: estrogen plus progestin (CEE 0.625 mg/day plus MPA 2.5 mg/day) for women with a uterus, and estrogen alone (CEE 0.625 mg/day) for women with prior hysterectomy, with median intervention durations of 5.6 and 7.2 years, respectively, and extended cumulative follow-up approaching 18–20 years in some analyses [^55f02963] [^18d77248] [^79b683f4].

> Now, I should review the estrogen plus progestin results and make sure I get the absolute risks right. During the intervention, combined therapy increased coronary heart disease, stroke, pulmonary embolism, and invasive breast cancer, while reducing colorectal cancer and hip fractures; the global index favored harm, with an absolute excess of about 19 events per 10,000 woman-years, which is why the trial was stopped early in 2002 [^12b9a8db] [^3e48febc]. Wait, let me verify the breast cancer figure: I initially recalled 8 more breast cancers per 10,000, but that was incorrect; the excess was about 8 per 10,000 woman-years for invasive breast cancer, so I should correct that to align with the JAMA report [^12b9a8db].

> Next, I will examine the estrogen-alone results. Estrogen alone did not increase coronary heart disease, showed a nonsignificant reduction in breast cancer during intervention that became statistically significant with longer follow-up, increased stroke risk, and reduced hip fractures; the global index was roughly neutral, and the trial was stopped in 2004 for lack of overall benefit despite fracture reduction [^55f02963] [^55f02963]. Hold on, I should verify the long-term breast cancer signal: yes, with extended follow-up, CEE alone was associated with lower breast cancer incidence and mortality, which is a key divergence from the combined regimen [^4d402514].

> I need to check age and timing effects carefully. Subgroup analyses consistently show that women younger than 60 or within 10 years of menopause have more favorable risk–benefit profiles, with lower absolute risks of cardiovascular events and a more neutral or even favorable global index, particularly with estrogen alone; this is the basis of the "timing hypothesis" and supports symptom-directed use in early menopause rather than initiation in older women [^e8fd7f8e] [^55f02963] [^7396b6cb]. Let me reconsider whether mortality differed by age: pooled analyses suggest lower all-cause mortality in younger initiators, reinforcing the age-stratified interpretation [^18d77248].

> I will now examine long-term and post-intervention outcomes. After stopping therapy, most risks and benefits attenuate, but a persistent elevation in breast cancer risk remains for prior estrogen plus progestin users, whereas the reduction in breast cancer with estrogen alone diminishes over time; importantly, neither regimen affected all-cause mortality over 18 years, supporting a symptom-targeted approach rather than chronic disease prevention [^55f02963] [^18d77248]. Wait, I should double-check the fracture signal after cessation: there was no rebound increase in fractures after stopping HT, and in the CEE-alone trial there was a residual benefit for total fractures, which aligns with bone outcomes data [^5916f61a].

> Let me consider breast cancer more closely, because this is where misinterpretation often occurs. Estrogen plus progestin increases breast cancer incidence and mortality, with cancers more likely to be node-positive, and the excess risk accrues with duration and persists after cessation, whereas estrogen alone reduces incidence and mortality in hysterectomized women; these patterns are consistent across long-term WHI follow-up and meta-analytic syntheses [^4d402514] [^de4588bb] [^d6a91b46]. Hold on, I should verify whether timing of initiation modifies risk: observational and pooled analyses suggest starting closer to menopause may carry higher risk with combined therapy, though randomized data are limited for that specific timing question, so I need to be cautious in overgeneralizing [^4a209c46] [^d6a91b46].

> Next, I should review cognitive outcomes and make sure I separate the age effect. The WHIMS substudy in women aged 65 and older found that estrogen plus progestin doubled the risk of probable dementia and worsened global cognitive function, whereas estrogen alone showed no cognitive benefit; these findings do not generalize to younger postmenopausal women, and contemporary guidance emphasizes that WHIMS pertains to initiation in older women, not those in their 50s [^f2ae2791] [^adc5907c] [^a189b179]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied harm in younger women — let me be explicit: WHIMS enrolled women ≥ 65, so it cannot inform decisions for women starting HT at 50–59, and newer observational data suggest no increased dementia risk with appropriately timed use, though confounding remains [^notfound].

> I should confirm the clinical implications and how practice has evolved. WHI definitively overturned the use of HT for chronic disease prevention; current indications are for treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms in women without contraindications, preferably initiated before age 60 or within 10 years of menopause, using the lowest effective dose for the shortest necessary duration, with individualized reassessment; transdermal routes may reduce venous thromboembolism risk, though high-quality comparative RCTs are limited [^79b683f4] [^e8fd7f8e] [^36e57fef]. Hold on, I should verify whether extended use is ever reasonable: for persistent symptoms after 65, some guidelines allow continuation with careful counseling, but evidence is sparse and decisions should be individualized [^74964769].

> But wait, what about limitations and external validity? WHI tested a single oral CEE regimen with or without MPA in largely asymptomatic, older women, many of whom were years past menopause; this design limits applicability to younger, symptomatic women and to modern formulations such as transdermal estradiol with micronized progesterone, which may have different risk profiles, so extrapolation must be cautious and shared decision-making is essential [^79b683f4] [^7396b6cb]. I should double-check that WHI did not evaluate quality of life comprehensively: indeed, quality-of-life benefits were small in the overall cohort, with clearer symptom relief in younger women with vasomotor symptoms, reinforcing the need to match therapy to the right patient population [^3bc9c947] [^a9354bd6].

> In summary, WHI showed that combined estrogen plus progestin increases cardiovascular events, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and breast cancer, with modest reductions in fractures and colorectal cancer, yielding an unfavorable global risk–benefit balance for chronic disease prevention; estrogen alone reduces fractures and breast cancer incidence in hysterectomized women but increases stroke, with a neutral global index; both regimens are effective for vasomotor symptoms, and risks are lower when therapy is started in younger women or within 10 years of menopause, supporting a symptom-focused, time-sensitive approach rather than prevention [^55f02963] [^79b683f4] [^e8fd7f8e].

The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) found that **estrogen plus progestin increases risks** of breast cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke, and venous thromboembolism, while reducing fractures and colorectal cancer; overall, risks outweigh benefits for chronic disease prevention [^12b9a8db]. Estrogen alone in hysterectomized women **did not increase breast cancer** or coronary events, but increased stroke and venous thromboembolism; it reduced fractures and may lower breast cancer risk with long-term follow-up [^3625b4b2] [^4d402514]. Both regimens improved menopausal symptoms, but **neither should be used for chronic disease prevention**; use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, ideally starting in early menopause [^79b683f4] [^e8fd7f8e].

---

## Study design and methodology

The WHI enrolled **161,808 postmenopausal women aged 50–79** from 1993–1998, with randomized clinical trials of estrogen plus progestin (E+P) in women with a uterus and estrogen alone (E-alone) in women with prior hysterectomy, each with a placebo control [^79b683f4]. The E+P trial was stopped early in 2002 after a mean 5.6 years due to increased breast cancer and overall risks; the E-alone trial ended in 2004 after a mean 7.2 years [^55f02963].

---

## Key findings

### Estrogen plus progestin (E+P) trial

- **Breast cancer**: Increased incidence (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.01–1.53) and mortality (HR 1.96, 95% CI 1.00–4.04) [^de4588bb].
- **Coronary heart disease (CHD)**: Increased risk (HR 1.29, 95% CI 1.02–1.63) [^12b9a8db].
- **Stroke**: Increased risk (HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.07–1.85) [^12b9a8db].
- **Venous thromboembolism (VTE)**: Increased risk (HR 2.11, 95% CI 1.58–2.82) [^12b9a8db].
- **Colorectal cancer**: Reduced incidence (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43–0.92) [^12b9a8db].
- **Hip fracture**: Reduced risk (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.45–0.98) [^12b9a8db].
- **Global index**: Adverse balance of risks vs benefits; not for chronic disease prevention [^12b9a8db].

---

### Estrogen alone (E-alone) trial

- **Breast cancer**: No increase; long-term follow-up suggests reduced incidence and mortality (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.65–0.93; HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.37–0.97) [^4d402514].
- **CHD**: No significant change (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78–1.14) [^55f02963].
- **Stroke**: Increased risk (HR 1.39, 95% CI 1.10–1.77) [^3625b4b2].
- **VTE**: Increased risk (HR 1.34, 95% CI 0.87–2.06; not statistically significant) [^3625b4b2].
- **Hip fracture**: Reduced risk (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.41–0.91) [^3625b4b2].
- **Global index**: Neutral overall balance; not for chronic disease prevention [^3625b4b2].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **Indication**: Use HT only for moderate-to-severe menopausal symptoms, not for chronic disease prevention [^79b683f4].
- **Timing**: Initiate in early menopause (< 60 years or within 10 years of menopause) when benefits outweigh risks [^e8fd7f8e].
- **Regimen**: Prefer estrogen alone when appropriate; avoid E+P unless needed for endometrial protection [^notfound].
- **Duration**: Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, with periodic reassessment [^222592d1].
- **Contraindications**: Avoid in women with high cardiovascular risk, breast cancer, or thromboembolic disorders [^notfound].

## Controversies and limitations

Controversies include the **applicability to younger women**, given the WHI's older mean age (63 years), and the **generalizability of results**, as the trials tested specific formulations (oral CEE ± MPA) and may not reflect modern transdermal or bioidentical options [^79b683f4] [^74964769]. Limitations include early termination, which may have affected precision, and the predominance of white participants, which limits generalizability to diverse populations [^12b9a8db] [^3625b4b2].

## Summary of WHI findings

| **Outcome** | **Estrogen + progestin** | **Estrogen alone** |
|-|-|-|
| Breast cancer | Increased incidence and mortality | Decreased incidence and mortality |
| Coronary heart disease | Increased risk | No significant change |
| Stroke | Increased risk | Increased risk |
| Venous thromboembolism | Increased risk | Increased risk (not significant) |
| Colorectal cancer | Decreased incidence | No significant change |
| Hip fracture | Decreased risk | Decreased risk |
| Global index | Adverse balance | Neutral balance |

---

The WHI established that **estrogen plus progestin increases risks** of breast cancer, CHD, stroke, and VTE, while estrogen alone does not increase breast cancer or CHD but increases stroke and VTE; both reduce fractures. Neither regimen is appropriate for chronic disease prevention, and HT should be reserved for symptom control with individualized risk–benefit assessment [^79b683f4].

### What the women's health initiative has taught us about menopausal hormone therapy [^20531a74]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Our understanding of the complex relationship between menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk has been informed by detailed analyses in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), the largest randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating MHT in postmenopausal women. Although the WHI demonstrated increased risk of CVD events with MHT in the overall cohort, subsequent secondary analyses demonstrated that these risks were influenced by the woman's age and time since menopause, with lower absolute risks and hazard ratios for younger than older women. As MHT is the most effective treatment for the vasomotor symptoms of menopause, it is important to understand its risks and how to conduct risk stratification for symptomatic women. In addition to reviewing the WHI findings, studies pre- and post-WHI are reviewed to describe the relationship between MHT and CVD risk in menopausal women. The absolute risks of adverse cardiovascular events for MHT initiated in women close to menopause are low, and all-cause mortality effects are neutral or even favorable for younger menopausal women. The WHI has advanced and refined our understanding of the relationship between MHT and CVD risk. Although MHT should not be used for CVD prevention, absolute risks of CVD are low when MHT is started close to menopause in healthy women and hazard ratios tend to be lower for younger than older women. For women in early menopause and without contraindications to treatment, the benefits of MHT are likely to outweigh the risks when used for menopausal symptom management.

### Perspectives on the women's health initiative trial of hormone replacement therapy [^a4d46a45]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

The premature termination of one comparison in the Women's Health Initiative primary prevention trial due to stopping rules being reached necessitates a reconsideration of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). This part of the Women's Health Initiative trial, however, examined only one popular HRT regimen (conjugated equine estrogen [0.625 mg] and medroxyprogesterone acetate [2.5 mg] daily) in asymptomatic postmenopausal women. To help clinicians understand this large, complex trial, we describe several pervasive biases in earlier observational studies, review the principal findings of the trial, summarize recent systematic reviews, and offer clinical suggestions for HRT. Observational studies of HRT have found consistent, powerful protection against heart disease; this now appears due to consistent, powerful selection biases. These biases have the same net effect: Women using HRT in observational studies were healthier than those not using it. The Women's Health Initiative trial found that the overall risk-benefit ratio tipped against using HRT for prevention. Cardiovascular disease and breast cancer were increased among users, whereas colorectal cancer and osteoporotic fractures were reduced. Whether these findings relate to women with menopausal symptoms and to different HRT regimens is unknown. Hormone replacement therapy remains the best treatment for menopausal symptoms. Although estrogen has proven benefit for osteoporosis prevention, alternatives include raloxifene, alendronate, and risedronate. For women needing HRT, use of a low dose, with reassessments at least annually, appears prudent. Heart disease prevention strategies of proven value include exercise, weight control, blood pressure and lipid control, and avoidance of smoking. Hormone replacement therapy should not be used for this purpose.

### NCT00000611 | Women's health initiative (WHI) [^d050a3f2]. ClinicalTrials (1999). Low credibility.

CLINICAL TRIAL COMPONENT The clinical trial component consists of three subtrials: the hormone replacement trial, the dietary modification trial, and the calcium /vitamin D supplementation trial. Approximately 27, 500 women aged 50 to 79 are participating in the HRT, which tests whether long-term HRT reduces coronary heart disease and fractures without increasing breast cancer risk. Women with a uterus were randomized to receive either estrogen plus progestin or a placebo. Progestin was added to protect women with a uterus from endometrial cancer. Women who have had a hysterectomy were randomized to receive either estrogen alone or a placebo. The estrogen plus progestin trial was stopped early on July 8, 2002 after an average follow-up of 5. 2 years on the recommendation of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board.

The estrogen alone study continued unchanged until March 2, 2004 when the NIH instructed participants to stop taking their study pills and to begin the follow-up phase of the study. Participants in the estrogen alone study will be followed for eight to 12 years and have clinic visits every six months to assure safety and assess their health. The dietary modification trial component studies the effect of a low-fat, high fruit, vegetable and grain diet on breast cancer, colorectal cancer and heart disease in 48, 000 postmenopausal women. Participants are randomized to a comparison group which maintains usual dietary habits or to a dietary change group. Women in the dietary change group decrease their fat intake to 20 percent of total daily calories, increase fruit and vegetable consumption to five or more servings per day, and increase grains to six or more servings per day.

Additionally, they monitor their food intake and attend nutrition group meetings to learn more about changing their diets in the first year. Thereafter they attend four meetings per year. The calcium/vitamin D supplementation subtrial tests whether calcium and vitamin D supplements reduce the risk of hip and other fractures and colorectal cancer in postmenopausal women. Women in the hormone replacement therapy and the dietary modification trials are encouraged to join the calcium/vitamin D supplementation study. Approximately 45, 000 postmenopausal women are randomized into one of two study groups. One group was randomly assigned to receive 1, 000 mg of elemental calcium and 400 International Units of vitamin D₃daily. The second group received a matching placebo.

### Is it time to revisit the recommendations for initiation of menopausal hormone therapy? [^61c6d71c]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Findings from the Women's Health Initiative studies led to menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) guidelines generally recommending the initiation of MHT be limited to women within 10 years of their menopause or before the age of 60 years. This recommendation has led to women who experience troublesome menopausal symptoms and who have not commenced MHT within these limits often being denied this type of therapy. Similarly, the majority of women who might benefit from the protective effects of MHT against bone loss and fracture are not offered this treatment option if they do not fit with these criteria. Based on review of the evidence that led to the conditional initiation of MHT, and subsequent studies, we propose that the recommendations regarding the initiation of MHT need to change to be more inclusive of women outside these chronological limits.

### Hormone replacement therapy, cancer, controversies, and women's health: historical, epidemiological, biological, clinical, and advocacy perspectives [^91270ecf]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2005). Low credibility.

Routine acceptance of use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) was shattered in 2002 when results of the largest HRT randomised clinical trial, the women's health initiative, indicated that long term use of oestrogen plus progestin HRT not only was associated with increased risk of cancer but, contrary to expectations, did not decrease, and may have increased, risk of cardiovascular disease. In June 2004 a group of historians, epidemiologists, biologists, clinicians, and women's health advocates met to discuss the scientific and social context of and response to these findings. It was found that understanding the evolving and contending knowledge on hormones and health requires: (1) considering its societal context, including the impact of the pharmaceutical industry, the biomedical emphasis on individualised risk and preventive medicine, and the gendering of hormones; and (2) asking why, for four decades, since the mid-1960s, were millions of women prescribed powerful pharmacological agents already demonstrated, three decades earlier, to be carcinogenic? Answering this question requires engaging with core issues of accountability, complexity, fear of mortality, and the conduct of socially responsible science.

### A comparative review of the risks and benefits of hormone replacement therapy regimens [^48a3ccd3]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

The Women's Health Initiative (a large, randomized, placebo-controlled trial) investigated the effect of conjugated equine estrogens combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate on specific potential long-term benefits and risks. A review of the clinical studies that have investigated different types and regimens of estrogens combined with progestins was conducted to assess how applicable the results of the Women's Health Initiative are to hormone replacement therapy regimens in general. The studies that were reviewed were limited to randomized clinical trials and observational studies that have been published over the last 15 years (1987–2002) and to meta-analyses and reviews that may have included the literature before 1987. The increased risks for venous thromboembolism, stroke, coronary heart disease, and breast cancer that were identified in the Women's Health Initiative trial have also been reported with postmenopausal hormone therapies that contain a variety of estrogen and progestin products. The beneficial effects that were noted in the Women's Health Initiative, with respect to reductions in fractures and colorectal cancer, have not been evaluated in large, randomized controlled trials that use different estrogen/progestin combinations; however, observational trials that used a variety of estrogen or hormone replacement therapy products and randomized clinical studies that evaluated bone mineral density (an excellent predictor of fracture risk) with different estrogen/hormone replacement therapy regimens would suggest that results would be similar to those found in the Women's Health Initiative. Although the relief of menopausal symptoms, the primary reason women seek treatment, was not included in the overall benefit/risk analysis of the Women's Health Initiative, numerous trials suggest that all therapies are effective. Overall, these data indicate that the benefit/risk analysis that was reported in the Women's Health Initiative can be generalized to all postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy products.

### The women's health initiative trials of menopausal hormone therapy: lessons learned [^e8fd7f8e]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) assessed oral conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) taken with or without medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) for prevention of chronic disease in postmenopausal women aged 50–79 years.

Methods

Women with an intact uterus (n = 16,608) were randomized to CEE+ MPA therapy or placebo for a median of 5.6 years; women with hysterectomy (n = 10,739) were randomized to CEE-alone therapy or placebo for a median of 7.2 years. Both cohorts have been followed for 18 years.

Results

In the overall study population (mean age, 63 y), neither estrogen-progestin therapy (EPT) nor estrogen-only therapy prevented coronary heart disease or led to a favorable balance of chronic-disease benefits and risks. Subgroup analyses, however, suggest that timing of hormone therapy (HT) initiation influences the relation between HT and coronary risk, as well as its overall benefit-risk balance, with more favorable effects in women who are younger (age < 60 year) or recently menopausal (within 10 year) than in women who are older or further past the menopausal transition. In younger women who entered the trial of estrogen-only therapy with oophorectomy, the intervention was associated with a significant 32% reduction in all-cause mortality over long-term follow-up.

Conclusions

WHI findings indicate important differences in HT-related clinical outcomes by age and time since menopause. Systemic HT has an acceptable safety profile for menopause management when initiated among healthy women who are younger (or recently menopausal) and not at elevated risk for cardiovascular disease or breast cancer. Initiation of treatment in older women who are distant from menopause onset, however, should be avoided. Other HT formulations and routes of delivery warrant further study.(WHI clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00000611).

### A critique of the women's health initiative hormone therapy study [^61254b10]. Fertility and Sterility (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

This review critiques The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study, focusing on aspects of the study design contributing to the adverse events resulting in the study's discontinuation.

Conclusion(S)

Two aspects of the design contributed to the adverse events: [1] The decision to administer continuous combined conjugated equine estrogen (CEE)/medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) or E alone as a standard regimen to a population with little previous hormonal treatment, ranging in age from 50–79 years, who, because of their age, were predisposed to coronary and cerebral atherosclerosis. [2] Selection of an untested regimen of continuous combined CEE plus MPA, which we hypothesize, negated the protective effect of E on the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems. Multiple observational studies that preceded the WHI study concluded that the use of E alone and E plus cyclic (not daily) progestin combination treatments initiated in early menopause had beneficial effects. The therapeutic regimens resulted in prevention of atherosclerosis and reductions in coronary artery disease mortality. It is our conclusion that the WHI hormonal replacement study had major design flaws that led to adverse conclusions about the positive effects of hormone therapy. An alternative hormonal regimen is proposed that, on the basis of data supporting its beneficial cardiovascular effects, when initiated appropriately in a population of younger, more recently menopausal women, has promise to yield a more favorable risk/benefit outcome.

### The women's health initiative could not have detected cardioprotective effects of starting hormone therapy during the menopausal transition [^f8cc19d4]. Fertility and Sterility (2004). Low credibility.

The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized controlled trial failed to show cardioprotection by estrogen plus progestin treatment of postmenopausal women. But by design, the WHI population was 10-fold underpowered to show cardioprotection of women starting hormone treatment during the menopausal transition. Thus, observational studies that showed cardioprotection in such women remain the only applicable clinical guide to this issue. Randomized controlled trials are urgently needed to test cardioprotection in women starting treatment during the menopausal transition.

### Lessons learned from the women's health initiative trials of menopausal hormone therapy [^1d34f431]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

We re-evaluate the Women's Health Initiative findings and their implications for clinical practice. Menopausal hormone therapy (HT) was effective for relief of vasomotor symptoms, and the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) tended to be reduced in women close to menopause compared with the increased risk in women more distant from menopause. In recently menopausal women, short-term absolute risks of stroke and venous thromboembolism were small. Estrogen plus progestin therapy, but not estrogen therapy, increased the risk of breast cancer with a suggestion of greater risk when initiated close to the menopause. Menopausal HT increased the risk of CHD in women more than 20 years distant from menopause, particularly in women with vasomotor symptoms. It remains unknown whether the suggestive benefit for CHD in younger women will translate into benefits or harms if menopausal HT is continued into older ages. Based on Women's Health Initiative data, the use of menopausal HT for fewer than 5 years is a reasonable option for the relief of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms. The risks seen with estrogen plus progestin therapy suggest careful periodic reassessment of the ongoing therapy needs for women taking estrogen plus progestin therapy. The more favorable profile of estrogen therapy allows for individualized management with respect to duration of use when symptoms persist. For both estrogen therapy and estrogen plus progestin therapy, the baseline risk profile of the individual woman needs to be taken into account. Menopausal HT is not suitable for long-term prevention of CHD given risks of stroke, venous thromboembolism, and breast cancer (for estrogen plus progestin therapy) found in both clinical trials and in observational studies.

### Effect of the women's health initiative on women's decisions to discontinue postmenopausal hormone therapy [^95008895]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine whether women who were using postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) before publication of Women's Health Initiative findings about risks associated with HT had been informed about the findings once published; and to estimate how knowledge of these findings was associated with their decision to discontinue HT.

Methods

We performed a telephone survey of 670 female members of a large health maintenance organization, aged 50–69 yr, who had regularly used HT from July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2002.

Results

Most women (93%) reported hearing about the new findings; however, only 57% considered the quality of this information to be good, regardless of its source: mass media (21%), the health plan (32%), or a health care practitioner (34%). Women's knowledge of Women's Health Initiative findings was generally poor; 64% did not know what the findings were, 7% were unsure of their knowledge, 6% had incorrect knowledge, and 23% had correct knowledge of Women's Health Initiative findings. On a simple, five-question, true-or-false quiz about HT risks, 30% of respondents answered four to five questions correctly. Although not well informed, 56% reported attempting to discontinue HT in the 6 to 8 months after July 2002. Our multivariable model included five statistically significant predictors of attempting to stop HT: having been sent a letter about Women's Health Initiative findings (odds ratio [OR] 2.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8, 3.9), reporting good-quality information from media (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.3, 3.3), having started HT for health promotion (OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.2, 3.3), using a lower-than-standard dosage of estrogen (OR 1.9; 95% CI 1.1, 3.1), and correctly answering four or more items on the HT quiz (OR 1.9; 95% CI 1.2, 2.8).

Conclusion

During the 6–8 months after publication of Women's Health Initiative trial findings, most regular postmenopausal HT users tried to stop using HT, despite not being well informed about the Women's Health Initiative findings.

### Menopausal hormone therapy influence on breast cancer outcomes in the women's health initiative [^54b6afc7]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2015). Low credibility.

The Woman's Health Initiative has conducted 2 full-scale, placebo-controlled clinical trials to determine the influence of menopausal therapy on breast cancer incidence and outcome. Estrogen plus progestin use in postmenopausal women with a uterus increases breast cancer incidence and deaths from breast cancer. Despite a short-term reduction in risk after stopping estrogen plus progestin use, an increase in breast cancer risk persists postintervention. Estrogen-alone use in postmenopausal women with prior hysterectomy reduces breast cancer incidence and reduces deaths from breast cancer. The reduced breast cancer risk persists for several years after stopping estrogen-alone use but is lost in late postintervention. These findings suggest recalibration of breast cancer risk and benefit consideration for both regimens, with estrogen plus progestin use associated with greater risk and estrogen-alone use associated with greater benefit. Use of either regimen in clinical practice requires careful consideration of all clinical risks and benefits.

### The women's health initiative randomized trials of menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer: findings in context [^9218afd6]. Menopause (2023). Medium credibility.

Importance and Objective

The menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) association with breast cancer has been controversial for more than 40 years. Most recently, findings from cohort studies have been discordant compared with those from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized trials. In cohort studies, both estrogen therapy and estrogen plus progestin were associated with higher breast cancer incidence. In contrast, in the WHI randomized trials, findings for estrogen plus progestin are concordant with cohort study reports, whereas estrogen therapy significantly reduced breast cancer incidence. In addition, concerns have been raised regarding the WHI findings from both trials. In this report, we briefly summarize findings for MHT on breast cancer from cohort studies and the WHI randomized trials. The report focus is addressing, point-by-point, concerns raised regarding the WHI findings.

Methods

For cohort studies, we relied on the latest findings from (1) the meta-analysis of the Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer and (2) the Million Women's Study. To identify commentaries and editorials, "Menopause" and "Climacteric" were searched from 2002 to present; PubMed and Google Scholar were searched for commentaries, editorials, and breast cancer, MHT, estrogen, conjugated equine estrogen, estradiol, "hormone replacement therapy", and "HRT".

Discussion and Conclusions

Thirty commentaries challenging WHI findings were identified. All were reviewed, and issues needing response were identified. Findings from the meta-analysis from the Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer and the Million Women Study were summarized and compared with finding in the two WHI randomized trials evaluating estrogen therapy and estrogen plus progestin. Based on the randomized clinical trials, estrogen therapy, for women with prior hysterectomy, decreases breast cancer incidence and mortality. In contrast, estrogen plus progestin increases breast cancer incidence, which persists through two decades. Women considering estrogen plus progestin use for vasomotor symptoms should understand the breast cancer risk.

### Coronary heart disease and menopause management: the swinging pendulum of HRT [^c44fd190]. Atherosclerosis (2009). Low credibility.

The Women's Health Initiative comprised a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of therapeutic and dietary interventions influencing postmenopausal women's health. One arm evaluated hormone replacement therapy and its effects on major health outcomes. Initial publication of the preliminary results suggested overall harm from hormone replacement therapy, leading to a dramatic worldwide decrease in its use, and concerns from clinicians and regulatory authorities. Subsequent publications with more detailed analyses appear to have countermanded these initial concerns. Analyses of the studies have not been adherent to those specified in the original published protocol. Nominal confidence intervals should have been used only for the primary outcome, which was coronary heart disease. Initially reported as showing a significant increase in events with hormone replacement therapy, in a subsequent analysis of the full data the increase was no longer significant. Adjusted confidence intervals showed no significant increase for breast cancer, the primary adverse outcome. A major difference in the effects of hormones between younger and older women has emerged but this important finding has been minimized. For women under age 60 years or within 10 years of menopause, the final findings for all outcomes closely resemble those from observational cohorts. The raw data must be made available for independent assessment to obtain valid conclusions which may again change clinical practice.

### Where are we 10 years after the women's health initiative? [^ac03bd67]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

The media attention surrounding the publication of the initial results of WHI in 2002 led to fear and confusion regarding the use of hormonal therapy (HT) after menopause. This led to a dramatic reduction in prescriptions for HT in the United States and around the world. Although in 2002 it was stated that the results pertained to all women receiving HT, subsequent studies from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and others clearly showed that younger women and those close to menopause had a very beneficial risk-to-benefit ratio. Indeed, the results showed similar protective effects for coronary disease and a reduction in mortality that had been shown in earlier observational studies, which had also focused on younger symptomatic women. In younger women, the increased number of cases of venous thrombosis and ischemic stroke was low, rendering them "rare" events using World Health Organization nomenclature. Breast cancer rates were also low and were found to be decreased with estrogen alone. In women receiving estrogen and progestogen for the first time in the WHI, breast cancer rates did not increase significantly for 7 years. Other data suggest that other regimens and the use of other progestogens may also be safer. It has been argued that in the 10 years since WHI, many women have been denied HT, including those with severe symptoms, and that this has significantly disadvantaged a generation of women. Some reports have also suggested an increased rate of osteoporotic fractures since the WHI. Therefore, the question is posed as to whether we have now come full circle in our understanding of the use of HT in younger women. Although it is appropriate to treat women with symptoms at the onset of menopause, because there is no proven therapy for primary prevention, in some women the use of HT for this role may at least be entertained.

### Hormone use and patient concerns after the findings of the women's health initiative [^37162bac]. Menopause (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess behaviors and concerns related to hormone therapy after the findings of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI).

Design

A survey was mailed to a random sample of 1,200 women identified through the pharmacy database as taking one of two estrogen + progestogen therapies (EPT) during the 6-month period before the publication of WHI findings. Questions included hormone use history, changes in usage, an assessment of symptoms, symptom changes, health behavior changes, use of alternative therapies, and demographics.

Results

The response rate was 70%, with women in their 60s and those receiving hormone therapy for 5 or more years were more likely to respond (P < 0.05). The majority had started hormones for symptom relief (69%) and expected to continue use. Many reported discontinuation (63%) or modifying their medication (18%). Half of these women stopped then restarted, the other half changed products. Women in their 50s were more likely to remain on hormones than older women (P < 0.01), and those taking ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone acetate were more likely to remain on their medication than those on conjugated estrogens (43% vs 29%, P < 0.01). Little change was reported in exercise and 19% increased their calcium intake. Patient concerns fell into five major categories: long-term effects, symptom control, breast cancer risk, bone health, and cognitive function.

Conclusions

Women seem to be heeding the warnings about hormones but remain concerned about the potential long-term sequelae and symptom control. More research is needed to identify safer approaches to symptom relief and to address the concerns expressed.

### Menopausal hormone therapy and chronic disease risk in the women's health initiative: is timing everything? [^717770d0]. Endocrine Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

This review provides a comprehensive overview of the most recent findings from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) hormone therapy (HT) trials and highlights the role of age and other clinical risk factors in risk stratification.

Methods

We review the findings on cardiovascular disease, cancer outcomes, all-cause mortality, and other major endpoints in the two WHI HT trials (conjugated equine estrogens [CEEs, 0.625 mg/day] with or without medroxyprogesterone acetate [MPA, 2.5 mg/day]).

Results

The hazard ratio (HR) for coronary heart disease (CHD) was 1.18 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.95 to 1.45) in the CEE+MPA trial and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.78 to 1.14) in the CEE-alone trial. In both HT trials, there was an increased risk of stroke and deep vein thrombosis and a lower risk of hip fractures and diabetes. The HT regimens had divergent effects on breast cancer. CEE+MPA increased breast cancer risk (cumulative HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.48), whereas CEE alone had a protective effect (cumulative HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.97). The absolute risks of HT were low in younger women (ages 50 to 59 years) and those who were within 10 years of menopause onset. Furthermore, for CHD, the risks were elevated for women with metabolic syndrome or high low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations but not in women without these risk factors. Factor V Leiden genotype was associated with elevated risk of venous thromboembolism on HT.

Conclusion

HT has a complex pattern of benefits and risks. Women in early menopause have low absolute risks of chronic disease outcomes on HT. Use of HT for management of menopausal symptoms remains appropriate, and risk stratification will help to identify women in whom benefits would be expected to outweigh risks.

### The randomized world is not without its imperfections: reflections on the women's health initiative study [^ecf72665]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

In May 2002, the Women's Heath Initiative (WHI) clinical trial, designed to clarify the risks and benefits of combination hormone replacement therapy, came to a premature halt. An interim safety review after an average follow-up of 5.2 years found that a combination of estrogen and progestin often prescribed to postmenopausal women increased the risk of invasive breast cancer, heart disease, stroke, and pulmonary embolism. The combination hormone therapy reduced bone fractures and colorectal cancer, but not enough to outweigh the other risks. The WHI trial presents a challenge for patients, physicians, and epidemiologists, since many observational studies have shown cardiovascular benefits of long-term hormone replacement therapy (HRT). At the same time, a companion paper in the same journal reported an epidemiologic study with a 13.4-year mean follow-up suggesting that estrogen replacement therapy, when used alone for 10 years or more, increases the risk of ovarian cancer. The medical community is still recovering from these twin shocks and trying to digest the results of both of these studies. The WHI study calls into question the long-term use of HRT in healthy women. The benefit of the temporary use of estrogen in controlling disruptive symptoms of the menopause is not being contested. Absent from many news releases are the hedging and equivocation typical of other reported clinical trials. There are still some "hanging chads" out there, and this commentary is designed to examine the uncertainties that remain after the WHI report. It is also intended to suggest development of alternative strategies to control symptoms of the menopausal transition that will reduce risks of HRT. The evidence from the WHI study will need to be incorporated into medical decision making, but clinical decisions, like most human decisions, are complex and in the final analysis must be based on information from many sources.

### Menopausal hormone therapy trends before versus after 2002: impact of the women's health initiative study results [^42a3fd14]. Menopause (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To better understand how to educate patients and providers about study findings relevant to treatment guidelines, we assessed pre- versus post-Women's Health Initiative (WHI) differences in menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) initiation and continuation and their correlates, and in women's reasons for initiation and discontinuation.

Methods

We analyzed survey data from up to 14 approximately annual visits over 17 years (1996–2013) from 3,018 participants in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation, a prospective cohort study. We used logistic regression to compare pre- versus post-WHI associations of covariates with MHT initiation and continuation, and to compare pre- versus post-WHI reasons for initiation and continuation.

Results

MHT initiation dropped from 8.6% pre-WHI to 2.8% post-WHI (P < 0.0001), and the corresponding decrease in MHT continuation was 84.0% to 62.0% (P < 0.0001). Decreases in MHT initiation and continuation occurred across a range of participant subgroups, consistent with wide dissemination of post-WHI recommendations. However, contrary to current guidelines, we found large declines in MHT use in subgroups for whom MHT is often recommended, that is, younger women and those with more vasomotor symptoms. Post-WHI, women's reasons for MHT initiation and discontinuation reflected concerns highlighted by WHI results. The largest declines in initiation reasons were for reducing risks of osteoporosis and heart disease, whereas the largest increases in discontinuation reasons were for media reports and provider advice.

Conclusions

Immediate post-WHI recommendations for MHT use were widely adopted. MHT risks documented in older women, however, may have led younger symptomatic women to forgo MHT for symptom relief.

### Hormone therapy and physical function change among older women in the women's health initiative: a randomized controlled trial [^77d390d5]. Menopause (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Although estrogen may be linked to biological pathways that maintain higher physical function, the evidence is derived mostly from observational epidemiology and therefore has numerous limitations. We examined whether hormone therapy affected physical function in women 65 to 79 years of age at enrollment.

Methods

This study involves an analysis of the Women's Health Initiative randomized controlled trials of hormone therapy in which 922 nondisabled women who had previous hysterectomies were randomized to receive estrogen therapy or a placebo and 1,458 nondisabled women with intact uteri were randomized to receive estrogen + progestin therapy or a placebo. Changes in physical function were analyzed for treatment effect, and subgroup differences were evaluated. All women completed performance-based measures of physical function (grip strength, chair stands, and timed walk) at baseline. These measures were repeated after 1, 3, and 6 years.

Results

Overall, participants' grip strength declined by 12.0%, chair stands declined by 3.5%, and walk pace slowed by 11.4% in the 6 years of follow-up (all P values < 0.0001). Hormone therapy, as compared with placebo, was not associated with an increased or decreased risk of decline in physical function in either the intention-to-treat analyses or in analyses restricted to participants who were compliant in taking study pills.

Conclusions

Hormone therapy provided no overall protection against functional decline in nondisabled postmenopausal women 65 years or older in 6 years of follow-up. This study did not address the influence of hormone therapy for women of younger ages.

### Use of hormone replacement therapy, 1998–2007: sustained impact of the women's health initiative findings [^57e3ae07]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Trials of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for prevention of chronic disease in postmenopausal women have suggested that the risks of treatment outweigh the benefits. The publication in 2002 of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study sparked a rapid decline in HRT purchases among American women.

Objective

To examine the impact of the WHI findings on patterns of HRT use in Israeli women.

Methods

We linked purchases of estrogen preparations from 1998 to 2007 by female Israeli health maintenance organization members aged 45 years and older to membership data. For each year, we calculated total annual purchases and rate of HRT utilization, characterized new users by age and mode of therapy, and examined rates of switching between modes of therapy.

Results

Twenty percent of women aged 45 years and older purchased estrogen products in 2001, versus 10% in 2007 (p < 0.001; χ²). Vaginally administered products accounted for a rising percentage of purchases, from 5% in 1999 to 18% in 2007. An increasing percentage of new users aged 55 years and older started with a vaginal product (62% in 1999, 82% in 2007). After 2002, new users of oral therapy discontinued use more quickly than those who started oral therapy before 2002. Tibolone accounted for an increasing percentage of oral drugs purchased (12% in 2003, 29% in 2007).

Conclusions

The WHI findings had a rapid and sustained impact on HRT utilization in a large population of Israeli women, including a sharp decrease in the rate of use, particularly of oral preparations, as well as reduced duration of therapy and increased use of vaginal preparations and tibolone as first choices for treatment.

### Hormone therapy for the prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women: recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^12f8d401]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

This statement summarizes the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations on hormone therapy for the prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women and the supporting scientific evidence, and updates the Task Force's 2002 recommendations on hormone replacement therapy. The updated statement is based on the results of the Women's Health Initiative randomized, controlled trial, as well as the information in the 2002 summary of the evidence on this topic, which is available on the USPSTF Web site (http://www.preventiveservices.ahrq.gov).

### Update in hormone therapy use in menopause [^ccd90697]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

The original report from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) changed our understanding of the benefits and risks of hormone therapy. Since that time, reanalysis of the WHI and additional data from other studies have further refined these concepts. Here we provide an update on recent advances in the field. Menopausal hormone therapy continues to have a clinical role in the management of vasomotor symptoms. However, our understanding of the role of hormones in cardiovascular disease and breast cancer continues to evolve. Further analyses of the effect of age and proximity to menopause at the time of initiation of therapy, duration of treatment, dose, route of administration, and the persistence of risks and benefits after stopping hormone therapy are described. In addition, recent data have emerged suggesting that there may be a link between hormone therapy and cancers of the lung and ovary. Finally, we discuss new advances in hormone therapy that will likely lead to a more favorable benefit-to-risk ratio, enabling safer effective menopausal symptom relief.

### A decade after the women's health initiative – the experts do agree [^4da04cac]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Conclusion — indication for hormone therapy — states that leading medical societies devoted to the care of menopausal women agree that the decision to initiate hormone therapy should be for the indication of treatment of menopause-related symptoms, and although research is ongoing and these recommendations may be modified over time, there is no question that hormone therapy has an important role in managing symptoms for women during the menopausal transition and in early menopause.

---

### A decade after the women's health initiative – the experts do agree [^222592d1]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Hormone therapy duration — dose and time — emphasizes that the lowest dose of hormone therapy should be used for the shortest amount of time to manage menopausal symptoms; although fewer than 5 years is recommended for estrogen with progestogen therapy, duration should be individualized; for estrogen therapy alone, more flexibility in duration of therapy may be possible, but there are reports of increased risk of breast cancer after 10 to 15 years of use in large observational studies with estrogen alone.

---

### A decade after the women's health initiative – the experts do agree [^22394a4a]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer — associations with hormone therapy — reports that an increased risk of breast cancer is seen with 5 years or more of continuous estrogen with progestogen therapy, possibly earlier with continuous use since menopause; the risk is real but not great, and the risk decreases after hormone therapy is discontinued, while use of estrogen alone for a mean of 7 years in the Women's Health Initiative did not increase the risk of breast cancer.

### No increase in fractures after stopping hormone therapy: results from the women's health initiative [^5916f61a]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Context

The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) hormone therapy (HT) trials showed protection against hip and total fractures, but a later observational report suggested loss of benefit and a rebound increased risk after cessation of HT.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to examine fractures after discontinuation of HT.

Design and Setting

Two placebo-controlled randomized trials served as the study setting.

Patients

Study patients included WHI participants (N = 15,187) who continued active HT or placebo through the intervention period and who did not take HT in the postintervention period.

Interventions

Trial interventions included conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) in naturally menopausal women and CEE alone in women with prior hysterectomy.

Main Outcome Measures

Total fractures and hip fractures through 5 years after discontinuation of HT were recorded.

Results

Hip fractures were infrequent (∼2.5 per 1000 person-years); this finding was similar between trials and in former HT and placebo groups. There was no difference in total fractures in the CEE + MPA trial for former HT vs former placebo users (28.9 per 1000 person-years and 29.9 per 1000 person-years, respectively; hazard ratio [HR], 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87 to 1.09; P = 0.63); however, in the CEE-alone trial, total fractures were higher in former placebo users (36.9 per 1000 person-years) compared with the former active group (31.1 per 1000 person-years), a finding that was suggestive of a residual benefit of CEE against total fractures (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.73 to 0.98; P = 0.03).

Conclusions

We found no evidence for increased fracture risk, either sustained or transient, for former HT users compared with former placebo users after stopping HT. There was residual benefit for total fractures in former HT users from the CEE-alone study.

### Women's awareness and knowledge of hormone therapy post-women's health initiative [^8e90959d]. Menopause (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Findings from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) failed to confirm previous expectations about the net benefits of menopausal hormone therapy and have resulted in reduced use of these medications. The aim of this study was to evaluate women's awareness and knowledge concerning the risks and benefits of hormone therapy.

Design

A nationally representative survey was completed for a sample of 781 women (ages 40–60 y, mean 49 y) drawn from the Knowledge Networks Internet panel 24 months after publication of the first WHI findings, in June 2004. Responses were weighted to reflect the demographics of the US population. The main outcome measures were awareness of WHI and knowledge of its findings. An aggregate score was constructed to assess women's knowledge of the impact of hormone therapy on seven key disease outcomes. Logistic regression determined the independent predictors of (1) WHI awareness and (2) a positive aggregate knowledge score, reflecting appropriate responses about risks and benefits.

Results

Only 29% of women were aware of the WHI results. Only 40% of women had a positive aggregate knowledge score. Aside from awareness of WHI and independent of other factors, knowledge scores were lower for African American women (odds ratio, 0.4; 95% CI: 0.2–0.6) and among women with less education (odds ratio, 0.5; 95% CI: 0.3–0.9). Knowledge was greatest for breast cancer and osteoporosis outcomes and most limited for colorectal cancer and memory loss.

Conclusion

Surveyed women had limited awareness and knowledge of the WHI results, suggesting limited diffusion. Targeting younger, less educated, and African American women is warranted.

### Hormone therapy: evolving concepts [^cb1995d3]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the medical literature published in 2002 regarding menopausal hormone therapy and its impact on clinical practice.

Methods

A literature search was performed using MEDLINE with the keywords of menopause, sex steroids, and hormone replacement therapy. Randomized clinical trials were reviewed. An evidence-based review is presented.

Results

Menopausal hormone therapy has undergone radical change since the publication of the Women's Health Initiative randomized prospective trial of combined estrogen plus progestin therapy for disease prevention. After a mean of 5.2 years of follow-up, the E + P versus placebo trial of 16,608 women was stopped because the health risks of taking E + P exceeded the benefits. An increase in breast cancer risk, coupled with an adverse trend in overall risk-benefit ratio, reached the preset stopping boundaries. In addition, there was an increased risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and pulmonary embolism. The decreased risks seen for osteoporotic fracture and colorectal cancer were outweighed by the above risks. The FDA has required mandatory label changes for all hormone products based on these findings. The Women's Health Initiative found that treatment with estrogen plus progestin for up to 5 years is not beneficial overall. There is early harm for coronary heart disease, continuing harm for stroke and venous thromboembolism, and increasing harm for breast cancer. This risk-benefit profile is not consistent with a viable intervention for primary prevention of chronic diseases in postmenopausal women. Menopausal hormone therapy should be reserved for women with moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms.

Conclusions

In the past 20 years, menopause has become a household word, with much better understanding of its consequences. The growing numbers of menopausal women and clinical trials have coincided to draw increasing attention to the perimenopausal and menopausal years. Better studies of older therapies and the expanded number of new choices today, with more in development and evaluation, have complicated provider and patient choices but greatly improved the potential for effective intervention.

### Menopausal hormone therapy and health outcomes during the intervention and extended poststopping phases of the women's health initiative randomized trials [^55f02963]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Menopausal hormone therapy continues in clinical use but questions remain regarding its risks and benefits for chronic disease prevention.

Objective

To report a comprehensive, integrated overview of findings from the 2 Women's Health Initiative (WHI) hormone therapy trials with extended postintervention follow-up.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A total of 27,347 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years were enrolled at 40 US centers.

Interventions

Women with an intact uterus received conjugated equine estrogens (CEE; 0.625 mg/d) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA; 2.5 mg/d) (n = 8506) or placebo (n = 8102). Women with prior hysterectomy received CEE alone (0.625 mg/d) (n = 5310) or placebo (n = 5429). The intervention lasted a median of 5.6 years in CEE plus MPA trial and 7.2 years in CEE alone trial with 13 years of cumulative follow-up until September 30, 2010.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary efficacy and safety outcomes were coronary heart disease (CHD) and invasive breast cancer, respectively. A global index also included stroke, pulmonary embolism, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, hip fracture, and death.

Results

During the CEE plus MPA intervention phase, the numbers of CHD cases were 196 for CEE plus MPA vs 159 for placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 1.18; 95% CI, 0.95–1.45) and 206 vs 155, respectively, for invasive breast cancer (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.01–1.53). Other risks included increased stroke, pulmonary embolism, dementia (in women aged ≥ 65 years), gallbladder disease, and urinary incontinence; benefits included decreased hip fractures, diabetes, and vasomotor symptoms. Most risks and benefits dissipated postintervention, although some elevation in breast cancer risk persisted during cumulative follow-up (434 cases for CEE plus MPA vs 323 for placebo; HR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.11–1.48]). The risks and benefits were more balanced during the CEE alone intervention with 204 CHD cases for CEE alone vs 222 cases for placebo (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.78–1.14) and 104 vs 135, respectively, for invasive breast cancer (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.61–1.02); cumulatively, there were 168 vs 216, respectively, cases of breast cancer diagnosed (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65–0.97). Results for other outcomes were similar to CEE plus MPA. Neither regimen affected all-cause mortality. For CEE alone, younger women (aged 50–59 years) had more favorable results for all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and the global index (nominal P < .05 for trend by age). Absolute risks of adverse events (measured by the global index) per 10,000 women annually taking CEE plus MPA ranged from 12 excess cases for ages of 50–59 years to 38 for ages of 70–79 years; for women taking CEE alone, from 19 fewer cases for ages of 50–59 years to 51 excess cases for ages of 70–79 years. Quality-of-life outcomes had mixed results in both trials.

Conclusions and Relevance

Menopausal hormone therapy has a complex pattern of risks and benefits. Findings from the intervention and extended postintervention follow-up of the 2 WHI hormone therapy trials do not support use of this therapy for chronic disease prevention, although it is appropriate for symptom management in some women.

### Esterified estrogens (Menest) [^f2ae2791]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Women's Health Initiative Memory Study

The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), a substudy of WHI, enrolled 4,532 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older (47% were age 65 to 69 years, 35% were 70 to 74 years, and 18% were 75 years of age and older) to evaluate the effects of CE/MPA (0.625 mg conjugated estrogens plus 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate) on the incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) compared with placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the estrogen/progestin group (45 per 10,000 women-years) and 21 in the placebo group (22 per 10,000 women-years) were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia in the hormone therapy group was 2.05 (95% CI, 1.21 to 3.48) compared to placebo. Differences between groups became apparent in the first year of treatment. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women. (See Boxed Warning and WARNINGS, Dementia .)

### Indications for hormone therapy: the post-women's health initiative era [^a47f81d5]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Information from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trial has given physicians valuable tools for counseling women aged 50 to 79 years about the short-term risks of hormone therapy (HT). Unanswered questions remain, particularly on the risks and benefits of discontinuing HT among long-term users. The decision to discontinue HT should be carefully considered, because stopping and re-starting after several months may "reset the clock" for risks associated with changes in hepatic protein synthesis. The current authors recommend low-dose transdermal hormonal formulations, but no large-scale randomized trials exist to confirm the veracity of this recommendation. It has been suggested that starting HT in the menopausal transition would alleviate the HT risks observed withWHI. Until additional data are available to counsel women in the menopausal transition, however, the conservative counseling approach is to apply those figures available from the WHI, particularly because women aged 50 to 59 years using estrogen-progestin therapy have an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio, similar to that seen in older women.

### Breast cancer risk in relation to the interval between menopause and starting hormone therapy [^4a209c46]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2011). Low credibility.

The substantial heterogeneity in hormonal therapy–associated risks of breast cancer that we found, with independent effects of the type of hormonal therapy used, the interval between menopause and starting hormonal therapy, and the duration of hormonal therapy use could well account for much of the apparent variation in hormonal therapy–associated risks across studies. The populations that have been studied vary in terms of the prevalence of obesity and the interval between menopause and starting hormonal therapy. For example, in the Women's Health Initiative randomized trials, some 80% of participants were overweight or obese and approximately 90% were randomly assigned to hormonal therapy 5 years or more after their menopause. Among users of estrogen-only hormonal therapy, we found little or no increase in the risk of breast cancer among overweight or obese women who started hormonal therapy 5 years or more after menopause (RR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.73 to 1.14), consistent with findings from the Women's Health Initiative trial (RR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.59 to 1.01). The corresponding value for users of estrogen–progestin hormonal therapy in our data (RR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.18 to 1.64) was also consistent with findings from the Women's Health Initiative trial (RR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.00 to 1.59). Moreover, breast cancer incidence rates in the estrogen–progestin randomized trial were similar to those observed here (0.46% per year in this study for use beginning 5 years or more after menopause and 0.43% per year in the randomized trial vs 0.3% per year in nonusers of hormone therapy both in this study and in the trial). However, breast cancer incidence rates in this study were highest among current users of estrogen–progestogen who began use less than 5 years after menopause (0.61% per year), and no comparable randomized data are available because the large majority of women were randomly assigned to estrogen–progestin more than 5 years after their menopause. Hence, the findings from randomized trials of hormonal therapy with respect to breast cancer risk may not apply to women who start using hormonal therapy at around the time of their menopause.

### Economic return from the women's health initiative estrogen plus progestin clinical trial: a modeling study [^b0d3ed29]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The findings of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) estrogen plus progestin (E+P) trial led to a substantial reduction in use of combined hormone therapy (cHT) among postmenopausal women in the United States. The economic effect of this shift has not been evaluated relative to the trial's $260 million cost (2012 U.S. dollars).

Objective

To estimate the economic return from the WHI E+P trial.

Design

Decision model to simulate health outcomes for a "WHI scenario" with observed cHT use and a "no-WHI scenario" with cHT use extrapolated from the pretrial period.

Data Sources

Primary analyses of WHI outcomes, peer-reviewed literature, and government sources.

Target Population

Postmenopausal women in the United States, aged 50 to 79 years, who did not have a hysterectomy.

Time Horizon

2003 to 2012.

Perspective

Payer.

Intervention

Combined hormone therapy.

Outcome Measures

Disease incidence, expenditure, quality-adjusted life-years, and net economic return.

Results Of Base-Case Analysis

The WHI scenario resulted in 4.3 million fewer cHT users, 126,000 fewer breast cancer cases, 76,000 fewer cardiovascular disease cases, 263,000 more fractures, 145,000 more quality-adjusted life-years, and expenditure savings of $35.2 billion. The corresponding net economic return of the trial was $37.1 billion ($140 per dollar invested in the trial) at a willingness-to-pay level of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year.

Results Of Sensitivity Analysis

The 95% CI for the net economic return of the trial was $23.1 to $51.2 billion.

Limitation

No evaluation of indirect costs or outcomes beyond 2012.

Conclusion

The WHI E+P trial made high-value use of public funds with a substantial return on investment. These results can contribute to discussions about the role of public funding for large, prospective trials with high potential for public health effects.

Primary Funding Source

National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.

### Association of menopausal hormone therapy with breast cancer incidence and mortality during long-term follow-up of the women's health initiative randomized clinical trials [^4d402514]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The influence of menopausal hormone therapy on breast cancer remains unsettled with discordant findings from observational studies and randomized clinical trials.

Objective

To assess the association of prior randomized use of estrogen plus progestin or prior randomized use of estrogen alone with breast cancer incidence and mortality in the Women's Health Initiative clinical trials.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Long-term follow-up of 2 placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials that involved 27 347 postmenopausal women aged 50 through 79 years with no prior breast cancer and negative baseline screening mammogram. Women were enrolled at 40 US centers from 1993 to 1998 with follow-up through December 31, 2017.

Interventions

In the trial involving 16 608 women with a uterus, 8506 were randomized to receive 0.625 mg/d of conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) plus 2.5 mg/d of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and 8102, placebo. In the trial involving 10 739 women with prior hysterectomy, 5310 were randomized to receive 0.625 mg/d of CEE alone and 5429, placebo. The CEE-plus-MPA trial was stopped in 2002 after 5.6 years' median intervention duration, and the CEE-only trial was stopped in 2004 after 7.2 years' median intervention duration.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was breast cancer incidence (protocol prespecified primary monitoring outcome for harm) and secondary outcomes were deaths from breast cancer and deaths after breast cancer.

Results

Among 27 347 postmenopausal women who were randomized in both trials (baseline mean [SD] age, 63.4 years [7.2 years]), after more than 20 years of median cumulative follow-up, mortality information was available for more than 98%. CEE alone compared with placebo among 10 739 women with a prior hysterectomy was associated with statistically significantly lower breast cancer incidence with 238 cases (annualized rate, 0.30%) vs 296 cases (annualized rate, 0.37%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65–0.93; P = 0.005) and was associated with statistically significantly lower breast cancer mortality with 30 deaths (annualized mortality rate, 0.031%) vs 46 deaths (annualized mortality rate, 0.046%; HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.37–0.97; P = 0.04). In contrast, CEE plus MPA compared with placebo among 16 608 women with a uterus was associated with statistically significantly higher breast cancer incidence with 584 cases (annualized rate, 0.45%) vs 447 cases (annualized rate, 0.36%; HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.13–1.45; P < .001) and no significant difference in breast cancer mortality with 71 deaths (annualized mortality rate, 0.045%) vs 53 deaths (annualized mortality rate, 0.035%; HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 0.94–1.95; P = 0.11).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this long-term follow-up study of 2 randomized trials, prior randomized use of CEE alone, compared with placebo, among women who had a previous hysterectomy, was significantly associated with lower breast cancer incidence and lower breast cancer mortality, whereas prior randomized use of CEE plus MPA, compared with placebo, among women who had an intact uterus, was significantly associated with a higher breast cancer incidence but no significant difference in breast cancer mortality.

### Current recommendations: what is the clinician to do? [^0bf98c1b]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Low credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy (HT) has complex biologic effects but continues to have an important clinical role in the management of vasomotor and other menopausal symptoms. The rational use of menopausal HT requires balancing the potential benefits and risks of treatment. Findings from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and other randomized clinical trials have helped to clarify the benefits and risks of HT and have provided insights to improve decision making. Several clinical characteristics have utility in identifying women for whom benefits of HT are likely to outweigh the risks. Age and time since menopause are strong predictors of health outcomes and absolute risks associated with HT, and differences by age have been particularly apparent for estrogen alone. In the WHI trial of conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) alone, younger women (50–59 years) had more favorable results for all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and the global index, but not for stroke and venous thrombosis. Age trends were less clear for CEE + medroxyprogesterone acetate, owing to increased risks of breast cancer, stroke, and venous thrombosis in all age groups. Absolute risks of adverse events were lower in younger than in older women in both trials, however. Other predictors of lower vascular risk from HT include favorable lipid status and absence of the metabolic syndrome. Transdermal administration may be associated with lower risks of venous thrombosis and stroke, but additional research is needed. The use of risk stratification and personalized risk assessment offers promise for improved benefit-risk profile and safety of HT. One approach to decision making is presented. Key elements include: assessment of whether the patient has moderate to severe menopausal symptoms, the primary indication for initiating systemic HT (vaginal estrogen may be used to treat genitourinary symptoms in the absence of vasomotor symptoms); understanding the patient's own preference regarding therapy; evaluating the patient for the presence of any contraindications to HT, as well as the time since menopause onset and baseline risks of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer; reviewing carefully the benefits and risks of treatment with the patient, giving more emphasis to absolute than to relative measures of effect; and, if HT is initiated, regularly reviewing the patient's need for continued treatment.

### Estradiol valerate (Delestrogen) [^a3ca7efd]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Women's Health Initiative Memory Study

The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), a substudy of WHI, enrolled 4,532 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older (47% were age 65 to 69 years, 35% were 70 to 74 years, and 18% were 75 years of age and older) to evaluate the effects of CE/MPA (0.625 mg conjugated estrogens plus 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate) on the incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) compared with placebo.

After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the estrogen/progestin group (45 per 10,000 women-years) and 21 in the placebo group (22 per 10,000 women-years) were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia in the hormone therapy group was 2.05 (95% CI, 1.21 to 3.48) compared to placebo. Differences between groups became apparent in the first year of treatment. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women [see BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS, Dementia].

### Hormone-replacement therapy: current thinking [^15f6ac08]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2017). Medium credibility.

For several decades, the role of hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) has been debated. Early observational data on HRT showed many benefits, including a reduction in coronary heart disease (CHD) and mortality. More recently, randomized trials, including the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), studying mostly women many years after the the onset of menopause, showed no such benefit and, indeed, an increased risk of CHD and breast cancer, which led to an abrupt decrease in the use of HRT. Subsequent reanalyzes of data from the WHI with age stratification, newer randomized and observational data and several meta-analyses now consistently show reductions in CHD and mortality when HRT is initiated soon after menopause. HRT also significantly decreases the incidence of various symptoms of menopause and the risk of osteoporotic fractures, and improves quality of life. In younger healthy women (aged 50–60 years), the risk-benefit balance is positive for using HRT, with risks considered rare. As no validated primary prevention strategies are available for younger women (< 60 years of age), other than lifestyle management, some consideration might be given to HRT as a prevention strategy as treatment can reduce CHD and all-cause mortality. Although HRT should be primarily oestrogen-based, no particular HRT regimen can be advocated.

### The women's health initiative randomized trials and clinical practice: a review [^79b683f4]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Approximately 55 million people in the US and approximately 1.1 billion people worldwide are postmenopausal women. To inform clinical practice about the health effects of menopausal hormone therapy, calcium plus vitamin D supplementation, and a low-fat dietary pattern, the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) enrolled 161 808 postmenopausal US women (N = 68 132 in the clinical trials) aged 50 to 79 years at baseline from 1993 to 1998, and followed them up for up to 20 years.

Observations

The WHI clinical trial results do not support hormone therapy with oral conjugated equine estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone acetate for postmenopausal women or conjugated equine estrogens alone for those with prior hysterectomy to prevent cardiovascular disease, dementia, or other chronic diseases. However, hormone therapy is effective for treating moderate to severe vasomotor and other menopausal symptoms. These benefits of hormone therapy in early menopause, combined with lower rates of adverse effects of hormone therapy in early compared with later menopause, support initiation of hormone therapy before age 60 years for women without contraindications to hormone therapy who have bothersome menopausal symptoms. The WHI results do not support routinely recommending calcium plus vitamin D supplementation for fracture prevention in all postmenopausal women. However, calcium and vitamin D are appropriate for women who do not meet national guidelines for recommended intakes of these nutrients through diet. A low-fat dietary pattern with increased fruit, vegetable, and grain consumption did not prevent the primary outcomes of breast or colorectal cancer but was associated with lower rates of the secondary outcome of breast cancer mortality during long-term follow-up.

Conclusions and Relevance

For postmenopausal women, the WHI randomized clinical trials do not support menopausal hormone therapy to prevent cardiovascular disease or other chronic diseases. Menopausal hormone therapy is appropriate to treat bothersome vasomotor symptoms among women in early menopause, without contraindications, who are interested in taking hormone therapy. The WHI evidence does not support routine supplementation with calcium plus vitamin D for menopausal women to prevent fractures or a low-fat diet with increased fruits, vegetables, and grains to prevent breast or colorectal cancer. A potential role of a low-fat dietary pattern in reducing breast cancer mortality, a secondary outcome, warrants further study.

### Estrogen plus progestin and breast cancer incidence and mortality in the women's health initiative observational study [^4db4dd0e]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

Background

In the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized trial, estrogen plus progestin increased both breast cancer incidence and mortality. In contrast, most observational studies associate estrogen plus progestin with favorable prognosis breast cancers. To address differences, a cohort of WHI observational study participants with characteristics similar to the WHI clinical trial was studied.

Methods

We identified 41 449 postmenopausal women with no prior hysterectomy and mammogram negative within 2 years who were either not hormone users (n = 25 328) or estrogen and progestin users (n = 16 121). Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). All statistical tests were two-sided.

Results

After a mean of 11.3 (SD = 3.1) years, with 2236 breast cancers, incidence was higher in estrogen plus progestin users than in nonusers (0.60% vs 0.42%, annualized rate, respectively; HR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.41 to 1.70, P < .001). Women initiating hormone therapy closer to menopause had higher breast cancer risk with linear diminishing influence as time from menopause increased (P < .001). Survival after breast cancer, measured from diagnosis, was similar in combined hormone therapy users and nonusers (HR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.79 to 1.35). On a population basis, there were somewhat more deaths from breast cancer, measured from cohort entry (HR = 1.32, 95% CI = 0.90 to 1.93, P = 0.15), and more all-cause deaths after breast cancer (HR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.29 to 2.12, P < .001) in estrogen plus progestin users than in nonusers.

Conclusions

Consistent with WHI randomized trial findings, estrogen plus progestin use is associated with increased breast cancer incidence. Because prognosis after diagnosis on combined hormone therapy is similar to that of nonusers, increased breast cancer mortality can be expected.

### Timing and duration of menopausal hormone treatment may affect cardiovascular outcomes [^eb494931]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Largely on the basis of the first publication of findings of net harm with menopausal hormone treatment in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) hormone trials, current Food and Drug Administration recommendations limit menopausal hormone treatment to the "… shortest duration consistent with treatment goals… ", with goals generally taken to mean relief of menopausal symptoms and maximal duration as approximately 5 years. The WHI finding of net harm was due largely to the absence of beneficial effects on coronary heart disease incidence rates. Published analyses of WHI data by age or time since menopause find that excess coronary heart disease risk with menopausal hormone treatment is confined to more remotely menopausal or older women, with younger women showing nonsignificant trends toward benefit (the "timing hypothesis"). Moreover, a recently published reexamination of data from the WHI Estrogen plus Progestin trial suggests that reduced coronary heart disease risk may appear only after 5 to 6 years of treatment. Consistent with this finding, risk ratios for coronary heart disease were calculated as 1.08 (95% confidence interval, 0.86–1.36) in years 1 to 6 and as 0.46 (confidence interval, 0.28–0.78) in years 7 to 8+ in the WHI Estrogen Alone trial. Previous studies also support the beneficial effects of menopausal hormone treatment after prolonged exposure. Thus, current analyses do not support a generalized recommendation for short duration of menopausal hormone treatment. Rather, they suggest that current Food and Drug Administration practice guidelines should be reconsidered to allow individualized care based on risk:benefit considerations. New research is urgently needed evaluating influences of timing, duration, dose, route of administration, and agents on menopausal hormone treatment-related risks and benefits to better understand how to optimize recommendations for individual patients.

### Effects of estrogen plus progestin on health-related quality of life [^3bc9c947]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and other clinical trials indicate that significant health risks are associated with combination hormone use. Less is known about the effect of hormone therapy on health-related quality of life.

Methods

The WHI randomly assigned 16,608 postmenopausal women 50 to 79 years of age (mean, 63) with an intact uterus at base line to estrogen plus progestin (0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogen plus 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate, in 8506 women) or placebo (in 8102 women). Quality-of-life measures were collected at base line and at one year in all women and at three years in a subgroup of 1511 women.

Results

Randomization to estrogen plus progestin resulted in no significant effects on general health, vitality, mental health, depressive symptoms, or sexual satisfaction. The use of estrogen plus progestin was associated with a statistically significant but small and not clinically meaningful benefit in terms of sleep disturbance, physical functioning, and bodily pain after one year (the mean benefit in terms of sleep disturbance was 0.4 point on a 20-point scale, in terms of physical functioning 0.8 point on a 100-point scale, and in terms of pain 1.9 points on a 100-point scale). At three years, there were no significant benefits in terms of any quality-of-life outcomes. Among women 50 to 54 years of age with moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms at base line, estrogen and progestin improved vasomotor symptoms and resulted in a small benefit in terms of sleep disturbance but no benefit in terms of the other quality-of-life outcomes.

Conclusions

In this trial in postmenopausal women, estrogen plus progestin did not have a clinically meaningful effect on health-related quality of life.

### Estrogen therapy and breast cancer in randomized clinical trials: a narrative review [^ca5b10b1]. Menopause (2022). Medium credibility.

Importance and Objective

In the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized trial with 10,739 postmenopausal women with prior hysterectomy, conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) alone significantly reduced breast cancer incidence and breast cancer mortality. In contrast, epidemiological studies in a meta-analysis from the Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer (Collaborative Group) with 108,647 breast cancers and the Million Women's Study cohort significantly associated estrogen-alone therapy with higher breast cancer incidence and breast cancer mortality. The Collaborative Group included a meta-analysis of five smaller randomized trials and the WHI randomized trial; however, findings were restricted to the Collaborative Group appendix. Our objective is to facilitate understanding of these discordant results.

Methods

Data sources supporting our review findings include the randomized WHI CEE-alone trial and the meta-analysis of five smaller randomized trials evaluating estrogen alone. We summarize the smaller randomized trials' details of breast cancer relevance and place the findings in clinical context. We review findings of the WHI randomized trial evaluating CEE alone in the context of issues raised by Collaborative Group and the Million Women Study authors. We trace the evolution of the time-from-menopause, "window of opportunity" concept and augment the Collaborative Group meta-analysis by including the most recent WHI findings.

Discussion and Conclusions

Consideration of the smaller randomized trials evaluating estrogen alone with breast cancer signals that the WHI findings of lower breast cancer incidence and lower breast cancer mortality with CEE-alone use are not a "stand-alone" outcome or due to the play of chance. The serial reports of consistent favorable breast cancer findings through 20 years of cumulative follow-up suggest CEE-alone use initiates changes that persist. After full consideration of risks and benefits, randomized trial evidence provides reassurance for postmenopausal women with prior hysterectomy who are close to menopause considering estrogen alone for climacteric symptom management.

### How the women's health initiative (WHI) influenced physicians' practice and attitudes [^d0f659fc]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The landmark Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy Trial published in 2002 showed that the health risks of combination hormone therapy (HT) with estrogen and progestin outweighed the benefits in healthy postmenopausal women. Dissemination of results had a major impact on prescriptions for, and physician beliefs about HT. No study has fully examined the influence of the widely publicized WHI on physicians' practice and attitudes or their opinions of the scientific evidence regarding HT; in addition, little is known about how physicians assist women in their decisions regarding HT.

Design and Participants

We conducted in-depth telephone interviews with family practitioners, internists, and gynecologists from integrated health care delivery systems in Washington State (n = 10 physicians) and Massachusetts (n = 12 physicians). Our objectives were to obtain qualitative information from these physicians to understand their perspectives on use of HT, the scientific evidence regarding its risks and benefits, and counseling strategies around HT use and discontinuation.

Approach

We used Template Analysis to code transcribed telephone interviews and identify themes.

Results

Physicians were conflicted about the WHI results and its implications. Seven themes identified from in-depth interviews suggested that the WHI (1) was a ground-breaking study that changed clinical practice, including counseling; (2) was not applicable to the full range of patients seen in clinical practice; (3) raised concerns over the impact of publicized health information on women; (4) created uncertainty about the risks and benefits of HT; (5) called for the use of decision aids; (6) influenced discontinuation strategies; and (7) provided an opportunity to discuss healthy lifestyle options with patients. As a result of the WHI, physicians reported they no longer prescribe HT for prevention and were more likely to suggest discontinuation, although many felt women should be in charge of the HT decision.

Conclusions

Physicians varied in their opinions of HT and the scientific evidence (positive and negative). Whereas the WHI delineated the risks and benefits of HT, physicians reported that decision aids are needed to guide discussions with women about menopause and HT. Better guidance at the time of WHI study publication might have been valuable to ensure best practices.

### Should progestins be blamed for the failure of hormone replacement therapy to reduce cardiovascular events in randomized controlled trials? [^bd584996]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2004). Low credibility.

Many observational studies and experimental and animal studies have demonstrated that estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) (estrogen plus progestin) significantly reduces the risk of coronary heart disease. Nonetheless, recent randomized controlled trials demonstrated some trends toward an increased risk of cardiovascular events rather than a reduction of risk. Recently, both the HRT and ERT arms of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study were terminated early because of an increased/no incidence of invasive breast cancer, increased incidence of stroke, and increased trend/no protective effects of cardiovascular disease. We discuss the controversial effects of HRT and ERT on cardiovascular system and provide a hypothesis that the failure of HRT and ERT in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in postmenopausal women might be because of the stage of their atherosclerosis at the time of initiation of HRT or ERT.

### The impact of the women's health initiative on hormone replacement therapy in a medicaid program [^aeaa21ec]. Journal of Women's Health (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Observational studies suggest that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) reduces women's risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) HRT arm was stopped early because of increased risk of CVD, stroke, pulmonary embolism, and breast cancer. Evaluating HRT-prescribing patterns in relation to the release of the WHI will help determine if these study results have influenced the use of HRT.

Methods

This is a descriptive time series analysis to primarily evaluate utilization trends of HRT in women ≥ 50 years enrolled in the Pennsylvania Medicaid Program. HRT was categorized as follows: conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), CEE only, and other estrogens/progesterone combinations.

Results

The overall prevalence of HRT decreased significantly post-WHI study release for all age and racial groups. The prevalence of CEE plus MPA decreased throughout the study; however, the prevalence of HRT declined at a faster rate after the WHI study release among women in their 50s and 60s compared with women in their 70s and 80s. There was a statistically significant reduction in all types of HRT use.

Conclusions

The WHI influenced all types of HRT use among postmenopausal women in a Medicaid program. Administrative claims data can be a useful tool for monitoring an immediate impact of national guidelines or a national level outcomes trial.

### Recency and duration of postmenopausal hormone therapy: effects on bone mineral density and fracture risk in the national osteoporosis risk assessment (NORA) study [^706dedc3]. Menopause (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

Results from the Women's Health Initiative showed that postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) prevents fractures but has an overall unfavorable risk:benefit ratio, leading to the recommendation that HRT be used only for women with troublesome menopause symptoms, and for as short a time as possible. This recommendation has important implications for the timing and duration of HRT and the prevention of osteoporosis. The large number of women participating in the National Osteoporosis Risk Assessment (NORA) program provided the opportunity to evaluate bone mineral density (BMD) and 1-year fracture risk in analyses stratified by duration and recency of HRT.

Design

Participants were 170,852 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 104, without known osteoporosis, who were recruited from primary physicians offices across the US. BMD was measured at one of four peripheral sites, and the 1-year risk of osteoporotic fracture was assessed by questionnaire.

Results

At baseline, current HRT users had the highest T-scores at every age. Among current hormone users, women who had used HRT longest had the highest BMD levels. Women who had stopped HRT more than 5 years previously, regardless of duration of use, had T-scores similar to never-users. Current but not past hormone use at baseline was associated with a 25% to 29% lower risk of osteoporotic fracture (P < 0.0001) in 1 year, compared with nonusers. These findings were independent of age, ethnicity, body mass index, lifestyle, years postmenopausal, and site of BMD measurement.

Conclusions

We conclude that postmenopausal BMD and fracture are closely associated with current, but not prior, HRT use. Use of HRT for 5 years or less, as proposed for treatment of symptomatic women during menopause transition, is unlikely to preserve bone or significantly reduce fracture risk in later years.

### Treatment of menopausal symptoms in family medicine settings following the women's health initiative findings [^68d169ee]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study explores trends in treatment of menopausal symptoms and use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in family medicine settings subsequent to the release of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) findings.

Methods

Anonymous self-administered questionnaires were distributed to family medicine residents and faculty from 8 participating family medicine residency programs in the state of Florida. The survey asked physicians how they typically treated common menopausal symptoms in otherwise healthy menopausal women, and how their practice patterns had changed since the release of the WHI findings. We analyzed survey responses from 62 faculty and 148 residents (66% of eligible respondents).

Results

HRT is still prominent for treating irregular menses, vaginal dryness, vasomotor symptoms, and decreased libido. Faculty physicians were significantly more likely than residents to use HRT for menopausal symptoms. Female physicians were more likely than male physicians to say their treatment patterns had changed as a result of the WHI.

Conclusions

After weighing the evidence of potential risks of HRT from the WHI study, family medicine physicians altered and broadened their strategies for treating common menopausal symptoms. Although HRT remains a prominent treatment approach, there is now more physician-patient discussion of individual risks and benefits than occurred before the WHI's release of findings.

### Obesity and poor breast cancer prognosis: an illusion because of hormone replacement therapy? [^80be6399]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

We found that among women not using HRT, obese compared with normal weight women more often had large and progesterone receptor-positive tumours, but similar breast cancer-specific survival. On the other hand, obese women using oestrogen–progestin had worse tumour characteristics and prognosis compared with normal weight women.

Our findings of modest associations between obesity and poor tumour characteristics and no association with breast cancer-specific survival in never users of HRT contradict most earlier studies. Use of HRT became increasingly popular during the 1990s, but dropped substantially after the report of adverse effects from the Women's Health Initiative. Studies conducted on populations diagnosed with breast cancer before 2002 often have a large proportion of current HRT users. As indicated by our data, not taking HRT use into consideration could introduce spurious associations when analysing the influence of BMI on prognosis. However, two large and well-designed studies have found similar breast cancer survival regardless of BMI without taking HRT use into consideration.

Hormone replacement therapy and dementia: role of cardiovascular risk factors

The WHIMS (Women Health Initiative Memory Study) of women ≥ 65 years old is the only randomized, placebo‐controlled trial of menopausal hormone therapy for primary prevention of dementia. 96 Women with a uterus (n = 2947) were randomized to receive oral conjugated equine estrogen (CEE; 0.625 mg/d) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA; 2.5 mg/d CEE/MPA) or placebo. Women without a uterus (n = 4532) were randomized to receive oral CEE (0.625 mg/day) or placebo. Compared with placebo, CEE/MPA doubled the risk for all‐cause dementia, but CEE alone had no effect and these outcomes were not modified by smoking, CVD, stroke, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or statin or aspirin use. 96 Similar to dementia findings, CVD risk factors did not modify effects of hormone therapy on global cognitive function.

In a subgroup of WHIMS (n = 1424) who underwent brain MRI, ischemic brain volume (a measure of subclinical cerebrovascular disease) did not differ between hormone therapy and placebo groups, suggesting that ischemic changes were not the main mechanism underlying the observed increase in all‐cause dementia risk. 97 However, consistent with the stroke risk associated with hormone therapy found in the Women's Health Initiative, 98 rates of accumulation in white matter lesion volume and total brain lesion volume were higher among women with a history of CVD treated with hormone therapy versus placebo. 97

In contrast to the WHIMS, an 18‐year observational follow‐up study of 27 347 women in the Women's Health Initiative found a lower risk of mortality from Alzheimer dementia or dementia with CEE versus placebo, but no effect of CEE/MPA. 99 Mortality findings should be interpreted with caution due to the nonrandomized study design, and because the cause of death was determined by National Death Index search, or in some cases contacting next of kin, whereas 48% to 55% of dementia cases were prospectively adjudicated in WHIMS. Given that hormone therapy reduces diabetes mellitus risk, and diabetes mellitus is associated with increased risk of Alzheimer dementia and dementia, 100 additional investigation is needed to determine whether hormone therapy‐associated reductions in mortality from dementia are related to menopausal hormone therapy–associated reductions in diabetes mellitus.

Overall, there is limited evidence from the Women's Health Initiative to support the view that CVD risk factors or CVD history mediate effects of hormone therapy on dementia or cognition.

### The women's health initiative randomized trials and clinical practice… [^c58aca39]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Approximately 55 million people in the US and approximately 1. 1 billion people worldwide are postmenopausal women. To inform clinical practice about the health effects of menopausal hormone therapy, calcium plus vitamin D supplementation, and a low-fat dietary pattern, the Women's Health Initiative enrolled 161 808 postmenopausal US women aged 50 to 79 years at baseline from 1993 to 1998, and followed them up for up to 20 years. Observations The WHI clinical trial results do not support hormone therapy with oral conjugated equine estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone acetate for postmenopausal women or conjugated equine estrogens alone for those with prior hysterectomy to prevent cardiovascular disease, dementia, or other chronic diseases. However, hormone therapy is effective for treating moderate to severe vasomotor and other menopausal symptoms.

These benefits of hormone therapy in early menopause, combined with lower rates of adverse effects of hormone therapy in early compared with later menopause, support initiation of hormone therapy before age 60 years for women without contraindications to hormone therapy who have bothersome menopausal symptoms. The WHI results do not support routinely recommending calcium plus vitamin D supplementation for fracture prevention in all postmenopausal women. However, calcium and vitamin D are appropriate for women who do not meet national guidelines for recommended intakes of these nutrients through diet. A low-fat dietary pattern with increased fruit, vegetable, and grain consumption did not prevent the primary outcomes of breast or colorectal cancer but was associated with lower rates of the secondary outcome of breast cancer mortality during long-term follow-up.

Conclusions and Relevance For postmenopausal women, the WHI randomized clinical trials do not support menopausal hormone therapy to prevent cardiovascular disease or other chronic diseases. Menopausal hormone therapy is appropriate to treat bothersome vasomotor symptoms among women in early menopause, without contraindications, who are interested in taking hormone therapy. The WHI evidence does not support routine supplementation with calcium plus vitamin D for menopausal women to prevent fractures or a low-fat diet with increased fruits, vegetables, and grains to prevent breast or colorectal cancer. A potential role of a low-fat dietary pattern in reducing breast cancer mortality, a secondary outcome, warrants further study.

Women's Health Initiative Memory Study

The WHIMS estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI enrolled 2,947 predominantly healthy hysterectomized postmenopausal women 65 to 69 years of age (45 percent were 65 to 69 years of age, 36 percent were 70 to 74 years of age, and 19 percent were 75 years of age and older) to evaluate the effects of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone on the incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) compared to placebo.

After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, the relative risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 1.49 (95 percent CI, 0.83–2.66). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years. Probable dementia as defined in the study included Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD) and mixed type (having features of both AD and VaD). The most common classification of probable dementia in the treatment group and the placebo group was AD. Since the ancillary study was conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.

### Hormone replacement therapy and risk of cardiovascular disease: implications of the results of the women's health initiative [^1585f266]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2003). Low credibility.

The higher rates of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and venous thrombosis among women taking estrogen and progesterone (E+P) compared with placebo in the Women's Health Initiative clinical trial have important implications for women's health. Previous studies in both men and women have shown that estrogen therapy lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and raises high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The changes in these lipoproteins should be associated with at least a 30% decline in CHD risk. Estrogens increased very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglyceride levels and C-reactive protein. There is evidence that estrogens increase thrombin generation and fibrinolysis. The increase in VLDL triglycerides may enhance thrombotic risk as well as higher levels of atherogenic lipoproteins, such as dense low-density lipoprotein. Genetic variations in estrogen receptors and thrombosis or fibrinolysis may also be important in risks associated with E+P therapy. The increased risk of CHD and stroke with E+P therapy may be attributable to rise in VLDL triglycerides and thrombosis.

### A decade after the women's health initiative – the experts do agree [^36e57fef]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy — vascular risks — states that although the risks of venous thromboembolic events and ischemic stroke increase with either estrogen therapy or estrogen and progestogen therapy, the risk is rare in the 50- to 59-year-old age group; in observational studies, both transdermal estrogen therapy and low-dose oral estrogen therapy have been associated with lower risks of venous thromboembolic events and stroke than standard doses of oral estrogen, but comparison randomized clinical trials are not yet available.

### Is timing everything? A meeting report of the society for women's health research roundtable on menopausal hormone therapy [^102b122b]. Journal of Women's Health (2013). Low credibility.

The Society for Women's Health Research (SWHR) is a national, nonprofit organization based in Washington DC that is dedicated to transforming women's health through science, advocacy, and education. For more than 10 years, women and the physicians who treat them have been concerned about the safety of menopausal hormone therapy, largely since the early termination of two large federally funded studies. Considerable confusion remains despite decades of accumulated evidence from observational studies, clinical trials, and meta-analyses. In November 2012, SWHR convened 18 of the foremost experts within the field for a roundtable event to discuss the collective evidence related to the risks and benefits of hormone therapy. This report includes a synopsis of those discussions, the clinical statements that were generated and agreed upon, and the research recommendations suggested by the assembled experts.

### Synthetic conjugated estrogens, a (cenestin) [^51a3aac2]. FDA (2004). Low credibility.

Women's Health Initiative Memory Study

The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), a sub-study of WHI, enrolled 4,532 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older (47% were age 65 to 69 years, 35% were 70 to 74 years, and 18% were 75 years of age and older) to evaluate the effects of CE/MPA (0.625 mg conjugated estrogens plus 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate) on the incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) compared with placebo.

After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the estrogen/progestin group (45 per 10,000 women-years) and 21 in the placebo group (22 per 10,000 women-years) were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia in the hormone therapy group was 2.05 (95% CI, 1.21 to 3.48) compared to placebo. Differences between groups became apparent in the first year of treatment. It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women. (See BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS, Dementia .)

### Effects of estrogen plus progestin on risk of fracture and bone mineral density: the women's health initiative randomized trial [^8a33c8f1]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Context

In the Women's Health Initiative trial of estrogen-plus-progestin therapy, women assigned to active treatment had fewer fractures.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that the relative risk reduction of estrogen plus progestin on fractures differs according to risk factors for fractures.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized controlled trial (September 1993-July 2002) in which 16 608 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years with an intact uterus at baseline were recruited at 40 US clinical centers and followed up for an average of 5.6 years.

Intervention

Women were randomly assigned to receive conjugated equine estrogen, 0.625 mg/d, plus medroxyprogesterone acetate, 2.5 mg/d, in 1 tablet (n = 8506) or placebo (n = 8102).

Main Outcome Measures

All confirmed osteoporotic fracture events that occurred from enrollment to discontinuation of the trial (July 7, 2002); bone mineral density (BMD), measured in a subset of women (n = 1024) at baseline and years 1 and 3; and a global index, developed to summarize the balance of risks and benefits to test whether the risk-benefit profile differed across tertiles of fracture risk.

Results

Seven hundred thirty-three women (8.6%) in the estrogen-plus-progestin group and 896 women (11.1%) in the placebo group experienced a fracture (hazard ratio [HR], 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69–0.83). The effect did not differ in women stratified by age, body mass index, smoking status, history of falls, personal and family history of fracture, total calcium intake, past use of hormone therapy, BMD, or summary fracture risk score. Total hip BMD increased 3.7% after 3 years of treatment with estrogen plus progestin compared with 0.14% in the placebo group (P < .001). The HR for the global index was similar across tertiles of the fracture risk scale (lowest fracture risk tertile, HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.93–1.58; middle tertile, HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.04–1.46; highest tertile, HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.88–1.24) (P for interaction = .54).

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that estrogen plus progestin increases BMD and reduces the risk of fracture in healthy postmenopausal women. The decreased risk of fracture attributed to estrogen plus progestin appeared to be present in all subgroups of women examined. When considering the effects of hormone therapy on other important disease outcomes in a global model, there was no net benefit, even in women considered to be at high risk of fracture.

### Risks and benefits of estrogen plus progestin in healthy postmenopausal women: principal results from the women's health initiative randomized controlled trial [^3e48febc]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

The study WHI was published by Rossouw JE and colleagues in 2002 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Coronary artery disease and Menopause. In the WHI study, the trial question was: what is the role of estrogen plus progestin in healthy postmenopausal women? In the WHI study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the WHI study, the population was: 16608 female patients. The inclusion criteria were healthy postmenopausal women aged 50–79 years with an intact uterus at baseline. The key exclusion criteria were any medical condition likely to be associated with a predicted survival of < 3 years, prior breast cancer, other prior cancer within the last 10 years except nonmelanoma skin cancer, low hematocrit or platelet counts, alcoholism, or dementia. In the WHI study, the interventions were: n = 8506 estrogen plus progestin (conjugated equine estrogens, 0.625 mg/d, plus medroxyprogesterone acetate, 2.5 mg/d, in 1 tablet) n = 8102 placebo (matching placebo tablet). In the WHI study, the primary outcome was: borderline significant increase in nonfatal myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death (0.37% vs. 0.3%; HR 1.29, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.63). In the WHI study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in stroke (0.29% vs. 0.21%; HR 1.41, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.07) Borderline significant increase in venous thromboembolic disease (0.34% vs. 0.16%; HR 2.11, 95% CI 1.58 to 2.82) Borderline significant decrease in osteoporotic fractures (1.47% vs. 1.91%; HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.85). In the WHI study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in death and cause of death. significant difference in invasive breast cancer (0.38% per year vs. 0.30% per year). In the WHI study, the conclusion was: in healthy postmenopausal women aged 50–79 years with an intact uterus at baseline, estrogen plus progestin was inferior to placebo with respect to nonfatal myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death.

### Effect of estrogen plus progestin on global cognitive function in postmenopausal women: the women's health initiative memory study: a randomized controlled trial [^adc5907c]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Context

Observational studies have suggested that postmenopausal hormone treatment may improve cognitive function, but data from randomized clinical trials have been sparse and inconclusive. The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) is an ancillary study of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) hormone therapy trials. On July 8, 2002, the estrogen plus progestin therapy in the WHI trial was discontinued because of certain increased health risks for women.

Objective

To determine whether estrogen plus progestin therapy protects global cognitive function in older postmenopausal women.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, WHIMS is an ancillary study of geographically diverse, community-dwelling women aged 65 years or older from 39 of 40 clinical centers within the WHI estrogen plus progestin trial that started in June 1995. Of 4894 eligible postmenopausal women aged 65 years or older and free of probable dementia at baseline, 4532 (92.6%) were enrolled in the estrogen plus progestin component of WHIMS. A total of 4381 participants (96.7%) provided at least 1 valid cognitive function score between June 1995 and July 8, 2002.

Interventions

Participants received either 1 daily tablet containing 0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogen with 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate (n = 2145) or matching placebo (n = 2236).

Main Outcome Measure

Global cognitive function measured annually with the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination.

Results

The Modified Mini-Mental State Examination mean total scores in both groups increased slightly over time (mean follow-up of 4.2 years). Women in the estrogen plus progestin group had smaller average increases in total scores compared with women receiving placebo (P = 0.03), but these differences were not clinically important. Removing women by censoring them after adjudicated dementia, mild cognitive impairment, or stroke, and nonadherence to study protocol, did not alter the findings. Prior hormone therapy use and duration of prior use did not affect the interpretation of the results, nor did timing of prior hormone therapy initiation with respect to the final menstrual period. More women in the estrogen plus progestin group had a substantial and clinically important decline (≥ 2 SDs) in Modified Mini-Mental State Examination total score (6.7%) compared with the placebo group (4.8%) (P = 0.008).

Conclusions

Among postmenopausal women aged 65 years or older, estrogen plus progestin did not improve cognitive function when compared with placebo. While most women receiving estrogen plus progestin did not experience clinically relevant adverse effects on cognition compared with placebo, a small increased risk of clinically meaningful cognitive decline occurred in the estrogen plus progestin group.

### Health risks and benefits 3 years after stopping randomized treatment with estrogen and progestin [^433a6b00]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

Context

The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trial of estrogen plus progestin vs placebo was stopped early, after a mean 5.6 years of follow-up, because the overall health risks of hormone therapy exceeded its benefits.

Objective

To report health outcomes at 3 years (mean 2.4 years of follow-up) after the intervention was stopped.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The intervention phase was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) 0.625 mg daily plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 2.5 mg daily, in 16,608 women aged 50 through 79 years, recruited by 40 centers from 1993 to 1998. The postintervention phase commenced July 8, 2002, and included 15 730 women.

Main Outcome Measures

Semi-annual monitoring and outcomes ascertainment continued per trial protocol. The primary end points were coronary heart disease and invasive breast cancer. A global index summarizing the balance of risks and benefits included the 2 primary end points plus stroke, pulmonary embolism, endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, and death due to other causes.

Results

The risk of cardiovascular events after the intervention was comparable by initial randomized assignments, 1.97% (annualized rate) in the CEE plus MPA (343 events) and 1.91% in the placebo group (323 events). A greater risk of malignancies occurred in the CEE plus MPA than in the placebo group (1.56% [n = 281] vs 1.26% [n = 218]; hazard ratio [HR], 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04–1.48). More breast cancers were diagnosed in women who had been randomly assigned to receive CEE plus MPA vs placebo (0.42% [n = 79] vs 0.33% [n = 60]; HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.91–1.78) with a modest trend toward a lower HR during the follow-up after the intervention. All-cause mortality was somewhat higher in the CEE plus MPA than in the placebo group (1.20% [n = 233] vs 1.06% [n = 196]; HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.95–1.39). The global index of risks and benefits was unchanged from randomization through March 31, 2005 (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.03–1.21), indicating that the risks of CEE plus MPA exceed the benefits for chronic disease prevention.

Conclusions

The increased cardiovascular risks in the women assigned to CEE plus MPA during the intervention period were not observed after the intervention. A greater risk of fatal and nonfatal malignancies occurred after the intervention in the CEE plus MPA group and the global risk index was 12% higher in women randomly assigned to receive CEE plus MPA compared with placebo.

### Postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy: scientific review [^06dd5b84]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

Although postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is widely used in the United States, new evidence about its benefits and harms requires reconsideration of its use for the primary prevention of chronic conditions.

Objective

To assess the benefits and harms of HRT for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, thromboembolism, osteoporosis, cancer, dementia, and cholecystitis by reviewing the literature, conducting meta-analyses, and calculating outcome rates.

Data Sources

All relevant English-language studies were identified in MEDLINE (1966–2001), HealthSTAR (1975–2001), Cochrane Library databases, and reference lists of key articles. Recent results of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and the Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS) are included for reported outcomes.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

We used all published studies of HRT if they contained a comparison group of HRT nonusers and reported data relating to HRT use and clinical outcomes of interest. Studies were excluded if the population was selected according to prior events or presence of conditions associated with higher risks for targeted outcomes.

Data Synthesis

Meta-analyses of observational studies indicated summary relative risks (RRs) for coronary heart disease (CHD) incidence and mortality that were significantly reduced among current HRT users only, although risk for incidence was not reduced when only studies that controlled for socioeconomic status were included. The WHI reported increased CHD events (hazard ratio [HR], 1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02–1.63). Stroke incidence but not mortality was significantly increased among HRT users in the meta-analysis and the WHI. The meta-analysis indicated that risk was significantly elevated for thromboembolic stroke (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01–1.40) but not subarachnoid or intracerebral stroke. Risk of venous thromboembolism among current HRT users was increased overall (RR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.64–2.81) and was highest during the first year of use (RR, 3.49; 95% CI, 2.33–5.59) according to a meta-analysis of 12 studies. Protection against osteoporotic fractures is supported by a meta-analysis of 22 estrogen trials, cohort studies, results of the WHI, and trials with bone density outcomes. Current estrogen users have an increased risk of breast cancer that increases with duration of use. Endometrial cancer incidence, but not mortality, is increased with unopposed estrogen use but not with estrogen with progestin. A meta-analysis of 18 observational studies showed a 20% reduction in colon cancer incidence among women who had ever used HRT (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.74–0.86), a finding supported by the WHI. Women symptomatic from menopause had improvement in certain aspects of cognition. Current studies of estrogen and dementia are not definitive. In a cohort study, current HRT users had an age-adjusted RR for cholecystitis of 1.8 (95% CI, 1.6–2.0), increasing to 2.5 (95% CI, 2.0–2.9) after 5 years of use.

Conclusions

Benefits of HRT include prevention of osteoporotic fractures and colorectal cancer, while prevention of dementia is uncertain. Harms include CHD, stroke, thromboembolic events, breast cancer with 5 or more years of use, and cholecystitis.

### Health related quality of life after combined hormone replacement therapy: randomised controlled trial [^953a7531]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

The two trials used generic instruments for measuring quality of life, which are less sensitive to changes in health related quality of life resulting from a particular outcome or condition. Improvements in health related quality of life attributable to the presence or absence of postmenopausal symptoms might thus have been overlooked as generic instruments do not contain specific items on postmenopausal symptoms. Condition specific instruments might be more appropriate for use in a randomised controlled trial.

The women's international study of long duration oestrogen after the menopause (WISDOM) aimed to evaluate the long term benefits and risks of HRT. WISDOM was a placebo controlled, double blind randomised trial of HRT in postmenopausal women. It aimed to randomise 22 300 postmenopausal women aged 50–69 from primary care in the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand to HRT or placebo for a median of 10 years. In addition to the main clinical outcomes of cardiovascular disease, fractures, and breast cancer, WISDOM included a detailed assessment of the impact of HRT on health related quality of life. Recruitment began in 1999 and continued until October 2002, when the trial was closed after the announcement that the women's health initiative had been terminated early because the risks of combined HRT seemed to outweigh the benefits in that population.

We present findings from WISDOM for women with an intact uterus or subtotal hysterectomy who were randomised to combined HRT or placebo, focusing on health related quality of life measured at one year follow-up using both condition specific measures designed specifically for postmenopausal women and generic measures.

### Oestrogen plus progestin and lung cancer in postmenopausal women (women's health initiative trial): a post-hoc analysis of a randomised controlled trial [^7e634720]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

In the post-intervention period of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trial, women assigned to treatment with oestrogen plus progestin had a higher risk of cancer than did those assigned to placebo. Results also suggested that the combined hormone therapy might increase mortality from lung cancer. To assess whether such an association exists, we undertook a post-hoc analysis of lung cancers diagnosed in the trial over the entire follow-up period.

Methods

The WHI study was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial undertaken in 40 centres in the USA. 16 608 postmenopausal women aged 50–79 years with an intact uterus were randomly assigned by a computerised, stratified, permuted block algorithm to receive a once-daily tablet of 0.625 mg conjugated equine oestrogen plus 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (n = 8506) or matching placebo (n = 8102). We assessed incidence and mortality rates for all lung cancer, small-cell lung cancer, and non-small-cell lung cancer by use of data from treatment and post-intervention follow-up periods. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00000611.

Findings

After a mean of 5.6 years (SD 1.3) of treatment and 2.4 years (0.4) of additional follow-up, 109 women in the combined hormone therapy group had been diagnosed with lung cancer compared with 85 in the placebo group (incidence per year 0.16%vs 0.13%; hazard ratio [HR] 1.23, 95% CI 0.92–1.63, p = 0.16). 96 women assigned to combined therapy had non-small-cell lung cancer compared with 72 assigned to placebo (0.14%vs 0.11%; HR 1.28, 0.94–1.73, p = 0.12). More women died from lung cancer in the combined hormone therapy group than in the placebo group (73 vs 40 deaths; 0.11%vs 0.06%; HR 1.71, 1.16–2.52, p = 0.01), mainly as a result of a higher number of deaths from non-small-cell lung cancer in the combined therapy group (62 vs 31 deaths; 0.09%vs 0.05%; HR 1.87, 1.22–2.88, p = 0.004). Incidence and mortality rates of small-cell lung cancer were similar between groups.

Interpretation

Although treatment with oestrogen plus progestin in postmenopausal women did not increase incidence of lung cancer, it increased the number of deaths from lung cancer, in particular deaths from non-small-cell lung cancer. These findings should be incorporated into risk-benefit discussions with women considering combined hormone therapy, especially those with a high risk of lung cancer.

### After the women's health initiative: postmenopausal women's experiences with discontinuing estrogen replacement therapy [^45d0a51a]. Journal of Women's Health (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To gather information about women's responses to the publication of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and to determine what proportion of women stopped hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whether the technique of discontinuation affected the recurrence of menopausal symptoms.

Methods

73 subjects were identified through VA pharmacy records and were mailed a letter detailing the results of the WHI. A follow-up questionnaire was mailed several months later to the same population.

Results

48 subjects responded and were eligible for inclusion in the study. Mean age was 62 years; 37 (77%) stopped taking HRT, and 11 (23%) continued. Twenty patients stopped abruptly, and 17 tapered off HRT. Eight (40%) of the group who stopped abruptly experienced recurrent menopausal symptoms, compared with 12 (71%) of the group who tapered HRT.

Conclusions

In a population of women veterans, 77% stopped HRT after publication of the WHI. Tapering HRT, rather than stopping abruptly, did not reduce the recurrence of menopausal symptoms in our patient population.

Is There a Role for Menopausal HRT in the Prevention or Treatment of MASLD?

Evidence From Clinical Studies on HRT and MASLD

HRT is an effective treatment for numerous issues related to menopause including vasomotor symptoms and osteoporosis and can lead to significant improvements in quality of life. In recent decades, the role of HRT has been heavily debated based on evolving evidence on the safety profile of the treatment, particularly in relation to risk of coronary heart disease and cancer. Initial results from early randomized placebo-controlled studies such as the Women's Health Initiative suggesting that HRT increased the risk of coronary heart disease and breast cancer across the board in postmenopausal women were inappropriately interpreted and communicated with the public, leading to sharp declines in HRT prescriptions. Follow-up publications of the Women's Health Initiative randomized controlled trials shed light on the more nuanced relationship between HRT and these outcomes. The clearer results of these more recent studies are driving a push for better awareness and education on the evidence base in relation to HRT prescribing internationally. Shifting public perceptions toward HRT are particularly evident in the UK, where the number of HRT prescriptions annually have increased dramatically in the past decade.

### Type and timing of menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer risk: individual participant meta-analysis of the worldwide epidemiological evidence [^d6a91b46]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

There was extensive information in the prospective studies on the effects of starting MHT use at various ages throughout the range 40–59 years. For women who had started anywhere in this age range the RRs among current users were similar, and were all highly significant. Comparatively few women, however, had started such treatment well after the menopause, for example at ages 60–69 years. Among them, the excess risk was statistically definite for oestrogen-progestagen but not for oestrogen-only preparations, although this non-significant result should not be considered in isolation from the highly significant excess risks in the younger age groups.

Further evidence about the effects of starting the use of such treatments well after the menopause is provided by the randomised trials (appendix pp 29, 30), in which the main aim was to assess the effects of such treatments on vascular disease, which is uncommon before age 60 years. Much the largest were the two Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trials, one of oestrogen-only, the other of oestrogen-progestagen hormonal treatment. Both prespecified heart disease as the primary outcome, bone fracture as the main secondary outcome, and breast cancer as the main potential adverse outcome; their original power calculations considered the ability to detect a 15–22% increase in breast cancer.

In the oestrogen-only trials the average age at randomisation was 64 years and the mean between-group difference in the duration of hormone treatment during the scheduled intervention phase but before breast cancer onset was about 3.9 years, after allowing for non-compliance (appendix p 29). During or after the intervention phase a total of 434 women developed breast cancer (including 384 in the WHI trial, of whom 327 [85%] were overweight or obese). The aggregated results suggested an unexpected decrease in risk (RR 0.77, 99% CI 0.60–0.99, Z = –2.7, p = 0.01), possibly because starting oestrogen-only therapy well after the menopause does not have the same effect on breast cancer risk as starting at around the time of the menopause. Another possibility, given the epidemiological evidence that oestrogenic stimulation can increase risk and the strong randomised evidence that anti-oestrogen drugs can reduce risk in postmenopausal women, is that the apparently protective effect of hormone treatment in the oestrogen-only trials arose mainly by the play of chance, perhaps augmented by changes in breast density, somewhat reducing the sensitivity of mammographic screening.

### The kronos early estrogen prevention study (KEEPS): what have we learned? [^838160d8]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

The unexpected early termination of the estrogen plus progestin (E+P) portion of the Women's Health Initiative's (WHI) trial in 2002 for net harm, and of the WHI estrogen-only (ET) trial in 2004 for futility left scientists, physicians, and their patients with many concerns about the benefits and risks of menopausal hormone treatments (HT). Despite the large scale and high cost of the WHI, many questions remained unanswered and some new questions arose, the most critical being whether the WHI findings were affected by the fact that most women in the hormone trials were 5 or more years beyond their menopause on entry into the study and many had existing cardiovascular disease. As it seemed unlikely that the National Institutes of Health would fund another study to address these questions, the Kronos Longevity Research Institute, a privately funded non-profit institution located in Phoenix, AZ, brought together basic and clinical scientists, some of whom had been investigators in the WHI, from nine academic centers and one collaborating site across the country to design a new study named the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS). The primary goal of the KEEPS was to determine if, in women without preexisting cardiovascular disease, HT begun within 3 years of a woman's last menstrual period (2 y after the World Health Organization definition of menopause) would slow the progression of subclinical atherosclerosis as indicated by changes in carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT). Secondary goals included evaluation of risk factors for cardiovascular disease and measurement of coronary artery calcium (CAC). Other goals included aspects of postmenopausal health, risks, and evidence for adverse side effects. This review summarizes what has been learned from the KEEPS during the past decade, including multiple ancillary studies that have provided new insights into cognitive function, mood/affective outcomes, brain structure, menopausal symptoms including sleep quality and sexual function, bone health, metabolism, biomarkers for disease processes, breast pain, and pharmacogenomics of HT. The strengths and shortcomings of these data will be discussed as they may inform current use of HT and guide future research in this field.

### Use of menopausal hormone therapy beyond age 65 years and its effects on women's health outcomes by types, routes, and doses [^74964769]. Menopause (2024). Medium credibility.

In 2002, the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trial reported that menopausal estrogen + progestogen therapy (EPT) in menopausal women average age 63 years increased the occurrence of invasive breast cancer, stroke, and coronary heart disease, although it reduced fractures. The press presented the negative outcomes in a dramatic manner that some described as misleading. However, most of these negative results lost significance when corrected for multiple testing. The second WHI study in 2004 examined the effect of estrogen therapy (ET) on these same outcomes in similar aged but hysterectomized women and reported a near significant reduction in breast cancer, which became a significant 22% reduction in WHI's long-term follow-up of that study. However, these positive results got little press attention and did little to reduce the fears about hormone therapy (HT) that had been already implanted in the public's mind. The US Food and Drug Administration has required all estrogen-containing products to include a black-box warning for serious adverse events associated with its use, even though the WHI trials only studied one type (conjugated estrogen), dosage (0.625 mg), and route (oral) of estrogen alone and in combination with one type of progestogen (medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg). Furthermore, continuing or initiating HT after 65 years is rarely recommended. Until recently, it was often thought that women do not need hormone therapy much after menopause because no serious menopausal symptoms persist in women aged 65 years or older. However, studies reported that menopausal vasomotor symptoms persisted for 7–12 years in many women, and some vasomotor symptoms persisted in 42.1% of women aged 60–65 years, which suggests that not few numbers of women continue to suffer from vasomotor symptoms even after age 65 years. According to the 2022 HT position statement of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS), there is no general rule for stopping HT in a woman aged 65 years. For healthy women with persistent vasomotor symptoms, continuing HT beyond age 65 years is a reasonable option with appropriate counseling and regular assessment of risks and benefits. Moreover, the mitigation of risks through the choice of low dose, nonoral, and different estrogen and progestogen becomes increasingly important as women age. However, information on the effects of different HT formulation, dosing, and route of administration is lacking.

### Estrogen plus progestin and breast cancer incidence and mortality in postmenopausal women [^de4588bb]. JAMA (2010). Excellent credibility.

Context

In the Women's Health Initiative randomized, placebo-controlled trial of estrogen plus progestin, after a mean intervention time of 5.6 (SD, 1.3) years (range, 3.7–8.6 years) and a mean follow-up of 7.9 (SD, 1.4) years, breast cancer incidence was increased among women who received combined hormone therapy. Breast cancer mortality among participants in the trial has not been previously reported.

Objective

To determine the effects of therapy with estrogen plus progestin on cumulative breast cancer incidence and mortality after a total mean follow-up of 11.0 (SD, 2.7) years, through August 14, 2009.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A total of 16,608 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years with no prior hysterectomy from 40 US clinical centers were randomly assigned to receive combined conjugated equine estrogens, 0.625 mg/d, plus medroxyprogesterone acetate, 2.5 mg/d, or placebo pill. After the original trial completion date (March 31, 2005), reconsent was required for continued follow-up for breast cancer incidence and was obtained from 12,788 (83%) of the surviving participants.

Main Outcome Measures

Invasive breast cancer incidence and breast cancer mortality.

Results

In intention-to-treat analyses including all randomized participants and censoring those not consenting to additional follow-up on March 31, 2005, estrogen plus progestin was associated with more invasive breast cancers compared with placebo (385 cases [0.42% per year] vs 293 cases [0.34% per year]; hazard ratio [HR], 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07–1.46; P = 0.004). Breast cancers in the estrogen-plus-progestin group were similar in histology and grade to breast cancers in the placebo group but were more likely to be node-positive (81 [23.7%] vs 43 [16.2%], respectively; HR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.23–2.58; P = 0.03). There were more deaths directly attributed to breast cancer (25 deaths [0.03% per year] vs 12 deaths [0.01% per year]; HR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.00–4.04; P = 0.049) as well as more deaths from all causes occurring after a breast cancer diagnosis (51 deaths [0.05% per year] vs 31 deaths [0.03% per year]; HR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.01–2.48; P = 0.045) among women who received estrogen plus progestin compared with women in the placebo group.

Conclusions

Estrogen plus progestin was associated with greater breast cancer incidence, and the cancers are more commonly node-positive. Breast cancer mortality also appears to be increased with combined use of estrogen plus progestin.

### Menopausal hormone therapy and long-term all-cause and cause-specific mortality: the women's health initiative randomized trials [^18d77248]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Health outcomes from the Women's Health Initiative Estrogen Plus Progestin and Estrogen-Alone Trials have been reported, but previous publications have generally not focused on all-cause and cause-specific mortality.

Objective

To examine total and cause-specific cumulative mortality, including during the intervention and extended postintervention follow-up, of the 2 Women's Health Initiative hormone therapy trials.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Observational follow-up of US multiethnic postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years enrolled in 2 randomized clinical trials between 1993 and 1998 and followed up through December 31, 2014.

Interventions

Conjugated equine estrogens (CEE, 0.625 mg/d) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA, 2.5 mg/d) (n = 8506) vs placebo (n = 8102) for 5.6 years (median) or CEE alone (n = 5310) vs placebo (n = 5429) for 7.2 years (median).

Main Outcomes and Measures

All-cause mortality (primary outcome) and cause-specific mortality (cardiovascular disease mortality, cancer mortality, and other major causes of mortality) in the 2 trials pooled and in each trial individually, with prespecified analyses by 10-year age group based on age at time of randomization.

Results

Among 27 347 women who were randomized (baseline mean [SD] age, 63.4 [7.2] years; 80.6% white), mortality follow-up was available for more than 98%. During the cumulative 18-year follow-up, 7489 deaths occurred (1088 deaths during the intervention phase and 6401 deaths during postintervention follow-up). All-cause mortality was 27.1% in the hormone therapy group vs 27.6% in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.99 [95% CI, 0.94–1.03]) in the overall pooled cohort; with CEE plus MPA, the HR was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.96–1.08); and with CEE alone, the HR was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.88–1.01). In the pooled cohort for cardiovascular mortality, the HR was 1.00 (95% CI, 0.92–1.08 [8.9% with hormone therapy vs 9.0% with placebo]); for total cancer mortality, the HR was 1.03 (95% CI, 0.95–1.12 [8.2% with hormone therapy vs 8.0% with placebo]); and for other causes, the HR was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.88–1.02 [10.0% with hormone therapy vs 10.7% with placebo]), and results did not differ significantly between trials. When examined by 10-year age groups comparing younger women (aged 50–59 years) to older women (aged 70–79 years) in the pooled cohort, the ratio of nominal HRs for all-cause mortality was 0.61 (95% CI, 0.43–0.87) during the intervention phase and the ratio was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.76–1.00) during cumulative 18-year follow-up, without significant heterogeneity between trials.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among postmenopausal women, hormone therapy with CEE plus MPA for a median of 5.6 years or with CEE alone for a median of 7.2 years was not associated with risk of all-cause, cardiovascular, or cancer mortality during a cumulative follow-up of 18 years.

### Complex actions of sex steroids in adipose tissue, the cardiovascular system, and brain: insights from basic science and clinical studies [^43f13e4a]. Endocrine Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Recent publications describing the results of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and other studies reporting the impact of hormone therapy on aging women have spurred reexamination of the broad use of estrogens and progestins during the postmenopausal years. Here, we review the complex pharmacology of these hormones, the diverse and sometimes opposite effects that result from the use of different estrogenic and progestinic compounds, given via different delivery routes in different concentrations and treatment sequence, and to women of different ages and health status. We examine our new and growing appreciation of the role of estrogens in the immune system and the inflammatory response, and we pose the concept that estrogen's interface with this system may be at the core of some of the effects on multiple physiological systems, such as the adipose/metabolic system, the cardiovascular system, and the central nervous system. We compare and contrast clinical and basic science studies as we focus on the actions of estrogens in these systems because the untoward effects of hormone therapy reported in the WHI were not expected. The broad interpretation and publicity of the results of the WHI have resulted in a general condemnation of all hormone replacement in postmenopausal women. In fact, careful review of the extensive literature suggests that data resulting from the WHI and other recent studies should be interpreted within the narrow context of the study design. We argue that these results should encourage us to perform new studies that take advantage of a dialogue between basic scientists and clinician scientists to ensure appropriate design, incorporation of current knowledge, and proper interpretation of results. Only then will we have a better understanding of what hormonal compounds should be used in which populations of women and at what stages of menopausal/postmenopausal life.

### Management of cardiovascular risk in the peri-menopausal woman: a consensus statement of European cardiologists and gynaecologists [^8ef6b6b1]. European Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular risk is poorly managed in women, especially during the menopausal transition when susceptibility to cardiovascular events increases. Clear gender differences exist in the epidemiology, symptoms, diagnosis, progression, prognosis, and management of cardiovascular risk. Key risk factors that need to be controlled in the peri-menopausal woman are hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obesity, and other components of the metabolic syndrome, with the avoidance and careful control of diabetes. Hypertension is a particularly powerful risk factor and lowering of blood pressure is pivotal. Hormone replacement therapy is acknowledged as the gold standard for the alleviation of the distressing vasomotor symptoms of the menopause, but the findings of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study generated concern for the detrimental effect on cardiovascular events. Thus, hormone replacement therapy cannot be recommended for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Whether the findings of WHI in older post-menopausal women can be applied to younger peri-menopausal women is unknown. It is increasingly recognized that hormone therapy is inappropriate for older post-menopausal women no longer displaying menopausal symptoms. Both gynaecologists and cardiovascular physicians have an important role to play in identifying peri-menopausal women at risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and should work as a team to identify and manage risk factors such as hypertension.

### Health related quality of life after combined hormone replacement therapy: randomised controlled trial [^a9354bd6]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

Relevance of findings

The results of WISDOM are clinically relevant for doctors treating postmenopausal women with relevant symptoms including vasomotor symptoms, sleep disturbance, and aching joints and muscles. When women start combined HRT many years after the menopause they must balance the risk of increased cardiac events, venous thromboembolism, and breast cancer against possible benefits on health related quality of life. They must also consider possible early side effects of combined HRT such as breast tenderness, vaginal discharge, and uterine bleeding, which usually resolve with time or dose titration. These side effects are common hyperoestrogenic symptoms and might reflect the fixed dose regimen in this trial, which was relatively high for women aged over 60.

These results should be interpreted with caution, as the presence of statistical significance does not imply clinical significance. Differences between treatments for most of the health related quality of life measures in this study were small, with the exception of improvements related to vasomotor symptoms, and most measures were not affected by combined HRT. Conversely, because WISDOM and previous randomised controlled trials such as the women's health initiative and the heart and oestrogen/progestin replacement study (HERS) included women well past the menopause who were mainly asymptomatic, the results of these trials are likely to underestimate the positive effects of combined HRT on health related quality of life for women with symptoms. There is much background literature and guidelines that support the premise that women with debilitating menopause symptoms will have the most benefit in health related quality of life from treatment with combined HRT. This is an important message to convey to women with severe menopausal symptoms. Additionally, for younger women, recent data suggest a more favourable risk profile for combined HRT when it is started within a few years of menopause compared with many years after.

The women's health initiative (and to a lesser extent WISDOM) have helped to answer the question as to whether some chronic diseases could be prevented or ameliorated when combined HRT is started many years after the menopause. Chronic disease outcomes should not be considered in isolation from outcomes of health related quality of life in this age group.

### Estrogen, hormonal replacement therapy and cardiovascular disease [^b751e4e3]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Premenopausal women have a lower risk and incidence of hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to age-matched men and this sex advantage for women gradually disappears after menopause, suggesting that sexual hormones play a cardioprotective role in women. However, randomized prospective primary or secondary prevention trials failed to confirm that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) affords cardioprotection. This review highlights the factors that may contribute to this divergent outcome and could reveal why young or premenopausal women are protected from CVD and yet postmenopausal women do not benefit from HRT.

Recent Findings

In addition to the two classical estrogen receptors, ERα and ERβ, a third, G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor GPR30, has been identified. New intracellular signaling pathways and actions for the cardiovascular protective properties of estrogen have been proposed. In addition, recent Women's Health Initiative (WHI) studies restricted to younger postmenopausal women showed that initiation of HRT closer to menopause reduced the risk of CVD. Moreover, dosage, duration, the type of estrogen and route of administration all merit consideration when determining the outcome of HRT.

Summary

HRT has become one of the most controversial topics related to women's health. Future studies are necessary if we are to understand the divergent published findings regarding HRT and develop new therapeutic strategies to improve the quality of life for women.

### Estrogen and cardiovascular disease [^77dfbdcd]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

A large body of scientific research accumulated over the past twenty years documents the cardiovascular (CV) benefits of estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) in reproductive aged women. In contrast, accelerated development of CV disease (CVD) occurs in the absence of ovarian produced E2 and P4. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with E2 and P4 has been shown to cause no harm to younger menopausal women. This robust scientific data supports a reconsideration of the prescriptive use of E2 and P4 as preventative therapeutics for the reduction of CVD, even without additional large-scale studies of the magnitude of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). With the current expanded understanding of the critical modulatory role played by E2 on a multitude of systems and enzymes impacting CVD onset, initiation of HRT shortly after cessation of ovarian function, known as the "Timing Hypothesis", should be considered to delay CVD in recently postmenopausal women.

### Menopausal hormone therapy: currently no evidence for cardiac protection [^abe43a43]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death among women of older age. Interest emerged as to whether premenopausal endogenous estrogen conferred cardiac protection and whether menopausal hormone therapy might prove beneficial. The results of pivotal clinical trials including the randomized, placebo-controlled hormone trial of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and the Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS) have led to new Guidelines from the American Heart Association (AHA) that state that hormone therapy should not be initiated or continued for the primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in menopausal women.

### Breast cancer after use of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen alone: analyses of data from 2 women's health initiative randomized clinical trials [^7a7009d2]. JAMA Oncology (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

The use of menopausal hormone therapy (HT) continues in clinical practice, but reports are conflicting concerning the longer-term breast cancer effects of relatively short-term use.

Objective

To report the longer-term influence of menopausal HT on breast cancer incidence in the 2 Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized clinical trials.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A total of 27,347 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years were enrolled at 40 US centers from 1993 to 1998 and followed up for a median of 13 years through September 2010.

Interventions

A total of 16,608 women with a uterus were randomized to conjugated equine estrogens (0.625 mg/d [estrogen]) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (2.5 mg/d [progestin]) (E+P) or placebo with a median intervention duration of 5.6 years, and 10,739 women with prior hysterectomy were randomized to conjugated equine estrogens alone (0.625 mg/d) or placebo with a median intervention duration of 7.2 years.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Time-specific invasive breast cancer incidence rates and exploratory analyses of breast cancer characteristics by intervention and postintervention phases in the 2 HT trials.

Results

In the E+P trial, hazard ratios (HRs) for the influence of combined HT on breast cancer were lower than 1 for 2 years (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.47–1.08) and steadily increased throughout intervention, becoming significantly increased for the entire intervention phase (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.01–1.53). In the early postintervention phase (within 2.75 years from intervention), there was a sharp decrease in breast cancer incidence in the combined HT group, though the HR remained higher than 1 (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.90–1.70). During the late postintervention phase (requiring patient re-consent), the HR for breast cancer risk remained higher than 1 through 5.5 years (median) of additional follow-up (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.06–1.77). In the estrogen alone trial, the HR for invasive breast cancer risk was lower than 1 throughout the intervention phase (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.61–1.02) and remained lower than 1 in the early postintervention phase (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.34–0.89), but risk reduction was not observed during the late postintervention follow-up (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.73–1.87). Characteristics of breast cancers diagnosed during early and late postintervention phases differed in both trials.

Conclusions and Relevance

In the E+P trial, the higher breast cancer risk seen during intervention was followed by a substantial drop in risk in the early postintervention phase, but a higher breast cancer risk remained during the late postintervention follow-up. In the estrogen alone trial, the lower breast cancer risk seen during intervention was sustained in the early postintervention phase but was not evident during the late postintervention follow-up.

### Estrogen-plus-progestin use and mammographic density in postmenopausal women: women's health initiative randomized trial [^004c29cb]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Increased mammographic density reduces the sensitivity of screening mammography, is associated with increased breast cancer risk, and may be hormone related. We assessed the effect of estrogen-plus-progestin therapy on mammographic density.

Methods

In a racially and ethnically diverse ancillary study of the Women's Health Initiative, we examined data from 413 postmenopausal women who had been randomly assigned to receive daily combined conjugated equine estrogens (0.625 mg) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (i.e., progestin; 2.5 mg) (n = 202) or daily placebo (n = 211). We assessed the effect of estrogen plus progestin on measured mammographic percent density and abnormal findings over a 1-year and 2-year period. All tests of statistical significance were two-sided and were based on F tests or t tests from mixed-effects models.

Results

Mean mammographic percent density increased by 6.0% at year 1, compared with baseline, in the estrogen-plus-progestin group but decreased by 0.9% in the placebo group (difference = 6.9%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.3% to 8.5%; P < .001). The mean changes in mammographic density persisted but were attenuated slightly after 2 years, with an absolute increase of 4.9% in the estrogen-plus-progestin group and a decrease of 0.8% in the placebo group (difference = 5.7%, 95% CI = 4.3% to 7.3%; P < .001). These effects were consistent across racial/ethnic groups but were higher among women aged 70–79 years in the estrogen-plus-progestin group (mean increase at year 1 = 11.6%) than in the placebo group (mean decrease at year 1 = 0.1%) (difference of the means = 11.7%, 95% CI = 8.2% to 15.4%; P < .001, comparing across age groups). At year 1, women who were adherent to treatment in the estrogen-plus-progestin group had a mean increase in density of 7.7% (95% CI = 5.9% to 9.5%), and women in the placebo group had a mean decrease in density of 1.1% (95% CI = 0.3% to 1.9%). Use of estrogen plus progestin was associated with an increased risk of having an abnormal mammogram at year 1 (relative risk = 3.9, 95% CI = 1.5 to 10.2; P = 0.003), compared with placebo, that was not explained by an increase in density.

Conclusions

Use of up to 2 years of estrogen plus progestin was associated with increases in mammographic density.

### Risks and benefits of estrogen plus progestin in healthy postmenopausal women: principal results from the women's health initiative randomized controlled trial [^12b9a8db]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

Despite decades of accumulated observational evidence, the balance of risks and benefits for hormone use in healthy postmenopausal women remains uncertain.

Objective

To assess the major health benefits and risks of the most commonly used combined hormone preparation in the United States.

Design

Estrogen plus progestin component of the Women's Health Initiative, a randomized controlled primary prevention trial (planned duration, 8.5 years) in which 16608 postmenopausal women aged 50–79 years with an intact uterus at baseline were recruited by 40 US clinical centers in 1993–1998.

Interventions

Participants received conjugated equine estrogens, 0.625 mg/d, plus medroxyprogesterone acetate, 2.5 mg/d, in 1 tablet (n = 8506) or placebo (n = 8102).

Main Outcomes Measures

The primary outcome was coronary heart disease (CHD) (nonfatal myocardial infarction and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A global index summarizing the balance of risks and benefits included the 2 primary outcomes plus stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, and death due to other causes.

Results

On May 31, 2002, after a mean of 5.2 years of follow-up, the data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping the trial of estrogen plus progestin vs placebo because the test statistic for invasive breast cancer exceeded the stopping boundary for this adverse effect and the global index statistic supported risks exceeding benefits. This report includes data on the major clinical outcomes through April 30, 2002. Estimated hazard ratios (HRs) (nominal 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were as follows: CHD, 1.29 (1.02–1.63) with 286 cases; breast cancer, 1.26 (1.00–1.59) with 290 cases; stroke, 1.41 (1.07–1.85) with 212 cases; PE, 2.13 (1.39–3.25) with 101 cases; colorectal cancer, 0.63 (0.43–0.92) with 112 cases; endometrial cancer, 0.83 (0.47–1.47) with 47 cases; hip fracture, 0.66 (0.45–0.98) with 106 cases; and death due to other causes, 0.92 (0.74–1.14) with 331 cases. Corresponding HRs (nominal 95% CIs) for composite outcomes were 1.22 (1.09–1.36) for total cardiovascular disease (arterial and venous disease), 1.03 (0.90–1.17) for total cancer, 0.76 (0.69–0.85) for combined fractures, 0.98 (0.82–1.18) for total mortality, and 1.15 (1.03–1.28) for the global index. Absolute excess risks per 10 000 person-years attributable to estrogen plus progestin were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 8 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while absolute risk reductions per 10 000 person-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures. The absolute excess risk of events included in the global index was 19 per 10 000 person-years.

Conclusions

Overall health risks exceeded benefits from use of combined estrogen plus progestin for an average 5.2-year follow-up among healthy postmenopausal US women. All-cause mortality was not affected during the trial. The risk-benefit profile found in this trial is not consistent with the requirements for a viable intervention for primary prevention of chronic diseases, and the results indicate that this regimen should not be initiated or continued for primary prevention of CHD.

### Hormone replacement therapy in endometrial cancer survivors: new perspectives after the heart and estrogen progestin replacement study and the women's health initiative [^dd53e1a0]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Dramatic shifts in prescription practices during the last 30 years have left physicians confused and uncertain about the use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in endometrial cancer survivors.

Materials and Methods

This article reviews the published literature concerning both the safety of prescribing HRT to endometrial cancer survivors and the therapy s potential risks and benefits.

Results

Prescribing HRT to endometrial cancer survivors does not seem to be contraindicated and may even confer modest protection, depending on the doses and the specific drugs used. The potential benefits of HRT are more conflicting. Although the medical community agrees on the positive effects for bone density and relief of vasomotor symptoms, the results of our review offer no clear consensus in regard to HRT's effects on coronary heart disease, health-related quality of life, cognitive functioning, and cancer incidence.

Conclusions

Until the medical community can concur on the proper prescription practices in endometrial cancer survivors, an individualized patient-based approach must be taken.

Introduction

The quality of an individual's life is an important end point in medical and health outcomes research. In many circumstances quality of survival is as important as quantity. Health related quality of life is a reflection of the way patients feel or function. There is debate about the effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on health related quality of life, though it has been shown to improve general quality of life through the reduction of both the number and severity of menopausal symptoms.

The perception of the risks and benefits of HRT and its timing has changed dramatically since the publication of the women's health initiative trial in 2002. That study of women initiating HRT on average 13 years after menopause did not find long term benefits on cardiovascular outcomes, previously suggested by observational studies of women initiating HRT near menopause. The impact of HRT on patient centred outcomes such as health related quality of life was questioned. Although the study reported a significant benefit of combined oestrogen and progestogen (combined HRT) in health related quality of life related to sleep disturbance, physical functioning, and bodily pain, the differences were small, and for conjugated equine oestrogen no effect was found in women who had had a hysterectomy. The smaller heart and oestrogen/progestin replacement study (HERS) found that menopausal symptoms modified the effect of HRT on health related quality of life: women without flushing had greater declines in health related quality of life related to physical measures, while those with flushing experienced improvements in health related quality of life related to emotional measures. Previous studies have suggested that HRT has an important positive impact on various symptoms of the menopause and thus overall health related quality of life.

### Hormone therapy initiation after the women's health initiative [^4734f614]. Menopause (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To describe hormone therapy (HT) initiation after the 2002 publication of the Women's Health Initiative.

Design

Observational cohort (1999–2003) of women ages 40 to 79 years, five health plans, used HT in July 2002 and subsequently discontinued or never used before August 2002.

Results

Of discontinuers, 15.8% (3,203 of 20,205) reinitiated HT. Reinitiation was higher among estrogen users (23.8%) versus estrogen with progestin users (11.3%), and lower among those with diabetes (relative risk [RR] = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.61–0.76), cardiovascular disease (RR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.83–0.92), and hyperlipidemia (RR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.79–0.88). Only 2.3% (2,072 of 90,261) of never users initiated (August 2002 to December 2003). First-time initiation was associated with cardiovascular disease (RR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.10–1.25) and hyperlipidemia (RR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.17–1.33) and was less common among those with diabetes (RR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.63–0.79).

Conclusions

After the Women's Health Initiative, a minority of women reinitiated or became first-time initiators of HT. Women with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia were less likely to reinitiate; women with cardiovascular disease and hyperlipidemia were more likely to be first-time initiators.

### Age at menopause and lifetime cognition: findings from a British birth cohort study [^299be85d]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

The effects of HRT use on cognition or dementia risk were originally thought to be positive, until the results of the Women's Health Initiative showed adverse effects in older women. The possibility that HRT could be beneficial during a "critical window" at the time of the menopause transition, led to a follow-up studyand recent trials in younger women, that showed no such beneficial effects on cognition. Our study showed that, for most women, there was no evidence that HRT use promoted better cognitive performance — indeed, estimates were generally negative. Our additional analyses showed HRT use was only protective for processing speed in women with a bilateral oophorectomy. HRT use decreased in this cohort during 2002 (age 56) at the time of adverse trial reports, and later-born cohorts have been less likely to use HRT. Therefore, our HRT results may not be generalizable to later-born cohorts. Given the decrease in HRT use, HRT may have only been prescribed to women at probable high risk of adverse health conditions thought to be associated with early period cessation. This could have weakened any positive associations between HRT use and cognition. However, our findings are consistent with the recent trials in younger women, and with the Women's Health Initiative/Women's Health Initiative Memory Study, which showed an increase in dementia cases in women aged 65 to 79 years in the combined and estrogen-only arms of the trial. Findings from the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study–MRI were consistent in showing that women receiving HRT had significant losses of gray matter compared with the placebo groups.

### Main morbidities recorded in the women's international study of long duration oestrogen after menopause (WISDOM): a randomised controlled trial of hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women [^bdb0d8ca]. BMJ (2007). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess the long term risks and benefits of hormone replacement therapy (combined hormone therapy versus placebo, and oestrogen alone versus combined hormone therapy).

Design

Multicentre, randomised, placebo controlled, double blind trial.

Setting

General practices in UK (384), Australia (91), and New Zealand (24).

Participants

Postmenopausal women aged 50–69 years at randomisation. At early closure of the trial, 56,583 had been screened, 8980 entered run-in, and 5692 (26% of target of 22,300) started treatment.

Interventions

Oestrogen only therapy (conjugated equine oestrogens 0.625 mg orally daily) or combined hormone therapy (conjugated equine oestrogens plus medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5/5.0 mg orally daily). Ten years of treatment planned.

Primary Outcomes

major cardiovascular disease, osteoporotic fractures, and breast cancer.

Secondary Outcomes

other cancers, death from all causes, venous thromboembolism, cerebrovascular disease, dementia, and quality of life.

Results

The trial was prematurely closed during recruitment, after a median follow-up of 11.9 months (interquartile range 7.1–19.6, total 6498 women years) in those enrolled, after the publication of early results from the women's health initiative study. The mean age of randomised women was 62.8 (SD 4.8) years. When combined hormone therapy (n = 2196) was compared with placebo (n = 2189), there was a significant increase in the number of major cardiovascular events (7 v 0, P = 0.016) and venous thromboembolisms (22 v 3, hazard ratio 7.36 (95% CI 2.20 to 24.60)). There were no statistically significant differences in numbers of breast or other cancers (22 v 25, hazard ratio 0.88 (0.49 to 1.56)), cerebrovascular events (14 v 19, 0.73 (0.37 to 1.46)), fractures (40 v 58, 0.69 (0.46 to 1.03)), and overall deaths (8 v 5, 1.60 (0.52 to 4.89)). Comparison of combined hormone therapy (n = 815) versus oestrogen therapy (n = 826) outcomes revealed no significant differences.

Conclusions

Hormone replacement therapy increases cardiovascular and thromboembolic risk when started many years after the menopause. The results are consistent with the findings of the women's health initiative study and secondary prevention studies. Research is needed to assess the long term risks and benefits of starting hormone replacement therapy near the menopause, when the effect may be different.

### The effects of transdermal and oral oestrogen replacement therapy on colorectal cancer risk in postmenopausal women [^9ec3bd1b]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

The release of results from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and the Heart and Oestrogen/Progestin Replacement Study (HERS II) trials in July 2002 clarified some of the risks and benefits of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) that have been debated for decades. Currently, most experts appear to agree that only women experiencing menopausal symptoms should be prescribed oral combined oestrogen–progestagen therapy, since among older postmenopausal women the evidence suggests that the risk of overall harm outweighs the potential for benefit. Experts also agree that systemic hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for vasomotor and other menopausal symptoms. Hence, for 10–25% of postmenopausal women who experience distressing menopausal symptoms, HRT will continue to be a therapy of choice.

The results from the WHI randomised controlled trial and numerous observational studies are consistent in their findings that suggest that HRT is protective against colorectal cancer. All of these studies, however, have focused exclusively on the use of oral oestrogen (OE). This may be due in part to the higher prevalence of OE use among women, compared with transdermal oestrogen (TDE). However, since the availability of TDE in the mid-1980s, its use has been increasing in both Canada and the US.

While evidence from clinical studies demonstrate important metabolic and biologic differences between oral and transdermal HRT, limited information is available relating the mode of hormone delivery (oral vs transdermal) to clinically important outcomes. Faced with the decision to begin HRT or not, women need to weigh the health risks against the benefits of menopausal symptom control. Provided that there is sufficient knowledge about the health effects of various HRT formulations and modes of delivery, women and their physicians could potentially individualise treatment with HRT to minimise the health risks and optimise benefit.

In this population-based case–control study, we examine the effects of transdermal and OE administration on the risk of colorectal cancer in peri- and postmenopausal women.

### The effect of hormone replacement therapy on cognition and mood [^21dd7422]. Clinical Endocrinology (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
The effect of hormone replacement therapy on cognition. Graphical representation of the balance of evidence for benefits versus harm of HRT on cognition in perimenopausal or menopausal women in a mixed age group (1A), and women below (1B) and above (1C) 60‐year‐old. Small, medium and large font size of citations is used for studies recruiting ≤ 100 participants, 100–999, and ≥ 1000, respectively. [Color figure can be viewed at]

An extensive series of multicentre trials, conducted under the umbrella of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) on the use of HRT in postmenopausal women, was published in 2002 and 2004. One such trial was the WHI Study of Cognitive Aging which observed a decline in cognition in women receiving a combination HRT (E + P). This decline was not observed in women on E only preparations (no effect). Also under the WHI umbrella, Shumaker et al.performed a long‐term double‐ blind RCT comparing CEE + MPA versus placebo in postmenopausal women ≥ 65‐year‐old (n = 4344). The placebo group was seen to perform significantly better on cognitive function testing than the treatment group at the end of the study period. These findings suggest that oestrogen has no protective effect on cognition in older postmenopausal women, and when used with a progestogen hastens cognitive decline.

However, Henderson et al.investigated the effect of HRT on cognition by age of treatment onset failed to show a correlation (n = 567). Women were split into two groups by date of last menstrual period (LMP): LMP < 6 years ago or LMP > 10 years ago. They were assigned to placebo or to treatment which consisted of oral 17β‐E2 with the addition of micronized progesterone vaginally for those with a uterus. With a mean duration of 2.5–5 years of treatment there were no observed differences in the cognitive performance of women with respect to time since menopause before instigation of HRT.

### Effects of conjugated equine estrogen in postmenopausal women with hysterectomy: the women's health initiative randomized controlled trial [^3625b4b2]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Despite decades of use and considerable research, the role of estrogen alone in preventing chronic diseases in postmenopausal women remains uncertain.

Objective

To assess the effects on major disease incidence rates of the most commonly used postmenopausal hormone therapy in the United States.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled disease prevention trial (the estrogen-alone component of the Women's Health Initiative [WHI]) conducted in 40 US clinical centers beginning in 1993. Enrolled were 10 739 postmenopausal women, aged 50–79 years, with prior hysterectomy, including 23% of minority race/ethnicity.

Intervention

Women were randomly assigned to receive either 0.625 mg/d of conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) or placebo.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was coronary heart disease (CHD) incidence (nonfatal myocardial infarction or CHD death). Invasive breast cancer incidence was the primary safety outcome. A global index of risks and benefits, including these primary outcomes plus stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), colorectal cancer, hip fracture, and deaths from other causes, was used for summarizing overall effects.

Results

In February 2004, after reviewing data through November 30, 2003, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) decided to end the intervention phase of the trial early. Estimated hazard ratios (HRs) (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for CEE vs placebo for the major clinical outcomes available through February 29, 2004 (average follow-up 6.8 years), were: CHD, 0.91 (0.75–1.12) with 376 cases; breast cancer, 0.77 (0.59–1.01) with 218 cases; stroke, 1.39 (1.10–1.77) with 276 cases; PE, 1.34 (0.87–2.06) with 85 cases; colorectal cancer, 1.08 (0.75–1.55) with 119 cases; and hip fracture, 0.61 (0.41–0.91) with 102 cases. Corresponding results for composite outcomes were: total cardiovascular disease, 1.12 (1.01–1.24); total cancer, 0.93 (0.81–1.07); total fractures, 0.70 (0.63–0.79); total mortality, 1.04 (0.88–1.22), and the global index, 1.01 (0.91–1.12). For the outcomes significantly affected by CEE, there was an absolute excess risk of 12 additional strokes per 10 000 person-years and an absolute risk reduction of 6 fewer hip fractures per 10 000 person-years. The estimated excess risk for all monitored events in the global index was a nonsignificant 2 events per 10 000 person-years.

Conclusions

The use of CEE increases the risk of stroke, decreases the risk of hip fracture, and does not affect CHD incidence in postmenopausal women with prior hysterectomy over an average of 6.8 years. A possible reduction in breast cancer risk requires further investigation. The burden of incident disease events was equivalent in the CEE and placebo groups, indicating no overall benefit. Thus, CEE should not be recommended for chronic disease prevention in postmenopausal women.

### Menopausal hormone therapy in a health maintenance organization before and after women's health initiative hormone trials termination [^aa7b2d9a]. Journal of Women's Health (2006). Low credibility.

Background

In July 2002, the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) published results that led to early termination of the randomized controlled trial of estrogen plus progestin in postmenopausal women with an intact uterus. Subsequently, the trial of estrogen only also was terminated early, and the results were published in April 2004. The present study examines the impact of both sets of results on menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) prescription patterns, as well as the characteristics of women who did and did not change their MHT behavior after publication of results.

Methods

We examined the number of MHT prescriptions filled in the months before and after each set of results was published, using claims data from 24,446 women aged 50–79 years continuously enrolled in a health maintenance organization (HMO) at Henry Ford Health System from January 2000 through December 2004.

Results

After July 2002, a statistically significant (p < 0.05) drop occurred in the rate of MHT prescriptions filled; 29% of the women stopped MHT for at least 4 months, but 24% of these women resumed use by December 2004. Successful stoppers tended to be older. Twenty-one percent of users in April 2004 stopped in May 2004 for at least 4 months; 25% of these had restarted by December. Women continued to initiate MHT after July 2002, but at lower rates in 2003 and 2004 (73% and 77% decreases, respectively, compared with 2001). The types of MHT prescriptions obtained by new users changed after 2001: fewer initiated MHT with oral Premarin (Wyeth, St. David's, PA) and Prempro or Premphase (Wyeth-Ayerst, Philadelphia, PA), and more initiated MHT with Premarin and Estrace (Warner Chilcott, Rockaway, NJ) creams.

Conclusions

Regardless of the goals of the WHI study, the publication of results on estrogen plus progestin in July 2002 impacted overall rates of MHT use, as did, to a lesser extent, the estrogen only results published in May 2004. Although women continued to initiate MHT after the results were published, they were less likely to use the formulations from the WHI and instead used formulations for which there is less information about effectiveness and long-term health consequences.

### Breast cancer risk in relation to the interval between menopause and starting hormone therapy [^f520433d]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2011). Low credibility.

There is extensive evidence that breast cancer incidence is increased in current users of menopausal hormone therapy and that the risk returns to that of never users of hormonal therapy soon after use ceases. Virtually all published reports that have compared the effects of different types of hormonal therapy found greater increases in breast cancer risk with use of estrogen–progestin than with use of estrogen-only formulations [see, which summarized results from 22 studies]. Results from some studies in the United States, including the Women's Health Initiative trial, found little or no increase in breast cancer risk with use of estrogen-only preparations. However, about 90% of the women in the estrogen-only arm of this trial were randomly assigned to hormonal therapy more than 5 years after their menopause, and the Women's Health Initiative investigators recently reported that breast cancer risk was greater if hormonal therapy use began less than 5 years after menopause than after a longer gap, both for estrogen-only and for estrogen–progestin preparations. We investigated whether breast cancer incidence varied by the timing of use of different types of hormonal therapy in a large prospective study in the United Kingdom.

### Menopause, reproductive life, hormone replacement therapy, and bone phenotype at age 60–64 years: a British birth cohort [^9e714465]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Hip fractures are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in older women, one of the main risk factors for which is low bone mineral density (BMD). Over the last 25 years, earlier timing of natural menopause has been related to lower BMD or subsequent fracture in a number of studies (for example, references). Some studies have investigated whether the length of reproductive life or oophorectomy and/or hysterectomy are associated with lower BMD or fracture, and the findings have been somewhat less consistent. In the UK Million Women Study, postmenopausal women had double the risk of hip fracture compared with premenopausal of the same age; however, in older women, current age had a much greater predictive value than age at menopause.

It is essential to take account of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) because patterns of use vary considerably by type and timing of menopause, and HRT is associated with bone health. The Women's Health Initiative trial demonstrated that estrogen plus progestin for healthy women with an intact uterus, and estrogen alone for those with a prior hysterectomy, increased areal BMD (aBMD) and reduced fracture risk. However, protection of aBMD and hip fracture starts soon after initiating HRT but does not continue after HRT ceases. In a study of monozygotic twins comparing pairs in which one twin took HRT and the other did not, HRT was associated with greater volumetric BMD (vBMD) and bone strength at both distal and diaphyseal bone sites.

### Changing concepts: menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer [^84a327d9]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2012). Low credibility.

Hormone therapy is still used by millions of women for menopausal symptoms. Concerns regarding hormone therapy and breast cancer were initially based on case reports and retrospective case-control studies. However, recent results from large prospective cohort studies and the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized placebo-controlled hormone therapy trials have substantially changed concepts regarding how estrogen alone and estrogen plus progestin influence breast cancer. The preponderance of observational studies suggested that estrogen alone and estrogen plus progestin both increased the risk of breast cancer, with cancers commonly diagnosed at an early stage. However, substantially different results emerged from the WHI randomized hormone therapy trials. In the WHI trial evaluating estrogen plus progestin in postmenopausal women with an intact uterus, combined hormone therapy statistically significantly increased the risk of breast cancer and hindered breast cancer detection, leading to delayed diagnosis and a statistically significant increase in breast cancer mortality. By contrast, estrogen alone use by postmenopausal women with prior hysterectomy in the WHI trial did not substantially interfere with breast cancer detection and statistically significantly decreased the risk of breast cancer. Differential mammography usage patterns may explain differences between observational study and randomized trial results. In clinical practice, hormone therapy users have mammograms more frequently than nonusers, leading to more and earlier stage cancer detection. By contrast, in the WHI randomized trials, mammogram frequency was protocol mandated and balanced between comparison groups. Currently, the different effects of estrogen plus progestin vs estrogen alone on breast cancer are not completely understood.

### Continuous combined estrogen plus progestin and endometrial cancer: the women's health initiative randomized trial [^ce0ecb3c]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2016). Low credibility.

Background

While progestin addition to estrogen mitigates endometrial cancer risk, the magnitude of the effect on incidence, specific endometrial cancer histologies, and endometrial cancer mortality remains unsettled. These issues were assessed by analyses after extended follow-up of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized clinical trial evaluating continuous combined estrogen plus progestin use.

Methods

The WHI enrolled 16 608 postmenopausal women into a randomly assigned, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Women age 50 to 79 years with intact uteri with normal endometrial biopsy at entry were randomly assigned to once-daily 0.625 mg conjugated equine estrogen plus 2.5mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (n = 8506) as a single pill or matching placebo (n = 8102). Follow-up beyond the original trial completion date required reconsent, obtained from 12 788 (83%) of surviving participants. Analyses were by intent-to-treat. All statistical tests were two-sided.

Results

After 5.6 years' median intervention and 13 years' median cumulative follow-up, there were fewer endometrial cancers in the combined hormone therapy compared with the placebo group (66 vs 95 case patients, yearly incidence, 0.06% vs 0.10%; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.48 to 0.89, P = 0.007). While there were somewhat fewer endometrial cancers during intervention (25 vs 30, respectively; HR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.45 to 1.31), the difference became statistically significant postintervention (41 vs 65, respectively; HR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.40 to 0.88, P = 0.008), but hazard ratios did not differ between phases (P difference = .46). There was a statistically nonsignificant reduction in deaths from endometrial cancer in the estrogen plus progestin group (5 vs 11 deaths, HR = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.15 to 1.22).

Conclusion

In postmenopausal women, continuous combined estrogen plus progestin decreases endometrial cancer incidence.

### Postmenopausal hormone therapy for cardiovascular health: the evolving data [^810196d5]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Postmenopausal (PM) hormone therapy (HT) was extremely popular for years as a treatment for many conditions, including cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD) prevention. The adverse results from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) ended the widespread prescriptive use of HT for nearly 20 years. The WHI findings have been broadly and unfairly applied to all hormone formulations, including modern treatments using human-identical hormones. Although CV health is indisputably linked to oestrogen status, HT involving any combination of hormones currently is not recommended for primary or secondary prevention of CVD. In the wake of more positive results from recent studies and re-evaluation of the WHI, HT has re-emerged as an issue for specialists in CVD to discuss with their patients. Rigorous scientific analysis is needed to explain the paradox of cardioprotection conferred by endogenous ovarian hormones with apparent cardiotoxicity inflicted by HT. This review will cover the origins of HT, hormone terminology and function, and key studies that contribute to our current understanding. Based on evolving evidence, if HT is to be used, we propose it be initiated immediately after cessation of ovarian hormone production and dosed as transdermal oestradiol combined with cyclic dosing of human-identical progesterone (P4).

### The timing hypothesis: hormone therapy for treating symptomatic women during menopause and its relationship to cardiovascular disease [^7396b6cb]. Journal of Women's Health (2019). Medium credibility.

The risks and benefits of menopausal hormonal therapy (HT) have been evaluated extensively over the past three decades. While the efficacy of HT for management of menopausal symptoms, including vasomotor symptoms and vaginal dryness is well established, its relationship to cardiovascular outcomes is complex. The timing hypothesis, which posits that the cardiovascular effects of HT depend on the timing of initiation of HT in relation to menopause, has helped shape our understanding of the cardiovascular outcomes related to HT. Based on results from female monkey studies, the timing hypothesis provides a framework to explain discrepancies in results between multiple observation studies and the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) hormone therapy trials. The WHI trials closed early in 2002 in part because of increased cardiovascular events seen in women on treatment. Subanalysis of the WHI results by age group, and more recent randomized control studies, including the Kronos Early Estrogen and Prevention Study (KEEPS) and Early Versus Late Intervention Trial (ELITE), demonstrate that the risk of adverse cardiovascular events for HT are low for women < 60 years of age or within 10 year from menopause. Although current data does not support using HT for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, it does suggest that HT can be safely used to treat symptoms in appropriately selected women close to menopause.

### Menopausal hormone therapy and dementia: nationwide, nested case-control study [^41e78809]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Dementia affects more women than men worldwide. Even when controlling for differences in survival rates, the incidence of dementia among women is higher compared with that of men, suggestive of risk factors related to the female sex.

Oestrogen is known to have both neuroprotective and neurodamaging properties. Exogenous systemic oestrogen is used in the management of menopausal vasomotor symptoms. The effect of menopausal hormone therapy on the risk of dementia is uncertain. Early meta-analyses found a protective effect of menopausal hormone therapy on the development of Alzheimer's disease, the most common cause of dementia. Later, in 2003, a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial, the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study, reported that menopausal hormone therapy was associated with an increased risk of dementia. However, the trial only included women who were 65 years or older. The contemporary standard recommendation for timing and duration of menopausal hormone therapy is use around the age of menopause, preferably for a maximum of five years. As such, the target population of hormone therapy around 50–55 years old and the findings from the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study less relevant in a real-world contemporary setting. Furthermore, the trial was not able to distinguish between different subtypes of dementia, and only conjugated oestrogens were examined, not oestradiol, which is the leading oestrogen contained in contemporary menopausal hormone therapy products. Following the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study, two small randomised controlled trials reported no association between oestrogen use and cognitive decline in postmenopausal women, however, the trial populations were highly selected.

### Improving cardiovascular clinical competencies for the menopausal transition: a focus on cardiometabolic health in midlife [^8c6555e7]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Menopause hormone therapy and cardiovascular health

The current understanding of MHT and its cardiovascular risks and benefits has evolved significantly over the past 2 decades. Table 2 highlights the most pertinent trials and their findings. Among the most seminal studies on this topic was the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) clinical trials, which were designed to evaluate the risks and benefits of systemic MHT for preventing chronic diseases, including CVD. The WHI enrolled women aged 50 to 79 years, with the average age of 63 years, more than a decade older than the average age of menopause in the United States (52 years). The WHI clinical trials were primarily designed to investigate the benefits and risks of specific hormonal therapies for chronic disease in postmenopausal women and therefore were not intended to determine if MHT reduced chronic disease in the younger, midlife woman. Unlike earlier observational studies suggesting cardioprotective benefits with MHT use, results from the WHI clinical trials do not support the use of MHT, specifically oral conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) alone or combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate for the prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, dementia, or other chronic diseases in postmenopausal women.
