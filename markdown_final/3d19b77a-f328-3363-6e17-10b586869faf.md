## Question

What is the antibiotic treatment for Moraxella and klebsiella pneumonia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about antibiotic treatment for Moraxella catarrhalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and likely syndromes where these pathogens are relevant. Then, I should verify the microbiology and resistance patterns that drive empiric choices. Next, I will stratify by setting and severity, including outpatient versus inpatient and ICU-level care. After that, I should outline empiric regimens and durations, followed by definitive therapy once cultures return. Finally, I will consider special populations, stewardship, and summarize practical recommendations with caveats about local resistance and patient-specific factors.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why these organisms matter. Moraxella catarrhalis is a common respiratory pathogen in community-acquired pneumonia, particularly in patients with chronic lung disease or older adults, and it frequently produces beta-lactamase, which constrains empiric choices. Klebsiella pneumoniae is a gram-negative bacillus that causes CAP, healthcare-associated pneumonia, and severe hospital-acquired pneumonia, with notable resistance risks including ESBL and carbapenemase production, so I need to ensure my empiric plan accounts for that spectrum and severity gradient [^115G3QT9] [^1179US5w].

> Wait, let me verify the resistance patterns before jumping to regimens. Moraxella catarrhalis routinely produces beta-lactamase, so amoxicillin monotherapy is unreliable; amoxicillin-clavulanate or a respiratory fluoroquinolone provides reliable activity, and I should avoid narrow-spectrum beta-lactams without beta-lactamase coverage when Moraxella is suspected [^117XZ7UZ] [^116wextN]. For Klebsiella pneumoniae, I need to check for ESBL risk and local prevalence; third-generation cephalosporins remain reasonable in many CAP settings, but ESBL risk pushes me toward piperacillin-tazobactam, a carbapenem, or ceftazidime-avibactam depending on severity and local epidemiology, so I should confirm local antibiograms before finalizing empiric choices.

> I will now examine outpatient CAP without severe comorbidities. For low-risk patients, I should confirm that narrow-spectrum options are acceptable. Amoxicillin 1 g three times daily is a first-line option for CAP, but hold on, I should verify Moraxella coverage; because Moraxella often produces beta-lactamase, amoxicillin-clavulanate is a safer empiric choice when Moraxella is plausible, whereas doxycycline or a macrolide are alternatives if beta-lactams are unsuitable, with macrolides reserved for low macrolide-resistance settings and recognizing they do not reliably cover Moraxella or Klebsiella [^113g1GAS] [^116R7qqa] [^117XZ7UZ]. If Klebsiella is a concern based on local epidemiology or prior cultures, I should broaden to amoxicillin-clavulanate or a respiratory fluoroquinolone to ensure gram-negative coverage, balancing risks and benefits [^116eNbdb].

> Next, I should review inpatient nonsevere CAP. The standard approach is a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone. Let me double-check that both regimens cover Moraxella and Klebsiella adequately. Amoxicillin-clavulanate or ceftriaxone paired with azithromycin covers Moraxella and typical gram-negatives including Klebsiella, while moxifloxacin or levofloxacin monotherapy also provides reliable activity against both pathogens, which aligns with ATS/IDSA guidance for nonsevere inpatients without MRSA or Pseudomonas risk [^117DLH1Y] [^116wextN] [^115G3QT9]. I should confirm duration; most CAP can be treated for 5 days if clinically stable, which supports stewardship without compromising outcomes [^112fdQqB].

> Hold on, I should verify severe CAP and ICU-level care. For severe CAP, combination therapy with a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or a beta-lactam plus a respiratory fluoroquinolone is recommended. I need to ensure gram-negative coverage is robust, and if Klebsiella with ESBL risk is suspected, I should escalate to piperacillin-tazobactam, a carbapenem, or ceftazidime-avibactam based on local resistance patterns and severity, with consideration of antipseudomonal coverage when risk factors are present [^112LnUKE]. Let me reconsider monotherapy; fluoroquinolone monotherapy is generally discouraged in severe CAP due to limited evidence, so I should avoid relying on moxifloxacin alone in ICU settings unless constrained by allergies or intolerance [^113vAAZT].

> I need to ensure I address HAP and VAP separately because the pathogen spectrum shifts. For hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia, empiric therapy should cover S. aureus, Pseudomonas, and other gram-negatives including Klebsiella; this typically means a beta-lactam with antipseudomonal activity plus a macrolide or fluoroquinolone, or combination therapy tailored to local epidemiology and patient risk factors, with de-escalation once cultures return [^116e7UWk] [^11411vru]. But wait, what if Klebsiella is carbapenem-resistant? In that scenario, I should confirm susceptibilities and consider agents like ceftazidime-avibactam or meropenem-vaborbactam per resistance guidance, underscoring the need for early culture acquisition and stewardship review [^116ocWjw].

> Next, I should review definitive therapy once cultures and susceptibilities return. If Moraxella is isolated and produced beta-lactamase, I should avoid amoxicillin monotherapy and continue with amoxicillin-clavulanate or a respiratory fluoroquinolone; if it is beta-lactamase negative, amoxicillin remains reasonable, though that scenario is uncommon for Moraxella [^117XZ7UZ] [^1142oEAv]. For Klebsiella, I should tailor to ESBL status; non-ESBL Klebsiella can often be treated with ceftriaxone or amoxicillin-clavulanate depending on site and severity, whereas ESBL producers warrant piperacillin-tazobactam, a carbapenem, or ceftazidime-avibactam, with attention to source control and clinical response [^116ocWjw] [^114HEyRk].

> Let me consider special populations and stewardship constraints. In pregnancy, I should avoid fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines, favoring beta-lactams with attention to Moraxella coverage; amoxicillin-clavulanate is reasonable when Moraxella is suspected, and ceftriaxone is appropriate for hospitalized patients [^notfound]. In pediatrics, CAP is often due to pneumococcus, H. influenzae, or Moraxella; amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate are first-line choices depending on local resistance and the likelihood of beta-lactamase producers, with duration minimized to the shortest effective course to reduce resistance pressure [^111kEy8f] [^117YDgXM]. I should double-check that my duration aligns with pediatric data; shorter effective courses are supported when the child is clinically improving [^117BHQyp].

> I should confirm the role of diagnostics and de-escalation. Obtaining sputum cultures before antibiotics when feasible, and using blood cultures in hospitalized patients, enables narrowing therapy; rapid molecular panels can expedite pathogen identification and resistance marker detection, though they should complement, not replace, clinical judgment and local epidemiology [^111vE2A6] [^111Znp7n]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; even with advanced diagnostics, empiric choices must still reflect severity, comorbidities, and local resistance patterns, with explicit plans to de-escalate or stop antibiotics if bacterial infection is excluded [^112dRMcG].

> Let me synthesize practical recommendations while keeping the caveats visible. For outpatient CAP with suspected Moraxella or Klebsiella, amoxicillin-clavulanate is a solid empiric choice that covers beta-lactamase–producing Moraxella and many Klebsiella; doxycycline is an alternative if beta-lactams are unsuitable, recognizing variable Klebsiella activity, and macrolides should be reserved for select scenarios with low resistance and when atypical coverage is prioritized [^117XZ7UZ] [^113g1GAS]. For inpatient nonsevere CAP, ceftriaxone plus azithromycin or moxifloxacin monotherapy are guideline-concordant and cover both pathogens; for severe CAP or ICU care, use a beta-lactam with reliable gram-negative activity plus a macrolide or a beta-lactam plus a respiratory fluoroquinolone, escalating to antipseudomonal and ESBL-active agents if risk factors or local data dictate, and target 5–7 days total therapy when clinically stable [^117DLH1Y] [^112LnUKE] [^112fdQqB]. For HAP/VAP, ensure antipseudomonal and MRSA coverage up front with combination therapy and de-escalate promptly based on cultures, and for confirmed ESBL Klebsiella, use piperacillin-tazobactam, a carbapenem, or ceftazidime-avibactam per susceptibilities and clinical response [^116e7UWk] [^116ocWjw].

> Finally, I need to ensure I have addressed the user's question directly and succinctly. Moraxella catarrhalis pneumonia is best treated with agents active against beta-lactamase producers such as amoxicillin-clavulanate or a respiratory fluoroquinolone, whereas Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia requires a beta-lactam with reliable gram-negative coverage, with escalation to piperacillin-tazobactam, a carbapenem, or ceftazidime-avibactam if ESBL or severe disease is suspected; in both cases, align the regimen with setting, severity, and local resistance, and aim for the shortest effective duration with early de-escalation when cultures allow [^117XZ7UZ] [^116wextN] [^116ocWjw] [^112fdQqB].

For Moraxella catarrhalis pneumonia, use **amoxicillin-clavulanate** or a **respiratory fluoroquinolone** (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) to cover beta-lactamase producers [^117XZ7UZ] [^116wextN]. For Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia, use a **third-generation cephalosporin** (ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) for non-ESBL strains; for ESBL-producing strains, use a carbapenem (meropenem or imipenem) or piperacillin-tazobactam [^116ocWjw] [^112Z6pNN]. In severe cases or when resistance is suspected, combine a beta-lactam with a fluoroquinolone or an aminoglycoside [^notfound]. Tailor therapy to **local resistance patterns** and **culture results**, and treat for 5–7 days if clinically stable [^112fdQqB].

## Clinical considerations and adjustments

- **Severity of illness**: Severe cases may require combination therapy (e.g. beta-lactam plus fluoroquinolone or aminoglycoside) [^notfound].
- **Local resistance patterns**: Adjust empiric therapy based on local antibiograms [^112dRMcG].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Consider allergies, renal function, and comorbidities when selecting antibiotics [^116eNbdb].
- **Duration of therapy**: Typically 5–7 days if the patient is clinically stable, with longer courses for severe or complicated cases [^112fdQqB].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Moraxella catarrhalis pneumonia**: Amoxicillin-clavulanate or respiratory fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) [^117XZ7UZ] [^116wextN].
- **Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia**: Third-generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) for non-ESBL strains; carbapenems (meropenem or imipenem) or piperacillin-tazobactam for ESBL-producing strains [^112Z6pNN] [^116ocWjw].
- **Severe infections**: Consider combination therapy and adjust based on culture and susceptibility results [^112LnUKE] [^112dRMcG].

---

Effective treatment of Moraxella catarrhalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia requires **pathogen-specific, severity-informed regimens** aligned with local resistance and patient factors, with therapy refined to culture results to optimize outcomes [^112DXJyG].

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guideline — scope and population focuses on management decisions from clinical diagnosis with radiographic confirmation through completion of antimicrobial therapy and follow-up chest imaging and does not address initial clinical diagnostic criteria or prevention. The guideline centers on patients in the United States without recent foreign travel and on adults without an immunocompromising condition, including those actively receiving cancer chemotherapy, patients infected with HIV with suppressed CD4 counts, and solid organ or bone marrow transplant recipients. Although CAP may be diagnosed without a chest radiograph in ambulatory settings, the guideline emphasizes studies using radiographic criteria given the known inaccuracy of clinical signs and symptoms alone. Empiric antibiotic recommendations are based on agents effective against major treatable bacterial causes, traditionally including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella species, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.

### Gemifloxacin mesylate (Factive) [^116XFW7k]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

FACTIVE is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the conditions listed below. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and CLINICAL STUDIES.)

Acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (ABECB) caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis.

Because fluoroquinolones, including FACTIVE, have been associated with serious adverse reactions (see WARNINGS) and for some patients ABECB is self-limiting, reserve FACTIVE for treatment of ABECB in patients who have no alternative treatment options.

Community-acquired pneumonia (of mild to moderate severity) caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multi-drug resistant strains [MDRSP])*, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, or Klebsiella pneumoniae.

*MDRSP: multi-drug resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, includes isolates previously known as PRSP (penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae), and are strains resistant to two or more of the following antibiotics: penicillin (MIC ≥ 2 μg/mL), 2nd generation cephalosporins (e.g., cefuroxime), macrolides, tetracyclines and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of FACTIVE and other antibacterial drugs, FACTIVE should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Clinical use of lefamulin: a first-in-class semisynthetic pleuromutilin antibiotic [^1164GxUw]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Lefamulin is a novel antibiotic agent within the pleuromutilin derivative class approved for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) by the United States Food and Drug Administration and the European Commission in 2019 and 2020, respectively. The objective of this article is to provide a summary of clinically relevant data underlying lefamulin and to provide recommendations for its place in therapy. In vitro data establish lefamulin's activity against a number of Gram-positive, Gram-negative and atypical organisms relevant in the treatment of CABP, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. Two phase-3 studies, the Lefamulin Evaluation Against Pneumonia trials, established non-inferiority of lefamulin against moxifloxacin in the treatment of CABP, including the sequential transition from intravenous to oral therapy and across a broad set of patient demographics and severities. Pooled and post hoc analyses have confirmed these effects for a variety of subgroups and secondary endpoints. Real-world study data post-approval have largely not yet emerged for lefamulin, and there is a need for further investigation into safety/efficacy for off-label indications such as acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections and sexually transmitted infections. Further data regarding tolerability, particularly with long-term use, as well as the emergence of resistance over time, are still undefined.

### Antibiotic courses for common infections… [^112fdQqB]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In patients with COPD exacerbations, antibiotic courses should be limited to five days.
- In patients with community-acquired pneumonia, the initial antibiotic course should be limited to five days with follow-up before completion of the course.
- For women with uncomplicated bacterial cystitis, taking nitrofurantoin for five days, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for three days, or a single dose of fosfomycin is effective. COPD Exacerbations In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations, antibiotic courses should be limited to five days. In patients with acute bronchitis, defined as respiratory symptoms with normal chest radiography, antibiotics are indicated only when the patient has COPD and is suspected to have a bacterial cause as indicated by increased sputum purulence and dyspnea or increased sputum volume.

In COPD exacerbations, oral treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanate, a macrolide, or a tetracycline has been proven effective and covers the likely pathogens. Uncomplicated Cystitis and Pyelonephritis In nonpregnant patients with uncomplicated bacterial cystitis, taking nitrofurantoin for five days, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for three days, or a single dose of fosfomycin should be considered; all three medications are similarly effective. These antibiotics are highly effective against. In patients with uncomplicated pyelonephritis, five- to seven-day courses of fluoroquinolones are recommended. Shorter courses of fluoroquinolones are as effective as longer courses in women and men with pyelonephritis, so a five-day course works as well as a 10-day course. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole should be avoided for empiric therapy in pyelonephritis because of resistance in nearly 20% of infections.

Cellulitis In nonpurulent cellulitis, antibiotic courses should be limited to five to six days of a cephalosporin, penicillin, or clindamycin. These antibiotics are effective against streptococci, and courses of five or six days are as effective as longer treatments.

### Managing community-acquired pneumonia: a European perspective [^112DfDgG]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disease and a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. It puts an enormous burden on medical and economic resources, particularly if hospitalization is required. Initial antibacterial therapy for CAP is usually empirical, as culture and antibacterial sensitivity test results are rarely available at initial diagnosis. Any agent selected for empirical therapy should have good activity against the pathogens commonly associated with CAP, a favorable tolerability profile, and be administered in a simple dosage regimen for good compliance. Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most common causative pathogen, although the incidence of this organism varies widely. Streptococcus pneumoniae strains with decreased susceptibility to penicillin have become increasingly prevalent over the past 30 years and are now a serious problem worldwide. In addition, an increase in the prevalence of pneumococci resistant to macrolides has been observed in Europe over recent years. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae are among the most common atypical pathogens isolated from patients with CAP. Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Moraxella catarrhalis are less commonly identified as causative organisms. The emergence and spread of resistance to commonly used antibiotics has challenged the management of CAP. Multiple sets of CAP guidelines have been published to address the continued changes in this complex disease.

### What is healthcare-associated pneumonia, and how should it be treated? [^1179US5w]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In contrast to patients at risk for hospital-acquired pneumonia or mechanically ventilated patients at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia, healthcare-associated pneumonia is a relatively new clinical entity that includes a spectrum of adult patients who have close association with acute care hospitals or reside in chronic care settings that increase their risk for pneumonia caused by multi-drug-resistant bacteria. Multi-drug-resistant pathogens include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacilli, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter species. New guidelines for the management and prevention of hospital-acquired pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia and healthcare-associated pneumonia from the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America were published in 2005 and are highlighted in this article.

Recent Findings

Recent data indicate that types of multi-drug-resistant pathogens may vary in different healthcare settings, and that individuals infected with multi-drug-resistant pathogens are more likely to receive inappropriate initial antibiotic therapy, which may result in poorer outcomes in terms of patient morbidity, mortality and increased length of hospital stay.

Summary

This review highlights key points in the new recommendations and principles for initiating, de-escalating and stopping antibiotic therapy in individuals with healthcare-associated pneumonia. Widespread implementation of these guidelines is needed in healthcare institutions in order to reduce patient morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.

### Antibiotics for COPD exacerbations: does drug or duration matter? A primary care database analysis [^116MfTZj]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are globally the most common infectious cause of morbidity. Despite this prevalence, observed duration of antibiotic treatment for LRTI varies greatly, and there is disagreement between guidelines on the optimal duration. Effective first-line treatment for non-pneumonic LRTI in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients ('infective exacerbations') is an area of particular uncertainty.

COPD is a common cause of disability, and estimated to become the third leading cause of death worldwide in 2030. Exacerbations form a large part of the disease burden and can lead to a cough with discoloured phlegm irrespective of causation. Over £250 million is spent on treating COPD exacerbations annually in the UK, and recurrent exacerbations are associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

Up to half of all COPD exacerbations are thought to be caused by bacteria, the remainder by viruses or environmental irritants. The most common pathogens are Haemophilus influenza e, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Initial studies suggested that the administration of antibiotics was associated with a lower risk of symptom persistence. However, a Cochrane review concluded that a statistically significant improvement in treatment failure rate was only seen in severe exacerbations, with more adverse events in the antibiotic group. Hence, the European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society and international guidelines advise, based on moderate evidence, the prescription of antibiotics for ambulatory patients 'if clinically indicated'. However, our understanding of the success of real-life prescribing practices is limited.

1.5 Acute Bacterial Sinusitis

Moxifloxacin Injection is indicated in adults (18 years of age or older) for the treatment of Acute Bacterial Sinusitis (ABS) caused by susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].

Because fluoroquinolones, including Moxifloxacin Injection, have been associated with serious adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 to 5.13)] and for some patients ABS is self-limiting, reserve Moxifloxacin Injection for treatment of ABS in patients who have no alternative treatment options.

1.6 Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis

Moxifloxacin Injection is indicated in adults (18 years of age or older) for the treatment of Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis (ABECB) caused by susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, or Moraxella catarrhalis [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Because fluoroquinolones, including Moxifloxacin Injection, have been associated with serious adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 to 5.13)] and for some patients ABECB is self-limiting, reserve Moxifloxacin Injection for treatment of ABECB in patients who have no alternative treatment options.

1.7 Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of moxifloxacin injection and other antibacterial drugs, moxifloxacin injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Culture and Susceptibility Testing

Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before treatment in order to isolate and identify organisms causing infection and to determine their susceptibility to moxifloxacin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)]. Therapy with moxifloxacin may be initiated before results of these tests are known; once results become available, appropriate therapy should be continued.

### No evidence of difference in mortality with amoxicillin versus co-amoxiclav for hospital treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^115u89gu]. The Journal of Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally, particularly affecting older and medically vulnerable people. In the United Kingdom (UK), annual CAP incidence ranges between 22–80/10,000 persons. A broad range of pathogens cause CAP, including bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and viruses such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and SARS-CoV-2.

Antibiotics and supportive care are the main treatments for bacterial CAP; most clinically treated cases do not have the causative pathogen identified, so most treatment is empirical. In the UK and Northern Europe, where most S. pneumoniae remain penicillin susceptible, narrow-spectrum beta-lactam treatment principally targeting S. pneumoniae, e.g. oral penicillin or ampicillin/amoxicillin, is often effective. However, concerns about other pathogens such as K. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae and S. aureus, which may not respond to such treatment, can lead to use of broader-spectrum beta-lactams, with macrolides/doxycycline also added to cover 'atypical' infections such as Mycoplasma.

Current guidelines recommend amoxicillin for low/moderate-severity CAP, ± a macrolide if atypical infection is suspected in moderate-severity cases, and co-amoxiclav + a macrolide for high-severity CAP. Broader-spectrum antibiotics are recommended for severe disease, to ensure less common, but more resistant, pathogens are treated, given the greater potential for adverse outcomes. However, concern about resistance and prior community treatment with narrow-spectrum antibiotics, can lead to use of co-amoxiclav and other broad-spectrum beta-lactams in non-severe CAP presenting to hospital. Use and over-use of broad-spectrum antibiotics contributes to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), more side effects, and increased Clostridioides difficile infections. Understanding when narrower-spectrum antibiotics can safely be used could help mitigate AMR development.

While population-based studies and clinical trials have examined the effectiveness of different antibiotic treatments for CAP, none have directly compared the treatment outcomes between amoxicillin and co-amoxiclav, the two most commonly used antibiotics for CAP in the UK. We used electronic healthcare records (EHR) from a large UK teaching hospital group to investigate clinical outcomes in patients with CAP treated with either amoxicillin or co-amoxiclav, to understand if narrow-spectrum antibiotics could be safely used more widely.

### The international scientific association of probiotics and prebiotics (ISAPP) consensus statement on the definition and scope of postbiotics [^111ZkL34]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Table 1
Past proposed definitions of the term 'postbiotics'

Many existing postbiotics include inanimate strains belonging to established probiotic taxa within some genera of the family Lactobacillaceae (now comprising 31 genera) or the genus Bifidobacterium –. However, a microbial strain or consortium does not have to qualify as a probiotic (while living) for the inactivated version to be accepted as a postbiotic. Specific strains of Akkermansia muciniphila, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Bacteroides xylanisolvens, Bacteroides uniformis, Eubacterium hallii, Clostridium cluster IV and XIVa, Apilactobacillus kunkeei and the fungus Saccharomyces boulardii have all been investigated for potential beneficial effects in an inanimate form and would fit the definition of postbiotic should a health benefit be demonstrated –. Many bacterial lysates have been used for medical purposes, but there is a clear need for more robust clinical trials. For example, a report by the(EMA) describes the assessment of eight different lysates developed for respiratory conditions. The report provides a review of the results of clinical studies, data on adverse effects reported with these medicines, and advice from an expert group on infectious diseases and considers the benefit–risk balance of bacterial lysate-based products. Based on this review, EMA recommended that bacterial lysate medicines authorized for respiratory conditions should only be used for the prevention of recurrent respiratory infections and not for treatment or pneumonia. The companies must also provide further data on safety and effectiveness from new clinical studies by 2026. A commercial oral postbiotic developed to protect against a variety of respiratory pathogens through boosting immune function illustrates the possible microbiological complexity of postbiotic design. For this preparation, 21 different bacterial strains are grown in individual batches, heat-inactivated once they reach a critical mass, harvested, and then subjected to alkaline lysis and further purification steps. The microbiological composition includes one strain of Haemophilus influenzae, four strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, two strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, one strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae, two strains of Staphylococcus aureus, one strain of Streptococcus pyogenes, three strains of Streptococcus sanguinis and three strains of Moraxella catarrhalis. Bacterial lysates have further been shown to exert anti-infection effectsand, indeed, efficacy in reducing the frequency of acute respiratory infections among those prone to recurrent respiratory infections has been demonstrated in clinical trials. In addition, polyvalent bacterial lysates derived from the mechanical lysis of strains commonly involved in respiratory infections such as otitis media, pharyngitis, sinusitis and sometimes pneumonia induced the maturation of dendritic cells, recruit B and T lymphocytes, increase the number of circulating natural killer cells in treated patients when compared with age-matched controlsand induced the secretion of specific IgA – in a group of ten healthy volunteers, suggesting some potential in the treatment of chronic pulmonary conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Unfortunately, a large randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial with the related lysate in 288 patients (142 in the placebo group and 146 in the treatment group) failed to meet its primary end point — a reduction in exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Also, some spirulina formulations could qualify as postbiotics, but only if the processing and microorganism used (often species Arthrospira platensis) is well described and the health benefit well documented in robust clinical trials.

### Evaluation of semi-quantitative compared to quantitative cultures of tracheal aspirates for the yield of culturable respiratory pathogens-a cross-sectional study [^113rfCp1]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are a cause of increased morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. It is one of the leading infective causes of intensive care units (ICU) admissions. Its diagnosis is based on the presence of clinical findings along with radiological and microbiological findings. Types of respiratory samples recommended for culture include sputum, endotracheal suction aspirates (ETSA), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), protected brush specimens (PBS). Post-physiotherapy ETSA is a much easier sample to collect in intubated patients compared to an invasive BAL sample. These can be obtained simply and cost effectively with less side-effects as compared to BAL and PBS. Thus the commonest respiratory sample from intubated patients with suspected pneumonia or lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) sent for microbiological analysis is ETSA. For a proper microbiological diagnosis, a true representative sample is necessary as the respiratory tract, endotracheal tubes and tracheostomies are commonly colonized with normal flora. Usual cultivable pathogens causing LRTI are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients with CAP while Acinetobacter species, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and K. pneumoniae are more prevalent in HAP. Recent guidelines published by the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) in 2016 recommend use of noninvasive semi-quantitative cultures in these patients. However, the international European Respiratory Society (ERS), European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) and the Latin American Thoracic Association (ALAT) guidelines for the management of hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia recommend obtaining distal quantitative samples (prior to any antibiotic treatment) in order to reduce antibiotic exposure in stable patients with suspected ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) and to improve the accuracy of the results; and a lower respiratory tract sample (distal quantitative including BAL and PSB or proximal quantitative or qualitative culture including ETSA) to focus and narrow the initial empiric antibiotic therapy. There have been multiple studies comparing the results of quantitative BAL cultures with ETSA cultures with similar results. Very few studies compare quantitative and semi-quantitative processing of ETSA cultures for pathogen yield. We hypothesized that the performance of ETSA culture using quantitative or semi-quantitative technique for LRTI diagnosis is similar.

The clinical success rate in the evaluable population at the primary efficacy assessment, 3–5 days after the end of study treatment, was 93.9% in patients treated with 200 mg moxifloxacin; 94.4%, with 400 mg moxifloxacin; and 94.3%, with clarithromycin. Clinical success rates were maintained at follow-up, 21–28 days after the end of treatment: 90.7% (200 mg moxifloxacin), 92.8% (400 mg moxifloxacin) and 92.2% (clarithromycin). The 95% confidence intervals indicated that all three treatment regimens were equally effective in treating CAP. At follow-up, the 400 mg moxifloxacin dose had a slightly higher observed cure rate than the 200 mg moxifloxacin dose, but this was not statistically significant. The most frequently isolated pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (42%), Haemophilus influenzae (19%), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (10%), Moraxella catarrhalis (6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5%) and Staphylococcus aureus (4%). The bacteriological success rate (eradication and presumed eradication) was 72.5% (29/40) for 200 mg moxifloxacin, 78.7% (37/47) for 400 mg moxifloxacin and 70.7% (29/41) for clarithromycin. The adverse event profile was comparable between the three treatment groups. Most adverse events, possibly or probably related to the study drug, were generally mild or moderate in severity and mostly related to the digestive system: diarrhoea, nausea and abdominal pain in 200 mg moxifloxacin patients; diarrhoea, liver function abnormalities and nausea in 400 mg moxifloxacin patients and liver function abnormalities, diarrhoea, nausea and taste perversion in clarithromycin patients. Study drugs were discontinued because of adverse events in 7/229 (3%) patients treated with 200 mg moxifloxacin, 11/224 (5%) with moxifloxacin 400 mg and 11/222 (5%) with clarithromycin. In all assessments, moxifloxacin was at least as effective clinically, and as well tolerated as clarithromycin in the treatment of CAP. Bacteriological success rates in moxifloxacin-treated patients were greater than those of clarithromycin. Moxifloxacin, given once daily, is free of many drug-drug interactions and requires no dosage adjustments in most renal hepatic deficient patients.

### Telithromycin (Ketek) [^116Vgw1F]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

KETEK tablets are indicated for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (of mild to moderate severity) due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, (including multi-drug resistant isolates [MDRSP]), Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, or Mycoplasma pneumoniae, for patients 18 years old and above.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of KETEK and other antibacterial drugs, KETEK should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Moxifloxacin hydrochloride [^111sxGtG]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Acute Bacterial Sinusitis

In a controlled double-blind study conducted in the U.S., moxifloxacin tablets (400 mg once daily for ten days) were compared with cefuroxime axetil (250 mg twice daily for ten days) for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis. The trial included 457 patients valid for the efficacy analysis. Clinical success (cure plus improvement) at the 7 to 21 day post-therapy test of cure visit was 90% for moxifloxacin hydrochloride and 89% for cefuroxime.

An additional non-comparative study was conducted to gather bacteriological data and to evaluate microbiological eradication in adult patients treated with moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily for seven days. All patients (n = 336) underwent antral puncture in this study. Clinical success rates and eradication/presumed eradication rates at the 21 to 37 day follow-up visit were 97% (29 out of 30) for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 83% (15 out of 18) for Moraxella catarrhalis, and 80% (24 out of 30) for Haemophilus influenzae.

14.2 Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis

Moxifloxacin tablets (400 mg once daily for five days) were evaluated for the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis in a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial conducted in the U.S. This study compared moxifloxacin hydrochloride with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily for 10 days) and enrolled 629 patients. Clinical success was assessed at 7 to 17 days post-therapy. The clinical success for moxifloxacin hydrochloride was 89% (222/250) compared to 89% (224/251) for clarithromycin.

The microbiological eradication rates (eradication plus presumed eradication) in moxifloxacin hydrochloride treated patients were Streptococcus pneumoniae 100%, Haemophilus influenzae 89%, Haemophilus parainfluenzae 100%, Moraxella catarrhalis 85%, Staphylococcus aureus 94%, and Klebsiella pneumoniae 85%.

### Primary care implications of the British thoracic society guidelines for bronchiectasis in adults 2019 [^112du84Z]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Long-term antibiotic therapy

Long-term — 3 months or more — antibiotic therapy should be considered for patients with three or more exacerbations per year, which should be initiated and monitored by specialist teams in secondary care. Treatment with oral azithromycin, 250 mg, three times weekly for a year can reduce the incidence of exacerbations in patients with bronchiectasis, and this is recommended as a pragmatic starting dose in the guidelines. In patients with concurrent P. aeruginosa infection, the recommended first-line therapy is inhaled colistin. Sputum samples from a secondary care population show that H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa are the most common bacterial isolates with other pathogens, such as M. catarrhalis, S. pneumoniae and non-tuberculous mycobacteria also being found. The presence of P. aeruginosa not only guides the choice of antibiotic therapy, but also signifies a worse prognosis with a threefold risk in mortality, higher risk of hospital admission and poorer quality of life.

### Antibiotic treatment in acute exacerbation of COPD: patient outcomes with amoxicillin vs. amoxicillin / clavulanic acid-data from 43, 636 outpatients [^113ZAecG]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute exacerbations (AECOPD) of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) contribute to high morbidity and mortality. Key symptoms are breathlessness, increased sputum volume and purulence. The treatment involves the use of bronchodilators, oxygen treatment, systemic corticosteroids and often antibiotics. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections, shorten the course of the disease, prevent further deterioration of lung function, and prolong the period between exacerbations. A quick recovery and longer interval between hospitalizations are important, as both the patient's life and healthcare costs are influenced by the severity and the number of AECOPD. The largest and most recent meta-analysis on treatment of AECOPD concludes in line with earlier meta-analyses, that for serious exacerbations (requiring hospital admission) there is moderate evidence that antibiotic treatment improves outcomes compared to placebo. For mild to moderate cases (outpatients), the conclusion is less clear, although it is observed, that the risk of treatment failure, defined as no resolution or deterioration of symptoms, is higher among patients who do not receive antibiotics. No effect was found regarding all-cause mortality or re-exacerbations within 2 to 6 weeks. The conclusion was based on pooled data from studies with different antibiotics, and where various doses were used. When using antibiotics, GOLD recommends that the choice is based on local resistance patterns. Today amoxicillin (AMX) 750 mg three times daily (TID) is recommended as first choice empirical treatment of AECOPD in Denmark in mild to moderate cases, however many clinicians prefer amoxicillin with clavulanic acid (AMC) 500/125 mg TID, as recommended in the previous guideline, referring to the fact that AMC is effective against Moraxella catarrhalis. A bacterial pathogen is believed to be accountable for around half of the deteriorations, where Haemophilus influenzae are most commonly found, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis. AMX has a narrow spectrum of activity compared to AMC. Apart from Staphylococcus aureus and M. catarrhalis, most pathogens that cause community acquired pneumonia and AECOPD that are sensitive to AMC are also sensitive to AMX. The use of AMX instead of AMC in exacerbations in patients with severe COPD has not yet been investigated in a sufficiently large patient population and with clinically important endpoints like pneumonia hospitalization and death. The aim of this study was to determine which of these regimens is associated with better outcomes. On one hand, AMC has a broader spectrum of activity, and on the other hand, AMX is most often administered at a higher dose of amoxicillin (750 mg vs. 500 mg), which may increase the time above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for many pathogenic bacteria. Additionally, side effects may be more frequent when using AMC. The main analysis compares the risk of death or hospitalization due to pneumonia or AECOPD in the 30 days following a first AMX/AMC prescription.

### Comparison of ceftriaxone plus macrolide and ampicillin / sulbactam plus macrolide in treatment for patients with community-acquired pneumonia without risk factors for aspiration: an open-label, quasi-randomized, controlled trial [^113zaTNU]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pneumonia is caused by a wide variety of pathogens, and is one of the most common infections around the world. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is caused by bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis or viruses such as influenza virus. Susceptibility to antibiotics varies depending on the pathogen. For example, the susceptibilities of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus to β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors were reported as 99.5%, 59.3–78.0% and 7.7–20.2%, and the susceptibilities of these species to third-generation cephalosporins were reported as 96.8, 100 and 1.0%. Antibiotics were therefore selected on the basis of presumptive bacteria in consideration of the patient's age, comorbidities, symptoms, laboratory findings, severity, and so on.

Ceftriaxone (CTRX) and ampicillin/sulbactam (ABPC/SBT) are recommended by various guidelines for pneumonia in a number of countries as the first-line antibiotics for CAP. Both of these antibiotics are active against a similar range of microorganisms, except for anaerobic bacteria, which are the predominant pathogens in aspiration pneumonia. Because the susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to CTRX is relatively low, some guidelines recommend ABPC/SBT for the treatment of aspiration pneumonia. In previous reports that did not consider aspiration risks, no significant differences were found between CTRX and β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations such as ABPC/SBT for the treatment of pneumonia. Only one paper has compared ABPC/SBT with CTRX in the treatment of aspiration pneumonia patients. However, that study was a retrospective propensity score-matching analysis and whether this result is applicable to aspiration pneumonia in clinical practice remains unclear.

Some reports have described CAP excluding aspiration pneumonia, but most previous studies of antibiotic treatments for CAP have included patients with aspiration pneumonia. To our knowledge, no reports have compared CTRX and ABPC/SBT for the treatment of CAP in patients without risk factors for aspiration. We therefore carried out the present study with the aim of investigating whether CTRX might be more effective than ABPC/SBT for the treatment of CAP, after excluding cases of aspiration pneumonia.

### Moxifloxacin monotherapy versus combination therapy in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia evoked ARDS [^113vAAZT]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening disease evoked by a variety of precipitants, including community acquired pneumonia (CAP) with a current mortality of about 40%. Severe CAP is the most frequent cause of ARDS and acknowledged recommendations for antimicrobial therapy are provided in Germany by the S3-guidelines and in the United States by the Consensus guidelines on the management of CAP in adults. Along these recommendations, a combination of a broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotic (e.g. cefotaxim, ceftriaxone, piperacillin/tazobactam, ertapenem, or meropenem) in combination with a macrolide or fluoroquinolone is usually administered empirically to patients with severe CAP and septic disease progression or mechanically ventilated patients. Fluoroquinolone monotherapy (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) is reserved for patients without severe disease progression. However, the recommendations to limit moxifloxacin monotherapy to patients with lesser CAP severity is supported only by evidence grade II A and is due to the lack of efficacy data on fluoroquinolones as monotherapy for the treatment of severe CAP. Although, one study reported that an antibiotic combination therapy improved survival among critically ill patients with bacteriaemic pneumococcal illness compared to those treated with beta-lactam monotherapy. Third generation fluoroquinolones were either not used for monotherapy in this study or further studies dedicated to this issue did not exist at that time. However, several studies have suggested sufficient efficacy of fluoroquinolones monotherapy in CAP in the absence of septic disease progression or mechanical ventilation.

Specifically, moxifloxacin has a broad spectrum of activity against almost all microorganisms isolated from CAP patients and its activity is not opposed by relevant antimicrobial resistance, including multi-resistant pneumococci and pathogens such as Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae. Those can carry resistance to penicillins, macrolides, and tetracyclines. Moxifloxacin also possesses the best activity against other pathogens such as Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumonia) and is therefore the first choice antibiotic for such infections. Meta-analysis data suggests that moxifloxacin alone has a higher pathogen eradication rate than a β-lactam-based combination therapy. Accordingly, moxifloxacin may be sufficient even when used as a monotherapy in severe CAP. Nevertheless, studies addressing the effectiveness of moxifloxacin monotherapy in severe CAP evoked ARDS are lacking.

Accordingly, we assessed the hypothesis that moxifloxacin monotherapy is equally effective as a guideline recommended combination therapy in ARDS patients due to severe CAP.

### HIRA-TAN: a real-time PCR-based system for the rapid identification of causative agents in pneumonia [^111Znp7n]. Respiratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Identification of the causative pathogen(s) of pneumonia would allow the selection of effective antibiotics and thus reduce the mortality rate and the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens. To identify such pathogens and to obtain these benefits, it is necessary that a clinical test is rapid, accurate, easily performed, and cost-effective. Here, we devised a PCR-based test, named HIRA-TAN, which is able to discriminate therapeutic targets from commensal organisms (e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae) and to detect foreign organisms (e.g. Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Legionella pneumophila) in the sputum. The utility of this system was validated in a prospective study, using sputum samples from patients with pneumonia. 568 patients were enrolled and the HIRA-TAN assay identified the causative pathogens with an accuracy of 96.7% for H. influenzae; 93.2% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 80.6% for Klebsiella pneumoniae; 90.9% for Moraxella catarrhalis; 87.5% for Escherichia coli; 78.1% for MRSA and 91.6% for S. pneumoniae. Overall the HIRA-TAN procedure was able to identify the causative pathogens of pneumonia in 60% of the cases. Additionally, this procedure was able to determine when the pneumonia-causing organism was a commensal organism or a foreign organism in a single assay. The HIRA-TAN approach yielded reproducible results and provided valuable information to plan the course of treatment of pneumonia. Through the rapid identification of the causative pathogens, the HIRA-TAN will promote targeted treatments for pneumonias.

### Efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin in community acquired pneumonia: a prospective, multicenter, observational study (CAPRIVI) [^117E3agJ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the most common infectious diseases worldwide. Reported incidences of CAP in different countries range from 1.6 to 11 per 1000 adults, although precise estimates are difficult to establish, in part because no universal definition exists for diagnosing CAP.

CAP is a major cause of morbidity, hospitalization, mortality, and impaired quality of life, and associated with substantial societal health care burden. In Western European countries, the rate of hospitalization of patients with CAP varies between approximately 10%–60%, depending largely on the patient group under investigation. Mortality rates of CAP range from < 5% in outpatients to 10% in ward patients, and exceed 30% in patients in intensive care, illustrating the broad spectrum of severity of the disease. Incidences of CAP and CAP-related mortality increase sharply with age, and are appreciably higher in men than women.

The main causative pathogens in CAP are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, which together account for approximately 85% of cases. Additional "atypical" pathogens in CAP include Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila. Many CAP patients have mixed infections including both typical and atypical pathogens.

Instant diagnosis of the causative organism would be optimal for managing CAP; however, the responsible pathogen is usually not known at the time of CAP diagnosis and no pathogen is identified in up to 50% of patients even after extensive testing for several days. Since rapid initiation of antibiotic treatment of CAP is mandatory, an empirical antibiotic therapy is required taking into consideration the spectrum of efficacy of available agents and local evidence on antimicrobial resistance. Guidelines on empirical treatment from the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) recommend an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone (e.g. moxifloxacin or levofloxacin) or a combination of β-lactam and macrolide for CAP patients hospitalized on a general ward. The guidelines of the European Respiratory Society also recommend moxifloxacin or levofloxacin as a treatment option for empirical therapy for hospitalized CAP patients with or without the need of intensive care.

### Appropriate use of antibiotics for respiratory infections: review of recent statements and position papers [^114Zrbnc]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Respiratory infections are among the most common reasons for prescribing antibiotics. The excessive use of antibiotics in ambulatory practice has contributed to the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance. The appropriate use of antimicrobial agents for respiratory infections could potentially reduce the emergence of antibiotic resistance. This article reviews recent guidelines and position papers on the appropriate antibiotic treatment for respiratory infections. There is a wide consensus that antibiotics are not appropriate for the treatment of most cases of acute bronchitis, pharyngitis, and rhinosinusitis. The recently published community-acquired pneumonia guidelines emphasized the importance of selecting antibiotic regimens active against both typical and atypical pathogens. However, there is disagreement regarding the routine use of the new quinolones.

### Review of treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia [^111wTGxs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a costly disease that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The growing prevalence of this disease has resulted in various advances in diagnosis and treatment. The most common pathogens of CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and atypical pathogens; however, the underlying pathogen often is unknown. Treatment of CAP has evolved because of changing etiologic patterns and increasing antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens. Among the groups that have established treatment guidelines for CAP are the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These guidelines establish risk factors associated with drug resistance or infection with specific pathogens. In addition, each guideline provides unique recommendations that are similar in some ways, yet different in others. By understanding the various risk factors for drug resistance and the treatment options endorsed by these guidelines, physicians can treat patients with the most appropriate antimicrobial available.

### Cefpodoxime proxetil [^111DMmcU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Cefpodoxime proxetil is indicated for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the conditions listed below.

Recommended dosages, durations of therapy, and applicable patient populations vary among these infections. Please see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for specific recommendations. Acute otitis media caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (excluding penicillin-resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase-producing strains), or Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (including beta-lactamase producing strains).

Pharyngitis and/or tonsillitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes.

NOTE: Only penicillin by the intramuscular route of administration has been shown to be effective in the prophylaxis of rheumatic fever. Cefpodoxime proxetil is generally effective in the eradication of streptococci from the oropharynx. However, data establishing the efficacy of cefpodoxime proxetil for the prophylaxis of subsequent rheumatic fever are not available.

### Review of antibacterial drugs for treatment of infections… [^112Jk4GW]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Vancomycin may be required for highly resistant strains. In ambulatory patients, an oral macrolide, doxycycline or a fluoroquinolone such as levofloxacin is recommended. Hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia, often caused by gram-negative bacilli such as. Klebsiella, should be initially treated with a third-generation cephalosporin, cefepime, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid or imipenem — with or without an aminoglycoside. In the intensive care unit, where Pseudomonas aeruginosa is common, imipenem or meropenem plus an aminoglycoside would be a good first choice of therapy. Meningitis. The organisms most commonly responsible for bacterial meningitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. In adults and children older than two months, cefotaxime or ceftriaxone is recommended, plus vancomycin to cover resistant pneumococci.

Vancomycin and rifampin are stopped if the organism is found to be susceptible to cephalosporins. In patients who are allergic to penicillin, vancomycin can be used for treatment of resistant pneumococci. In children, administration of dexamethasone before or at the same time as the first dose of antibiotics to decrease the incidence of hearing loss and neurologic complications remains a matter of controversy. If methicillin-resistant staphylococci are suspected, vancomycin is often recommended. If anaerobes are suspected in intra-abdominal or pelvic infections, treatment with ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin-sulbactam, or cefoxitin or cefotetan, each with or without an aminoglycoside, is recommended. Urinary Tract Infection. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections can be effectively treated with oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or fluoroquinolone. A three-day course is usually sufficient.

For repeated infections, a fluoroquinolone, oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid or an oral third-generation cephalosporin can be effective. Hospitalized patients may need an aminoglycoside in addition to the standard regimens.

### Addition of macrolide antibiotics for hospital treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^1174pxsj]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics are the main treatment for bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In the United Kingdom (UK), guidelines from the British Thoracic Society and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommend amoxicillin for the empirical treatment of low- to moderate-severity pneumonia, and co-amoxiclav for high-severity pneumonia. For moderate- and high-severity pneumonia, these guidelines suggest combining macrolide antibiotics with amoxicillin or co-amoxiclav to provide coverage for atypical pathogens such as Mycoplasma. Similarly, European and Latin American guidelines also recommend the addition of macrolides to β-lactams as empirical antibiotic therapy in hospitalized patients with severe CAP, while United States (US) guidelines recommend including atypical cover (which can be with a β-lactam + macrolide or respiratory fluroquinolone monotherapy) for all patients hospitalized with CAP.

Macrolides have also been hypothesized to improve outcomes from pneumococcal pneumonia, even when an active β-lactam is given, by means other than their antimicrobial activity (eg, anti-inflammatory effects). However, macrolide use is associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events, adverse gastrointestinal events, and resistance against multiple antibiotics at both a population level and within individuals.

Existing population-based studies and clinical trials have yielded contradictory evidence.

Several retrospective and small prospective studies have suggested that dual therapy (β-lactam plus macrolide) is associated with lower mortality in patients with severe CAP. However, these findings have been challenged by other observational studies that reported no significant differences in outcomes, such as mortality and length of hospital stay, between monotherapy and combination therapy. Two meta-analyses of observational studies reported that macrolide use was associated with a significant reduction in mortality. In contrast, a noninferiority trial in non–intensive care unit (ICU) CAP patients found that monotherapy was noninferior to combination therapy in terms of 90-day mortality. Another noninferiority trial recruiting patients with moderately severe CAP reported delayed clinical stability with monotherapy but found no differences in mortality or length of stay. A recent randomized trial suggested that adding macrolides to β-lactam therapy improved clinical response and reduced the inflammatory burden, although mortality remained similar between groups.

Given these conflicting results, large observational studies may help by comparing treatment options in real-world representative populations. We therefore examined the effect of adjunctive macrolides on clinical outcomes in adults hospitalized for CAP receiving β-lactam therapy, using electronic healthcare records from a large UK teaching hospital group, extending the approach used in our recent analysis of the impact of β-lactam choice in CAP.

### Treatment of acute otitis media consensus recommendations [^111a7pz8]. Clinical Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this paper is to provide consensus recommendations for the management of acute otitis media (AOM) that pediatricians can incorporate into their daily practices. These recommendations were developed during a roundtable meeting that convened clinicians versed in the management of AOM. This meeting was sponsored by an educational grant from SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals. In addition, clinical studies on AOM identified via MEDLINE search were considered in the development of these recommendations. The Drug-Resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae Therapeutic Working Group guidelines for the management of AOM are reviewed in detail. All of the articles identified from the data sources were evaluated and all information deemed relevant was included in this review. AOM is one of the most common infectious diseases affecting infants and children and one of the leading causes of office visits and antibiotic prescriptions for this population. The incidence of AOM has increased during the past 25 years, probably the result of an increased utilization of day care facilities in the United States. The predominant pathogens in AOM include S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. The high prevalence of drug-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-producing organisms presents a clinical challenge for practitioners in the selection of empiric antimicrobial therapy. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles should be considered in addition to minimum inhibitory concentrations in selecting antibiotics for AOM. Amoxicillin at conventional or high doses (80–90 mg/kg/day) remains an appropriate choice for first-line therapy for AOM. For patients in whom amoxicillin is unsuccessful, second-line therapy should have demonstrated activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae as well as beta-lactamase-producing pathogens. Appropriate options for second-line therapy include high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (90 mg/kg/day based on the amoxicillin component) and ceftriaxone. Cefuroxime has been suggested as a second-line agent in the past, but recent surveillance data suggest it may no longer be active against penicillin-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae. Tympanocentesis is useful for identifying the causative pathogen, and it may be beneficial for patients who have failed multiple courses of antibiotics. The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine recently was approved for use in children and should be administered to all children less than 2 years old and those at risk for recurrent AOM (e.g., day care attendance, siblings with a history of recurrent AOM). Consensus recommendations are provided for the management of AOM, with a focus on antimicrobial therapy. The current challenges in the management of AOM include the need for an increased understanding of epidemiology, increasing resistance among common middle ear pathogens, use of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles in designing treatment strategies, and understanding the potential impact of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.

### Addition of macrolide antibiotics for hospital treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^112hPViU]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Between 1 January 2016 and 19 March 2024, 8872 patients admitted with a primary pneumonia diagnostic code received baseline amoxicillin or co-amoxiclav (within −12 to +24 hours of admission) and were included in the analyses (Table 1). Among 3239 (36.5%) and 5633 (63.5%) admissions receiving baseline amoxicillin or co-amoxiclav, 606 (18.7%) and 1821 (32.3%) received additional macrolide antibiotics, respectively. The median age was 78.5 (interquartile range [IQR], 65.3–87.1) years, and 4621 (52.1%) were male. Other baseline characteristics (Table 1), comorbidities (Supplementary Table 2), and covariates (Supplementary Table 3) showed moderate differences by initial treatment received, as expected given guidelines.

Table 1.
Baseline Characteristics and Clinical Outcomes by Initial Antibiotics Received

Among 8872 admissions, 5267 (59.4%) had blood cultures performed; 216 (2.4%) had a positive blood culture with a pneumonia-associated pathogen. A total of 1320 (14.9%) were tested with influenza/respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) polymerase chain reaction (PCR); 64 (0.7%) had influenza and 49 (0.6%) had RSV detected. Three hundred eighty-eight (4.4%) patients (predominantly immunosuppressed) were tested with a multiplex respiratory PCR, and 22 patients (0.2%) had Mycoplasma detected. A total of 1019 (11.5%) received a Legionella urinary antigen test, with only 2 positive results. In patients with positive blood cultures, the most common pathogen identified was Streptococcus pneumoniae (141 admissions [1.6% of all admissions]), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (22 [0.2%]), Klebsiella pneumoniae (17 [0.2%]), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12 [0.1%]), and Haemophilus influenzae (10 [0.1%]). One hundred thirty-five of 141 (95.7%) S pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to penicillin, and 2 of 141 (1.4%) were resistant. Penicillin susceptibility results for S aureus were not routinely reported for blood culture isolates (historically < 5% of isolates were susceptible). Five of 10 (50%) H influenzae isolates were ampicillin resistant.

### Activity of oral β-lactam antimicrobial agents versus respiratory tract isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis in the era of antibiotic resistance [^114hPot1]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

The management of outpatient respiratory tract infections with oral beta-lactam antimicrobial agents has been complicated by the emergence of beta-lactamase-producing strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis and isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae that express varying levels of beta-lactam resistance because of altered penicillin-binding proteins. There is no question that all 3 of these important respiratory tract pathogens have changed conspicuously in the context of decreased activity of beta-lactam antimicrobial agents. The question arises, what does this change mean from a clinical perspective? In this review, the in vitro activity of various oral beta-lactam antimicrobial agents versus contemporary isolates of H influenzae, M catarrhalis, and S pneumoniae will be compared. The approach that is used in defining organisms as being susceptible or resistant to beta-lactam antimicrobial agents will be elucidated. Finally, an effort will be made to assess the ramifications of beta-lactam resistance for therapeutic efficacy in patients with respiratory tract infections caused by these 3 bacteria. We conclude that, notwithstanding diminished beta-lactam activity for many clinical isolates of H influenzae, M catarrhalis, and S pneumoniae, certain agents remain effective in treating outpatient respiratory tract infections.

Cephalosporins

Ceftaroline

Ceftaroline is a fifth-generation cephalosporin and is approved for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections (ABSSSI) (with additional approval for S. aureus bacteremia associated with ABSSSI) and community-acquired pneumonia. Ceftaroline exhibits activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) through binding penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a), but also against many gram-positive and -negative pathogens [Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS), Klebsiella spp, E. coli], with the exception of non-fermentative (P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii) and multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli [extended spectrum β -lactamase (ESBL) or Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) producing isolates]. Ceftaroline is used at a standard intravenous dose of 600 mg every 12 h if creatinine clearance is > 50 ml/min and the dose may be increased to 600 mg every 8 h in the case of complicated skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) caused by S. aureus with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) 2 or 4 mg/l to ceftaroline. Dosage adjustment is required for altered kidney function with creatinine clearance ≤ 50 ml/min. Ceftaroline is well tolerated, and its most common adverse reactions are gastrointestinal (diarrhea, nausea), headache, pruritus and Clostridium difficile infection, even though there are some post-market reports of myelotoxicity related to prolonged (> 7 days) ceftaroline exposure.

### Antimicrobial therapy of community-acquired pneumonia [^111TaSjW]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disorder that is potentially life-threatening, especially in older adults and patients with comorbid disease. Despite substantial progress in therapeutic options, CAP remains a primary cause of death from infectious disease in the United States. The mainstay of treatment for most patients is appropriate antimicrobial therapy This article reviews the principles for initial antimicrobial therapy, highlights some of the differences in approaches to antimicrobial drug selection in selected guidelines, and includes new recommendations for empiric and pathogen-directed therapy of CAP.

### Best practices in the development and use of experimental models of bacterial pneumonia: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^115KP4pH]. American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology (2025). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society workshop on experimental models of bacterial pneumonia — scope and key focuses are as follows: the report summarizes an American Thoracic Society workshop on animal models of bacterial pneumonia and includes review of non-animal complementary or alternative models for studying bacterial pneumonia, with emphasis on bacterial pathogens that frequently cause community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia and key aspects in modeling infection. Preclinical models are described as of utmost importance to decipher pathogenesis and develop novel targets for intervention and treatment, and animal models offer the powerful ability to investigate different pneumonia types at varying stages of infection and disease, although the same models can promote important variations in outcome that potentially confound scientific understanding. Animal models discussed included small and large animals based on their strengths, and the ethical considerations in the use of animal modeling for the study of bacterial lung infections was discussed; this workshop report is intended to provide insights to investigators and may serve as a starting point for formal recommendations in the future. The overview underscores that bacterial pneumonia remains a major global health issue and highlights the value of animal and non-animal models for studying key pathogens like Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae; keywords include bacterial infection, lungs, experimental models, animals, and ethical considerations.

### Microorganisms resistant to conventional antimicrobials in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115YeS8s]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) negatively affect hospitalisation, readmission, disease progression and mortality rates in patients with COPD. Severe AECOPD are mainly triggered by bacterial infection, viral infection or environmental agents, with the most common causes of bacterial infection being Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Thus, current recommendations for antimicrobial treatment are aminopenicillin with or without clavulanic acid, a macrolide or a tetracycline. AECOPD are infrequently caused by microorganisms — such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia or enterobacteria — that are resistant to these treatments. Guidelines and previous studies of severe AECOPD suggest that these patients have increased frequencies of exacerbations, previous antibiotic use, previous hospital admissions and more severe airflow limitations.

At least 30% of COPD patients are colonised by a potential pathogen when in a stable phase of their disease; however only 0.5% are colonised by Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa or S. maltophilia. Also, AECOPD are associated with the overgrowth of potential pathogens and with the occurrence of P. aeruginosa in the lower airway. Knowing the risk factors to microorganisms resistant to conventional antibiotic treatment (MRCT) in AECOPD could lead to improved prophylaxis and empirical antimicrobial treatment.

We hypothesised that specific factors predict the presence of MRCT. Our primary aim was to identify the risk factors associated with infection by MRCT. Our secondary aim was to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with AECOPD resulting from MRCT against those with AECOPD from other causes.

### Antimicrobial resistance in major pathogens of hospital-acquired pneumonia in Asian countries [^114fiiSW]. American Journal of Infection Control (2008). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial resistance is a worldwide problem. For patients with hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia, resistant pathogens pose a significant challenge to successful treatment outcomes and to the cost-effective delivery of health care. In the developing world, antibiotic resistance may be relatively more prevalent compared with Western countries. Common resistant pathogens include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, multidrug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, multidrug resistant Acinetobacter species, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The emergence of these strains has provided a major impetus toward development of the present consensus treatment recommendations of the Asian HAP Working Group. The following review provides summary data regarding the incidence and prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in 10 Asian countries.

### Managing acute lower respiratory tract infections in an era of antibacterial resistance [^114JKRVP]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Respiratory tract infections account for more than 116 million office visits and an estimated 3 million visits to hospital EDs annually. Patients presenting at EDs with symptoms suggestive of lower respiratory tract infections of suspected bacterial etiology are often severely ill, thus requiring a rapid presumptive diagnosis and empiric antimicrobial treatment. Traditionally, clinicians have relied on beta-lactam or macrolide antibiotics to manage community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections. However, the emerging resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae to beta-lactams and/or macrolides may affect the clinical efficacy of these agents. Inappropriate use of antibiotics and use of agents with an overly broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity have contributed to the emergence of antibiotic resistance. When treating respiratory infections, clinicians need to prescribe antimicrobial agents only for those individuals with infections of suspected bacterial etiology; to select agents with a targeted spectrum of activity that ensures coverage against typical S pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis strains, including antibiotic-resistant strains and atypical pathogens; and to consider agents with specific chemical properties that limit the development of antimicrobial resistance and that achieve concentrations at sites of infection that exceed those required for bactericidal activity. Newer classes of antimicrobial agents, such as the oxazolidinones and ketolides, will likely play a significant role in this era of antimicrobial resistance.

### Nursing home-acquired pneumonia [^1137T3Nf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Pneumonia is the most serious of the common infections that occur in nursing homes, with a high case-fatality rate and considerable mortality among survivors. Risk factors for nursing home-acquired pneumonia (NHAP) have been defined, and prediction models for death due to NHAP have been developed. The bacterial etiology of NHAP has been debated, but "typical" bacterial pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis) are most important. Clinical presentation of NHAP is said to be "atypical", but this may be confounded by dementia in the nursing home resident. A recent guideline has made recommendations regarding the minimal diagnostic workup when a resident has a suspected case of pneumonia. Until recently, most guidelines for the treatment of pneumonia did not specifically address NHAP; there is some evidence that use of a quinolone alone may be an acceptable first choice of therapy for most cases. Pneumococcal and influenza vaccination have been the primary prevention measures. However, additional methods to prevent NHAP should be evaluated, including improving the oral hygiene of residents and instituting pharmacological interventions.

### Diagnosis and treatment of upper respiratory tract infections in the primary care setting [^116Gwx1k]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Acute respiratory tract infections such as acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB), acute otitis media (AOM), and acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) account for approximately 75% of antibiotic prescriptions written and are among the leading reasons for physician office visits in the United States. Resistance of the predominant pathogens in respiratory tract infections (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis) to available antibiotics has led clinicians to reevaluate the diagnosis and management of these infections.

Objective

The purpose of this review is to provide primary care practitioners with an accessible combined resource for the management of AECB, AOM, and ABRS.

Methods

This review was based on discussions from a roundtable meeting (sponsored by an educational grant from GlaxoSmithKline) that convened clinicians versed in the management of upper and lower respiratory tract infections. In addition, primary articles were identified by a MEDLINE search and through secondary sources.

Results

To reduce the prevalence of resistance, judicious and appropriate use of antibiotics must be implemented in clinical practice. With accurate diagnosis of bacterial and nonbacterial conditions, and patient education on antibiotic use and misuse, the excessive use of antibiotics and ensuing resistance can be reduced. The incorporation of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data with minimum inhibitory concentration values can provide a more comprehensive assessment of antibiotic activity in vivo. Stratification of patients with AECB according to patient characteristics and frequency of exacerbation can be used to determine which patients will benefit from antibiotic treatment and to guide clinicians in their choice of antibiotic. The Drug-Resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae Therapeutic Working Group has issued recommendations on the management of AOM based on prior antibiotic therapy, which is a risk factor for antimicrobial resistance. The Sinus and Allergy Health Partnership guidelines for the treatment of ABRS in adults and children are based on the predicted efficacy of various antibiotics as well as patient age, severity of disease, likelihood of bacterial infection, likelihood of spontaneous resolution, and in vitro susceptibility of the predominant pathogens based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic breakpoints.

Conclusions

Guidelines for the management of AECB, AOM, and ABRS emphasize the importance of differentiating between bacterial and nonbacterial infections, choosing an antibiotic based on the likelihood of infection with resistant pathogens, and providing coverage against the predominant pathogens. The judicious use of antibiotics also has been identified as an instrumental part of controlling unnecessary antibiotic use and subsequent resistance.

### Gram-negative bacterial resistance: evolving patterns and treatment paradigms [^1176c291]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Successful treatment of patients with nosocomial pneumonia depends primarily on providing adequate initial antibiotic treatment in a timely manner, because an inappropriate course is closely associated with increased mortality. Gram-negative bacteria are commonly responsible for nosocomial pneumonia, and the increasing prevalence of drug resistance among these bacteria complicates decision making with regard to treatment with antibiotics. Infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa are particularly problematic because of their intrinsic resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics and their ability to acquire adaptive resistance during a therapeutic course. Numerous strategies, including the use of combination therapy followed by de-escalation of antibiotics, have shown promise in the treatment of these serious infections. However, future success in treating nosocomial infections depends on the appropriate and responsible use of antibiotics in the intensive care unit, to ensure that the antibiotics available today maintain their effectiveness in the future.

Rates and patterns of antibiotic resistance differ between countries, regions, and hospitals, and high levels of resistance have been observed across all main strains of pathogens. For example, the SENTRY study reported reduced susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to most antimicrobials tested, including ceftazidime (79.6/68.7% susceptibility in USA/Europe), meropenem (76.3/65.8%), and piperacillin/tazobactam (72.9/63.9%). Furthermore, Klebsiella spp. showed extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) phenotype prevalences of 19.5% and 35.1% in the USA and Europe, respectively; meropenem was active against 62.3% and 78.7% of ESBL Klebsiella spp. These concerning levels of beta-lactam resistance in Gram-negative pathogens are reflected in a recent comprehensive report issued by the World Health Organization (WHO), which included data from 129 WHO member states on nine bacteria–antibacterial drug combinations; the report included global resistance data on a number of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens that are commonly involved in pneumonia (Table 1). WHO member states reported high rates of beta-lactam resistance, including resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems in K. pneumoniae. In addition to these resistance mechanisms, new mechanisms — e.g. New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamases (NDM-1 and NDM-4) — are emerging. Given the global increase in antibiotic resistance rates and the striking variation between regions, it is clearly important that treatment guidelines be adopted on the basis of local surveillance and epidemiology data, be validated, and be applied with consideration for new antimicrobial drugs.

### Azithromycin (Zmax) [^117WJs9q]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Zmax is indicated for the treatment with mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible isolates of the designated microorganisms in the specific conditions listed below. [See CLINICAL STUDIES (14)]

Acute bacterial sinusitis in adults due to Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis or Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Community-acquired pneumonia in adults and pediatric patients six months of age or older due to Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Streptococcus pneumoniae, in patients appropriate for oral therapy. Pediatric use in this indication is based on extrapolation of adult efficacy. [See USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.4)]

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Zmax and other antibacterial drugs, Zmax should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before treatment to determine the causative organism and its susceptibility to Zmax. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)] Therapy with Zmax may be initiated before results of these tests are known; once the results become available, antimicrobial therapy should be adjusted accordingly.

Zmax is a macrolide antimicrobial indicated for mild to moderate infections caused by designated, susceptible bacteria:

Acute bacterial sinusitis in adults (1)

### The diagnosis and treatment of elderly patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic bronchitis [^112Bv8zM]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2010). Low credibility.

The syndrome of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) consists of chronic bronchitis (CB), bronchiectasis, emphysema, and reversible airway disease that combine uniquely in an individual patient. Older patients are at risk for COPD and its components — emphysema, CB, and bronchiectasis. Bacterial and viral infections play a role in acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) and in acute exacerbations of CB (AECB) without features of COPD. Older patients are at risk for resistant bacterial organisms during their episodes of AECOPD and AECB. Organisms include the more-common bacteria implicated in AECOPD/AECB such as Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Less-common nonenteric, gram-negative organisms including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, gram-positive organisms including Staphylococcus aureus, and strains of nontuberculosis Mycobacteria are more often seen in AECOPD/AECB episodes involving elderly patients with frequent episodes of CB or those with bronchiectasis. Risk-stratified antibiotic treatment guidelines appear useful for purulent episodes of AECOPD and episodes of AECB. These guidelines have not been prospectively validated for the general population and especially not for the elderly population. Using a risk-stratification approach for elderly patients, first-line antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin, ampicillin, pivampicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and doxycycline), with a more-limited spectrum of antibacterial coverage, are used in patients who are likely to have a low probability of resistant organisms during AECOPD/AECB. Second-line antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, second- or third-generation cephalosporins, and respiratory fluoroquinolones) with a broader spectrum of coverage are reserved for patients with significant risk factors for resistant organisms and those who have failed initial antibiotic treatment.

### Variation in target attainment of beta-lactam antibiotic dosing between international pediatric formularies [^1143RH2t]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

In a 2020 report on child mortality led by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO), infectious diseases were found to be the leading cause of death in children under the age of 5 years and are estimated to cause over half of deaths in this age group. Bacterial infections, increasingly involving multidrug resistant organisms, are responsible for a significant proportion of these deaths, with pneumonia accounting for 15%, sepsis 7%, and meningitis 2%, respectively. In many cases these infectious diseases are preventable and need to be targeted by both policies aimed at prevention and also optimal treatment.

One barrier to optimal treatment is the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), particularly among gram‐negative organisms. Over the last 20 years in Malawi, bloodstream isolates have changed from mainly sensitive to mainly resistant to first‐line antibiotics (gentamicin, ampicillin, and cefotaxime), with resistance in Klebsiella species now over 90%. This concerning trend is seen throughout other low‐income and middle‐income countries, and may mean that previous gains in reductions in mortality may be impacted by infections caused by multidrug resistant organisms. In an effort to reduce the spread of AMR, the WHO has categorized the Essential Medicines List (EML) agents into "Access", "Watch", and "Reserve" (AWaRe) antibiotics, to manage global antibiotic usage. This seeks to limit the use of "Watch" and "Reserve" agents where possible. In vitro there is evidence to suggest that low antibiotic exposure can select for or induce resistance, whereas when concentrations are higher resistance is less likely to appear. While clinical dosing guidelines should primarily recommend "Access" and "Watch" agents, a key aspect of preserving their efficacy is therefore to ensure dosing is optimized.

### Treatment of acute exacerbation of severe-to-very severe COPD with azithromycin in patients vaccinated against Streptococcus pneumoniae [^116BMvFs]. Respiratory Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Sixty-five consecutive eligible adult patients, who were treated as outpatients for stable severe-to-very severe COPD, were enrolled in the study. All of them received 23-valent pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide vaccine intramuscularly. Patients were seen monthly, as well as whenever they had symptoms suggestive of an exacerbation, at our outpatient clinic. Eighteen out of 65 patients suffered from acute exacerbation (AECOPD). Three of these patients presented two episodes of AECOPD. Patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD received azithromycin 500 mg/day once daily for 3 days and a short course of oral prednisolone 25 mg/die. In 16 cases, a single species was isolated, while in the remaining 5 cases at least two species were recovered. Clinical cure or improvement at the end of therapy (3–5 days post-therapy) was reported in 17 episodes of AECOPD with no relapse at the late post-therapy (10–14 days after the completion of treatment). Bacteriologic eradication or presumptive eradication rates at the end of therapy were 86% (24 out of 28 isolates). Azithromycin eradicated all isolates of Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, H. parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella spp. isolated at baseline. Eradication of Sta aureus occurred in 1 of 3 isolates whereas azithromycin was unable to eradicate Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. Our data seem to indicate that pneumococcal vaccination reduces the possibility that an AECOPD is caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. This finding allows the use of antibiotics such as azithromycin, which, otherwise, should be avoided because of resistances.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116eNbdb]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Outpatient CAP with comorbidities — broader-spectrum regimens and fluoroquinolone considerations: Patients with comorbidities should receive broader-spectrum treatment, with regimens recommended that include a β-lactam or cephalosporin in combination with either a macrolide or doxycycline; these combinations should effectively treat macrolide- and doxycycline-resistant S. pneumoniae, β-lactamase–producing strains of H. influenzae, many enteric gram-negative bacilli, most methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, and M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae. Despite increasing reports of adverse events related to fluoroquinolone use, the panel believed that fluoroquinolone therapy was justified for adults with comorbidities and CAP managed in the outpatient setting. The guideline adopts the convention to recommend that patients with recent exposure to one antibiotic class receive treatment with a different class, and notes that both sets of treatment recommendations contain multiple antibiotic options without specifying a preference order, requiring a risk–benefit assessment that weighs local epidemiology and individual risk factors such as documented β-lactam or macrolide allergy, cardiac arrhythmia (macrolides), vascular disease (fluoroquinolones), and history of infection with Clostridium difficile.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for treatment of acute respiratory tract infections in adults: background, specific aims, and methods [^111wvbPt]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The need to decrease excess antibiotic use in ambulatory practice has been fueled by the epidemic increase in antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The majority of antibiotics prescribed to adults in ambulatory practice in the United States are for acute sinusitis, acute pharyngitis, acute bronchitis, and nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections (including the common cold). For each of these conditions — especially colds, nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections, and acute bronchitis (for which routine antibiotic treatment is not recommended) — a large proportion of the antibiotics prescribed are unlikely to provide clinical benefit to patients. Because decreasing community use of antibiotics is an important strategy for combating the increase in community-acquired antibiotic-resistant infections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention convened a panel of physicians representing the disciplines of internal medicine, family medicine, emergency medicine, and infectious diseases to develop a series of "Principles of Appropriate Antibiotic Use for Treatment of Acute Respiratory Tract Infections in Adults". These principles provide evidence-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment of adults with acute respiratory illnesses. This paper describes the background and specific aims of and methods used to develop these principles. The goal of the principles is to provide clinicians with practical strategies for limiting antibiotic use to the patients who are most likely to benefit from it. These principles should be used in conjunction with effective patient educational campaigns and enhancements to the health care delivery system that facilitate nonantibiotic treatment of the conditions in question.

### Antibiotic retreatment for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116ZrQip]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Studies that have examined the symptomatic resolution of exacerbations with validated patient-reported outcome tools have shown that the median time to symptomatic resolution ranges from 9 to 16.5 days. However, there is considerable variation around this time frame, and some patients who are destined to recover have not yet reached their baseline level of symptoms 14 days after the initial onset of their exacerbation. These slow resolvers appear to be a significant proportion of the patients included in this study, as evidenced by the fact that the median time to full resolution of symptoms following randomization to retreatment was only 3 days in those treated with antibiotics and 4 days in the group treated with placebo. If these patients were indeed experiencing a persistent or superimposed bacterial infection, spontaneous resolution in 3 to 4 days would be highly unusual.

Understanding the value of an antibiotic treatment is enhanced by corresponding bacteriological data. If exacerbations are suspected to be bacterial, sputum yields potential pathogens in about half the instances. If bacterial persistence or superinfection are mechanisms of exacerbation nonresolution, then antibiotic resistant bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Moraxella catarrhalis should be prevalent. In fact, the recognition of M. catarrhalis as an important cause of COPD exacerbations came from several reports of patients failing treatment with a β-lactam antibiotic who were infected with a β-lactamase–producing strain of this pathogen. In this study, only 32% of patients could provide a sputum sample for bacteriology and only 15% of randomized patients had sputum that yielded a positive bacterial culture. This is not surprising given that most patients had very mild symptoms and did not display clinical characteristics suggesting they had a bacterial infection.

### Quantitative analysis of pathogens in the lower respiratory tract of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112cXiUZ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

In this present study, we describe the application of RT-qPCR in tageting specific bacterial pathogen genes for the simultaneous and direct detection and quantification of a range of the most common pathogens in the lower respiratory tract including Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonos aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzeae, and Moraxella catarrhalis in PSB and BALF samples obtained from stable COPD and AECOPD patients. Moreover, we explored the relationship among bacterial burden, inflammtory response such as neurotophil count and cytokine levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8 in BALF, and the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) % predicted, forced vital capacity (FVC) % predicted, and FEV1/FVC lung function values in COPD patients. Our study is the first to describe common bacteria in the lower respiratory tract by RT-qPCR analysis using PSB and protected BALF samples, and compare the change of bacterial load between the stable stage and acute exacerbations of COPD. These results may provide guidance for the effective and timely antibiotic treatment of AECOPD patients.

### Recommendations for antibacterial therapy in adults with COVID-19-an evidence based guideline [^115L1gPn]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Scope

The Dutch Working Party on Antibiotic Policy constituted a multidisciplinary expert committee to provide evidence-based recommendation for the use of antibacterial therapy in hospitalized adults with a respiratory infection and suspected or proven 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Methods

We performed a literature search to answer four key questions. The committee graded the evidence and developed recommendations by using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology.

Questions Addressed By The Guideline and Recommendations

We assessed evidence on the risk of bacterial infections in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the associated bacterial pathogens, how to diagnose bacterial infections and how to treat bacterial infections. Bacterial co-infection upon admission was reported in 3.5% of COVID-19 patients, while bacterial secondary infections during hospitalization occurred up to 15%. No or very low quality evidence was found to answer the other key clinical questions. Although the evidence base on bacterial infections in COVID-19 is currently limited, available evidence supports restrictive antibiotic use from an antibiotic stewardship perspective, especially upon admission. To support restrictive antibiotic use, maximum efforts should be undertaken to obtain sputum and blood culture samples as well as pneumococcal urinary antigen testing. We suggest to stop antibiotics in patients who started antibiotic treatment upon admission when representative cultures as well as urinary antigen tests show no signs of involvement of bacterial pathogens after 48 hours. For patients with secondary bacterial respiratory infection we recommend to follow other guideline recommendations on antibacterial treatment for patients with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia. An antibiotic treatment duration of five days in patients with COVID-19 and suspected bacterial respiratory infection is recommended upon improvement of signs, symptoms and inflammatory markers. Larger, prospective studies about the epidemiology of bacterial infections in COVID-19 are urgently needed to confirm our conclusions and ultimately prevent unnecessary antibiotic use during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116R7qqa]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Outpatient community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) without comorbidities — initial antibiotic choices and macrolide use: For patients without comorbidities, the panel recommended amoxicillin 1 g every 8 hours or doxycycline 100 mg twice daily; some experts recommend that the first dose of oral doxycycline be 200 mg. In a departure from prior CAP guidelines, the panel did not give a strong recommendation for routine use of a macrolide antibiotic as monotherapy for outpatient CAP, citing a macrolide resistance rate of > 30% among S. pneumoniae isolates in the United States; however, in settings where macrolide resistance is documented to be low and there are contraindications to alternative therapies, a macrolide as monotherapy is a treatment option.

### Determinants of empirical antipseudomonal antibiotic prescription for adults with pneumonia in the emergency department [^117LvPfo]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic regimens and microbiology

For initial treatment in the ED, 305 (55.6%) patients were prescribed one antibiotic and 244 (44.4%) were prescribed a combination regimen. Eighty-five percent of prescriptions complied with the SEPAR guidelines (for the purpose of study, β-APS use was considered non-concordant). Empirical antimicrobial regimens are summarized in Table 2. The most frequently prescribed antibiotics in monotherapy were levofloxacin in 129 (42.3%) and amoxicillin-clavulanate in 108 (35.4%). Ceftriaxone plus azithromycin (in 190, 34.2%) was the most common combination. In 78 patients (14%) antipseudomonal β-lactam (β-APS) was prescribed in monotherapy or in combination. The empirical use of β-APS differed between groups and was significantly more frequent in ICP and HCAP (CAP, 6.4%; ICP, 26.4%; HCAP, 19.4%; p < 0.001).

Table 2
Description of initial antibiotic therapy for 549 inpatients

β-APS Antipseudomonal β-lactam

We collected blood cultures in 340 episodes, and 145 valid respiratory specimens were retrieved. An etiological diagnosis was made in 184 patients (33.5%): 50 (40%) in the ICP group, 103 (35%) in the CAP group and 31 (24%) in the HCAP group (p = 0.02). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated pathogen (124/549, 22.6%): the pneumococcal urine antigen test was positive in 111/389 (28.5%) of patients evaluated. Other microorganisms had a lower frequency: Haemophilus influenzae 16 (2.9%), Moraxella catarrhalis 11 (2%) and Enterobacteriaceae 10 (1.8%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in 9/549 (1.6%): three cases in the CAP group, two in the ICP group and four in the HCAP group. Moderate-severe COPD was present in five and nine patients respectively and a previous isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was documented in two of them. Bacteremia occurred in only one patient, with chronic dialysis.

The distribution of microorganisms across the groups is shown in Fig. 1.

### Clinical outcomes associated with amoxicillin treatment for acute otitis media in children [^113nNwhr]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common reason children are prescribed antibiotics. Bacteria that produce beta-lactamase are an increasingly frequent cause of AOM and may be resistant to amoxicillin, the currently recommended treatment for AOM. We aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of children treated with amoxicillin for AOM and assessed whether outcomes vary by infecting pathogen or beta-lactamase production.

Methods

205 children 6–35 months old diagnosed with AOM and prescribed amoxicillin were included. Bacterial culture and qualitative multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction were performed on nasopharyngeal swabs collected at enrollment. Parents completed surveys assessing symptoms, antibiotic adherence, and potential adverse events. The primary outcome was treatment failure with amoxicillin. Secondary outcomes included recurrence, symptom improvement, resolution, and adverse drug events (ADE).

Results

8 children (5.4%) experienced treatment failure and 14 (6.8%) had recurrence. By day 5, 152 (74.1%) children had symptom improvement and 97 (47.3%) had resolution. Parents reported ADE for 56 (27.3%) children. Among 149 children who did not take any amoxicillin before enrollment, 98 (65.8%) had one or more beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. Common bacterial otopathogens were Moraxella catarrhalis (79, 53.0%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (51, 34.2%), Haemophilus influenzae (30, 20.1%), and Staphylococcus aureus (21, 14.1%). Treatment failure did not differ between children that did (5, 5.1%) and did not (3, 5.9%) have beta-lactamase-producing otopathogens (p = .05).

Conclusions

Among children diagnosed with AOM treated with amoxicillin, treatment failure was uncommon and did not differ by pathogen or beta-lactamase production. These data support guidance recommending amoxicillin despite an increasing prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.

### Extended versus standard antibiotic course duration in children [^117BHQyp]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

High-level evidence is limited for antibiotic duration in children hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) from First Nations and other at-risk populations of chronic respiratory disorders. As part of a larger study, we determined whether an extended antibiotic course is superior to a standard course for achieving clinical cure at 4 weeks in children 3 months to ≤ 5 years old hospitalized with CAP.

Methods

In our multinational (Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia), double-blind, superiority randomized controlled trial, children hospitalized with uncomplicated, radiographic-confirmed, CAP received 1–3 days of intravenous antibiotics followed by 3 days of oral amoxicillin-clavulanate (80mg/kg, amoxicillin component, divided twice daily) and then randomized to extended (13–14 days duration) or standard (5–6 days) antibiotics. The primary outcome was clinical cure (complete resolution of respiratory symptoms/signs) 4 weeks postenrollment. Secondary outcomes included adverse events, nasopharyngeal bacterial pathogens and antimicrobial resistance at 4 weeks.

Results

Of 372 children enrolled, 324 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were randomized. Using intention-to-treat analysis, between-group clinical cure rates were similar (extended course: n = 127/163, 77.9%; standard course: n = 131/161, 81.3%; relative risk = 0.96, 95% confidence interval = 0.86–1.07). There were no significant between-group differences for adverse events (extended course: n = 43/163, 26.4%; standard course, n = 32/161, 19.9%) or nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus or antimicrobial resistance.

Conclusions

Among children hospitalized with pneumonia and at-risk of chronic respiratory illnesses, an extended antibiotic course was not superior to a standard course at achieving clinical cure at 4 weeks. Additional research will identify if an extended course provides longer-term benefits.

### Microbiology and preclinical review of omadacycline [^1149StMC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Gram-positive Aerobes

Omadacycline has potent in vitro activity against gram-positive aerobes, including antimicrobial-resistant pathogens such as MRSA (MIC 90 0.25 μg/mL) and penicillin- or macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae (MIC 90 0.12 μg/mL; Table 1; breakpoints available from the US Food and Drug Administration [FDA]). Omadacycline MIC values have been determined to be comparable for healthcare- and community-associated MRSA. Omadacycline is also active against VRE, with an MIC 90 of 0.25 μg/mL for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and of 0.12 μg/mL for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. It also retains activity against tetracycline-resistant gram-positive bacteria, including S. aureus (MIC 90 0.5 μg/mL), E. faecalis (MIC 90 0.25 μg/mL), E. faecium (MIC 90 0.12 μg/mL), S. pneumoniae (MIC 90 0.12 μg/mL), and β-hemolytic streptococci (MIC 90 0.25 μg/mL; Table 1).

Table 1.
In Vitro Activity of Omadacycline and Comparators Against Select Gram-positive Aerobes

Gram-negative Aerobes

Omadacycline has in vitro activity against species of Enterobacteriaceae, including Escherichia coli (MIC 90 2 μg/mL), Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC 90 8 μg/mL), Klebsiella oxytoca (MIC 90 2 μg/mL), Citrobacter spp. (MIC 90 4 μg/mL), and Enterobacter cloacae (MIC 90 4 μg/mL; Table 2; breakpoints available from the FDA). Omadacycline is also active against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC 90 1 μg/mL; breakpoints available from the FDA) and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC 90 0.25 μg/mL; Table 2). Omadacycline is not a substrate for extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs). It displays the same MIC 90 values against E. coli (2 μg/mL) and K. pneumoniae (8 μg/mL), whether ESBL negative or positive.

### Bacterium detected by Gram stain and drug sensitivity in Chinese children with acute sinusitis [^112wMWY4]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Determining the antibiotic sensitivity helps to reduce the occurrence of side effects and chronicity as well as the development of resistance to the bacteria. Amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate or cephalosporins were recommended by the EPOS2020 for children with complications or concomitant disease that could be exacerbated by ARS. Similarly, amoxicillin clavulanic acid, the second generation of cephalosporin and macrolide drugs are recommended by experts in China. Our data showed that amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium, a first-line antibiotic recommend by several guidelines, are useful for Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae as well as Haemophilus influenzae. While Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa could be inhibited by quinolones. Indeed, previous studies identified quinolones as the drug of choice for the treatment of ARS in penicillin-allergic patients, however, that quinolones often cause gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and nausea. Further studies are needed to investigate the safety and efficacy of quinolones to determine whether they can be used as first-line drugs for the treatment of ARS.

Our study had some limitations. First, our study is a single center research, so our results cannot be generalized to other pediatric populations of China. Second, children with ARS should be tested for viruses to further expand the knowledge of ARS in follow-up studies. Further muti-center studies with large samples should be conducted to better understand the etiology of ARS in Chinese children.

Despite of the above limitations, our study reported the distribution of bacterial infections and the antibiotic sensitivity in pediatric ARS of our center, which is the largest children's hospital with the most patients in South China. Our results provide a theoretical basis for a deeper understanding of the onset and clinical treatment of pediatric ARS.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^117DLH1Y]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

ATS/IDSA community-acquired pneumonia — Inpatient nonsevere CAP without risk factors for MRSA or P. aeruginosa is treated empirically with either a β-lactam plus a macrolide (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence) or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence). For adults with CAP who have contraindications to both macrolides and fluoroquinolones, a third option is a β-lactam plus doxycycline (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). The panel suggests that β-lactam monotherapy should not be routinely used for inpatients with CAP over fluoroquinolone monotherapy or β-lactam/macrolide combination therapy.

### Reply to huttner: 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^117Dmz7Y]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

From the Authors:

We appreciate this additional letter submitted in response to the recently published guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults.

Huttner and colleagues emphasize the importance of antimicrobial stewardship principles in shaping antibiotic treatment guidelines. We strongly agree. The adult CAP guideline emphasizes that when multiple options are presented the final antibiotic choice should be influenced by local and individual patient factors. We also emphasized the importance of deescalating antibiotics when appropriate and limiting the duration of antibiotic therapy. However, our highest priority was to assure that adequate empiric treatment is provided, especially for patients with more severe CAP. We did recommend amoxicillin as monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients, but the recommendation for expanded antibiotic therapy for outpatients with comorbidities reflected the need to cover for a broader range of potential pathogens. These outpatients represent a group that has not been clearly shown to be safely treated with β-lactam monotherapy. Ceftaroline was included as an option for treatment of inpatients with CAP given the available high-grade evidence (cited by Huttner and colleagues) that it is at least equivalent if not superior to ceftriaxone without evidence of an increased adverse event profile.

Finally, although we acknowledge that antimicrobial stewardship is relevant for all antibiotic prescribing decisions, it is important to highlight that, in a recent analysis of all outpatient antibiotic prescribing in the United States, pneumonia was only the 14th most common diagnosis, accounting for a small percentage of all antibiotics prescribed. For antimicrobial stewardship to actually impact the individual and population risks of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing, including the risks attributed to respiratory fluoroquinolones, more gains will be achieved by focusing on treatment strategies for upper respiratory infections, urinary tract infections, and gastrointestinal infections.

### Guidelines for empiric antimicrobial prescribing in community-acquired pneumonia [^116DFxue]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Empiric antimicrobial prescribing for community-acquired pneumonia remains a challenge, despite the availability of treatment guidelines. A number of key differences exist between North American and European guidelines, mainly in the outpatient setting. The North American approach is to use initial antimicrobial therapy, which provides coverage for Streptococcus pneumoniae plus atypical pathogens. Europeans tend to focus on providing pneumococcal coverage with less emphasis on covering for an atypical pathogen. Ambulatory patients without comorbidity are more likely to receive macrolide therapy in North America, whereas in Europe these patients would probably receive a beta-lactam agent. Major issues that are fundamental to this difference include the importance of providing therapy for atypical pathogens and the clinical significance of macrolide-resistant S pneumoniae. Prospective data are required to evaluate which of these two approaches offers clinical superiority.

### Antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia [^112hrKSv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, complicating the medical course of approximately 10% of mechanically-ventilated patients, with an estimated attributable mortality of 13%. To treat VAP empirically, the American Thoracic Society currently recommends antibiotic therapy based on the patients' risk of colonisation by an organism with multidrug resistance. The selection of initial antibiotic therapy in VAP is important, as inappropriate initial antimicrobial treatment is associated with higher mortality and longer hospital stay in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. While guidelines exist for the antibiotic treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) from the American Thoracic Society and the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, there are many limitations in the quality of available evidence. This systematic review aimed to summarise the results of all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compare empirical antibiotic regimens for VAP.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review was to assess the effect of different empirical antimicrobial therapies on the survival and clinical cure of adult patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Secondary objectives included reporting the incidence of adverse events, new superinfections, length of hospital stay, and length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay associated with these therapies.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL and Web of Science to December 2015; we searched ClinicalTrials.gov to September 2016.

Selection Criteria

Two review authors independently assessed RCTs comparing empirical antibiotic treatments of VAP in adult patients, where VAP was defined as new-onset pneumonia that developed more than 48 hours after endotracheal intubation. Physicians and researchers were not required to be blinded for inclusion in this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted study data. We pooled studies and analysed them in two ways. We examined monotherapy, or a single experimental antimicrobial drug, versus combination therapy, or multiple experimental antimicrobial drugs. We also examined carbapenem therapy versus non-carbapenem therapy.

Main Results

We included 12 studies with 3571 participants. All included studies examined the empiric use of one antimicrobial regimen versus another for the treatment of adults with VAP, but the particular drug regimens examined by each study varied. There was potential for bias because some studies did not report outcomes for all participants. All but one study reported sources of funding or author affiliations with pharmaceutical companies. We found no statistical difference in all-cause mortality between monotherapy and combination therapy (N = 4; odds ratio (OR) monotherapy versus combination 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.30), clinical cure (N = 2; OR monotherapy versus combination 0.88, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.36), length of stay in ICU (mean difference (MD) 0.65, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.23) or adverse events (N = 2; OR monotherapy versus combination 0.93, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.26). We downgraded the quality of evidence for all-cause mortality, adverse events, and length of ICU stay to moderate for this comparison. We determined clinical cure for this comparison to be of very low-quality evidence. For our second comparison of combination therapy with optional adjunctives only one meta-analysis could be performed due to a lack of trials comparing the same antibiotic regimens. Two studies compared tigecycline versus imipenem-cilastatin for clinical cure in the clinically evaluable population and there was a statistically significant increase in clinical cure for imipenem-cilastatin (N = 2; OR tigecycline versus imipenem-cilastatin 0.44, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.84). Of importance, this effect was due to a single study. We found no statistical difference in all-cause mortality between carbapenem and non-carbapenem therapies (N = 1; OR carbapenem versus non-carbapenem 0.59, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.19) or adverse events (N = 3; OR carbapenem versus non-carbapenem 0.78, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.09), but we found that carbapenems are associated with a statistically significant increase in the clinical cure (N = 3; OR carbapenem versus non-carbapenem 1.53, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.12 for intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and N = 2; OR carbapenem versus non-carbapenem 2.29, 95% CI 1.19 to 4.43 for clinically evaluable patients analysis). For this comparison we downgraded the quality of evidence for mortality, and clinical cure (ITT and clinically evaluable populations) to moderate. We determined the quality of evidence for adverse events to be low.

Authors' Conclusions

We did not find a difference between monotherapy and combination therapy for the treatment of people with VAP. Since studies did not identify patients with increased risk for multidrug-resistant bacteria, these data may not be generalisable to all patient groups. However, this is the largest meta-analysis comparing monotherapy to multiple antibiotic therapies for VAP and contributes further evidence to the safety of using effective monotherapy for the empiric treatment of VAP. Due to lack of studies, we could not evaluate the best antibiotic choice for VAP, but carbapenems as a class may result in better clinical cure than other tested antibiotics.

Infections of the lower respiratory tract, such as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB), comprise the more serious respiratory tract infections (RTIs), and are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality, particularly in groups such as the very young, the elderly and those with co-morbid illness. Up to 80% of community-acquired RTIs are caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae or Moraxella catarrhalis and are usually treated empirically. However, antibacterial resistance among common respiratory tract pathogens currently threatens the usefulness of existing therapies. The new ketolide antibacterial, telithromycin, has been developed specifically to provide optimal empirical treatment of community-acquired RTIs in the face of widespread antibacterial resistance. Telithromycin 800 mg once-daily offers efficacy equivalent to currently available antibacterials in the treatment of lower RTIs. Moreover, telithromycin demonstrates excellent activity in the treatment of CAP and AECB patients at risk for increased morbidity and mortality, including elderly patients, those with severe infections, and those with CAP complicated by pneumococcal bacteraemia. Telithromycin is also extremely effective in the treatment of patients with lower RTIs caused by atypical and intracellular pathogens (such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila and Chlamydophila [Chlamydia] pneumoniae — increasingly recognized as important aetiological agents of RTIs, particularly CAP), or by pathogens resistant to beta-lactams and macrolides. Telithromycin therefore represents a promising new agent for the empirical treatment of community-acquired RTIs.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^114NCFtS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In the United States, 6 in 10 adults have one chronic disease, and 4 in 10 adults have two or more chronic diseases, so the recommendation for amoxicillin will be applicable to a minority of adults with CAP. Therefore, U.S. physicians will most likely continue to treat many patients with the Watch group respiratory fluoroquinolones, a class of antibiotics with a well-documented propensity to favor the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance and Clostridioides difficile infections, as well as an increased risk of adverse events (U.S. Food and Drug Administration alert).

This will hamper the CDC's efforts to reduce overall antibiotic consumption and fluoroquinolone use in the United States. The Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee also suggested that guidelines should include recommendations to educate patients about antibiotic therapy when appropriate. Accordingly, the developers of the CAP guidelines could have considered providing guidance to physicians regarding the use of Access group antibiotics such as amoxicillin and doxycycline in select patients with stable comorbid conditions, along with close monitoring and adequate patient education.

Even more surprising is the listing of the Reserve group fifth-generation cephalosporin ceftaroline as a first-choice empiric treatment option for CAP (in combination with a macrolide) in hospitalized adults without risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Efficacy data from phase III trials suggesting that ceftaroline is superior to ceftriaxone with regard to clinical cure require further scrutiny, and its current listing as a first-choice option violates basic antibiotic stewardship considerations.

Given that respiratory tract infections are one of the most frequent reasons for antibiotic prescriptions worldwide, and that in many countries the U.S. treatment recommendations are still considered an important reference, it seems to us, as members of the WHO EML Antibiotics Working Group, that this represents a lost opportunity for antibiotic stewardship. We believe there is a clear need to better align all treatment guidelines to the same guiding principles, and to establish a global set of evidence-based recommendations with a focus on enhancing the use of Access group antibiotics.
