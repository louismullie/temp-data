## Question

Differential diagnosis for new sporadic intestinal cramps without diarrhea in 50 year old female with no other gastrointestinal history

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a differential diagnosis and workup plan for a 50-year-old woman with new, sporadic intestinal cramps without diarrhea. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about red flags and whether immediate evaluation is warranted. Then, I should verify the most likely functional diagnosis given the absence of diarrhea. Next, I will consider organic differentials that can present with cramps alone, including medication effects, ischemia, IBD, celiac disease, and rare entities like hereditary angioedema. After that, I need to outline a staged diagnostic approach, starting with history, exam, and targeted labs, and escalating to imaging or endoscopy only if indicated. Finally, I will synthesize a prioritized differential and propose initial management and follow-up, ensuring I double-check that each step aligns with guideline-based care and the patient's risk profile [^112QDC5r] [^112mf9wd].

> Let me first confirm the red flags and alarm features that would change urgency and scope of testing in a 50-year-old with new abdominal cramps. I need to check for weight loss, gastrointestinal bleeding, iron-deficiency anemia, nocturnal symptoms, fever, family history of colorectal cancer or IBD, and new-onset symptoms after age 50, because these features lower the threshold for colonoscopy and cross-sectional imaging even in the absence of diarrhea [^112mf9wd]. Hold on, I should verify that colon ischemia can present with cramping pain and hematochezia or even isolated pain in older adults; yes, colon ischemia typically manifests with sudden cramping left lower quadrant pain, urgency, and bleeding, and isolated right-sided ischemia can present with pain alone, so age and vascular risk matter here [^116Ga8RX] [^113innnM]. I also need to ensure I do not overlook medication-induced cramps, including osmotic agents like lactulose and oral contrast agents, which can cause transient cramping without diarrhea, so a meticulous medication and supplement review is essential [^1169dK5T] [^111kQjPd].

> Next, I should review the most likely diagnosis given the absence of diarrhea and the sporadic, crampy nature of pain. Functional abdominal cramping pain fits well when there are recurrent cramps without red flags, no strong association with defecation, and no bowel habit disruption, and it is explicitly defined as mild-to-moderate, undulating, recurring cramping pain in the absence of structural disease markers or IBS features [^112MCvSf] [^113JCwPj]. Wait, let me verify the distinction from IBS: IBS requires abdominal pain associated with altered stool form or frequency by Rome IV, so cramps alone without stool changes argue against IBS here, though FACP may represent part of the IBS spectrum without bowel habit alteration [^112MCvSf]. I should double-check that expert guidance supports antispasmodics as first-line for FACP once organic disease is reasonably excluded; yes, antispasmodics are recommended initially, with peppermint oil as a reasonable OTC option given its antispasmodic properties and IBS evidence base extrapolated to FACP [^116qok39] [^112ywSMS].

> I will now examine medication and supplement causes that can mimic or cause cramping without diarrhea. Lactulose commonly causes flatulence and intestinal cramps, especially at initiation or with higher doses, so I need to ask specifically about laxatives, sugar alcohols, and fiber supplements [^1169dK5T]. But wait, what if she recently had a barium study or oral contrast for imaging; barium sulfate products frequently cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping, so timing relative to any contrast exposure matters [^111kQjPd] [^112k3drA]. I should also review for chemotherapeutic agents like irinotecan, which cause early and late diarrhea with cramping; even without overt diarrhea, early cramping can occur, so oncology or recent cytotoxic exposure is pertinent [^113RK545] [^111DEg7o].

> Let me consider ischemic colitis next, even though diarrhea and bleeding are common, because isolated cramping can occur, particularly with right-sided disease. Colon ischemia typically presents with sudden cramping left lower quadrant pain, urgency, and hematochezia within 24 hours, but right-sided ischemia may lack bleeding and can be mistaken for functional pain in older adults, so I should confirm vascular risk factors and consider CT angiography or colonoscopy if alarm features emerge or symptoms persist [^116Ga8RX]. Hold on, I should verify that chronic ischemic colitis can present with intermittent pain; yes, chronic segmental ischemic colitis can mimic IBD or functional disorders, reinforcing the need for a low threshold to evaluate when symptoms persist or evolve [^111BtEbi].

> I need to check for inflammatory bowel disease even in the absence of diarrhea, because IBD can occasionally present with pain-predominant symptoms, particularly early or mild disease. Ulcerative colitis typically features bloody diarrhea with urgency and cramping, but limited or mild disease may present with cramps and minimal stool change, so I should ask about nocturnal symptoms, weight loss, extraintestinal features, and family history, and consider fecal calprotectin and colonoscopy if red flags are present or symptoms persist beyond a few weeks [^111GRpsa] [^111KpHv8]. Let me reconsider Crohn's disease as well; it can cause intermittent cramping from partial obstruction or transmural inflammation, and post-diverticulitis IBS-like syndromes can mimic IBD, so a careful history of prior diverticulitis or surgery is important [^116Kh3gB] [^117U14mP].

> Celiac disease remains on the list because it can present with abdominal pain or cramping without classic diarrhea, especially in older adults. I should confirm whether there are nutritional red flags, anemia, or osteoporosis risk, and if suspected, order tTG-IgA with total IgA, recognizing that guidelines support selective testing in patients with compatible symptoms even when diarrhea is absent [^115df2FH] [^114bfdyR]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought celiac serology is only for those with diarrhea; that is too restrictive, as celiac disease can be subtle and extra-intestinal, so testing is reasonable when symptoms, age, or risk factors raise suspicion [^114bfdyR].

> Rare but important, I should consider hereditary angioedema when attacks are episodic, severe, crampy, and resolve completely between episodes, especially in women with hormonal triggers. Abdominal attacks are common in HAE, often with distension and nausea, and isolated abdominal pain occurs in nearly half of GI attacks; nonresponse to antihistamines, steroids, or epinephrine and a family history of angioedema should prompt C1 inhibitor level and function testing, given the availability of targeted therapies and the risk of unnecessary surgery when misdiagnosed [^111KDfRy] [^1173vdMQ]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; HAE is rare, so I should reserve this for recurrent, stereotyped attacks with complete resolution and supportive clues before ordering specialized testing [^111KDfRy].

> Next, I should review the initial diagnostic approach in primary care, keeping it low-yield but targeted. I need to ensure a meticulous history covering pain character, temporal pattern, relation to meals and defecation, medication and supplement use, family history of GI disease, and psychosocial stressors, followed by a focused exam including vitals, abdominal tenderness, masses, and a digital rectal exam if indicated [^114bfdyR]. Let me verify the limited labs that are reasonable: CBC, ESR or CRP, and selective thyroid and liver tests can screen for inflammation or systemic disease; fecal calprotectin is useful when IBD is suspected, and celiac serology if symptoms or risk warrant it; abdominal ultrasound can be considered for biliary or gynecologic sources when indicated [^114bfdyR] [^114oH5gi]. I should confirm that these steps align with FACP guidance emphasizing exclusion of red flags before labeling as functional, which they do [^112QDC5r].

> If symptoms persist, evolve, or red flags emerge, I need to escalate thoughtfully. Colonoscopy is appropriate for patients over 50 with new symptoms, anemia, weight loss, bleeding, or persistent pain, and CT colonography is an alternative if colonoscopy is contraindicated or incomplete; cross-sectional imaging with CT abdomen/pelvis is reasonable when pain is severe, atypical, or associated with systemic features, and CT angiography is indicated if ischemia is suspected [^112Rbjc6]. Wait, let me verify that right-sided ischemia warrants a lower threshold for CTA; yes, isolated right-sided ischemia carries higher mortality and may lack classic bleeding, so early vascular imaging is prudent when suspected [^113innnM].

> I should double-check that my prioritized differential remains consistent with the data. Most likely is functional abdominal cramping pain given the absence of diarrhea, lack of red flags, and sporadic crampy pain, with IBS less likely without bowel habit alteration but still in the broader spectrum of gut-brain interaction disorders [^112MCvSf]. Second, I need to keep medication-induced cramps high on the list until a thorough review excludes lactulose, barium, or cytotoxic agents, as these are reversible causes [^1169dK5T] [^111kQjPd]. Third, colon ischemia must be considered in this age group, especially with vascular risk or persistent pain, even if bleeding is absent [^116Ga8RX]. Fourth, early or mild IBD and celiac disease remain possibilities and warrant fecal calprotectin, celiac serology, and colonoscopy if symptoms persist or alarms appear [^111GRpsa] [^114bfdyR]. Finally, rare entities like HAE should be considered for recurrent, severe, episodic cramping that resolves completely between attacks, particularly with hormonal triggers or family history [^111KDfRy].

> For initial management, assuming no red flags and a reassuring exam and basic labs, I should confirm that symptomatic therapy is appropriate. Antispasmodics such as hyoscine or dicyclomine are reasonable first-line agents, and peppermint oil is an evidence-based OTC alternative with antispasmodic properties; if one agent fails, a trial of a different class is reasonable before moving to other modalities [^116qok39] [^112ywSMS]. I need to ensure the patient receives education on red flags and when to seek care, and I should arrange follow-up within 4 to 6 weeks to reassess trajectory and response, escalating to colonoscopy or imaging if symptoms persist, worsen, or new alarms develop [^114renY9].

In a 50-year-old woman with new, sporadic intestinal cramps and no diarrhea, the most likely diagnosis is **functional abdominal cramping pain (FACP)** [^112MCvSf], a functional disorder characterized by episodic cramping without bowel habit changes or red flags [^113JCwPj]. The key differentials to consider are **irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)** [^112Rbjc6] (if pain relates to bowel movements or stool form), **microscopic colitis** [^116Mtqk5] (common in older women, often with watery diarrhea), and **colon ischemia** [^116Ga8RX] (especially with vascular risk factors or postprandial pain). Less likely causes include inflammatory bowel disease [^111GRpsa], celiac disease [^115df2FH], lactose intolerance [^112mf9wd], medication effects [^1169dK5T], and rare entities like hereditary angioedema [^111KDfRy] or carcinoid syndrome [^notfound]. Initial workup should focus on **red flags** [^112QDC5r], a focused history, exam, and selective labs (CBC, CRP/ESR, celiac serology, TSH) [^114bfdyR]; colonoscopy is indicated if alarm features are present or symptoms persist [^notfound].

## Functional abdominal cramping pain (FACP)

- **Definition**: FACP is defined as recurrent, episodic cramping abdominal pain without bowel habit disturbance or red flags, typically not significantly interfering with daily activities [^112MCvSf] [^113JCwPj].

- **Pathophysiology**: Thought to reflect a disorder of gut–brain interaction [^117DVFSv] with altered motility and visceral hypersensitivity, often overlapping with IBS but without bowel habit changes [^116i2Awn] [^114Raf8A] [^112MCvSf].

- **Diagnosis**: Clinical, after excluding organic disease; no specific tests are required in the absence of red flags [^112QDC5r] [^116qok39].

- **Management**: Antispasmodics (e.g. hyoscine, dicyclomine) [^116qok39] or peppermint oil [^notfound] are first-line; reassurance and lifestyle measures are key [^112owug1].

---

## Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)

- **Definition**: IBS presents with abdominal pain associated with altered bowel habits (diarrhea, constipation, or mixed) [^112Rbjc6] by Rome IV criteria [^112mf9wd].

- **Pathophysiology**: Multifactorial, involving visceral hypersensitivity, altered motility, and gut–brain axis dysfunction [^114Raf8A].

- **Diagnosis**: Clinical, using Rome IV, after excluding organic disease; alarm features warrant further evaluation [^112mf9wd].

- **Management**: Diet (low FODMAP), antispasmodics, psychological therapies, and medications tailored to subtype [^112wgh25].

---

## Microscopic colitis

- **Definition**: Chronic watery diarrhea with normal colonoscopy, diagnosed on biopsy; subtypes are lymphocytic and collagenous colitis [^notfound].

- **Pathophysiology**: Immune-mediated, often medication-related (NSAIDs, PPIs, SSRIs) or autoimmune associations.

- **Diagnosis**: Colonoscopy with biopsies, even if mucosa appears normal [^notfound].

- **Management**: Stop offending drugs, budesonide, antidiarrheals, bile acid binders [^notfound].

---

## Colon ischemia (ischemic colitis)

- **Definition**: Reduced colonic blood flow causing cramping pain, often postprandial, with or without bleeding [^116Ga8RX].

- **Risk factors**: Age > 50, vascular disease, hypercoagulable states, medications (estrogens, NSAIDs) [^notfound].

- **Diagnosis**: CT angiography or colonoscopy with biopsies [^notfound].

- **Management**: Supportive care, treat underlying vascular disease, surgery if severe [^notfound].

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

- **History and examination**: Characterize pain, bowel habits, diet, medications, family history, and systemic symptoms; look for red flags (weight loss, bleeding, anemia, nocturnal symptoms) [^112QDC5r] [^114bfdyR].

- **Initial laboratory tests**: CBC, CRP/ESR, TSH, celiac serology, stool calprotectin if IBD suspected [^114bfdyR] [^114oH5gi].

- **Imaging**: Abdominal ultrasound or CT if alarm features or persistent symptoms [^114bfdyR].

- **Colonoscopy**: Indicated if alarm features, persistent symptoms, or abnormal labs; consider microscopic colitis biopsies even with normal mucosa [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

- **Functional disorders**: Antispasmodics, peppermint oil, dietary modifications, reassurance, and lifestyle measures [^116qok39] [^112ywSMS].

- **Organic disease**: Treat underlying cause (e.g. budesonide for microscopic colitis, dietary restriction for lactose intolerance, surgery for IBD complications) [^notfound].

- **Follow-up**: Reassess in 4–6 weeks; if no improvement or red flags develop, escalate evaluation [^112QDC5r].

---

In a 50-year-old woman with new, sporadic intestinal cramps and no diarrhea, **FACP is most likely**, but IBS, microscopic colitis, and colon ischemia must be considered. A **focused history, exam, and selective labs** are the initial steps, with colonoscopy if alarm features are present or symptoms persist [^112mf9wd].

Patients with FACP may also present with other co-occurring gastrointestinal symptoms, such as constipation or diarrhea. Though they should not be ignored, there is little evidence that treating these symptoms and improving bowel habits will, in isolation, improve FACP.

ALGORITHMS TO AID THE RECOGNITION AND MANAGEMENT OF FACP

A proposed algorithm for the optimal diagnosis and management of FACP by physicians, considered by the expert panel to be appropriate for use in primary care, is presented in Figure 2. This algorithm is based on the definition of FACP, and the management considerations outlined in the preceding sections. The starting point for the diagnosis is the core symptomatic manifestation of FACP, pain with cramping characteristics, which is generally considered to arise from primary gastrointestinal dysfunction. To establish the diagnosis of FACP, the critical first step is exclusion of a structural organic cause. This can be achieved through the recognition of alarm signals ("red flags") related to other symptoms experienced and/or the patient's family history of disease, and by considering the results of appropriate investigations, conducted as indicated by such signals. The algorithm considers the likelihood of an IBS diagnosis in cases where FACP symptoms are associated with bowel habit alterations, thus emphasizing the distinction between IBS (as defined by the Rome IV criteria) and the definition of FACP proposed here. The algorithm also seeks to rule out abdominal pain of gynecologic or cardiac origin. For first-line treatment, antispasmodics are recommended for patients whose symptoms fulfill the consensus definition of FACP and who lack signals of a potential differential diagnosis or other avoidable explanatory factors. Additional treatment options are suggested for patients who fail to achieve satisfactory symptom alleviation with first-line antispasmodic therapy.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: expert practical guidance [^112owug1]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Functional abdominal cramping pain (FACP) is a common complaint, which may present either on its own or in association with a functional gastrointestinal disorder. It is likely caused by a variety of, probably partly unknown, etiologies. Effective management of FACP can be challenging owing to the lack of usable diagnostic tools and the availability of a diverse range of treatment approaches. Practical guidance for their selection and use is limited. The objective of this article is to present a working definition of FACP based on expert consensus, and to propose practical strategies for the diagnosis and management of this condition for physicians, pharmacists, and patients. A panel of experts on functional gastrointestinal disorders was convened to participate in workshop activities aimed at defining FACP and agreeing upon a recommended sequence of diagnostic criteria and management recommendations. The key principles forming the foundation of the definition of FACP and suggested management algorithms include the primacy of cramping pain as the distinguishing symptom; the importance of recognizing and acting upon alarm signals of potential structural disease; the recognition of known causes that might be addressed through lifestyle adjustment; and the central role of antispasmodics in the treatment of FACP. The proposed algorithm is intended to assist physicians in reaching a meaningful diagnostic endpoint based on patient-reported symptoms of FACP. We also discuss how this algorithm may be adapted for use by pharmacists and patients.

### Incidence and management of toxicity associated with ibrutinib and idelalisib: a practical approach [^111bDFve]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Incidence and severity

Diarrhea can occur at any time after initiation of idelalisib and its incidence is higher in treatment-naïve patients (42%)than in patients with relapsed/refractory disease (4–18%). Diarrhea that occurs within the first 8 weeks of idelalisib use is usually grade 1–2 (i.e. an increase in stools of up to six stools per day over baseline).

Late-onset diarrhea is generally grade ≥ 3, with a median time to onset of 7.1 months and there are no accompanying symptoms such as cramps, blood or mucus. Colonoscopy shows macroscopic, in some cases ulcerative, colitis, and histology shows lymphocytic colitis in combination with characteristic epithelial cell apoptosis and neutrophilic cryptitis. Idelalisib-induced intestinal perforation is rare (< 0.5%).

Although a definitive underlying mechanism for idelalisib-associated diarrhea is unknown, PI3K δ inhibition has been associated with immune dysregulation resulting in inhibition of regulatory T cells and increased damage via CD8 + cytotoxic T cells.–

### Incidence and epidemiology of irritable bowel syndrome after a large waterborne outbreak of bacterial dysentery [^1128hsMb]. Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) is a common clinical phenomenon. To better define its incidence and epidemiology, a large cohort study was initiated after the contamination of a municipal water supply led to a large outbreak of acute Escherichia coli 0157:H7 and Campylobacter jejuni gastroenteritis.

Methods

Local residents were invited to undergo structured assessments at research clinics established 2 years after the outbreak. Permanent adult residents with no prior history of inflammatory bowel disease or IBS were eligible. Standardized questionnaires defined past and current health. The cohort was divided into controls without gastroenteritis, subjects with clinically suspected gastroenteritis, and subjects with only self-reported gastroenteritis that could not be substantiated by another source. A modified Bowel Disease Questionnaire identified IBS according to Rome criteria. The incidence and epidemiology of PI-IBS was characterized. Risk factors were assessed using multiple logistic regression.

Results

There were 2069 eligible study participants. Rome I criteria were met by 71 of 701 controls (10.1%) vs 249 of 904 subjects with self-reported gastroenteritis (27.5%) and 168 of 464 subjects with clinically suspected gastroenteritis (36.2%) (all comparisons, P < 001). Independent risk factors for PI-IBS included younger age, female sex, bloody stools, abdominal cramps, weight loss, and prolonged diarrhea. PI-IBS was more likely than sporadic IBS to show diarrhea-predominant features.

Conclusions

PI-IBS is common after gastroenteritis from water contamination and often is diarrhea-predominant. Characteristics of the acute illness identify patients at increased risk for PI-IBS.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^111GRpsa]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) symptom evaluation and infection workup highlight that symptoms of bloody diarrhea, presence of mucus, bowel urgency, tenesmus, and abdominal cramping should trigger consideration of a diagnosis of UC, particularly in the absence of an alternate cause, and that history should assess extraintestinal manifestations including joint, skin, ocular, oral, and hepatobiliary involvement. Potential precipitants may include recent smoking cessation, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, and enteric infections. C. difficile infection (CDI) is recognized as complicating a significant proportion of patients with UC and is associated with increased risk of hospitalizations, colectomy, and mortality; among newly diagnosed or relapsing inflammatory bowel disease patients, CDI prevalence ranges from 5% to 47%, and concomitant CDI with UC has worse outcomes, including higher mortality. Testing for C. difficile is typically performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Other enteric infections that could mimic UC include Escherichia coli (O157:H7), Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Campylobacter, and parasitic infections like amoebiasis, so an infectious etiology should always be suspected and excluded at time of diagnosis and in the right clinical setting, with several institutions using comprehensive intestinal pathogen testing through PCR-based assays that may detect many bacterial and viral pathogens.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF STATEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Background

Functional abdominal cramping pain (FACP) is a common complaint that may present on its own or as a predominant symptom of a functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID). Despite the studies suggesting a high prevalence of FACP in the general population, the Rome classification for FGIDs does not consider it to be a discrete symptomatic entity.

Definition

The expert panel proposes the following definition for FACP, as reported by patients with or without a diagnosed FGID:

"FACP refers to the sudden occurrence of mild-to-moderate, undulating, and recurring cramping pain in any part of the abdomen, lasting for seconds to minutes or up to a few hours, in the absence of any "red flag" signs/symptoms of structural organic disease or any strong association with defecation (which might indicate irritable bowel syndrome [IBS]), and typically not significantly interfering with daily activities".

FACP could be perceived as reflecting part of the IBS spectrum but without a strong association with bowel irregularities. In situations where FACP is tightly linked with abnormalities of bowel evacuation, a diagnosis of IBS should be suspected, provided that patients fulfill the Rome IV diagnostic criteria.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: expert practical guidance [^113JCwPj]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

DEFINITION OF FACP

The latest Rome IV criteria focus on the diagnosis and overall management of FGIDs rather than on the specific presentation and symptomatic treatment of FACP (Supplemental Digital Content Table 1). Furthermore, although FACP has been reported in the literature without association with a particular disorder,–there is no standardized definition. We, therefore, propose the following definition for FACP:

Definition of FACP:

FACP refers to the sudden occurrence of mild-to-moderate, undulating, and recurring cramping pain in any part of the abdomen, lasting for seconds to minutes or up to a few hours, in the absence of any "red flag" signs/symptoms of structural organic disease or any strong association with defecation (which might indicate IBS), and typically not significantly interfering with daily activities.

FACP could be perceived as reflecting part of the IBS spectrum but without a strong association with bowel irregularities. In situations where FACP is tightly linked with abnormalities of bowel evacuation, a diagnosis of IBS should be suspected, provided that patients fulfill the Rome IV diagnostic criteria.

DIAGNOSIS AND INVESTIGATION OF FACP IN PRIMARY CARE

Ruling Out Organic Pathology

Recommendations:

When evaluating FACP in primary care, the first step is to rule out "red flags" (alarm signals) of structural organic disease, which necessitate referral to a specialist.

Comments

When a patient first presents to primary care with symptoms of FACP, the first step is to rule out potentially serious organic disease. Key red flag signs and symptoms that could indicate structural disease are summarized in Table 1. Patients presenting with any indicators of organic disease require referral to a specialist for further investigation.

TABLE 1
Red Flag (Alarm) Signs That May Be Present in Patients With Functional Abdominal Cramping Pain (List Not Exhaustive),–

Investigations and Diagnosis

Recommendations:

A detailed evaluation of family history, medication, characteristics of pain, and eating/bowel habits should be undertaken in all patients presenting to primary care with FACP symptoms.
In selected cases and at the discretion of the doctor, a physical examination (including bowel sounds and digital rectal examination), laboratory tests, and psychosocial assessment may also be appropriate. Abdominal ultrasound investigations may be helpful.

CONCLUSIONS

FACP is a common presentation, occurring either alone or in association with FGIDs, which can impact on the quality of life of sufferers and place a burden on health care resources. Here, we have proposed a definition of FACP, which we believe has substantial potential utility to inform the diagnosis and management of this common and under-recognized condition. Although probably falling within the continuum of the IBS spectrum, but without a strong, direct association with bowel evacuation, studies to further investigate the presentation, course, and pathophysiology of FACP are needed. Recommendations for the diagnosis and management of FACP are provided (albeit based largely on the existing literature for FGIDs because of a lack of specific data on FACP), with a focus on primary care management. Algorithms for use by PCPs/GPs, pharmacists, and patients are also presented to aid the recognition and symptomatic management of FACP in the primary care and pharmacy settings.

In many countries across the world, the clinical diagnosis and management of patients with FACP is typically undertaken in primary care practice. Self-care, with the assistance of pharmacists as needed may, however, also serve as a successful handling approach for patients whose condition can be managed adequately with over-the-counter pharmaceuticals and/or nonpharmacologic approaches. This approach is especially relevant in settings where access to health care may be limited.

### Epidemiology of traveler's diarrhea [^113SAYFA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Among travelers from developed countries who visit developing countries, > 60% may experience traveler's diarrhea, accounting for 40,000 travelers daily or > 15 million travelers annually. Traveler's diarrhea is often accompanied by other symptoms, most often abdominal cramps. Although the spontaneous cure occurs after a mean of 4 days, a few patients have symptoms for weeks, and it is increasingly noted that some patients may later develop irritable bowel syndrome. Traveler's diarrhea is life threatening only exceptionally, but it frequently it leads to incapacitation. Both host factors (e.g., age, behavior, nationality, and genetic factors) and environmental factors (primarily the selected destination and hotel) play an important role in risk for traveler's diarrhea.

### Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy: a clinicopathological mimic of Crohn's disease [^114yjo5Y]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 27-year-old white-British female (Patient 1) born to non-consanguineous parents developed intermittent episodes of diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal cramps aged 18, associated with significant weight loss. Symptoms were initially presumed to be post-infectious, given her extensive travel history to Sub-Saharan Africa, South America and South-East Asia. This first episode resolved spontaneously.

Aged 25, she represented with diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain and bloating. Family history was notable for an elder sister (Patient 2) with a diagnosis of Crohn's disease. Faecal calprotectin was significantly raised (> 600; ref. 0–50⎧g/g). Tissue transglutaminase IgA antibody, serial stool samples for faecal culture, ova, cysts and parasites, and Clostridium Difficile toxin testing, were negative. Gastroscopy revealed appearances consistent with a dilated second part of the duodenum in keeping with possible small bowel obstruction. Colonoscopy was challenging due to a sharply angulated sigmoid colon and significant patient discomfort. Despite multiple attempts, it was not possible to intubate and biopsy the terminal ileum. Colonic biopsies obtained showed a panproctocolitis compatible with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (Fig. 1 a). Magnetic resonance (MR) enterography identified a 2 cm segment of terminal ileum with mural thickening and oedema and intermediate enhancement. There was separation of bowel loops in the distal ileal mesentery suggestive of fat proliferation. The remainder of the small bowel and large bowel were normal, with no enlarged nodes, free fluid or fluid collection (Fig. 1 c-e).

ACG clinical guideline — clinical presentation evidence for CI describes common symptoms and timing: in a retrospective study of 401 patients admitted with CI, the most common symptoms were abdominal pain (78%), rectal bleeding (84%), diarrhea (56%), and nausea (38%); in 22 Korean biopsy-proven CI patients, abdominal pain (77.8%), hematochezia (58.3%), bloody diarrhea (34.7%), and nonbloody diarrhea (19.4%) were common; vomiting (30%), dizziness (10%), and syncope (6%) occur less frequently; in IRCI, only 25–46% have rectal bleeding and physicians should entertain the diagnosis of IRCI for patients with acute, severe abdominal pain who lack hematochezia and/or diarrhea; in a Swiss cohort of 49 biopsy-proven CI patients, 57.1% presented within 24 h and 75.5% within 3 days of symptom onset; CI generally manifests with sudden cramping, mild, left lower abdominal pain; an urgent desire to defecate; and passage within 24 h of bright red or maroon blood per rectum or bloody diarrhea.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) — clinically significant diarrhea operational features include that the Bristol Stool Scale may be used to score stool quality with unformed stools defined as Bristol score 5–7, and diarrhea is defined at least 3 or > 3 diarrheal bowel movements within 24 hours; HCP should document frequency and consistency of stools in the medical record; recent outbreaks of severe CDI indicate that it is not always possible to wait 24–48 hours before determining whether a patient has clinically significant diarrhea, so diarrhea plus abdominal cramping has also been used to satisfy criteria, although it is normal for some patients to have 3 or more bowel movements per day that are usually not diarrheal, and the definition of clinically significant diarrhea has not been validated for stool quality or quantity.

### Consider hereditary angioedema in the differential diagnosis for unexplained recurring abdominal pain [^111KDfRy]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Health care providers are likely to encounter patients with recurrent unexplained abdominal pain. Because hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare disease, it may not be part of the differential diagnosis, especially for patients who do not have concurrent skin swelling in addition to abdominal symptoms. Abdominal pain is very common in patients with HAE, occurring in up to 93% of patients, with recurrent abdominal pain reported in up to 80% of patients. In 49% of HAE attacks with abdominal symptoms, isolated abdominal pain was the only symptom. Other abdominal symptoms that commonly present in patients with HAE include distension, cramping, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The average time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis is 6 to 23 years. Under-recognition of HAE in patients presenting with predominant gastrointestinal symptoms is a key factor contributing to the delay in diagnosis, increasing the likelihood of unnecessary or exploratory surgeries or procedures and the potential risk of related complications. HAE should be considered in the differential diagnosis for patients with unexplained abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea who have complete resolution of symptoms between episodes. As highly effective targeted therapies for HAE exist, recognition and diagnosis of HAE in patients presenting with isolated abdominal pain may significantly improve morbidity and mortality for these individuals.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^114b2r6T]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

IDSA infectious diarrhea — clinical presentations and likely etiologies are listed as follows: Persistent or chronic diarrhea has likely pathogens including Cryptosporidium spp. Giardia lamblia, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Cystoisospora belli, and Entamoeba histolytica. Visible blood in stool lists STEC (Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli), Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Entamoeba histolytica, noncholera Vibrio species, Yersinia, Balantidium coli, and Plesiomonas as likely pathogens. Fever is not highly discriminatory — viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections can cause fever; in general, higher temperatures are suggestive of bacterial or E. histolytica, and patients infected with STEC usually are not febrile at time of presentation. Severe abdominal pain, often with grossly bloody stools (occasionally nonbloody) and minimal or no fever, lists STEC, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, and Yersinia enterocolitica as likely pathogens. Persistent abdominal pain and fever lists Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis and may mimic appendicitis. Nausea and vomiting within ≤ 24 hours suggests ingestion of Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin or Bacillus cereus (short-incubation emetic syndrome). Diarrhea and abdominal cramping lasting 1–2 days suggests ingestion of Clostridium perfringens or B. cereus (long-incubation diarrheal syndrome). Vomiting and nonbloody diarrhea lasting 2–3 days lists norovirus as the likely pathogen.

### Masquerading in the midgut: a rare diagnosis in a patient with recurrent abdominal pain [^1144NRKf]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

A 38-year-old woman who had been previously diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome was seen in the outpatient clinic with a 2-year history of intermittent cramp-like abdominal pain which was often followed by watery diarrhoea. She had presented several times previously to the emergency department with episodes of severe pain and collapse although on arrival examination findings were mostly unremarkable other than some mild lower abdominal tenderness. On each occasion, the symptoms resolved spontaneously with conservative management. She had been extensively investigated by her general practitioner to establish the cause of her symptoms but all laboratory findings, cross-sectional imaging, ultrasound and oesophagogastroduodenoscopy to date were unremarkable. After being seen in gastroenterology outpatients' clinic, a colonoscopy was performed and was described as being macroscopically normal but microscopic evaluation of colonic biopsies suggested a possible 'resolving infection'. She was treated symptomatically, but within 6 months she represented to hospital with progressively worsening symptoms of severe abdominal pain, now associated with vomiting, followed by watery diarrhoea and then resolution of the symptoms. An abdominal CT scan was performed which showed a small intraluminal-filling defect in the mid-terminal ileum. A wireless capsule endoscopy was organised to further characterise the lesion although this was reported as showing no abnormality. Prior to any further outpatient investigations, she represented as an emergency to hospital in small bowel obstruction, underwent further cross-sectional imaging followed by surgical resection of the lesion. Histological characterisation revealed a small bowel inflammatory fibroid polyp.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: expert practical guidance [^114bfdyR]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Comments

As with FGIDs in general, a comprehensive patient assessment is needed to rule out red flags and to characterize the FACP. We recommend that the assessment includes an evaluation of family history (especially for malignancy, gastrointestinal diseases, and other conditions that could affect their management), current and recent medication, characteristics of pain (nature, location, duration, quality, frequency, and severity), and eating/bowel habits (including known food allergies, intolerances, and triggers). In selected patients and at the discretion of the doctor, a physical examination (including bowel sounds and digital rectal examination) and limited laboratory tests may be appropriate, and psychosocial assessment may also be helpful, particularly if the patient has preexisting psychiatric comorbidities or there are indicators of significant psychological stress. The physical examination should assess the pain location and whether there is a palpable mass, abnormal or absent bowel sounds, rebound tenderness, rigidity/resistance, distension, and/or guarding. Experience in IBS shows that relevant laboratory tests might include complete blood cell counts and other targeted blood tests (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and/or celiac serology), thyroid and liver function tests, and stool studies (eg, fecal calprotectin and/or occult blood test), as indicated. Abdominal ultrasound investigations can sometimes be helpful and are cheap and simple to undertake in most settings. There are also certain other signs and symptoms that may require additional evaluation. For example, for pain in women that seems to be related to the menses, a gynecologic evaluation should be considered. Similarly, for pain brought on by physical exertion, a cardiology assessment should be sought. If the initial investigations raise concerns or are equivocal, referral for a computerized axial tomography scan might be considered.

Assuming none of the red flag signs/symptoms are present and no abnormalities are identified at the physical examination, laboratory tests, or other investigations, a diagnosis of FACP may be considered if the symptoms are described by the present definition. If the FACP is tightly related to changes in bowel evacuation, IBS is the most probable diagnosis and should be confirmed using the Rome IV criteria.

### A case report of delayed lower intestinal bleeding after organophosphate poisoning [^117KcKu1]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

We report about a 78-year-old woman who drank a mouthful of OP and developed delayed GI bleeding 6 weeks after pesticide consumption. The clinical symptoms of the patient were unique for OP poisoning; this was a rare event of OP poisoning that was followed by late-onset lower GI bleeding, which prolonged the patient's recovery course and parenteral alimentation period.

OP toxicity is caused by its ability to inhibit acetylcholinesterase, leading to the accumulation of acetylcholine, which causes the overstimulation of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors in the peripheral and central nervous systems. Hence, the symptoms of OP poisoning are related to neural functions and can be divided into three categories: acute (within 24 h), subacute (24 h to 2 weeks; e.g. extra-pyramidal symptoms, miosis, and bradycardia), and chronic (beyond 2 weeks; e.g. peripheral neuropathy).

Acute symptoms, including salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastric cramps, and emesis (SLUDGE), may occur within minutes to hours and are pathognomonic to the early stages of the disease. The most severe and life-threatening symptom of OP poisoning is respiratory failure, and our case presented with the same. The decrease in respiratory function may have resulted in central neurological apnea.

GI symptoms that present in OP poisoning cases mostly include diarrhea, stomach cramps, and increased salivation. Nevertheless, GI bleeding has also been reported in several cases. This can be in the form of upper GI bleeding, delayed colonic bleeding, or multiple small intestinal perforations. In cases of acute small intestinal perforation, patients may succumb to the illness over a span of several days. The treatment and prognosis of OP-induced small intestinal bleeding were difficult to address in our case. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only case presenting a feasible treatment for OP-induced small intestinal bleeding.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Patients and caregivers should be informed of gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea. Patients should have loperamide readily available to begin treatment for late diarrhea (generally occurring more than 24 hours after administration of CAMPTOSAR). Begin loperamide at the first episode of poorly formed or loose stools or the earliest onset of bowel movements more frequent than normal. One dosage regimen for loperamide is 4 mg at the first onset of late diarrhea and then 2 mg every 2 hours until the patient is diarrhea-free for at least 12 hours. Loperamide is not recommended to be used for more than 48 consecutive hours at these doses, because of the risk of paralytic ileus. During the night, the patient may take 4 mg of loperamide every 4 hours. Patients should contact their physician if any of the following occur: diarrhea for the first time during treatment; black or bloody stools; symptoms of dehydration such as lightheadedness, dizziness, or faintness; inability to take fluids by mouth due to nausea or vomiting; or inability to get diarrhea under control within 24 hours.
Patients should be warned about the potential for dizziness or visual disturbances which may occur within 24 hours following the administration of CAMPTOSAR.
Explain the significance of routine blood cell counts. Instruct patients to monitor their temperature frequently and immediately report any occurrence of fever or infection.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]
Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy.
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with CAMPTOSAR and for 6 months after the final dose.
Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment and for 3 months after the final dose of CAMPTOSAR.
Lactation
Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with CAMPTOSAR and for at least 7 days after the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].
Infertility
Advise females and males of reproductive potential that CAMPTOSAR may impair fertility [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].
Patients should be alerted to the possibility of alopecia.

Chronic ischemic colitis — definition, presentation, and frequency — chronic segmental colitis should be defined clinically by more than 3 months of typical symptoms with biopsy confirmation compatible with CI. The most common presentation is abdominal pain and urgent desire to defecate followed by bloody diarrhea (32.3%), while rectal bleeding without prior abdominal pain is also seen (30.8%). Reported frequency estimates vary widely from an unquantified rare to 25%, and one series found 17.9% chronic CI but lacked strict diagnostic criteria. Autoimmune markers have been observed, with 71% of 18 patients with chronic CI having at least one positive serum marker on a standard IBD diagnostic panel, and in an older-onset cohort, 75% of 81 patients > 50 years old with new colitis symptoms had CI by predefined criteria. Methodologic concerns include inclusion of patients within 2 weeks of initial symptom onset in one study.

Bloody stools are not an expected manifestation of infection with C. difficile. STEC O157 should be assessed by culture and non-O157 STEC should be detected by Shiga toxin or genomic assays; Sorbitol-MacConkey agar or an appropriate chromogenic agar alternative is recommended to screen for O157:H7 STEC; detection of Shiga toxin is needed to detect other STEC serotype.

Rationale for best practice statements — history taking for gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in COVID-19. In outpatients with new-onset diarrhea, ascertain information about high-risk contact exposure; obtain a detailed history of symptoms associated with COVID-19, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, or new loss of taste or smell; and obtain a thorough history for other GI symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. In outpatients with new-onset GI symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), monitor for symptoms associated with COVID-19, as GI symptoms may precede COVID-related symptoms by a few days, and in a high COVID-19 prevalence setting, COVID-19 testing should be considered. In hospitalized patients with suspected or known COVID-19, obtain a thorough history of GI symptoms (ie, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), including onset, characteristics, duration, and severity.

IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME

Irritable bowel syndrome is the most common cause of diarrhea in the developed world, with an estimated prevalence in the United States of 4% to 9%, based on Rome III/IV criteria. Although patients can present with IBS at any age, it is most common in women aged 20 to 40 years, with women being diagnosed about twice as often as men (14% vs. 8.9%).

According to Rome IV clinical criteria, IBS may be diagnosed if abdominal pain is present at least 1 day per week, is associated with changes in visceral perception with defecation and/or alterations in stool form/frequency, and the symptoms affect patients' quality of life or their abilities to carry out normal activities of daily living. While these clinical criteria do not require symptoms to be present for a specific period of time, the practitioner must be confident that other diagnoses have been appropriately excluded. The Rome IV research-based criteria are more stringent, requiring symptoms to be present for the previous 3 months with onset > 6 months before diagnosis (Table 1). Symptoms not included in the definition of IBS-D, but commonly identified at presentation, include abdominal bloating and/or distension, fecal urgency, sensations of incomplete evacuation, and the passage of mucus in stools. Stools are characteristically watery (Bristol Stool Form Scale 6–7, Fig. 1) and passed during waking hours. Stress is a well-known mediator. Importantly, the development of symptoms in those older than 50 years, unintentional weight loss, acute unexplained symptom changes, recurrent bleeding and/or anemia, and a family history of inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, or colorectal cancer are considered alarm features or 'red flags' necessitating further diagnostic evaluation for organic causes other than IBS (Figs. 2 and 3).

SELF-MANAGEMENT OF FACP

Recommendations:

Self-management of FACP using over-the-counter products is appropriate for many patients with mild, nonpersistent symptoms.
To enable better self-care, patients and pharmacists require education and information on signs and symptoms to be aware of, and which treatments to use.

Comments

Self-care of gastrointestinal symptoms that impact quality of life, but which are not associated with a significant impairment in a person's ability to carry out daily activities and are not associated with obvious symptoms of structural disease, is commonplace. Rates of health care seeking, self-care (over-the-counter drug use), and overall medication use among patients with symptoms of FACP do, nevertheless, vary across countries and regions. For example, greater use of medications for managing FACP (comprising mainly over-the-counter products) has been reported in the United States and Latin America than in Europe (90% vs. 72%, respectively). Reasons for preferring self-management approaches among patients with FACP may include cultural differences in the perception of and response to symptoms, and limitations in access to drugs and physician care.

Self-management of FACP typically involves the use of over-the-counter pharmaceuticals and/or nonpharmacologic products, with or without consultation with a pharmacist. As self-management of FACP is so common, particularly on first presentation of symptoms, both patients and pharmacists require education and information on signs and symptoms to be aware of (including red flags that may necessitate a health care consultation) and which treatments to use, which will vary depending on local practice and preferences, and product availability.

Case Presentation

The patient was a 28 year old Asian Indian female of non-consanguineous parents who presented with a 3 year history of non-bloody diarrhea with abdominal cramping. Past medical history was significant for hepatitis A. She denied alcohol or tobacco use, had no chronic medical conditions, was not on any medications including gut irritants such as aspirin/non-steroidials and did not have a history of travel prior to onset of symptoms. Her last travel was to India one year prior to presentation, but she did not report any alleviation or exacerbation of her symptos with the travel/dietary/environmental change. She weighed 81 pounds at presentation. Stool cultures were negative for pathogens. Basic labs, including the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were normal, but liver function tests (LFTs) were elevated (Table 1). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed hepatic hypodensities and mesenteric adenopathy. Serology was negative for anti-nuclear (ANA) and anti-smooth muscle antibodies as well as antibodies for cytosolic anti-neutrophil cytoplasm (cANCA), liver-kidney microsomes, liver cytosolic and soluble liver-pancreas antigen. However, pANCA was positive (titer: > 1:20) and she had hyper-gammaglobulinemia (IgG: 2358 (630–1580 mg/dl), IgA: 578 (100–400 mg/dl), IgM: 134 (37–247 mg/dl).

Bloody stools are not an expected manifestation of infection with C. difficile. STEC O157 should be assessed by culture and non-O157 STEC should be detected by Shiga toxin or genomic assays (strong, low). Sorbitol-MacConkey agar or an appropriate chromogenic agar alternative is recommended to screen for O157:H7 STEC; detection of Shiga toxin is needed to detect other STEC serotype (strong, moderate).

### Effects and clinical significance of GII.4 sydney norovirus, United States, 2012–2013 [^114zeV5d]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Most outbreaks attributed to the GII.4 Sydney strain occurred in healthcare–related settings and were predominantly transmitted from person to person; these findings were similar to previous data for outbreaks attributed to other GII.4 NoV strains. This finding could be caused by age-associated biologic difference in virus infectivity, other virus and host-related factors, or relatively better outbreak reporting in long-term care facilities than in other settings. Additional studies are needed to better define the basis for this observed difference.

Although aggregate patient data were available for less than half of the outbreaks and primarily from those that occurred earlier in the season, some preliminary trends in the affected populations and clinical profiles were observed. GII.4 Sydney outbreaks disproportionally affected older persons, consistent with the observed predilection toward long-term care facilities. Patients affected by GII.4 Sydney were more likely to have diarrheal illness and less likely to have vomiting, fever, and abdominal cramps. Age-associated patterns of illness may explain this observation; however, it differs from a previous study that concluded that vomiting, fever, and abdominal cramps are more prevalent in patients infected with GII.4 NoV strains than those infected with non–GII.4 strains. We found higher rates of outpatient visits among patients infected with the GII.4 Sydney strain than among those infected with strains other than GII.4 Sydney, most of whom were infected with non-GII.4 strains. This finding is consistent with the previously reported association between GII.4 strains and severe outcomes. However, since hospitalization and emergency department visits occurred at similar rates, and given the difference in age of patients in GII.4 Sydney and non–GII.4 Sydney outbreaks, we were unable to associate GII.4 Sydney with differences in clinical severity.

### Consider hereditary angioedema in the differential diagnosis for unexplained recurring abdominal pain [^1173vdMQ]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

TABLE 2
Gastrointestinal Disorders That Overlap the Abdominal Symptoms of HAE

Episodic abdominal pain; recurrent small bowel obstruction without a surgical history and no clear etiology; or nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea with complete resolution between episodes warrant consideration of HAE as part of the differential diagnosis. Pertinent history may include recurrent episodes of cutaneous angioedema without pruritus and urticaria. Factors to consider in recognizing HAE in patients with GI symptoms are summarized in Table 3. Although most HAE attacks have no identifiable trigger, in females, HAE attacks may be brought on by normal hormonal fluctuations or the use of medications such as estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. In HAE, recurrent abdominal pain may vary in severity but typically occurs as severe intermittent episodes lasting 2 to 5 days if untreated, with normal asymptomatic periods between attacks. Abdominal pain in HAE is often described as cramping, colicky, tiring, or exhausting. During an attack, patients may have abdominal distension, tenderness, and possibly ascites. Ascites was detected in 92% of HAE patients who underwent abdominal ultrasound during an abdominal HAE attack. In our clinical experience, fever, peritoneal signs, or elevated white blood cell counts are not common during HAE attacks. These signs and symptoms would be more common with an acute abdominal pathology or familial Mediterranean fever. Elevated neutrophil counts (without increased bands), hypovolemia from fluid losses, and hemoconcentration have been reported in severe attacks. Nonresponse to glucocorticoids, antihistamines, or epinephrine is an additional indication that a mechanism other than histamine-mediated angioedema is involved.

### An adult case with shigellosis-associated encephalopathy [^113jQJJN]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Shigellosis is a common disease worldwide. It causes bloody stool with mucus, together with fever and abdominal cramps. The Shigella bacillus was discovered by the Japanese doctor Kiyoshi Shiga in the early 20th century (figure 1). Shigella spp cause almost 200 million infections per year in children under the age of 5 years. In the Netherlands, with a population of almost 17 million, there are between 300 and 500 infections with Shigella spp annually, of which 60% after recent travel.

Figure 1
Dr Kiyoshi Shiga. Source:

A known complication among children is Shigella encephalopathy. It can present with altered consciousness, seizures and coma. All the known Shigella spp (Shigella sonnei, Shigella flexneri, Shigella dysenteriae and Shigella boydii) can cause this complication, with a prevalence of 12%–45% in children. A lethal toxic encephalopathy with rapid onset of neurological abnormalities and only a mild colitis is known as the Ekiri syndrome.

Humans are the only host for Shigella spp. It is mostly contracted via the faecal–oral route with a low infectious dose. Shigella infections in the Western world are usually associated with travel to endemic countries. Recently, there are increasing reports of cases in men who have sex with men (MSM) without reported history of travel. The rising incidence in this population has the potential to cause outbreaks of Shigella infections in low-risk regions.

Here, we present a case of an adult with Shigella- associated encephalopathy in an MSM.

### Characteristics and risk factors of post-infection irritable bowel syndrome after Campylobacter enteritis [^116pqcrw]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Campylobacter is the leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in the United States. We investigated the prevalence of postinfection irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) in a cohort with culture-confirmed Campylobacter cases; risk factors for PI-IBS based on clinical factors; and shifts in IBS patterns postinfection in patients with pre-existing IBS.

Methods

The Minnesota Department of Health collects data on symptoms and exposures upon notification of Campylobacter cases. From 2011 through 2019, we sent surveys (the Rome III and IBS symptom severity surveys) to 3586 patients 6 to 9 months after Campylobacter infection. The prevalence of PI-IBS was estimated and risk factors were assessed using multivariable logistic regression.

Results

There were 1667 responders to the survey, 249 of whom had pre-existing IBS. Of the 1418 responders without pre-existing IBS, 301 (21%) subsequently developed IBS. Most of these individuals had IBS-mixed (54%), followed by IBS-diarrhea (38%), and IBS-constipation (6%). The mean IBS symptom severity score was 218 (indicating moderate severity). Female sex, younger age, bloody stools, abdominal cramps, and hospitalization during acute enteritis were associated with increased risk, whereas fever was protective for the development of PI-IBS. Antibiotic use and exposure patterns were similar between PI-IBS and control groups. Among patients with IBS-mixed or IBS-diarrhea before infection, 78% retained their subtypes after infection. In contrast, only 50% of patients with IBS-constipation retained that subtype after infection, whereas 40% transitioned to IBS-mixed. Of patients with pre-existing IBS, 38% had increased frequency of abdominal pain after Campylobacter infection.

Conclusions

In a cohort of patients with Campylobacter infection in Minnesota, 21% developed PI-IBS; most cases reported mixed IBS or diarrhea of moderate severity. Demographic and clinical factors during acute enterocolitis are associated with PI-IBS development. Campylobacter infection also can result in a switch of a pre-existing IBS phenotype.

### Small intestinal mucosal injury and its risk factors in patients with gastrointestinal cancer who developed complicated fluoropyrimidine-induced diarrhea [^112GLyFz]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Evaluation and management of diarrhea

Diarrhea severity was classified according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4. This includes: Grade 1, an increase of < 4 stools per day over baseline or a mild increase in ostomy output compared to baseline; Grade 2, an increase of 4–6 stools per day over baseline or a moderate increase in ostomy output compared to baseline associated with limited impact on activities of daily living (ADL); Grade 3, an increase of ≥ 7 stools per day over baseline requiring hospitalization or a severe increase in ostomy output compared to baseline associated with significant limitations with respect to self-care ADL; Grade 4, life-threatening condition requiring urgent intervention; Grade 5, death. Complicated diarrhea was defined according to the following American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines: CTCAE grade 3 or 4 diarrhea or grade 1 or 2 diarrhea with one or more additional signs or symptoms, including cramping, nausea/vomiting (grade 2 or more), decreased performance status, fever, sepsis, neutropenia, frank bleeding, and dehydration. Uncomplicated diarrhea was defined as grade 1 or 2 diarrhea with no complicating symptoms. Cramping associated with CID was defined as any case in which this symptom developed together with CID.

All patients diagnosed with complicated diarrhea were admitted to the hospital, and their chemotherapy was discontinued. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan was performed as needed, and bowel wall thickening was defined as demonstration of the bowel wall of more than 4 mm in thickness and over more than 30 mm in length. To distinguish between infectious and CID diarrhea, stool cultures (for Clostridium difficile, Escherichia coli, and other infectious agents that cause colitis), complete blood count, electrolyte panel, and CT scans were performed in patients who developed complicated diarrhea. Intravenous fluid and antibiotics were administered until all symptoms had resolved.

### Gastrointestinal manifestations, diagnosis, and management of hereditary angioedema [^113P6HTS]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is one of the most common conditions in clinical practice and yet a challenging complaint to accurately diagnose due to the vast number of possible etiologies. When other health care providers cannot identify the cause of abdominal pain, gastroenterologists are often looked upon to help solve the diagnostic dilemma. Consequently, it is incumbent upon gastroenterologists to be well versed in the diagnosis and management of not only common but also rare causes of abdominal pain. One such uncommon but well-described cause of abdominal pain is angioedema of the intestinal tract due to hereditary angioedema. Acute onset, recurrent abdominal pain of varying severity is its most common presenting symptom, and misdiagnosis can not only lead to unnecessary surgical procedures but also death. The purpose of this review is to raise awareness among gastroenterologists about hereditary angioedema as a potential cause of recurrent, unexplained abdominal pain.

### Consider hereditary angioedema in the differential diagnosis for unexplained recurring abdominal pain [^112JX6EG]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF HAE

Although HAE symptoms generally begin in childhood, the average age at HAE diagnosis ranges from early childhoodand early adulthoodto the early 40s after a long diagnostic delay. Although HAE should occur in both male and female patients in similar proportions, owing to the autosomal dominance of the disease, it seems to be a female-predominant disease, which may reflect the symptom-exacerbating effects of estrogen. Estrogen can activate factor XII conversion to factor XIIa, which can activate the kallikrein pathway, leading to increased bradykinin production. Clinical studies and case reports have indicated that female patients are affected by HAE more severely and experience HAE attacks with greater frequency than male patients.–As a female patient reaches puberty and experiences menstruation, ovulation, pregnancy, and menopause, the severity and frequency of attacks may change owing to normal fluctuations in estrogen. Menstruation, ovulation, estrogen-containing contraceptive use, and estrogen replacement in menopause have all been individually reported to trigger HAE attacks.

Involvement of the GI tract with resultant abdominal pain occurs in 43% to 93% of patients with HAE, and up to 80% of all patients have recurrent abdominal pain. In a study of 149 patients with HAE who experienced 521 HAE attacks with any abdominal symptoms, 49% of the attacks were characterized by isolated abdominal pain. In an additional 33% of the attacks, patients had abdominal pain and symptoms at 1 other location outside of the abdomen. The most common abdominal symptoms were distension (77%), cramping (73%), and nausea (67%), whereas vomiting (21%) and diarrhea (14%) were much less common. However, other studies have reported much higher rates of vomiting (78%) and diarrhea (65%) in patients with abdominal symptoms of HAE.

### Functional diarrhea [^116UGKP7]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic diarrhea is a frequent and challenging problem in clinical medicine. In a considerable subgroup of these, no underlying cause is identified and this is referred to as functional diarrhea. A consensus definition for functional diarrhea is based on loose stool consistency and chronicity and absence of coexisting irritable bowel syndrome. Underlying pathophysiology includes rapid intestinal transit, which may be worsened by stress or be triggered by a preceding infectious gastroenteritis. Diagnostic work-up aims at exclusion of underlying organic disease. Treatment starts with dietary adjustments, aiming at decreasing nutrients that enhance transit and stool and at identifying precipitating food items.

### Small intestinal mucosal injury and its risk factors in patients with gastrointestinal cancer who developed complicated fluoropyrimidine-induced diarrhea [^116sjVQU]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

While earlier studies conducted in mice models have established the microscopic features of gastrointestinal mucositis in 5-FU toxicity, recent reports have shown NF-κB and IL-4 to be critical mediators in this process. In fact, ileal biopsy with colonoscopy in patients with 5-FU-induced diarrhea revealed marked acute and chronic inflammation, which might correspond with the pathophysiology of fluoropyrimidine in rodent models. However, the extent and severity of this damage has yet to be studied in detail given that a considerable portion of the small intestine is beyond the reach of a colonoscope. Two recent studies evaluated the small intestinal mucosa of patients receiving chemotherapy. Accordingly, after performing CE in only those with diarrhea grades 0–2, both studies revealed that diarrhea grade was significantly correlated with the percentage of patients with intestinal mucosal injury. In contrast, the present study found a high incidence of mucosal injury regardless of diarrhea severity, perhaps because our endoscopic study targeted patients with complicated diarrhea, which includes both diarrhea severity and clinical factors. This finding suggests that complicating symptoms reflect chronic inflammation induced by fluoropyrimidine even among patients with grade 1 diarrhea. By contrast, no abnormal findings were detected in five patients undergoing fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy who did not develop diarrhea, although the patient cohorts were not background-matched. Therefore, these findings suggest fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy induced mucosal injury of small intestine, and assessing symptoms, such as fever, and cramping, are important for the management CID based on our endoscopic findings.

### Risk of inflammatory bowel disease following a diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome [^115NGLMs]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

In addition to the association between IBS and IBD, we found an increased incidence of IGE among our IBS cohort, compared to subjects without IBS. While the risk of IBS following IGE, termed post-infectious IBS (PI-IBS), has been well documented, to our knowledge, this is the first report of increased IGE risk in subjects with IBS. DuPont et al. reported a worsening of functional GI symptoms following an episode of travelers' diarrhea (TD) in subjects with IBS. However, the authors did not assess whether the risk of TD was higher among those with IBS. We were limited in our assessment of infectious gastroenteritis (IGE) to only episodes associated with a medical encounter, and it has been well-established that only a small proportion of IGE episodes actually seek medical care. Therefore, it is possible that the observation of an increased rate of IGE in the IBS cohort may be related to the fact that those subjects were more likely to seek care for an incident IGE episode than their non-IBS counterparts. Thus, this observation may be solely due to differences in care seeking behavior or differences in the severity of diarrheal and non-diarrheal symptoms such as abdominal pain or cramps, nausea, malaise or myalgia. In an effort to evaluate differences in the care seeking behavior in our 2 study populations, we analyzed the number of inpatient and outpatient medical encounters and found that after removing IBS- and IBD-associated visits, IBS subjects were more likely (p < 0.001) to present for medical care (median number of outpatient visits: 49; IQR: 20, 89) than were the non-IBS comparator cohort (median: 29; IQR: 14, 56). An alternative explanation is that due to the common clinical features, IBS symptoms may have been misdiagnosed as being of infectious etiology. Unfortunately, inadequate sample collection and microbiology is commonplace with infectious gastroenteritis, so we are unable to assess this potential bias.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: expert practical guidance [^117DVFSv]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Functional abdominal cramping pain (FACP) is frequently encountered in the general population. It may present either on its own or in association with a functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID; also known as a disorder of gut-brain interaction), such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional dyspepsia, and biliary pain. Although national and international guidelines exist for managing the symptoms of IBS, including the abdominal pain,–recommendations for the general diagnosis and symptomatic management of FACP are lacking.

The lack of guidance on how to diagnose and manage FACP reflects the absence of a standard, accepted definition, and limited focused literature on this complaint. The Rome Foundation has developed and updated its own criteria, currently up to Rome IV, to diagnose FGIDs, including those associated with FACP, such as IBS, functional dyspepsia, biliary pain, postprandial distress syndrome, epigastric pain syndrome, and narcotic bowel syndrome (also referred to as opioid-induced gastrointestinal hyperalgesia). However, although the Rome criteria are a useful tool for gastroenterologists and researchers, they do not fully capture the presentation of FACP seen in everyday practice, nor are they practical enough to be used routinely by primary care physicians (PCPs)/general practitioners (GPs), pharmacists, or patients, whose primary objective — once structural, organic causation has been ruled out — is symptom alleviation. The present expert guidance attempts to address these issues by providing a consensus definition for FACP and by presenting recommendations for its diagnosis and clinical management, with a focus on primary care and self-management. To complement these recommendations, practical, easy-to-use algorithms have been constructed to aid physicians, pharmacists, and patients themselves in identifying and managing FACP.

### Recent insights into reverse genetics of norovirus [^113uAcLk]. Virus Research (2023). Medium credibility.

1.1 Norovirus biology

Norovirus is predominant etiological agent of non-bacterial gastroenteritis and is associated with approximately one in five cases of all gastroenteritis worldwide. Transmission of norovirus is primarily through the consumption of contaminated food or water as well as by aerosolization. Norovirus is highly contagious and individuals at all ages are vulnerable, especially in immunocompromised populations, where infection may lead to severe clinical outcomes. People infected with norovirus usually have a rapid onset of symptoms, including diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, low-grade fever and abdominal cramps. At a global level, norovirus is responsible for an estimated 685 million diarrheal episodes and 212,000 deaths every year.

Norovirus is an RNA virus in the family Caliciviridae, which is characterized by rapid transmission and frequent genome mutation. Norovirus particles are small (27–40 nm in diameter) and nonenveloped that possess a single-stranded, (+) sense genomic RNA of ∼7.5–7.7 kb in length (Fig. 1 A). Its genome generally includes three open reading frames (ORFs), except for murine norovirus containing four ORFs (Fig. 1 B and C). ORF1 encodes a precursor polyprotein that is then hydrolyzed and cleaved by a protease (NS6) into six non-structural proteins (NS1/2 to NS7). ORF2 encodes the major structural protein (VP1), which is responsible for the viral capsid and can exist in up to 180 copies in the viral particle. VP1 has a shell (S) domain and a protruding (P) domain, with the S domain surrounding the viral RNA and connecting to the P domain by a flexible hinge. The P domain can be subdivided into P1 and P2 subdomains. P2 is the key region involved in immunogenicity, which is in the outermost layer of VP1 and enables to recognize histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs). As initial attachment factor, HBGAs are closely associated with genetic susceptibility for human norovirus infection, and bile acids functions as a cofactor to enhance HBGA binding for certain norovirus genotypes. Based on the diversity of amino acid (aa) coding sequences of VP1, norovirus is divided into 10 genogroups (GI-GX) and almost 50 genotypes. GI, GII, GIV, GVIII, and GIX are known to be the main genotypic groups infecting humans. ORF3 encodes the minor structural protein (VP2), which is located inside the virus and is involved in capsid assembly and genome encapsulation.

### Effects of bacteria on the enteric nervous system: implications for the irritable bowel syndrome [^115efqnU]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

A unified scenario emerges when it is considered that a major impact of stress on the intestinal tract is reflected by symptoms reminiscent of the diarrhea-predominant form of irritable bowel syndrome. Cramping abdominal pain, fecal urgency, and explosive watery diarrhea are hallmarks not only of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, but also of infectious enteritis, radiation-induced enteritis, and food allergy. The scenario starts with stress-induced compromise of the intestinal mucosal barrier and continues with microorganisms or other sensitizing agents crossing the barrier and being intercepted by enteric mast cells. Mast cells signal the presence of the agent to the enteric nervous system (ie, the brain-in-the-gut), which uses one of the specialized programs from its library of programs to remove the "threat". This is accomplished by stimulating mucosal secretion, which flushes the threatening agent into the lumen and maintains it in suspension. The secretory response then becomes linked to powerful propulsive motility, which propels the secretions together with the offending agent rapidly in the anal direction. Cramping abdominal pain accompanies the strong propulsive contractions. Urgency is experienced when arrival of the large bolus of liquid distends the recto-sigmoid region and reflexly opens the internal anal sphincter, with continence protection now provided only by central reflexes that contract the puborectalis and external anal sphincter muscles. Sensory information arriving in the brain from receptors in the rapidly distending recto-sigmoid accounts for the conscious sensation of urgency and might exacerbate the individual's emotional stress. The symptom of explosive watery diarrhea becomes self-explanatory in this scenario.

### Effects of teduglutide on diarrhea in pediatric patients with short bowel syndrome-associated intestinal failure [^113tG76m]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

In this study, the patients' remnant small intestinal length, a prognostic factor previously associated with spontaneous intestinal adaptation, did not have a significant impact on patient stool consistency. Improvement in stool consistency is especially important for patients with SBS-IF, as they experience chronic, lifestyle-altering symptoms of malabsorption that can lead to a significant reduction in their quality of life. As an intestinotrophic growth factor that binds GLP-2 receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, a GLP-2 receptor agonist such as teduglutide can theoretically address pathophysiologic factors in SBS-associated diarrhea by slowing gastric emptying, reducing gastric secretions, enhancing mucosal barrier function, increasing intestinal blood flow, and stimulating growth of the gastrointestinal epithelium, including increasing crypt depth and villus height. Other factors, such as microbiota dysbiosis and bile acid malabsorption, are also likely to play an important role. Further studies may help better characterize the full spectrum of SBS-associated diarrhea symptoms, such as tenesmus, nocturnal defecation, frequency, fecal incontinence, and abdominal cramping.

### Diverticular disease as a chronic illness: evolving epidemiologic and clinical insights [^117U14mP]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Diverticular disease imposes a significant burden on Western and industrialized societies. The traditional pathogenesis model posits that low dietary fiber predisposes to diverticulosis, and fecalith obstruction prompts acute diverticulitis that is managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics or surgery. However, a growing body of knowledge is shifting the paradigm of diverticular disease from an acute surgical illness to a chronic bowel disorder composed of recurrent abdominal symptoms and considerable psychosocial impact. New research implicates a role for low-grade inflammation, sensory-motor nerve damage, and dysbiosis in a clinical picture that mimics irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and even inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Far from being an isolated event, acute diverticulitis may be the catalyst for chronic symptoms including abdominal pain, cramping, bloating, diarrhea, constipation, and "post-diverticulitis IBS". In addition, studies reveal lower health-related quality of life in patients with chronic diverticular disease vs. controls. Health-care providers should maintain a high index of suspicion for the multifaceted presentations of diverticular disease, and remain aware that it might contribute to long-term emotional distress beyond traditional diverticulitis attacks. These developments are prompting a shift in therapeutic approaches from widespread antimicrobials and supportive care to the use of probiotics, mesalamine, and gut-directed antibiotics. This review addresses the emerging literature regarding epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management of chronic, symptomatic diverticular disease, and provides current answers to common clinical questions.

Background

Infection with E.coli 0157 can present with a variety of symptoms including bloody diarrhoea and abdominal cramps. The bacterium is commonly transferred by a feco-oral route and undercooked meat is a known culprit. This infection is linked to Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) which presents with the triad of progressive renal failure, thrombocytopenia and haemolytic anaemia. HUS can be classified as either typical (diarrhoea associated) or atypical (non-diarrhoea associated such as following a urinary tract infection). We present a case of a 17-year-old male with bloody diarrhoea who proceeded to be affected by severe HUS including neurological sequalae. Our case highlights the difficulties in establishing a diagnosis and treatment when a patient presents with bloody diarrhoea.

### Diagnosing the patient with abdominal pain and altered bowel habits: is it irritable bowel syndrome? [^1116jvCm]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Diagnosing a patient who presents with abdominal pain and altered bowel habits can be challenging. Although serious organic illnesses can cause these symptoms, irritable bowel syndrome is commonly responsible. It can be difficult to properly evaluate these patients without overusing diagnostic tests and consultation. A practical approach for diagnosing irritable bowel syndrome is suggested, using the Rome II criteria and the presence of alarm symptoms such as weight loss, gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, fever, or frequent nocturnal symptoms as starting points. If there are no alarm symptoms and the Rome II criteria are not met, it is acceptable to reevaluate the patient at a later date. If there are no alarm symptoms and the Rome II criteria are met, the patient should be categorized on the basis of age: patients 50 years or younger can be evaluated on the basis of predominant symptoms — constipation, diarrhea, or abdominal pain. Patients older than 50 years should be fully evaluated and considered for gastroenterology referral. If alarm symptoms are present, a full evaluation should be performed (and gastroenterology referral considered), regardless of the patient's age.

### 2017 WSES guidelines for the management of iatrogenic colonoscopy perforation [^116QhL6j]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Which are the minimum biochemical and imaging investigations that should be requested in the case of a suspected ICP?

A delay in the diagnosis of ICP is a critical issue for therapeutic outcomes; when the diagnosis is delayed more than 24 h, the chance increases that more invasive treatments (e.g. surgery) will be required. Physicians should therefore search for this potentially life-threatening complication and run clinical and biochemical tests if an ICP is suspected.

An ICP can be appreciated by direct visualization of the parietal defect or the view of intra-abdominal tissues through the colonic wall during the endoscopy. Otherwise, the diagnosis of ICP is based on clinical, laboratory, and radiologic findings. The clinical presentation of an ICP can vary widely, depending on the size of the perforation, the type of etiologic agent, the affected colonic location, the degree of intra-peritoneal contamination, and the patient's general status. In the majority of patients (91–92%), symptoms develop within the first 48 h following the completion of the endoscopy. The most common symptom is abdominal pain associated with distension, although painless cases of ICP or cases with severe cramp-like pain have been described. In two large clinical series, the most consistent symptoms were abdominal pain (from 74 to 95%), guarding/rebound tenderness (82.5) with diffuse peritonitis, tachycardia (62.5%), leukocytosis (40%), fever (38%), rectal bleeding (15%), and isolated abdominal distension (6.6%). Only a small number of patients with ICP (5%) remained asymptomatic. An unusual clinical sign (1/55 patients with ICPs) was a delayed subcutaneous emphysema and an ongoing necrotizing infection of the abdominal wall. It is a common belief that patients with diffuse peritonitis can be diagnosed and treated for perforation on a clinical basis, but peritonitis-like clinical scenarios can also occur in the absence of perforation. For instance, a transmural thermal injury after polypectomy with serosal irritation without any obvious perforation produces localized peritonitis that is amenable to non-operative management. Thus, biochemical and imaging studies are always indicated when an ICP is suspected.

### Functional abdominal pain: time to get together and move forward [^116i2Awn]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2008). Medium credibility.

Intestinal motility and abdominal pain in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) involve strong contractions of the intestinal circular muscle causing intestinal power propulsion that underlie the sensation of cramping abdominal pain, and power propulsion occurs more frequently in patients with IBS than in healthy subjects with contractions significantly stronger than normal. Moreover, postprandial power propulsion is more prevalent in the colons of patients with IBS than in normal individuals and is often associated with their diarrheal state. The pain and discomfort of patients with IBS during powerful contractions may be explained in 3 ways, either separately or in combination: exceptionally powerful contractions activating high-threshold mechanoreceptors; mechanoreceptor sensitization with erroneously coded input to spinal and brain processing centers; and accurately coded spinal afferent information misinterpreted in the spinal cord and central processing centers of the brain.

### Acquired acrodermatitis enteropathica as a presenting sign of celiac disease [^115df2FH]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

The rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder AE results from a zinc transporter protein (ZIP4) loss of function mutation encoded by the SLC39A4 gene on chromosome 9. As part of the regulatory system for zinc homeostasis, ZIP4 enables intracellular zinc transport from the lumen of the small intestine and, when absent, leads to systemic zinc deficiency. Periorificial and acral dermatitis, alopecia, and diarrhea in association with epidermal necrosis on histology point to the diagnosis. Although most literature on zinc deficiency dermatitis focuses on this heritable variant and its presentation in young children, a variety of scenarios producing acquired zinc deficiency in adulthood manifest similar clinicopathologic findings. Anorexia nervosa, alcoholism, intestinal malabsorption, and diets high in mineral binding phytate are the most common causes of acquired acrodermatitis enteropathica. Low zinc intake also results in zinc deficiency; however, the recommended daily intake of 8 mg for women and 11 mg for men is easily attained in developed countries. Dietary zinc deficiency must not be completely overlooked, as the extensive use of proton-pump inhibitors, decreased consumption of meat and fish, and diets abundant in phytate-rich foods are not uncommon.

As zinc interacts with a multitude of molecular structures, it is not surprising that cellular and systemic zinc levels are tightly regulated. Of the anatomic sites involved in zinc homeostasis, including the kidneys, skin, and sites of tissue repair, the small intestine is thought to be the central avenue for homeostasis. Thus, acrodermatitis enteropathica may develop when gastrointestinal pathologies decrease the absorption of zinc across the luminal membrane of the small intestine.

Celiac disease is a chronic gastrointestinal condition characterized by the inability to tolerate gliadin, the alcohol-soluble fraction of gluten. This results in an immunologically mediated inflammatory response to the ingestion of gluten and ultimately leads to damage of the intestinal mucosa with comorbid malabsorption. Common symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, flatulence, weight loss, growth delay in children, and fatigue. Diagnosis is determined with positive immunoglobulin A antitissue transglutaminase and antiendomysial antibodies — both of which were positive in our patient. Although small bowel biopsies are the gold standard to confirm gluten-sensitive enteropathy, classic findings are frequently patchy when taken from the distal duodenum. In contrast, literature supports the superior reliability of duodenal biopsies from the bulb, which were unfortunately not obtained in our patient.

### Diarrhea and malabsorption in the elderly [^111fwJPa]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Physicians who care for elderly patients should be alert to the possible presence of diarrhea and malabsorption. Older patients may not admit to having chronic diarrhea, particularly if they also are incontinent. If diarrhea is of short duration, an infectious cause is at least as common as in the young. Institutionalized elderly are particularly prone to gastrointestinal infections, but the manifestations may not be overt. When an intestinal infection and potential medication-induced gastrointestinal disturbances have been excluded, the differential diagnosis of diarrhea in the elderly is the same as in the young. Causes include intestinal malabsorption, even though diarrhea is a less common manifestation of malabsorption in the old than in younger patients. In the elderly, micronutrient deficiency is a common presenting clinical picture; because the symptoms of malabsorption are covert, the diagnosis often is delayed, and nutritional deficiencies are more common and more severe than in the young. Because the elderly have less nutritional reserve than the young, these deficiencies are clinically much more devastating in the elderly. Although the causes of malabsorption, as a whole, are similar in older and younger patients, chronic pancreatic insufficiency of unknown cause and intestinal bacterial overgrowth without an anatomic abnormality of the small intestine are syndromes that are specific to the elderly and must be considered in any older patient with unexplained weight loss or failure to thrive. Often, therapeutic trials are necessary to establish a potential diagnosis.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: expert practical guidance [^112ywSMS]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

In instances where an antispasmodic agent seems to be ineffective, and in the absence of an identified organic cause of FACP, it might be worthwhile to trial another antispasmodic with a different mechanism of action before attempting to introduce other treatment modalities. Although switching from 1 antispasmodic to another has not been evaluated, such trial and error seems justified if the pharmacology of the 2 agents is different. Further treatment options at this point may include the herbal medicinal products, peppermint oil or STW 5. Peppermint oil has antispasmodic properties and multiple clinical studies have shown that it can reduce abdominal pain in patients with IBS. Across Europe, peppermint oil is indicated as a "herbal medicinal product for the symptomatic relief of minor spasms of the gastrointestinal tract, flatulence and abdominal pain, especially in patients with IBS". Evidence supporting the clinical efficacy/effectiveness of another herbal treatment, STW 5, to reduce abdominal pain is also available, but the data are less compelling than for antispasmodics (including peppermint oil), and mainly derived from a small number of studies in IBS or functional dyspepsia.–Notably, rare cases of hepatoxicity leading to liver failure have been reported during STW 5 treatment, resulting a label change to exclude its use in individuals with liver disease, as well as in pregnant or breastfeeding women.

### Chronic diarrhea as the presenting feature of primary systemic AL amyloidosis: serendipity or delayed diagnosis? [^116JyEqD]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 43-year-old man developed watery diarrhea that gradually worsened over two years as well as progressive weight loss of 35 kg.

He had an average stool frequency of up to 6 to 8 times a day, with no obvious blood or mucus and no abdominal pain or tenesmus. He had no fever, night sweats, nausea, vomiting, hematochezia, or melena. Migrating tingling of both lower extremities was noticed one and a half years earlier. During the past two years, he had undergone both esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy twice with normal appearance of the GI mucosa. Biopsy of the intestine was not performed. Small bowel follow-through as well as abdominal computed tomography (CT) was unremarkable. In addition, an exploratory laparotomy was performed 1 year ago with no diagnostic findings. It is unknown whether in the previous period postural hypotension had been observed or not. And the presence of cardiomyopathy, sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy and micturition disorders were also not highlighted in previous medical referrals.

### Are herbal medicines ripe for the cancer clinic? [^115T5N9L]. Science Translational Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has become a core component of the daily challenges faced when treating cancer patients. PHY906 is a formulation of four herbal compounds traditionally used to treat nausea, vomiting, cramping, and diarrhea. Diarrhea is one of the major side effects of the cancer drug irinotecan. In this issue of Science Translational Medicine, Lam and colleagues report that administration of PHY906 with irinotecan in a mouse model of colon cancer resulted in a synergistic reduction in tumor burden, maintenance of body weight, and stem cell regeneration in the intestinal mucosa. Yet when considering CAM use in the treatment of cancer patients, one must take into account reproducibility of preclinical findings in clinical practice, quality assurance of herbal products, and potential toxicities associated with alternative therapies.

### Use of probiotics in the management of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea: a case study [^113KhuDc]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal disturbances (particularly diarrhea) are often induced in response to cancer treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation. Oral chemotherapeutic agents can induce diarrhea by damaging the intestinal lining. Two common oral drugs used in cancer treatment that are known to have gastrointestinal side effects are capecitabine and lapatinib. In this brief communication, the authors discuss a case study of a stage IV breast cancer patient whose chemotherapy-induced diarrhea was treated successfully with a multispecies combination of probiotics. This is a unique study in which grade 3 chemotherapy-induced diarrhea (characterized by 7–9 stools per day and associated with incontinence and abdominal cramping) was treated with only a multispecies combination of probiotics. Probiotics have been used to treat diarrhea in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, and Crohn's disease. More recently, probiotics have been used to treat chemotherapy-induced diarrhea in colon cancer patients. This case study demonstrates that the probiotics can also be used to treat severe cases of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea in breast cancer patients. The use of different probiotics in gastrointestinal diseases is an increasingly important area of study, and more research into this area is needed. This study demonstrates that probiotics should be considered for advanced breast cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced diarrhea.

### Diagnosis and management of IBS in adults [^112wgh25]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome is defined as abdominal discomfort or pain associated with altered bowel habits for at least three days per month in the previous three months, with the absence of organic disease. In North America, the prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome is 5 to 10 percent with peak prevalence from 20 to 39 years of age. Abdominal pain is the most common symptom and often is described as a cramping sensation. The absence of abdominal pain essentially excludes irritable bowel syndrome. Other common symptoms include diarrhea, constipation, or alternating diarrhea and constipation. The goals of treatment are symptom relief and improved quality of life. Exercise, antibiotics, antispasmodics, peppermint oil, and probiotics appear to improve symptoms. Over-the-counter laxatives and antidiarrheals may improve stool frequency but not pain. Treatment with antidepressants and psychological therapies are also effective for improving symptoms compared with usual care. Lubiprostone is effective for the treatment of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, and alosetron (restrictions for use apply in the United States) and tegaserod (available only for emergency use in the United States) are approved for patients with severe symptoms in whom conventional therapy has been ineffective.

### An unusual complication in ulcerative colitis during treatment with azathioprine and infliximab: isospora belli as' casus belli' [^114Ei79S]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

The treatment of ulcerative colitis is based on systemic corticosteroids, immunomodulators such as cyclosporine and azathioprine and TNF-α antagonists. Patients undergoing such immunosuppressive treatment are more susceptible for infectious pathogens. Here, we report the case of a patient with a 13-year history of ulcerative colitis, treated initially with systemic corticosteroids in combination with immunomodulators, and subsequently with infliximab. The patient presented with severe watery diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, weight loss and low-grade fever. Stool examinations for cytomegalovirus, bacteria and parasites were negative. Following detection of numerous oocytes of Isospora belli (IB) in direct smear preparations of the diarrhoeic stool samples, the patient was successfully treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole).

### Abdominal attacks and treatment in hereditary angioedema with C1-inhibitor deficiency [^114dcPkA]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, patients that present with attacks of recurrent abdominal pain that completely resolve in the absence of other symptoms are challenging to diagnose. The data from this study provide information that should aid the Gastroenterologist in suspecting the diagnosis of HAE in patients with such unexplained bouts of severe abdominal pain. Patients with HAE are likely to have intermittent exacerbations of moderate to severe, poorly localized pain, described as tender, tiring-or exhausting, aching cramping or sickening. Elevation of white blood cells frequently occurs during severe abdominal attacks and may lead to exploratory laparotomy for concern of other more common conditions. As Gastroenterologists increase their awareness of HAE, patients will be diagnosed earlier to receive both timely and effective treatment.

Consultative management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) gastrointestinal (GI) and liver issues — best practice statements are as follows: In outpatients with new-onset diarrhea, ascertain information about high-risk contact exposure; obtain a detailed history of symptoms associated with COVID-19, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, or new loss of taste or smell; and obtain a thorough history for other GI symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. In outpatients with new-onset GI symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), monitor for symptoms associated with COVID-19, as GI symptoms may precede COVID-related symptoms by a few days. In a high COVID-19 prevalence setting, COVID-19 testing should be considered. In hospitalized patients with suspected or known COVID-19, obtain a thorough history of GI symptoms (ie, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), including onset, characteristics, duration, and severity. There is presently inadequate evidence to support stool testing for diagnosis or monitoring of COVID-19 as part of routine clinical practice. In patients (outpatients or inpatients) with elevated LFTs in context of suspected or known COVID-19, evaluate for alternative etiologies. In hospitalized patients with suspected or known COVID-19, obtain baseline LFTs at the time of admission and consider LFT monitoring throughout the hospitalization, particularly in the context of drug treatment for COVID-19. In hospitalized patients undergoing drug treatment for COVID-19, evaluate for treatment-related GI and hepatic adverse effects.

INTRODUCTION

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder of gut-brain interaction characterized by abdominal pain and altered bowel movements. IBS is more common among women and in individuals younger than 50 years. IBS is classified according to the predominant bowel habit, namely, IBS with constipation (IBS-C), IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), or IBS with mixed bowel habits (IBS-M). As defined by the Rome diagnostic criteria, the estimated prevalence of IBS ranges from 4.8% (Rome IV) to 8.8% (Rome III) in the US adult population, with IBS-C accounting for approximately 16% (Rome IV) to 29% (Rome III) of these cases. The more stringent Rome IV diagnostic criteria may underestimate the true prevalence and clinical and economic impact of IBS.

Individuals with IBS-C have more bothersome, frequent, and widespread abdominal pain than those with other IBS subtypes. They also experience other abdominal symptoms, such as bloating, discomfort, cramping, and fullness. As the pathophysiology of IBS is multifactorial, the cause of these symptoms is not completely understood. However, nonclinical studies have found that visceral hypersensitivity and increased intestinal permeability have been linked to abdominal pain.

Abdominal symptoms are associated with substantial morbidity, increased use of healthcare resources, decreased work productivity, and compromised health-related quality of life. Although randomized placebo-controlled studies of polyethylene glycol and soluble fiber demonstrated improvement in bowel movements relative to placebo, they did not significantly relieve abdominal pain or discomfort. In an online survey of patients diagnosed with IBS-C, only 37% of those taking over-the-counter treatment were satisfied with their response.

### Evaluation and performance of a newly developed patient-reported outcome instrument for diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome in a clinical study population [^1146Cqcm]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort associated with altered bowel habits, including constipation, diarrhea, or both. Efforts to study the potential benefit of treatment of patients with IBS and diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) have been hindered by a lack of well validated symptom severity scales that meet current standards for patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments, and a reliable biologic marker for IBS. In turn, this presents a challenge for development of optimal study designs and endpoints for clinical trials assessing drug impact on IBS, thereby hindering development of drugs that provide benefit to patients.

A patient-reported instrument for IBS-D has recently been developed and validated, in line with the guidance from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with respect to development of both PROs and drugs to treat IBS. The instrument is a PRO measure that includes a seven-item IBS-D Daily Symptom Diary (hereafter referred to as the Diary), in which patients record the severity of symptoms over the previous 24 h, and a four-item IBS-D Symptom Event Log (hereafter referred to as the Event Log), which is completed following each bowel movement to assess information regarding individual bowel movements. The 'Diary' collects information on abdominal pain, stomach pain, abdominal cramps, abdominal bloating, frequency of gas and accidents; and the 'Event Log' on each individual bowel movement, the immediacy of need, and the consistency of the bowel movement. It was developed by a multidisciplinary research team for use as a clinical trial endpoint in IBS-D and its content validity was evaluated during development using five qualitative research studies. Evidence from another observational study supported an initial evaluation of the psychometric properties of the instrument.

Recurrent abdominal pain is a common reason for repeated visits to outpatient clinics and emergency departments, reflecting a substantial unmet need for timely and accurate diagnosis. A lack of awareness of some of the rarer causes of recurrent abdominal pain may impede diagnosis and delay effective management. This article identifies some of the key rare but diagnosable causes that are frequently missed by gastroenterologists and provides expert recommendations to support recognition, diagnosis, and management with the ultimate aim of improving patient outcomes.
