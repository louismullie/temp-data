## Question

MRSA/mssa decubitus ulcers (in immunosuppressed patients) duration of antibiotic treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy for MRSA or MSSA decubitus ulcers in immunosuppressed patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why decubitus ulcers differ from other SSTIs. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines say about duration for SSTIs and whether they carve out exceptions for pressure ulcers. Next, I will examine disease-specific guidance for chronic wounds and diabetic foot infections to see if there are analogous duration principles. After that, I need to check for any direct evidence on duration in decubitus ulcers and consider how immunosuppression modifies risk and duration decisions. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stewardship-aligned recommendation with monitoring checkpoints and caveats about source control and cultures.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why this is hard. Decubitus ulcers are chronic, often polymicrobial wounds with devitalized tissue where colonization and infection are difficult to distinguish; immunosuppression blunts local and systemic responses, so progression can be silent and slower to resolve, which complicates duration decisions and heightens the need for source control and close follow-up [^116v1N7C] [^113DCRdM] [^112ga77L].

> Wait, let me verify the highest-quality SSTI guidance on duration. The 2014 IDSA SSTI guideline recommends a baseline of 5 days for cellulitis, with extension if the patient is not improving, and explicitly notes that duration should be individualized to clinical response; this is a strong recommendation with high-quality evidence for uncomplicated cellulitis, but it does not directly address chronic pressure ulcers, so I should be cautious about extrapolation [^116PoWQe] [^115p3xNL].

> Next, I should review disease-specific guidance for chronic wounds to see if there is a consistent duration signal. The WSES/SIS-E consensus recommends 7–14 days for complicated SSTIs, individualizing to response, and supports IV-to-oral switch when stable; this aligns with a 7–14 day framework for chronic or complicated wounds, though it is not decubitus-specific [^115KeBek] [^111aNudS]. For diabetic foot infections, the IWGDF/IDSA 2023 guideline recommends 1–2 weeks of systemic therapy for soft tissue infection, again with extension only if infection persists; this is a strong recommendation with high-quality evidence and is the closest high-credibility analog for chronic wound infections [^116Nf3FQ].

> Hold on, I should verify whether any guideline directly addresses decubitus ulcers. I do not find a high-credibility guideline that specifies a fixed duration for infected pressure ulcers; instead, sources emphasize that infections are often polymicrobial, that source control via debridement is essential, and that antibiotics are indicated when there is spreading cellulitis, systemic illness, or immunocompromise, with therapy tailored to culture results and clinical response rather than a preset duration [^113DCRdM] [^116v1N7C].

> I need to check how immunosuppression changes the calculus. Immunocompromised hosts have higher risks of treatment failure, occult progression, and recurrence; therefore, even when using standard durations, I should maintain a lower threshold to extend therapy if the clinical trajectory is suboptimal and ensure close reassessment at 48–72 hours, consistent with IDSA's principle of extending therapy if there is no improvement by day 5 in cellulitis and with stewardship cautions in immunocompromised patients [^116PoWQe] [^112ga77L].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For immunosuppressed patients with MRSA or MSSA decubitus ulcers, a reasonable default is 10–14 days of targeted therapy, assuming adequate source control and clinical improvement; extend to 2–3 weeks if there is slow response, extensive tissue involvement, or persistent systemic features, and shorten to 7–10 days only if there is rapid, clear improvement with complete source control and no systemic signs. Throughout, tailor to culture results, de-escalate when possible, and reassess at 48–72 hours to decide on continuation or extension, mirroring the 7–14 day SSTI framework and the 1–2 week DFU evidence base [^115KeBek] [^116Nf3FQ] [^116PoWQe].

> But wait, what if the wound is colonized rather than truly infected. I should confirm infection with clinical signs such as spreading erythema, warmth, purulence, pain out of proportion, or systemic features; surface swabs are unreliable for identifying pathogens in chronic wounds, so if cultures are needed, obtain tissue from the base after debridement to guide therapy and avoid overtreatment of colonization [^116v1N7C] [^113DCRdM].

> I should double-check supportive care elements that influence duration. Adequate debridement, pressure offloading, moisture control, and optimization of nutrition and comorbidities are essential to achieve infection control and may shorten the need for antibiotics; conversely, failure of these measures predicts prolonged or recurrent infection and may justify longer courses with vigilant monitoring [^113DCRdM].

> Final recommendation: For immunosuppressed patients with MRSA or MSSA decubitus ulcers, use 10–14 days of targeted systemic therapy as a baseline, extend to 2–3 weeks if response is slow or complications persist, and shorten to 7–10 days only with rapid clinical resolution and assured source control; individualize to clinical response, culture data, and host factors, with reassessment at 48–72 hours to decide on continuation or extension, consistent with SSTI and chronic wound guidance [^115KeBek] [^116Nf3FQ] [^116PoWQe].

For immunosuppressed patients with MRSA/MSSA decubitus ulcers, **treat for 10–14 days** [^115KeBek] if there is clinical improvement, extending to 2–3 weeks if the response is slow or complications are present. Base duration on **clinical response**, culture results, and the extent of infection, and ensure **source control** with debridement and pressure relief [^113DCRdM]. Adjust therapy to culture and susceptibility data, and monitor closely for clinical deterioration or recurrence.

---

## General principles of antibiotic therapy

- **Source control**: Essential in managing infected decubitus ulcers; surgical debridement to remove necrotic tissue and relieve pressure are critical components of therapy [^113DCRdM].

- **Empiric therapy**: Initial antibiotic selection should consider local epidemiology, patient-specific risk factors, and severity of infection. MRSA coverage is recommended in patients with risk factors for MRSA or in settings with high MRSA prevalence [^111zAoE9] [^116nahUu].

- **Definitive therapy**: Antibiotic therapy should be tailored based on culture and susceptibility results to ensure targeted treatment [^116v1N7C].

---

## Recommended duration of antibiotic therapy

The **standard duration** of antibiotic therapy for MRSA/MSSA decubitus ulcers in immunosuppressed patients is 10–14 days [^115KeBek], provided there is clinical improvement and adequate source control. Extend therapy to 2–3 weeks for slow clinical response, extensive tissue involvement, or complications such as osteomyelitis or persistent infection [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing duration of therapy

Several factors influence the **duration of antibiotic therapy** in immunosuppressed patients with MRSA/MSSA decubitus ulcers:

| **Factor** | **Impact on duration** |
|-|-|
| Clinical response | Rapid improvement may allow shorter courses (7–10 days); slow response warrants extension to 2–3 weeks [^115KeBek] |
| Extent of infection | Deep tissue involvement or large ulcers may require prolonged therapy (2–3 weeks) [^notfound] |
| Presence of complications | Osteomyelitis, bacteremia, or persistent infection necessitate extended courses (4–6 weeks or longer) [^1131cRoq] |
| Patient-specific factors | Degree of immunosuppression, comorbidities, and response to therapy influence duration [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **IDSA guidelines**: Recommend 7–14 days of therapy for complicated skin and soft tissue infections, individualizing based on clinical response and patient factors [^115KeBek].

- **WSES/SIS-E guidelines**: Emphasize 7–14 days of therapy, with extension based on clinical response and presence of complications [^115KeBek].

- **Limited specific data**: There is limited high-quality evidence specifically addressing the duration of therapy for MRSA/MSSA decubitus ulcers in immunosuppressed patients, necessitating clinical judgment and individualized decision-making [^11421s67].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment of therapy

Regular clinical assessment is essential to ensure **adequate response** to therapy and to detect complications early. Obtain follow-up cultures if the patient fails to improve or if there is suspicion of persistent infection. Modify antibiotic therapy based on culture results, susceptibility data, and clinical response [^116v1N7C].

---

## Potential risks of prolonged antibiotic therapy

Prolonged antibiotic therapy carries risks, including:

- **Antibiotic resistance**: Increased risk of developing resistant organisms, including MRSA and other multidrug-resistant pathogens [^115hMWPJ].

- **Adverse effects**: Higher incidence of drug-related adverse effects, including nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and hematologic abnormalities [^117MdSXz].

- **Clostridioides difficile infection**: Increased risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea and colitis [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Standard duration**: 10–14 days for MRSA/MSSA decubitus ulcers in immunosuppressed patients with clinical improvement and adequate source control [^115KeBek].

- **Extended duration**: 2–3 weeks for slow clinical response, extensive tissue involvement, or complications.

- **Individualized approach**: Base duration on clinical response, culture results, and patient-specific factors [^116PoWQe].

- **Regular monitoring**: Continuously assess clinical response and adjust therapy accordingly [^116PoWQe].

---

The recommended duration of antibiotic therapy for MRSA/MSSA decubitus ulcers in immunosuppressed patients is **10–14 days**, with extension to 2–3 weeks based on clinical response and complications. Therapy should be individualized, with close monitoring and adjustment as needed.

### Antibiotic therapy for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in non surgical wounds [^116xfUbm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Non surgical wounds include chronic ulcers (pressure or decubitus ulcers, venous ulcers, diabetic ulcers, ischaemic ulcers), burns and traumatic wounds. The prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonisation (i.e. presence of MRSA in the absence of clinical features of infection such as redness or pus discharge) or infection in chronic ulcers varies between 7% and 30%. MRSA colonisation or infection of non surgical wounds can result in MRSA bacteraemia (infection of the blood) which is associated with a 30-day mortality of about 28% to 38% and a one-year mortality of about 55%. People with non surgical wounds colonised or infected with MRSA may be reservoirs of MRSA, so it is important to treat them, however, we do not know the optimal antibiotic regimen to use in these cases.

Objectives

To compare the benefits (such as decreased mortality and improved quality of life) and harms (such as adverse events related to antibiotic use) of all antibiotic treatments in people with non surgical wounds with established colonisation or infection caused by MRSA.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases: The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 13 March 2013); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 2); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (2013, Issue 2); NHS Economic Evaluation Database (2013, Issue 2); Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to February Week 4 2013); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, March 12, 2013); Ovid EMBASE (1974 to 2013 Week 10); EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 8 March 2013).

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotic treatment with no antibiotic treatment or with another antibiotic regimen for the treatment of MRSA-infected non surgical wounds. We included all relevant RCTs in the analysis, irrespective of language, publication status, publication year, or sample size.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently identified the trials, and extracted data from the trial reports. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for comparing the binary outcomes between the groups and planned to calculate the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for comparing the continuous outcomes. We planned to perform the meta-analysis using both fixed-effect and random-effects models. We performed intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible.

Main Results

We identified three trials that met the inclusion criteria for this review. In these, a total of 47 people with MRSA-positive diabetic foot infections were randomised to six different antibiotic regimens. While these trials included 925 people with multiple pathogens, they reported the information on outcomes for people with MRSA infections separately (MRSA prevalence: 5.1%). The only outcome reported for people with MRSA infection in these trials was the eradication of MRSA. The three trials did not report the review's primary outcomes (death and quality of life) and secondary outcomes (length of hospital stay, use of healthcare resources and time to complete wound healing). Two trials reported serious adverse events in people with infection due to any type of bacteria (i.e. not just MRSA infections), so the proportion of patients with serious adverse events was not available for MRSA-infected wounds. Overall, MRSA was eradicated in 31/47 (66%) of the people included in the three trials, but there were no significant differences in the proportion of people in whom MRSA was eradicated in any of the comparisons, as shown below.1. Daptomycin compared with vancomycin or semisynthetic penicillin: RR of MRSA eradication 1.13; 95% CI 0.56 to 2.25 (14 people).2. Ertapenem compared with piperacillin/tazobactam: RR of MRSA eradication 0.71; 95% CI 0.06 to 9.10 (10 people).3. Moxifloxacin compared with piperacillin/tazobactam followed by amoxycillin/clavulanate: RR of MRSA eradication 0.87; 95% CI 0.56 to 1.36 (23 people).

Authors' Conclusions

We found no trials comparing the use of antibiotics with no antibiotic for treating MRSA-colonised non-surgical wounds and therefore can draw no conclusions for this population. In the trials that compared different antibiotics for treating MRSA-infected non surgical wounds, there was no evidence that any one antibiotic was better than the others. Further well-designed RCTs are necessary.

Erysipelas and cellulitis — evaluation and treatment recommendations are as follows: Cultures of blood or cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs are not routinely recommended (strong, moderate). Cultures of blood are recommended (strong, moderate), and cutaneous and microscopic examination of cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs should be considered in patients with malignancy on chemotherapy, neutropenia, severe cell-mediated immunodeficiency, immersion injuries, and animal bites (weak, moderate). Typical cases of cellulitis without systemic signs of infection should receive an antimicrobial agent that is active against streptococci (mild; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). For cellulitis with systemic signs of infection (moderate nonpurulent SSTI; Figure 1) systemic antibiotics are indicated. Many clinicians could include coverage against MSSA (weak, low). For patients whose cellulitis is associated with penetrating trauma, evidence of MRSA infection elsewhere, nasal colonization with MRSA, injection drug use, or SIRS (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), vancomycin or another antimicrobial effective against both MRSA and streptococci is recommended (strong, moderate). In severely compromised patients (as defined in question 13), broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage may be considered (weak, moderate). Vancomycin plus either piperacillin-tazobactam or imipenem-meropenem is recommended as a reasonable empiric regimen for severe infection (strong, moderate). The recommended duration of antimicrobial therapy is 5 days, but treatment should be extended if the infection has not improved within this time period (strong, high). Elevation of the affected area and treatment of predisposing factors, such as edema or underlying cutaneous disorders, are recommended (strong, moderate). In lower extremity cellulitis, clinicians should carefully examine the interdigital toe spaces because treating fissuring, scaling, or maceration may eradicate colonization with pathogens and reduce the incidence of recurrent infection (strong, moderate). Outpatient therapy is recommended for patients who do not have SIRS, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability (mild nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). Hospitalization is recommended if there is concern for a deeper or necrotizing infection, for patients with poor adherence to therapy, for infection in a severely immunocompromised patient, or if outpatient treatment is failing (moderate or severe nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate).

### IDSA guidelines on the treatment of MRSA infections in… [^1131cRoq]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Empiric therapy for five to 10 days is recommended pending culture results for outpatients with purulent cellulitis. Infection from β-hemolytic streptococci does not usually require empiric therapy. For those with nonpurulent cellulitis, five to 10 days of empiric therapy for β-hemolytic streptococcal infection is recommended, based on the patient's clinical response. Empiric coverage for community-associated MRSA is recommended in patients who do not respond to beta-lactam antibiotics, and also may be considered in those with systemic toxicity. A beta-lactam antibiotic may be considered in hospitalized patients with nonpurulent cellulitis. MRSA-active therapy may be modified if there is no clinical response. Treatment for seven to 14 days is recommended, but should be individualized to the patient's clinical response.

Cultures from abscesses and other purulent infections are recommended in patients who have received antibiotic therapy, those with severe local infection or signs of systemic illness, and those who have not responded adequately to initial treatment. Cultures are also recommended if there is concern of a cluster or outbreak. Recommended treatment for adults with uncomplicated bacteremia includes vancomycin or daptomycin at a dosage of 6 mg per kg intravenously once per day for at least two weeks. For adults with complicated bacteremia, four to six weeks of therapy is recommended, depending on the extent of infection. Some experts recommend higher dosages of daptomycin. In patients with MRSA pneumonia complicated by empyema, antimicrobial therapy should be used with drainage procedures.

The optimal duration of therapy for MRSA osteomyelitis is unknown, although a minimum of eight weeks is recommended. Some experts suggest an additional one to three months of oral rifampin-based combination therapy with TMP/SMX, doxycycline, minocycline, clindamycin, or a fluoroquinolone, chosen based on susceptibilities. The duration of therapy should be individualized, but a minimum of three to four weeks is recommended for patients with septic arthritis, and four to six weeks for patients with osteomyelitis. Daptomycin and linezolid are alternative therapies.

SHEA/IDSA/APIC MRSA prevention — Decolonization therapy: Conduct a risk assessment to identify populations with high rates of MRSA infection that might benefit from decolonization; determine whether targeted or universal decolonization will be utilized, where targeted decolonization includes active surveillance testing (AST) to identify colonized individuals followed by decolonization and universal decolonization avoids testing and treats the entire at‑risk population with potential added benefit of reducing MSSA disease and addressing limitations of single‑site screening; select a decolonization regimen, noting that regimens typically include a combination of nasal and skin antisepsis; and consider standardized or protocol‑based order sets to optimize compliance.

### Duration of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus carriage, according to risk factors for acquisition [^114jr2DA]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the duration of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) carriage and its determinants and the influence of eradication regimens.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

A 1,033-bed tertiary care university hospital in Bern, Switzerland, in which the prevalence of methicillin resistance among S. aureus isolates is less than 5%.

Patients

A total of 116 patients with first-time MRSA detection identified at University Hospital Bern between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2003, were followed up for a mean duration of 16.2 months.

Results

Sixty-eight patients (58.6%) cleared colonization, with a median time to clearance of 7.4 months. Independent determinants for shorter carriage duration were the absence of any modifiable risk factor (receipt of antibiotics, use of an indwelling device, or presence of a skin lesion) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.20 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.09–0.42]), absence of immunosuppressive therapy (HR, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.23–1.02]), and hemodialysis (HR, 0.08 [95% CI, 0.01–0.66]) at the time MRSA was first MRSA detected and the administration of decolonization regimen in the absence of a modifiable risk factor (HR, 2.22 [95% CI, 1.36–3.64]). Failure of decolonization treatment was associated with the presence of risk factors at the time of treatment (P = 0.01). Intermittent screenings that were negative for MRSA were frequent (26% of patients), occurred early after first detection of MRSA (median, 31.5 days), and were associated with a lower probability of clearing colonization (HR, 0.34 [95% CI, 0.17–0.67]) and an increased risk of MRSA infection during follow-up.

Conclusions

Risk factors for MRSA acquisition should be carefully assessed in all MRSA carriers and should be included in infection control policies, such as the timing of decolonization treatment, the definition of MRSA clearance, and the decision of when to suspend isolation measures.

Suggested duration of therapy by site of infection

UTI, urinary tract infection.

Antibiotic durations should always be individualized to the patient and their clinical status. Many studies have underrepresentation of critically ill patients.

# 7 days is recommended in patients with community-acquired pneumonia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

* Consider prolonged courses of 14 days with non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli due to an increased risk of relapse/recurrence with shorter courses.

¶ After definitive source control.

† Trials excluded immunocompromised patients, patients with indwelling prostheses, infectious syndromes that required prolonged durations, or organisms that required prolonged durations of treatment (i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus lugdunensis). Most evidence for shorter courses is in bacteremia from gram negative bacteria secondary to urinary tract infections. Control of the primary source and blood culture clearance should also be achieved.

### Skin and soft tissue infections in the elderly [^114hZ4WE]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Elderly patients have peculiar characteristics and the management of infectious diseases may be challenging in this patients population. The term ABSSSIs does not reflect the complexity of skin infections in elderly patients. Some entities, such as pressure ulcers and decubitus, occur frequently in these patients and need special awareness. Most elderly patients are characterized by multiple comorbidities and high risk for polypharmacy interactions. An accurate identification of patients at risk for infections caused by difficult-to-treat microorganisms such as MRSA is necessary, as well as a correct management including the early empirical administration of an active antibiotic therapy. The choice of antibiotic therapy should take in account various factors, including safety of the delivered drugs, interactions, patient profile, and possibility of permitting an early discharge, thus minimizing the costs of hospitalization. The use of long-acting antibiotics should be evaluated in these patients to avoid hospitalization and its related complications. Future research should focus on atypical presentation of SSTIs in the elderly and on the identification of patients who need antibiotic therapy and avoid antibiotic misuse. The discrimination of contamination or colonization and the presence of bacterial superinfection in patients with special SSTI such as pressure ulcers, is crucial in these cases and specific diagnostic work-up should be developed. Moreover, outpatient management should be strengthened and stakeholders and institution should be involved to implement this outpatient care.

Quality of evidence definitions — Table 2 characterizes evidence as high, moderate, or low quality. High indicates confidence that the true effect is close to the estimated size and direction with little variation between studies and a narrow confidence interval. Moderate states the true effect is likely close to the estimate but may be substantially different when fewer studies or wider confidence intervals are present. Low indicates the true effect may be substantially different when supporting studies have major flaws, important variation exists, confidence intervals are very wide, or there are no rigorous studies.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^1113RHL3]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Diabetic foot infections — empiric initiation, culture guidance, and monitoring: Reliable specimens for cultures may be obtained through curettage of the infected ulcer, and oral antibiotic therapy is usually sufficient as initial therapy. Antimicrobial treatment should be started as soon as possible with an agent providing adequate gram positive coverage, recognizing that gram negative organisms might also be involved. Although the incidence of MRSA infections has increased, methicillin-sensitive S aureus (MSSA) remains the most likely pathogen in community-acquired diabetic foot infections; therefore, initial antibiotic coverage must be tailored to cover MSSA unless culture/sensitivity or pathogen history indicates specific coverage, and antibiotics should be adjusted according to culture results and the patient's response to treatment. While many useful oral agents such as cephalexin, clindamycin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and levofloxacin are available for mild to moderate infections, relatively few have been studied or have demonstrated superiority and IDSA guidelines contain no specific recommendations. All antibiotic treatments should be monitored for development of resistance, and most cases of cellulitis respond within 3 to 5 days of initiation of appropriate antibiotics; if cellulitis is slow to respond, worsens, or recurs following several days of treatment, the ulceration should be reassessed and possibly reevaluated. Bacteria frequently develop resistance, especially with prolonged therapy, which is not uncommon with the quinolones.

### How to stratify patients at risk for resistant bugs in skin and soft tissue infections? [^115wi2ak]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This article describes the strategies for stratifying patients with skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) according to their risk for infection with multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens.

Recent Findings

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) now represents the main cause in a variety of serious SSTIs. Risk factors for MRSA are constantly evolving and the distinction between community-acquired MRSA and hospital-acquired MRSA is becoming less clear from a therapeutic standpoint because of overlapping susceptibility patterns. Given these observations, physicians should be aware that directed empirical coverage of MRSA for serious SSTIs should be required in communities where this resistant pathogen is recognized to be a prevalent cause of infection. Similarly, other MDR bacteria are demonstrating alarming trends as causative pathogens in SSTIs. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus can play an important role in polymicrobial long-standing infections such as diabetic foot infection and decubiti, but are also increasingly recognized in monomicrobial SSTIs.

Summary

SSTIs caused by MDR bacteria, both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, are on the rise especially in patients with long-standing infections and those with prior antibiotic exposure. Recognition of risk factors for infection with MDR bacteria should assist clinicians in targeting appropriate antibiotic therapy to at-risk individuals.

The emergence of community-associated MRSA strains has greatly influenced the selection of empirical antibiotic therapy for ABSSSIs. To provide adequate empirical coverage for MRSA, an understanding of local microbial epidemiologic patterns and susceptibility patterns is essential. For the treatment of an abscess, the IDSA guidelines recommend, in addition to incision and drainage, administration of an antibiotic active against MRSA when the initial antibiotic treatment has failed or when the patient has immunosuppression, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), or hypotension. For cellulitis and erysipelas, including an antibiotic with activity against MRSA and group A streptococcus is recommended when the infection is associated with penetrating trauma or when there is evidence of MRSA infection, MRSA colonization, injecting drug use, or SIRS. Further, including an antimicrobial agent active against MRSA in the treatment of surgical wound infections is recommended in patients with risk factors for infection by this microorganism (nasal colonization or prior infection, hospitalization, or recent antibiotic administration). Anti-MRSA agents for ABSSSIs include vancomycin, which is considered the first-line parenteral treatment of serious MRSA infections in hospitalized patients, as well as linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline (Table 3). Other agents with reliable MRSA activity that have been approved for ABSSSIs include ceftaroline, tedizolid, dalbavancin, oritavancin, and telavancin. Additional factors for administering these medications include tolerability, formulation, cost, and dosing limitations associated with these agents, such as vancomycin-related nephrotoxicity and linezolid-associated myelosuppression.

### Staphylococcal skin and soft tissue infections [^114JW9ff]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is the most common bacteria causing purulent skin and soft tissue infections. Many disease-causing S aureus strains are methicillin resistant; thus, empiric therapy should be given to cover methicillin-resistant S aureus. Bacterial wound cultures are important for characterizing local susceptibility patterns. Definitive antibiotic therapy is warranted, although there are no compelling data demonstrating superiority of any one antibiotic over another. Antibiotic choice is predicated by the infection severity, local susceptibility patterns, and drug-related safety, tolerability, and cost. Response to therapy is expected within the first days; 5 to 7 days of therapy is typically adequate to achieve cure.

### Is it time to replace vancomycin in the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections? [^111m3NJf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

For more than 4 decades, vancomycin has been the antibiotic of choice for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. Recently, infections due to isolates with high but susceptible vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations have been associated with additional treatment failures and patient mortality. These poorer outcomes may in part be explained by the inability of attaining appropriate vancomycin levels in these patients. However, assumptions that these poor outcomes are solely due to failure to achieve optimal serum levels of vancomycin are premature. The availability of effective alternatives further erodes the position of vancomycin as first-line therapy. The emergence of resistance and cost considerations, however, favor a more measured approach when using alternative antimicrobials. Collectively, the current available data suggest that the optimal therapy for MRSA infections remains unclear. In the absence of further data, the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines remain relevant and inform clinicians of best practice for treating patients with MRSA infections.

TREATMENT GUIDELINES

Most recently, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) published practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of ABSSSIs. This publication predates the FDA approval of several newer antibiotics for the treatment of ABSSSIs, including dalbavancin, oritavancin, tedizolid, and delafloxacin. The guidelines divide ABSSSIs into purulent and nonpurulent categories. Cellulitis and erysipelas are considered nonpurulent, while abscesses are categorized as purulent. Vancomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, daptomycin, ceftaroline, and telavancin are all considered appropriate antimicrobial agents for treatment of severe purulent infections, while trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and doxycycline are recommended for moderate purulent infections. For methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), cefazolin and clindamycin are recommended for severe infections and dicloxacillin and cephalexin for moderate infections. Vancomycin plus piperacillin/tazobactam is recommended as a first-line treatment option for severe nonpurulent infections, particularly suspected necrotizing or polymicrobial infections. However, this combination has been associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury when compared with vancomycin with or without other beta-lactams. Options for treatment of mild to moderate nonpurulent infections include cefazolin, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, and penicillin. Although there is a lack of data to support the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy, the guidelines recommend a treatment duration of 7–10 days.

Recent antibiotic development for ABSSSIs has focused largely on the coverage of gram-positive organisms, especially MRSA (Table 2). However, acute skin infections that involve gram-negative pathogens are associated with a potential risk for inadequate antimicrobial therapy. Clinicians need to consider risk factors for infections due to gram-negative pathogens in selected patients. Moreover, although gram-negative pathogens are commonly found in polymicrobial infections, they have also been observed in monomicrobial skin infections. Cultures with only gram-negative pathogens have been reported in approximately 13% of patients hospitalized with serious skin infections (not limited to ABSSSI), while mixed cultures have been found in 11%–21%. Selection of empiric antibiotic therapy for suspected gram-negative skin infections should be guided by local epidemiologic patterns, as well as infection type and individual patient characteristics.

### How I manage a patient with MRSA bacteraemia [^116McRrj]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections are common and associated with a high mortality of 15–25%. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bloodstream infection accounts for 10–40% of cases, and has an even higher mortality. Despite being the 'bread and butter' of clinical infectious diseases practice, robust evidence to guide optimal management is often lacking and there is wide variation in practice.

Objectives

To provide a real-world example of a case of MRSA bacteraemia and the thought processes of the authors as key management decision points are reached.

Sources

The discussion is based on recent literature searches of relevant topics. In making recommendations, randomized clinical trial data have been prioritized and highlighted, and where these are not available recommendations are based on the experience and opinions of the authors.

Content

For a patient with MRSA bacteraemia and a primary bone and joint infection the following points are discussed: empirical antibiotic choice for suspected S. aureus bacteraemia; directed antibiotic choice for MRSA; monitoring and dosing of vancomycin; the role of combination therapy when bacteraemia is persistent; and the duration of therapy and role of switching to oral antibiotics.

Implications

While broad principles of aggressive source control and appropriate choice and duration of antibiotics are important, the heterogeneity of S. aureus bacteraemia means that a tailored rather than algorithmic approach to management is often required. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to strengthen the evidence base for the management of MRSA bacteraemia.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^113DCRdM]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Pressure ulcers are localized areas of tissue necrosis that tend to develop when soft-tissue is compressed between a bony prominence and an external surface for a prolonged period of time. The damage may be relatively minor, or it may lead to massive destruction of deeper tissues. The majority of pressure ulcers develop in areas adjacent to the ischium, sacrum, and greater trochanter. Pressure ulcers represent a frequent problem especially in frail elderly patients with chronic co-morbidities. When infection occurs, it is typically polymicrobial and includes aerobes (S. aureus, Enterococcus spp. Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas spp.) and anaerobes (Peptococcus spp. Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens).

Combination of surgical and antibiotic interventions may be required to manage infected decubitus ulcers. Surgical debridement is necessary to remove necrotic tissue. Antibiotic therapy should be used for patients with severe pressure ulcer infections, including those with spreading cellulitis or patients with systemic signs of infection. Because such infections usually are polymicrobial, therapeutic regimens should be directed against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative facultative organisms as well as anaerobic organisms. In many cases of pressure ulcers, correct wound care management can largely prevent the occurrence of these infections.

Risk factors for MRSA among colonized patients — A substantial proportion of colonized patients subsequently develop MRSA infection, including pneumonia, soft-tissue infection, or primary bloodstream infection, with adult estimates ranging from 9% to 33%. Risk persists after discharge; among persons previously identified with MRSA colonization, the risk of developing MRSA infection within 18 months was 29%. In a more recent cohort of in-hospital identified MRSA carriers, 9% developed MRSA infection within 1 year.

### Editorial commentary: duration of colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: a question with many answers [^117LHr5C]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Emergency room visits and hospital admissions for skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) have been increasing, with a high prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) cultured from the site of infection. By recent estimates, approximately 7% of patients in US hospitals are colonized with MRSA. This includes an increase in colonization with community-acquired strains commonly associated with SSTIs.

According to the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, the duration of colonization remains an unresolved issue. Data have shown that individuals remain at increased risk of MRSA infection and death until they are no longer colonized. However, there is a wide range of estimates for the median time to clearance, ranging from 7 to 9 months to well beyond a year. Thus, many US hospitals recommend waiting 6 months or more prior to screening for clearance of MRSA colonization.

In this issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases, the study by Cluzet et al adds to the debate on the duration of MRSA colonization, looking at clearance following diagnosis of an SSTI with a positive MRSA culture. In this longitudinal sampling study, MRSA surveillance cultures were collected from nares, axilla, and groin every 2 weeks for up to 6 months on both index cases and their household members. The first finding of interest was a median duration of MRSA colonization of only 21 days, far less than what has been noted in prior studies. I will point out, however, that 92% of the index cases received a systemic anti-MRSA antibiotic as treatment for their SSTI, and around 20% were prescribed topical nasal mupirocin and/or chlorhexidine/bleach baths in the 2 weeks following SSTI diagnosis. The second finding of interest was that SSTI treatment with clindamycin was associated with earlier clearance of MRSA colonization. To my knowledge, this is the first time that this has been suggested in the literature.

### Maximizing positive outcomes for patients with staphylococcal infections [^114v9cps]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2009). Low credibility.

Maximizing positive outcomes for serious Gram-positive infections, such as those caused by Staphylococcus species, requires an aggressive treatment approach. Although specific approaches will depend upon many factors, the underlying common strategy should recognize the positive contribution of minimizing complications and inpatient treatment duration and the efficient use of healthcare resources, while also focusing on rapid resolution of infection and safety and tolerability. To advance the standard of care for patients, we need to utilize therapies that enable such a range of factors to be improved. Treatment guidelines are useful to establish evidence-based standards of care, but they are updated infrequently and there is currently no pan-European consensus for the treatment of staphylococcal infections. With the benefit of the clinical experience that has been acquired for the most recently licensed antibiotics, together with an appreciation of the appropriate usage of older agents, there are good prospects for achieving positive outcomes earlier and in a greater range of patients with staphylococcal infections, and treatment guidelines should be updated regularly to reflect this.

### SHEA / IDSA / APIC practice recommendation: strategies to prevent methicillin-resistanttransmission and infection in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^1177CFRE]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). High credibility.

SHEA/IDSA/APIC — MRSA outbreak control — Decolonization should be strongly considered as part of a multimodal approach to control MRSA outbreaks (Quality of evidence: MODERATE). Although no clinical trials have tested strategies to control MRSA outbreaks, many quasi-experimental studies have demonstrated successful outbreak control that includes MRSA decolonization as part of a multimodal approach to reduce MRSA transmission and infection. In outbreak situations, decolonization can protect colonized individuals from infection and reduce colonization pressure that may promote transmission, and intranasal therapy reduces infection risk for individual patients.

Selection of patients

Patients were assessed in the ED and enrolled based on the same inclusion and exclusion criteria in both the usual care (February 2017 to January 2018) and the clinical pathway periods (March 2018 to March 2019). Enrollment criteria were created based on investigator consensus to identify patients with a moderately severe SSTI for whom parenteral therapy could be indicated due to infection severity, yet who, based on the judgment of the treating providers, could otherwise receive treatment in an outpatient setting.SSTIs were defined as skin lesions with erythema, swelling, tenderness, and/or drainage based on physical examination and categorized as follows: abscess was defined as a closed skin lesion found to have purulent exudate upon incision and drainage, cellulitis was defined as a closed skin lesion without evidence of a wound, and wound infection was defined as an open skin lesion. We estimated lesion area by measurement of the maximal length and perpendicular width of the infection, which was outlined by a tissue marker, using the formula for an ellipse (1/4 × π × length ×width).

We enrolled patients who were ≥ 18 years of age with abscess, cellulitis, or wound infection of known or suspected Gram‐positive etiology with an area of infection of ≥ 75 cm 2. Exclusion criteria included patients with an unstable comorbidity (e.g. diabetic ketoacidosis, severe sepsis), immunosuppression, injection drug use and fever, pregnancy or breastfeeding, bilateral lower extremity involvement, severe neurological disorder, history of allergy to glycopeptide antibiotics, suspected Gram‐negative infection, infection likely to require broad‐spectrum antibiotics or more intensive care (e.g. infections associated with abdominal surgery, perirectal or perineal location, diabetic foot or decubitus ulcer, or animal or human bite or requiring drainage or debridement in the operating room or intensive care), known or suspected osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, or endocarditis (Appendix 1). These enrollment criteria are consistent with the U.S. FDA's definition of an ABSSSI, for which dalbavancin treatment has been FDA‐approved. We also required eligible patients to be willing to return for evaluation and provide informed consent. A complete description of the enrollment criteria can be found in Appendix 1.

### The use of systemic antibiotics in the treatment of chronic wounds [^116iXm1J]. Dermatologic Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

The role of microorganisms in the etiology and persistence of chronic wounds remains poorly understood. The chronic wound bed houses a complex microenvironment that typically includes more than one bacterial species. Difficulty lies in determining when the presence of bacteria impedes wound healing, thereby warranting intervention. Indications for antibiotic therapy and optimal treatment regimens are ill defined. The goal of this article is to describe the appropriate role of systemic antibiotics in the management of chronic wounds. A common sense approach will be offered based on six clinically pertinent questions: Is infection present? Are systemic antibiotics necessary? Should treatment be enteral or parenteral? What antibiotic or combination of antibiotics should be used? What should be the duration of therapy? What special circumstances are present (i.e., concomitant illnesses, potential drug-drug interactions) that can impact therapy?

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^117XWsQz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Glycopeptides have been for many years the microbiological agents of choice used in complicated Gram-positive infections. Fortunately, staphylococcal resistance to glycopeptides remains rare, although rising minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of glycopeptides may affect the efficacy of these antibiotics.

Increased resistance to glycopeptides has encouraged the development of new agents active against Gram-positive bacteria, particularly for severe soft-tissue infections where aggressive antimicrobial management is always recommended, such as linezolid and daptomycin. Linezolid has been considered an agent of choice in complicated skin and soft-tissue infections (cSSTIs). It has the advantages of early intravenous-to-oral switch with the oral preparation having very high bioavailability and excellent tissue penetration.

In 2010, an open-label study compared oral or intravenous linezolid with intravenous vancomycin for treatment of cSSTIs caused by MRSA. Patients receiving linezolid had a significantly shorter length of stay and duration of intravenous therapy than those receiving vancomycin. Both agents were well tolerated. Adverse events were similar to each drug's established safety profile.

Recently, a Cochrane meta-analysis included all randomized controlled trials comparing linezolid with vancomycin in the treatment of SSTIs. Linezolid was associated with a significantly better clinical (risk ratio [RR] = 1.09, 95% CI, 1.03–1.16) and microbiological cure rate in adults (RR = 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01–1.16). For infections caused by MRSA, linezolid was significantly more effective than vancomycin in clinical (RR = 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03–1.17) and microbiological cure rates (RR = 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04–1.32).

The daily cost of outpatient therapy was less with oral linezolid than with intravenous vancomycin. Although inpatient treatment with linezolid cost more than inpatient treatment with vancomycin per day, the median length of hospital stay was 3 days shorter with linezolid.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^111aNudS]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What oral antibiotics can be used for the management of MRSA skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs)? What intravenous antibiotics can be used for the management of MRSA skin and soft-tissue infections?

For oral antibiotic coverage of MRSA in patients with SSTI, we suggest the following agents: linezolid (recommendation 1A), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) (recommendation 1B), a tetracycline (doxycycline or minocycline) (recommendation 1B), or tedizolid (Recommendation 1A).

For intravenous (IV) antibiotic coverage of MRSA in patients with SSTI, we suggest the following agents: daptomycin (10 mg/kg/dose IV once daily) (recommendation 1A), IV linezolid (recommendation 1A), IV ceftaroline (recommendation 1A), IV dalbavancin (recommendation 1A), IV vancomycin (recommendation 1A), IV tigecycline (recommendation 1A), or IV tedizolid (recommendation 1A).

Seven to 14 days of therapy is recommended but should be individualized on the basis of the patient's clinical response (recommendation 1A). IV to oral switch should occur when criteria of clinical stability have been reached (recommendation 1C).

For CA-MRSA, recommended oral agents are clindamycin, although clindamycin resistance is now very common, tetracyclines, TMP-SMX, linezolid, tedizolid, and occasionally, fluoroquinolones. Several observational studies and one small randomized trial suggest that TMP-SMX, doxycycline, and minocycline are effective for such infections. If coverage for both streptococci and MRSA is desired for oral therapy, options include clindamycin alone, or the combination of either TMP-SMX or doxycycline with a beta-lactam (e.g. penicillin, cephalexin, or amoxicillin).

### Focus on the prophylaxis, epidemiology and therapy of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus surgical site infections and a position paper on associated risk factors: the perspective of an Italian group of surgeons [^113dseJp]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

S. aureus is consistently the leading cause of nosocomial infections, including SSIs, and the incidence of MRSA strains is rising dramatically. Admissions to hospital because of MRSA infections have more than doubled in the past decade, and MRSA is the leading cause of SSIs in many academic and community hospitals.

MRSA as a cause of a SSI was also shown to be a significant independent risk factor for adverse economic outcomes. The risk-adjusted attributable increase in duration of hospitalization was approximately 1 day and the increase in hospitalization costs was over $1,000. Other studies support the finding that patients with MRSA infections require more health care resources than patients with methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) infections. Kirkland et al. estimated that the excess hospital costs associated with MRSA SSIs ranged from $3,089 to $35,367. Engemann et al. found that, among surgical patients, those with MRSA infections were hospitalized 5 days longer than those with MSSA. Hospital charges for patients with MRSA infections were also $62,908 greater than those for patients without an infection and $40,000 greater than for patients with MSSA infections.

Weigelt et al. found that significant independent risk factors increasing cost and duration of hospitalization SSIs due to MRSA included illness severity, transfer from another health care facility, previous admissions (within the preceding 30 days), and other polymicrobial infections (p < 0.05).

Because universal, rapid MRSA screening is not recommended by all authors, identifying patients at risk of colonization by MRSA and subsequently of SSIs could be very useful.

Harbarth et al. found that emergency surgery, presence of comorbid condition, immunosuppressive therapy, contaminated surgery, and a surgical duration longer than the 75th percentile were the strongest risk factors for MRSA colonization in surgical patients and these factors were confirmed in a validation cohort. We also tried to identify risk factors for colonization and/or infection by MRSA. We analyzed the literature in order to list and quantify the risks of colonization and/or infection by MRSA in surgical patients. The risk factors and protective factors that emerged from Italian literature are presented in Table 9.

International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) 2023 mechanical circulatory support — antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) recommendations specify Class I measures including S. aureus decolonization in nasal carriers using intranasal mupirocin 2% ointment with or without chlorhexidine gluconate body wash; an AP regime that covers Staphylococcus species in all patients; AP infusion within one hour prior to the first incision; additional intra-operative dose(s) if the operative procedure last longer than 2 half-lives of the AP agent(s); preoperative bathing or showering with plain or antimicrobial soap; a preoperative nasal swab to screen for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; vancomycin use per surgical guidelines where there is a high likelihood or documented MRSA colonization; vancomycin infusion 2 hours prior to first incision to achieve therapeutic range; and additional intraoperative dose(s) with significant blood losses of more than 1500 mL. Class II guidance states vancomycin might be considered in high risk patients (BMI < 18, > 30, Reoperation, renal failure, diabetes mellitus, COPD or immunosuppressed patients), the local epidemiological experience of infectious disease specialists should guide AP, secondary prophylaxis should be considered in all mechanical circulatory support (MCS) patients (e.g. dental procedures), and an infectious diseases consultation should be considered before extending AP beyond 48 hours. Class III recommendations are that application of broad-spectrum gram-negative prophylaxis is not recommended to avoid possible drug-drug interactions, routine anti-fungal prophylaxis is not recommended, the duration of AP should not exceed 48 hours, and the duration of antibiotic prophylaxis should not be extended due to the presence of open-chest situation or remaining chest drainages.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in children with HIV — HIV infection appears to be a risk factor for MRSA infections in children and adults, but findings are conflicting about the relative contribution of immunosuppression versus the impact of social determinants of health; limited data suggest that children with HIV, like their uninfected counterparts, experience predominantly non-invasive, skin, and soft tissue infections as a result of community-associated MRSA strains and that greater immunosuppression may not confer greater risk of MRSA, and Staphylococcus aureus (both methicillin-susceptible and MRSA) should be considered in people with a recent viral infection (especially influenza) or complicated pneumonia.

Risk factors for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection

The presence of at least one of the following criteria is at risk for MRSA: residency in post-acute care facility, chronic hemodialysis, long-term transcutaneous intravascular devices, MRSA colonization or infection in the last twelve months, exposure to ß-lactams or fluoroquinolones in the previous 3 months, immunosuppression (such as ongoing malignancy, transplantation, chemotherapy, corticosteroids (prednisone ≥ 25 mg/day), splenectomy, immunosuppressive therapies, autoimmune diseases), complex home care and chronic wound.

In the US, risk factors for community-acquired MRSA are as follows: neonates, children beyond the neonatal period, athletes, household contacts of MRSA skin and soft tissue infection patients, emergency department patients, urban undeserved communities, indigenous populations, detainees in jail or prison, cystic fibrosis patients, military personnel, men who have sex with men, HIV patients, veterinarians, livestock handlers, and pet owners. Travelers from America, North Africa, Western Asia, Southern Europe, Asia and Oceania are also at risk for MRSA colonization for twelve months following return. In settings with high endemicity of CA-MRSA, empirical antibiotic coverage targeting MRSA is warranted, in line with previous guidelines. Healthcare-associated infections are considered as risk factors in settings where the prevalence of MRSA is high.

In pediatric population, approximately 30% of Panton-Valentin leucocidin (PVL)-producing strains are MRSA and the higher prevalence of community-acquired MRSA in children supports the inclusion of anti-MRSA coverage in empirical antibiotic therapy for this specific population.

Severe allergy to β-lactams

Defined by anaphylaxis and/or severe delayed hypersensitivity cutaneous reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction (or rash) with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, bullous exanthemas, or maculopapular exanthema.

Sepsis

Defined by a Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score > 2 in adults. In children, it is assessed using the Phoenix sepsis score ≥ 2.

Septic shock

Defined, in adults, by a serum lactate level ≥ 2 mmol/L and the need for vasopressor therapy to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mmHg. In children, it is defined by a Phoenix hemodynamic score ≥ 1 point (need for vasoactive treatment, lactate level ≥ 5 mmol/L, or age-specific hypotension).

Evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections were prepared by an Expert Panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). The guidelines are intended for use by health care providers who care for adult and pediatric patients with MRSA infections. The guidelines discuss the management of a variety of clinical syndromes associated with MRSA disease, including skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI), bacteremia and endocarditis, pneumonia, bone and joint infections, and central nervous system (CNS) infections. Recommendations are provided regarding vancomycin dosing and monitoring, management of infections due to MRSA strains with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin, and vancomycin treatment failures.

### Hospitalizations with healthcare-associated complicated skin and skin structure infections: impact of inappropriate empiric therapy on outcomes [^115AiTg4]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Inappropriate empiric therapy worsens outcomes in certain healthcare-associated infections (HCAI). We studied the association of inappropriate empiric therapy with outcomes in patients with HCA complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI).

Design

A single-center retrospective cohort study.

Patients

Hospitalized with a culture-positive cSSSI.

Measurements

We defined HCA-cSSSI as having ≥ 1 of these risk factors: (1) recent hospitalization, (2) recent antibiotics, (3) hemodialysis, (4) transfer from a nursing home, and inappropriate treatment as no antimicrobial therapy active against the pathogen(s) within 24 hours of obtaining culture specimen. We performed descriptive and multivariate statistics to compute the impact of inappropriate empiric therapy on outcomes. Hospital length of stay (LOS) served as primary and mortality as secondary outcomes.

Results

Of the 717 patients with culture-positive cSSSI, 527 (73.5%) had HCAI, of whom 405 (76.9%) received appropriate treatment. A higher proportion of those receiving inappropriate than appropriate treatment had a decubitus ulcer (29.5% vs. 10.9%, P < 0.001), a device-associated infection (42.6% vs. 28.6%, P = 0.004), or bacteremia (68.9% vs. 57.8%, P = 0.028). The frequency of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) did not differ between the groups. The low overall unadjusted mortality rate did not vary based on initial treatment. In a multivariable analysis adjusting for potential confounders inappropriate therapy had an attributable increase in hospital LOS of 1.8 days (95% CI, 1.4–2.3).

Conclusion

Similar to other populations with HCAI, HCA-cSSSI patients are likely to receive inappropriate empiric therapy for their infection. This early exposure is associated with a significant prolongation of the hospitalization by nearly 2 days.

### Fluoroquinolones and risk for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Canada [^1132u1Lx]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

MRSA Infection

For analysis of MRSA infections, we could use all 7,371 EOCs, but power was limited by the small number of outcomes (n = 23). MRSA colonization at time of admission was by far the strongest independent risk factor for MRSA infection (Table 2). The other independent risk factors were having undergone surgery, having received fluoroquinolones or systemic corticosteroids, and having a history of peptic ulcer disease. Sex and immunosuppression were not associated with MRSA infection (data not shown). For the fluoroquinolones (whose median duration of use was 5 days), AHR was higher for the 958 patients who received this class of antimicrobial drugs for > 5 days (AHR 3.70, 95% CI 1.49–9.18) because MRSA infection did not develop in any of the 699 patients who received fluoroquinolones for 1 to 4 days. The association was stronger for those who received both ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin (n = 124, AHR 4.61, 95% CI 1.16–18.41), intermediate for those who received only ciprofloxacin (n = 1124, AHR 2.25, 95% CI 0.84–6.01), and absent for those who received only levofloxacin (n = 363, AHR 1.10, 95% CI 0.13–9.35). None of the other classes of antimicrobial drugs was associated with MRSA infection after adjustment for confounders. According to multivariate analysis, the following were no longer associated with MRSA infection: age, duration of hospital stay, a high Charlson score, peripheral vascular disease or ischemic heart disease, ICU stay, and tube feeding. No interaction was found. The small number of outcomes precluded the identification of factors protective against MRSA infection.

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) — classification, microbiology, and specimen approach are outlined: SSTIs "are often classified as simple (uncomplicated) or complicated (necrotizing or non-necrotizing) and may involve skin, subcutaneous fat, fascial layers, and musculoskeletal structures". Primary cutaneous infections "are commonly caused by a narrow spectrum of pyogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A streptococcus))". In diabetic foot infections, "Anaerobic bacteria are important and predominate pathogens in DFIs and should always be considered when choosing therapeutic options", and "The majority of DFIs are polymicrobial, but gram-positive cocci, specifically staphylococci, are the predominate infectious agents; Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major pathogen in the majority of chronic DFIs". For wound culture strategy, "Surface cultures of such wounds, including decubitus ulcers are of little value as they represent colonizing microbes, which cannot be easily differentiated from the underlying etiologic agent", whereas "Tissue biopsies, preferably a full-thickness biopsy, following thorough debridement, or bone biopsies obtained through a debrided site, are optimal for obtaining clinically relevant information". Necrotizing cutaneous infections "are usually caused by streptococci and less often by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) or Klebsiella species but are often polymicrobial".

### Antibiotic therapy for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in surgical wounds [^116HKYxm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection after surgery is usually rare, but incidence can be up to 33% in certain types of surgery. Postoperative MRSA infection can occur as surgical site infections (SSI), chest infections, or bloodstream infections (bacteraemia). The incidence of MRSA SSIs varies from 1% to 33% depending upon the type of surgery performed and the carrier status of the individuals concerned. The optimal antibiotic regimen for the treatment of MRSA in surgical wounds is not known.

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of various antibiotic treatments in people with established surgical site infections (SSIs) caused by MRSA.

Search Methods

In February 2013 we searched the following databases: The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE); NHS Economic Evaluation Database; Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Database; Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; and EBSCO CINAHL.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing one antibiotic regimen with another antibiotic regimen for the treatment of SSIs due to MRSA. All RCTs irrespective of language, publication status, publication year, or sample size were included in the analysis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently decided on inclusion and exclusion of trials, and extracted data. We planned to calculate the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for comparing the binary outcomes between the groups and mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for comparing the continuous outcomes. We planned to perform the meta-analysis using both a fixed-effect and a random-effects model. We performed intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible.

Main Results

We included one trial involving 59 people hospitalised because of MRSA SSIs. Thirty participants were randomised to linezolid (600 mg either intravenously or orally every 12 hours for seven to 14 days) and 29 to vancomycin (1 g intravenously every 12 hours for seven to 14 days). The type of surgical procedures that were performed were not reported. The trial reported one outcome, which was the eradication of MRSA. The proportion of people in whom MRSA was eradicated was statistically significantly higher in the linezolid group than in the vancomycin group (RR 1.80; 95% CI 1.20 to 2.68).

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently no evidence to recommend any specific antibiotic in the treatment of MRSA SSIs. Linezolid is superior to vancomycin in the eradication of MRSA SSIs on the basis of evidence from one small trial that was at high risk of bias, but the overall clinical implications of using linezolid instead of vancomycin are not known. Further well-designed randomised clinical trials are necessary in this area.

### SHEA / IDSA / APIC practice recommendation: strategies to prevent methicillin-resistanttransmission and infection in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^111xQHjZ]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Several randomized clinical trials (discussed below) have shown that decolonization significantly reduces MRSA carriage, transmission, and subsequent infection in patients known to carry MRSA or to be at risk of MRSA acquisition and/or infection. These are discussed below within the specific recommendations.

S. aureus outcomes identified through the literature review for MRSA outcomes have been described due to the relevant interest for healthcare-associated infection (HAI) reduction from S. aureus regardless of susceptibility pattern, but the recommendations are based on available evidence to reduce MRSA.

Few studies of high-quality evidence have evaluated MRSA outcomes in children. Most data supporting the recommendations below have been generated in adult patient populations. When available, pediatric data are noted.

Complications of decolonization therapy are rare and generally mild; however, hospitals should be aware of potential adverse effects, such as drug-related toxicities and development of resistance (eg, mupirocin) or reduced susceptibility (eg, chlorhexidine) to the agents used, when considering the potential benefits and risks of implementing a MRSA or S. aureus decolonization program. –
Use universal decolonization (daily CHG bathing plus 5 days of nasal decolonization) for all patients in adult ICUs to reduce endemic MRSA clinical cultures. (Quality of evidence: HIGH) The previously described REDUCE MRSA Trial demonstrated that universal decolonization of ICU patients with daily CHG bathing and 5 days of twice-daily mupirocin was superior to screening and targeted decolonization as well as to screening and targeted contact precautions for prevention of MRSA-positive clinical isolates and all-cause bloodstream infection.(See Section 4 Additional Approaches for Preventing MRSA, Active Surveillance Testing recommendation.) For determining the applicability of this regimen to hospitals, trial benefit occurred at fairly low endemic levels of > 3 MRSA clinical cultures per 1,000 ICU days. This approach has been demonstrated to be cost-effective, including sparing the cost of screening. Climo et alreported that universal CHG alone in adult ICUs reduced bloodstream infections by 28% and reduced the composite of MRSA and vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (VRE) acquisition by 23%. Derde et al (2013)also demonstrated that CHG bathing decreased MRSA acquisition in ICU standardization phases leading up to an RCT that showed no benefit of either conventional or rapid PCR MRSA screening and isolation over high compliance hand hygiene and universal CHG bathing. Even though universal CHG alone does not decolonize carriers, it is effective in reducing transmission of MRSA from carriers to noncarriers in ICUs. Thus, for the purpose of optimally addressing MRSA, the combined effects of mupirocin plus universal CHG are recommended. Finally, although universal decolonization has been found to be superior to screening and targeted decolonization, hospitals may have other reasons for screening patients for MRSA. These may include outbreak response, desire for surveillance data, desire to implement contact precautions for known carriers, and clinical reasons related to restricting empiric anti-MRSA therapy or preoperative vancomycin prophylaxis to known MRSA carriers.
Perform preoperative nares screening with targeted use of CHG and nasal decolonization in MRSA carriers to reduce MRSA SSI in surgical procedures involving implantation of hardware. (Quality of evidence: MODERATE) Note that decolonization can be applied universally as an alternative. Preoperative targeted screening and decolonization of S. aureus carriers is commonly performed for surgical procedures involving the placement of hardware to reduce SSI. Although most studies have evaluated S. aureus outcomes and are not specific to MRSA, a large meta-analysis of RCTs and other studies involving surgeries with hardware similarly found that targeted or universal nasal decolonization reduced S. aureus SSI and that nasal decolonization of MRSA carriers reduced MRSA SSI. S. aureus outcomes were not the target of this guidance document or its search strategy. Nevertheless, we highlight some the S. aureus evidence here because MRSA is a subset of S. aureus. In a large, 20-hospital, interventional cohort study of cardiac, hip, and knee surgeries, targeted nasal decolonization reduced S. aureus SSI. Additionally, in a post-hoc analysis of a single-center RCT of 1,697 patients undergoing arthroplasty or spinal fusion, universal nasal 5% povidone-iodine was superior to universal 2% mupirocin for S. aureus deep SSI. Universal nasal decolonization without nasal screening can be employed for pragmatic reasons to spare the logistics for screening for S. aureus or MRSA. Use of povidone-iodine may also be chosen for pragmatic reasons because it does not require a prescription, including prescription-related transportation needs or insurance copays that may affect patient adherence. Please refer to the "Compendium of Strategies to Prevent Surgical Site Infections in Acute Care Hospitals: 2022 Update"for recommendations regarding decolonization for organisms other than MRSA.
Screen for MRSA and provide targeted decolonization with CHG bathing and nasal decolonization to MRSA carriers in surgical units to reduce postoperative MRSA inpatient infections. (Quality of evidence: MODERATE) Note that decolonization can be applied universally as an alternative. In a multinational trial of 33 surgical units in 10 hospitals involving 126,750 admissions, an intervention of enhanced hand hygiene plus universal screening and targeted decolonization of MRSA carriers reduced MRSA clinical cultures by 12% per month. In a secondary analysis of clean surgical patients, universal screening and targeted decolonization of MRSA carriers reduced MRSA clinical cultures by 15% per month and MRSA infections by 17% per month. S. aureus outcomes were not the target of this guidance document nor its search strategy. Nevertheless, we highlight the key S. aureus evidence here because MRSA is a subset of S. aureus. In an RCT of 1,000 mostly surgical patients that evaluated universal inpatient screening for S. aureus and CHG and mupirocin for identified carriers, a significant 58% reduction was achieved in inpatient S. aureus infection among carriers. In addition, decolonization can reduce postsurgical inpatient infections beyond SSI. The Mupirocin and the Risk of Staphylococcus aureus (MARS) Studywas a 3,864-person RCT of the addition of mupirocin to preoperative chlorhexidine (CHG) for S. aureus carriers undergoing a variety of surgical procedures (ie, general, gynecologic, neurologic, oncologic, and cardiothoracic surgery) with and without hardware. This mupirocin addition significantly decreased nosocomial S. aureus infections by 51% among S. aureus carriers, although it did not significantly reduce S. aureus SSIs.
Provide CHG bathing plus nasal decolonization to known MRSA carriers outside the ICU with medical devices, specifically central lines, midline catheters, and lumbar drains, to reduce MRSA-positive clinical cultures. (Quality of evidence: MODERATE) The Active Bathing to Eliminate Infection (ABATE Infection) Trialwas a 53-hospital cluster-randomized trial involving nearly 340,000 patients comparing routine care to universal decolonization with CHG bathing plus targeted nasal mupirocin for known MRSA carriers. Active screening was not a component of this trial. No overall reduction in the composite outcome of MRSA or VRE carriage, nor all-cause bloodstream infections was detected. However, in a post-hoc analysis, non-ICU patients with medical devices had a significant 37% reduction in MRSA and VRE and a significant 32% reduction in all-cause bloodstream infections. Patients with medical devices (specifically, central lines, midlines, and lumbar drains) were only 10% of inpatients, but they had 37% of MRSA and VRE cultures and 56% of all-cause bloodstream infections.
Consider postdischarge decolonization of MRSA carriers to reduce postdischarge MRSA infections and readmission. (Quality of evidence: HIGH). The Changing Lives by Eradicating Antibiotic Resistance (CLEAR) Trialwas an RCT to decrease postdischarge infections in MRSA carriers comparing routine care to postdischarge decolonization (CHG bathing, CHG mouthwash, nasal mupirocin) given for 5 days twice monthly for 6 months. The trial involved 2,121 MRSA carriers. Decolonization significantly reduced MRSA infection (most requiring rehospitalization) by 30% in the 1-year follow-up period, with a number needed to treat of 30. The impact of a shorter duration of decolonization is not known, but the risk of postdischarge infection was higher with closer proximity to discharge. Postdischarge decolonization was first systematically performed by the Dutch Search and Destroy program to decolonize MRSA carriers to prevent infection. These postdischarge efforts require coordination and investment uncommonly adopted by hospitals. Because population-based medicine continues to be a goal for HAI prevention across the continuum of care, assessments of pragmatic implementation and adherence need to be addressed.
Neonatal ICUs should consider targeted or universal decolonization during times of above-average MRSA infection rates or targeted decolonization for patients at high risk of MRSA infection (eg, low birth weight, indwelling devices, or prior to high-risk surgeries). (Quality of evidence: MODERATE) S. aureus is a leading cause of HAI in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Neonates in the NICU, especially low-birthweight neonates, are at high risk of invasive S. aureus disease. Because most neonates have never left the hospital, neonates usually develop MRSA colonization or infection as a result of hospital-based transmission. Neonates acquire MRSA from colonized parents, HCP, or the environment. MRSA is the most commonly reported cause of NICU outbreaks, so when neonates in the NICU are identified with a hospital-onset MRSA infection, further assessment is warranted to identify an ongoing cluster of transmission. MRSA colonization is an important risk factor for subsequent infection in this population. Quasi-experimental studies have shown that decolonization can reduce MRSA infections during endemic and outbreak settings. Targeted and universal decolonization approaches have both been successfully used to reduce MRSA in this population. – Decolonization reduces MRSA colonization, acquisition and infection in neonates. Decolonization also reduces MSSA colonization and infections in this population. – Mupirocin and chlorhexidine are the most commonly used decolonization agents in NICUs. In a recent RCT, 66 infants were assigned to intranasal mupirocin, and no product-related moderate, serious, or severe adverse events occurred. Chlorhexidine has been safely used in neonates, but due to potential for skin irritation and systemic absorption, it should be used with caution in premature infants. The US Food and Drug Administration notes that chlorhexidine should be "used with care in premature infants or infants under 2 months of age". Chlorhexidine is used widely in NICUs and its use increased from 59% in 2009 to 86% in 2015 in a survey of US NICUs. Chlorhexidine-associated adverse events are infrequent, but many NICUs limit chlorhexidine use, especially in preterm infants within the first month of life. In addition to HCP and the environment, parents can be an important reservoir for S. aureus and can expose their neonates in the NICU. The TREAT PARENTS trial showed that decolonizing parents with intranasal mupirocin and topical chlorhexidine gluconate baths reduced transmission of MRSA and MSSA to neonates in the NICU.
Burn units should consider targeted or universal decolonization during times of above-average MRSA infection rates. (Quality of evidence: Moderate) Higher quality evidence is needed to support a recommendation for routine decolonization of burn patients (unresolved issue). Burn patients are at high risk of MRSA acquisition and infection. Quasi-experimental studies have shown that decolonization can reduce MRSA infections. Decolonization strategies have included universal intranasal mupirocin with chlorhexidine antisepsis, universal decolonization using mupirocin and daily hypochlorous acid solution, and octenidine antisepsis for intact skin and nasal mucosa. – Given inconsistent results on the safety of antiseptics to interfere with wound healing, the role of topical antisepsis in this population for MRSA prevention must carefully balance the risk of toxicity and benefit of preventing MRSA infections. Therefore, the decision to implement targeted or universal decolonization in burn patients should be guided by a local risk assessment of MRSA incidence.
Consider targeted or universal decolonization of hemodialysis patients. (Quality of evidence: MODERATE) Higher-quality evidence is needed to support a recommendation for routine decolonization of dialysis patients. MRSA bloodstream infections complicate care of hemodialysis patients. MRSA colonization predisposes individuals to subsequent MRSA infections, and hemodialysis patients have one of the highest risks of MRSA invasive disease, with a risk of 45 per 1,000 patients, which as 100-fold higher than that of the average population. A systematic review and meta-analysis found that intranasal mupirocin with chlorhexidine body washes can eradicate MRSA carriage in hemodialysis patients. Data are not available demonstrating effectiveness of decolonization on reducing MRSA infections. However, a separate systematic review and meta-analysis found an 82% reduction in the risk of S. aureus bacteremia, comparing those who did and did not receive mupirocin.
Decolonization should be strongly considered as part of a multimodal approach to control MRSA outbreaks. (Quality of evidence: MODERATE) Although no clinical trials have tested strategies to control MRSA outbreaks, many quasi-experimental studies have demonstrated successful outbreak control that includes MRSA decolonization as part of a multimodal approach to reduce MRSA transmission and infection. In outbreak situations, decolonization can protect colonized individuals from infection and reduce colonization pressure that may promote transmission. Intranasal therapy reduces infection risk for individual patients. Topical skin decontamination reduces bioburden and helps reduce organism transmission. Decolonization can be implemented universally or in combination with AST In an outbreak setting, active surveillance cultures can help measure the extent of organism spread in the unit and provide organisms for strain typing. In addition to identifying patients as a reservoir for propagating outbreaks, successful outbreak control may involve screening HCP to detect reservoirs, especially in high-risk units like the neonatal ICU and burn units.HCP have been implicated as reservoirs for MRSA transmission during adult hospital unit and NICU outbreaks and during times of ongoing clonal transmission. After implementation and failure of other basic MRSA prevention and control measures (eg, hand hygiene, contact precautions, enhanced environmental cleaning, screening and decolonizing neonates), screening and decolonizing HCWs has helped successfully control MRSA outbreaks in adult units and NICUs. –

Neutropenic fever skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) — episode classification and empiric spectrum are described as follows: An "initial" episode refers to the first episode of neutropenic fever requiring systemic antimicrobial therapy, whereas a "persisting episode" is "persistent neutropenic fever unresponsive to broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy beyond days 4–7", and episodes may also be recurrent. During the initial episode, "gram-negative bacteria should be primarily targeted by the initial antibiotic regimen because they are associated with high mortality rates", and although gram-positive bacteria are more common, "the addition of antibiotics with gram- positive activity including MRSA is not recommended unless physical findings suggestive of inflammation in the skin and soft tissues are present, the patient is hemodynamically unstable, and risk factors for MRSA are present". For persistent or recurrent episodes, "antibiotic-resistant bacterial or fungal pathogens (including Candida) may be encountered".

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115SYZbY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

IDSA 2014 SSTI guideline — impetigo and ecthyma therapy notes that cultures of the vesicle fluid, pus, erosions, or ulcers establish the cause and, unless cultures yield streptococci alone, antimicrobial therapy should be active against both S. aureus and streptococci. Oral penicillinase–resistant penicillin or first-generation cephalosporins are usually effective as most staphylococcal isolates from impetigo and ecthyma are methicillin susceptible, with alternatives for penicillin-allergic patients or infections with MRSA including doxycycline, clindamycin, or SMX-TMP. When streptococci alone are the cause, penicillin is the drug of choice, with a macrolide or clindamycin as an alternative for penicillin-allergic patients. Topical treatment with mupirocin or retapamulin is as effective as oral antimicrobials for impetigo, and systemic therapy is preferred for patients with numerous lesions or in outbreaks affecting several people to help decrease transmission.

### Treatment of central line-associated bloodstream infections [^111qV6Fj]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Empirical treatment should be initiated promptly, before confirmation of the diagnosis, after appropriate cultures have been obtained. The choice is based on host characteristics, known or suspected colonization with resistant microorganisms and local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns. In general, reasonable coverage is required for common Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. Parenteral vancomycin (or daptomycin in patients with acute renal failure or when organisms have reduced susceptibility to vancomycin) is the cornerstone of an empirical regime in settings with a high prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Otherwise, an anti-staphylococcal penicillin or a first-generation cephalosporin is enough. Antibiotics active against Gram-negative bacilli include β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations, fourth-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems alone or in combination with an aminoglycoside. Agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa are required in cases of neutropaenia, severity of disease or increased probability or known prior colonization. New anti-Gram negative antibiotics are indicated for infections due to multi-drug resistant Gram-negative organisms.

Empiric coverage for candidaemia should be considered if multiple sites are colonized with Candida or for patients with bone marrow or organ transplants, hematologic malignancy, femoral catheterization or when patients are receiving total parenteral nutrition or prolonged administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Parenteral echinocandins are recommended when resistance to azoles is suspected (prior exposure to azoles in the previous 3 months or high prevalence of common non- albicans Candida such as Candida glabrata or Candida krusei). Otherwise, intravenous fluconazole is enough.

Once antimicrobial susceptibility patterns are available, de-escalation to appropriate therapy with the narrowest spectrum possible is recommended. The duration of treatment depends on the organism involved and the presence of complications or not, and varies between 7 days to 6 weeks.

For uncomplicated infection (i.e. not associated with suppurative thrombosis, endocarditis or metastatic infection) with septic manifestations resolving within 72 h of catheter removal, intravenous antimicrobial therapy is recommended for the following duration based on the organism isolated (Fig. 1):
Staphylococcus aureus: 14 days
Coagulase-negative staphylococci: 7 days
Enterococci and Gram-negative bacilli: 10 to 14 days
Candida: 14 days

Unresolved issues

Several unresolved issues remain related to MRSA and its transmission. A full discussion of these issues is beyond the scope of this document, but a brief mention of some of these important topics is worthwhile.
Universal MRSA decolonization Additional study is needed to determine the incremental benefit of the addition of mupirocin to daily chlorhexidine bathing in the adult ICU because the REDUCE MRSA study used both mupirocin and CHG for their decolonization arm. Additional study is needed to evaluate the role of routine universal decolonization of NICU patients.
Mupirocin and chlorhexidine resistance: The risk for development of resistance to mupirocin and/or chlorhexidine as they become more widely used is currently unknown, although some centers have reported increased rates of resistance. Chlorhexidine: Although some published data have demonstrated reduced susceptibility in vitro to chlorhexidine among staphylococci by at least 2 mechanisms of resistance, the definitions used in these studies often use an MIC threshold far below standard CHG applications (eg, often an MIC of 8 µg/mL is used to define "resistance", even though 2% CHG applies 20,000 µg/mL to the skin). Clinical trials have evaluated, but have not identified, the emergence of resistance to CHG. Mupirocin resistance has been studied extensively; however, the ability of hospital laboratories to provide mupirocin resistance data is limited. Mupirocin resistance is phenotypically categorized into 2 levels based on the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Low-level resistance (MICs of 8–256 mg/mL), and high-level resistance (MICs > 512 mg/mL). The molecular mechanism of low-level mupirocin resistance involves point mutations and is mediated by plasmid encoded genes in high-level mupirocin. A recent meta-analysis described a global increase in the prevalence high-level mupirocin resistance among clinical S. aureus isolates over time. Because mupirocin remains the most effective antibiotic for MSSA and MRSA decolonization, a reduction in its effectiveness presents a risk. Emergence of mupirocin resistance following increased use has not been reported consistently. The use of universal ICU decolonization with mupirocin in the REDUCE MRSA Trial was not associated with emergence of mupirocin resistance when evaluating thousands of MRSA isolates from the trial. Additional studies of mupirocin resistance have been hampered by a lack of availability of routine susceptibility testing in most hospital laboratories. Large-scale studies on decolonization failure associated with increased mupirocin use are needed to provide an understanding of the risk.
MRSA-colonized HCP: The optimal use of AST to identify asymptomatic carriage of MRSA among HCP and the optimal management (eg, decolonization therapy, follow-up monitoring) of MRSA-colonized HCP have not been definitively determined.

### Skin and soft tissue infections in the elderly [^115NBkaG]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To highlight the peculiarity of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) in elderly patients and to provide useful elements for their optimal management.

Recent Findings

In the COVID-19 era, early discharge from the hospital and implementation of outpatient management is of key importance.

Summary

Elderly patients are at high risk of SSTIs due to several factors, including presence of multiple comorbidities and skin factors predisposing to infections. Clinical presentation may be atypical and some signs of severity, such as fever and increase in C-reactive protein, may be absent or aspecific in this patients population. An appropriate diagnosis of SSTIs in the elderly is crucial to avoid antibiotic overtreatment. Further studies should explore factors associated with bacterial superinfections in patients with pressure ulcers or lower limb erythema. Since several risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) may coexist in elderly patients, these subjects should be carefully screened for MRSA risk factors and those with high risk of resistant etiology should receive early antibiotic therapy active against MRSA. Physicians should aim to several objectives, including clinical cure, patient safety, early discharge and return to community. SSTIs in the elderly may be managed using long-acting antibiotics, but clinical follow-up is needed.

### A European survey of antibiotic management of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection: current clinical opinion and practice [^117XshGh]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2010). Low credibility.

Although the epidemiology of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) varies across Europe, healthcare-associated MRSA infections are common in many countries. Despite several national guidelines, the approach to treatment of MRSA infections varies across the continent, and there are multiple areas of management uncertainty for which there is little clinical evidence to guide practice. A faculty, convened to explore some of these areas, devised a survey that was used to compare the perspectives of infection specialists from across Europe on the management of MRSA infections with those of the faculty specialists. The survey instrument, a web-based questionnaire, was sent to 3840 registered delegates of the 19th European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, held in April 2009. Of the 501 (13%) respondents to the survey, 84% were infection/microbiology specialists and 80% were from Europe. This article reports the survey results from European respondents, and shows a broad range of opinion and practice on a variety of issues pertaining to the management of minor and serious MRSA infections, such as pneumonia, bacteraemia, and skin and soft tissue infections. The issues include changing epidemiology, when and when not to treat, choice of treatment, and duration and route of treatment. The survey identified areas where practice can be improved and where further research is needed, and also identified areas of pan-European consensus of opinion that could be applied to European guidelines for the management of MRSA infection.

### Topical therapy for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization: impact on infection risk [^114P6E3D]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

We evaluated the usefulness of topical decolonization therapy for reducing the risk of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection among MRSA-colonized inpatients.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting and Intervention

Three hospitals with universal surveillance for MRSA; at their physician's discretion, colonized patients could be treated with a 5-day course of nasal mupirocin calcium 2%, twice daily, plus chlorhexidine gluconate 4% every second day.

Patients and Methods

MRSA carriers were later retested for colonization (407 subjects; study 1) or followed up for development of MRSA infection (933 subjects; study 2). Multivariable methods were used to determine the impact of decolonization therapy on the risks of sustained colonization (in study 1) and MRSA infection (in study 2).

Results

Independent risk factors for sustained colonization included residence in a long-term care facility (odds ratio [OR], 1.8 [95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1–3.2]) and a pressure ulcer (OR, 2.3 [95% CI, 1.2–4.4]). Mupirocin at any dose decreased this risk, particularly during the 30-60-day period after therapy; mupirocin resistance increased this risk (OR, 4.1 [95% CI, 1.6–10.7]). Over a median follow-up duration of 269 days, 69 (7.4%) of 933 patients developed infection. Independent risk factors for infection were length of stay (hazard ratio [HR], 1.2 per 5 additional days [95% CI, 1.0–1.4]), chronic lung disease (HR, 1.7 [95% CI, 1.0–2.8]), and receipt of non-MRSA-active systemic antimicrobial agents (HR, 1.8 [95% CI, 1.1–3.1]). Receipt of mupirocin did not affect the risk of infection, although there was a trend toward delayed infection among patients receiving mupirocin (median time to infection, 50 vs 15.5 days; P = 0.06).

Conclusions

Mupirocin-based decolonization therapy temporarily reduced the risk of continued colonization but did not decrease the risk of subsequent infection.

Most infections present as cutaneous abscess and most of these may respond to drainage alone.

The evolution of methicillin-resistant and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has demanded serious review of antimicrobial use and development of new agents and revised approaches to prevent and overcome drug resistance. Depending on local conditions and patient risk factors, empirical therapy of suspected S. aureus infection may require coverage of drug-resistant organisms with newer agents and novel antibiotic combinations. The question of treatment with inappropriate antibiotics raises grave concerns with regard to methicillin-resistant S. aureus selection, overgrowth, and increased virulence. Several strategies to reduce the nosocomial burden of resistance are suggested, including shortened hospital stays and outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy of the most serious infections.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^1152eBNE]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Executive summary

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) encompass a variety of pathological conditions involving the skin and underlying subcutaneous tissue, fascia, or muscle and ranging from simple superficial infections to severe necrotizing infections that may involve the dermal, subcutaneous, fascia, and muscle layers.

SSTIs may affect any part of the body, although the lower extremities, the perineum, and the abdominal wall are the most common sites of involvement. SSTIs are a relatively infrequent clinical problem; however, surgeons are often called upon for their management.

These guidelines focus mainly on necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs). The mortality resulting from NSTIs appears to have decreased over the past decade, possibly due to improved recognition and earlier delivery of more effective therapy.

Successful management of NSTIs involves prompt recognition, timely surgical debridement or drainage, aggressive resuscitation and appropriate antibiotic therapy.

A worldwide international panel of experts developed evidenced-based guidelines for management of soft tissue infections. The guidelines outline clinical recommendations based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) hierarchy criteria summarized in Table 1.

Table 1
Grading of recommendations from Guyatt and colleagues

Surgical site infections

1) Surgical site infections require prompt and wide opening of the surgical incision. Antimicrobial therapy is recommended for deep incisional surgical site infections if systemic signs of sepsis are present, if source control is incomplete or in immunocompromised patients (Recommendation 1 C).

2) In patients who have had clean operations, antimicrobial therapy should cover gram-positive organisms; in contrast, in patients who have had procedures on the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract antimicrobial therapy should cover both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms (Recommendation 1 C).

Non necrotizing superficial soft tissue infections

3) Erysipelas, and cellulitis are managed by antimicrobial therapy against Gram-positive bacteria (Recommendation 1 C).

4) Lack of clinical response for cellulitis may be due to resistant strains of staphylococcus or streptococcus, or deeper processes, such as necrotizing fasciitis or myonecrosis (Recommendation 1 C).

5) Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA or who do not respond to beta-lactam therapy within 48 to 72 hours (Recommendation 1 C).

6) If a streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is suspected, an antiribosomal agent such as clindamycin or linezolid can be used to reduce exotoxin and superantigen production (Recommendation 1 C).

### Linezolid [^112fdZCb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Nosocomial Pneumonia

Linezolid Injection is indicated for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible and -resistant isolates) or Streptococcus pneumoniae [see Clinical Studies (14)].

1.2 Community-acquired Pneumonia

Linezolid Injection is indicated for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, including cases with concurrent bacteremia, or Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) [see Clinical Studies (14)].

1.3 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections

Linezolid Injection is indicated for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections, including diabetic foot infections, without concomitant osteomyelitis, caused by Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible and -resistant isolates), Streptococcus pyogenes, or Streptococcus agalactiae. Linezolid Injection has not been studied in the treatment of decubitus ulcers [see Clinical Studies (14)].

1.4 Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections

Linezolid Injection is indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) or Streptococcus pyogenes [see Clinical Studies (14)].

1.5 Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium Infections

Linezolid Injection is indicated for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections, including cases with concurrent bacteremia [see Clinical Studies (14)].

1.6 Limitations of Use

- Linezolid Injection is not indicated for the treatment of Gram-negative infections. It is critical that specific Gram-negative therapy be initiated immediately if a concomitant Gram-negative pathogen is documented or suspected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- The safety and efficacy of Linezolid Injection formulations given for longer than 28 days have not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials [see Clinical Studie s (14)].

1.7 Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Linezolid Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Linezolid Injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Strength of recommendation and quality of evidence — The grading framework includes categories such as "Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence" where "Desirable effects clearly outweigh undesirable effects, or vice versa" and "Consistent evidence from well-performed RCTs or exceptionally strong evidence from unbiased observational studies", with the implication that "Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". For "Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence", "Desirable effects closely balanced with undesirable effects" and the same high-quality evidence standard apply, with the implication that "The best action may differ depending on circumstances or patient's or societal values. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". Lower-quality tiers are also detailed, including "Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence", where "Recommendation may change when higher-quality evidence becomes available", and "Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence", where "Other alternatives may be equally reasonable" and "Any estimate of effect, for at least 1 critical outcome, is very uncertain".

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of anorectal abscess, fistula-in-ano, and rectovaginal fistula [^112Ppxfq]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2022). High credibility.

Anorectal abscess — antibiotics after incision and drainage: Routine postoperative antibiotics for a routine, uncomplicated abscess in a healthy patient do not improve healing or recurrence and are typically not recommended; antibiotics may be used selectively for abscesses with cellulitis, systemic illness, or immunosuppression, and the recommendation grade was changed from 2C to 2B. Supporting data include a retrospective series of 172 patients undergoing incision and drainage with (n = 64) or without (n = 108) 5 to 7 days of oral antibiotics reporting 9% repeat surgery with no significant group difference; a single-blinded randomized trial of 307 patients found at 3 months that fistula developed in 14% with a 7-day ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole course versus 30% in controls (p < 0.001), whereas a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded multicenter trial of 334 patients showed no protective effect. Additional considerations are that methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has been reported in up to 33% of patients, for which a combination of drainage and antibiotics is typically recommended for patients with systemic signs of sepsis, leukocytosis, or leukopenia; microbial cultures should also be considered for recurrent infection or nonhealing wounds; and in immunosuppressed settings, patients with a higher absolute neutrophil count (ie, > 1000/mm3) and fluctuance typically do well with drainage, whereas those with lower counts and lack of fluctuance may initially be treated with antibiotics alone.

### Recommended treatments for community-acquired MRSA infections… [^113BHvRB]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

S. aureus treatments such as antistaphylococcal penicillins and cephalosporins, U. S. physicians have prescribed a variety of other antibiotics to treat these infections *. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is the agent most commonly used to treat adults with community-acquired MRSA infections in the United States. In vitro evidence suggests TMP/SMX has greater bactericidal activity against community-acquired MRSA than linezolid, rifampin, clindamycin, or minocycline. A retrospective review showed TMP/SMX to be effective for skin and soft-tissue infections. However, because TMP/SMX may inadequately treat group A streptococci, combining it with another antimicrobial may be preferred when the specific organism is unknown.

The ideal dosage of TMP/SMX for treating community-acquired MRSA is unknown, although one small study reported higher success rates when two double-strength pills were given twice daily, compared with one pill twice daily. Long-acting tetracyclines were successfully used in Japan for MRSA infections before the availability of vancomycin. A clinical review found response rates between 80 to 100 percent with these agents, and one small prospective trial reported a 100 percent response rate in doxycycline-treated patients after incision and drainage of MRSA abscesses. However, resistance of community-acquired MRSA to these agents has been reported on both coasts in the United States. Parenteral therapy is available for serious community-acquired MRSA infections. Vancomycin remains the first choice for MRSA therapy.

There have been reports of resistance to vancomycin through a heteroresistance mechanism, but this is not easily identified with clinical microbiology testing and requires special detection techniques. Although daptomycin has not been widely studied for treatment of community-acquired MRSA, it has recently been approved for treating bacteremia and right-sided endocarditis caused by.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^114aexux]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

NSTI type II is a mono-microbial infection. Among Gram-positive organisms, GAS remains the most common pathogen, followed by MRSA. Unlike type I infections, type II infections may occur in any age group and in persons without any underlying illness. Other pathogens include Aeromonas hydrophila and V. vulnificus. Mono-microbial necrotizing fasciitis due to Gram-negative pathogens (bacteroides and E. coli) have also been reported, though these infections are typically seen in immunocompromised, diabetic, obese, and postoperative patients.

Gas gangrene (clostridial myonecrosis), or type III NSTI, is an acute infection by clostridium or bacillus of healthy living tissue that occurs spontaneously or as a result of traumatic injury. Recurrent gas gangrene, occurring several decades after the primary infection, has also been described.

The use of antimicrobial therapy is an adjuvant treatment and must be combined with early surgical debridement. Once the diagnosis is made and blood cultures have been drawn, broad-spectrum coverage should be urgently commenced. Initial antibiotic therapy for necrotizing infections is empirical in nature because microbiological data (culture and susceptibility results) may require > 24 h before they are available for a more detailed analysis.

Since it is impossible to exclude with certainty a polymicrobial necrotizing infection, an aggressive broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial therapy should initially be selected to cover Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms until culture-specific results and sensitivities are available. An acceptable empiric antibiotic regimen should always include antibiotics, which cover MRSA with the additional benefit of inhibiting invasive GAS virulence proteins. For the treatment of MRSA, we refer to the previous paragraphs.

For the treatment of Gram-negative bacteria, the use of piperacillin-tazobactam in the setting without high local prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacateriaceae optimizing pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic parameters is appropriate. Carbapenems, administered in adequate dosage, including meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin, or doripenem may be used in the settings with high local prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacateriaceae. Culture-specific results and sensitivities can direct both broadening of antimicrobial regimen if it is too narrow and a de-escalation if it is too broad particularly in critically ill patients where de-escalation strategy is one of the cornerstones of antimicrobial stewardship programs. The choice of anti-Gram-negative treatment should be based on local prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacateriaceae and MDRO non-fermenters.

This study was a double-blind, pharmacist-unblinded, randomized trial conducted between April 2014 and March 2015 at 60 centers in the United States, Eastern Europe, Russia, and South Africa. The protocol and informed consent form were reviewed by the institutional review boards at each center, and all patients provided written informed consent.

Study Patients

Patients enrolled in the study had an ABSSSI described as either a major abscess, cellulitis, or traumatic wound/surgical site infection. All patients were required to have an area of erythema of at least 75 cm 2 associated with the infection. A major abscess by definition required surgical incision and drainage and the erythema was to extend for at least 5 cm in all directions beyond the central area of induration. A traumatic wound/surgical site infection required 5 cm of erythema beyond the margin of the wound. In addition to erythema, patients were required to have other local signs or symptoms such as warmth, tenderness/pain, fluctuance, swelling, and drainage, as well as at least 1 systemic sign including a white blood cell count > 12 000 cells/µL, ≥ 10% immature neutrophils on peripheral smear, or a temperature ≥ 38°C within the prior 24 hours. Patients could not have taken antibiotics in the prior 14 days except for a single dose of a short-half-life drug. There was no exclusion for patients with liver function abnormalities or renal insufficiency. Excluded were patients with catheter infection, infected devices, diabetic foot ulceration, perirectal abscess, or decubitus ulcer.

Regarding medical management for cellulitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, MRSA coverage, SIS-E/WSES 2018 guidelines recommend to administer antibiotics directed against MRSA as an adjunct to incision and drainage based on local epidemiology (area with > 20% of MRSA in invasive hospital isolates or high circulation of MRSA in the community), specific risk factors for MRSA, and clinical conditions.

Importantly, the guidelines recommend that antibiotic prophylaxis should be used to prevent infections before and during surgery only. Antibiotics should not be used after surgery, as is often done. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered for operative procedures that have a high rate of postoperative surgical site infection, or when foreign materials are implanted. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered within 120 min prior to the incision. However, administration of the first dose of antibiotics is dependent on its pharmacological characteristics. Underlying patient factors may also affect drug disposition (e.g. malnourishment, obesity, cachexia, and renal disease with protein loss may result in suboptimal antibiotic exposure through increased antibiotic clearance in the presence of normal or augmented renal function). Additional antibiotic doses should be administered intraoperatively for procedures > 2–4 h (typically where duration exceeds two half-lives of the antibiotic). There is no evidence to support the use of postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The key evidence-based recommendations outlined in these guidelines should be adopted by all healthcare staff that care for surgical patients throughout all stages of that patient's surgical care.

### American College of Foot and Ankle SurgeonsClinical consensus statement: perioperative management [^111EChKw]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons clinical consensus — preoperative methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) decontamination protocols lack clear support for routine use. The panel reached consensus that the statement "Preoperative methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus decontamination protocols should be performed before elective foot and ankle surgical procedures" was "neither appropriate nor inappropriate", noting evidence that a single preoperative chlorhexidine bath 20 minutes before elective foot surgery showed no difference in the incidence of surgical site infections (SSIs) between control and intervention groups, a Cochrane review of 10,157 participants did not demonstrate substantial evidence for chlorhexidine showering or bathing, and a meta-analysis reviewed 16 trials with 19,372 patients finding chlorhexidine bathing did not reduce the incidence of SSIs compared with other approaches.

Methods

Records of all adult patients hospitalized at least once from January 2003 through June 2004 in 3 wards (internal medicine, family medicine, gastroenterology) and a random sample of 50% of patients in the general surgery ward were retrospectively reviewed. For each patient, records of all admissions during this period were examined. To deal with multiple hospitalizations and repeated exposures, we used episodes of care (EOC) as the unit for all analyses. When intervals between hospital admissions were < 60 days, distinct hospitalizations were considered as a single EOC and duration of stay was the sum of each admission within that EOC. Hospitalizations > 60 days apart were defined as separate EOCs. We excluded hospitalizations for which the primary reason for admission was S. aureus infection or during which S. aureus infection was documented within 72 hours of admission.

The following data were collected for each patient: sociodemographic information, discharge diagnoses and concurrent illnesses, pharmaceutical drugs given, and laboratory test results. Receipt of antimicrobial drugs while in the hospital was abstracted from computerized medical records. When possible, receipt of antimicrobial drugs as outpatient therapy in the 2 months before the EOC was abstracted from the admission note. The overall amount of concurrent illness was measured according to the Charlson index. A patient with any of the following was considered immunosuppressed: HIV infection, leukemia, lymphoma, neutropenia, organ transplant, or other indications for receiving immunosuppressive drugs or systemic corticosteroids for > 1 month. Potential outcomes were identified through a review of a laboratory database of clinical specimens (infections with MSSA or MRSA) and of the hospital's computerized database (MRSA colonization). When MRSA infection or colonization or MSSA infection developed, data with regard to risk factors were collected from date of first admission up to the date of microbiologic and clinical diagnosis. A case of nosocomial MRSA or MSSA infection was defined by 1) a positive S. aureus culture from a site considered infected by the treating physicians and for which antimicrobial drug therapy active against the pathogen was initiated or surgical drainage was performed and 2) occurrence of the above during an EOC or within 60 days of date of last discharge after an EOC. Patients were considered to have MRSA colonization if MRSA was recovered in a surveillance sample or in a clinical sample and the patient had not received vancomycin, linezolid, or cotrimoxazole. Patients for whom MSSA was found in a specimen but for whom no antistaphylococcal drug had been prescribed and for whom no surgical drainage had been performed were considered to have MSSA colonization and were not analyzed further.

Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be added for patients at risk for CA-MRSA and subsequently for patients who do not respond to beta-lactam therapy within 48 to 72 hours or who have chills, fever, a new abscess, increasing erythema, or uncontrolled pain.

Although in cellulitis, swabs and aspirates of the leading edge of the site of infection have a low yield of around 10%, when it is possible, antibiotic treatment should be modified, on the basis of antimicrobial susceptibilities of organisms obtained.

Simple abscesses

7) Incision and drainage is the primary treatment for a simple abscesses or boils. Antibiotics are not needed (Recommendation 1 C).

For a simple superficial abscess or boil, incision and drainage is the primary treatment, and antibiotics are not needed. Simple abscesses should not have extension into deeper tissues or multiloculated extension.

Complex abscesses

8) Complex skin and subcutaneous abscesses are typically well circumscribed and respond to incision and drainage. Antimicrobial therapy is required if systemic signs of sepsis are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete or for the abscesses with significant cellulitis (Recommendation 1 C).

9) Empiric antibiotic therapy should be directed toward the likely pathogens involved.

Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA (Recommendation 1 C).

10) Inadequate resolution should prompt consideration of further drainage, resistant pathogens, or host immune failure (Recommendation 1 C).

The cornerstone of treatment is early surgical drainage. Antimicrobial therapy is required if systemic signs of sepsis are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete or for the abscesses with significant cellulitis.

Complicated abscesses may involve a variety of pathogens. Aerobic gram-positive pathogens are isolated in most complicated abscesses. They may involve only a single pathogen but are frequently poly-microbial in origin and may involve a number of organisms.

Empiric antibiotic therapy should be directed toward the likely pathogens involved. Broad-spectrum agents with coverage of gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic pathogens may be required depending on the clinical setting. Given the high frequency of MRSA, this pathogen should be empirically covered if it is suspected, but no randomized studies are available for the treatment of SSTI specifically caused by CA-MRSA.

### Daptomycin (Cubicin RF) [^112PuFM5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.4	Microbiology

Daptomycin belongs to the cyclic lipopeptide class of antibacterials. Daptomycin has clinical utility in the treatment of infections caused by aerobic, Gram-positive bacteria. The in vitro spectrum of activity of daptomycin encompasses most clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria.

Daptomycin exhibits rapid, concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria in vitro. This has been demonstrated both by time-kill curves and by MBC/MIC (minimum bactericidal concentration/minimum inhibitory concentration) ratios using broth dilution methodology. Daptomycin maintained bactericidal activity in vitro against stationary phase S. aureus in simulated endocardial vegetations. The clinical significance of this is not known.

Mechanism of Action

Daptomycin binds to bacterial cell membranes and causes a rapid depolarization of membrane potential. This loss of membrane potential causes inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, which results in bacterial cell death.

Resistance

The mechanism(s) of daptomycin resistance is not fully understood. Currently, there are no known transferable elements that confer resistance to daptomycin.

Interactions with Other Antibacterials

In vitro studies have investigated daptomycin interactions with other antibacterials. Antagonism, as determined by kill curve studies, has not been observed. In vitro synergistic interactions of daptomycin with aminoglycosides, β-lactam antibacterials, and rifampin have been shown against some isolates of staphylococci (including some methicillin-resistant isolates) and enterococci (including some vancomycin-resistant isolates).

Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infection (cSSSI) Trials in Adults

The emergence of daptomycin non-susceptible isolates occurred in 2 infected patients across the set of Phase 2 and pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials of cSSSI in adult patients. In one case, a non-susceptible S. aureus was isolated from a patient in a Phase 2 trial who received CUBICIN at less than the protocol-specified dose for the initial 5 days of therapy. In the second case, a non-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis was isolated from a patient with an infected chronic decubitus ulcer who was enrolled in a salvage trial.

S. aureus Bacteremia/Endocarditis and Other Post-Approval Trials in Adults

In subsequent clinical trials in adult patients, non-susceptible isolates were recovered. S. aureus was isolated from a patient in a compassionate-use trial and from 7 patients in the S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. An E. faecium was isolated from a patient in a vancomycin-resistant enterococci trial.

### Current guidelines and recommendations for the management of skin and soft tissue infections [^117MabCv]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The incidence of severe skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) has significantly increased over the last years. In addition, major ecological changes have been reported with the emergence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), involved in a large proportion of these cases. A large number of expert opinions, guidelines, and recommendations for the management of SSTIs have been published over the last decade. The purpose of this review is to compare these guidelines.

Recent Findings

A total of six official publications have presented recommendations for the management of SSTIs. During the same period, other guidelines for the management of MRSA infections have also been published, including some recommendations for SSTIs.

Summary

The applicability of the guidelines is questionable in many ways. The distinction between necrotizing/nonnecrotizing infections is valuable but difficult to apply prior to surgical management. The prescribers should choose a pragmatic approach to empirical antibiotic therapy, taking into account the patient's initial severity, the extent of infection and risk factors for resistant microorganisms essentially related to healthcare-associated circumstances.
