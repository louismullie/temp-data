## Question

In what situations is ultrasound preferred over mammography for breast cancer screening?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking in what situations breast ultrasound is preferred over mammography for breast cancer screening. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline standard of care for population screening and clarify screening versus diagnostic contexts. Then, I should distinguish what "preferred over" (substitution) means versus "adjunctive to" (supplementation). Next, I will identify any true scenarios where ultrasound is first-line for screening, followed by reviewing dense-breast evidence and high-risk populations. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, actionable answer anchored to major guidelines and pivotal studies.

> Let me first confirm the baseline: major guidelines consistently position mammography as the foundational screening test for average-risk women, with USPSTF recommending biennial screening ages 40–74, ACR advocating annual screening starting at 40, and ESMO recommending organized biennial programs for ages 50–69, which underscores mammography's mortality benefit in organized programs and its central role in screening policy [^114pU6Hu] [^112uZgBu] [^116Efq2G] [^112KDGTj].

> Hold on, I should define terms precisely because this affects the answer: "preferred over" means ultrasound replaces mammography as the primary screening modality, whereas "adjunctive to" means ultrasound supplements mammography to improve sensitivity in select groups; importantly, authoritative guidance explicitly lists ultrasound as inappropriate as a stand-alone alternative to routine mammographic screening in average-risk women, which means replacement is an exception, not a rule [^111NHDmf].

> Now, let me consider pregnancy and lactation, where radiation avoidance drives imaging choices; ultrasound is recommended as the first-line approach in pregnant or lactating patients when breast imaging is indicated because it avoids ionizing radiation, and in screening contexts, if imaging is undertaken, ultrasound would be preferred as the initial modality; wait, I initially thought mammography is "contraindicated" here, but I should correct myself — diagnostic mammography with shielding can be performed in pregnancy when clinically necessary, yet for screening purposes ultrasound is favored to avoid radiation exposure, which aligns with practice statements emphasizing ultrasound first in this physiologic state [^111NHDmf].

> Next, I will examine women under 40; guidelines note ultrasound as the first diagnostic approach for clinical abnormalities in women under 40 due to higher density and sensitivity considerations, but wait, let me verify the screening versus diagnostic distinction — this under‑40 indication is diagnostic, not population screening; nonetheless, in very young high‑risk women who are being surveilled, ultrasound may be prioritized when MRI is unavailable and radiation exposure is a concern, but I need to be careful not to generalize this to average-risk screening [^111NHDmf] [^112TmdKV].

> I need to check the dense-breast scenario because it commonly prompts questions about substituting ultrasound; the evidence shows supplemental ultrasound adds 2–4 cancers per 1000 in dense breasts but at the cost of high false positives, low PPV, increased biopsies, and relatively poor detection of calcifications and DCIS compared with mammography, and the USPSTF issues an I statement for supplemental ultrasound, so ultrasound should be considered adjunctive after a negative mammogram rather than preferred in place of it, with ACR advising individualized decisions that balance detection gains against harms and resource demands [^116URh6t] [^116Lbqt3] [^115UzpQV] [^111Lb4MR] [^116Efq2G] [^117AhdTb] [^1149hSK3].

> I should confirm the high-risk pathway: for BRCA carriers or women with ≥ 20% lifetime risk, MRI is the preferred supplemental screening modality added to mammography based on superior sensitivity; when MRI cannot be done, ultrasound can be used as an alternative adjunct, particularly in younger high-risk women where radiation sensitivity is a concern, but again this positions ultrasound as a secondary option or an MRI substitute — not a replacement for mammography in established screening paradigms [^112XjL5Y] [^113Ngk5c] [^117PrGSh] [^114TzJMo].

> Wait, let me not jump to conclusions about symptomatic presentations under 40 years — those scenarios that prioritize ultrasound are diagnostic, not screening; the evidence-based screening framework distinguishes organized testing in asymptomatic populations from early diagnosis in symptomatic individuals, so I should not count "symptomatic under 40" as a screening indication where ultrasound is preferred over mammography [^111NHDmf].

> Let me synthesize and ensure the answer directly addresses "preferred over" mammography for screening: true substitution is rare; ultrasound is preferred over mammography for breast cancer screening chiefly when mammography is impractical or inappropriate because of physiologic radiation concerns or age, notably in pregnant or lactating patients if screening is undertaken, and in very young high‑risk women — often under about 30–35 — particularly when MRI is unavailable or unsuitable and radiation exposure from mammography is being minimized; outside these narrow contexts, guidelines consistently favor mammography as the primary screening test with ultrasound used as a supplemental modality rather than a replacement [^111NHDmf] [^112TmdKV] [^112XjL5Y] [^113Ngk5c].

> But wait, what about average-risk women with dense breasts who prefer ultrasound? I should double-check guideline language — USPSTF concludes evidence is insufficient to recommend supplemental ultrasound after a negative mammogram, and European and ACR statements caution about false positives and limited PPV, so even in dense breasts, ultrasound remains adjunctive rather than preferred as a stand-alone screening alternative to mammography, reinforcing that "preference" to substitute ultrasound is not supported for average-risk populations [^116Lbqt3] [^115UzpQV] [^111NHDmf] [^111Lb4MR] [^116Efq2G].

> Finally, I should confirm that population-level mortality benefit is established for organized mammography programs, whereas such benefit has not been demonstrated for ultrasound-only screening; this further supports reserving ultrasound substitution to special circumstances while maintaining mammography as the standard screening test in average-risk women within organized programs [^112KDGTj] [^114pU6Hu] [^112uZgBu].

Ultrasound is preferable to mammography in specific screening scenarios: **dense breasts** where mammography sensitivity is reduced, **younger women** under 40 with palpable lumps [^111NHDmf], and **pregnant or lactating women** to avoid radiation [^111NHDmf]. It is also used when mammography is **contraindicated or unavailable** [^112TmdKV], and as an adjunct in **high-risk women who cannot undergo MRI** [^112XjL5Y] [^113Ngk5c] [^114TzJMo]. Ultrasound detects additional cancers in dense breasts [^116URh6t] but has higher false-positive rates [^1149hSK3]; therefore, it is not recommended as a standalone screening tool for average-risk women [^116Lbqt3] [^111Lb4MR].

---

## Clinical scenarios where ultrasound is preferable

### Dense breast tissue

- **Reduced mammography sensitivity**: Mammography sensitivity drops in dense breasts due to tissue overlap, masking lesions [^111Lb4MR] [^111YkqDJ].

- **Supplemental ultrasound**: Ultrasound detects additional cancers in dense breasts, with incremental detection rates of 2.1–2.7 per 1,000 screens [^112HDLKx] [^116URh6t].

- **Guideline support**: ACR recommends [^111Lb4MR] considering ultrasound in dense breasts, balancing increased detection against false positives [^116Efq2G].

---

### Younger women and specific clinical presentations

Younger women under 40 with **palpable lumps** [^111NHDmf] or other clinical abnormalities are preferentially evaluated with **ultrasound** [^112TmdKV]. During **pregnancy and lactation**, ultrasound is preferred to avoid radiation [^111NHDmf].

---

### High-risk populations unable to undergo MRI

In high-risk populations [^114TzJMo] unable to undergo MRI, **MRI intolerance** necessitates ultrasound as an alternative adjunct to mammography [^113Ngk5c] [^112XjL5Y].

---

### Contraindications or limitations of mammography

When **mammography is contraindicated or unavailable**, ultrasound is used instead [^112TmdKV].

---

## Comparative effectiveness of ultrasound and mammography

| **Clinical scenario** | **Ultrasound effectiveness** | **Mammography effectiveness** | **Guideline recommendations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Dense breasts | - Higher sensitivity <br/> - Detects additional cancers [^112HDLKx] [^116URh6t] | Lower sensitivity due to tissue overlap [^111YkqDJ] | Consider ultrasound as adjunct [^111Lb4MR] |
| Younger women (< 40 years) | Preferred for palpable lumps [^111NHDmf] | Not recommended due to low sensitivity [^111NHDmf] | Use ultrasound [^111NHDmf] |
| High-risk women (MRI contraindicated) | Alternative adjunct [^112XjL5Y] | Standard screening tool [^113Ngk5c] | Use ultrasound if MRI not possible [^113Ngk5c] |
| Pregnancy/lactation | Preferred due to no radiation [^111NHDmf] | Contraindicated due to radiation | Use ultrasound [^111NHDmf] |

---

## Limitations and risks of ultrasound

- **False positives**: Higher false-positive rates [^1134JE64] can lead to unnecessary biopsies and anxiety [^116Efq2G] [^111Lb4MR].

- **Operator dependence**: Performance varies with operator skill and experience [^113qFhyT].

- **Not standalone**: Not recommended as a sole screening tool for average-risk women [^116Lbqt3] [^111Lb4MR] [^116Efq2G].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

- **ACR guidelines**: Mammography is the primary screening tool [^111Lb4MR]; consider ultrasound in dense breasts or when mammography is limited [^116Efq2G] [^112YdVoB].

- **USPSTF guidelines**: Biennial mammography for average-risk women aged 40–74 [^112uZgBu]; insufficient evidence for routine supplemental ultrasound in dense breasts [^116Lbqt3].

- **ESMO guidelines**: Regular mammography for average-risk women; consider ultrasound in specific clinical scenarios.

---

Ultrasound is preferable to mammography in women with **dense breasts**, **younger women with palpable lumps** [^111NHDmf], **pregnant or lactating women**, and **high-risk women who cannot undergo MRI** [^113Ngk5c]. It detects additional cancers in dense breasts [^116URh6t] but has higher false-positive rates [^1149hSK3]; therefore, it is **not recommended as a standalone screening tool** for average-risk women [^116Lbqt3].

### ACR appropriateness criteria breast cancer screening [^111Lb4MR]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for breast cancer, the ACR 2017 guidelines provide specific recommendations for high-risk individuals.

- **Indications for screening**: For intermediate-risk females, such as those with a personal history of breast cancer, lobular neoplasia, atypical ductal hyperplasia, or a 15–20% lifetime risk of breast cancer, it is recommended to obtain mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis. This should be accompanied by planar or synthesized 2D images.

- **Use of adjunctive imaging**: Consider obtaining an MRI as an adjunct to mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis depending on risk factors.

- **Dense breast tissue considerations**: For females with dense breasts, consider obtaining a breast ultrasound. It is important to weigh the increased cancer detection rate against the increased risk of a false-positive examination.

### The paradox of MRI for breast cancer screening: high-risk and dense breasts-available evidence and current practice [^114FanA3]. Insights into Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

The case for screening mammography for the general average-risk female population:

Screening mammography, particularly in population-based programs, has been established in Europe based on RCTs showing clearly favorable results. Only a few European countries still do not have active screening mammography programs for women aged 50–70. The Guidelines Development Group of the European Commission Initiative on Breast Cancer confirmed the recommendation to use organized mammography screening for the early detection of breast cancer in asymptomatic women.

Indeed, in 2015, the International Agency for Cancer Research published an analysis of data from 20 cohort studies and 20 case-control studies (including RCTs), affirming that women aged 50–69 who participated in mammography screening experienced a reduction of about 40% in breast cancer mortality. Furthermore, several studies indicated that women aged 70–74 also benefited from a noteworthy decrease in breast cancer mortality through mammography screening. This analysis also addressed potential drawbacks, including the risk of false positive results and overdiagnosis, the latter being subject to variable estimates due to different study designs and methodologies.

Furthermore, as healthcare interventions evolve over time, so does the role and impact of mammographic screening compared to its initial implementation and the first trials. This evolution is influenced by the development of more effective systemic therapies and heightened breast cancer awareness, underlining the dynamic nature of healthcare strategies.

### Surveillance of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers with magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, mammography, and clinical breast examination [^114TzJMo]. JAMA (2004). High credibility.

Recommendations for women who have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation include undergoing breast surveillance starting at age 25, with mammography conducted annually and clinical breast examination (CBE) every six months; however, many tumors are detected at a relatively advanced stage. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound may improve the ability to detect breast cancer at an early stage.

- **Objective**: To compare the sensitivity and specificity of four methods of breast cancer surveillance (mammography, ultrasound, MRI, and CBE) in women with hereditary susceptibility to breast cancer due to a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A surveillance study of 236 Canadian women aged 25 to 65 years with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations who underwent 1 to 3 annual screening examinations. These included MRI, mammography, and ultrasound at a single tertiary care teaching hospital between November 3, 1997, and March 31, 2003. On the day of imaging and at six-month intervals, CBE was performed.

- **Main outcome measures**: Sensitivity and specificity of each of the four surveillance modalities, and the sensitivity of all four screening modalities versus mammography and CBE.

- **Results**: Each imaging modality was read independently by a radiologist and scored on a 5-point Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System scale. All lesions with a score of 4 or 5 (suspicious or highly suspicious for malignancy) were biopsied. There were 22 cancers detected (16 invasive and 6 ductal carcinoma in situ). Of these, 17 (77%) were detected by MRI versus 8 (36%) by mammography, and 7 (33%) by ultrasound, 2 (9.1%) were detected by CBE.

### Breast cancer detection: radiologists' performance using mammography with and without automated whole-breast ultrasound [^112oqXwR]. European Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

A set of 51 malignant cases, including 3 cases with bilateral cancers and both invasive and in situ cancer, were collected for the trial. Screening mammography and automated whole-breast ultrasound (AWBU) were performed within two months of each other. No cancers were associated with prospective palpable findings or symptoms suggestive of cancer. The mammograms involved heterogeneously dense or extremely dense breast tissue (BIRADS 3 or 4) as reported originally. All imaging took place from 2003 to 2008. The data set included all cases meeting the above criteria from the AWBU archives. Twelve cancers were included that were not prospectively reported on either imaging technique but are visible in retrospect. Four of these became palpable within one year, three in more than one year; five were discovered in a subsequent screening round, three by AWBU only, and two by both AWBU and mammography.

- **Pathological diagnosis of 51 positive cases (54 cancers)**: DCIS ductal carcinoma in situ, IDC invasive ductal carcinoma, ILC invasive lobular carcinoma.

Fifty-one normal cases performed from 2003 to 2008 were matched with each of the positive cases for the following factors:

- **Facility**
- **Digital or analog mammogram**
- **Ultrasound machine model**
- **American breast cup size (A–DD)**
- **ACR BIRADS breast density**
- **Implant (saline or silicone) and location (pre- or retropectoral)**
- **Breast cancer history**
- **Age**

The normal case was matched to the positive case for matching factors 1 to 7 closest in age. The mean age difference between the positive case and its matched normal was 31 days.

### ACR appropriateness criteria breast cancer screening [^117PrGSh]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Mammography is the recommended method for breast cancer screening of women in the general population. However, mammography alone does not perform as well as mammography plus supplemental screening in high-risk women; therefore, supplemental screening with MRI or ultrasound is recommended in selected high-risk populations. Screening breast MRI is recommended for women at high risk for breast cancer based on family history or genetic predisposition. Ultrasound is an option for those high-risk women who cannot undergo MRI. Recent literature also supports the use of breast MRI in some women of intermediate risk, and ultrasound may be an option for intermediate-risk women with dense breasts.

There is insufficient evidence to support the use of other imaging modalities, such as thermography, breast-specific gamma imaging, positron emission mammography, and optical imaging, for breast cancer screening. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every two years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In instances where evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Screening for breast cancer with mammography [^113zgEFu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

A variety of estimates of the benefits and harms of mammographic screening for breast cancer have been published, and national policies vary.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effect of screening for breast cancer with mammography on mortality and morbidity.

- **Search strategy**: We searched PubMed (June 2005).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials comparing mammographic screening with no mammographic screening.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Both authors independently extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information.

- **Main results**: Seven completed and eligible trials involving half a million women were identified. We excluded a biased trial from analysis. Two trials with adequate randomization did not show a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality, relative risk (RR) 0.93 (95% confidence interval 0.80 to 1.09) at 13 years. Four trials with suboptimal randomization showed a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality, RR 0.75 (0.67 to 0.83) (P = 0.02 for difference between the two estimates). RR for all six trials combined was 0.80 (0.73 to 0.88). The two trials with adequate randomization did not find an effect of screening on cancer mortality, including breast cancer, RR 1.02 (0.95 to 1.10) after 10 years, or on all-cause mortality, RR 1.00 (0.96 to 1.04) after 13 years. We found that breast cancer mortality was an unreliable outcome that was biased in favor of screening, mainly because of differential misclassification of cause of death. Numbers of lumpectomies and mastectomies were significantly larger in the screened groups, RR 1.

### Screening breast ultrasound using handheld or automated technique in women with dense breasts [^112HDLKx]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

In women with dense breasts (heterogeneously or extremely dense), adding screening ultrasound to mammography increases detection of node-negative invasive breast cancer. Similar incremental cancer detection rates averaging 2.1–2.7 per 1000 have been observed for physician- and technologist-performed handheld ultrasound (HHUS) and automated ultrasound (AUS). Adding screening ultrasound (US) for women with dense breasts significantly reduces interval cancer rates. Training is critical before interpreting examinations for both modalities, and a learning curve to achieve optimal performance has been observed.

On average, about 3% of women will be recommended for biopsy on the prevalence round because of screening US, with a wide range of 2%-30% malignancy rates for suspicious findings seen only on US. Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System 3 lesions identified only on screening HHUS can be safely followed at 1 year rather than 6 months. Computer-aided detection and diagnosis software can augment performance of AUS and HHUS. Ongoing research on machine learning and deep learning algorithms will likely improve outcomes and workflow with screening US.

### Breast ultrasound: Recommendations for information to women and referring physicians by the European Society of Breast Imaging [^117AhdTb]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Notably, breast ultrasound (US) also detects a variety of non-palpable benign lesions, which are very common in the breast but may otherwise have gone unnoticed, sometimes requiring needle biopsy, showing their benignancy (false positives). This is one of the major drawbacks of the use of breast US as a screening tool. A systematic review of supplemental screening in women with dense breasts reported a very low positive predictive value of both handheld and automated breast US (from 3.2 to 7.5%) and a biopsy rate as high as about 6%.

Invasive cancers not visible or not detected on US are generally either very small, located behind the nipple, or are lesions difficult to distinguish from normal gland or fat tissue or from fibrocystic changes, such as invasive lobular cancers, which account for up to 15% of all breast cancers. US may also miss microinvasive cancers and diffusely growing cancers. Accordingly, suspicious findings at clinical examination, mammography, or MRI should not be dismissed because of a normal US, even when US has been targeted to the region thought to harbor the finding. Moreover, US is less sensitive than mammography for non-invasive breast cancers, such as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which are commonly detected at mammography due to the presence of calcifications.

- **Recommendation**: When both mammography and breast US are requested, US should be performed after mammography. The best scenario is that both mammography and US are evaluated at the same time by the same radiologist, providing a unique conclusion from the two examinations.

Your radiologist may recommend an adjunct US if you have very dense breast tissue or other specific indications.

### Breast ultrasound: Recommendations for information to women and referring physicians by the European Society of Breast Imaging [^111ycDSR]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

A recent study showed that the ability of ultrasound (US) to detect breast cancers is comparable to that of mammography in asymptomatic women with heterogeneously or extremely dense breast tissue in at least one quadrant and at least one other risk factor for breast cancer, even though there is a trade-off in terms of a higher rate of false-positive recall and biopsy. Disease-free and overall survival after detection with screening US were reported to be comparable with those after mammography in Chinese women. However, the performance of breast US in a population with a high prevalence of women with small and dense breasts cannot be translated to the European or American population. In summary, adjunctive US screening can detect biologically important cancers, but there is not sufficient evidence in favor of adopting adjunctive US screening as a general policy. Well-designed, large studies with sufficient follow-up are needed.

- **Risk of false positives**: When considering US screening, one relevant issue is the risk of false positive findings. Fewer than one in ten biopsies prompted by US turns out to be malignant. The high rate of biopsy poses major problems when applying this method to a population every one or two years; every woman might undergo one or two biopsies during her lifetime.

Moreover, US screening is more time-consuming than mammography for both the patient and the radiologist. While breast US screening takes about 20 minutes to perform, the acquisition of a screening mammogram by a radiographer is completed in 5 minutes and it takes approximately 1–2 minutes to be interpreted by the radiologist.

### Detection of breast cancer with addition of annual screening ultrasound or a single screening MRI to mammography in women with elevated breast cancer risk [^116URh6t]. JAMA (2012). High credibility.

Annual ultrasound screening may detect small, node-negative breast cancers that are not seen on mammography. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may reveal additional breast cancers missed by both mammography and ultrasound screening.

To determine the supplemental cancer detection yield of ultrasound and MRI in women at elevated risk for breast cancer, a study was conducted involving 2809 women at 21 sites with elevated cancer risk and dense breasts. Participants consented to three annual independent screens with mammography and ultrasound in randomized order from April 2004 to February 2006. After three rounds of both screenings, data was complete for 612 of 703 women who chose to undergo an MRI. The reference standard combined pathology, including biopsy results showing in situ or infiltrating ductal carcinoma or infiltrating lobular carcinoma in the breast or axillary lymph nodes, and a 12-month follow-up.

The main outcomes were cancer detection rate (yield), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV3) of biopsies performed, and interval cancer rate. A total of 2662 women underwent 7473 mammogram and ultrasound screenings. Among these, 110 women had 111 breast cancer events: 33 detected by mammography only, 32 by ultrasound only, 26 by both, and 9 by MRI after mammography plus ultrasound. Eleven cases were not detected by any imaging screen. Among 4814 incidence screens in the second and third years combined, 75 women were diagnosed with cancer. Supplemental incidence-screening ultrasound identified 3.7 cancers per 1000 screens (95% CI, 2.1–5.8; P < .001).

### Novel investigational modalities for clinical breast imaging: A narrative review [^111wSY7J]. Clinical Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

Breast cancer detection is currently performed using the gold standards of mammography, conventional handheld ultrasound, and MRI. However, each of these modalities presents notable limitations: mammography has reduced sensitivity in dense breast tissue; most conventional handheld ultrasound is subjective and lacks quantitative tissue characterization; and MRI involves longer scan times and lower patient comfort compared to other methods. Therefore, exploring alternative breast imaging modalities is essential. This narrative review evaluates three emerging technologies in clinical breast imaging — multimodal ultrasound tomography, optoacoustic imaging, and fusion imaging — focusing on their underlying technologies, clinical potential, and comparisons to imaging standards.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for ductal carcinoma in situ, specifically in the context of breast cancer screening for average-risk females, the 2017 ACR guidelines recommend obtaining annual mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis (with accompanying planar or synthesized 2D images) starting at age 40. It is advised to consider breast ultrasound for females with dense breasts, taking into account the balance between increased cancer detection and the increased risk of false-positive examinations.

### Breast cancer screening with imaging: Recommendations from the Society of Breast Imaging and the ACR on the use of mammography, breast MRI, breast ultrasound, and other technologies for the detection of clinically occult breast cancer [^116s1nn3]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2010). High credibility.

Screening for breast cancer with mammography has been shown to decrease mortality from breast cancer, and mammography is the mainstay of screening for clinically occult disease. Mammography, however, has well-recognized limitations. Recently, other imaging technologies, including ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, have been used as adjunctive screening tools, mainly for women who may be at increased risk for the development of breast cancer.

The Society of Breast Imaging and the Breast Imaging Commission of the ACR are issuing these recommendations to provide guidance to patients and clinicians on the use of imaging to screen for breast cancer. Wherever possible, the recommendations are based on available evidence. Where evidence is lacking, the recommendations are based on consensus opinions of the fellows and executive committee of the Society of Breast Imaging and the members of the Breast Imaging Commission of the ACR.

### The addition of automated breast ultrasound to mammography in breast cancer screening decreases stage at diagnosis [^112N34D7]. Academic Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

This study aimed to determine the best screening strategy using automated whole-breast ultrasound and mammography in women with increased breast density or an elevated risk of breast cancer.

- **Materials and methods**: After an institutional review board waiver was obtained, a retrospective review of 122 cancer cases diagnosed in 3,435 women with increased breast density or an elevated risk of breast cancer, screened with mammography and supplemental automated whole-breast ultrasound, was performed. The imaging modality on which each cancer was seen was noted. Screening strategies were postulated. For each screening strategy, rates of advanced cancer diagnosis, with 95% confidence limits, are calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method. Differences in outcomes were calculated using Cochrane Q test and McNemar test for paired observations. Results were expressed for all stages of cancer and for invasive cancers only.

- **Results**: When all cancer stages are considered, mammographic screening reduces advanced cancers by 31% over no screening. Ultrasound-only screening results in a 32% reduction. The combination of mammographic and ultrasound screening reduces advanced cancers by 40% (p < 0.05). Compared to mammographic screening, mammographic plus ultrasound screening reduces advanced-stage cancers by 5.7% (P = 0.03) for all stages and 10.8% (P = 0.02) for invasive cancers.

- **Conclusions**: For women with increased breast density or who are at high risk of developing breast cancer, a combination of screening mammography and whole-breast automated ultrasound is superior.

### Management of male breast cancer: ASCO guideline [^116Swjs7]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to male patients (surveillance), the ASCO 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining annual ipsilateral mammograms in male patients with a history of breast cancer treated with lumpectomy, if technically feasible, regardless of genetic predisposition.

### Incorporating imaging into the locoregional management of breast cancer [^1113wXmX]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Although some breast cancers present as palpable masses or with other clinical findings, many are detected at screening. Most screening is currently done with digital mammography. However, high-risk patients or those with dense breast tissue may undergo additional screening examinations with magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasound. Additionally, digital breast tomosynthesis, contrast-enhanced mammography, and molecular breast imaging are newer technologies available at some sites. The optimal usage of breast imaging technologies remains controversial, both in screening and diagnostic settings following a new diagnosis of breast cancer. This article reviews well-established and newer, alternative breast imaging technologies as well as recent data regarding their role in optimizing patient care.

### Practice bulletin number 179: Breast cancer risk assessment and screening in average-risk women [^114PTzJb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for breast cancer, specifically with respect to indications for screening average-risk females, ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend obtaining screening mammography every 1 or 2 years. This decision should be based on an informed, shared decision-making process. The process should include a discussion of the benefits and harms of annual and biennial screening, incorporating patient values and preferences in females at average risk of breast cancer.

Consider obtaining biennial screening mammography, particularly after age 55 years, to reduce the frequency of harms, as long as patient counseling includes a discussion that with decreased screening comes some reduction in benefits.

### Screening for breast cancer with mammography [^1173mhBh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

A variety of estimates of the benefits and harms of mammographic screening for breast cancer have been published, and national policies vary.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effect of screening for breast cancer with mammography on mortality and morbidity.

- **Search methods**: We searched PubMed (22 November 2012) and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (22 November 2012).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised trials comparing mammographic screening with no mammographic screening.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently extracted data, and study authors were contacted for additional information.

- **Main results**: Eight eligible trials were identified. We excluded a trial because the randomisation had failed to produce comparable groups. The eligible trials included 600,000 women in the analyses, in the age range of 39 to 74 years. Three trials with adequate randomisation did not show a statistically significant reduction in breast cancer mortality at 13 years (relative risk (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 1.02); four trials with suboptimal randomisation showed a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality with an RR of 0.75 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.83). The RR for all seven trials combined was 0.81 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.87). We found that breast cancer mortality was an unreliable outcome that was biased in favor of screening, mainly because of differential misclassification of cause of death. The trials with adequate randomisation did not find an effect of screening on total cancer mortality, including breast cancer.

### Artificial intelligence system reduces false-positive findings in the interpretation of breast ultrasound exams [^112Q8Nko]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Given the limitations of mammography, ultrasound (US) plays an important role in breast cancer diagnosis. It often serves as a supplementary modality to mammography in screening settings and as the primary imaging modality in many diagnostic settings, including the evaluation of palpable breast abnormalities. Moreover, US can help further evaluate and characterize breast masses and is therefore frequently used for performing image-guided breast biopsies. Breast US has several advantages compared to other imaging modalities, including relatively lower cost, lack of ionizing radiation, and the ability to evaluate images in real time. In particular, US is especially effective at distinguishing solid breast masses from fluid-filled cystic lesions. In addition, breast US is able to detect cancers obscured on mammography, making it particularly useful in diagnosing cancers in women with mammographically dense breast tissue.

Despite these advantages, interpreting breast US is a challenging task. Radiologists evaluate US images using different features, including lesion size, shape, margin, echogenicity, posterior acoustic features, and orientation, which vary significantly across patients. Ultimately, they determine if the imaged findings are benign, need short-term follow-up imaging, or require a biopsy based on their suspicion of malignancy. There is considerable intra-reader variability in these recommendations, and breast US has been criticized for increasing the number of false-positive findings. Compared to mammography alone, the addition of US in breast cancer screening leads to increased detection rates.

### Automated breast ultrasound: Supplemental screening for average-risk women with dense breasts [^113qFhyT]. Clinical Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

We review ultrasound (US) options for supplemental breast cancer screening of average-risk women with dense breasts.

- **Conclusion**: Performance data of physician-performed handheld US (HHUS), technologist-performed HHUS, and automated breast ultrasound (AUS) indicate that all are appropriate for adjunctive screening. Volumetric 3D acquisitions, reduced operator dependence, protocol standardization, reliable comparison with previous studies, independence of performance and interpretation, and whole-breast depiction on coronal view may favor selection of AUS. Important considerations are workflow adjustments for physicians and staff.

### Mammography in combination with breast ultrasonography versus mammography for breast cancer screening in women at average risk [^1134JE64]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Screening mammography can detect breast cancer at an early stage. Supporters of adding ultrasonography to the screening regimen consider it a safe and inexpensive approach to reduce false-negative rates during screening. However, those opposed argue that performing supplemental ultrasonography will also increase the rate of false-positive findings and can lead to unnecessary biopsies and treatments.

- **Objectives**: To assess the comparative effectiveness and safety of mammography in combination with breast ultrasonography versus mammography alone for breast cancer screening for women at average risk of breast cancer.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), and ClinicalTrials.gov up until 3 May 2021.

- **Selection criteria**: For efficacy and harms, we considered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled non-randomized studies enrolling at least 500 women at average risk for breast cancer between the ages of 40 and 75. We also included studies where 80% of the population met our age and breast cancer risk inclusion criteria.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors screened abstracts and full texts, assessed risk of bias, and applied the GRADE approach. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on available event rates. We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis.

- **Main results**: We included eight studies: one RCT, two prospective cohort studies, and five cohort studies.

### Breast cancer screening with mammography [^115cRB7Z]. Current Oncology Reports (2011). Low credibility.

There has been a great deal of controversy regarding the change in breast cancer screening recommendations released by the US Preventive Services Task Force in November 2009. Despite limited new data, the Task Force changed their previous recommendations, delaying initial screening of asymptomatic women from age 40 to age 50 and recommending biennial rather than annual breast cancer screening. It is important to fully understand the nuances of the analysis and modeling upon which the revisions were based in order to accurately inform patients of the risks and benefits of breast cancer screening. Several new studies, as well as additional guidelines, have also been released over the past year, which further inform the debate, and a number of commentaries have helped to place the risks and benefits in clinical and societal context.

### Breast cancer detection using automated whole breast ultrasound and mammography in radiographically dense breasts [^115Td6ms]. European Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Ultrasound is an attractive supplement to mammography because it is widely available, relatively inexpensive, and well-tolerated by patients. It images tissue up to the chest wall in all but the very largest patients and is a cross-sectional technique, displaying tissue without overlap. Early reports using high-resolution ultrasound for breast cancer detection have been promising; however, the time and skill necessary to detect small, non-palpable tumors with hand-held imaging have discouraged widespread use. Berg et al. (ACRIN study) noted that lack of uniformity and a shortage of qualified personnel limit the wide implementation of hand-held imaging.

The automated whole-breast ultrasound (AWBU: Sonocine, Inc. 5475 Reno Corporate Dr. Suite 200, Reno, NV 89511) system gathers standardized uniform image sets by lesser-trained personnel, allowing shorter, more efficient time use by physicians interpreting the studies. Previous studies have shown that 3D AWBU is feasible and has excellent interobserver variability with 2D benign and malignant lesions. The aim of this study was to determine the improvement in diagnostic yield in detecting non-palpable breast cancer in asymptomatic women with 2D AWBU added to mammography.

### Breast cancer screening in women with extremely dense breasts: Recommendations of the European Society of Breast Imaging (EUSOBI) [^1149hSK3]. European Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Several studies have investigated supplemental ultrasound as a technique to improve the performance of population-based screening in women with extremely dense breasts. On average, cancer detection increases by 2.3/1000 screens with ultrasound. The added detection with ultrasound is also present when digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) screening is performed and persists in follow-up rounds. Unfortunately, the number of false-positive examinations strongly increases with ultrasound. Reported positive predictive values for biopsy vary widely but are commonly below 10% for findings only observed at ultrasound and remain relatively low, even as specificity increases in follow-up rounds.

In a large prospective Japanese study conducted in women aged 40–49 years, it was shown that program sensitivity improved from 77% to 91% with the addition of an ultrasound examination. Moreover, they showed that the frequency of interval cancer was reduced by 50%. Nevertheless, it is not clear whether these findings can be considered a valid reference for European screening programs, where screening focuses on women aged 50–69, where the incidence of breast cancer is much higher and where women tend to have larger, more heterogeneous breasts; the results do provide initial evidence to suggest that, for some women, ultrasound may be beneficial.

Within Europe, supplemental ultrasound has been structurally implemented in Austria for women with dense breasts (BI-RADS classes c and d). In the timeframe from 2014 to 2017, the program showed a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 99%. The breast cancer detection rate was similar.

### Clinical experience on the limited role of ultrasound for breast cancer screening in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations carriers aged 30–39 years [^1152NzTc]. Clinical Imaging (2024). High credibility.

In BRCA germline pathogenic sequence variants (PSV) carriers aged 30–39 years, imaging is recommended at six-month intervals. The European Society for Medical Oncology recommends the use of six-monthly MRI screening, which is being considered at our institution, particularly for younger carriers under the age of 35, although it is not mandatory. If six-monthly MRI is unavailable, annual MRI may be supplemented by ultrasound (with or without mammography). The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of ultrasound screening added to mammography as a six-month supplement to annual MRI in BRCA PSV carriers aged 30–39 years.

This IRB-approved retrospective study included BRCA PSV carriers aged 30–39 years who underwent breast cancer screening at our institution between January 2015 and March 2023. Participants were divided into two groups: those who had supplemental whole-breast ultrasound and mammography at six months and underwent screening before March 2019, and those who had only mammography without supplemental ultrasound and enrolled in screening after March 2019. Patient characteristics, cancer detection rates, and cancer characteristics were compared between the two groups.

Overall, 200 asymptomatic BRCA1/2 PSV carriers undergoing screening at our institution were included in the study. The mean age was 35.7 ± 3.5 years, and the mean follow-up time was 37.4 ± 38.0 months. There were 118 (59%) women screened with supplemental ultrasound and 82 (41%) women without. Eight cancers were diagnosed during the study period, four in women with supplemental ultrasound.

### Mammography screening preferences among screening-eligible women in their 40s: A national U.S. survey [^113npP78]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently changed its recommendation for mammography screening from informed decision-making to biennial screening for women aged 40 to 49 years. Although many women welcome this change, some may prefer not to be screened at age 40 years.

- **Objective**: To conduct a national probability-based U.S. survey to investigate breast cancer screening preferences among women aged 39 to 49 years.

- **Design**: Pre-post survey with a breast cancer screening decision aid (DA) intervention (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05376241).

- **Setting**: Online national U.S. survey.

- **Participants**: 495 women aged 39 to 49 years without a history of breast cancer or a known BRCA1/2 gene mutation.

- **Intervention**: A mammography screening DA providing information about screening benefits and harms and a personalized breast cancer risk estimate.

- **Measurements**: Screening preferences (assessed before and after the DA), 10-year Gail model risk estimate, and whether the information was surprising and different from past messages.

- **Results**: Before viewing the DA, 27.0% of participants preferred to delay screening (versus having mammography at their age), compared with 38.5% after the DA. There was no increase in the number never wanting mammography (5.4% before the DA versus 4.3% after the DA). Participants who preferred to delay screening had lower breast cancer risk than those who preferred not to delay. The information about overdiagnosis was surprising for 37.4% of participants compared to 27.2% and 22.9% for information about false-positive results and screening benefits, respectively.

### The paradox of MRI for breast cancer screening: high-risk and dense breasts-available evidence and current practice [^113Z3CDB]. Insights into Imaging (2024). High credibility.

The conceptual EBM framework of screening tests guides the adoption of screening tests by considering historical examples, such as screening mammography. In 1998, the UK National Screening Committee defined screening as the systematic application of a test to identify apparently healthy individuals at increased risk of a specific disorder, to offer information, further investigation, or treatment as appropriate. Recently, the World Health Organization emphasized that a specific target population is invited from central records to perform simple tests to detect individuals with a disease who do not yet exhibit symptoms.

Furthermore, screening programs should be implemented only after establishing their effectiveness, ensuring adequate resources, having facilities for diagnosis, as well as for treatment and follow-up, and when the prevalence of the disease justifies the costs associated with screening. Screening efforts should be justified by the considerable advantages they offer, such as disease secondary prevention and reduction in disability/mortality, which significantly outweigh any potential negative consequences. This document clearly distinguishes between "screening" as applied to apparently healthy individuals and "early diagnosis" as applied to individuals with signs or symptoms (the "clinical" or "diagnostic" context).

In fact, screening addresses disorders that, while occurring with varying frequencies in individuals' lives, remain consistently uncom.

### Will supplemental screening ultrasound increase breast cancer overdiagnosis [^113hs1WJ]. Academic Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Overdiagnosis refers to the detection of cancers that would never come to light in a patient's lifetime and are only identified by means of screening. Exactly how much overdiagnosis currently exists with screening mammography is uncertain. Because we do not know for certain which tumors would ultimately lead to death if left untreated and which would not, we cannot directly measure overdiagnosis and how best to estimate it is a matter of controversy. A conservative estimate of overdiagnosis with mammography would be on the order of 10%, but estimates have ranged as high as 54%.

We know from multiple studies that ultrasound (US) screening mostly detects small, invasive, node-negative cancers; and in the ACRIN 6666 study, there was a greater tendency for US-only-detected tumors to be low grade than those detected with mammography. However, the population of patients undergoing screening US can be expected to differ from the average screening mammography population in that they will have higher breast density, they will be younger, and they may also have higher breast cancer risk than the population undergoing screening mammography. These factors may be associated with more aggressive tumors.

There is no way to know whether we will be increasing overdiagnosis without performing a large randomized controlled study with very long-term follow-up. Even if some cancers are overdiagnosed with US, there will be a greater proportion of lethal breast cancers that are successfully treated because of screening US. The more important task is to learn how to correctly diagnose and appropriately manage cases detected through supplemental US screening.

### The changing world of breast cancer: A radiologist's perspective [^115hfQm3]. Investigative Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Contemporary breast ultrasound is illustrated in Figure 1. A high-resolution (15 MHz) 2D ultrasound of a 55-year-old patient was conducted for ultrasound screening due to intermediately dense breasts. The screening ultrasound revealed a subtle isoechoic mass. Shear wave elastography suggested the presence of infiltrating cancer. A biopsy confirmed a small, 4-mm invasive ductal cancer (pT1a, N0, M0). For a 56-year-old patient undergoing screening, a hypoechoic mass was identified at 2D ultrasound, exhibiting a suspicious growth pattern that appeared benign on 3D ultrasound. An ultrasound-guided core biopsy of the lesion revealed a sclerotic fibroadenoma.

Breast MRI advancements began in the late 1980s, with the first contrast-enhanced MRI study conducted in Germany in 1986 after the invention of the MR contrast agent, gadolinium-DTPA, by a German company. The subsequent technical approaches to breast MRI in Europe and the United States diverged, driven primarily by the technical limitations of the MR systems from manufacturers in each region. European vendors offered breast surface coils that covered both breasts, whereas US vendors provided single-breast coils only. Kaiser and Zeitler were pioneers in describing that breast cancers not only enhance but also exhibit fast enhancement, demonstrating that fast imaging aids in both detection and differential diagnosis. Utilizing European equipment, Kaiser developed fast bilateral breast MRI, which at the time required a compromise on spatial resolution.

### Breast ultrasound: Recommendations for information to women and referring physicians by the European Society of Breast Imaging [^116BeaC3]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Clear instructions and explanations regarding the entire procedure should be provided to the woman. The optimal protocol for performing breast ultrasound (US) requires the patient to lie in the supine position with the chest undressed and with arms flexed behind the head to flatten the breast or in the oblique position for scanning the lateral part of the breast and, when needed, the axilla. Breast US can even be performed in women who cannot lie down or flex the arms behind the head, although in these conditions it becomes more difficult to perform the examination and the results might be suboptimal.

A clinical US scanner with dedicated linear probes working from 10 to 15–18 MHz for the superficial details or small breasts, and from 4 to 8 MHz for deeper areas or very large breasts, should be employed. A contact gel is always applied to the breast to allow the US waves to be transmitted from the probe to the breast tissues. The probe is placed on the breast and moved in multiple directions, with gentle pressure that makes US usually painless and well tolerated.

Importantly, for many indications, breast US is aimed at evaluating specific clinical findings or findings detected through other imaging modalities. In many cases, only a unilateral, targeted breast US examination is performed and not a bilateral whole breast US. Thus, whether both breasts, only one breast, or just a part of one breast will be scanned depends on the indication, mammographic breast density, and local policies. The axilla will be scanned in women with clinical or radiological findings.

### Digital mammography screening: How many breast cancers are additionally detected by bilateral ultrasound examination during assessment [^114PCL22]. European Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the positive predictive values of incremental breast cancer detection (PPV1) in relation to mammographic breast density and of performed biopsies (PPV3) resulting from supplemental bilateral physician-performed whole-breast ultrasound (US) at recall of a population-based digital mammography screening program.

A total of 2,803 recalled screening participants (ages 50–69), who underwent additional bilateral US with prospectively completed documentation (grading of breast density ACR 1–4, biopsy recommendations related to US and mammography), were included.

The results showed that the PPV1 of supplemental cancer detection only by US was 0.21% (6/2,803) compared to 13.8% (386/2,803) by mammography. The PPV1 for US-only cancer detection was 0%, 0.16% (2/1,220), 0.22% (3/1,374), and 1.06% (1/94) for women with breast density of ACR 1, ACR 2, ACR 3, and ACR 4, respectively. The PPV3 of US-only lesion detection was 33.3% (9/27) compared to 38.0% (405/1,066) by mammography. The proportion of invasive cancers no larger than 10 mm was 37.5% (3/8) for US-only detection compared to 38.4% (113/294) for mammographic detection.

In conclusion, bilateral ultrasound at recall, in addition to the assessment of screen-detected mammographic abnormalities, resulted in a low PPV of incremental cancer detection only by US, without a disproportional increase of false-positive biopsies.

### Prevalent vs incident screen: Why does it matter [^116BhnAw]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

There are important differences in the performance and outcomes of breast cancer screening between the prevalent and incident screening rounds. The prevalent screen is the first screening examination using a particular imaging technique; it identifies pre-existing, undiagnosed cancers in the population. The incident screen refers to any subsequent screening examination using the same technique. It is expected to identify fewer cancers than the prevalent screen because it captures only those cancers that have become detectable since the prior screening examination. The higher cancer detection rate at prevalent screening relative to incident screening should be considered when analyzing the medical audit and effectiveness of new screening technologies.

### Screening for breast cancer: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^115UzpQV]. JAMA (2024). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for ductal carcinoma in situ, specifically in breast cancer screening for average-risk females, the USPSTF 2024 guidelines recommend that there is insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of supplemental screening for breast cancer using breast ultrasound or MRI in females identified to have dense breasts on an otherwise negative screening mammogram.

### Beyond mammography: New frontiers in breast cancer screening [^115pxGWt]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Breast cancer screening remains a subject of intense and, at times, passionate debate. Mammography has long been the mainstay of breast cancer detection and is the only screening test proven to reduce mortality. Although it remains the gold standard of breast cancer screening, there is increasing awareness of subpopulations of women for whom mammography has reduced sensitivity. Mammography has also undergone increased scrutiny for false positives and excessive biopsies, which increase radiation dose, cost, and patient anxiety.

In response to these challenges, new technologies for breast cancer screening have been developed, including low-dose mammography, contrast-enhanced mammography, tomosynthesis, automated whole breast ultrasound, molecular imaging, and magnetic resonance imaging. Here, we examine some of the controversies and promising new technologies that may improve the detection of breast cancer both in the general population and in high-risk groups, such as women with dense breasts. We propose that optimal breast cancer screening will ultimately require a personalized approach based on metrics of cancer risk, with selective application of specific screening technologies best suited to the individual's age, risk, and breast density.

### Breast cancer screening in women with dense breasts: Current status and future directions for appropriate risk stratification and imaging utilization [^111YkqDJ]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

Breast density continues to be a prevailing topic in the field of breast imaging, contributing to overall confusion and controversy among patients and the medical community. In this article, we explore the status of breast cancer screening in women with dense breasts, including breast density legislation. Risk-based approaches to supplemental screening may be more financially cost-effective. While all advanced imaging modalities detect additional primarily invasive, node-negative cancers, the degree to which this occurs can vary by density category. Future directions include expanding the use of density-inclusive risk models with appropriate risk stratification and imaging utilization. Further research is needed, however, to better understand how to optimize population-based screening programs with knowledge of patients' individualized risk, including breast density assessment, to improve the benefit-to-harm ratio of breast cancer screening.

### Practice bulletin number 179: Breast cancer risk assessment and screening in average-risk women [^114mMcvf]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for ductal carcinoma in situ, specifically in the context of breast cancer screening, the ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend offering screening mammography starting at age 40 for females at average risk of breast cancer. It is advised not to start screening mammography earlier than age 40 for these individuals. For women who have not started screening in their 40s, it is recommended to begin no later than age 50. The decision about the appropriate age to start mammography screening should be made through a shared decision-making process, which takes into account the potential benefits and harms.

### Screening ultrasound as an adjunct to mammography in women with mammographically dense breasts [^113go1Zn]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

There are potential benefits and harms of screening ultrasound (US) to supplement mammographic screening of women with dense breast tissue. We conducted a comprehensive literature review of studies assessing the efficacy of screening US to supplement mammography among women with dense breasts. From a total of 189 peer-reviewed publications on the performance of screening US, 12 studies were relevant to our analysis. The reporting of breast cancer risk factors varied across studies; however, the study populations tended to be at greater than average risk for developing breast cancer.

Overall, US detected an additional 0.3–7.7 cancers per 1000 examinations (median, 4.2) and was associated with an additional 11.7–106.6 biopsies per 1000 examinations (median, 52.2). Significant improvements in cancer detection in dense breasts have been achieved with the transition from film to digital mammography. Thus, adjunctive screening with ultrasound should be considered in the context of screening mammography performance. Clinicians should discuss breast density as one of several important breast cancer risk factors, consider the potential harms of adjunctive screening, and arrive at a shared decision consistent with each woman's preferences and values.

### Combined screening with ultrasound and mammography vs mammography alone in women at elevated risk of breast cancer [^116mX28b]. JAMA (2008). Low credibility.

Screening ultrasound may depict small, node-negative breast cancers not seen on mammography.

- **Objective**: To compare the diagnostic yield, defined as the proportion of women with positive screen test results and positive reference standard, and performance of screening with ultrasound plus mammography vs. mammography alone in women at elevated risk of breast cancer.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: From April 2004 to February 2006, 2809 women with at least heterogeneously dense breast tissue in at least one quadrant were recruited from 21 sites. They underwent mammographic and physician-performed ultrasonographic examinations in randomized order by a radiologist masked to the other examination results. The reference standard was defined as a combination of pathology and 12-month follow-up and was available for 2637 (96.8%) of the 2725 eligible participants.

- **Main outcome measures**: Diagnostic yield, sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy (assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) of combined mammography plus ultrasound vs. mammography alone and the positive predictive value of biopsy recommendations for mammography plus ultrasound vs. mammography alone.

- **Results**: Forty participants (41 breasts) were diagnosed with cancer. Eight were suspicious on both ultrasound and mammography, 12 on ultrasound alone, 12 on mammography alone, and eight participants (nine breasts) on neither. The diagnostic yield for mammography was 7.6 per 1000 women screened (20 of 2637) and increased to 11.8 per 1000 (31 of 2637) for combined mammography plus ultrasound.

Screening tests are generally not recommended for patients with advanced cancer and limited life expectancy. Nonetheless, screening mammography still occurs and may lead to follow-up testing. We assessed the frequency of downstream breast imaging following screening mammography in patients with advanced colorectal or lung cancer.

Population-based study: The study included continuously enrolled female fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or older with advanced colorectal (stage IV) or lung (stage IIIB-IV) cancer reported to a Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry between 2000 and 2011.

Main measures: We assessed the utilization of diagnostic mammography, breast ultrasound, and breast MRI following screening mammography. Logistic regression models were used to explore independent predictors of utilization of downstream tests while controlling for cancer type and patient sociodemographic and regional characteristics.

Key results: Among 34,127 women with advanced cancer (23% colorectal, 77% lung cancer; mean age at diagnosis 75 years), 9% (n = 3159) underwent a total of 5750 screening mammograms. Of these, 11% (n = 639) resulted in at least one subsequent diagnostic breast imaging examination within 9 months. Diagnostic mammography was most common (9%; n = 532), followed by ultrasound (6%; n = 334) and MRI (0.2%; n = 14). Diagnostic mammography rates were higher in whites than African Americans (OR, 1.6; p < 0.05). Higher ultrasound utilization was associated with more favorable economic status.

### ACR Appropriateness criteria breast cancer screening [^116thJpK]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Mammography is the recommended method for breast cancer screening of women in the general population. However, mammography alone does not perform as well as mammography plus supplemental screening in high-risk women. Therefore, supplemental screening with MRI or ultrasound is recommended in selected high-risk populations. Screening breast MRI is recommended for women at high risk for breast cancer on the basis of family history or genetic predisposition. Ultrasound is an option for those high-risk women who cannot undergo MRI. Recent literature also supports the use of breast MRI in some women of intermediate risk, and ultrasound may be an option for intermediate-risk women with dense breasts.

There is insufficient evidence to support the use of other imaging modalities such as thermography, breast-specific gamma imaging, positron emission mammography, and optical imaging for breast cancer screening. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every two years by a multidisciplinary expert panel.

The guideline development and review includes an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances where evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### The paradox of MRI for breast cancer screening: High-risk and dense breasts-available evidence and current practice [^115Cc2XK]. Insights into Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

A recent systematic review and meta-analysis, including 22 studies, reported that out of 132,166 screened women with dense breasts and negative mammography, a total of 541 cancers missed at mammography were detected with supplemental modalities, including DBT, handheld or automated breast ultrasound, and MRI. MRI was significantly superior to the other modalities in cancer detection rate (1.52 per 1000 screenings), including invasive cancers (1.31 per 1000 screenings) and DCIS (1.91 per 1000 screenings), without significant differences in recall or biopsy rate. The authors highlight that the limited number of studies prevented assessment of interval cancer rates. Excluding MRI, no significant difference in any metrics was identified among the remaining modalities.

The integration of breast MRI for screening women with dense breasts into practice, despite its reported potential benefits (supported by comparative studies and substantiated by an RCT), has encountered several challenges. A prominent obstacle is the considerable cost associated with MRI screening, which includes not only the imaging itself but also the specialized equipment and personnel required. A further practical problem is the request for more additional tests. These implications can place significant strains on healthcare systems, hampering their capacity to extend routine MRI screenings to a broader population beyond the subgroup of high-risk women. Presently, ultrasonography is a more common choice for supplemental screening, thanks to its broader availability and lower implementation costs.

### A review of supplemental screening ultrasound for breast cancer: Certain populations of women with dense breast tissue may benefit [^1141ru53]. Academic Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Breast density has been shown to be a strong, independent risk factor for breast cancer. Unfortunately, mammography is less accurate on dense breast tissue compared to fattier breast tissue. Multiple studies suggest a solution to this by demonstrating the ability of supplemental screening ultrasound to detect additional malignant lesions in women with dense breast tissue but negative mammography.

In particular, supplemental screening ultrasound may be beneficial to:

- **Women with dense breast tissue**: Specifically, those with intermediate or average risk for breast cancer.
- **Specific ethnic populations**: Women in these groups may have a greater prevalence of dense breast tissue.
- **Resource-poor healthcare environments**: Women living here may benefit from supplemental screening ultrasound.

Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently recommended for women at high risk for breast cancer, not all women can access or tolerate an MRI examination. Notably, ultrasound does not require intravenous gadolinium and may be an alternative for women with socioeconomic or medical restrictions, which limit their access to MRI.

Limitations of supplemental screening ultrasound include:

- **False-positives**: There is a substantial rate of these in screening results.
- **Increased cost**: Financial considerations may impact its widespread use.
- **Limited resource availability**: Particularly in the time required for image interpretation.

Additional clinical experience with this application of ultrasound, improved patient selection criteria, and new technology, such as the promising results seen with automated whole breast ultrasound, may address these limitations. In light of recent legislation in some states that has called for discussion of these issues, further exploration and evidence-based guidelines are necessary.

### Can mammographic assessments lead to consider density as a risk factor for breast cancer [^113Au5hm]. European Journal of Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Admitting that mammographic breast density is an important independent risk factor for breast cancer in the general population has a crucial economic healthcare impact since it might lead to increasing screening frequency or reinforcing additional modalities. Thus, the impact of density as a risk factor has to be carefully investigated and might be debated. Some authors suggested that high density would be either a weak factor or confused with a masking effect. Others concluded that most of the studies have methodological biases in basic physics to quantify the percentage of breast density, as well as in mammographic acquisition parameters.

The purpose of this review is to evaluate mammographic procedures and density assessments in published studies regarding density as a breast cancer risk. No standardization was found in breast density assessments and compared density categories. High-density definitions varied widely from 25 to 75% of dense tissues on mammograms. Some studies showed an insufficient follow-up to reveal the masking effect related to mammographic false negatives. Evaluating breast density impact needs thorough studies with consensual mammographic procedures, methods of density measurement, breast density classification, as well as a standardized definition of high breast density. Digital mammography, more effective in dense breasts, should help to re-evaluate the issue of density as a risk factor for breast cancer.

### Screening for breast cancer: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112fHv1Z]. JAMA (2024). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for ductal carcinoma in situ, specifically in the context of breast cancer screening for average-risk females, the USPSTF 2024 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography in females aged ≥ 75 years.

### The paradox of MRI for breast cancer screening: High-risk and dense breasts-available evidence and current practice [^1159kdmj]. Insights into Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

In this scenario, the most updated guidelines from the European Commission Initiative on Breast Cancer (ECIBC) propose the following suggestions regarding asymptomatic women with high breast density aged 45−74 years in the context of an organized population-based screening program:

- **MRI screening**: Not implement tailored MRI screening following a negative mammogram [issued in January 2020].
- **DBT screening**: If high mammographic breast density is detected for the first time with digital mammography, implement tailored screening with DBT in the next screening round [issued in September 2021].

The update on MRI screening was undertaken a few months after the publication of the DENSE trial results and before the publication of the ECOG-ACRIN EA1141 study as well as analyses and models about cost-effectiveness and possible prolonged intervals between MRIs. Of note, the ECIBC Guidelines Development Group defined this recommendation as "conditional" and with a "very low certainty of the evidence". Additionally, almost four years after issuing the guideline, the proposed research priorities — balance of effects including the potential risk of adverse events due to contrast reaction, improving the specificity of MRI-tailored screening, and studying abbreviated protocols to make the intervention less costly and more acceptable — can be considered substantially solved. Nowadays, the recommendation in favor of DBT, which applies to women with both density c or d, appears to take into consideration more practical feasibility than the evidence available. It remains to see what the next ECIBC guidelines update will propose.

### An overview of the status of imaging screening technology for breast cancer [^115PKrQv]. Annals of Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

With breast cancer incidence rates showing no signs of abating, advances in risk stratification and increasing awareness of cancer control, there is interest in expanding the breast imaging arsenal. Mammography is still the standard of care, and a recent meta-analysis of seven large studies supports its value as a screening tool. There is, however, a clear need for improved sensitivity and specificity. Imaging of function, metabolism, and molecular activity in breast tissue is of potential benefit in addressing these issues.

In this article, we provide an overview of the methods of imaging in breast cancer, including mammography, ultrasound, digital mammography, magnetic resonance, positron emission tomography, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Screening and surveillance should, ideally, be tailored to an individual's cancer risk and breast tissue. Evidence questions the recent move toward magnetic resonance imaging as a single or multimodality strategy for breast cancer screening. In a high-risk group, the cost-effectiveness of technical innovations may be justified.

### Breast ultrasound: Recommendations for information to women and referring physicians by the European Society of Breast Imaging [^112TmdKV]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Indications for breast ultrasound: Definite, possible, and inappropriate indications for breast ultrasound are listed in Tables 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In the following paragraphs, we will enter into the details for those indications being most clinically relevant or debated.

- **Screening**: In high-risk women who cannot undergo screening with MRI, ultrasound is indicated in very young women under about 30–35 years of age and as an adjunct to mammography in older women. Notably, in BRCA mutation carriers, evidence of higher sensitivity to radiation exposure of the breast tissue suggests avoiding mammography, at least at a young age.

In women at average or intermediate risk with dense breasts, supplemental screening with either handheld or automated bilateral breast ultrasound can be performed following a negative mammogram to increase cancer detection, albeit at the price of a high false positive recall rate. Additionally, invasive cancers detected by ultrasound, which tend to be small and node-negative, are thus more likely to be treated with curative intent. Considering that interval cancers are those diagnosed in the time interval between two scheduled screening examinations, the addition of ultrasound screening to mammography in women with dense breasts has been shown in one study to reduce the interval cancer rate to a level similar to that observed in women with non-dense breasts screened with mammography only. These results support implementation.

### Practice bulletin number 179: Breast cancer risk assessment and screening in average-risk women [^11263qBB]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for breast cancer, specifically with respect to indications for screening in average-risk females, the ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend offering screening mammography starting at age 40 years in females at average risk of breast cancer. Screening mammography should be offered no earlier than age 40 years in this group. For those who have not initiated screening in their 40s, screening mammography should begin by no later than age 50 years. The decision about the age to begin mammography screening should be made through a shared decision-making process, taking into account information about the potential benefits and harms.

### 2d mammography, digital breast tomosynthesis, and ultrasound: Which should be used for the different breast densities in breast cancer screening [^115qPLi9]. Clinical imaging (2015). Low credibility.

To determine which modalities — 2D mammography (2D), digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), or whole breast sonography (WBS) — are optimal for screening depending on breast density, an institutional retrospective cohort study was conducted. It analyzed 16,789 screening mammograms from 2013, sorted by modalities and density.

Cancer detection increased by adding WBS to 2D for the overall study population (P = 0.02). The recall rate was lowest with the combination of 2D and DBT (10.2%, p < 0.001) but highest when WBS was added to 2D and DBT (23.6%, p < 0.001).

Women with both dense and nondense breasts benefit from a reduced recall rate with the addition of DBT; however, this benefit is negated when WBS is also added.

### Mammography in combination with breast ultrasonography versus mammography for breast cancer screening in women at average risk [^116KW2n6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is the most common malignant disease diagnosed in women worldwide. Screening with mammography is capable of detecting breast cancer at an early stage. The diagnostic accuracy of mammography screening largely depends on the radiographic density of the imaged breasts. In radiographically dense breasts, non-calcified breast cancers are more likely to be missed than in fatty breasts, which consequently leads to some cancers not being detected by mammography screening. Supporters of adjunct ultrasonography to the screening regimen for breast cancer argue that it might be a safe and inexpensive approach to reduce the false-negative rates of the screening process. Critics, however, are concerned that performing supplemental ultrasonography on women at average risk will also increase the rate of false-positive findings and can lead to unnecessary biopsies and treatments.

- **Objectives**: To assess the comparative effectiveness and safety of mammography in combination with breast ultrasonography versus mammography for breast cancer screening for women at average risk of breast cancer.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (via OvidSP), and EMBASE up until February 2012. To detect ongoing or unpublished studies, we searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP).

### The appropriateness of employing imaging screening technologies: Report of the methods committee of the ACR task force on screening technologies [^112F368f]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Screening for disease using imaging technologies is a growing phenomenon. For some applications, such as mammography in breast cancer, there is solid evidence that imaging screening reduces disease-specific mortality. However, for other applications, public interest in imaging screening is progressing despite a lack of valid scientific evidence that such screening improves public health. Clinical trials promise to eventually shed light on the value of imaging screening, but the results will not be known for several years. In the meantime, physicians and the public need guidance on whether specific imaging screening examinations are appropriate.

The ACR charged the Methods Committee of its Task Force on Screening Technologies to advise the organization on how it could best use available evidence to make public recommendations on imaging screening technologies. This article is the outcome of the committee's deliberations, including recommendations for the method of arriving at a recommendation, the approach to dissemination, and the intended audience for the recommendations.

### Screening for breast cancer with mammography [^113b1bfi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

A variety of estimates of the benefits and harms of mammographic screening for breast cancer have been published, and national policies vary.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effect of screening for breast cancer with mammography on mortality and morbidity.

- **Search strategy**: We searched PubMed as of November 2008.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised trials comparing mammographic screening with no mammographic screening.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Both authors independently extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information.

- **Main results**: Eight eligible trials were identified. We excluded a biased trial and included 600,000 women in the analyses. Three trials with adequate randomisation did not show a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality at 13 years (relative risk (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 1.02); four trials with suboptimal randomisation showed a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality with an RR of 0.75 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.83). The RR for all seven trials combined was 0.81 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.87).

We found that breast cancer mortality was an unreliable outcome that was biased in favour of screening, mainly because of differential misclassification of cause of death. The trials with adequate randomisation found no effect of screening on cancer mortality, including breast cancer, after 10 years (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.10) or on all-cause mortality after 13 years (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.03). Numbers of lumpectomies and mastectomies were significantly larger in the screened groups (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.42).

### Mammographic screening: Evidence from randomised controlled trials [^114GXsdg]. Annals of Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

All randomised breast cancer screening trials have shown a reduction in breast cancer mortality in the 'invited for mammography' screening arm compared with the 'control arm' for women aged 50 years and older at randomisation, with an overall reduction of 25%. However, individually published point estimates differ, and concerns have been raised about methodological quality and outcome measures.

- **Materials and methods**: Review of the evidence on breast cancer mortality reduction and discussion of the causes of difference in point estimates in the five Swedish and Canadian trials. A summary of the prerequisites for methodological quality and its available evidence from the trials is provided. Data supporting the use of breast cancer mortality as a correct outcome measure are presented.

- **Results**: There is no reason not to use breast cancer mortality as an outcome measure for trials intended to reduce breast cancer mortality, both from a clinical and methodological point of view. Every effort was made in these trials to determine this outcome measure as accurately as possible. Variations in breast cancer mortality reduction rates among the trials are not critical if one considers the background situation in the region before the trial started, the design of the trial, or the quality of screening.

- **Conclusions**: There seems to be no reason to change or halt the nationwide population-based screening programmes. Nor is there any justifiable reason for negative reports towards women or professionals.
