## Question

Does exercise built bone in osteoporosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether exercise builds bone in osteoporosis, and if so, how much and under what conditions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between building bone mass versus maintaining or slowing loss. Then, I should verify the biological mechanisms by which mechanical loading affects bone. Next, I will review the magnitude of BMD effects in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, followed by effects on bone structure and strength. After that, I need to check whether exercise reduces fractures and how falls risk modifies that signal. I will then consider age-related differences in responsiveness, including pediatric gains and adult maintenance. Finally, I should confirm safety, especially in vertebral fracture, and synthesize practical, guideline-concordant recommendations with appropriate caveats and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: in established osteoporosis, the realistic question is not whether exercise can "reverse" osteoporosis but whether it can slow bone loss, modestly increase BMD, improve bone quality and structure, reduce falls, and thereby lower fracture risk, recognizing that pharmacotherapy remains foundational for high-risk patients [^113i2mbr] [^115Wgg4G] [^113d5URw].

> I will now examine the biological rationale. Mechanical loading activates osteocyte signaling, downregulates sclerostin, and favors osteoblast activity, with dynamic, cyclic, high-magnitude, and odd-impact loads producing the strongest osteogenic stimulus. This mechanobiology supports the plausibility that appropriately dosed resistance and impact training can benefit bone even in older adults, albeit less than in youth [^114gyq3b] [^114ydpa3] [^116eKotf].

> Next, I should review the magnitude of BMD effects in postmenopausal women. Meta-analyses show small but statistically significant BMD gains at the lumbar spine and femoral neck with resistance and combined programs, typically on the order of about 1–3% over 6–12 months, with the most consistent signal for progressive resistance training and combination programs that include impact. For example, the Cochrane review found lumbar spine gains of about 3% with combination programs and femoral neck gains of about 1% with resistance training, and a 2017 meta-analysis of combined interventions showed modest improvements at spine, hip, and total body BMD, with larger effects in younger postmenopausal cohorts [^115FuhmL] [^116XK8Gt] [^11468qNu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "building bone" equaling stronger bones. I need to check whether these BMD changes translate into improved bone structure and strength. Evidence using pQCT and related imaging shows that impact and resistance training can produce site-specific improvements in cortical thickness and estimates of bone strength, particularly at loaded regions like the proximal femur and distal tibia, though effects are modest and not universal across all sites; importantly, even small structural gains can improve biomechanical strength independent of BMD, which helps explain clinical benefit despite seemingly small percentage changes [^114FtkYe] [^117UsSKM] [^1179zS7V].

> I should confirm whether exercise reduces fractures, because that is the key clinical endpoint. There are no adequately powered RCTs of exercise with fracture as a primary outcome in postmenopausal women, but observational data consistently associate higher physical activity with 10–40% lower hip and all-fracture risk, and exercise trials demonstrate substantial reductions in injurious falls and fall-related injuries; taken together, it is reasonable to infer that exercise lowers fracture risk primarily via improved balance, strength, and possibly modest improvements in bone quality, even if the direct fracture evidence is indirect [^113i2mbr] [^113m9q7R].

> Let me consider age-related responsiveness, because this shapes expectations. In children and adolescents, especially prepubertally, weight-bearing and impact exercise yields larger, clinically meaningful gains in bone mineral content and strength, on the order of roughly 1–8% annually at loaded sites, with sex- and maturity-related differences. In contrast, adults, particularly postmenopausal women, generally experience maintenance or small BMD gains rather than large accrual, reinforcing that the main benefit in osteoporosis is slowing loss and improving structure and falls risk rather than "rebuilding" bone mass [^1153FsSU] [^116TReZy] [^116qERAC].

> Wait, let me verify safety, especially for those with vertebral fractures or high fracture risk. High-quality consensus guidance emphasizes that exercise is safe for most people with osteoporosis when appropriately progressed and supervised. Harms are uncommon, and vertebral fractures attributable to exercise are rare in trials, though loaded spinal flexion should be avoided and those with existing vertebral fractures should generally limit impact to brisk-walking equivalents while prioritizing strength, balance, and postural extension exercises. Importantly, inactivity confers greater risk than appropriately dosed loading [^1115z18n] [^117XgWw2] [^114J6wa6].

> I need to ensure the exercise prescription aligns with evidence and guidelines. The most consistent benefits arise from progressive resistance training targeting major muscle groups and sites at risk (hip, spine, forearm) at 8–12 repetition maximum intensity for 2–3 sets, 2–3 times per week, combined with impact activities such as jumping, hopping, or stomping totaling about 50 moderate impacts on most days, interspersed with rest. Balance and functional strength training should be layered in to reduce falls, and programs should be individualized and supervised, especially in frailty or after vertebral fracture [^115LM1DL] [^117LP97G] [^115Wgg4G].

> But wait, what if the patient cannot tolerate impact or has multiple vertebral fractures? In that case, I should confirm that resistance training alone still confers benefit and that impact can be titrated to tolerance, with explicit avoidance of end-range spinal flexion under load. Even without high-impact elements, strengthening and balance training improve function and likely reduce falls, which meaningfully alters fracture risk, and emerging data suggest structured, brief, low-impact osteogenic loading may help in select settings, though higher-quality trials are needed [^117XgWw2] [^116JrQQh].

> I should double-check the role of adherence and progression, because dose and consistency matter. Trials repeatedly show that benefits track with compliance and progressive overload; in fact, per-protocol analyses and longer-term studies demonstrate larger effects with sustained participation, and a 16-year supervised program showed accumulating BMD advantages over time, underscoring that maintenance and progression are key to realizing clinically relevant gains [^114QHKLX] [^112h1NEG].

> Let me reconsider the initial premise and synthesize. Exercise does not typically "build" large amounts of new bone in established osteoporosis, but it can slow or modestly reverse age-related bone loss, improve bone structure at loaded sites, and substantially reduce falls and injurious falls, thereby lowering fracture risk. In children and adolescents, exercise can truly build bone and increase peak bone mass, which has lifelong protective value, so expectations should be age- and context-specific and paired with pharmacotherapy when fracture risk is high [^113i2mbr] [^115Wgg4G] [^1153FsSU].

> Final answer: Yes, exercise can modestly increase BMD and improve bone structure in osteoporosis, but the dominant clinical benefit is maintenance or small gains in bone mass, improved bone quality, and large reductions in falls and injurious falls, which together reduce fracture risk. Effects are greatest with progressive resistance plus impact training, adherence is essential, and exercise should be individualized and supervised, especially after vertebral fracture, with avoidance of loaded spinal flexion and careful progression of intensity [^115FuhmL] [^113i2mbr] [^117XgWw2].

Exercise **builds bone in osteoporosis** by stimulating new bone formation and slowing bone loss, especially when programs combine progressive resistance training with impact activities [^113i2mbr] [^116eKotf]. In postmenopausal women, exercise increases spine and hip BMD by 1–3% over 6–12 months [^115FuhmL] [^116XK8Gt], and in older adults it improves bone structure and strength at loaded sites [^114FtkYe] [^112YyT1F]. Benefits are **site-specific and dose-dependent** [^116eKotf]; high-intensity, progressive resistance and impact training yield the largest gains, while balance and posture exercises reduce falls and fracture risk [^113m9q7R] [^117XgWw2]. Exercise is safe and recommended for most patients with osteoporosis, but those with vertebral fractures should avoid loaded spinal flexion and use supervised, individualized programs [^113dcCX8] [^117XgWw2].

## Mechanisms of exercise-induced bone formation

Exercise promotes bone formation through **mechanical loading**, which activates osteocytes and downstream signaling that increases osteoblast activity and new bone formation [^114gyq3b]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Mechanotransduction**: Physical loading converts mechanical signals into biochemical responses, increasing osteoblast activity and bone formation [^114ydpa3].

- **Wnt/β-catenin signaling**: Loading downregulates sclerostin, enhancing Wnt signaling and osteoblastogenesis [^114gyq3b].

- **Periosteal apposition**: Loading increases cortical thickness and bone size, improving strength [^112f9x81].

---

## Evidence from clinical studies

Multiple RCTs and meta-analyses show that exercise increases BMD and improves bone structure in osteoporosis:

| **Study type** | **Population** | **Intervention** | **Outcomes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Meta-analysis | Postmenopausal women | Resistance + impact exercise | ↑ Lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD by 1–3% [^115FuhmL] [^116XK8Gt] |
| Meta-analysis | Older adults | Impact exercise | ↑ Trabecular vBMD at distal tibia; ↑ cortical thickness at radius [^114FtkYe] |
| RCT | Postmenopausal women | Progressive resistance training | ↑ Hip BMD; ↓ falls and fractures [^113m7nFv] [^113m9q7R] |
| RCT | Children/adolescents | Weight-bearing exercise | ↑ BMC and BMD; 0.6–1.7% annual gains [^1153FsSU] |

---

These effects are **site-specific** (loaded regions) and **dose-dependent** (higher intensity and progression yield greater gains) [^1156UPaW] [^114QHKLX].

---

## Optimal exercise prescriptions

Effective programs share common features: **progressive resistance training** at 8–12 RM, 2–3 sets, 2–3 days/week, targeting major muscle groups and bone sites (hip, spine, forearm) [^115LM1DL]; **impact exercises** such as jumping, hopping, or running, ~50 moderate impacts on most days, interspersed with rest [^117LP97G]; and **balance and posture training** to improve stability and reduce falls and vertebral fractures [^113m9q7R] [^113dcCX8].

---

## Safety considerations

Exercise is generally safe for osteoporosis, but precautions are needed: **avoid loaded spinal flexion** — avoid heavy lifting or repetitive flexion to reduce vertebral fracture risk [^114J6wa6] [^116DyEtp]; **supervision and progression** — use supervised, individualized programs, especially with vertebral fractures or frailty [^115LM1DL] [^115inAex]; and **monitoring** — track pain, function, and adverse events to guide progression [^115inAex].

---

## Limitations and gaps in evidence

- **Fracture outcomes**: Few RCTs are powered for fractures; more large, long-term trials are needed [^113i2mbr] [^113J6zVL].

- **Optimal dosing**: The best intensity, frequency, and duration for older adults remain uncertain [^111Wa3uu] [^116eKotf].

- **Adherence**: Long-term adherence and maintenance of benefits need study [^112f9x81] [^116ns3Sx].

---

Exercise **builds bone in osteoporosis** by increasing BMD and improving bone structure, with the greatest benefits from progressive resistance plus impact training; it is safe and recommended when tailored and supervised, and should be part of comprehensive osteoporosis care [^113i2mbr] [^115LM1DL].

Outcome of refining scope through exercise expert consultation

The EESG consideration of scope concluded that two key themes arose from stakeholder consultations: what exercise is effective in increasing bone strength, and what exercise is safe and appropriate for those with, or at risk of, vertebral fractures. Given that the majority of fractures result from a fall, the EESG added exercise for falls prevention as a further theme. User consultation in stakeholder discussion groups (as described above) was undertaken to identify acceptable terminology for these themes, resulting in the following:

Strong: physical activity and exercise to benefit bone strength;
Steady: physical activity and exercise to prevent falls;
Straight: physical activity and exercise to reduce risk of vertebral fracture, improve posture and manage symptoms after vertebral fracture.

Under each theme recommendations were specified for:

All people with osteoporosis. People with osteoporosis were defined here as someone with BMD in the osteoporosis range (a dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) bone density scan measurement T-score < −2.5) or a significant fracture risk (based on fracture risk assessment) with or without fragility fractures (including vertebral).
People with vertebral fractures or multiple low trauma fractures (the latter group may be at more significant risk of vertebral fracture during exercise).
People living with frailty and unsteadiness or those experiencing falls.

Interventions of interest included exercise or other physical activity. Outcomes included BMD or other proxies of bone strength, falls, fracture incidence, spinal curvature/posture and pain related to vertebral fracture. Recommendations were intended to be applicable for community, primary and secondary care settings.

Literature search

The updated searches from previous systematic reviews of exercise and BMD, fallsand outcomes after vertebral fractureyielded 35, 19 and 3 new trials, respectively.

Osteoporosis

OP is characterized by a decrease in bone mineral density (BMD), resulting in an increased risk of fracture. The diagnostic criterion for OP is defined as BMD of more than 2.5 standard deviations below the mean bone density of young adult women, whereas the term 'established osteoporosis' includes the presence of a fragility fracture. Clinically, OP is recognized by characteristic fractures after minimal traumas, most often in the hip, vertebrae, or distal forearm. Clinical consequences of OP fractures include pain and physical disability, with loss of independence and need for long-term care as a consequence. Increased mortality is also seen as a direct result of fracture.

In the Cochrane review 'Exercise for preventing and treating osteoporosis in postmenopausal women', Howe et al. identified 43 RCTs with more than 4000 participants. None of the studies included pain or physical function as an outcome. Concerning disease pathogenesis in terms of BMD, meta-analyses from 24 RCTs with 1,441 participants showed significant differences in favor of exercise for percentage change in BMD at the spine (MD 0.85; 95% CI 0.62 to 1.07), and trochanter (10 RCTs with 815 participants; MD 1.03; 95% CI 0.56 to 1.49) for the comparison of any exercise to any non-exercise control. Thus, there is strong evidence for the effect of exercise on the pathogenesis of OP, which was also confirmed by Pedersen and Saltin. When exploring the most effective intervention for BMD at the spine, Howe et al. found a combination of exercise programs (MD 3.22; 95% CI 1.80 to 4.64) to be most effective, whereas non-weight-bearing high force exercise such as progressive resistance strength training for the legs was most effective for the neck of the femur (MD 1.03; 95% CI 0.24 to 1.82). Prevention of fractures is a main aim in management strategies for OP, and Howe et al. reported that the risk of fracture in exercise groups was not significantly different from that in controls (OR 0.61; 95% CI 0.23 to 1.64 for four RCTs and 539 participants).

### Long-term exercise and bone mineral density changes in postmenopausal women – are there periods of reduced effectiveness? [^112h1NEG]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2016). Low credibility.

There is increasing evidence that physical exercise can prevent fractures in postmenopausal women. However, even with careful adaptation of the exercise program to subjects' changing bone, health, and fitness status, effectivity may still decrease over the time. This could be specifically the case where the limitations of higher age collide with the specification of the exercise program. Thus, the aim of this study was to monitor bone mineral density (BMD) changes over a 16-year period of supervised exercise. Our hypothesis was that BMD differences at lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) between exercisers (EG) and nontraining controls (CG) increased throughout the intervention with significant differences for each of the four 4-year observation periods. Sixty-seven (EG, n = 39 versus CG, n = 28) initially early-postmenopausal osteopenic women of the Erlangen Fitness and Osteoporosis Prevention Study (EFOPS) with complete BMD data sets for baseline (1998) and 4-, 8-, 12-, and 16-year follow-up were included in the analysis. The exercise protocol initially focused on a high-intensity strategy that addressed bone but increasingly shifted to a more comprehensive intervention. LS-BMD differences between the EG and CG continuously increased (year 4: 2.4% (95%- Confidence Interval 1.0% to 3.8%), year 8: 3.1% (1.6% to 4.7%), year 12: 3.9% (1.9% to 5.8), year 16: 4.5% (2.5% to 6.6%). Correspondingly, rising differences for FN-BMD (0.9% (-0.2% to 2.1%) versus 1.9% (0.4% to 3.3%) versus 2.0% (0.5% to 3.8%) versus 3.0% (1.0% to 5.0%)) were observed. However, in contrast to our hypothesis, group differences within the four 4-year periods were not consistently significant (LS, p = 0.001 to 0.097; FN, p = 0.026 to 0.673); further, BMD kinetics among the groups varied between LS and FN. Of particular importance, significant differences (p ≤ 0.030) for both regions were still found in the final period. We conclude that exercise-even when adapted for subjects' decreasing bone, health, and fitness status-is consistently effective in favorably affecting BMD in (initially) early-postmenopausal osteopenic women without any leveling-off effect after 16 years of exercise.

### Nonpharmacological approaches to improve bone health and reduce osteoporosis [^1123QnGb]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

With an aging population, osteoporosis has become a public health concern and an area of increased awareness among both patients and medical practitioners. Timely screening and pharmacologic treatment of low bone mass effectively reduces fracture risk. Nonpharmacologic interventions, however, deserve equal emphasis both in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.

Recent Findings

Recent advances in bone biology have established that exercise in the form of short, repetitive mechanical loading leads to the greatest gains in bone strength. As demonstrated by both observational and randomized exercise intervention trials, these gains are best achieved in childhood but can be maintained in adulthood with continued regular weight-bearing exercise. In the later years, evidence supports the implementation of balance training to decrease fall risk, especially in elderly patients with low bone mass. Following an osteoporotic fracture, a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program with an emphasis on early mobilization, fall prevention, use of orthoses, and noninvasive surgical procedures is emerging as a promising approach.

Summary

Clinically, these findings should imply greater emphasis on high impact exercise during skeletal growth and on maintenance of weight bearing and balance training in the later years. Future research should examine the effect of these interventions on fracture prevention.

### Menopause and exercise [^113ZcYGa]. Menopause (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Accumulating data suggest that regular physical exercise reduces mortality and extends the functional life span of men and women. This review seeks to describe the current state of the medical literature on this topic.

Methods

A narrative review of the current medical literature including randomized clinical trials and clinical guidelines that address the benefits of physical fitness and regular exercise on the health of midlife and postmenopausal women.

Results

Reduction and avoidance of obesity and its related comorbidities (hypertension, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, and heart disease) are one major benefit of exercise. However, long-term physical exercise is also associated with reduced rates of cancer, dementia and cognitive decline, adverse mood and anxiety symptoms, and reduction of osteoporosis, osteopenia, falls, and fractures. Beneficial physical activity includes exercise that will promote cardiovascular fitness (aerobic), muscle strength (resistance), flexibility (stretching), and balance (many of the preceding, and additional activities such as yoga).

Conclusions

Given that it is unambiguously beneficial, inexpensive, and minimal risk, maintaining a healthy exercise regimen should be a goal for every participant to enhance lifelong wellness. Clinicians should use a number of behavioral strategies to support the physical fitness goals of their participants.

Discussion

Health professionals and people with osteoporosis had substantial uncertainty about the efficacy and safety of exercise for those with osteoporosis. However, evidence synthesis confirmed that physical activity and exercise have multiple potential benefits for those with osteoporosis: it may modestly benefit bone strength; improve muscle strength and balance and hence reduce falls risk and reduce kyphosis, which may benefit pain, self-esteem and risk of falls and fractures. Physical activity has a range of other health benefits. We conducted an updated and more thorough analysis of adverse events (particularly fractures) reported during exercise: harms have not been consistently reported, and although a small number of fractures have been reported during exercise, the benefits outweigh the risks. The level of evidence for people who have existing fractures is lower unfortunately; there is inconsistent evidence that exercise could benefit pain, physical function and quality of life. Many of our recommendations for this group are thus based on consensus rather than evidence.

We recommend several overarching principles. Physical activity and exercise have an important role in promoting bone strength, reducing falls risk and managing vertebral fracture symptoms, so they should be part of a broad approach that includes other lifestyle changes, combined with pharmaceutical treatment where appropriate. People with osteoporosis should be encouraged to do more rather than less. This requires professionals to adopt a positive and encouraging approach, focusing on 'how to' messages rather than 'don't do'. Although specific types or exercise may be most effective, even a minimal level of activity should provide some benefit. The evidence indicates that physical activity and exercise is not associated with significant harm, including vertebral fracture; in general, the benefits of physical activity outweigh the risks. Professionals should avoid restricting physical activity or exercise unnecessarily according to BMD or fracture thresholds as this may discourage exercise or activities that promote bone and other health benefits. Finally, people with painful vertebral fractures need clear and prompt guidance on how to adapt movements involved with day-to-day living, including how exercises can help with posture and pain. Anyone with osteoporosis may benefit from guidance on amending some postures and movements to care for their back. Supporting resources were produced.

### Targeted exercise against osteoporosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis for optimising bone strength throughout life [^116TReZy]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Exercise is widely recommended to reduce osteoporosis, falls and related fragility fractures, but its effect on whole bone strength has remained inconclusive. The primary purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects of long-term supervised exercise (≥ 6 months) on estimates of lower-extremity bone strength from childhood to older age.

Methods

We searched four databases (PubMed, Sport Discus, Physical Education Index, and Embase) up to October 2009 and included 10 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the effects of exercise training on whole bone strength. We analysed the results by age groups (childhood, adolescence, and young and older adulthood) and compared the changes to habitually active or sedentary controls. To calculate standardized mean differences (SMD; effect size), we used the follow-up values of bone strength measures adjusted for baseline bone values. An inverse variance-weighted random-effects model was used to pool the results across studies.

Results

Our quality analysis revealed that exercise regimens were heterogeneous; some trials were short in duration and small in sample size, and the weekly training doses varied considerably between trials. We found a small and significant exercise effect among pre- and early pubertal boys [SMD, effect size, 0.17 (95% CI, 0.02–0.32)], but not among pubertal girls [-0.01 (-0.18 to 0.17)], adolescent boys [0.10 (-0.75 to 0.95)], adolescent girls [0.21 (-0.53 to 0.97)], premenopausal women [0.00 (-0.43 to 0.44)] or postmenopausal women [0.00 (-0.15 to 0.15)]. Evidence based on per-protocol analyses of individual trials in children and adolescents indicated that programmes incorporating regular weight-bearing exercise can result in 1% to 8% improvements in bone strength at the loaded skeletal sites. In premenopausal women with high exercise compliance, improvements ranging from 0.5% to 2.5% have been reported.

Conclusions

The findings from our meta-analysis of RCTs indicate that exercise can significantly enhance bone strength at loaded sites in children but not in adults. Since few RCTs were conducted to investigate exercise effects on bone strength, there is still a need for further well-designed, long-term RCTs with adequate sample sizes to quantify the effects of exercise on whole bone strength and its structural determinants throughout life.

### Targeted exercise against osteoporosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis for optimising bone strength throughout life [^1153266W]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusion and Future Directions

The benefits of exercise on the clinically relevant DXA measures of BMC and BMD are well established. However, the findings from our systematic review and meta-analyses of published exercise RCTs using (p)QCT, MRI or DXA HSA indicated a small but significant exercise effect on bone strength in young boys but not young girls, adolescent boys or girls or middle-aged and older adults. On the other hand, we acknowledge that there are few long-term, adequately powered RCTs that have investigated exercise effects on bone strength. The available interventions incorporated a variety of different exercise programmes with relatively small sample sizes, short follow-up periods, varied types and doses of training and measurements of different skeletal sites using different imaging techniques. Therefore, we think that it is premature to draw any definitive conclusions with regard to the effects of exercise on bone strength.

Despite the above-noted limitations, the current data from several intervention trials in children indicate that programmes incorporating a diverse range of weight-bearing impact activities can enhance the mass, structure and strength of bone, particularly in boys during the prepubertal years. In middle-aged and older adults, the evidence for a beneficial effect of training on bone strength was less definitive due to the limited number and short average duration of the available RCTs. However, epidemiological evidence suggests that moderate to vigorous physical activity performed three to four times per week is associated with considerably lower incidence of fragility fractures in both women and men. In addition, findings from cross-sectional studies of adult athletes suggest that regular exercise for many years has the potential to substantially improve bone strength. The findings from these studies also suggest that exercise regimens that include moderate- to high-magnitude impacts from varying loading directions (high- and odd-impact exercise) may represent the optimal mode to enhance bone structure and strength.

### Osteoporosis: part II. nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment [^11599h6k]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Family physicians will frequently encounter patients with osteoporosis, a condition that is often asymptomatic until a fracture occurs. Treatment of the fracture can be initiated without further diagnostic testing. Thereafter, treatment of osteoporosis includes (1) prevention of further bone loss through weight-bearing exercise, tobacco and alcohol avoidance, hormone replacement therapy in women, and raloxifene and calcium supplementation; (2) treatment of fracture-related pain with analgesics and calcitonin; (3) building bone mass when feasible with alendronate; and (4) modifying behaviors that increase the risk of falls. Patients without fracture who are at risk for osteoporosis can also benefit from these preventive measures. Furthermore, women of all ages should be encouraged to maintain a daily calcium intake of 1,000 to 1,500 mg and to participate in weight-bearing exercise for 30 minutes three times weekly to reduce their risk of falls and fractures. Persons at risk should avoid medications known to compromise bone density, such as glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones and chronic heparin therapy.

Bone strength

A combination of high load resistance exercise or weightbearing exercise with impact appears the most effective for bone strength. Moderate impact exercise may be more effective but lower impact (equivalent to brisk walking) was advised in those with vertebral fractures or multiple low trauma fractures. Several recent reviews confirmed the efficacy of resistance exercise; one reported no benefit but was selective in the studies included. Consistent with previous guidance, we recommend that resistance exercise should progress to high intensity. Although some recent meta-analyses did not detect greater benefits from high than lower load resistance exercise, some of the interventions classified as high intensity were of more moderate loading, and substantial heterogeneity meant that it was not possible to detect significant differences according to intensity. One recent meta-analysis confirmed that high-intensity training was more effective than moderate intensity at the lumbar spine.

Falls risk

A high proportion of fractures result from falls, and we recommend strength and balance training to reduce fall incidence, based on a large body of evidence. Exercise is effective in preventing fall-related injuries in people with osteoporosis, and in the broader population, participants randomised to exercise interventions had 26% fewer injurious falls, and 16% fewer fractures, than those randomised to control groups. This highlights that although health practitioners and people with osteoporosis may be concerned about vertebral fractures sustained during exercise that can directly be attributed to the exercise, it is important to balance this concern with the injuries prevented by exercise despite it being much harder to directly attribute an injury to not exercising.

Bone Strength

Our analysis of the published RCTs examining the exercise effects on bone strength in older women did not find a significant overall effect or any site-specific effects (Figure 6). In a recent, yet unpublished, 18-month RCT in middle-aged and older men, high-intensity progressive resistance training combined with moderate-impact weight-bearing exercise increased femoral neck strength by 2% relative to no exercise, but there was no effect of exercise on bone strength at the tibial and femoral midshafts. Consistent with the latter finding, a recent systematic review among postmenopausal women, which included all pQCT studies (RCTs and cross-sectional and prospective studies) in their analysis, concluded that exercise has a positive but modest site-specific effect on bone mass and geometry at the loaded skeletal sites, primarily affecting cortical rather than trabecular bone. The authors also concluded that the mass and geometric changes appear to be largely dependent on continued participation and participants' ability to maintain sufficient exercise intensity.

### Strong, steady and straight: UK consensus statement on physical activity and exercise for osteoporosis [^117XgWw2]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Exercise and physical activity can improve bone strength and the risk of falls, which may offer benefits in the prevention and management of osteoporosis. However, uncertainty about the types of exercise that are safe and effective instigates lack of confidence in people with osteoporosis and health professionals. Existing guidelines leave some questions unresolved. This consensus statement aimed to determine the physical activity and exercise needed to optimise bone strength, reduce fall and fracture risk, improve posture and manage vertebral fracture symptoms, while minimising potential risks in people with osteoporosis. The scope of this statement was developed following stakeholder consultation. Meta-analyses were reviewed and where evidence was lacking, individual studies or expert opinion were used to develop recommendations. A multidisciplinary expert group reviewed evidence to make recommendations, by consensus when evidence was not available. Key recommendations are that people with osteoporosis should undertake (1) resistance and impact exercise to maximise bone strength; (2) activities to improve strength and balance to reduce falls; (3) spinal extension exercise to improve posture and potentially reduce risk of falls and vertebral fractures. For safety, we recommend avoiding postures involving a high degree of spinal flexion during exercise or daily life. People with vertebral fracture or multiple low trauma fractures should usually exercise only up to an impact equivalent to brisk walking. Those at risk of falls should start with targeted strength and balance training. Vertebral fracture symptoms may benefit from exercise to reduce pain, improve mobility and quality of life, ideally with specialist advice to encourage return to normal activities. Everyone with osteoporosis may benefit from guidance on adapting postures and movements. There is little evidence that physical activity is associated with significant harm, and the benefits, in general, outweigh the risks.

Stakeholder meetings for those with, or at risk of, osteoporosis were attended by 27 people (25 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis with two of their spouses). The professionals' stakeholder meeting was attended by 13 health or exercise professionals (four physiotherapists, three osteoporosis specialist nurses, three Pilates instructors and three health professionals with osteoporosis).

The stakeholder group discussions identified that people with osteoporosis viewed exercise and physical activity as very important with wide-ranging benefits on health and well-being, and areas of frustration, about being given no, conflicting or negative 'don't do' exercise advice by health professionals. Areas of uncertainty, for both non-professionals and professionals alike included what exercise was 'best' and safe to improve specific and general bone and muscle strength, dependent on ability. People with osteoporosis wanted more specific information about exercise regimens to guide safe functional activity, and professionals wanted more information about how to tailor advice, dependent on patient characteristics.

A total of 880 stakeholders participated in the online survey. Of those who provided demographic information, > 70% were aged between 56 and 75 years; 772 (94%) described their ethnic origin as 'white' and 782 (96%) said they were female. Most respondents were people with osteoporosis: 521 (61%) diagnosed from a bone density scan; 83 (10%) reported one spinal fracture and 114 (13%) reported more than one spinal fracture; 148 (17%) had other fragility fractures; 44 (5%) said they were less mobile and unaccustomed to regular exercise. One hundred and thirty-nine respondents (16%) were health professionals.

Of the respondents who provided specific queries, 44% wanted to know what exercise was effective for strengthening bones (including specific questions on type, intensity and duration, or site-specific exercise) and 38% wanted to know about the role of exercise in prevention or management of vertebral fractures. Over a third had questions about the safety of specific exercises, such as Pilates or yoga positions. Questions about equipment, including vibration platforms, were asked. There was substantial uncertainty about what exercise was effective or safe, from both health professionals and those with osteoporosis.

The preferred format for receiving information was leaflets (90%) online video clips (59%) and DVDs (36%).

### Beat osteoporosis-nourish and exercise skeletons (BONES): a group randomized controlled trial in children [^112p4LoP]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Childhood is a crucial period of social, cognitive, and physiological development. Habits acquired then are often sustained throughout the lifespan, emphasizing the need to engage children with healthy behaviors early in life. Children who meet recommendations for physical activity and appropriate nutrition tend to have stronger bones, better cardiovascular health, and exhibit better academic performance and higher self-esteem. Unfortunately, American children today spend less time in physical activity and consume inadequate amounts of key nutrients which could impede their growth and development. Therefore, it is worthwhile to develop evidence-based programs that engage children in health behaviors that will encourage a strong foundation for adulthood.

Among the many health behaviors that are critical during childhood are weight-bearing physical activity and calcium consumption. These behaviors independently and synergistically contribute to bone mass accrual which is critical for strong skeletal development. Peak bone mass is reached by most individuals during adolescence, and low accumulation of bone mineral during pre-pubertal years increases risk of fractures and the porous and weak bones which are hallmarks of osteoporosis later in life. To mitigate this risk, the Surgeon General's Report on Bone Health and Osteoporosis suggested teaching youth healthy bone-building behaviors that can be incorporated into children's daily routines.

### Effects of mind-body exercises for osteoporosis in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114rn8qS]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

Bone mineral density

Bone mineral density as the main indicators to assess the severity of osteoporosis, so 31 included trials -,-,-,-,- measured BMD, and we assessed BMD classified by different participants, body parts and interventions in this study.

For different participants, a random-effects model was used because of the high heterogeneity of the pooled results (I 2 = 91%, P < .00001). The pooled result showed that the overall effect on mind-body exercise for different kind of participants was significant when compared with control groups (MD = .05, 95% CI [.03,.08], P.00001, n = 1452). Twelve included trials -, focused on menopause women (MD = .05, 95% CI [.00,.10], P = .04, n = 525); 7 trials, focused on elderly people both men and women (MD = .08, 95% CI [.04,.12], P = .0001, n = 506); only 1focused on elderly men (MD = .01, 95% CI -[.00,.03], P = .06, n = 45); while 5 trials, focused on elderly women showed no significant difference between mind-body exercises and control groups (MD = .03, 95% CI [.01,.04], P = .003, n = 376).

### Exercise for preventing and treating osteoporosis in postmenopausal women [^115FuhmL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Osteoporosis is a condition resulting in an increased risk of skeletal fractures due to a reduction in the density of bone tissue. Treatment of osteoporosis typically involves the use of pharmacological agents. In general it is thought that disuse (prolonged periods of inactivity) and unloading of the skeleton promotes reduced bone mass, whereas mechanical loading through exercise increases bone mass.

Objectives

To examine the effectiveness of exercise interventions in preventing bone loss and fractures in postmenopausal women.

Search Strategy

During the update of this review we updated the original search strategy by searching up to December 2010 the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group's Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2010 Issue 12); MEDLINE; EMBASE; HealthSTAR; Sports Discus; CINAHL; PEDro; Web of Science; Controlled Clinical Trials; and AMED. We attempted to identify other studies by contacting experts, searching reference lists and searching trial registers.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that met our predetermined inclusion criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Pairs of members of the review team extracted the data and assessed trial quality using predetermined forms. For dichotomous outcomes (fractures), we calculated risk ratios (RRs) using a fixed-effect model. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MDs) of the percentage change from baseline. Where heterogeneity existed (determined by the I(2) statistic), we used a random-effects model.

Main Results

Forty-three RCTs (27 new in this update) with 4320 participants met the inclusion criteria. The most effective type of exercise intervention on bone mineral density (BMD) for the neck of femur appears to be non-weight bearing high force exercise such as progressive resistance strength training for the lower limbs (MD 1.03; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 1.82). The most effective intervention for BMD at the spine was combination exercise programmes (MD 3.22; 95% CI 1.80 to 4.64) compared with control groups. Fractures and falls were reported as adverse events in some studies. There was no effect on numbers of fractures (odds ratio (OR) 0.61; 95% CI 0.23 to 1.64). Overall, the quality of the reporting of studies in the meta-analyses was low, in particular in the areas of sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding and loss to follow-up.

Authors' Conclusions

Our results suggest a relatively small statistically significant, but possibly important, effect of exercise on bone density compared with control groups. Exercise has the potential to be a safe and effective way to avert bone loss in postmenopausal women.

### Discontinuation of hormone therapy and bone mineral density: does physical activity modify that relationship? [^1176iS1X]. Menopause (2023). Medium credibility.

Menopause is defined as the cessation of menstrual cycles due to decline of follicular ovarian function and results in the onset of various expected physiological changes, including decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) due to declining ovarian estrogen production. Estrogen is a naturally occurring physiological hormone that helps to control osteoclast activity. After menopause, BMD loss can occur because of drops in endogenous estrogen production, resulting is greater bone resorption by osteoclastic cells and reduction in new bone formation. As a result, postmenopausal women are at greater risk for experiencing significant drops in BMD and increasing their risk for the development of osteoporosis and bone fracture.

Menopausal hormone therapy (HT) use in postmenopausal women can reduce bone loss. However, HT use in postmenopausal women has been met with hesitancy since the results of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) estrogen plus progestin trial in 2002. The trial showed higher risk than benefit in older women taking HT. The risks included heart disease, stroke, and breast cancer. Hip and total fracture reductions, and bone density increases, were shown to be the major benefit of estrogen plus progestin. However, discontinuation of HT use can result in bone loss similar to that which occurs at the time of menopause. BMD returns to pre-HT treatment levels after HT discontinuation.

There is some evidence that certain types of sustained physical activity (PA) in women can provide benefit to BMD. Weight-bearing exercise and resistance training early in life have the greatest positive impact on improvements in BMD. However, after menopause, PA can still help maintain BMD at specific bone sites, including the femoral neck, lumbar spine, and trochanter. The relationship between PA and BMD in postmenopausal women over age 65 as explored by Pinheiro et al in their 2020 systematic review concluded that physical activity that is diverse in exercise types, specifically resistance training, plays a role in osteoporosis prevention. The data indicated that the bone response may vary by body region and higher dose exercise programs are more effective. In addition findings from Gonzalo-Encabo et al in 400 postmenopausal women participating in a 12-month exercise intervention suggested that postmenopausal women could prevent some BMD loss with greater volumes of aerobic exercise, specifically those involving weight-bearing components. Overall, this study suggested a dose-response effect for greater maintenance of BMD with higher PA levels.

### Strong, steady and straight: UK consensus statement on physical activity and exercise for osteoporosis [^117LP97G]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Summary of exercise recommendations (from Royal Osteoporosis Society). Most research evidence is based on formal exercise. The suggested sports and activities include some with research evidence and some that may safely help engagement in activity and improve quality of life based on expert consensus.

Weightbearing or impact activity includes running, jumping, aerobics, some forms of dancing and many ball games and sport. As it does not necessarily require specialist facilities or equipment, this can be more accessible for many people than resistance exercise. Previous guidance recommends aerobic exercise for 30 min per day, 5 days a week, to comply with recommendations for other health outcomes, but this may not necessarily include exercise with sufficient gravitational loading to increase bone strength. Australian recommendations are more specific in suggesting impact exercise on 4–7 days per week, with each session including 50 jumps: 3–5 sets of 10–20 repetitions with 1–2 min rest between sets. They recommended high intensity (> 4 times body weight (BW)), which may be encountered in gymnastics or drop jumps) for those without osteoporosis, and 2–4 BW for those at moderate risk of osteoporosis. Because of the lack of evidence of greater benefit of the high versus moderate intensity, EESG consensus was to recommend moderate impact exercise, such as jumps, skipping, hopping, running, higher impact forms of dance such as Scottish dancing or Zumba, or ball sports (figure 1) but not very high impact exercise such as landing from height. Consistent with Australian guidance, the recommended volume and frequency was ~50 moderate impacts interspersed with rest pauses, on most days.

### Targeted exercise against osteoporosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis for optimising bone strength throughout life [^112CNgbv]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

BMD

In postmenopausal women, there are mixed results from several meta-analyses reviewing the effects of aerobic training, weight-bearing impact exercise, resistance training or their combination on BMD. In general, the findings from these meta-analyses indicate that lumbar spine BMD can be increased by 1%-2% following resistance training, but findings from the femoral neck have been somewhat contradictory. According to several meta-analyses, endurance training or walking appears to have little or no effect on either femoral neck or lumbar spine BMD. However, a recent meta-analysis reported that mixed-impact loading programs including low- to moderate-impact exercises such as jogging, walking and stair climbing were most effective for preserving BMD at the lumbar spine and femoral neck when combined with resistance training. Interestingly, more demanding high-impact jumping programs without other exercises were ineffective. This suggests that these habitual low-impact exercises combined with other forms of training may be a feasible training mode to preserve BMD in postmenopausal women.

To our knowledge, only one RCT investigating exercise effects on BMD has been conducted in middle-aged and older men alone. In this 12-month trial in healthy community-dwelling men aged 50 to 79 years, a combination of high-intensity progressive resistance training with a diverse range of moderate-impact weight-bearing exercises performed three times per week resulted in a 2% net gain in femoral neck BMD relative to no exercise.

Refining scope through exercise expert consultation

A UK Expert Exercise Steering Group (EESG) consisting of 12 clinical and academic experts developed the consensus statement (online supplemental appendix III). This group included four physiotherapists, three rheumatologists, three academics and an osteoporosis specialist nurse; all but one of whom were female. Nine were clinically active with mean (SD) 18 (13) years of clinical experience, and ten were research active with 18 (11) years research experience. A wider UK Exercise Expert Working group (EEWG) consisted of a further 16 experts: nine physiotherapists, two patient representatives, two patient advocates, an exercise instructor, nurse and physiologist; 13 female and 3 male (online supplemental appendix III). Experts were selected to provide relevant clinical, research expertise and/or lived experience, often through contacts of the Royal Osteoporosis Society clinical and scientific advisory committees, or professional bodies (such as the Chartered Society of Physiotherapists).

The scope was refined by the EESG by teleconference and email, and evidence synthesised. The scope and evidence were then reviewed in a full day, face-to-face meeting of the EESG and EEWG in London in September 2017. A summary was circulated, with all members invited to comment.

Literature search strategy

The EESG identified several international osteoporosis and falls prevention guidance documents, meta-analyses and systematic reviews. These have synthesised the published evidence, agreed key principles and reported evidenceand consensus-based guidance. The EESG agreed a pragmatic approach to review and update existing literature reviews and that a further systematic review of all the scientific and clinical evidence was not indicated. We thus repeated the searches conducted in previous systematic reviews of exercise and BMD; fallsand outcomes after vertebral fracture.

Limited literature was available on the adverse events and safety issues associated with physical activity and exercise for adults with osteoporosis and osteopenia so a systematic review was undertaken that has been published separately.

Strong: physical activity and exercise to promote bone strength and prevent fractures

Research evidence underlying recommendations is summarised in online supplemental appendix V. This evidence was considered alongside previous guidanceand EESG consensus to agree recommendations (Box 1).

Box 1
Recommendations for exercise to promote bone strength

The combination of impact and progressive resistance training best promotes bone strengthas reflected in other national guidance.

Resistance exercise is ideally supervised to ensure good technique and minimise injury risk, with interventions starting with lower loads while correct technique is attained. For consistent gains, resistance exercise should be progressive — that is, loads gradually increased. The ultimate intensity recommended previously was 8–12 repetitions maximum (RM) — that is, the maximum weight that could be lifted 8–12 times or 8 repetitions at 80–85% 1 RM — that is, 80–85% of the maximum load that could be lifted just once. Both recommend increasing to two to three sets. EESG consensus was that recommending an 8–12 RM was easier to implement outside a formal laboratory setting, although supervised progressive resistance training at higher intensity is likely to have greatest effects on BMD.

Resistance exercises involving major muscle groups should be used to load skeletal sites at risk of osteoporotic fracture, such as the spine, proximal femur and forearm. This may be achieved through one exercise each for legs, arms, chest, shoulders and back using exercise bands, weights or body weight, or eight exercises targeting major muscle groups of the hip and spine, including weighted lunges, hip abduction/adduction, knee extension/flexion, plantar–dorsiflexion, back extension, reverse chest fly, and abdominal exercises(while avoiding loaded spinal flexion). The latter recommendation could be replaced by fewer compound movements, such as squats and dead lifts. Such activities should be performed on two or three days of the week. While evidence relates to progressive resistance training, performed usually in a formal exercise setting or using specialist equipment, such activities are undertaken by only a small proportion of the population. To enable activity, EESG consensus was that other sports or leisure activities that might promote muscle strength should also be encouraged, such as circuit training, rowing, Pilates or yoga, stair climbing, sit to stands, heavy housework or gardening and carrying shopping, although repeated or end-range flexion should be avoided in these activities (figure 1).

### Current perspectives on aerobic exercise in people with Parkinson's disease [^113eRhek]. Neurotherapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Bone Health and Fractures

Regular physical activity is associated with improved bone health in older adults. People with PD are generally less physically active than their healthy counterparts, which may contribute to the development of osteoporosis in PD. Indeed, osteoporosis is very common in people with PD, who have a lower bone mineral density and reduced bone strength compared with healthy people. Apart from inactivity, other contributing factors include vitamin D deficiency, reduced muscle strength, poor mobility, and hyperhomocysteinemia (i.e. catabolism of homocysteine, a status associated with risk of fractures and a low bone mineral density; this status is possibly aggravated by levodopa use). Along with their gait deficits and postural instability (leading to falls), osteoporosis places people with PD at risk of sustaining fractures. Moreover, the combination of PD and osteoporosis has been associated with pain, sleep problems, depression, and anxiety. These consequences might be countered by weight-bearing aerobic exercise (brisk walking, running), which stresses the bones and thereby promotes bone growth and bone strength in healthy older adults. The effect of aerobic exercise on bone health and osteoporosis in PD remains to be shown, but simple interventions such as brisk walking seem promising.

Preventing Parkinson's Disease

Epidemiological studies suggest that in the general population, people who are physically more active may be at lower risk of developing PD. Interestingly, premorbid physical activity also seems to influence disease symptom onset. For example, the chance of developing prodromal features of PD (constipation, bodily pain, depression, and excessive daytime sleepiness) is negatively associated with physical activity, as is motor symptom onset. It is unclear whether physical activity and aerobic exercise can actually prevent or delay the development of PD itself (i.e. by slowing the underlying neurodegenerative process itself) or whether this induces compensatory effects in other brain areas that delay the manifestation of PD symptoms. Further research into the underlying mechanisms of the potential neuroprotective effect of physical activity and exercise is needed and is also elaborated upon in the discussion of this review.

Effects of exercise on bone strength in adults

BMD

In premenopausal women, the findings from several meta-analyses of RCTs examining the effects of different modes of exercise on BMD indicate that resistance training and high-impact weight-bearing exercise, alone or in combination, can produce 1%-2% gains at the lumbar spine and femoral neck. Although not all RCTs have reported beneficial effects, the findings from the meta-analyses indicate that high-intensity progressive resistance training appears to be more effective for improving vertebral BMD, whereas high-impact training results in greater gains in femoral neck BMD. Whether exercise has a beneficial effect on BMD in young men is not clear, because few RCTs have been conducted in this population. However, one meta-analysis of randomised and nonrandomised trials incorporating both young and older men reported a site-specific beneficial effect of exercise on BMD in men aged older than 31 years versus those younger than 31 years.

Bone Strength

With regard to the effects of exercise on bone strength during early adulthood, only one RCT was recently conducted in premenopausal women. Our analysis from this 12-month progressive impact exercise trial with additional home training did not indicate any effect on bone strength at either the proximal tibia or femoral shaft (Figure 5). However, the authors' subgroup analysis of the exercise group revealed that those women who were most compliant (the highest quartile, > 66 exercise sessions during the 12 months) had a 0.5%-2.5% greater gain in bone size, cortical thickness and bone strength at the proximal tibia than those who were in the least compliant quartile (< 19 sessions).

### Exercise for bone health: rationale and prescription [^114gyq3b]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Patients frequently inquire about exercise as a means to improve bone strength and reduce osteoporotic fracture. Understanding the biologic mechanisms and the available clinical evidence supporting the role of exercise in bone health is the key to an educated discussion.

Recent Findings

Exercise downregulates sclerostin expression by the osteocyte favoring osteoblastogenesis. These changes are enhanced by dynamic cyclical load with rest periods and may be promoted by low-amplitude high-frequency stimuli. In the prepubertal years, exercise results in periosteal gains, whereas exercise later in life maintains bone mass, reduces falls and probably associated fractures, and improves quality-of-life measures.

Summary

Future studies should examine the effect of exercise on bone strength and determine the minimum quantity and frequency and the exercise type most effective to reduce osteoporotic fractures.

### Strong, steady and straight: UK consensus statement on physical activity and exercise for osteoporosis [^115g556H]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this consensus statement is to provide guidance on the role of exercise and physical activity in the prevention and management of osteoporosis.

The specific aims are to:

Clarify the role of physical activity and exercise for optimising bone strength and reducing falls and fracture risk.
Clarify the role of physical activity and exercise in managing the pain and symptoms of vertebral fracture.
Review any safety issues of exercise for those with osteoporosis, to address fears of causing fractures (particularly in the spine) while engaging in exercise or day-to-day physical activities.
Promote confidence and a positive approach so that people with osteoporosis do more rather than less exercise and physical activity.
Ensure consistent advice for people with osteoporosis so that people can exercise safely and effectively.

The target population is people with osteoporosis, who have bone mineral density measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry in the osteoporotic range or a significant fracture risk based on a fracture risk assessment score, with or without fragility fracture. Separate consideration is made for those with vertebral or multiple low trauma fractures and for those who are living with frailty and are unsteady or experiencing falls. Physical activity includes any activity, whatever the purpose, that increases energy expenditure, while exercise is structured physical activity performed to enhance or maintain performance or health.

This document updates the principles underpinning previous guidance on exercise and physical activity and distils current research evidence for people with osteoporosis. This guidance is developed for clinicians, including physiotherapists and exercise practitioners, as well as policy makers, and is designed to inform clinical practice and policy.

### Exercise for preventing and treating osteoporosis in postmenopausal women [^117ExwTj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Osteoporosis is a condition resulting in an increased risk of skeletal fractures due to a reduction in the density of bone tissue. Prevention of osteoporotic-related fractures is dependent on the ability to detect individuals with low bone mass, including those women who are asymptomatic. Treatment of osteoporosis involves the use of either anti-resorptive (e.g. estrogen and bisphosphonate) or bone formation agents (e.g. fluoride and PTH). The value of exercise as an intervention for the prevention of postmenopausal bone loss is a controversial subject.

Objectives

To examine the effectiveness of exercise therapy at preventing bone loss and fractures in postmenopausal women.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group's specialised register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Contents and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry up to January 2000 according to the methods suggested by Dickersin et al and Haynes et al and the Cochrane Handbook. We hand searched reference lists and consulted content experts.

Selection Criteria

This review was proceeded by a peer reviewed protocol published in the Cochrane Library. Two reviewers independently selected all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which met our predetermined inclusion criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

The same two reviewers abstracted the data using predetermined forms and assessed trial quality using a validated assessment tool. For dichotomous outcomes (fractures), relative risks were calculated using fixed effects models. For continuous data, weighted mean differences (WMD) of the percentage change from baseline were calculated. Where heterogeneity existed (determined by a chi square test), a random effects model was used.

Main Results

Eighteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) met the inclusion criteria. The trials had a mean methodological quality score of 2.53. Aerobics, weight bearing and resistance exercises were all effective on the BMD of the spine. The WMD for the combined aerobics and weight bearing program on the spine was 1.79 [95%CI (0.58, 3.01)]. The analyzed results showed walking to be effective on both BMD of the spine 1.31[95%CI (-0.03, 2.65) and the hip 0.92[95%CI (0.21, 1.64). Aerobic exercise was effective in increasing BMD of the wrist 1.22[95%CI (0.71, 1.74)].

Reviewer's Conclusions

Aerobics, weight bearing and resistance exercises are all effective in increasing the BMD of the spine in postmenopausal women. Walking is also effective on the hip. The quality of the reporting of the trials in the meta-analysis was low, in particular, in the areas of allocation concealement and blinding.

### Osteoporosis prevention, screening, and diagnosis: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 1 [^117LQgH8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To provide updated evidence-based recommendations for the prevention, screening, and diagnosis of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

Target Population

Postmenopausal patients without identified risk factors for fracture, low bone mineral density, or secondary osteoporosis related to medication or a medical condition.

Methods

This guideline was developed using an a priori protocol in conjunction with a writing team consisting of two specialists in obstetrics and gynecology appointed by the ACOG Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines-Gynecology and one external subject matter expert. ACOG medical librarians completed a comprehensive literature search for primary literature within the Cochrane Library, Cochrane Collaboration Registry of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, PubMed, and MEDLINE. Studies that moved forward to the full-text screening stage were assessed by two authors from the writing team on the basis of standardized inclusion and exclusion criteria. Included studies underwent quality assessment, and a modified GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) evidence-to-decision framework was applied to interpret and translate the evidence into recommendation statements.

Recommendations

This Clinical Practice Guideline includes updated recommendations on the role of exercise, calcium, and vitamin D in osteoporosis prevention; osteoporosis screening and diagnosis; rescreening intervals; and interventions to prevent falls. Recommendations are classified by strength and evidence quality. Ungraded Good Practice Points are included to provide guidance when a formal recommendation could not be made because of inadequate or nonexistent evidence.

### Effects of mind-body exercises for osteoporosis in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111nS9YU]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

According to the latest World Population Prospects report, the global population aged 65 and over will reach 771 million by 2022 and is expected to grow to 1.6 billion by 2050. The morbidity of some conditions, such as osteoporosis, increases with age. Osteoporosis is a disorder of the skeletal system and the main symptom is a reduction in bone mineral density, which is a major cause of fractures and even a life-threatening cause in older people. Approximately 200 million women are affected by osteoporosis worldwide. In women over 50 years old, 1 third of these fractures will be associated with osteoporosis, whereas in men over 50 years old, 1 fifth will experience osteoporosis-related fractures. Osteoporosis is a chronic disease characterized by low bone mass and disruption of bone architecture, resulting in reduced bone strength and increased risk of fracture, leading to reduced quality of life and high costs to individuals and society. Unfortunately, conventional treatment for patients with osteoporosis is not available and only a small proportion of patients are eligible for rehabilitation programs according to osteoporosis guidelines.

Mind-body exercises such as taichi, dance, yoga, eight-section brocade, 5 mimic-animal exercises, yi jinjing and pilates are considered complementary therapies that are beneficial interventions for improving flexibility, controlling body balance and reducing pain. In recent years, several clinical trials and meta-analyses have reported a positive effect of exercise on pain and quality of life in older people with osteoporosis.

The high prevalence and cost of osteoporotic fractures, particularly in the ageing population, make prevention and management of this condition important. Mind-body exercise on bone as a non-pharmacological intervention has been focused. A systematic review is required to carry in this area and summarize the evidence for clinical health care, policymakers, and all with an interest in this area. Meta-analysis as a research method can improve the effectiveness of statistical analysis, reveal uncertainties in individual studies, identify general findings and differences between individual studies, suggest new research topics and research directions, and save research costs. Therefore, in this study, a meta-analysis was performed to assess the effect of mind-body exercise on osteoporosis in aging people.

### Drug insight: existing and emerging therapies for osteoporosis [^116D3kWt]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2006). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis is a major public health problem that is characterized by microarchitectural deterioration, low bone mass, and increased risk of fractures. Currently, many women and men affected with this disease are not diagnosed or treated. As osteoporosis is often clinically silent, risk-factor assessment and measurement of BMD are needed to identify those who may benefit from osteoporosis therapy. Although adequate daily intake of calcium and vitamin D, and regular weight-bearing exercise are important for skeletal health, they are not adequate treatments for individuals with osteoporosis. Therapies approved for treatment and/or prevention of osteoporosis in the United States include oral bisphosphonates (alendronate, ibandronate and risedronate), calcitonin, estrogens, teriparatide (parathyroid hormone fragment [1–34]), and raloxifene. For most patients, oral bisphosphonates are the treatment of choice, given the large-scale randomized-trial data demonstrating efficacy in fracture reduction, although bisphosphonates that reduce spine and nonspine fractures (e.g. alendronate and risedronate) are preferred. For high-risk patients (those with very low bone density, or with fractures), teriparatide therapy for 2 years should be considered. The treatment paradigm for osteoporosis will evolve further as promising new treatments progress through clinical development.

Information Sources and Search

For this systematic review and meta-analysis, an experienced medical librarian conducted a search of four databases (PubMed, Sport Discus, Physical Education Index, and Embase) using a comprehensive combination of keywords describing exercise: exercise movement techniques, exercise, exercise therapy, physical education and training, sports, physical fitness, physical activity, physical training, exercise training, physical exercise, physical education and motor activity. The keywords describing bone strength included bone structure, bone strength, bone rigidity, bone geometry, bone and bones. The authors RD, AH and RN also used cross-referencing from retrieved articles and conducted a hand search to identify possible missed RCTs in database searches.

Two authors (AH and RN) independently reviewed all screened abstracts. Then AH and RN, together with RD, independently evaluated all potential full-text articles. If there was disagreement whether to include a full-text article, all authors evaluated the article to come to a joint consensus. Similarly, the methodological quality was individually assessed by AH and RN together with RD. AH then extracted the data from the original full-text articles, and RN and RD rechecked all relevant data, including all outcome values needed for the analysis. Two RCTs where participants were taking either anti-osteoporotic medication or hormone replacement therapy were included because the study arms were equally distributed. Only exercise arms and non-exercise arms without treatment were analysed in these trials because interaction effects were not reported. However, two other exercise trials including multiple but heterogeneous exercise groups in their exercise regimen were treated as independent in our analysis.

### Osteoporosis issues regarding rehabilitation in women [^111pDP17]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis is the most common metabolic bone disease across the world resulting from compromised bone microstructure and decreased bone mineral density. It primarily impacts postmenopausal women over 50 years placing them at heightened risk for fractures. The pathophysiology involves an imbalance in bone resorption and production. Nonpharmacologic approaches can bolster a treatment plan, namely with alterations in nutrition and exercise. The first clinical indication of osteoporosis is typically a fracture, which is mostly found to be a vertebral compression fracture. Osteoporosis is a highly treatable and preventable condition that can result in high morbidity and mortality if not adequately addressed.

Loading Characteristics to Best Improve Bone Strength

There is considerable interest in defining the optimal dose(s) and characteristics of loading to best improve bone strength (i.e. optimal loading type and programme) so that precise exercise prescription guidelines can be developed. Extensive research using animal models has shown that the skeleton's response to loading is regulated by a number of different loading characteristics, including the magnitude, rate, distribution (pattern) and number of loading cycles.

Consistent with these findings, data from the available cross-sectional studies and limited intervention trials in children that have used (p)QCT or MRI to characterise changes in bone structure and strength indicate that the most effective programmes (or loading characteristics) are those that incorporate a combination of moderate- to high-impact weight-bearing activities that are variable in nature (i.e. multidirectional) and applied rapidly. Specifically, the most successful exercise programmes appear to be those that incorporate a diverse range of weight-bearing activities (e.g. skipping, dancing, jumping, and hopping) ranging in magnitude from three to nine times body weight and which are performed three to five times per week, preferably on a daily basis, for 10–45 minutes per session.

In middle-aged and older adults, the optimal type and dose of exercise needed to enhance bone geometry and strength is less definitive. The general consensus from recent intervention trials and meta-analyses with BMD as the primary outcome is that low- to moderate-impact weight-bearing exercise in combination with progressive resistance and/or agility training tends to be the most effective for improving hip and spine BMD (or preventing bone loss) and functional ability in both older men and women. However, further work is still needed to define the specific types of exercises and the associated loads related to these activities that can be safely performed by older adults at varying levels of physical function and fracture risk. While certain moderate- to high-impact exercises are likely to be contraindicated for older adults at high risk of fracture, it is reassuring that few if any adverse effects have been reported from exercise intervention trials that have been conducted in children or in middle-aged or older adults.

### Beat osteoporosis-nourish and exercise skeletons (BONES): a group randomized controlled trial in children [^114K1CG4]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Future considerations

The BONES Project demonstrated that after-school programs may serve as a potential platform for bone-building behavioral interventions for children as others have been successful with health interventions in this environment; however greater intervention intensity may be needed for larger impact. We present a potentially feasible and sustainable model by training large groups of existing after-school program leaders in diverse after-school programs rather than specialist-led initiatives. This platform allows for greater opportunity to make larger-scale environmental modifications, which can improve children's health behavior and health outcomes including peak bone mass. Future investigators employing the BONES framework should consider user-friendliness of evaluation tools given time constraints of the subjects and program. The quantitative ultrasound device did not work well with children with especially small or narrow feet, and children who did not sit still. Therefore, use of the machinery in the field should be considered, and alternative strategies to increase the percent of participants completing these measurements should be explored. Additionally, while the BONES Project increased availability and accessibility to calcium-rich snacks and physical activity equipment, other environmental change strategies, including those at the policy-level, were not targeted. Exploration of these strategies, as well as further research to understand the cost-effectiveness of intervening through an after-school program, particularly when compared to school-based programs, serve as important next steps in understanding best practices of reaching children with health behavior interventions. Lastly, future research is needed to understand interrelated factors that influence bone health and to assess other indices of bone strength, such as the material and structural properties of bone during growing years.

### Targeted exercise against osteoporosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis for optimising bone strength throughout life [^1158WHT9]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Methods

We specify our eligibility criteria, data sources, selection of studies, data extraction, sensitivity, and subgroup analyses a priori. The procedure was conducted according to the Cochrane reviewers' handbook.

Eligibility Criteria

For this meta-analysis, we accepted RCTs with an exercise duration of at least 6 months that used (p)QCT, MRI or DXA HSA to assess whole bone strength. The 6-month follow-up limit was selected because the entire bone remodelling cycle typically takes around 6 months, and thus it is unlikely that any true physiological exercise-induced skeletal changes would occur prior to this period. Examiner blinding or participants' ethnicity were not eligibility requirements. Throughout this paper, we will use a common term 'bone strength' to encompass all specific biomechanical terms of bone strength, such as bone strength index (BSI), stress-strain index (SSI), maximal moment of inertia (Imax), cross-sectional moment of inertia (CSMI) and section moduli (Z). We focused on papers published on the topic in English until October 2009. We included studies from the prepubertal period (≥ 6 to 10 years of age) to older age (≥ 50) and analysed the results by age groups (childhood, adolescence, adulthood and older adulthood) to reduce the clinical heterogeneity since the effects of exercise on bone strength is an age- and maturity- dependent phenomenon. For instance, it is hypothesized that growth is a time when exercise may be associated with a marked increase in bone strength. In contrast, adulthood is a period when exercise may help to maintain bone strength, while exercise in older adulthood is most likely to reduce (or attenuate) the natural decline in bone strength.

We included healthy female and male children, and adult women and men not using anti-osteoporotic medication, unless equally distributed between study arms in a given trial. We excluded quasi RCTs, trials for people with disabilities and all animal experimental studies. Intervention exercise or physical activity trials were defined as weight-bearing impact, resistance, endurance training or a combination of these types of training. Habitual recreational activity without any specific intervention or supervised activity known not to affect bone (sham exercise) was accepted as activity for the control participants.

Bone Strength

Our meta-analysis of published RCTs evaluating exercise effects on bone strength during growth indicate that there was a small but significant effect on the lower extremities in young boys (effect size 0.17; 95% CI, 0.02–0.32), but not in young girls (Figures 2 and 3). Furthermore, when the authors of the original articles conducted per-protocol analyses, which accounted for physiologically meaningful covariates such as weight and height, they reported that weight-bearing exercise can enhance bone strength at the distal tibia in prepubertal but not early pubertal boys. These findings suggest that the response of bone to loading may be maturity-dependent, but further long-term RCTs are still needed to test this hypothesis.

The results of one RCT were excluded from our meta-analysis because the follow-up bone values were not reported in the original article and could not be obtained from the authors. In this RCT that included pre- and early pubertal girls, the authors reported a 4% exercise effect on femoral neck strength in early pubertal girls. However, our meta-analysis including values of the ITT approach did not find statistically significant exercise effects on femoral neck strength in another RCT including postpubertal adolescent boys or girls. In contrast, per-protocol analysis in this study revealed that there was a trend toward a greater improvement among those who were compliant (19% vs. 11%) in both sexes (Figure 4).

### Beat osteoporosis-nourish and exercise skeletons (BONES): a group randomized controlled trial in children [^112ys1oE]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The BONES plus parent component of the intervention demonstrated encouraging bone and physical activity outcomes. Community-based interventions conducted in an after-school program-based setting, coupled with parental engagement present a potentially feasible approach for reaching young children to encourage bone-building behaviors that can prevent the onset of osteoporosis in adulthood. The intensity and duration of the program that is needed to significantly impact bone and behavior (diet and physical activity) changes in both boys and girls is still unknown and is likely greater than was anticipated in the BONES Project. Future research should consider cost-effectiveness when delivering programs with the capability for broad reach.

### Osteoprotective benefits of exercise: more pain, less gain? [^117HqpZo]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2001). Low credibility.

Based on the results of their study, Hagberg et al. suggested that physical activity that is moderate in intensity might be most appropriate for the prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. The take-home message is that being physically active has osteoprotective benefits. However, the implication that more vigorous exercise is less beneficial must be carefully scrutinized. When compared with the physically active nonathletes, the highly trained athletes in this study tended to be more years beyond menopause, had been on HRT for a smaller proportion of the postmenopausal period, and may have had lower endogenous estrogen levels as a result of having less fat mass. The chronic exposure of the skeleton to estrogens very likely played a more prominent role in determining BMD status in the women in this study than the investigators were able to ascertain, owing largely to the cross-sectional nature of the investigation. It is safe to conclude that an exercise prescription for the prevention of osteoporosis should include weight-bearing exercise, but the optimal intensity, frequency, and duration of exercise remain to be established. The results of the study by Hagberg et al. emphasize the importance of physical activity for sustaining BMD, but should not provide a basis for discouraging women from performing vigorous exercise.

### Bone health and osteoporosis [^113BBirU]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue leading to decreased bone strength and an increased risk of low-energy fractures. Central dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry measurements are the gold standard for determining bone mineral density. Bone loss is an inevitable consequence of the decrease in estrogen levels during and following menopause, but additional risk factors for bone loss can also contribute to osteoporosis in older women. A well-balanced diet, exercise, and smoking cessation are key to maintaining bone health as women age. Pharmacologic agents should be recommended in patients at high risk for fracture.

### Exercise for improving outcomes after osteoporotic vertebral fracture [^114vKZ1L]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Vertebral fractures are associated with increased morbidity (e.g., pain, reduced quality of life), and mortality. Therapeutic exercise is a non-pharmacologic conservative treatment that is often recommended for patients with vertebral fractures to reduce pain and restore functional movement.

Objectives

Our objectives were to evaluate the benefits and harms of exercise interventions of four weeks or greater (alone or as part of a physical therapyintervention) versus non-exercise/non-active physical therapy intervention, no intervention or placebo on the incidence of future fractures and adverse events among adults with a history of osteoporotic vertebral fracture(s). We were also examined the effects of exercise on the following secondary outcomes: falls, pain, posture, physical function, balance, mobility, muscle function, quality of life and bone mineral density of the lumbar spine or hip measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). We also reported exercise adherence.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases: The Cochrane Library (Issue 11 of 12, November 2011), MEDLINE (2005 to 2011), EMBASE (1988 to November 23, 2011), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, 1982 to November 23, 2011), AMED (1985 to November 2011), and PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database, www.pedro.fhs.usyd.edu.au/index.html, 1929 to November 23, 2011. Ongoing and recently completed trials were identified by searching the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to December 2009). Conference proceedings were searched via ISI and SCOPUS, and targeted searches of proceedings of the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and American Society for Bone and Mineral Research. Search terms or MeSH headings included terms such as vertebral fracture AND exercise OR physical therapy.

Selection Criteria

We considered all randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials comparing exercise or active physical therapy interventions with placebo/non-exercise/non-active physical therapy interventions or no intervention implemented in individuals with a history of vertebral fracture and evaluating the outcomes of interest.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials and extracted data using a pre-tested data abstraction form. Disagreements were resolved by consensus, or third party adjudication. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias was used to evaluate each study. Studies were grouped according to duration of follow-up (i.e., a) four to 12 weeks; b) 16 to 24 weeks; and c) 52 weeks); a study could be represented in more than one group depending on the number of follow-up assessments. For continuous data, we report mean differences (MDs) of the change or percentage change from baseline. Data from two studies were pooled for one outcome using a fixed-effect model.

Main Results

Seven trials (488 participants, four male participants) were included. Substantial variability across the seven trials prevented any meaningful pooling of data for most outcomes. No trials assessed the effect of exercise on incident fractures, adverse events or incident falls. Individual trials reported that exercise could improve pain, performance on the Timed Up and Go test, walking speed, back extensor strength, trunk muscle endurance, and quality of life. However, the findings should be interpreted with caution given that there were also reports of no significant difference between exercise and control groups for pain, Timed Up and Go test performance, trunk extensor muscle strength and quality of life. Pooled analyses from two studies revealed a significant between-group difference in favour of exercise for Timed Up and Go performance (MD -1.13 seconds, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.85 to -0.42, P = 0.002). Individual studies also reported no significant between-group differences for posture or bone mineral density. Adherence to exercise varied across studies. The risk of bias across all studies was variable; low risk across most domains in four studies, and unclear or high risk in most domains for three studies.

Authors' Conclusions

No definitive conclusions can be made regarding the benefits of exercise for individuals with vertebral fracture. Although individual trials did report benefits for some pain, physical function and quality of life outcomes, the findings should be interpreted with caution given that findings were inconsistent and the quality of evidence was very low. The small number of trials and variability across trials limited our ability to pool outcomes or make conclusions. Evidence regarding the effects of exercise after vertebral fracture, particularly for men, is scarce. A high-quality randomized trial is needed to inform exercise prescription for individuals with vertebral fractures.

### Physical activity and skeletal health in adults [^113i2mbr]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

The purpose of this Review is to examine the associations between physical activity and skeletal health, with an emphasis on observational studies with fracture outcomes and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of physical activity interventions in adults older than 40 years. In general, increased physical activity-primarily leisure time activity or moderate or vigorous physical activity-is associated with a 1–40% lower risk of hip and all fractures. The primary limitation of these studies relates to health status; healthy people are more likely to exercise and less likely to fracture. Although there is no sufficiently powered RCT of exercise with a fracture outcome, there is evidence that some types of exercise prevent falls and bone loss, and meta-analyses support the anti-fracture effectiveness of exercise. RCTs and meta-analyses suggest that programmes combining impact exercise with moderate or high-intensity progressive resistance exercise might maintain or improve bone mass and prevent fractures, and that functional strength and balance training prevents falls.

### Resistance training over 2 years increases bone mass in calcium-replete postmenopausal women [^113m7nFv]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2001). Low credibility.

Understanding the stress/strain relationship between exercise and bone is critical to understanding the potential benefit of exercise in preventing postmenopausal bone loss. This study examined the effect of a 2-year exercise intervention and calcium supplementation (600 mg) on bone mineral density (BMD) in 126 postmenopausal women (mean age, 60 ± 5 years). Assignment was by block randomization to one of three groups: strength (S), fitness (F), or nonexercise control (C). The two exercise groups completed three sets of the same nine exercises, three times a week. The S group increased the loading, while the F group had additional stationary bicycle riding with minimal increase in loading. Retention at 2 years was 71% (59% in the S group, 69% in the F group, and 83% in the C group), while the exercise compliance did not differ between the exercise groups (S group, 74 ± 13%; F group, 77 ± 14%). BMD was measured at the hip, lumbar spine, and forearm sites every 6 months using a Hologic 4500. Whole body BMD also was measured every 6 months on a Hologic 2000. There was no difference between the groups at the forearm, lumbar spine, or whole body sites. There was a significant effect of the strength program at the total (0.9 ± 2.6%; p < 0.05) and intertrochanter hip site (1.1 ± 3.0%; p < 0.01). There was a significant time and group interaction (p < 0.05) at the intertrochanter site by repeated measures. This study shows the effectiveness of a progressive strength program in increasing bone density at the clinically important hip site. We concluded that a strength program could be recommended as an adjunct lifestyle approach to osteoporosis treatment or used in combination with other therapies.

### Recommendations for improving women's bone health throughout the lifespan [^115qjVJ4]. Journal of Women's Health (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Promoting early education and a bone healthy lifestyle

Clinical care for osteoporosis typically occurs late in adult life, as bone mineral density (BMD) naturally decreases and risk for fracture increases substantially with age. However, there is value in starting conversations and encouraging individuals to adopt proactive measures to build bone and reduce risk for fracture much earlier in life, especially while bones are still developing.

Adolescence is a critical period for bone mineral accrual, as 40%–60% of adult PBM is accrued during the adolescent years. It is estimated that a 10% increase in the PBM of children and adolescents can reduce the risk of an osteoporotic fracture during adulthood by 50%. In women, the rate of bone accrual peaks in early adolescence (11–14 years old), though bones slowly continue to build in the years immediately following, until PBM is achieved in young adulthood (25–35 years old). Preventive measures initiated during childhood and adolescence when bone mass is still being accrued can have lifelong benefits.

Diet and exercise are two established ways to increase, maintain, and support BMD throughout the lifespan, while also mitigating fall and fracture risk. Calcium plays a critical role in building and maintaining healthy bone, and vitamin D facilitates proper absorption of calcium. Although both are available as supplements, dietary intake is the preferred way to satisfy the daily consumption recommendations. Dairy products have a particularly high calcium content and are invaluable to a calcium-rich diet. However, it is difficult to achieve sufficient circulating levels of vitamin D from diet alone.

Thus, the National Academy of Medicine recommends, and clinical societies that engage bone health also endorse, vitamin D supplementation for all children, adolescents, and young adults. Since the release of this recommendation in 2010, investigations continue to elucidate associations between vitamin D and bone health outcomes.

### Strong, steady and straight: UK consensus statement on physical activity and exercise for osteoporosis [^115inAex]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

People with vertebral fractures or multiple low trauma fractures, will have greater general bone fragility and a higher risk of further fracture. The expert group consensus was more cautious about moderate impact exercise in these people. A discussion about personal preferences and concerns is recommended to aid decisions about amending or excluding specific leisure or sports activities. An individualised progressive tailoring of intensity of both impact and muscle-strengthening exercise, under supervision, would often be appropriate. Gradually increasing impact up to 'moderate' could be appropriate depending on the number of vertebral fractures and symptoms experienced; other medical conditions, level of fitness or previous experience of moderate impact activity before the vertebral fracture need to be considered.

When starting an impact or muscle-strengthening programme, factors including general fitness, previous exercise and comorbidities should be considered in everyone. Building up gradually, employing good technique, and monitoring both progress and any adverse effects, is the best approach. Urinary incontinence may be a barrier to impact exercise so addressing stress incontinence may be a necessary step to being able to implement such an exercise programme. Learning best possible posture and correct technique is recommended as part of any progressive muscle resistance training. Balance and muscle strength training will be important for those at risk of falling before increasing to activities such as brisk walking.

Some sports and leisure activities involve an inherent risk of injurious impact, falling and fracture, such as contact sports, horse riding and skiing. However, for those who practice these regularly, the benefits provided by the activity, including enjoyment and benefits to muscle and bone strength, are likely to outweigh the risks unless people have had multiple fragility fractures or painful spinal fractures. People with osteoporosis may need some reassurance to continue with activities they enjoy.

### Beat osteoporosis-nourish and exercise skeletons (BONES): a group randomized controlled trial in children [^115SR4od]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Findings from the BONES Project support and build upon prior interventions in both reach and intervention design. By expanding on the school-based model and intervening through an after-school program platform, the BONES Project delivered a three-component curriculum – diet, physical activity, and education – to a larger, ethnically diverse, sample of both boys and girls who were younger than in other intervention trials. The benefits and importance of bone-strengthening interventions for children at younger ages are well demonstrated.

While community-based approaches are common practices for behavior change interventions targeting children, outcomes have been mixed with respect to increases in bone-strengthening behaviors and bone quality; only two had statistically significant increases in total bone area. Although Daley et al. measured physical activity habits and calcium intake, no improvements were observed in either outcome. Neither of the bone-building interventions observed an increase in physical activity metrics and only the one focused on 14–16 year old girls saw an increase in BMD of the Spine and Trochanter. The BONES Project likewise did not find significant improvements in the majority of outcomes. Calcium rich food knowledge for all children improved, although not differentially by intervention assignment. We also did not observe significant increases in calcium intake for either sex. A significant increase in physical activity levels was observed for boys in both intervention groups and all children in B + P compared to controls, but not for girls alone. Additionally, though a statistically significant increase in bone stiffness was not detected, a pooled analysis of both intervention arms revealed that for girls participating in the intervention, the mean change in stiffness was an increase of 2.08 units per year, compared to a drop of 0.58 units-per year for the control (p = 0.08). Such an effect could be practically important and may merit further investigation.

### Brief, low-impact, high-intensity osteogenic loading in postmenopausal osteoporosis: a quasi-experimental case-series study [^116JrQQh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the plethora of drugs used to treat and/or delay osteoporosis, very few nonpharmaceutical methods have been tested and even fewer have succeeded. Until recently, the treatment of osteoporosis in the setting of bone fractures, especially those at the lumbar spine level, consisted of pharmacotherapy, surgery, and the avoidance of everyday exercise, with controversial results. The literature describes nonpharmaceutical methods to reduce fracture risk due to osteoporosis as traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine. Patients often use these methods without informing their physicians, making it even more difficult to evaluate the possible protective effects of these practices against osteoporosis. Among these proposed methods, supplementation of calcium and vitamin D, along with exercise, remain the most often recommended modality for osteoporosis prevention according to worldwide clinical practice guidelines, although specific parameters of exercise have not been defined.

There is substantial patient interest in nonpharmacologic approaches to treating or preventing osteoporosis, and Osteostrong ® is one such intervention, whose efficiency, however, has not been evaluated in clinical trials yet. Interestingly, suggestions for exercise to strengthen the musculoskeletal system and to increase balance have been provided in recent treatment guidelines for osteoporosis and fracture prevention, without specific instructions for the duration, extension, type of exercise, and other important parameters.

Osteogenic loading is based on Wolff's law suggesting that a healthy animal's bone will adjust to the forces applied to it. The internal structure of trabeculae experiences adaptive alterations, which are subsequently followed by secondary adjustments to the external cortical part of the bone, processes that could result in the thickening of the bone. Conversely, when the load on a bone is reduced, the bone experiences a decrease in density and strength due to the absence of the necessary stimulus required for continuous remodeling. Osteostrong ®, a brief, low-impact, high-intensity osteogenic loading training modality with once-weekly, 10-minute sessions, using patented devices, known as "Spectrum", is described here. Although several people have used the Osteostrong ® intervention with reportedly beneficial effects on bone density, the method has been less studied for its efficacy in improving bone density and quality in subjects with osteopenia or osteoporosis. The aim of this prospective quasi-experimental case-series study was to assess changes in BMD and TBS in the lumbar spine and/or hip over 12 months in peri-/postmenopausal women with osteoporosis following Osteostrong ® intervention, and to compare these outcomes with those in women who did not receive the intervention.

### Role of exercise in preventing and treating osteoporosis [^112hAsCJ]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Bone mass at any time of life reflects the totality of events that have impinged on the skeleton to that point. For adults, these events include those that have influenced the acquisition of bone during years of growth, resulting in the achievement of skeletal maturity, or "peak bone mass", as well as those that have subsequently influenced bone losses. For each limb of this trajectory, physical activity has been implicated as a powerful and independent factor. This article reviews current evidence regarding the relation of habitual physical activity to bone acquisition and maintenance, the skeletal consequences of exercise training, and the clinical value of exercise for patients with skeletal frailty.

Fundamental measures for bone health — lifestyle and nonpharmacologic strategies emphasize nutrition, exercise, fall-risk reduction, and functional training. "Several lifestyle modifications may improve musculoskeletal integrity and balance, preserve bone strength, and prevent future fractures". These include "adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D; lifelong participation in regular, weight-bearing, resistance, and balance-improving exercises to minimize falls; avoiding use of tobacco and excessive use of alcohol; and elimination of potential risk factors for falling". This "bone healthy" lifestyle is "important for everyone", and "Patients with osteoporosis may benefit from physical therapy or other activities and other nonpharmacologic measures to improve strength and reduce the risk of falls and fractures". Goals include "Optimize skeletal development and maximize peak bone mass at skeletal maturity; Maintain skeletal mass and prevent age-related bone loss; Preserve the structural integrity of the skeleton; Prevent falls and fractures".

### Mechanical stimuli and bone health: what is the evidence? [^114JcEMG]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

With the recent emergence of associations of bisphosphonate therapy with atypical fractures and osteonecrosis of the jaw, there is renewed interest among clinicians and patients for nonpharmacological approaches to bone health. Here, we review the new studies published in the past year or two that advance our knowledge of the effect of mechanical stimuli on bone health.

Recent Findings

Physical activity is associated with serum sclerostin levels; the most physically active individuals have the lowest serum sclerostin levels. Observational trials suggest that physical activity participation results in higher bone mass, but clinical trials suggest that the effects of exercise on areal bone mineral density are small, and vary with the site measured and the type of exercise. Based on current data, it may be best to combine progressive resistance training with interventions such as walking or aerobic dancing if the desire is to improve both spine and hip in postmenopausal women. Low-magnitude high-frequency whole body vibration does not improve bone mineral density and bone structure in postmenopausal women.

Summary

Physical activity and exercise are important for the maintenance of musculoskeletal health as we age. Future studies need to investigate the effects of exercise in older populations with rheumatological diseases and those with a history of fragility fractures.

### Strong, steady and straight: UK consensus statement on physical activity and exercise for osteoporosis [^115J5ao2]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Implementation

This consensus statement provides clear consistent advice for people living with osteoporosis and health professionals working with them about the evidence for, and safety of, exercise (see online supplemental appendix VI for further UK-specific guidance), supported by resources. To ensure effective implementation of the strong, steady and straight exercise approaches, the factors that act as both facilitators and barriers to implementation need consideration. These include appropriate and timely identification and management of people living with osteoporosis by primary and secondary care providers; provision of exercise interventions that conform to evidence-based requirements and the complexity of providing multiple exercise programmes for different long-term conditions in the context of limited resources; and uptake and adherence to exercise interventions (short-term and long-term). Osteoporosis exercise programmes, like other exercise programmes for older people and those with long-term conditions, need to be more than a prescribed set of exercises. They need to consider education and physical literacy, support and goal setting, motivation strategies, behaviour change techniques and take into consideration needs and preferences. For effective implementation of the strong, steady and straight exercise approaches an infrastructure for measuring and monitoring quality assurance and improvement is needed, to ensure ongoing fidelity (the right populations targeted by the right professionals, dose, frequency, intensity, challenge, resistance, etc.). We need to demonstrate impact to justify investment in osteoporosis programmes. This is increasingly important as the impact of COVID-19 and increased prevention and rehabilitation needs have the potential to jeopardise the offer of exercise for osteoporosis.

### Targeted exercise against osteoporosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis for optimising bone strength throughout life [^112YyT1F]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

In older adults, the results from cross-sectional studies indicate that exercise can enhance cortical thickness and bone strength at loaded sites, which appears to be largely due to an increase in the cross-sectional size of the bone (periosteal apposition). However, these findings are not supported by the limited data from exercise intervention trials. In an early non-RCT using pQCT to assess bone geometric changes at the radius in response to a 6-month upper limb loading program in postmenopausal women, Adami et al. reported a significant training effect on cortical bone area (3%) and cortical BMC (3%), but a decrease in trabecular BMC (-3%). The authors speculated that increased loading resulted in reshaping of the bone cross-section (periosteal expansion) and a redistribution of bone minerals from the trabecular to cortical component (e.g. corticalisation of the trabecular tissue). Similarly, the findings from a 12-month multidirectional jumping intervention in postmenopausal women revealed that exercise seemed to improve bone strength at the distal tibia by increasing the ratio of cortical to total area. There was no effect of exercise on total area, which suggests that exercise reduced endocortical bone loss.

Safety of exercise in people with osteoporosis or fragility fractures

Information from three sources was reported: observational and case studies reporting circumstances of osteoporotic fracture; reports of exercise interventions in people with osteoporosis; adverse event reporting from exercise interventions to increase bone strength and to reduce falls risk.

A few case studies described instances of vertebral fractures during horse riding or during a golfing mid-swing stroke. However, the majority of observational or non-randomised studies in people with osteoporosis did not report adverse events, apart from muscle soreness and joint discomfort. There were some reports of vertebral fractures associated with end-range, sustained, repeated or loaded flexion exercises, including sit-upsand some yoga positions involving extreme spinal flexion. One study reported fractures associated with rolling from prone to supine and dropping a weight on a foot.

In exercise interventions designed to increase BMD, many studies did not report whether there were adverse events. Of 62 trials, 11 reported fracturesover the course of the studies but rarely due to the intervention itself. Overall, 5.8% of intervention group participants sustained fractures compared with 9.6% of control group participants. In particular, there was no evidence of symptomatic vertebral fracture in association with impact exercise or moderate to high-intensity muscle-strengthening exercise. Closely supervised high-intensity resistance and impact training in osteoporotic men and women was associated with few adverse effects and no vertebral fractures. In a further study of strength, balance and daily moderate to vigorous physical activity in people with osteoporosis, adverse events (both falls and fractures) did not differ significantly between the control and the intervention groups. These trials demonstrate that exercise can be conducted even in those who already have osteoporosis.

In studies on exercise for fall prevention, only 27 out of 108 trials reported adverse events and only one study reported a (pelvic stress) fracture. There is some evidence that brisk walking increased fracture risk in a population already at risk of falls and fracture, who may therefore require strength and balance exercise to improve stability before embarking on brisk walking or fatiguing exercise.

Overall, there is little evidence of harm, including fractures, occurring while exercising. Furthermore, cases that were identified comprised a mixture of people with and without osteoporosis (as defined by DXA). Exercise is therefore unlikely to cause a fracture (and specifically a vertebral fracture) and does not need to be adapted for those with osteoporosis according to fracture risk or low BMD (including osteoporosis or osteopenia determined by DXA).

Data Synthesis

In the data synthesis of the meta-analysis, Review Manager software (5.0.16; Thomson ResearchSoft, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used to calculate the pooled effect estimates for the combinations of single effects of RCTs using an ITT approach if possible. ITT data were replaced with per-protocol data in cases where ITT data were not available. To calculate standardized mean differences (effect size), we used the follow-up values of bone strength measures adjusted for baseline bone values. An effect size around 0.2 was considered a small effect, around 0.5 a medium effect and ≥ 0.8 a large effect. For all analyses, we used an inverse variance weighted random effects model that incorporates heterogeneity into the model. In multiple comparisons with two or more exercise groups, the number of controls was divided among comparisons to ensure that we counted control participants only once in the meta-analysis. Results were considered to be statistically significant at an alpha level of < 0.05. Heterogeneity was calculated using the Cochran's Q-test and an alpha level of < 0.10 for statistical significance. In addition, I 2 was used to examine inconsistency in the study findings. In general, values of < 25%, 25%-50%, 50%-75% and > 75% were suggestive of low, moderate, high and very high inconsistency.

In the results section of this systematic review and meta-analysis, we present our findings from meta-analysis using forest plots of the standardized mean differences for children and adolescents, young adults, and older adults. We then discuss and summarize the findings in the discussion section. In the final two sections of this review, we discuss the structural basis underlying exercise-induced improvements in bone strength, as well as the characteristics of exercise loading that have been shown to be best associated with structural improvements in bone. For these two sections, pertinent cross-sectional studies were reviewed.

Exercise and proper body mechanics — Weight-bearing and resistance exercise can improve agility, strength, posture, and balance, which may reduce the risk of falls, and exercise may modestly increase bone density. AACE strongly endorses lifelong physical activity for cardiovascular health, osteoporosis prevention, and overall health. Weight-bearing exercise includes walking, jogging, Tai Chi, stair climbing, and dancing, while muscle-strengthening exercise includes weight training and other resistive exercises. Before initiating an exercise program in an individual with osteoporosis, a clinician's evaluation is recommended.

### Targeted exercise against osteoporosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis for optimising bone strength throughout life [^116qERAC]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Even though we did not exclude articles that may have been biased from our meta-analysis because of the limited number of available RCTs on this topic, the quality evaluation of individual studies revealed several possibilities for systematic bias (Table 2). The major concerns were that 3 of the 10 analysed RCTs were < 12 months in duration, and 4 included < 100 participants. Moreover, the prescribed type and amount of weekly exercise varied considerably between the different trials. One trial also reported findings on the basis of a per-protocol approach rather than ITT. In addition, some studies included small (albeit not statistically significant) between-group differences in baseline outcome variables despite the randomization. However, we used baseline-adjusted values in our meta-analysis to control for this possible bias. Also, outcome variables describing structural strength varied between the studies, and comparisons were made with controls continuing their habitual activity rather than offering them nonosteogenic (sham) exercise interventions. Other minor concerns were related to the lack of details comparing participants who declined to participate and those who participated in some trials.

Effects of exercise on bone strength in children and adolescents

BMD

Over the past two decades, there have been a number of well-designed exercise RCTs conducted over a period of 6–24 months in prepubertal children and adolescents with BMD as the primary endpoint as reported in a recent review. These studies have shown that exercise programmes incorporating a diverse range of weight-bearing activities can enhance BMC or BMD at loaded skeletal sites such as the femur. A recent systematic review of these randomised and nonrandomised controlled trials indicated that the exercise-induced skeletal gains over 6 months at the femoral neck and lumbar spine ranged from 1% to 6% before puberty and from 0.3% to 2% during adolescence.

### Combating osteoporosis and obesity with exercise: leveraging cell mechanosensitivity [^114ydpa3]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2019). High credibility.

Osteoporosis, a condition of skeletal decline that undermines quality of life, is treated with pharmacological interventions that are associated with poor adherence and adverse effects. Complicating efforts to improve clinical outcomes, the incidence of obesity is increasing, predisposing the population to a range of musculoskeletal complications and metabolic disorders. Pharmacological management of obesity has yet to deliver notable reductions in weight and debilitating complications are rarely avoided. By contrast, exercise shows promise as a non-invasive and non-pharmacological method of regulating both osteoporosis and obesity. The principal components of exercise - mechanical signals - promote bone and muscle anabolism while limiting formation and expansion of fat mass. Mechanical regulation of bone and marrow fat might be achieved by regulating functions of differentiated cells in the skeletal tissue while biasing lineage selection of their common progenitors - mesenchymal stem cells. An inverse relationship between adipocyte versus osteoblast fate selection from stem cells is implicated in clinical conditions such as childhood obesity and increased marrow adiposity in type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as contributing to skeletal frailty. Understanding how exercise-induced mechanical signals can be used to improve bone quality while decreasing fat mass and metabolic dysfunction should lead to new strategies to treat chronic diseases such as osteoporosis and obesity.

### Osteoporosis prevention, diagnosis, and therapy [^111Yb22R]. JAMA (2001). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To clarify the factors associated with prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of osteoporosis, and to present the most recent information available in these areas.

Participants

From March 27–29, 2000, a nonfederal, nonadvocate, 13-member panel was convened, representing the fields of internal medicine, family and community medicine, endocrinology, epidemiology, orthopedic surgery, gerontology, rheumatology, obstetrics and gynecology, preventive medicine, and cell biology. Thirty-two experts from these fields presented data to the panel and an audience of 699. Primary sponsors were the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases and the National Institutes of Health Office of Medical Applications of Research.

Evidence

MEDLINE was searched for January 1995 through December 1999, and a bibliography of 2449 references provided to the panel. Experts prepared abstracts for presentations with relevant literature citations. Scientific evidence was given precedence over anecdotal experience.

Consensus Process

The panel, answering predefined questions, developed conclusions based on evidence presented in open forum and the literature. The panel composed a draft statement, which was read and circulated to the experts and the audience for public discussion. The panel resolved conflicts and released a revised statement at the end of the conference. The draft statement was posted on the Web on March 30, 2000, and updated with the panel's final revisions within a few weeks.

Conclusions

Though prevalent in white postmenopausal women, osteoporosis occurs in all populations and at all ages and has significant physical, psychosocial, and financial consequences. Risks for osteoporosis (reflected by low bone mineral density [BMD]) and for fracture overlap but are not identical. More attention should be paid to skeletal health in persons with conditions associated with secondary osteoporosis. Clinical risk factors have an important but poorly validated role in determining who should have BMD measurement, in assessing fracture risk, and in determining who should be treated. Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake is crucial to develop optimal peak bone mass and to preserve bone mass throughout life. Supplementation with these 2 nutrients may be necessary in persons not achieving recommended dietary intake. Gonadal steroids are important determinants of peak and lifetime bone mass in men, women, and children. Regular exercise, especially resistance and high-impact activities, contributes to development of high peak bone mass and may reduce risk of falls in older persons. Assessment of bone mass, identification of fracture risk, and determination of who should be treated are the optimal goals when evaluating patients for osteoporosis. Fracture prevention is the primary treatment goal for patients with osteoporosis. Several treatments have been shown to reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures, including those that enhance bone mass and reduce the risk or consequences of falls. Adults with vertebral, rib, hip, or distal forearm fractures should be evaluated for osteoporosis and given appropriate therapy.

### Strong, steady and straight: UK consensus statement on physical activity and exercise for osteoporosis [^114xa9RD]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

It is estimated that 137 million women and 21 million men have high osteoporotic fracture risk globally, with this prevalence expected to double in the next 40 years. Fractures of the hip and spine can lead to loss of independence, disability and reduced life expectancy. Vertebral fractures are associated with long-term pain and other physical and psychological symptoms, whereas hip fractures are associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

Current approaches to reduce fracture incidence include identifying people with significant fracture risk and prescribing pharmaceutical treatment, using education and support to promote adherence to medication, and developing falls prevention strategies especially for those who are older and frailer. Additional preventive strategies include healthy eating with adequate calcium and vitamin D, not smoking or consuming excessive alcohol and being physically active in adolescence and young adulthood to maximise peak bone mass.

Epidemiological and intervention studies provide evidence of a strong relationship between physical activity, exercise and bone health, with regular exercisers having a lower incidence of fracture. Exercise can both increase bone mineral density (BMD) and reduce falls risk. However, there is still uncertainty about whether increasing volume and intensity of exercise, especially in later life or when bone strength is compromised, will improve bone strength, and importantly, what type or intensity of exercise intervention is most beneficial.

Osteoporotic fractures may be precipitated by a fall or with loading during activity. People with osteoporosis and health professionals are thus concerned that physical activity could increase fracture risk, although evidence to support these concerns is limited. Uncertainty persists about what is appropriate and safe in people with, or at risk of, osteoporosis, and may be accompanied by concerns about liability. As a result, people significantly reduce activity levels, limiting both function and enjoyment. This may have important adverse implications for their bone health, falls and future fracture risk.

### Targeted exercise against osteoporosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis for optimising bone strength throughout life [^117UsSKM]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Although exercise is widely recommended as one of the key preventative strategies to reduce the risk of osteoporosis, falls and fractures, its effects on bone have remained controversial because its potential for improving whole bone strength has not yet been properly assessed. However, advances in noninvasive bone imaging techniques, such as peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) have made such an evaluation possible. Therefore, the primary objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to provide an update on the current knowledge regarding the effects of exercise on estimates of whole bone strength throughout the lifespan. Specifically, we analysed the exercise findings by age groups (childhood, adolescence, young adulthood and older adulthood) and compared the exercise-induced changes to habitually active or sedentary controls. We assessed randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which exercise duration was 6 months or more and 'bone strength' was estimated from quantitative computed tomography (QCT), pQCT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or DXA-based hip structural analysis (HSA).

The secondary aim was to generate new research hypotheses by discussing the structural basis underlying exercise-induced improvements in bone strength, as well as the characteristics of loading that have been shown to be best associated with structural improvements in bone.

In the first section of this systematic review and meta-analysis, we briefly discuss the key findings from previous intervention trials and meta-analyses that have evaluated the effects of exercise on conventional DXA-measured BMD. We then present the findings from our own meta-analysis on the basis of exercise RCTs measuring bone strength as an outcome.

### Does exercise influence pediatric bone? A systematic review [^1153FsSU]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Periods of growth are thought to be the best time to increase bone mineral content, bone area, and areal bone mineral density (aBMD) through increased loading owing to high rates of bone modeling and remodeling. However, questions remain regarding whether a benefit of exercise is seen at all bone sites, is dependent on pubertal status or sex of the child, or whether other factors such as diet modify the response to exercise.

Questions/Purposes

We asked: (1) Does bone-loading exercise in childhood consistently increase bone mineral content, bone area, or aBMD? (2) Do effects of exercise differ depending on pubertal status or sex? (3) Does calcium intake modify the bone response to exercise?

Methods

A literature search identified 22 unique trials for inclusion in this meta-analysis of the effect of exercise on bone changes by bone site, pubertal status, and sex. Sample sizes ranged from 16 to 410 subjects 3 to 18 years old with length of intervention ranging from 3 to 36 months. Fifteen of 22 trials were randomized (child randomized in nine, classroom/school randomized in six) and seven were observational trials. Ten trials were Level 2 and 11 were Level 3 based on the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine criteria. Random effects models tested the difference (intervention mean effect-control mean effect) in percent change in bone mineral content, bone area, and aBMD. Meta-regression was used to identify sources of heterogeneity and funnel plots were used to assess publication bias.

Results

Children assigned to exercise had greater mean percent changes in bone mineral content and aBMD than children assigned to the control groups. Mean differences (95% CI) in bone mineral content percent change between intervention and control groups at total body (0.8; 95% CI, 0.3–1.3; p = 0.003), femoral neck (1.5; 95% CI, 0.5–2.5; p = 0.003), and spine (1.7; 95% CI, 0.4–3.1; p = 0.01) were significant with no differences in bone area (all p > 0.05). There were greater percent changes in aBMD in intervention than control groups at the femoral neck (0.6; 95% CI, 0.2–1.1; p = 0.006) and spine (1.2; 95% CI, 0.6–1.8; p < 0.001). Benefit of exercise was limited to children who were prepubertal (bone mineral content: total body [0.9; 95% CI, 0.2–1.7; p = 0.01], femoral neck [1.8; 95% CI, 0.0–3.5; p = 0.047], spine [3.7; 95% CI, 0.8–6.6; p = 0.01], and aBMD: femoral neck [0.6; 95% CI, -0.1–1.2; p = 0.07], spine [1.5; 95% CI, 0.7–2.3; p < 0.001]), with no differences among children who were pubertal (all p > 0.05). Changes in aBMD did not differ by sex (all p > 0.05), although the number of studies providing male-specific results was small (six of 22 eligible studies included boys). There was significant heterogeneity in bone mineral content and bone area for which a source could not be identified. Heterogeneity in spine aBMD was reduced by including calcium intake and intervention length as covariates. Three trials designed to determine whether calcium intake modified the bone response to exercise all reported a greater effect of exercise on leg bone mineral content in children randomized to receive supplemental calcium than those receiving placebo.

Conclusions

Exercise interventions during childhood led to 0.6% to 1.7% greater annual increase in bone accrual, with effects predominantly among children who were prepubertal. If this effect were to persist into adulthood, it would have substantial implications for osteoporosis prevention. It is important to identify sources of heterogeneity among studies to determine factors that might influence the bone response to increased exercise during growth.

### Beat osteoporosis-nourish and exercise skeletons (BONES): a group randomized controlled trial in children [^113HPUeM]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The BONES Project demonstrated that a community-based intervention among early elementary school children is feasible to implement in diverse, low-income after-school programs. The intervention was effective at improving some bone health behaviors as revealed by findings that children in B + P and boys in both intervention arms (B and B + P) showed statistical improvement in their reported physical activity behaviors. In addition, boys in B had an increase, albeit non-significant, in vertical jump. There was also an increase in bone stiffness compared to controls in the B + P group. These relatively modest, yet encouraging findings in bone stiffness may be attributed to the younger age of children in the BONES Project (6- to 9-yrs) compared to previous bone-building interventions showing improvement. In addition, factors associated with the after-school program setting such as high staff-turnover, time-constraints, and day-to-day variations in child and staff attendance, could have impacted the dose and quality of the intervention. Although there was a positive increase in percent body fat in all groups, except boys in C, this is unlikely to be clinically meaningful given pre-pubescence and a non-significant difference in BMI z-score. Together, the outcomes are encouraging for sustained work in after-school programs to serve as health intervention platforms during early childhood.

Previous interventions targeting bone-building behaviors and osteoporosis prevention in children have focused on schools as a predominant intervention platform with only a few focusing on the after-school program setting. Examples include Daley et al.'s Specialist-led, school Physical Education-based, intervention for 8-year old boys and girls; the CAPO Kids Trial – a school-based randomized controlled, high intensity interval trial, to enhance bone and reduce fat in girls, ages 10-to-11; and Meyer et al.'s classroom-based intervention to improve bone BMC and BMD in 1st and 5th grade boys and girls, among others. While interventions focused outside of the school environment have incorporated other aspects of bone health including calcium intake and knowledge of bone-building behaviors, these have been largely focused on girls (e.g. Girl Scout meetings and online health behavior change programs for girls).

### Targeted exercise against osteoporosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis for optimising bone strength throughout life [^111SHp5a]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Methodological quality was assessed on the basis of individual trial characteristics using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool (Tables 1 and 2). In general, we concentrated on the following issues: 1) sequence generation, 2) allocation concealment, 3) blinding to group assignment, 4) incomplete outcome data, 5) selective outcome reporting, and 6) other potential sources of systematic bias. Specifically, we were interested in whether randomization was accomplished according to the guidelines (items 1 and 2). Moreover, since bone strength measures can be classified as objective outcomes, we evaluated whether optimal blinding was used to avoid control participants' enthusiasm in increasing their exercise level or whether clear contamination existed between exercisers and controls (item 3). The optimal blinding in children was defined as school rather than individual pupil randomization. In adults and older adults, sham exercise (exercise not affecting bone) rather than normal daily activity was defined as optimal blinding to group assignment. We also evaluated whether intention-to-treat (ITT) rather than a per-protocol approach was used in analyzing the data of original articles, as the issues related to participant withdrawals and possible outliers in measurements (item 4). Likewise, we checked the selective outcome reporting of specific results (item 5). Finally, we evaluated all other potential risk of bias, including whether possible imbalances between baseline variables were considered, exercise dose was adequate (at least three times per week), the sample size was large enough (at least 100 participants) and the follow-up time was long enough (12 months or more) to detect an osteogenic response. In addition, we were interested in whether exercise regimens were similar or heterogeneous between the trials. Each item was classified as low risk if the definition of high quality was fulfilled, high risk if the definition was not fulfilled, and unclear if the information was not available in the original article or it was not obtained from the authors. In cases of possible disagreement between the reviewers, all authors reevaluated the article, and a joint decision was made.

### An update on glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis [^113Xyshd]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

In general, bone loss from glucocorticoid treatment occurs rapidly within the first 6 months of therapy. Glucocorticoids alter bone metabolism by multiple pathways; however, the bone loss is greatest in areas rich in trabecular bone. Preventive measures should be initiated early. It is the author's opinion that all subjects initiating treatment with prednisone at 7.5 mg or greater require calcium supplementation (diet plus supplement) at a dose of 1500 mg and vitamin D at a dose of 400 to 800 IU/d. If the patient is going to remain on this dose of glucocorticoid for more than 4 weeks, an antiresorptive agent should be started (e.g., estrogen, bisphosphonate, raloxifene). If a patient has established osteoporosis and is either initiating glucocorticoid therapy or is chronically treated with prednisone at 5 mg d or greater in addition to calcium and vitamin D supplementation, a potent antiresorptive agent (bisphosphonate) should be started. A bone mineral density measurement of either the lumbar spine or the hip may be helpful is assessing an individual's risk of osteoporosis, may improve compliance with treatment, and can be used to monitor the efficacy of the prescribed therapy. There is no reason to withhold treatment for glucocorticoid-induced bone loss until a bone mass measurement is taken, however. In motivated patients, a weight-bearing and resistance exercise program should be prescribed to help retain muscle strength and prevent depression. If hypercalciuria develops with glucocorticoid use, either thiazide diuretics or sodium restriction may be helpful. In patients who continue to lose bone or experience fracture's despite antiresorptive therapy while on glucocorticoids, bone-building anabolic agents (e.g., hPTH 1–34 or PTH 1–84) may be available someday soon.

### Targeted exercise against osteoporosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis for optimising bone strength throughout life [^116ns3Sx]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

Despite the well-established benefits of exercise on clinically relevant measures of DXA BMC and BMD, the findings from this systematic review and meta-analysis highlight that there is a need for further well-designed, long-term and adequately powered RCTs before any definitive conclusion can be drawn about the effects of exercise on bone strength. When interpreting the exercise effects on bone strength in children, adolescents and premenopausal women from our meta-analysis, it is important to acknowledge that several of the published papers in each age category were based on data from the same RCTs. Nevertheless, the findings from our meta-analysis of RCTs indicate that there is a small but significant beneficial effect of weight-bearing impact exercise on various estimates of bone strength in young boys at loaded skeletal sites. Furthermore, inspection of the results from the original articles based on the authors' per-protocol analyses indicated that the greatest exercise effect on bone strength tended to occur in prepubertal boys. There was also some evidence for a beneficial effect in adolescent boys and girls who were most compliant with training. Similarly, in middle-aged and older adults, we did not find any significant exercise effects on bone strength, which may partly be explained by the short duration and inadequate power of the few published trials. However, the authors' subgroup analysis again indicated a small effect for premenopausal women who were most compliant with the exercise program.

A recent trial investigating exercise effects on BMD reported that small 1%-2% differences in BMD, together with other exercise benefits such as improved muscle function and balance, may reduce fracture incidence by up to 50%. Bone strength is a theoretically meaningful measure of a bone's resistance to fractures. However, measuring bone strength still includes many technical challenges to overcome before it could challenge clinically used DXA BMD and therefore reliably predict fractures. In addition, considering that the precision of pQCT, QCT, MRI, and DXA-related HSA is typically around 2%-3% for estimating bone strength, it is likely that long-term exercise trials (at least 24 months) are needed to accurately quantify the effects of exercise on whole bone strength. Moreover, scanning of bone cross-sections includes other challenges such as defining comparable measurement locations, particularly when performing repeated measures in growing children.

### Calcium and vitamin D for increasing bone mineral density in premenopausal women [^117H7nUi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Osteoporosis is a condition where bones become fragile due to low bone density and impaired bone quality. This results in fractures that lead to higher morbidity and reduced quality of life. Osteoporosis is considered a major public health concern worldwide. For this reason, preventive measurements need to be addressed throughout the life course. Exercise and a healthy diet are among the lifestyle factors that can help prevent the disease, the latter including intake of key micronutrients for bone, such as calcium and vitamin D. The evidence on whether supplementation with calcium and vitamin D improves bone mineral density (BMD) in premenopausal women is still inconclusive. In this age group, bone accrual is considered to be the goal of supplementation, so BMD is relevant for the future stages of life.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of calcium and vitamin D supplementation, alone or in combination, to increase the BMD, reduce fractures, and report the potential adverse events in healthy premenopausal women compared to placebo.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search was 12 April 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials in healthy premenopausal women (with or without calcium or vitamin D deficiency) comparing supplementation of calcium or vitamin D (or both) at any dose and by any route of administration versus placebo for at least three months. Vitamin D could have been administered as cholecalciferol (vitamin D 3) or ergocalciferol (vitamin D 2).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Outcomes included total hip bone mineral density (BMD), lumbar spine BMD, quality of life, new symptomatic vertebral fractures, new symptomatic non-vertebral fractures, withdrawals due to adverse events, serious adverse events, all reported adverse events and additional withdrawals for any reason.

Main Results

We included seven RCTs with 941 participants, of whom 138 were randomised to calcium supplementation, 110 to vitamin D supplementation, 271 to vitamin D plus calcium supplementation, and 422 to placebo. Mean age ranged from 18.1 to 42.1 years. Studies reported results for total hip or lumbar spine BMD (or both) and withdrawals for various reasons, but none reported fractures or withdrawals for adverse events or serious adverse events. Results for the reported outcomes are presented for the three comparisons: calcium versus placebo, vitamin D versus placebo, and calcium plus vitamin D versus placebo. In all comparisons, there was no clinical difference in outcomes, and the certainty of the evidence was moderate to low. Most studies were at risk of selection, performance, detection, and reporting biases. Calcium versus placebo Four studies compared calcium versus placebo (138 participants in the calcium group and 123 in the placebo group) with mean ages from 18.0 to 47.3 years. Calcium supplementation may have little to no effect on total hip or lumbar spine BMD after 12 months in three studies and after six months in one study (total hip BMD: mean difference (MD) -0.04 g/cm 2, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.11 to 0.03; I² = 71%; 3 studies, 174 participants; low-certainty evidence; lumbar spine BMD: MD 0 g/cm 2, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.06; I² = 71%; 4 studies, 202 participants; low-certainty evidence). Calcium alone supplementation does not reduce or increase the withdrawals in the trials (risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.16; I² = 0%; 4 studies, 261 participants: moderate-certainty evidence). Vitamin D versus placebo Two studies compared vitamin D versus placebo (110 participants in the vitamin D group and 79 in the placebo group), with mean ages from 18.0 to 32.7 years. These studies reported lumbar spine BMD as a mixture of MDs and percent of change and we were unable to pool the results. In the original studies, there were no differences in lumbar BMD between groups. Vitamin D alone supplementation does not reduce or increase withdrawals for any reason between groups (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.19; moderate-certainty evidence). Calcium plus vitamin D versus placebo Two studies compared calcium plus vitamin D versus placebo (271 participants in the calcium plus vitamin D group and 270 in the placebo group; 220 participants from Woo 2007 and 50 participants from Islam 2010). The mean age range was 18.0 to 36 years. These studies measured different anatomic areas, one study reported total hip BMD and the other study reported lumbar spine BMD; therefore, data were not pooled for this outcome. The individual studies found no difference between groups in percent of change on total hip BMD (-0.03, 95% CI -0.06 to 0; moderate-certainty evidence), and lumbar spine BMD (MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.03; moderate-certainty evidence). Calcium plus vitamin D supplementation may not reduce or increase withdrawals for any reason (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.35; I² = 72%; 2 studies, 541 participants; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Our results do not support the isolated or combined use of calcium and vitamin D supplementation in healthy premenopausal women as a public health intervention to improve BMD in the total hip or lumbar spine, and therefore it is unlikely to have a benefit for the prevention of fractures (vertebral and non-vertebral). The evidence found suggests that there is no need for future studies in the general population of premenopausal women; however, studies focused on populations with a predisposition to diseases related to bone metabolism, or with low bone mass or osteoporosis diagnosed BMD would be useful.

3 Management of Osteoporosis

3.1 Lifestyle Factors

Achieving optimal PBM is important to protect against future osteoporosis — PBM is usually achieved by age 40 in women. To reduce the future risk of developing osteoporosis and for optimal bone maintenance, addressing lifestyle factors that may impact BMD is important.

3.1.1 Dietary Calcium Intake

The RDI of calcium for women under 50 years is 1000 mg/day and 1300 mg/day in > 50 years, equivalent to 3–4 servings of dairy. However, only 19% of older adults meet this recommendation. Patient education is vital to achieve calcium RDI, and calcium supplements advised for those unable to reach targets.

3.1.2 Vitamin D

Vitamin D is important for gastrointestinal calcium absorption and bone mineralisation. The major source of vitamin D is sunlight exposure, however balancing detrimental solar UV effects with vitamin D absorption can be difficult. Maintaining vitamin D status > 50 nmol/L is recommended for bone health at all ages, with appropriate sun exposure or vitamin D supplementation ‐ if required, 800–1000 international units per day is usually sufficient.

3.1.3 Protein

Adequate intake of dietary protein is important for acquisition and maintenance of bone density and skeletal muscle mass, to prevent bone loss and sarcopenia. The RDI of protein for adults is 0.8 g/kg/day data, however protein needs are increased in older adults and in pregnant and breastfeeding women. In pregnancy, RDI increases to 1.1 g/kg/day and 1.3 g/kg/day for breastfeeding women. In older adults, intake of 1–1.2 g/kg/day is recommended for bone health and to prevent sarcopenia.

3.1.4 Weight‐Bearing Exercise

Progressive resistance training and weight‐bearing impact exercises have beneficial effects to increase and maintain bone density, structure and strength in all age‐groups. Muscle resistance (strength) training should be regular (minimum twice per week), moderate to vigorous intensity and progressively increase in resistance load. Weight‐bearing impact exercises (e.g. jumping) should be performed most days and include moderate‐to‐high loads in a variety of movements. Balance training in isolation does not improve BMD but may aid in falls prevention. In frail patients, supervision is recommended for exercise programs to reduce falls risk. Walking, cycling and swimming are insufficient to impact and improve BMD, though they have other cardiovascular benefits.

### Strong, steady and straight: UK consensus statement on physical activity and exercise for osteoporosis [^1115z18n]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

For the vast majority of adults and older adults, taking part in activities that promote muscle and bone strength is safe and will help to maintain or improve function, irrespective of age or health. Providing authoritative and effective guidance may prompt an increase in physical activity and exercise. This will have wider beneficial effects on physical, social and psychological healthalongside physical literacy, including physical competence, knowledge and understanding, to engage in physical activities for life.

There is no UK guidance on exercise and osteoporosis. Although there is international guidance on safe and effective exercise and physical activity for bone health, from the USA, Australiaand Canada, some key questions remain unanswered. These include the appropriate intensity of exercise interventions for those with diagnosed osteoporosis, whether there are real harms from any particular types of exercises or activities, and whether or how to modify physical activity for specific 'fracture risk' groups.

### Osteoporosis: common questions and answers [^112fHFeJ]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis affects 10.2% of adults older than 50 years and is expected to increase to 13.6% by 2030. Osteoporotic fractures, specifically hip fractures, significantly affect morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. Screening for osteoporosis with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry should be considered for all women 65 years and older or women who are postmenopausal with clinical risk factors. The Bone Health and Osteoporosis Foundation recommends screening men 70 years and older and men with clinical risk factors; however, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force did not find sufficient evidence to support routine screening in men. Osteoporosis can be diagnosed by a T-score of -2.5 or less or the presence of a fragility fracture. All patients with osteoporosis should be counseled on weight-bearing exercise, smoking cessation, moderation of alcohol intake, and calcium and vita-min D supplementation. Treatment of osteoporosis is influenced by the patient's fracture risk, the effectiveness of fracture risk reduction, and medication safety. Patients at high risk of fracture should consider treatment with antiresorptive therapy, including bisphosphonates and denosumab. Anabolic agents such as teriparatide, abaloparatide, and romosozumab should be considered for patients at very high risk or with previous vertebral fractures.

### The benefits of strength training for older adults [^113271yY]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Aging is associated with a number of physiologic and functional declines that can contribute to increased disability, frailty, and falls. Contributing factors are the loss of muscle mass and strength as age increases, a phenomenon called sarcopenia. Sarcopenia can result or be exacerbated by certain chronic conditions, and can also increase the burden of chronic disease. Current research has demonstrated that strength-training exercises have the ability to combat weakness and frailty and their debilitating consequences. Done regularly (e.g., 2 to 3 days per week), these exercises build muscle strength and muscle mass and preserve bone density, independence, and vitality with age. In addition, strength training also has the ability to reduce the risk of osteoporosis and the signs and symptoms of numerous chronic diseases such as heart disease, arthritis, and type 2 diabetes, while also improving sleep and reducing depression. This paper reviews the current research on strength training and older adults, evaluating exercise protocols in a variety of populations. It is clear that a variety of strength-training prescriptions from highly controlled laboratory-based to minimally supervised home-based programs have the ability to elicit meaningful health benefits in older adults. The key challenges as this field of exercise science moves forward are to best identify the most appropriate strength-training recommendations for older adults and to greatly increase the access to safe and effective programs in a variety of settings.

### Strong, steady and straight: UK consensus statement on physical activity and exercise for osteoporosis [^111Wa3uu]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

The evidence reviewed was primarily composed of targeted exercise interventions, often conducted in a laboratory or clinic. Although such well-controlled interventions are informative about the parameters of exercise that are effective, they may be less available to many people with osteoporosis (although a fall prevention exercise programme should be available to those at risk of falls). We took the pragmatic decision to recommend some types of exercise available in the community that seemed likely to provide the necessary training stimulus (figure 1), although the type and intensity of such exercise may be much more variable. Even if such exercise is less effective it may at least postpone inactivity-related decline.

This statement provides updated evidence consideration and application to the UK setting. Limitations to the process include that the stakeholder groups were predominantly white and female, although advice and access to exercise is needed for all populations. Furthermore, we have no health economic evaluation. Limitations to the strength of recommendations arise due to limited evidence available in some areas, including lack of studies with fracture as primary outcome, inconsistent reporting of adverse effects of exercise and limited number of interventions in men, ethnic minority groups and people with osteoporosis (although recent findings from LIFTMOR studies suggest that principles developed in theoretical studies and broader populations apply to those with osteoporosis). A further limitation is that many individual trials have small sample sizes, and so we are reliant on meta-analyses of data pooled from multiple studies. This may cause problems with exercise interventions: heterogeneity may arise through different types of exercise interventions, intensity, frequency and volume of exercise or population characteristics, such as age, health status and habitual activity. Even within one exercise mode, such as resistance training, differences in exercise intensity, or velocity of contraction, could affect efficacy. Furthermore, selection of studies for meta-analyses has differed in search strategies, inclusion and exclusion criteria and classifications of exercise, sometimes producing conflicting findings. We have not formally rated the quality of the reviews in our analysis. Given the highly localised effects of exercise on bone, the efficacy at specific skeletal sites may vary depending on the precise exercises used. Finally, most studies focused on BMD, but localised adaptations in bone mean that such changes may not parallel changes in bone strength.

Q3.6 Exercise — regular weight-bearing exercise (e.g., walking 30 to 40 minutes per session, plus back and posture exercises for 20 minutes, 3 to 4 days per week) should be advocated throughout life; a meta-analysis of 16 trials including 699 subjects showed a significant improvement in lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) with exercise, and a separate meta-analysis concluded that exercise-induced improvement in lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD would reduce osteoporosis fracture risk by approximately 10%. The reduction in fall risk is emphasized because approximately 90% of hip fractures are due to a fall; both home and group exercise programs reduce falls, and exercises that challenge balance and improve trunk muscle strength produce a greater reduction in risk of falls.

Clinical considerations — general management in adults with low bone mass or osteoporosis: Clinicians should prescribe generic medications if possible rather than more expensive brand-name medications. Clinicians treating adults with osteoporosis should encourage adherence to recommended treatments and healthy lifestyle modifications, including exercise, and counseling for evaluation and prevention of falls. Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake should be part of fracture prevention in all adults with low bone mass or osteoporosis. Clinicians should assess baseline risk for fracture based on individualized assessment of bone density, history of fractures, response to prior treatments for osteoporosis, and multiple risk factors for fractures, noting that there are many available risk assessment tools with varying predictive value, which were not evaluated in the systematic review or in this guideline.

### Effects of moderate-to high-impact exercise training on bone structure across the lifespan: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114FtkYe]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Moderate- to high-impact exercise improves bone mineral density (BMD) across the lifespan, but its effects on bone structure, which predicts fracture independent of areal BMD, are unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated effects of impact exercise on volumetric BMD (vBMD) and bone structure. Four databases (PubMed, Embase, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science) were searched up to March 2022 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of impact exercise, with ground reaction forces equal to or greater than running, compared with sham or habitual activity, on bone vBMD and structure. Bone variables were measured by quantitative computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging at the tibia, radius, lumbar spine, and femur. Percentage changes in bone variables were compared among groups using mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) calculated via random effects meta-analyses. Subgroup analyses were performed in children/adolescents (< 18years), adults (18–50years), postmenopausal women, and older men. Twenty-eight RCTs (n = 2985) were included. Across all studies, impact exercise improved trabecular vBMD at the distal tibia (MD = 0.54% [95% CI0.17, 0.90%]), total vBMD at the proximal femur (3.11% [1.07, 5.14%]), and cortical thickness at the mid/proximal radius (1.78% [0.21, 3.36%]). There was no effect on vBMD and bone structure at the distal radius, femoral shaft, or lumbar spine across all studies or in any subgroup. In adults, impact exercise decreased mid/proximal tibia cortical vBMD (-0.20% [-0.24, -0.15%]). In postmenopausal women, impact exercise improved distal tibia trabecular vBMD (0.79% [0.32, 1.25%]). There was no effect on bone parameters in children/adolescents in overall analyses, and there were insufficient studies in older men to perform meta-analyses. Impact exercise may have beneficial effects on bone structure and vBMD at various skeletal sites, but additional high-quality RCTs in different age and sex subgroups are needed to identify optimal exercise protocols for improving bone health across the lifespan. © 2023 The Authors.

Osteoporosis is common throughout the world. Complications include fragility fractures. In this paper I will describe the condition as it relates to athletes young and old. It will be seen that osteoporosis may result from poorly managed sporting activities at the same time it may be ameliorated by exercise in those susceptible to the disorder. I will discuss the epidemiology, the protective effect of exercise, the therapeutic benefits of sport and exercise in the older population with fragility fractures, the effects of weight limited sport and the severe risks to those who diet and exercise intensely at the same time. I will cover the range of diagnostic investigations including imaging and non-radiological techniques and focus on advice to the coach and athlete to maintain bone health throughout an athletic and sporting lifetime.

### Exercise during childhood and adolescence: a prophylaxis against cystic fibrosis-related low bone mineral density? Exercise for bone health in children with cystic fibrosis [^1172Pw5S]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2008). Low credibility.

Inadequate bone mineral accrual during growth and accelerated bone demineralisation in adulthood are recognised as additional and serious complications for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). However, little attention has been given to preventative strategies for this population. Inadequate bone accrual during childhood and adolescence, and premature bone loss, lead to a failure to attain an optimal peak bone mass, osteoporosis and fracture in patients with CF. Pharmaceutical treatments may assist in the improvement of bone in patients with CF, but these are usually not preferable for use in children. Evidence indicates that regular, weight-bearing exercise significantly enhances bone accrual in healthy children. This paper reviews the literature concerning the potential for weight-bearing exercise to improve bone mineral accrual in children with CF. All relevant literature since 1979 was obtained and reviewed from the Medline, PubMed, Cochrane and PEDro data base. Evidence concerning the efficacy of exercise for bone health in CF is lacking. There have been no controlled trials investigating the value of weight-bearing exercise for bone accrual in children with CF. As exercise may offer an effective and enjoyable strategy to improve the bone development in children who have CF, exercise should be a high priority for randomised controlled trials in this population.

### Strong, steady and straight: UK consensus statement on physical activity and exercise for osteoporosis [^113dcCX8]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Key recommendations are that people with osteoporosis should undertake resistance and impact exercise to maximise bone strength; should take part in activities to improve strength and balance to reduce falls and undertake spinal extension exercise to improve posture, and potentially reduce pain levels caused by vertebral fractures, risk of falls and vertebral fracture. Although we recommend avoiding postures involving a high degree of spinal flexion (especially weighted) during exercise or daily life, and that people with vertebral fracture or multiple low trauma fractures should only exercise up to an impact equivalent to brisk walking, there is limited evidence of harms from exercise. People with vertebral fractures may benefit from exercise to reduce pain, improve mobility and quality of life, ideally with advice from a physiotherapist. Most importantly, inactivity should be avoided, physical activity encouraged and reassurance provided to counter the fear of moving that could detrimentally affect bone strength and health/quality of life more broadly.

### Targeted exercise against osteoporosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis for optimising bone strength throughout life [^1179zS7V]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Osteoporosis, falls and related fragility fractures represent a serious and global public health problem that is projected to increase as our population ages. Currently, it is estimated that 30%-50% of women and 15%-30% of men will suffer an osteoporotic fracture in their lifetime. From a biomechanical perspective, fractures represent a structural failure of the bone whereby the loads applied to the bone exceed its strength. Bone strength depends on a number of interrelated factors, including the amount of bone tissue (size and mass), the structure of bone (spatial distribution, shape and microarchitecture) and the intrinsic properties of the bone material (porosity, matrix mineralization, collagen traits and microdamage).

To date, most studies have used areal bone mineral density (BMD) measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as a surrogate measure of bone fragility. Despite reports that BMD is a good predictor of population fracture risk, current research indicates that up to 80% of all low-trauma fractures occur in individuals who are not osteoporotic but have normal or somewhat reduced BMD, i.e. osteopenia. This finding highlights the limitations of DXA to provide accurate measures of BMD or its ability to give relevant information about the major determinants of bone strength, such as the size, shape and structure of bone. For instance, small changes in bone mass distribution, cortical and trabecular structure, and bone geometry that contributes to a greater bone cross-section can lead to large increases in bone strength independent of changes in BMD.

### Is there a synergy between physical exercise and drug therapies for osteoporosis? [^111v4kfG]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Combining physical exercise with drug therapies for osteoporosis has been attempted with the aim to maximize osteogenic stimulus. Potential synergetic effects may prevent post-menopausal bone loss, or maximise gains during peak bone mass acquisition. However, research studies yielded mixed results, impeding the emergence of a consensus on the effects of exercise and drug therapies for osteoporosis on bone tissue. Independent, additive or synergetic effects of exercise and drug therapies have been reported, but while animal studies offer promising results, human studies are less clear. The aim of this work was to critically review existing data on the subject in an attempt to clarify existing knowledge and to encourage further investigations with a 2 x 2 factorial design, as elucidation of these questions will benefit osteoporosis prevention.

### Exercise for improving outcomes after osteoporotic vertebral fracture [^113J6zVL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Vertebral fractures are associated with increased morbidity (e.g. pain, reduced quality of life) and mortality. Therapeutic exercise is a non-pharmacological conservative treatment that is often recommended for patients with vertebral fractures to reduce pain and restore functional movement. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2013.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of exercise intervention of four weeks or greater (alone or as part of a physical therapy intervention) versus non-exercise/non-active physical therapy intervention, no intervention or placebo among adults with a history of vertebral fractures on incident fragility fractures of the hip, vertebra or other sites. Our secondary objectives were to evaluate the effects of exercise on the following outcomes: falls, pain, physical performance, health-related quality of life (disease-specific and generic), and adverse events.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases until November 2017: the Cochrane Library (Issue 11 of 12), MEDLINE (from 2005), Embase (from 1988), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, from 1982), AMED (from 1985), and PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database, from 1929). Ongoing/recently completed trials were identified by searching the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. Conference proceedings were searched via ISI and SCOPUS, and targeted searches of proceedings of the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and American Society for Bone and Mineral Research. Search terms or MeSH headings included terms such as vertebral fracture AND exercise OR physical therapy. For this update, the search results were limited from 2011 onward.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials comparing exercise or active physical therapy interventions with placebo/non-exercise/non-active physical therapy interventions or no intervention implemented in individuals with a history of vertebral fracture.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials and extracted data using a pre-tested data extraction form. Disagreements were resolved by consensus, or third-party adjudication. We used Cochrane's tool for assessing risk of bias to evaluate each study. Studies were grouped according to duration of follow-up (i.e. a) 4–12 weeks; b) 16–24 weeks; c) 52 weeks); a study could be represented in more than one group depending on the number of follow-up assessments. For dichotomous data, we reported risk ratios (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). For continuous data, we reported mean differences (MD) of the change from baseline and 95% CI. Data were pooled for Timed Up and Go test, self-reported physical function measured by the QUALEFFO-41 physical function subscale score (scale of zero to 100; lower scores indicate better self-reported physical function), and disease-specific quality of life measured by the QUALEFFO-41 total score (scale of zero to 100; lower scores indicate better quality of life) at 12 weeks using a fixed-effect model.

Main Results

Nine trials (n = 749, 68 male participants; two new trials in this review update) were included. Substantial variability across the trials prevented any meaningful pooling of data for most outcomes. Risk of bias across all studies was variable; low risk across most domains in four studies, and unclear/high risk in most domains for five studies. Performance bias and blinding of subjective outcome assessment were almost all high risk of bias. One trial reported no between-group difference in favor of the effect of exercise on incident fragility fractures after 52 weeks (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.71; very low-quality evidence with control: 184 per 1000 and exercise: 100 per 1000, 95% CI 31 to 315; absolute difference: 8%, 95% CI 2 to 30). One trial reported no between-group difference in favor of the effect of exercise on incident falls after 52 weeks (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.10; very low-quality evidence with control: 262 per 1000 and exercise: 277 per 1000; 95% CI 139 to 550; absolute difference: 2%, 95% CI -12 to 29). These findings should be interpreted with caution because of the very serious risk of bias in these studies and the small sample sizes resulting in imprecise estimates. We are uncertain that exercise could improve pain, self-reported physical function, and disease-specific quality of life, because certain studies showed no evidence of clinically important differences for these outcomes. Pooled analyses revealed a small between-group difference in favor of exercise for Timed Up and Go (MD -1.13 seconds, 95% CI -1.85 to -0.42; studies = 2), which did not change following a sensitivity analysis (MD -1.09 seconds, 95% CI -1.78 to -0.40; studies = 3; moderate-quality evidence). Exercise improved QUALEFFO-41 physical function score (MD -2.84 points, 95% CI -5.57 to -0.11; studies = 2; very low-quality evidence) and QUALEFFO-41 total score (MD -3.24 points, 95% CI -6.05 to -0.43; studies = 2; very low-quality evidence), yet it is unlikely that we observed any clinically important differences. Three trials reported four adverse events related to the exercise intervention (costal cartilage fracture, rib fracture, knee pain, irritation to tape, very low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

In conclusion, we do not have sufficient evidence to determine the effects of exercise on incident fractures, falls or adverse events. Our updated review found moderate-quality evidence that exercise probably improves physical performance, specifically Timed Up and Go test, in individuals with vertebral fracture (downgraded due to study limitations). However, a one-second improvement in Timed Up and Go is not a clinically important improvement. Although individual trials did report benefits for some pain and disease-specific quality of life outcomes, the findings do not represent clinically meaningful improvements and should be interpreted with caution given the very low-quality evidence due to inconsistent findings, study limitations and imprecise estimates. The small number of trials and variability across trials limited our ability to pool outcomes or make conclusions. Evidence regarding the effects of exercise after vertebral fracture in men is scarce. A high-quality randomized trial is needed to inform safety and effectiveness of exercise to lower incidence of fracture and falls and to improve patient-centered outcomes (pain, function) for individuals with vertebral fractures (minimal sample size required is approximately 2500 untreated participants or 4400 participants if taking anti-osteoporosis therapy).

### Targeted exercise against osteoporosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis for optimising bone strength throughout life [^112f9x81]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

In addition to the above-mentioned challenges, there are a number of other possible reasons why our meta-analysis indicated only small, albeit significant, effects of exercise on bone strength in young children (boys) and no exercise effects in adolescent boys or girls and adult women. Withdrawal of participants and exercise compliance are common problems associated with long-term exercise trials, and thus it is likely that many of the individual trials were not adequately powered to detect potential significant exercise-related benefits on bone strength. It is important that future studies carefully consider the sample size necessary to detect any potential between-group differences. Furthermore, there was considerable variability in the type and dose of exercise prescribed amongst the different intervention trials, all of which may account for the marked variability in the skeletal response to training.

Overall, it is clear from this review that further adequately powered and long-term (> 2 years) intervention trials are needed, particularly in adults, because changes in bone structural properties are reportedly small throughout adult life.

Structural Basis Underlying Exercise Gains in Bone Strength

Bones can adapt their strength to increased loads through surface-specific changes on the periosteal or endosteal surface either independently or in combination. For example, loading can increase cortical thickness through periosteal apposition, resulting in an increase in bone size and/or via the addition or reduced resorption of bone on the endocortical surface.

During growth, there is evidence that the surface-specific responses to loading are sex-specific and maturity-dependent. For instance, in a study using MRI to compare bone structural differences between the playing and nonplaying arms of young female tennis players, Bass et al. reported that exercise-induced gains in humeral bone strength in players prior to puberty were due to periosteal apposition, whereas the predominant effect after puberty was endocortical apposition (Figure 7). Using the same methodology, similar results were recently observed in pre-, peri- and postpubertal boys, but the periosteal gains in prepubertal boys were nearly double those observed in girls and their continued training into peripuberty resulted in further gains in bone size (periosteal apposition). In both studies, there was heterogeneity in the response to loading at the endocortical surface along the length of the bone. For example, in the prepubertal players, loading resulted in increased expansion at the midhumerus but no change or endocortical apposition at the distal humerus. This highlights that there are regional differences in bone adaptation within localized areas of the bone.

### The effectiveness of combined exercise interventions for preventing postmenopausal bone loss: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116XK8Gt]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Study Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Background It remains unclear whether exercise combining different types of physical activities (combined exercise interventions) would effectively preserve postmenopausal women's bone mineral density (BMD) at different sites. Objective To examine the impact of combined exercise interventions on lumbar spine, femoral neck, total hip, and total body BMD in postmenopausal women. Methods An electronic database search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science up to January 1, 2016. Randomized controlled trials that conducted combined exercise interventions and reported BMD values in postmenopausal women were included. Two authors independently extracted the data from individual studies. The primary end point was the change in BMD values from baseline to follow-up. The effect sizes were estimated by the standardized mean difference (SMD) methods using fixed-effects models. Results Eleven randomized controlled trials including 1061 postmenopausal women met the inclusion criteria. The levels of between-study heterogeneity were relatively low (I 2 < 50%). Exercise integrating different physical activities significantly increased lumbar spine (SMD, 0.170; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.027, 0.313; p = 0.019), femoral neck (SMD, 0.177; 95% CI: 0.030, 0.324; p = 0.018), total hip (SMD, 0.198; 95% CI: 0.037, 0.359; p = 0.016), and total body (SMD, 0.257; 95% CI: 0.053, 0.461; p = 0.014) BMD. Combined exercise interventions generated a beneficial effect on femoral neck BMD (SMD, 0.219; 95% CI: 0.034, 0.404; p = 0.020) in groups with women aged younger than 60 years, and significantly improved lumbar spine BMD (SMD, 0.349; 95% CI: 0.064, 0.634; p = 0.016) in groups with women aged 60 years or older. Conclusion Our findings suggest that combined exercise interventions appear to be effective in preserving postmenopausal women's BMD at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, total hip, and total body.

### Establishment of peak bone mass [^116oxgVj]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Among the main areas of progress in osteoporosis research during the last decade or so are the general recognition that this condition, which is the cause of so much pain in the elderly population, has its antecedents in childhood and the identification of the structural basis accounting for much of the differences in bone strength among humans. Nevertheless, current understanding of the bone mineral accrual process is far from complete. The search for genes that regulate bone mass acquisition is ongoing, and current results are not sufficient to identify subjects at risk. However, there is solid evidence that BMD measurements can be helpful for the selection of subjects that presumably would benefit from preventive interventions. The questions regarding the type of preventive interventions, their magnitude, and duration remain unanswered. Carefully designed controlled trials are needed. Nevertheless, previous experience indicates that weight-bearing activity and possibly calcium supplements are beneficial if they are begun during childhood and preferably before the onset of puberty. Modification of unhealthy lifestyles and increments in exercise or calcium assumption are logical interventions that should be implemented to improve bone mass gains in all children and adolescents who are at risk of failing to achieve an optimal peak bone mass.

Exercise Effects on Bone Strength: A Meta-Analysis of Randomised Controlled Trials

We identified and screened 1252 potential abstracts, of which 1224 were excluded either because they were unrelated to the specific topic, nonrandomised studies or duplicate studies from different databases. We then reviewed the remaining 28 full-text articles of RCTs in which exercise effects on bone were investigated. Seventeen of these 28 trials were excluded because of evaluation of BMD rather than estimates of bone strength. Finally, 11 RCTs investigating exercise effects on bone strength were thoroughly reviewed, one of which was excluded as a duplicate because it used the same sample and a similar outcome as in the investigators' previous trial. Thus, 10 remaining trials were analysed (Figure 1).

From the 10 analysed exercise RCTs that evaluated the effects of different modes of exercise training on estimates of bone strength at different skeletal sites, five were conducted in pre-/early pubertal children and/or adolescents, one in premenopausal women and four in postmenopausal women. To our knowledge, there are no published RCTs examining the effects of exercise on bone strength in adult men. From these 10 trials, the data needed for the effect size estimations were reported in six articles, and the authors provided the data required for three more original articles identified for this review. The findings from the remaining RCT could not be entered into the model because follow-up values were not reported in the original article and could not be obtained from the authors. However, the results were qualitatively analysed, and the findings are discussed in the text. Intervention characteristics of the 10 evaluated studies are summarised in Tables 1 and 2.

Because whole bone strength is an important determinant of fracture risk, there is still a need for further well-designed, long-term RCTs with an adequate sample size to quantify the effects of exercise on bone strength and its determinants. It is also important to better clarify whether there is an optimal mode and dose of exercise needed to optimise bone strength, particularly at the clinically relevant sites such as the femoral neck and lumbar spine.

Further detailed studies are also needed to characterise the material and structural changes underpinning any exercise-induced gains in bone strength, including region-specific adaptations in the distribution of cortical bone and changes in trabecular microarchitecture. From a clinical perspective, these adaptive processes are important because even small changes in bone geometry and structure can significantly improve bone strength. At present, the available data from intervention trials indicate that BMD and geometry adaptations to loading vary by age, skeletal site and sex. Prior to and early in puberty, the adaptation in cortical bone geometry to loading at diaphyseal sites appears to be mainly due to periosteal apposition. In contrast, at distal skeletal sites containing predominantly trabecular bone, exercise appears to increase tissue density, perhaps due to an increase in trabecular number or thickness or endocortical bone apposition. In adults, the limited data from intervention trials suggest that any increase in bone strength is due largely to increased tissue density, reduced endocortical bone loss, or both, rather than an increase in bone size (periosteal apposition).

Given the importance of cortical thickness and bone size to fracture risk, these findings indicate that the growing years may represent the most opportune time to enhance bone strength and reduce fracture risk. However, we must await the outcome of long-term trials before any final conclusions can be made with regard to whether exercise-induced changes in bone structure and strength translate into a reduction in fracture risk later in life.
