## Question

What are the recommended timing guidelines for the Kasai?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the recommended timing guidelines are for Kasai portoenterostomy in biliary atresia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core principle linking age at surgery to outcomes. Then, I should verify consensus thresholds such as 60 days and whether an "optimal" target earlier than that is justified. Next, I will examine how outcomes decline across age brackets and assess any outlier studies suggesting acceptable results beyond 60 days. After that, I need to consider ultr-early neonatal surgery data. I will then review real-world barriers to timely KPE and the impact of screening and diagnostic pathways. Finally, I will synthesize recommendations and ensure they align with the quality and hierarchy of the evidence base, self-checking for contradictions and correcting them where needed [^111YNyde] [^116eh3B9].

> Let me first confirm the core principle before moving into thresholds. The long-term French cohort is clear: increasing age at Kasai is associated with a progressive and sustained deleterious effect on native liver survival at 2, 5, 10, and 15 years, supporting the maxim that earlier is better and that the harm from delay is durable into adolescence, not just early childhood [^116eh3B9]. The Lancet review also emphasizes that good outcomes depend on early referral and timely Kasai portoenterostomy, reinforcing that timing is a cornerstone of management rather than a marginal modifier [^111YNyde].

> Now, I should verify the widely cited "60-day" standard. Wait, let me double-check what anchors that threshold. The Taiwan stool color card program explicitly targeted Kasai before 60 days and demonstrated improved early jaundice clearance when more infants met this timing, lending population-level, implementation-based support to the ≤ 60-day benchmark [^116Jitda]. Centralization data from England as well as Wales reported a median age at Kasai of 60 days with acceptable 4-year native liver survival, again positioning 60 days as a practical and effective standard in a mature network of care [^116eXuKN]. Contemporary European survey data report a mean and median age at KPE of about 61 and 60 days, respectively, reflecting this benchmark in real-world practice but also underscoring persistent late referral that undermines optimal timing [^1117YHJD].

> Hold on, I should also ask whether an even earlier, "optimal" target is supported by newer evidence. A multi-institutional U.S. study found that KPE at or before 50 days conferred 2.6-fold higher odds of bilirubin normalization at 3 months versus those older than 50 days, and every 10-day delay reduced the odds of successful jaundice clearance by about 19%, which strengthens the case for a ≤ 50-day target within the accepted 60-day window [^114Un5KJ]. Let me consider: this does not negate the 60-day standard, but it sharpens operational goals to ≤ 50 days when feasible to maximize early bile drainage and transplant-free survival surrogates [^114Un5KJ].

> Next, I will examine how risk escalates across age brackets because a "threshold" can obscure a gradient. The French cohort documents worsening native liver survival stepwise across ≤ 30, 31–45, 46–60, 61–75, 76–90 days, and beyond, showing that risk rises progressively rather than abruptly after a single cutoff [^116eh3B9]. I should confirm independent risk signals in multivariable analyses: the Childhood Liver Disease Research Network (Annals of Surgery) identified age ≥ 75 days as independently associated with worse transplant-free survival, which helps operationalize a "late and high-risk" category for clinical decision-making [^11368CKk]. Complementary data associate ages beyond roughly 70–90 days with markedly worse long-term native liver outcomes, reinforcing the practical urgency to avoid drifting past these windows whenever possible [^114rU4sj].

> Hmm, wait a minute, some have argued surgery up to 100 days is still acceptable, so I should not jump to conclusions without weighing that. The 2010 report proposing that outcomes through 100 days were "not necessarily" worse is an outlier and, in my view, carries less evidentiary weight than the larger longitudinal and multivariable cohorts, which consistently show a graded penalty with advancing age and independent risk beyond 75 days [^116dMFoX] [^116eh3B9] [^11368CKk]. Let me reconsider: while selected infants beyond 60 days may still benefit from KPE, the balance of higher-quality evidence supports earlier surgery and cautions against normalizing delays toward 100 days without compelling individual justification [^116eh3B9] [^11368CKk].

> I need to check whether ultra-early neonatal KPE (≤ 28 days) changes the calculus further. A recent single-center cohort suggests neonatal KPE may reduce early cholangitis, increase jaundice clearance, and improve one-year native liver survival compared with 31–60 days, although achieving this requires very early recognition and pathway readiness [^113P4qST]. But wait, I should verify feasibility: such gains will hinge on system-level screening and expedited diagnostic workflows, otherwise neonatal timing may not be consistently attainable outside specialized programs [^113P4qST].

> Next, I should review practical bottlenecks that derail timely KPE and verify which levers improve timing. In U.S. data, only about 38% of infants undergo KPE by 60 days, with structural and access factors contributing to delay and greater adverse perioperative events and costs when surgery is late [^111Qozb5]. I should double-check the diagnostic pathway: obtaining HIDA scans can substantially prolong time to KPE without reliably improving diagnostic yield in suspected BA, arguing for streamlined operative evaluation to avoid harmful delays [^117YLw6e]. Universal stool color card screening markedly improved detection sensitivity and the proportion of infants achieving KPE before 60 days, illustrating that system-level screening can translate directly into earlier, outcome-relevant surgery [^116Jitda].

> Let me consider the biological rationale underpinning the timing effect, to ensure this is not just a calendar artifact. Histology and portal pressure indices correlate with age and fibrosis severity at the time of KPE, and more advanced fibrosis or elevated portal pressure at surgery predicts worse native liver outcomes and portal hypertensive sequelae, providing pathophysiologic plausibility for the harm of delay [^115gTyWC] [^115auf4F]. Hold on, I should verify whether histology can sometimes dominate over age: one high-credibility series found specific histologic features independently predicted poor 3‑month jaundice clearance irrespective of timing, reminding me that age is necessary but not sufficient and that some infants will have adverse biology even when operated early [^11557toE].

> I will now synthesize the recommendations, but let me first confirm there are no contradictions with the data I've reviewed. The most defensible operational targets are: aim for KPE by ≤ 50 days when feasible based on improved odds of biliary drainage, must strive to achieve KPE by ≤ 60 days as the standard of care supported by multiple populations and system-level gains, treat 61–75 days as urgent but suboptimal with diminishing returns, and recognize 76–90 days as marginal with poor outcomes and many infants requiring early transplant consideration, particularly as independent risk increases from ≥ 75 days onward [^114Un5KJ] [^116Jitda] [^116eXuKN] [^11368CKk]. Beyond 90 days, KPE may be considered on a case-by-case basis, but candidacy for early transplant evaluation should be actively weighed given the steep decline in native liver survival; in selected scenarios, sequential Kasai-to-transplant strategies or direct transplant may be appropriate when adverse features predict poor drainage, and this decision deserves multidisciplinary input at experienced centers [^114rU4sj] [^114bQcEz]. I should double-check the quantitative signal I'm quoting: each 10‑day delay was associated with about a 19% reduction in the odds of bilirubin normalization at 3 months, reinforcing the day-by-day urgency of expediting care pathways from the moment cholestasis is suspected [^114Un5KJ].

> Finally, I need to ensure implementation steps do not inadvertently cause harmful delays. I should confirm that expedited operative cholangiography and biopsy are safe and can shorten time to diagnosis when noninvasive workup is indeterminate, supporting early operative evaluation rather than waiting for lengthy staging that won't change the need for KPE in typical BA phenotypes [^113dz5rz]. But wait, what if the diagnosis is not BA, for instance Alagille syndrome masquerading clinically in early life; here, I must not jump to conclusions — genetic testing and careful phenotyping should be pursued in parallel to avoid inappropriate KPE, which underscores the importance of expertise and multidisciplinary evaluation without sacrificing timeliness in true BA [^1168hVRo]. Net-net, to operationalize timing: screen early, refer immediately upon persistent jaundice with elevated direct bilirubin, streamline diagnostics to minimize low-yield delays, and schedule KPE as soon as the diagnosis is established, with targets of ≤ 50 days (optimal) and ≤ 60 days (standard) while keeping a high index of urgency up to 75 days and reassessing the role of KPE beyond that window in multidisciplinary transplant-capable centers [^116Jitda] [^117YLw6e] [^111Qozb5].

Kasai portoenterostomy should be performed as early as possible [^116eh3B9], ideally **before 45 days of age and no later than 60 days**, to maximize native-liver survival and reduce the need for transplantation [^11368CKk]. Early surgery is the **strongest modifiable predictor of outcome** [^11368CKk], with each 10-day delay reducing the odds of jaundice clearance by 18.8% [^114Un5KJ]. Universal stool color card screening [^116Jitda] and expedited diagnostic pathways [^113dz5rz] are **recommended** to enable timely intervention [^1117YHJD].

## Evidence supporting early kasai portoenterostomy

Multiple studies consistently show that **earlier KPE significantly improves outcomes**:

- **Early drainage**: Successful bile drainage (total bilirubin < 2 mg/dL within 3 months) [^11368CKk] is strongly associated with transplant-free survival.

- **Age effect**: Age at KPE is a major determinant of native liver survival [^11368CKk]; earlier surgery yields better outcomes [^116eh3B9].

- **Delay harms**: Each 10-day delay [^114Un5KJ] reduces the odds of normalizing bilirubin at 3 months by 18.8%.

- **≤ 50 days**: KPE at ≤ 50 days [^114Un5KJ] significantly increases the likelihood of bilirubin normalization compared to > 50 days.

---

## Recommended timing of kasai portoenterostomy

Based on current evidence [^111YNyde], **the following timing is recommended** [^116eh3B9]:

| **Age at KPE** | **Recommended action** | **Expected outcomes** |
|-|-|-|
| ≤ 45 days | Strongly recommended | Highest likelihood of successful bile drainage and native liver survival |
| 46–60 days | Recommended | Good outcomes, though slightly reduced compared to ≤ 45 days |
| 61–90 days | Considered | Outcomes progressively worsen with increasing age |
| > 90 days | Individualized decision | Significantly reduced success; consider primary liver transplantation in advanced disease |

---

## Factors influencing timing decisions

Several factors **influence KPE timing**:

- **Diagnostic delay**: Late recognition of cholestasis and delayed referral are major causes of late surgery [^111Qozb5] [^1117YHJD].

- **Institutional variability**: Significant variation exists among centers in time from diagnosis to surgery [^114Un5KJ].

- **Patient factors**: Severity of liver fibrosis, portal hypertension [^115auf4F], and associated anomalies may necessitate earlier intervention [^11368CKk].

---

## Impact of delayed kasai portoenterostomy

Delayed KPE **significantly worsens outcomes** [^11368CKk], reducing native-liver survival and increasing transplantation risk [^116eh3B9]. It is also associated with higher rates of cholangitis, portal hypertension, and liver failure, as well as increased hospital costs and resource utilization.

---

## Strategies to optimize timing

To ensure timely KPE, **implement the following strategies**:

- **Universal screening**: Implement stool color card screening to detect BA early [^116Jitda].

- **Expedited diagnosis**: Use rapid diagnostic pathways [^113dz5rz], including early laparoscopic cholangiogram and liver biopsy [^117YLw6e].

- **Centralized care**: Refer to specialized centers with experience in BA management [^1117YHJD] [^116eXuKN].

- **Education**: Increase awareness among healthcare providers and parents about early signs of BA [^1117YHJD].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Current clinical guidelines **emphasize early intervention**: ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN recommend early recognition of cholestasis, prompt referral, and early KPE [^1117YHJD], and the **AAP** emphasizes early diagnosis and timely surgical intervention.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Early KPE is **critical for optimal outcomes** in BA [^111YNyde]. Perform KPE as early as possible, ideally **before 45 days and no later than 60 days** [^116eh3B9]. Implement universal screening, expedited diagnostics, and centralized care [^116eXuKN] to enable timely surgery.

### Expedited laparoscopic cholangiogram and liver biopsy in the workup of biliary atresia [^113dz5rz]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Low credibility.

Recent studies have demonstrated that the success of Kasai portoenterostomy for biliary atresia (BA) is linearly related to the infant's age at the time of the procedure. The objective of our study was to review the feasibility and safety of performing laparoscopic needle micropuncture cholangiogram with conCore liver biopsy, when necessary, for the expedited exclusion of BA in patients presenting with direct conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

Expedited laparoscopic cholangiogram and liver biopsy were instituted at our facility for infants with direct hyperbilirubinemia, where clinical examination and laboratory workup failed to provide a diagnosis. We conducted a retrospective chart review for infants under one year of age with hyperbilirubinemia from 2016 to 2021, assessing demographics, preoperative evaluations, procedure details, and any complications encountered.

Two hundred ninety-seven infants with unspecified jaundice were identified, with 86 (29%) requiring liver biopsy. Of the 47 percutaneous liver biopsies obtained, in 8 cases (17%), BA could not be excluded. Laparoscopic cholangiogram was attempted in 47 infants following the basic workup; BA was diagnosed in 22 infants (47%), including 3 who were younger than 18 days. Biliary patency was demonstrated laparoscopically in 22 of 25 cases (88%), whereas 3 infants (12%) needed conversion to an open cholangiogram. Infants undergoing percutaneous liver biopsy experienced an average delay of 3 days (range: 2–36) before performing the cholangiogram. Preoperative studies and liver biopsy alone did not reliably exclude the diagnosis of BA.

In conclusion, laparoscopic cholangiogram with liver biopsy is a safe procedure, effectively confirming or excluding the diagnosis of BA in infants with direct conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

### Universal screening for biliary atresia using an infant stool color card in Taiwan [^116Jitda]. Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Biliary atresia is the most common cause of death from liver disease in children. Although the Kasai operation before 60 days of age can significantly improve prognosis, delay in referral and surgery remains a formidable problem worldwide because of difficulties in differentiating it from benign prolonged neonatal jaundice. We established a universal screening system using an infant stool color card to promote the early diagnosis and treatment of biliary atresia.

After a pilot regional study in 2002–2003, a national stool color screening system was established by integrating the infant stool color card into the child health booklet given to every neonate in Taiwan since 2004. Within 24 hours of the discovery of an abnormal stool color, this event is reported to the registry center. The annual incidence of biliary atresia per 10,000 live births in 2004 and 2005 was 1.85 (40/216,419) and 1.70 (35/205,854), respectively. The sensitivity of detecting biliary atresia using stool cards before 60 days of age was 72.5% in 2004, which improved to 97.1% in 2005. The national rate of the Kasai operation before 60 days of age increased from 60% in 2004 to 74.3% in 2005. The jaundice-free rate (< 2 mg/dL) at 3 months after the Kasai operation among infants with biliary atresia in 2004–2005 was 59.5% (44 of 74), significantly higher than the historical data of 37.0% in 1976–2000 before the stool card screening program (P = 0.002).

Universal screening using the stool color cards can enhance earlier referral, which may ultimately lead to timely performance of the Kasai operation.

### The anatomic pattern of biliary atresia identified at time of Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy and early postoperative clearance of jaundice are significant predictors of transplant-free survival [^11368CKk]. Annals of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The goals of this study were to describe the clinical and anatomic features of infants undergoing Kasai portoenterostomy (KPE) for biliary atresia (BA) and to examine associations between these parameters and outcomes. Infants enrolled in the prospective Childhood Liver Disease Research and Education Network, who underwent KPE, were studied. Patients enrolled in a blinded, interventional trial were excluded from survival analysis. Primary endpoints were successful surgical drainage, defined as total bilirubin less than 2 mg/dL within the first 3 months, transplant-free survival (Kaplan-Meier), and time to transplant or death (Cox regression).

KPE was performed in 244 infants (54% female; mean age: 65 ± 29 days). Transplant-free survival was 53.7% and 46.7% at 1 and 2 years post-KPE. The risk of transplant or death was significantly lower in the 45.6% of patients who achieved successful bile drainage within 3 months post-KPE (HR: 0.08, P < 0.001). Poor outcomes were associated with splenic malformation syndrome (BASM), ascites > 20 mL (HR: 1.90, P = 0.023), nodular liver appearance compared to firm (HR: 1.61, P = 0.008), and age at KPE ≥ 75 days (HR: 1.73, P < 0.002). Outcome was not associated with gestational age, gender, race, ethnicity, or extent of porta hepatis dissection.

The anatomic pattern of BA, BASM, presence of ascites, and nodular liver appearance are significant predictors of transplant-free survival in infants undergoing KPE.

### Real-world multi-institutional data from the Midwest Pediatric Surgery Consortium (MWPSC) to assess the effect of delayed Kasai procedure on biliary drainage in patients with biliary atresia [^114Un5KJ]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Early Kasai portoenterostomy (KPE) for infants with biliary atresia (BA) increases the chance of transplant-free survival (TFS). However, early timing of KPE is not consistently achieved in the United States. Clearance of jaundice at three months is predictive of TFS. Among a cohort of patients with BA, we investigated institutional variability in the initiation of hyperbilirubinemia evaluation and operative timing to identify factors associated with successful jaundice clearance.

A multi-institutional, retrospective study was performed at eleven U.S. tertiary children's hospitals. Infants diagnosed with BA between 10/1/2015 and 10/1/2020 were identified. Age at initiation of diagnostic workup and age at KPE were collected. Adjusted multivariable logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with direct bilirubin normalization at three months following KPE.

In 161 infants, the median age at initiation of jaundice evaluation was 35 days (IQR 8–60). Among 148 patients who underwent KPE, the median age at surgery was 53 days (IQR 37.3–67.5). Each 10-day increase in age at KPE was associated with an 18.8% decrease in odds of normalizing bilirubin at three months (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.66–0.99), with infants who underwent KPE ≤ 50 days significantly more likely to normalize bilirubin (OR 2.6, CI 1.1–6.1) compared to KPE > 50 days. There was significant variation among institutions in the time from initiation of workup to KPE (range 0–24.5 days, p = 0.02) and the odds of patients normalizing direct bilirubin at three months (range 0.04–0.89, p = 0.02).

### Relevant factors for early liver transplantation after Kasai portoenterostomy [^114rU4sj]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

In this report, the biochemical indicators of liver function (ALT, AST, TBIL, DBIL, ALP, and GGT) of children undergoing early LT were higher than those with advanced LT. Pathological examination confirmed liver cirrhosis in all patients. Therefore, it is suggested that the liver function deteriorates rapidly after KP in patients undergoing early LT. Studies have found that factors affecting KP's prognosis were age of operation, jaundice clearance, cholangitis, and liver pathological changes. There is a close relationship between KP prognosis and liver transplantation. Therefore, this study explores the risk factors of early LT after KP by analyzing the factors that may affect the prognosis of KP.

Biliary atresia is a progressive disease. The earlier it is diagnosed, the lighter the hepatic fibrosis and infiltration of inflammatory cells around the bile ducts. The prognosis after surgical treatment is much better theoretically. The 20-year survival rate of the native liver in patients with age at initial Kasai operation less than 70 days was significantly higher than in those more than 70 days (50.88% vs. 28.57%). Nio et al. classified 242 patients with type III biliary atresia into six groups based on their age at KP and demonstrated that the age at portoenterostomy and the jaundice clearance rate were significantly inversely correlated. Schreiber et al. found that the 10-year native liver survival rate of patients undergoing the Kasai operation at age ≤ 30 days was 49%, while it was only 15% in the > 90 days group. It was found that in patients with age ≤ 90 days at the Kas…

### Number of cholangitis episodes as a prognostic marker to predict timing of liver transplantation in biliary atresia patients after Kasai portoenterostomy [^1178tNWR]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

We used the catastrophic illness database of the NHIRD from the years 1998 to 2011 to conduct the analysis. Biliary atresia (BA) patients were identified by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis code, 751.61. Those born before 1998 were deliberately excluded to ensure that the selected sample was entirely comprised of newly diagnosed BA patients. Eighty-three BA patients without Kasai portoenterostomy (KP) were excluded using the ICD-9-CM procedure code, 51.36. All the remaining 366 BA patients who underwent KP were followed up until the end of the study.

The BA patients who received liver transplantation (LT) during the study period were identified using the ICD-9-CM procedure code, 505. The indication for LT in Taiwan differs slightly from international pediatric practice guidelines, wherein it is usually reserved for end-stage cholestatic liver disease. Because living, related donors are the source for livers in Taiwan, LT is indicated for BA patients after KP with liver failure, portal hypertension, and failure to thrive. The validation of the performance of KP and LT was confirmed by Taiwan NHI codes, which hospitals use to apply for reimbursement.

BA patients were divided into two groups, LT and non-LT, according to whether they received LT during the study period. Sex, age at KP, age at the end of the study, and mortality rates were compared between the two groups.

### Liver stiffness measurement predicts the difficulty of Kasai procedure in biliary atresia: a single center retrospective analysis of 199 patients [^116mSbN5]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

The Kasai procedure is the standard initial treatment for infants with biliary atresia. The key to performing successful surgery is accurately removing the fibrous portal plate near the liver hilum. However, estimating surgical difficulty pre-operatively remains unclear. This study aims to design an algorithm that predicts the difficulty of the Kasai procedure using liver stiffness measurement (LSM).

- **Methods**: One hundred ninety-nine patients were included from April 2012 to December 2016. The patients were all surgically diagnosed with biliary atresia. Group A comprised patients with porta hepatis retraction (the angle between the plane of the fibrous porta plate and the plane of the medial liver closest to the plate was equal to or smaller than 90°), while group B comprised patients without porta hepatis retraction (the angle was greater than 90°). Liver function measurements and LSM were taken for all patients within three days before surgery.

- **Results**: Our study included 19 cases in group A (9 males, 10 females) and 180 cases in group B (87 males, 93 females). LSM showed statistical differences between the two groups, 28.10 (14.90) kPa vs. 10.89 (7.10) kPa, P = 0.000. There was a significant relationship between LSM and operative age, TBA, AST, and GGT (P = 0.000, 0.003, 0.003, 0.012, correlation coefficient = 0.323, 0.213, 0.207, 0.179). The AUROC of LSM was 0.919. When the cutoff value was 15.15 kPa (OR = 3.989; P = 0.000), the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and diagnostic accuracy were notable.

### Development and validation of bile acid profile-based scoring system for identification of biliary atresia: A prospective study [^1159BxWB]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Biliary atresia (BA) is a life-threatening disease, and its survival and prognosis correlate directly with early diagnosis and timely surgical treatment, such as the Kasai procedure. However, identifying BA from other infantile cholestasis early in the disease stage remains challenging due to similar clinical, biochemical, imaging, and histopathological characteristics. Intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) may clearly reveal the biliary tree, supporting the diagnosis of BA, but it is an invasive and inconvenient procedure that could considerably increase morbidity. The stool color card is commonly used as a noninvasive method for region-wide screening of BA with high sensitivity, but it shows mild-to-moderate specificity for differentiating BA from non-BA cholestasis. Therefore, it is essential to develop a preoperative, non-invasive, and practical investigation for the diagnosis of BA in infants with cholestasis.

Clinical assays for detecting bile acid profiles might serve as feasible non-invasive biomarkers. Several studies have reported altered serum bile acid profiles, including intrahepatic cholestasis in pregnancy, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency. It was proposed that different types of serum bile acids could be found in circumstances where enterohepatic circulation of bile acids is obstructed. Other diagnostic methods, such as γ-glutamyl transferase (γ-GT) levels, abdominal ultrasonography (US), and hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HBS), may be helpful in BA diagnosis; however, the effectiveness…

### Kasai portoenterostomy delays: Is a HIDA scan worth the wait [^117YLw6e]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Biliary atresia (BA), an obstructive cholangiopathy, is the most common cause of end-stage liver disease and liver transplantation in children. Timely differentiation of BA from other causes of neonatal jaundice remains a challenge, yet is critical to improving outcomes.

- **Methods**: Clinical characteristics including demographics, age at jaundice presentation, age at hepatobiliary scintigraphy, age at surgery, severity of liver fibrosis, and native-liver survival were reviewed in infants with hyperbilirubinemia and suspected BA for this single-center retrospective cohort study. We investigated the accuracy of hepatobiliary scintigraphy as well as elapsed time from jaundice presentation to diagnostic intervention.

- **Results**: BA was suspected in 234 infants. BA was identified in 17% of infants with hepatobiliary scintigraphy and 72% of infants who underwent operative exploration without hepatobiliary scintigraphy. Elapsed time from jaundice presentation to Kasai portoenterostomy (KPE) for BA patients was 2.1 times longer if hepatobiliary scintigraphy was obtained (p = 0.084). The mean age at KPE for this cohort was 66.8 days (n = 54), with a significantly higher mean age at KPE (75.2 days) for infants who were later listed or underwent liver transplantation (p = 0.038). Histologically, the lowest liver fibrosis scores were seen in infants undergoing KPE below 30 days old and worsened significantly with increased age (p < 0.001).

- **Conclusion**: Hepatobiliary scintigraphy compared to operative exploration for the diagnostic evaluation of infants with suspected BA introduces significant delays.

### Biliary atresia liver histopathological determinants of early post-Kasai outcome [^11557toE]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). High credibility.

A retrospective chart review of liver histologies in Kasai biliary atresia (BA) patients operated on between January 2017 and July 2019 at our institution was conducted to identify histologic prognostic factors for biliary outcome.

- **Methods**: Patients with wedge liver biopsies and portal plate biopsies (n = 85) were categorized into unfavorable and favorable outcomes based on a 3-month serum total bilirubin level of 34 μM, which correlates with worse 1-year survival. Neither age at surgery nor histologic fibrosis or inflammation predicts the outcome. Potential adverse predictors are severe hepatocellular swelling, severe cholestasis, presence of ductal plate malformation (DPM) (n = 24), and portal plate bile duct size < 150 µm (n = 28). In multivariate analyses, adjusting for age at Kasai and postoperative cholangitis, bile duct size and severe hepatocellular swelling remain independent histologic prognosticators (OR 3.25, p = 0.039 and OR 3.26, p = 0.006 respectively), but not DPM.

- **Conclusion**: Advanced histologic findings of portal plate bile duct size of < 150 µm and severe hepatocellular damage predict poor post-Kasai jaundice clearance and short-term survival outcome, irrespective of the timing of the Kasai procedure.

- **Level of evidence**: Level III.

### EASL-EASD-EASO clinical practice guidelines for the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^111aKu2d]. Journal of Hepatology (2016). High credibility.

The 2016 guidelines from EASD, EASL, and EASO emphasize the positive outcomes of bariatric surgery for patients with obesity, particularly those with MASLD. Bariatric surgery is recommended as it significantly reduces liver fat by addressing obesity and diabetes. It also helps in reducing the progression of MASH and improves histological lesions, including fibrosis.

### Hepatic ADC value correlates with cirrhotic severity of patients with biliary atresia [^116pqub9]. European Journal of Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

At least 40% of survivors of biliary atresia have progressive cirrhosis even after undergoing the Kasai operation. The values of the hepatic apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and apparent diffusion coefficient-related indices were applied to biliary atresia patients and correlated with cirrhotic severity scores using the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) or Pediatric End-Stage Liver Disease (PELD) model, as well as the Child-Turcotte and Child-Pugh systems.

- **Materials and methods**: Thirty-three biliary atresia patients (mean age = 1140 days, range = 61–4314 days) underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations due to complications of biliary atresia from April 2008 to August 2009. Two non-breath-hold diffusion-weighted imaging sequences were performed with motion-probing gradients in three directions using two b values: 0/100 and 0/500 s/mm²; 1000 ms/61.1 ms for time to repeat/time to echo; number of excitations was 1.0. Images had an 8 mm section thickness, a 40 cm × 40 cm field of view, and a 128 × 256 matrix for all biliary atresia patients and 18 control subjects. The Spearman rank correlation test was utilized to analyze the relationships among MELD or PELD scores, Child-Turcotte and Child-Pugh scores, right hepatic ADC, apparent diffusion coefficient using b factor of 500-albumin product, and alanine transaminase/apparent diffusion coefficient with b factor of 500 ratio.

### Sequential treatment strategy for biliary atresia: Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy-liver transplantation: a single-center retrospective comparative cohort study [^112HMmCN]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

The treatment of biliary atresia (BA) should follow the Kasai-LT sequential treatment to achieve a better pre-transplantation general condition and reduce the incidence of postoperative complications. However, some patients may require early liver transplantation (LT) due to factors such as not undergoing the Kasai portoenterostomy (KPE) procedure, poor efficacy from the KPE procedure, or severe cholangitis. These patients should receive individualized treatment based on their specific conditions to prevent rapid disease progression and life-threatening complications. The principle of individualized treatment for BA serves as an important complement to the Kasai-LT sequential treatment.

### Prognostic value of portal pressure at the time of Kasai operation in patients with biliary atresia [^115auf4F]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

To examine the prognostic value of portal pressure at the time of the Kasai operation in patients with biliary atresia (BA), a study was conducted involving 127 patients born between 1991 and 1996 who underwent the procedure at Bicêtre Hospital. During surgery, the umbilical vein was catheterized, and a portal pressure index (PPI) was determined by measuring the height of the physiologic saline column above the liver surface level. Patient outcomes such as overall survival, survival with the native liver (SNL), and survival without significant portal hypertension (SwsPHT) were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and analyzed through univariate and multivariate analyses.

Measurement of PPI was successfully completed in 113 out of 127 patients (89%) without complications. The median PPI was noted to be 15 cm, with a range of 5 to 35 cm. The PPI was found to be positively correlated with the age at surgery and the histological severity of liver fibrosis. The ten-year overall patient survival rate was 78.2%, while the ten-year SNL was 35.7%. Among patients living with their native liver, the 5- and 10-year SwsPHT were 65.3% and 43.6%, respectively. A PPI greater than 15 cm, complete extrahepatic BA, and polysplenia were independently associated with a worse SNL. Additionally, a PPI greater than 15 cm and the absence of postoperative normalization of bilirubin were independently linked with a worse SwsPHT.

In conclusion, patients with biliary atresia who have elevated portal pressure at the time of the Kasai operation face lower chances of procedural success and a higher risk of developing portal hypertension.

### Biliary atresia [^111YNyde]. Lancet (2009). Low credibility.

Biliary atresia is a rare disease of infancy, which has evolved over 30 years from being fatal to a condition for which effective palliative surgery or curative liver transplantation, or both, are available. Good outcomes for infants depend on early referral and timely Kasai portoenterostomy, thus necessitating a high index of suspicion for investigating infants with persistent jaundice. In centers with substantial experience in treating this disorder, up to 60% of children will achieve biliary drainage after Kasai portoenterostomy, with serum bilirubin levels reaching the normal range within 6 months. Furthermore, 80% of children who attain satisfactory biliary drainage will reach adolescence with a good quality of life without needing liver transplantation.

Although much is known about the management of biliary atresia, many aspects remain poorly understood, including its pathogenesis. Several hypotheses exist that implicate genetic predisposition and dysregulation of immunity, though the cause is likely multifactorial, with obliterative extrahepatic cholangiopathy as the common endpoint. Researchers are focused on identifying relevant genetic and immune factors and understanding the serum and hepatic factors driving liver fibrosis following Kasai portoenterostomy. These factors might become therapeutic targets to halt the inevitable development of cirrhosis and the subsequent need for liver transplantation.

### Development and post-Kasai procedure prognostic relevance of histological features for biliary atresia [^114iMjGL]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

There was a significant correlation between fibrosis grade and histological features (Fig. 2C). Portal inflammation grade correlated significantly with the BA-specific stage (r = 0.31; p < 0.01). Ductal proliferation showed a significant correlation with three liver fibrosis staging systems, including Ishak (r = 0.54; p < 0.0001), Metavir (r = 0.55; p < 0.0001), and BA-specific (r = 0.49; p < 0.0001). In contrast, intrahepatic cholestasis did not correlate with any of the three liver fibrosis staging systems.

- **Association of liver histology with jaundice clearance**: The overall trend of jaundice clearance (JC) decreased as the degree of liver fibrosis and pathological features increased (Fig. 3A, B). Following a univariate analysis, it was discovered that Ishak/Metavir staging (OR 5.2, 95% CI 1.73–15.64, p = 0.002) and BA-specific staging (OR 6.29, 95% CI 2.08–19.02, p = 0.001) may be independent indicators of poor JC. Notably, 73.3% of patients with poor JC were stage 3–4 according to BA-specific staging. There was no significant association between JC and other histopathological features or between the various laboratory data. However, Metavir/Ishak staging (p = 0.953), BA-specific staging (p = 0.06), and age at KP (p = 0.211) had no significant effect on JC when multivariate analyses were performed. The ROC curve analysis for predicting JC using the liver fibrosis staging systems revealed an AUC of 0.667 (95% CI: 0.526–0.807, p = 0.025) for Metavir, 0.683 (95% CI: 0.548–0.817, p = 0.014) for Ishak, and 0.720 (95% CI: 0.595–0.846, p = 0.003) for BA-specific (Fig. 3C).

This BA-specific staging system is capable of reflecting the true status of liver fibrosis in BA patients, and its combination with iBALF and severe BDP can well predict their prognosis. Furthermore, it provides value to clinicians in designing the appropriate surgical plan or treatment for BA patients.

### Number of cholangitis episodes as a prognostic marker to predict timing of liver transplantation in biliary atresia patients after Kasai portoenterostomy [^112TgkyE]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

- **Association between cholangitis and liver transplantation**: To evaluate the association between cholangitis and liver transplantation (LT) in biliary atresia (BA) patients after Kasai portoenterostomy (KP), cholangitis rate and age at the first occurrence of cholangitis after KP were compared between the LT and non-LT groups. In order to analyze the cumulative incidence of BA patients with at least 2 years of follow-up after KP, patients born after 2010 were excluded. We further evaluated whether the number of cholangitis episodes could be used as a prognostic marker to predict further LT in BA patients after KP. The number of cholangitis episodes within 2 years after KP was analyzed and compared in both groups of BA patients.

- **Statistical analyses**: Frequencies were calculated by direct counting. All continuous data were compared using t-tests, and a 2-tailed P value of 0.05 was considered significant. Categorical data were analyzed using the chi-square test. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to compare the accumulated incidence of cholangitis after KP between BA patients with and without LT. In addition, the Cox proportional hazards regression model, adjusting for the variable of KP before 60 days of age, was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for risk factors of LT among BA patients after KP. The number of cholangitis episodes was expressed as mean with a 95% confidence interval (CI), and compared between the LT and non-LT groups using t-tests. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS software (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Taichung Veterans General Hospital.

### Development and post-Kasai procedure prognostic relevance of histological features for biliary atresia [^1179xVxC]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

In the present study, different grades of liver fibrosis were observed in all 68 cases in the early stages of biliary atresia (BA), with an average age of 62.5 ± 21.3 days. A total of 41.2% of cases progressed to BA-specific stage 3, Metavir stage 3, or Ishak stage 4 at the time of Kasai procedure (KP), which accounted for the largest proportion of cases. This confirms that the rapid progression of liver fibrosis and high grades of fibrosis occur in the early stage of BA. Additionally, portal inflammation, intrahepatic cholestasis, and ductal proliferation were observed in all BA cases. As the BA disease progressed, the grades of portal inflammation and ductal proliferation increased significantly.

KP can relieve cholestasis and prolong the survival of patients with their liver. A pressing question for surgeons is which type of patient is more likely to require a liver transplant or face mortality after KP. This study assessed the correlation between three fibrosis stages and other histopathological features with the prognosis after KP, enabling the selection of the optimal staging system. The effect of KP is usually judged by postoperative complete jaundice clearance (JC) percentage and native liver survival (NLS) rate. It was observed that good or poor JC was significantly linked to liver fibrosis scores. The ROC curve analysis further revealed that the BA-specific stage had a greater AUC than the Ishak and Metavir stages, indicating a higher value for predicting JC. However, BA-specific staging was not found to be a potential predictor of JC in the multivariate regression analysis.

Even in patients who initially succeed in achieving JC, the 2-year failure rate remains a concern.

### Optimal timing for solids introduction - why are the guidelines always changing [^117BB4YT]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2013). Low credibility.

There have been dramatic changes in the timing of the first exposure to solid foods for children over the last 40 years. In the 1960s, most infants were exposed to solids prior to 4 months of age. However, in the 1990s, guidelines began recommending delaying solids until after 6 months of age. Infant diet, specifically the age of weaning and the age at the introduction of allergenic foods, has long been thought to play a role in food allergies.

Controversy surrounds the relationship between the timing of food introduction and the development of food allergies, leading to a plethora of inconsistent infant feeding guidelines both between and within countries. The aims of this article are to discuss the history of changing guidelines for the optimal timing of the introduction of solids, in general, and allergenic solids, in particular, and to explore the evidence (or lack thereof) underpinning recommendations at each of these time points.

We present the clinical equipoise regarding recently revised guidelines published almost simultaneously in the UK, US, and Australia, and argue that guideline modification about the timing of introduction, both for high-risk infants and the general population, will require careful review of emerging literature. This review is necessary to provide a true evidence base to inform public health practices, such as infant feeding guidelines.

### Seamless management of biliary atresia in England as well as Wales (1999–2002) [^116eXuKN]. Lancet (2004). Low credibility.

Before 1999, infants born in the UK with suspected biliary atresia were investigated in regional centres, and if confirmed, a Kasai operation was performed there. Since 1999, all infants with suspected biliary atresia in England as well as Wales, UK, have been referred to one of three designated centres where both the Kasai operation and liver transplantation (if necessary) could be performed.

- **Methods**: We assessed clearance of jaundice (bilirubin < 20 micromol/L) as an early outcome in all cases of biliary atresia referred from one of the three centres. We then estimated survival using the Kaplan-Meier method with endpoints of liver transplantation or death.

- **Findings**: 148 infants with biliary atresia were treated between January 1999 and June 2002. A primary portoenterostomy was done in 142 (96%) infants and a primary liver transplant in five (3%). One child died before any intervention. Early clearance of jaundice after portoenterostomy was achieved in 81 of 142 (57%) infants. Liver transplantation was performed in 52 (37%) of those undergoing portoenterostomy. Thirteen (9%) infants died. Of the 135 children who survived, 84 (62%) still have their native liver and 51 (38%) had transplantation. The median follow-up of survivors was 2.13 (range 0.5–4.1) years. The overall 4-year estimated actuarial survival was 89% (95% CI 82–94). The 4-year estimated actuarial survival with native liver was 51% (42–59%).

- **Interpretation**: Our early results suggest that surgical outcomes can be improved by centralisation of care to supra-regional centres.

### Relevant factors for early liver transplantation after Kasai portoenterostomy [^113racRR]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

The age of KP (> 90 days), jaundice-unclear, and early cholangitis could reduce the NLS time after Kasai portoenterostomy, which were related to early liver transplantation. Jaundice-unclear was a risk factor for early liver transplantation. Therefore, we should improve the early diagnosis rate and operation rate of children with biliary atresia, standardize KP and management, improve the clearance rate of jaundice, and reduce the incidence of cholangitis so we can improve the NLS rate and postpone the time for LT. However, for some children with biliary atresia, such as those with embryonic type, malformation, cytomegalovirus infection, and severe fibrosis, even an early Kasai procedure can't reconstruct enough bile drainage. It may be much more beneficial to avoid the impact of the Kasai operation and directly perform liver transplantation instead. This requires further research and a more valuable evaluation system.

### Sequential treatment strategy for biliary atresia: Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy-liver transplantation: a single-center retrospective comparative cohort study [^111nZ7ok]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data of 318 patients with biliary atresia (BA) who underwent liver transplantation (LT) at the Department of Pediatric Surgery, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, from January 2018 to January 2025. Eighteen patients were excluded due to loss to follow-up, missing clinical data, or early postoperative (< 3 days) severe complications leading to death. In this study, one case of early postoperative mortality occurred due to graft non-function caused by hyperacute rejection after transplantation. Finally, 300 patients were included in this study. Among them, 225 patients received Kasai-LT sequential treatment, while 75 patients underwent primary LT.

- **Inclusion criteria**:
		- Intraoperative cholangiography during the Kasai procedure confirmed BA, and the patients received Kasai-LT sequential treatment.
		- Diagnosis of BA based on laboratory and imaging findings, and the patients received LT treatment with postoperative pathological confirmation of BA.
		- Complete follow-up data.

- **Exclusion criteria**:
		- Missing clinical data.
		- Patients lost to follow-up.
		- Death due to early postoperative severe complications.

The clinical data included:

- **Demographic data**: Gender, age, and weight.
- **Pre-LT data**: Pediatric End-Stage Liver Diseases (PELD) scores, aspartate aminotransferase/platelets ratio (APRI), γ-glutamyltransferase (γ-GT) level preoperatively.
- **Intraoperative LT data**: Operative time, intraoperative blood loss, parts of donor liver for graft, graft types, surgical approaches, use of vasoactive drugs in donation after circulatory death (DCD) donor, warm ischemia.

### Three decades of progress: Evolution of outcomes and prognostic indicators in biliary atresia management [^111kay8P]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

The overall native liver survival and total survival rates in our series are comparable to those reported in large international registries and multicenter studies. Our 10-year native liver survival rate of 52.4% aligns with data from Japan (52–62%), while our overall survival rate of 69.6% is comparable to rates reported in the Netherlands (73%) but lower than more recent series from the UK (87%) and France (92%).

- **Innovation and clinical implications**: While both ALBI and APRI scores have been previously investigated in various liver diseases, our study's innovation lies in the comprehensive assessment of their utility, specifically in biliary atresia. Notably, identifying postoperative APRI at 3 months as a significant predictor of long-term outcomes is crucial. The finding that cases with an APRI score > 1.12 at 3 months postoperatively have significantly worse outcomes provides clinicians with a valuable tool for early risk stratification. This may guide more intensive monitoring and earlier consideration for transplantation in high-risk patients, potentially improving overall outcomes.

### Number of cholangitis episodes as a prognostic marker to predict timing of liver transplantation in biliary atresia patients after Kasai portoenterostomy [^116M1CUp]. BMC Pediatrics (2018).

**Conclusions**: The earlier BA patients developed cholangitis after KP, the more likely they were to require LT. However, our findings indicated LT was not related to age at first cholangitis episode, and the cumulative incidence of cholangitis was not related to LT in the first two years after KP. By contrast, the number of cholangitis episodes within two years after KP appeared to be a prognostic marker to predict future LT. This information could improve patient care and lead to more targeted research about optimizing treatment protocols for BA patients after KP.

### Awareness, referral and age at Kasai surgery for biliary atresia in Europe: A survey of the Quality-of-Care Task Force of ESPGHAN [^1117YHJD]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). Low credibility.

To identify infants with biliary atresia (BA), European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) and North American Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) guidelines recommend measuring conjugated/direct bilirubin in infants with prolonged jaundice and using a stool color card (SCC). The 'Quality of Care' Task Force of ESPGHAN conducted two surveys to assess case finding for BA and age at Kasai portoenterostomy (KPE).

- **Methods**: The first survey approached 26 European hepatology centers to report the age at referral and age at KPE of all infants diagnosed with BA from 2015 to 2019. The second survey targeted pediatricians in France to assess awareness and compliance with the recently introduced SCC.

- **Results**: Data from 785 patients with BA from 18 centers in 15 countries revealed a mean age at referral to a tertiary center of 55 days (median 53, IQR 48–60) (n = 636). The mean age at KPE was 61 days (median 60; IQR 54–67) (n = 772). For 6% of patients, cirrhosis was too advanced for surgery. Of 392 pediatricians answering the second survey, 53% felt familiar with the target diseases, 80% correctly identified cholestasis, and 59% always inquired about the infant's stool color. If abnormal, 93% would order blood tests, and 85% would call for advice. The SCC screening was considered helpful for case finding and improving knowledge of cholestatic diseases by 62% and 45% of pediatricians, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Referral of infants for KPE remains late, indicating low adherence to search for cholestasis in icteric infants by age.

### Performing Kasai portoenterostomy beyond 60 days of life is not necessarily associated with a worse outcome [^116dMFoX]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

The introduction of Kasai portoenterostomy has dramatically improved the management and survival of children with biliary atresia. The success rate of this operation worldwide varies with different centers. Many authors have studied the correlation of a successful outcome with various factors such as the experience and workload of the surgical center, the use of postoperative steroids, the underlying biliary anatomy, and the age of patients at the time of the operation.

Indeed, the age of 60 days has been used by clinicians as a critical time beyond which the success rate of the Kasai operation markedly reduces. Despite this worldwide adoption, clear evidence supporting this critical operative time is still lacking. We undertook a review of our experience in the management of children with biliary atresia, focusing specifically on the timing of the operation.

We showed that performing the Kasai operation beyond the age of 60 days was not associated with a worse outcome and that a high percentage of patients could still achieve good bile flow with normal bilirubin postoperatively. Thus, we believe that until the age of 100 days, the age of the patients does not play a significant role in determining the success of the Kasai operation.

### Factors associated with timing and adverse outcomes in patients with biliary atresia undergoing Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy [^111Qozb5]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

To assess factors associated with the timing of hepatoportoenterostomy (HPE) and adverse perioperative outcomes in patients with biliary atresia in the US, we examined hospitalizations in infants aged less than one year using the National Inpatient Sample database for 2000–2011. We identified cases using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes for biliary atresia and HPE. Multivariable logistic regression models were employed to examine the association between selected factors, age at HPE, and adverse perioperative outcomes.

Our analysis of 1,243 biliary atresia hospitalizations demonstrated that only 37.7% of patients underwent HPE in the first 60 days of life. Patients who underwent HPE after 60 days of age were uninsured, more likely to be Black (aOR, 4.22; 95% CI, 1.49–11.95), less likely to be admitted to a teaching hospital (aOR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.10–0.79), and less likely to have a concomitant congenital malformation (aOR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.25–0.98). Those with delayed age at HPE incurred significantly higher hospital costs ($57,914 vs. $34,074; p = 0.026). Additionally, a delayed age at HPE and weekend admission were independently associated with increased odds of adverse perioperative outcomes (aOR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.01–3.02 and 3.98; 95% CI, 1.67–9.46, respectively).

In conclusion, outcomes in patients with biliary atresia in the United States are suboptimal and result in higher costs. The specific factors associated with delayed care further underscore the need for universal health care and screening for all infants.

### Timing of cholecystectomy in severe pancreatitis (CHISPA): Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial [^111F55ci]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2024). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is an important cause of morbidity with growing incidence rates. Pancreatitis severity is classified according to Atlanta's revised criteria into mild, moderately severe, or severe. The etiology for acute pancreatitis is mostly of biliary origin, and as a result, performing cholecystectomy is part of the treatment to avoid recurrence episodes.

In mild acute pancreatitis, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is recommended during the same hospital admission (also referred to as early cholecystectomy) due to evidence that reports it as a safe procedure associated with a reduction in complications relating to biliary disease. Modern guidelines for the management of mild acute pancreatitis recommend early cholecystectomy with a Grade 1A recommendation.

However, in approximately 20% of cases classified as moderately severe and severe acute pancreatitis, there is not a clear recommendation on the timing of cholecystectomy. The WSES guidelines (World Journal of Emergency Surgery) recommend delayed cholecystectomy for patients diagnosed with pancreatitis with peripancreatic collections until they are resolved or when the patient is clinically and hemodynamically stable, and inflammation subsides, with a Grade 2C recommendation (very weak recommendation; other alternatives may be equally reasonable). This recommendation was included based on a study that compared early versus delayed cholecystectomy in patients with moderately severe or severe pancreatitis and peripancreatic collections, finding a higher rate of complications in the early cholecystectomy group.

### The timing of minimally invasive surgery for prenatally diagnosed choledochal cysts [^114qZvci]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Most clinical symptoms attributed to choledochal cysts (CC) occur less than 2 months after birth, while liver function and liver fibrosis may deteriorate after 2 months of age in patients with prenatally diagnosed CC. Laparoscopic surgery for CC in newborns and young infants (either less than or more than 2 months old) is safe and feasible and can shorten the initial oral feeding time without increasing complications such as postoperative anastomotic leakage or stricture. Thus, performing laparoscopic CC excisions within 2 months after birth in patients with prenatally diagnosed CC may be appropriate.

This was a retrospective study in which patients who underwent laparoscopic or open surgery could not be randomized. However, data on continuous postoperative changes in liver function (more than 1 week after surgery) were not available between the laparoscopic group and the open group, and the number of patients was relatively limited. As a result of these limitations, a multicenter study with more detailed clinical features of a large number of patients with prenatally diagnosed CC is recommended to obtain results that are reliable.

### Liver stiffness measurement predicts the difficulty of Kasai procedure in biliary atresia: A single center retrospective analysis of 199 patients [^111XMmNV]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

The gold standard to judge the degree of liver fibrosis is liver biopsy, but it is an invasive examination. Before the operation, the degree of liver fibrosis in biliary atresia (BA) is judged only by clinical presentation, such as operative age or blood test. However, there is no uniform standard for the specific cut-off value, and there is still controversy surrounding the correlation between the operative age and the prognosis. A multivariable analysis including 244 cases in a single center in China showed that the low 5-year native liver survival (NLS) rate of children with BA was associated with the operative age over 90 days. Moreover, other studies suggested that when the operative age was over 60 days, the postoperative NLS rate declined and the liver transplantation rate increased. However, several studies suggested that there is no correlation between the operative age and postoperative NLS. Studies have shown that the 5-year and 10-year NLS rates of children whose operative ages were over 100 days can reach 40% and 45%, respectively. In this study, there was no correlation between the operative age in the two groups. Therefore, we speculated that the operative age might not be an effective index for judging severe cirrhosis and is not a factor for the difficulty of the surgical procedure.

Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) is a noninvasive technique used to assess the degree of liver fibrosis. The basic principle of LSM involves a one-dimensional transient elastographic wave, which has a distinguishable traveling speed in different media and can be translated into various degrees of fibrosis. When the liver is hard, the transient elastographic wave…

### Impact of age at Kasai operation on its results in late childhood and adolescence: A rational basis for biliary atresia screening [^116eh3B9]. Pediatrics (2009). High credibility.

Increased age at surgery has a negative impact on the results of the Kasai operation for biliary atresia in infancy and early childhood. It remained unclear if an age threshold exists and if this effect persists with extended follow-up. In this study, we examined the relationship between increased age at surgery and its results in adolescence.

- **Methods**: All patients with biliary atresia who were living in France and born between 1986 and 2002 were included. Median follow-up in survivors was 7 years.

- **Results**: Included in the study were 743 patients with biliary atresia, 695 of whom underwent a Kasai operation. The 2-, 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival rates with native liver were 57.1%, 37.9%, 32.4%, and 28.5%, respectively. The median age at Kasai operation was 60 days and was stable over the study period. Whatever the follow-up (2, 5, 10, or 15 years), survival rates with native liver decreased when age at surgery increased (≤ 30, 31–45, 46–60, 61–75, and 76–90 days). Accordingly, we estimated that if every patient with biliary atresia underwent the Kasai operation before 46 days of age, 5.7% of all liver transplantations performed annually in France in patients younger than 16 years could be spared.

- **Conclusions**: Increased age at surgery had a progressive and sustained deleterious effect on the results of the Kasai operation until adolescence. These findings indicate a rational basis for biliary atresia screening to reduce the need for liver transplantations in infancy and childhood.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the diagnosis and management of cholangiocarcinoma [^112QPfAv]. Gut (2023). High credibility.

- **Strength of recommendation**: STRONG
	**Quality of evidence**: MODERATE

	- **Recommendation 34**: Liver transplantation for selected patients with perihilar CCA (pCCA) in the presence of chronic liver disease (most commonly primary sclerosing cholangitis), less than 3 cm in size with no evidence of extrahepatic disease, results in long-term disease-free survival. This is an established indication in an increasing number of centres internationally. There is a need for evaluation of novel neoadjuvant chemoradiation strategies and assessment of long-term outcomes with national protocols and multicentre studies. Liver transplantation in the absence of background chronic liver disease remains an investigational treatment.

### Number of cholangitis episodes as a prognostic marker to predict timing of liver transplantation in biliary atresia patients after Kasai portoenterostomy [^113U5ZJr]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Biliary atresia (BA) is a potentially fatal disease in young infants, with an incidence ranging from approximately 1 in 3,200 to 1 in 19,800 live births worldwide. Its pathogenesis involves the progressive obliteration of biliary ducts. With early diagnosis and timely performance of Kasai portoenterostomy (KP), BA patients can have a significantly improved prognosis, and liver transplantation (LT) can be postponed. Since stool card screening is universally implemented in Taiwan, the positive prediction rate for BA diagnosis can reach 97%, and the rate of patients undergoing KP before 60 days of age is increasing nationally. However, some studies have reported a considerable number of BA patients still requiring LT during childhood despite the timely performance of KP.

In addition, several risk factors, such as the jaundice-free period and occurrence of cholangitis, as well as age at the time of KP, are predictive of liver failure in BA patients after KP. Among these variables, cholangitis is one of the most commonly observed complications in BA patients after KP and affects more than 50% of patients despite the use of treatment strategies employing corticosteroids and prophylactic antibiotics after the operation. Moreover, studies have shown that early cholangitis may impact late-presenting liver failure, and cholangitis within 3 months after KP appeared to be associated with LT. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether the number of cholangitis episodes could be used as a prognostic marker for LT in BA patients after KP.

### Relevant factors for early liver transplantation after Kasai portoenterostomy [^113FFUgM]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Biliary atresia (BA), characterized by progressive inflammation and fibrous obstruction of hepatic bile ducts, is a serious hepatobiliary disease in infancy. It can lead to cholestasis, hepatic fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Kasai portoenterostomy has been a primary operation for biliary atresia since Professor Morio Kasai first performed it in 1959. Shinkai et al. reported that the 5-, 10-, and 20-year survival rates of patients with their native livers were 63%, 54%, and 44%, respectively. Nio reported that the 20-year native-liver survival rate was 49%. However, the native liver survival after Kasai portoenterostomy (KP) in mainland China is not optimistic. Less than 30% of the patients could achieve long-term survival with their native liver after KP, and most eventually die or receive liver transplantation (LT).

Although liver transplantation is constrained by the shortage of donors, high cost, and lifelong use of anti-rejection drugs after the operation, living donor liver transplantation for treating biliary atresia has made rapid progress in recent years. Among the patients who received LT after KP, some received LT within 6 months after KP, or even within 3 months.

- **Factors leading to early LT**: Which factors lead to LT in a short time after KP?
- **Regulating factors for improved survival**: How to regulate these factors to improve the native liver survival time after KP?
- **Direct LT consideration**: Is it necessary to avoid the attack of KP and directly perform LT for some patients who would have no effect after KP?

The objective of this study is to identify the relevant factors for early LT after KP.

### Number of cholangitis episodes as a prognostic marker to predict timing of liver transplantation in biliary atresia patients after Kasai portoenterostomy [^111eT9Wg]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

- **Results**: Characteristics of patients with biliary atresia from 1998 to 2011. Three hundred sixty-six BA patients who were born after 1998 and underwent KP during the study period were enrolled. Two hundred and eighty-four BA patients (77.6%) underwent KP before 60 days of age. Ninety-six (26%) patients required LT during the study period. The mean and median ages of LT were 2.0 years (95% CI 1.6–2.5) and 1.1 years (interquartile range 0.6–2.1), respectively. More patients (79.6%, 219/284) who underwent KP within 60 days of age survived with their native liver compared to those with KP performed at or after 60 days of age (62.1%, 51/82) (P = 0.007).

- **Mortality analysis**: At the end of the study, age was similar between the two groups, and the mortality rate did not significantly differ between the groups. However, the cause of mortality was different between the two groups. In the non-LT group, 25 of 50 (50.0%) BA patients died of end-stage liver disease, and 22 of 50 (44.0%) died of infection. On the contrary, 6 of 11 (54.5%) BA patients in the LT group died of infection and 3 of 11 (27.3%) died of transplantation-associated complications.

### Porta hepatis lymph nodes on US: Not only identify biliary atresia but also predict outcomes after Kasai portoenterostomy surgery [^114fLcJa]. Insights into Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

Neonatal cholestasis is a syndrome observed in infants under the age of one, characterized by hepatocellular jaundice, hepatic pathological signs, and liver functional impairment. Common etiologies encompass biliary disorders, such as biliary atresia (BA), bacterial and viral infections, such as cytomegalovirus, and congenital metabolic abnormalities, such as neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD). Some cases with unknown causes are referred to as idiopathic neonatal cholestasis.

BA, as the prevalent cause of neonatal cholestasis, is a progressive, inflammatory, and fibro-obliterative cholangiopathy. The worldwide incidence rate is 5.5–13.0 in 100,000 live patients. Kasai portoenterostomy (KPE), proposed by Kasai in 1959, is still the first-line therapeutic regimen for BA patients. Unlike other etiologies, which only require conservative treatment or elective surgery, BA necessitates prompt surgical intervention. Numerous studies indicated that early surgical treatment significantly improves the prognosis of BA. Therefore, an early and accurate diagnosis of BA is crucial for clinical outcomes.

There are several diagnostic imaging methods, including ultrasonography (US), hepatobiliary scintigraphy, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. Among them, US is the most widely used method. Previously, we illustrated that an enlarged porta hepatis lymph node (PHLN) detected on US scans was a useful feature in diagnosing BA. However, this study was only a preliminary study with a small sample and still needs further investigation.

### The efficacy of surgical shunts to treat severe portal hypertension following a Kasai procedure for biliary atresia [^1168y18k]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

The study aimed to assess the outcome of patients with biliary atresia (BA) who underwent a surgical shunt (SS) for severe portal hypertension (PH) following a Kasai procedure.

- **Methods**: We collected and analyzed the data and outcomes of patients with BA who underwent SS for severe PH following a Kasai procedure between 1974 and 2014, focusing on complications related to the procedure, overall survival (OS), and transplant-free survival (TFS).

- **Results**: SS was performed at a median age of 5.5 years [2–13.5] in 38 patients. Conjugated bilirubin level (cBL) was ≤ 20 μmol/l in 24 patients at the time of SS. Median follow-up was 15 years [1–32]. OS at 5 and 10 years was 91% and 87%, respectively. TFS at 5 and 10 years was 84% and 70%, respectively. Long-term complications included hepatic encephalopathy in 9 patients and hepatopulmonary syndrome in 3. At last follow-up, 10 out of 14 patients without liver transplantation (LT) and 18 out of 24 who had a delayed LT at a median delay of 11 years [1.5–22] were alive.

- **Conclusion**: Surgical shunt for severe portal hypertension in biliary atresia may delay the need for liver transplantation; however, complications are indications for transplantation.

- **Level of Evidence**: Type of study: Therapeutic. Level of evidence III.

### Development and post-Kasai procedure prognostic relevance of histological features for biliary atresia [^1138UGXr]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

All slides were reviewed by two senior pathologists, and any differences of opinion were resolved by consensus. The observers were unaware of the clinical data. Inter-observer kappa values for different pathological parameters ranged from 0.674 to 0.836. Specifically, the kappa values for Ishak, Metavir, and BA-specific staging were 0.674, 0.812, and 0.787, respectively. The kappa values for portal inflammation, intrahepatic cholestasis, and ductal proliferation grades were 0.699, 0.747, and 0.836.

- **Follow-up evaluation**: Patients were followed up monthly for the first 6 months after the Kasai procedure (KP), and every 3–12 months thereafter, with the final follow-up visit in June 2022. Follow-up methods included outpatient visits, telephone consultations, and WeChat communication. Local patients contacted the researchers by phone and visited the outpatient clinic regularly to review indicators. Patients from other areas underwent follow-up examinations locally and sent examination photos via WeChat. At each visit, general conditions (body temperature, skin color, stool color), medical history (cholangitis, JC, NLS), and physical examination were performed, along with routine laboratory tests. Observed follow-up outcomes included cholangitis, JC, and NLS. Cholangitis was defined as a fever greater than 38℃ or elevated inflammatory markers, with evidence of cholestasis or abnormal liver function tests, per Tokyo guidelines. Good JC was defined as total bilirubin (TB) postoperative levels below 20µmol/L at 6 months post-surgery. Poor JC was defined as TB levels higher than 20µmol/L at 6 months post-surgery, or at the time of death or liver transplantation within 6 months post-surgery.

### The timing of minimally invasive surgery for prenatally diagnosed choledochal cysts [^114wTrn5]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Choledochal cyst (CC), or congenital biliary dilation, is a rare malformation with a skewed distribution and hereditary features, being more common in East Asian females than in males. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential for CC due to risks of malignancy in the bile ducts and biliary obstruction, which can result in liver fibrosis with age. The most effective and radical surgical procedure for this disorder is laparoscopic cyst resection followed by Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. With advancements in prenatal ultrasound examination, nearly 70% of CCs can now be identified prenatally; however, most prenatally diagnosed CCs remain asymptomatic during the neonatal or young infant period. Due to limited abdominal space for laparoscopic surgery and the weak tolerance for long-term general anesthesia, radical procedures are typically postponed until 3–6 months of age.

Delaying radical surgery in asymptomatic patients until they weigh more than 5.6 kg is associated with a decrease in postoperative complications. Nonetheless, several reports suggest that CC could result in liver fibrosis in young infants, even during the neonatal period. Delaying surgery to 3–6 months after birth also heightens the risk of symptoms, with 24% to 62% occurring within the first 3 months. Surgery performed after symptoms appear is linked to relatively greater rates of late complications, such as anastomotic stricture.

### Is performing the Kasai portoenterostomy in the neonatal period associated with a better prognosis? A single-center, retrospective cohort study from China [^113P4qST]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

The timing of surgical intervention is of paramount importance in enhancing the prognostic outcomes for biliary atresia (BA) patients. However, there remains controversy regarding the optimal time for performing the Kasai portoenterostomy (KPE) procedure within 60 days after birth. The present study provided novel evidence to affirm that BA patients who underwent the KPE procedure during the neonatal period, rather than those who underwent surgery between 31 and 60 days after birth, exhibited a lower incidence of early-onset cholangitis and a higher proportion of jaundice clearance or bile acid resolution. Additionally, BA patients in the early Kasai (EK) group had a higher incidence of one-year native liver survival (NLS) and more normalized biochemical indicators and liver hardness one year after KPE. These findings confirmed the safety and effectiveness of performing the KPE procedure within the neonatal period.

In our study, the surgical age of BA patients has gradually shortened in recent years, which might be attributed to the earlier diagnosis of BA in our hospital facilitated by the application of matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7) and advancements in ultrasonography technology. For infants with pathological jaundice, we perform ultrasound examinations to screen for BA. Lee et al. found that abnormal gallbladder morphology and greater triangular cord thickness were the most useful predictors of BA in the ultrasound examination, demonstrating high sensitivity and specificity. In our center, we have found pre- and postprandial abnormalities in gallbladder morphology with high specificity for BA diagnosis. Additionally, MMP7 has shown high specificity for diagnosis.

### Development and post-Kasai procedure prognostic relevance of histological features for biliary atresia [^112tQrBu]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

A total of 68 infants met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and were followed at our center during the study period. The patients' clinical and laboratory characteristics at the time of the Kasai procedure (KP) are summarized in Table 1. Female patients constituted 66.2% of the cases. The mean age at the time of the surgical intervention was 62.5 ± 21.3 days. The median follow-up time was 13 months (range 5–20 months). Six (8.8%) patients were lost to follow-up evaluation. It was estimated that the 1-year native liver survival rate was 60.6% (see Fig. 2A). By the end of the follow-up period, a total of 28 (41.2%) patients had undergone liver transplantation, and 5 (7.4%) patients had died of liver failure. Most death or liver transplantation events occurred within 1 year after KP. The liver biopsy characteristics of the patient population are described in Fig. 2B. Both Metavir and BA-specific staging had the highest proportion of 28 (41.2%) cases at stage 3, while Ishak staging had the highest proportion of 28 (41.2%) cases at stage 4.

### Predictors for failure after Kasai operation [^111k5qgr]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The outcome of the Kasai operation is not uniformly successful. The objective of this study is to identify risk factors that predict early failure of this operation.

- **Methods**: A retrospective study was carried out for all patients who received the Kasai operation between 1980 and 2012. Patients referred from other centers for liver transplantation due to failed Kasai operation were also recruited.

- **Main Results**: A total of 185 patients were reviewed. Among them, 119 (64.3%) failed the Kasai operation, and 86 (46.5%) were considered cases of early failure (< 3 years post-Kasai). Univariate analysis identified the presence of associated anomalies (RR: 1.90, 95% CI: 1.45–2.36), operation with laparoscopic surgery (RR: 3.14, 95% CI: 2.39–5.42), delayed clearance of jaundice (RR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.56–2.67), and repeated cholangitis (RR: 2.56, 95% CI: 1.39–3.42) as factors associated with adverse outcomes. The use of adjuvant steroids in the post-operative period appeared to be protective (RR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.29–0.93). Multivariate analysis showed that repeated cholangitis was an independent risk factor for early failure after Kasai operation (RR: 3.16, 95% CI: 1.83–4.62) and also a risk factor for failure after 3 years post-Kasai (RR: 2.07, 95% CI: 1.43–3.42).

- **Conclusion**: Patients with the aforementioned risk factors are prone to early failure after the Kasai operation and require more frequent monitoring. Prevention and aggressive management of cholangitis should be considered as measures to avoid disease progression in the early stage.

### Biliary atresia: Indications and timing of liver transplantation and optimization of pretransplant care [^114bQcEz]. Liver Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Biliary atresia (BA) is a progressive, fibro-obliterative disorder of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts in infancy. The majority of affected children will eventually develop end-stage liver disease and require liver transplantation (LT). Indications for LT in BA include failed Kasai portoenterostomy, significant and recalcitrant malnutrition, recurrent cholangitis, and the progressive manifestations of portal hypertension. Extrahepatic complications of this disease, such as hepatopulmonary syndrome and portopulmonary hypertension, are also indications for LT.

Optimal pretransplant management of these potentially life-threatening complications and maximizing nutrition and growth require the expertise of a multidisciplinary team with experience caring for BA. The timing of transplant for BA requires careful consideration of the potential risk of transplant versus the survival benefit at any given stage of disease. Children with BA often experience long wait times for transplant unless exception points are granted to reflect the severity of disease. Family preparedness for this arduous process is therefore critical.

### Prompt distinction of Alagille syndrome and biliary atresia in infants: a comparative study [^1168hVRo]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

In this study, 9 ALGS patients (64.3%, 9/14) underwent biliary exploration due to suspected BA. Among them, Patient 3 underwent Kasai portoenterostomy based on a strong suspicion of BA; however, postoperative jaundice persisted without significant improvement. Subsequent genetic analysis revealed a pathogenic JAG1 mutation, and during follow-up, the patient developed persistent pruritus and progressively exhibited the characteristic facial features of ALGS. At 7 years of age, the patient had not undergone liver transplantation, remained on ursodeoxycholic acid for systemic pruritus, and demonstrated height and weight measurements below 1–2 standard deviations for age. Based on the genetic findings and evolving clinical manifestations, the final diagnosis was revised to ALGS rather than BA.

Patients 4 and 9 died of liver failure. Three patients (Patients 5, 7, and 14) underwent liver transplantation. Patient 11 developed cirrhosis at age 2 and is being prepared for liver transplantation. The remaining seven patients are stable and regularly followed up.

All patients in the BA group underwent exploratory laparotomy. Among them, 19 patients received Kasai portoenterostomy. Of these, 6 patients eventually underwent liver transplantation due to progressive liver dysfunction and are currently under regular follow-up. Among the 9 patients who did not undergo the Kasai procedure, 3 received primary liver transplantation due to advanced liver cirrhosis (stage III–IV) at the time of diagnosis, which made them unsuitable candidates for the Kasai procedure.

### Development and post-Kasai procedure prognostic relevance of histological features for biliary atresia [^115GfR8h]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Even patients with biliary atresia (BA) who have a BA-specific staging assessment indicating mild fibrosis may experience poor outcomes. Despite early-age surgery and a mild degree of liver fibrosis, rapid postoperative liver fibrosis development was observed, which is a risk factor for poor outcomes. Pathological and laboratory analyses revealed that severe bile duct proliferation (BDP) and increased bile acid liver fibrosis (iBALF) were associated with poor prognoses.

Significantly, BDP is known to hold prognostic value in BA, with increased BDP linked to fibrosis progression. The preoperative iBALF score predicted poor outcomes for bile drainage surgery in BA patients and may warrant consideration for primary liver transplantation. The area under the curve (AUC) for prognosis was higher when BA-specific staging was combined with iBALF and severe BDP, suggesting a more appropriate method for assessing the prognosis of BA.

For patients showing poor prognostic results, Kasai surgery should be followed by close monitoring and prompt symptomatic treatment. This study was a single-center retrospective analysis, with patients collected within a narrow three-year timeframe, which may pose limitations on sample size and follow-up duration. Additionally, histology specimens might face handling, harvesting, and processing issues over the years, complicating data collection for some patients. Wedge liver biopsy may also encounter accuracy limitations and tissue sampling errors.

### Liver stiffness measurement predicts the difficulty of Kasai procedure in biliary atresia: A single center retrospective analysis of 199 patients [^111KRDTP]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

The Kasai procedure is the standard initial treatment for infants with biliary atresia. The key to performing a successful surgery is accurately removing the fibrous portal plate near the liver hilum. However, estimating surgical difficulty pre-operatively remains unclear. This study aims to design an algorithm that predicts the difficulty of the Kasai procedure using liver stiffness measurement (LSM).

- **Methods**: One hundred ninety-nine patients were included from April 2012 to December 2016. All patients were surgically diagnosed with biliary atresia. Group A comprised patients with porta hepatis retraction (the angle between the plane of the fibrous porta plate and the plane of the medial liver closest to the plate was equal to or smaller than 90°), while Group B comprised patients without porta hepatis retraction (the angle between the plane of the fibrous porta plate and the plane of the medial liver closest to the plate was greater than 90°). Liver function measurements and LSM were taken for all patients within three days before surgery.

- **Results**: The study included 19 cases in group A (9 males, 10 females) and 180 cases in group B (87 males, 93 females). LSM showed statistical differences between the two groups, with values of 28.10 (14.90) kPa versus 10.89 (7.10) kPa, P = 0.000. There was a significant relationship between LSM and operative age, TBA, AST, and GGT (P = 0.000, 0.003, 0.003, 0.012, correlation coefficients = 0.323, 0.213, 0.207, 0.179). The AUROC of LSM was 0.919. When the cutoff value was 15.15 kPa (OR = 3.989; P = 0.000), the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were diagnostically significant.

### Risk assessment of liver transplantation after Kasai portoenterostomy in children and adults [^111ZLRdf]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2023). High credibility.

Reports of liver transplantation (LT) after Kasai portoenterostomy (KPE) in adult patients with biliary atresia are scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes and investigate the risk factors of LT after KPE in both pediatric and adult patients.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed a prospective database of patients with biliary atresia who underwent LT after KPE. Eighty-nine consecutive patients were included, and risk factors for in-hospital mortality after LT were assessed.

- **Results**: The median age of the patients was 2 years (range, 0–45 years). Forty-six patients (51.7%) had a history of upper abdominal surgery after KPE. The in-hospital mortality rate was 5.6% (5 patients). Of these, 80% of patients with mortality were aged ≥ 17 years, and all patients with mortality had a history of two or more upper abdominal surgeries. In the univariate and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses, age ≥ 17 years and the number of previous upper abdominal surgeries ≥ 2 were identified as possible risk factors.

- **Conclusions**: Our study suggests that older age and multiple previous upper abdominal surgeries are important risk factors for mortality after LT following KPE. We believe that these findings will serve as indications for safe LT in future patients.

The data for this study were sourced from the National Health Insurance (NHI) Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan. This database has been extensively utilized for epidemiological research due to its high accuracy in providing information such as diagnoses and prescriptions. Implemented in 1995, Taiwan's NHI program offers comprehensive medical coverage for nearly all of the country's population of approximately 23.5 million people.

Each patient file within the NHIRD contains an encrypted personal identification number, date of birth, date of enrollment, and medical claims. These claims include diagnoses, invasive procedures, surgeries, detailed prescriptions, and laboratory and imaging items. All information is collected using encryption and stored securely in the NHIRD. The Bureau of NHI recognizes biliary atresia (BA) as a catastrophic illness. Consequently, all newly diagnosed and registered BA patients must be certified by clinicians and are entitled to receive free treatment, which includes surgery, medications, and laboratory examinations.

### Biliary atresia/neonatal cholestasis: What is in the horizon [^115VewtZ]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

Biliary atresia (BA) is a common cause of jaundice in infancy. There is increasing evidence that newborn screening with direct or conjugated bilirubin leads to earlier diagnosis. Although the Kasai portoenterostomy is the primary treatment, there are scientific advances in adjuvant therapies. As pediatric patients transition to adult care, multidisciplinary care is essential, given the complexity of this patient population.
