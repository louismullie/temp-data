## Question

The quantity " 2% of 1 " is equal to
(A) [2/100]
(B) [2/10]
(C) 2
(D) 20
(E) 200

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what "2% of 1" equals and which option matches that value. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "percent" means mathematically. Then, I should translate "2% of 1" into a multiplication expression. Next, I will perform the calculation and simplify the result. Finally, I will compare the answer to the provided choices and confirm the correct option.

> Let me first confirm the definition of percent, because if I misstate this, everything else will be off. Percent means "per hundred", so 2% is equivalent to 2 per 100, which is the fraction [2/100] or the decimal 0.02, and I should double-check that equivalence before proceeding [^05a3655e].

> Now, I will translate the phrase "2% of 1" into a mathematical operation. "Of" in this context means multiplication, so 2% of 1 is the same as 2% multiplied by 1, which I can write as [2/100] times 1 or 0.02 times 1, and I should confirm that I'm not inadvertently changing the operation to division or addition here [^05a3655e].

> Next, I should perform the calculation. Multiplying [2/100] by 1 gives [2/100], and multiplying 0.02 by 1 gives 0.02, so the result is [2/100], which is already in simplest form, and I need to ensure I'm not overcomplicating the simplification step [^05a3655e].

> Wait, let me verify the answer choices against this result. Option A is [2/100], which matches exactly what I just calculated, whereas Option B is [2/10], which is ten times larger, and Options C, D, and E are even larger by orders of magnitude, so they cannot be correct representations of 2% of 1 [^05a3655e].

> I should confirm there isn't a trick in the wording. The question is straightforward: "2% of 1", and there is no indication to interpret "of" differently or to apply any additional scaling, so the direct translation to multiplication and the resulting fraction [2/100] stand as the correct answer [^05a3655e].

> Final answer: The quantity "2% of 1" is equal to [2/100], which corresponds to Option A [^05a3655e].

---

The quantity "2% of 1" is equal to **0.02**, which is the same as **[2/100]**. Therefore, the correct answer is **(A) [2/100]**.

---

## Calculation

To calculate 2% of 1, we use the formula:

Percentage × Number = Result

Substituting the given values:

2% × 1 = 0.02

Converting 0.02 to a fraction:

0.02 = [2/100]

---

## Verification

To verify, we can convert the fraction back to a decimal:

[2/100] = 0.02

This confirms that 2% of 1 is indeed **0.02**, which is equivalent to **[2/100]**.

---

## Conclusion

The correct answer is **(A) [2/100]**.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^568cafd9]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 1 diabetes natural history and progression risk indicate that stage 1, defined by the presence of two or more autoantibodies and normoglycemia, carries a 5-year risk of developing symptomatic type 1 diabetes of ~44%. In stage 2, risk is ~60% by 2 years and ~75% within 5 years of developing a clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. A consensus group provides expert recommendations on what should be monitored and how often these factors should be monitored in individuals with presymptomatic type 1 diabetes.

### Comprehensive evidence implies a higher social cost of CO [^608a453f]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

The social cost of carbon dioxide (SC-CO₂) measures the monetized value of the damages to society caused by an incremental metric tonne of CO₂ emissions and is a key metric informing climate policy. Used by governments and other decision-makers in benefit-cost analysis for over a decade, SC-CO₂ estimates draw on climate science, economics, demography and other disciplines. However, a 2017 report by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 1 (NASEM) highlighted that current SC-CO₂ estimates no longer reflect the latest research. The report provided a series of recommendations for improving the scientific basis, transparency and uncertainty characterization of SC-CO₂ estimates. Here we show that improved probabilistic socioeconomic projections, climate models, damage functions, and discounting methods that collectively reflect theoretically consistent valuation of risk, substantially increase estimates of the SC-CO₂. Our preferred mean SC-CO₂ estimate is $185per tonne ofCO₂ ($44-$413per tCO₂: 5%-95% range, 2020 US dollars) at a near-term risk-free discount rate of 2%, a value 3.6times higher than the US government's current value of $51per tCO₂. Our estimates incorporate updated scientific understanding throughout all components of SC-CO₂ estimation in the new open-source Greenhouse Gas Impact Value Estimator (GIVE) model, in a manner fully responsive to the near-term NASEM recommendations. Our higher SC-CO₂ values, compared with estimates currently used in policy evaluation, substantially increase the estimated benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation and thereby increase the expected net benefits of more stringent climate policies.

Total NIH Investment to Launch First Drug Product Associated With Novel Targets

Total NIH costs were calculated for 86 first-to-target products as the sum of NIH costs for basic research on the target, applied research on the drug, and phased clinical trials of failed compounds. The distribution of costs is shown in Figure 2 C. After 95th percentile outlier elimination, mean (SD) NIH costs before a first-to-target product launch was $1.44 ($1.37) billion (3% discount, $1.73 [$1.66] billion; 7% discount, $2.24 [$2.18] billion; 10.5% cost of capital, $2.96 [$3.11] billion) (Table 2). Data without outlier elimination are shown in eTables 2 and 4 in Supplement 1.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to glycemic targets, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to set a goal percent time < 70 mg/dL (< 3.9 mmol/L) of < 4% (or < 1% for older adults) and a goal percent time < 54 mg/dL (< 3.0 mmol/L) of < 1% for patients using continuous glucose monitoring to prevent hypoglycemia. Deintensify or modify therapy if these goals are not met.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness thresholds — framework and updates explain that the 2014 ACC/AHA statement provided per–capita GDP–based thresholds such that an intervention with an ICER < $50 000 per QALY gained should be considered high value, $50 000 to < $150 000 (1-3x per capita GDP) per QALY gained should be considered intermediate value, and ≥ $150 000 per QALY gained should be considered low value. The World Health Organization's program suggested that costs less than 3 times the national annual GDP per capita per disability-adjusted life year averted should be considered cost-effective, whereas costs less than 1 times should be considered highly cost-effective; however, experts have argued this approach lacks theoretical justification, and World Health Organization experts now also advise against the use of per capita GDP-based cost effectiveness thresholds and instead suggest considering cost-effectiveness information alongside other contextual information in a transparent multicriterion decision process. The writing committee reviewed alternative approaches, including relying on US-based studies; for example, a health opportunity cost analysis estimated that at 2019 prices, for every $1000000 increase in health care expenditures 1860 persons were projected to become uninsured with 81 QALYs lost due to mortality and 15 QALYs lost due to morbidity, implying a cost-effectiveness threshold of $104 000 per QALY ($51 000 to $209 000 per QALY) in 2019 US dollars, and in the probabilistic analysis 40% of the simulations suggested the threshold was less than $100 000 per QALY.

### Standards for QUality improvement reporting excellence 2.0: revised publication guidelines from a detailed consensus process [^86003e26]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2016). Low credibility.

Since the publication of Standards for QUality Improvement Reporting Excellence (SQUIRE 1.0) guidelines in 2008, the science of the field has advanced considerably. In this article, we describe the development of SQUIRE 2.0 and its key components. We undertook the revision between 2012 and 2015 using (1) semistructured interviews and focus groups to evaluate SQUIRE 1.0 plus feedback from an international steering group, (2) two face-to-face consensus meetings to develop interim drafts, and (3) pilot testing with authors and a public comment period. SQUIRE 2.0 emphasizes the reporting of three key components of systematic efforts to improve the quality, value, and safety of health care: the use of formal and informal theory in planning, implementing, and evaluating improvement work; the context in which the work is done; and the study of the intervention(s). SQUIRE 2.0 is intended for reporting the range of methods used to improve health care, recognizing that they can be complex and multidimensional. It provides common ground to share these discoveries in the scholarly literature (www.squire-statement.org).

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^574078ad]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk-based referral criteria — Practice Point 2.2.1 states, "A 5-year kidney failure risk of 3%–5% can be used to determine need for nephrology referral in addition to criteria based on eGFR or urine ACR, and other clinical considerations". Figure 15 illustrates a transition from an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)-based to a risk-based approach, with risk-based criteria including "KF risk ≥ 3%–5% 5 years", "KF risk ≥ 10% 2 years", and "KF risk ≥ 40% 2 years", and eGFR-based steps such as "Transition from primary care to nephrology care", "Transition from nephrology care to interprofessional care", and "Access and transplant planning". Because "only a small fraction of the CKD population is at high risk for progression to kidney failure", those with lower risk "may be effectively managed in primary care settings with guideline-based treatments to delay CKD progression", and "Referral criteria for nephrology services that include a risk threshold of 3%–5% over 5 years have been examined retrospectively and have also been implemented respectively in several healthcare settings", with "settings within Canada and the UK" reporting these thresholds "avoided harms from nonreferral or delayed referral of those progressing to kidney failure".

### Advancing value-based medicine: why integrating functional outcomes with clinical measures is critical to our health care future [^c5702769]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

US health care spending and functional outcomes — economic context and potential impact are summarized as follows: In 2014, US national health expenditures grew 5.3% to $3 trillion, or roughly $9523 per person, and accounted for 17.5% of the gross domestic product (GDP), with 20% attributable to Medicare and about 16%, or $496 billion, to Medicaid; from 2014 to 2024, expenditures are projected to rise at an average annual rate of 5.8%. Research indicates that by focusing on functional outcomes in patient treatment, medical costs can be decreased and the quality of medical outcomes increased.

### The law of diminishing returns in clinical medicine: how much risk reduction is enough? [^29e1cf88]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The law of diminishing returns, first described by economists to explain why, beyond a certain point, additional inputs produce smaller and smaller outputs, offers insight into many situations encountered in clinical medicine. For example, when the risk of an adverse event can be reduced in several different ways, the impact of each intervention can generally be shown mathematically to be reduced by the previous ones. The diminishing value of successive interventions is further reduced by adverse consequences (eg, drug-drug, drug-disease, and drug-nutrient interactions), as well as by the total expenditures of time, energy, and resources, which increase with each additional intervention. It is therefore important to try to prioritize interventions based on patient-centered goals and the relative impact and acceptability of the interventions. We believe that this has implications for clinical practice, research, and policy.

### Investigating suspected cancer clusters and responding to community concerns: guidelines from CDC and the council of state and territorial epidemiologists [^945666c0]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Cancer cluster investigation — Step 2 decision to close or proceed to Step 3 is based on multiple factors, and to interpret the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) the health agency must assess whether there are enough cases and population for statistical stability and, in general, that the population size of a typical census tract is the smallest denominator that will allow reliable results; if the numerator allows stability, agencies should consider whether the 95% CI exclude 1.0, along with environmental contaminants, population changes, and other information beyond the SIR to estimate whether cancers represent an excess and share a common etiology. A SIR of limited magnitude that is not statistically significant with lack of known contaminant association and no increasing trend justifies closing at Step 2, whereas a statistically significant SIR of great magnitude with an increasing trend and a known contaminant argues for continuing to Step 3; example thresholds indicate that an SIR of < 2.0 with CIs surrounding or overlapping 1.0 and < 10 cases might justify closing, while an SIR of > 4 with CIs not overlapping 1.0 and ≥ 10 etiologically linked cases should encourage advancing to Step 3.

### Over-exploitation of natural resources is followed by inevitable declines in economic growth and discount rate [^714a0d64]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Choice of parameters

The parameter values used for all of the numerical simulations, which are given in the Source Data file, are within their realistic ranges. The rate of technological growth is around 1.5–2.0% year −1 in developed countries and is higher in some developing countries. In turn, the rate of growth in the yield per unit of sustainable harvest, g f, depends on the specific natural resource, where values that were considered in the literature vary from g c down to much lower (even negative) values. Next, the value of 0 ≤ a ≤ 1 (unitless) also depends on the particular system. In a fishery, for example, if non-sustainable harvest would imply catching all the fish and sustainable harvest would imply keeping the fish population size fixed, then a would be the growth rate of the fish (i.e. 2% year −1 for large fish and higher rates for smaller fish); In agriculture, sustainable management implies the use of environmentally friendly pest control methods and effective water management, which may result in a comparable crop yield (α ≲ 1), but may be more expensive (λ > 1). In turn, the ratio between c (t) and the direct costs, C 1 and C 2 (Eq. 9), determines the relative portion of c that is needed per unit of harvest. Specifically, c (and thus the ratio) is initially small but increases due to technological changes. Also, C 1 and C 2 may vary with x 1 and x 2 if the cost varies among regions (e.g. if near-shore regions are depleted, the average direct cost of harvest may increase). Next, note that 0 ≤ μ ≤ 1 (unitless) can be chosen arbitrarily by the policymaker, as it does not affect the harvest strategy and the future value of the natural resource; rather, it determines the currency unit, which, in turn, determines the relative role of the discount and the price in determining the future value of the natural resource. A reasonable choice would be the portion in the basket of goods of the natural resource (e.g. the portion of agricultural products in consumption is ~5% in the United States and is higher in various developing countries), but μ may be higher if non-market goods are incorporated. Finally, a variety of utility functions that incorporate both c and f were suggested in the literature, including the two that are used here (Eqs. B2, B10), where estimates of η vary between 1 and 3 (unitless), and suggested values for ρ varies between 0 and 3% (year −1).

### Event generation and statistical sampling for physics with deep generative models and a density information buffer [^12833aff]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

A second figure of merit is included with the goal of measuring the rate of overfitting on the training data. If any amount of overfitting occurs, the generative model is expected to not properly populate regions of phase space that are uncovered by the training data. However, given a large enough set of training data, these regions may be small and hard to identify. To test for such a phenomenon, we produce 2D histograms invs. η i ∈ [−2.5, 2.5] with a variable number of bins N bins and measure the fraction of empty bins. As N bins is increased, the histogram granularity probes the rate of overfitting in increasingly smaller regions of the phase space. The functionalso depends on the underlying probability distribution, and is thus only meaningful in comparison to the Monte Carlo equivalent. We, therefore, compute the figure of merit as

After searching the best model with respect tovs. we independently check its behavior in. The performance, indicated by both figures of merit, is better the lower the value is.

We derive our expectations for the values of δ and δ OF for 1.2 × 10 6 events by evaluating these figures of merit on MC vs. MC data. Since we only have 1.2 million events in total, we can only evaluate the figures of merit for up to 6 × 10 5 events and then extrapolate as shown in Fig. ?. We expect that an ideal generator has δ ≈ 0.0003 and δ OF ≈ 0.5 for 1.2 × 10 6 events. For δ, this value is obtained by fitting the parameters A, B, C, D to the empirically motivated functionfor values of δ obtained by evaluating the MC dataset with N = {50,000, 100,000, …, 600,000} and extrapolating to N = 120,0000 using the c u r v e _ f i t function in scipy. The expected δ OF is assumed to be roughly flat around 0.5. We select our best model by requiring δ OF ≾ 1 while minimizing δ.

### Could less Be more? Accounting for fractional-dose regimens and different number of vaccine doses when measuring the impact of the RTS, S / AS01E malaria vaccine [^5ba23d71]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The RTS, S/AS01E (RTS, S) malaria vaccine is recommended for children in malaria endemic areas. This phase 2b trial evaluates RTS, S fractional- and full-dose regimens in Ghana and Kenya.

Methods

In total, 1500 children aged 5–17 months were randomized (1:1:1:1:1) to receive RTS, S or rabies control vaccine. RTS, S groups received 2 full RTS, S doses at months 0 and 1 and either full (groups R012-20, R012-14-26) or fractional doses (one-fifth; groups Fx012-14-26, Fx017-20-32).

Results

At month 32 post-dose 1, vaccine efficacy against clinical malaria (all episodes) ranged from 38% (R012-20; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 24%-49%) to 53% (R012-14-26; 95% CI: 42%-62%). Vaccine impact (cumulative number of cases averted/1000 children vaccinated) was 1344 (R012-20), 2450 (R012-14-26), 2273 (Fx012-14-26), and 2112 (Fx017-20-32). To account for differences in vaccine volume (fractional vs full dose; post hoc analysis), we estimated cases averted/1000 RTS, S full-dose equivalents: 336 (R012-20), 490 (R012-14-26), 874 (Fx012-14-26), and 880 (Fx017-20-32).

Conclusions

Vaccine efficacy was similar across RTS, S groups. Vaccine impact accounting for full-dose equivalence suggests that using fractional-dose regimens could be a viable dose-sparing strategy. If maintained through trial end, these observations underscore the means to reduce cost per regimen thus maximizing impact and optimizing supply.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^989dcb64]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Table 2.4 — Staging of type 1 diabetes defines three stages by autoimmunity and glycemia. Stage 1 includes autoimmunity with normoglycemia and is presymptomatic, with multiple islet autoantibodies and no impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or impaired fasting glucose (IFG), normal A1C. Stage 2 includes autoimmunity with dysglycemia and is presymptomatic; diagnostic criteria include islet autoantibodies (usually multiple) plus dysglycemia defined by IFG: FPG 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L), or IGT: 2-h PG 140–199 mg/dL (7.8–11.0 mmol/L), or A1C 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol) or ≥ 10% increase in A1C. Stage 3 includes autoimmunity with overt hyperglycemia and symptomatic disease; diagnostic criteria are diabetes by standard criteria, and autoantibodies may become absent. Alternate additional stage 2 criteria used in trials are 30-, 60-, or 90-min plasma glucose on oral glucose tolerance test ≥ 200 mg/dL (≥ 11.1 mmol/L) with confirmatory testing in those aged ≥ 18 years; dysglycemia can be defined by one or more criteria.

### Once-weekly semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity [^3d584436]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

The study STEP 1 was published by John P H Wilding and colleagues in 2021 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Obesity. In the STEP 1 study, the trial question was: what is the role of once weekly semaglutide as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention in adults with overweight or obesity? In the STEP 1 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the STEP 1 study, the population was: 1961 patients (1453 female, 508 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with a BMI of ≥ 30 (or ≥ 27 with ≥ 1 weight-related coexisting condition) who did not have diabetes. The key exclusion criteria were HbA1c ≥ 6.5%, self-reported change in body weight > 5 kg (11 lbs) within 90 days before screening, previous treatment with glucose-lowering agents or any antiobesity medications within the past 90 days before screening. In the STEP 1 study, the interventions were: n = 1306 semaglutide (initiated at 0.25 mg SC once weekly for the first 4 weeks and titrated every 4 weeks to the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly by week 16, plus diet and physical activity counseling) n = 655 placebo (matching placebo once weekly plus diet and physical activity counseling). In the STEP 1 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in relative weight reduction at week 68 (14.9% vs. 2.4%; AD 12.4%, 95% CI 11.5 to 13.4). In the STEP 1 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 10% at week 68 (69.1% vs. 12%; OR 14.7, 95% CI 11.1 to 19.4) Significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a reduction in weight by ≥ 15% at week 68 (50.5% vs. 4.9%; OR 19.3, 95% CI 12.9 to 28.8) Significant increase in absolute weight reduction from baseline to week 68 (15.3 kg vs. 2.6 kg; AD 12.7 kg, 95% CI 11.7 to 13.7). In the STEP 1 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in overall adverse events. significant differences in serious adverse events (9.8% vs. 6.4%), gastrointestinal disorders (74.2% vs. 47.9%), treatment discontinuation due to gastrointestinal events (4.5% vs. 0.8%). In the STEP 1 study, the conclusion was: in patients with a BMI of ≥ 30 (or ≥ 27 with ≥ 1 weight-related coexisting condition) who did not have diabetes, semaglutide was superior to placebo with respect to relative weight reduction at week 68.

### Triaging and initial treatment in the patient with suspected type 2 diabetes [^bd39955d]. PES (2023). High credibility.

New onset diabetes triage — type 2 diabetes pathway and initial therapy specify that after the BMI check "BMI > 95%ile?", patients on this branch are to "Treat as T2D unless suspicion for T1D high" with listed type 1 diabetes risk factors ("Autoimmunity history", "Lack of FHx of T2D or gestational diabetes", and "Presence of ketones or DKA"), and "If ≥ 2 of these T1D risk factors are present, treat with insulin". Initial treatment is then determined by "HbA1c ≥ 8.5% or ketosis present": if present, start "• Start LA insulin 0.5 units/kg
- Start metformin titration"; if not present, start "Start metformin titration to 2000 mg daily".

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^3a8d8d2e]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Coupling performance measures with economic value — The current approach bases class of recommendation on the strength of clinical evidence and does not consider the intervention's economic value, whereas the economic value statement explicitly considers incremental cost-effectiveness. The authors propose continuing this separation for now, but state it is plausible that future economic value assessments may inform class of recommendation, with the Class 1 designation reserved for interventions with strong clinical evidence of health benefit that are also cost-effective at the accepted threshold. For Class 2 recommendations, economic value assessment may help determine whether an intervention receives a Class 2A designation (meets the cost-effectiveness threshold) versus a Class 2B designation (does not meet the cost-effectiveness threshold).

Rule of Seven for radiation dose rates — fallout dose rate after a detonation can be calculated and estimated as follows: "Dose rate = Initial dose rate × t⁻¹·²", and "the dose rate decreases by a factor of 10 for each sevenfold increase in time following a fission detonation"; this rule "is valid for only the first 2 weeks after a detonation", and "rain accelerates the decrease". Table values indicate percentage of initial dose rate remaining of 100% at 0 hour, 10% at 7 hours, 1% at 49 hours (2 days), and 0.1% at 343 hours (14 days).

### Inconsistency between overall and subgroup analyses [^eed221ea]. General Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

In table 3, we use numerical examples to show that if p₁ ≠ p₂ and d₁ d₂ ≠0, all combinations of 1–9 and 13 in table 2 may occur.

Table 3
Numerical examples of Δ₀, Δ₁ and Δ when p₁ ≠ p₂ and d₁ d₂ ≠0

The following theorem gives a more general sufficient condition of consistency than the first three cases discussed above.

Theorem: given Δ₀ and Δ₁, for any p₁ and p₂ between 0 and 1, there always exists a p between 0 and 1 such that Δ = Δ₀ p +Δ₁ (1− p) if and only if p₁ = p₂ or d₁ d₂ ≤ 0.

The proof of this theorem is available on request. Note that d₁ d₂ = 0 implies d₁ d₂ ≤ 0.

Unfortunately, if we are only given the information that p₁ ≠ p₂ and d₁ d₂ > 0, we cannot determine whether the inconsistency will happen. For example, combinations 1 and 3 satisfy the condition of p₁ ≠ p₂ and d₁ d₂ > 0. In combination 1, the overall difference is consistent with the subgroup differences, while it is not in combination 3.

### Size limits the sensitivity of kinetic schemes [^71d1065f]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

A different measure of sensitivity — the amplification of a fold-change in the input — provides a solution to this problem. Suppose that for some value x₀ of the input parameter x, scaling by a factor a scales the output by b, so f (a x₀) = b f (x₀). Then the quotientcan be thought of as a discrete approximation of the derivative defining the logarithmic sensitivity. And if f (x) is differentiable everywhere, then by the mean value theorem, there must be a value x * of x for whichThis means that careful measurement of any two points on the input-output curve (x versus f (x)) witnesses the (local, infinitesimal) logarithmic sensitivity somewhere. Importantly — unlike in the case of fitting to a Hill function — if error in the measurements is very low, then they are also telling us the derivative for some value of x very accurately.

Equation (25) leads us to another common definition of the effective Hill coefficient:where S₀.₉ and S₀.₁ are the values of the input variable (in our case, x) required to get 90% and 10% (respectively) of the maximum value of the output variable (in our case, f (x)). Note that (26) is like (25) with a = S₀.₉ / S₀.₁ and b = 9. It implies that somewhere between S 0.1 and S 0.9 there is a logarithmic sensitivity of H eff /2.

There is yet another common definition, specific to models of binding. Suppose x is the concentration of a ligand and 〈 n b 〉(x) is the expected number of sites bound by a ligand out of a total of n possible binding sites. It is common then, to takeor to report, as the Hill coefficient, the slope of a line fitted to x versusdata on a log-log plot.

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^293544d0]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

AHA/ACC 2025 cost/value methodology — coupling performance measures with economic value explains that the current approach to guideline development is that the class of recommendation for the clinical recommendation is based on the strength of the clinical evidence and does not consider the economic value of the intervention, whereas the economic value statement explicitly considers incremental cost-effectiveness; it proposes that guideline writing committees continue this practice for now, but notes it is plausible that in the future economic value assessments may inform class of recommendation, with the Class 1 designation reserved for interventions that have strong clinical evidence of health benefit and are also cost-effective at the accepted threshold; alternatively, when procedures or interventions receive a Class 2 recommendation (ie, probably recommended and may be appropriate for some patients), the economic value assessment may help determine whether an intervention receives a Class 2A designation (moderate benefit and meets the cost-effectiveness threshold) versus a Class 2B designation (benefit only marginally exceeds risk or does not meet the cost-effectiveness threshold); this approach would provide an incentive for stakeholders to price interventions according to the value they generate for patients and society.

### ROX (respiratory rate-OXygenation) index to predict early response to high-flow nasal cannula therapy in infants with viral bronchiolitis [^3ab76811]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is commonly used as first step respiratory support in infants with moderate-to-severe acute viral bronchiolitis (AVB). This device, however, fails to effectively manage respiratory distress in about a third of patients, and data are limited on determinants of patient response. The respiratory rate-oxygenation (ROX) index is a relevant tool to predict the risk for HFNC failure in adult patients with lower respiratory tract infections. The primary objective of this study was to assess the relationship between ROX indexes collected before and 1h after HFNC initiation, and HFNC failure occurring in the following 48h in infants with AVB.

Method

This is an ancillary study to the multicenter randomized controlled trial TRAMONTANE 2, that included 286 infants of less than 6 months with moderate-to-severe AVB. Collection of physiological variables at baseline (H0), and 1h after HFNC (H1), included heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2), respiratory distress score (modified Wood's Clinical Asthma Score [mWCAS]), and pain and discomfort scale (EDIN). ROX and ROX-HR were calculated as [(SpO₂/FiO₂)/RR] and 100 × [ROX/HR], respectively. Predefined HFNC failure criteria included increase in respiratory distress score or RR, increase in discomfort, and severe apnea episodes. The accuracies of ROX, ROX-HR indexes and clinical variable to predict HFNC failure were assessed using receiver operating curve analysis. We analyzed predictive factors of HFNC failure using multivariate logistic regressions.

Result

HFNC failure occurred in 111 of 286 (39%) infants, and for 56 (50% of the failure) of them within the first 6h. The area under the curve of ROX indexes at H0 and H1 were, respectively, 0.56 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.48–0.63, p = 0.14), 0.56 (95% CI 0.49–0.64, p = 0.09). ROX-HR performances were better but remained poorly discriminant. HFNC failure was associated with higher mWCAS score at H1 (p < 0.01) and lower decrease in EDIN scale during the first hour of HFNC delivery (p = 0.02). In the multivariate analyses, age and mWCAS score were were found to be independent factors associated with HFNC failure at H0. At H1, weight and mWCAS were associated factors.

Conclusion

In this study, neither ROX index, nor physiological variables usually collected in infants with AVB had early discriminatory capacity to predict HFNC failure.

### Use of clinical trial characteristics to estimate costs of new drug development [^945e3485]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Despite their importance to patients, health, and industry, the magnitude of investments in drug research and development (R&D) remain nebulous. New policies require more granular and transparent R&D cost estimates to better balance incentives for innovation and returns to developers.

Objective

To estimate per-drug R&D costs using a novel, reproduceable approach and to describe firm-level R&D costs per discrete unit of R&D activity (1 patient-month).

Design, Setting, and Participants

This economic evaluation used cross-sectional data to estimate 2014 to 2019 costs per patient-month. Costs per patient-month were calculated using data from 268 US publicly traded drug developers, contributing 1311 firm-year observations, that were highest ranked by assets or market capitalization, after exclusions. Per-drug costs were calculated from all R&D activity through approval for a cohort of 38 new drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2019. Data were analyzed from January 2022 to July 2024.

Exposure

R&D activity, measured in terms of clinical trial patient-months.

Main Outcomes and Measures

This study used a 2-step approach to estimate R&D costs, first allocating firm-year-level total R&D spending across similarly aggregated patient-months, and then aggregating these incremental costs to estimate drug-level R&D costs per new drug.

Results

Among 268 developers assessed, 20 large firms accounted for 80.8% of all patient-months and had 27.4% lower mean and 26.7% lower median costs per patient-month compared with other firms. Each 1% increase in patient-months was associated with a 0.9% increase in R&D costs. R&D costs per new drug were highly skewed, with a lower median (IQR), at $708 million ($247 million to $1.42 billion) than mean (SD), at $1.31 ($1.92) billion, after adjusting for the cost of capital and discontinued products. Without these adjustments, direct costs per new drug were a median (IQR) of $150 ($67.6-$453) million and a mean (SD) $369 of ($684) million. While estimated R&D costs varied in sensitivity analyses, mean costs were always substantially greater than median costs.

Conclusions and Relevance

This economic evaluation found median per-drug R&D costs toward the lower end of the range from prior studies, with a mean closer to the middle of the existing range despite the broad scope of included costs. These findings suggest parallel development across indications, adjustment for discontinued products, and a small number of expensive development programs are particularly important drivers of R&D costs.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^907bb576]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) diagnostic timeframes and staging — diagnosis uses either change in serum creatinine (SCr) within 1 week or a 0.3 mg/dl (26.5 μmol/l) increase within 48 hours (Recommendation 2.1.1). The 1-week or 48-hour periods may occur at any time and are for diagnosis, not staging; staging spans the entire episode, such that a 50% SCr increase in 5 days that ultimately reaches a three-fold increase over 3 weeks would be diagnosed as AKI and staged as Stage 3.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios: uses and pitfalls [^ff53a0ec]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Cost-effectiveness analysis is a formal method of comparing alternative medical interventions with regard to their resource utilization (costs) and outcomes (effectiveness). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is an informative measure generated from such an analysis and represents the ratio of the difference in cost between two medical interventions to the difference in outcomes between the two interventions. Thus, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio summarizes the additional cost per unit of health benefit gained in switching from one medical intervention to another. Although incremental cost-effectiveness ratios have limitations, when used in the proper context, these ratios serve as one of the important tools needed to help guide decisions about allocating scarce resources across competing medical programmes.

### Comprehensive evidence implies a higher social cost of CO [^10d3b16d]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

Estimating the SC-CO₂

We estimate the SC-CO₂ in a three-step calculation process. In the first step, we run the GIVE model out to the year 2300 for two separate cases: a 'baseline' case and a 'perturbed' case that adds an extra 0.1 MtC pulse of CO₂ emissions in the year 2020 and is otherwise identical. In the second step, we calculate marginal climate damages in year t as the difference in modelled damages per tonne between the pulse and baseline runs aswhere we aggregate over each of the four damage sectors d at their respective geographic resolutions (that is, countries or regions) r.

In the third and final step, we calculate the SC-CO₂ by discounting these marginal damages using the stochastic discount factors SDFₜ from equation (5) above and then aggregate them over time into a single present value

For our preferred results, we calculate 10,000 unique SC-CO₂ estimates. For each estimate, we sample the RFF-SP scenarios to account for uncertainties in global CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O emission trajectories in addition to country-level population and GDP growth levels. We also sample parametric uncertainties in the FaIR and BRICK models as well as the agricultural and temperature-related mortality damage functions (Extended Data Table 2). As described above, our preferred SC-CO₂ estimate uses discounting parameters of ρ = 0.2% and η = 1.24 for a near-term rate of 2%.

When we report partial SC-CO₂ estimates for a given damage sector, we follow the estimation procedure outlined above, but only include the impacts from that individual sector when calculating marginal damages in equations (7), (8). We normalize our estimates on the basis of emission pulse size and report all results throughout the paper in units of 2020 US dollars per metric tonne of CO₂. We use the implicit GDP price deflator from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis to convert values to 2020 dollars.

We typically summarize the distribution of our 10,000 SC-CO₂ estimates by its mean, that is, E [SC-CO₂], where the expectation operator is taken jointly over all uncertain parameters determining marginal damages (MDₜ) and the stochastic discount factor (SDFₜ). This calculation is consistent with economic theory for pricing investments and other actions with uncertain payoffs, and therefore properly accounts for the risk premium in the valuation of a marginal emission of CO₂ owing to the many compounding uncertainties we model.

### Comparison of sales income and research and development costs for FDA-approved cancer drugs sold by originator drug companies [^320919b5]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

High costs and risks of research and development (R&D) have been used to justify the high prices of cancer drugs. However, what the return on R&D investment is, and by extension what a justifiable price might be, is unclear.

Objective

To compare incomes from the sales of cancer drugs with the estimated R&D costs.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This observational study used global pharmaceutical industry sales data to quantify the cumulative incomes generated from the sales of cancer drugs for companies that have held patents or marketing rights (originator companies). All cancer drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration from 1989 to 2017 were identified from the United States Food and Drug Administration's website and literature. Itemized product sales data were extracted from the originator companies' consolidated financial reports. For drugs with data missing in specific years, additional data was sought from other public sources, or where necessary, estimated values from known reported values. Drugs were excluded if there were missing data for half or more of the years since approval. Data analysis was conducted from May 2018 to October 2018.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sales data were expressed in 2017 US dollars with adjustments for inflation. Cumulative incomes from the sales of these drugs were compared against the R&D costs estimated in the literature, which had been adjusted for the costs of capital and trial failure (risk adjusted).

Results

Of the 156 US Food and Drug Administration-approved cancer drugs identified, 99 drugs (63.5%) had data for more than half of the years since approval and were included in the analysis. There was a median of 10 years (range, 1–28 years) of sales data with 1040 data points, 79 (7.6%) of which were estimated. Compared with the total risk-adjusted R&D cost of $794 million (range, $2827-$219 million) per medicine estimated in the literature, by the end of 2017, the median cumulative sales income was $14.50 (range, $3.30-$55.10) per dollar invested for R&D. Median time to fully recover the maximum possible risk-adjusted cost of R&D ($2827 million) was 5 years (range, 2–10 years; n = 56). Cancer drugs continued to generate billion-dollar returns for the originator companies after the end-of-market exclusivity, particularly for biologics.

Conclusions and Relevance

Cancer drugs, through high prices, have generated returns for the originator companies far in excess of possible R&D costs. Lowering prices of cancer drugs and facilitating greater competition are essential for improving patient access, health system's financial sustainability, and future innovation.

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^4ad523f0]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Strategy Report provides clinicians with an annually updated evidence-based strategy for asthma management and prevention, which can be adapted for local circumstances (e.g., medication availability). This article summarizes key recommendations from GINA 2021, and the evidence underpinning recent changes. GINA recommends that asthma in adults and adolescents should not be treated solely with short-acting β 2 -agonist (SABA), because of the risks of SABA-only treatment and SABA overuse, and evidence for benefit of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Large trials show that as-needed combination ICS-formoterol reduces severe exacerbations by ≥ 60% in mild asthma compared with SABA alone, with similar exacerbation, symptom, lung function, and inflammatory outcomes as daily ICS plus as-needed SABA. Key changes in GINA 2021 include division of the treatment figure for adults and adolescents into two tracks. Track 1 (preferred) has low-dose ICS-formoterol as the reliever at all steps: as needed only in Steps 1–2 (mild asthma), and with daily maintenance ICS-formoterol (maintenance-and-reliever therapy, "MART") in Steps 3–5. Track 2 (alternative) has as-needed SABA across all steps, plus regular ICS (Step 2) or ICS-long-acting β 2 -agonist (Steps 3–5). For adults with moderate-to-severe asthma, GINA makes additional recommendations in Step 5 for add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists and azithromycin, with add-on biologic therapies for severe asthma. For children 6–11 years, new treatment options are added at Steps 3–4. Across all age groups and levels of severity, regular personalized assessment, treatment of modifiable risk factors, self-management education, skills training, appropriate medication adjustment, and review remain essential to optimize asthma outcomes.

### Type 2 diabetes therapies: a STEPS approach [^fc25c424]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

A concise way to evaluate pharmacotherapy options for type 2 diabetes mellitus is to use the five patient-oriented STEPS criteria: safety, tolerability, efficacy, price, and simplicity. The first-line treatment option, metformin, is safe and fairly well-tolerated, has excellent long-term efficacy for patient-oriented outcomes, is moderately priced, and has a simple dosing regimen. However, most patients with type 2 diabetes require more than one medication. The STEPS approach can help choose subsequent medications if metformin does not provide adequate glycemic control.

### SQUIRE 2.0 (standards for QUality improvement reporting excellence): revised publication guidelines from a detailed consensus process [^c5fee56c]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2016). Medium credibility.

SQUIRE 2.0 developmental path

We developed SQUIRE 2.0 between 2012 and 2015 in three overlapping phases: (1) evaluation of the initial SQUIRE guidelines, (2) early revisions and (3) pilot testing with late revisions.

We began the evaluation of SQUIRE 1.0 by collecting data to assess its clarity and usability. Semistructured interviews and focus groups with 29 end users of SQUIRE 1.0 revealed that many found SQUIRE 1.0 helpful in planning and doing improvement work, but less so in the writing process. This issue was especially apparent in the efforts to write about the cyclic, iterative process that often occurs with improvement interventions. SQUIRE 1.0 was seen by many as unnecessarily complex with too much redundancy and lacking a clear distinction between 'doing improvement' and 'studying the improvement'. A recent independent study and editorial also documented and addressed some of these challenges.

In the second phase, we convened an international advisory group of 18 experts that included editors, authors, researchers and improvement professionals. This group met through three conference calls, reviewed SQUIRE 1.0 and the results of the end-user evaluation, and provided detailed feedback on successive revisions. This advisory group and additional participants attended two consensus conferences in 2013 and 2014 where they engaged in intensive analysis and made recommendations that further guided the revision process.

In the third phase, 44 authors used an interim draft version of the updated SQUIRE guidelines to write sections of a manuscript. Each author then provided comments on the utility and understandability of the draft guidelines, and in their submitted section, identified the portions of their writing samples that fulfilled the items of that section. We also obtained detailed feedback about this draft version through semistructured interviews with 11 biomedical journal editors. The data from this phase revealed areas needing further clarification, and which specific items were prone to misinterpretation. Finally, a penultimate draft was emailed to over 450 individuals around the world, including the advisory group, consensus meeting participants, authors, reviewers, editors, faculty in fellowship programmes and trainees. This version was also posted on the SQUIRE website with an invitation for public feedback. We used the information from this process to write SQUIRE 2.0 (table 1).

### CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE METHODOLOGY: methodology [^1ca4ad94]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

ACOG clinical practice guideline development — topic selection, timeline, team composition, and grading indicate that each committee selects 2–3 new topics annually and the development process typically spans 24–36 months from initial topic selection to final publication. The process is led by a document writing team composed of committee members and subject matter experts, and Two committee members are selected to serve on the document writing team with the subject matter expert to develop the outline, synthesize evidence, propose recommendations, and author the manuscript. ACOG's guideline development process incorporates a modified GRADE framework, with recommendations classified by quality of evidence and strength of recommendation, and ungraded Good Practice Statements may be incorporated when evidence is extremely limited or nonexistent.

### Feasible future global scenarios for human life evaluations [^bb9a7e71]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Recent trends (results)

We estimate the 2P and annual models for each country, and for the world as a whole. Table 2 present the results. In general, we find excellent agreement between the 2P and annual estimates. Although the annual estimates use more observations and should therefore be more efficient, they have slightly higher standard errors, likely reflecting the short-term variation during the GFC.

Overall, the trend in life evaluations, measured as per-year change on an 11-point scale, is very small (insignificant). The material variables income and life expectancy are globally increasing significantly, according to all our specifications. There are also significant global trends in the non-material variables, whose changes are measured as annual change on a 0–1 scale. Freedom and corruption are both improving in all specifications, while social support is getting worse (diminishing), and significantly so averaged across countries. Thus, the predictor variables are significantly trending but not all in an optimistic or pessimistic direction.

Table 2 also reports, for each variable, the fraction of countries with statistically significant (p ≤ .05) rates of change. These fractions are in all cases considerably > 5%, suggesting that trends, both positive and negative, are sustained (and real). This fact is central to our argument in that it supports our assumption that we can gauge reasonable rates of change based on the distribution of changes in the recent past. The remaining rows of Table 2 show the 10th and 90th, and intermediate, percentiles from these distributions. We consider these to correspond to plausible optimistic and pessimistic trends in the future scenarios. In general, these values are more extreme for the annual model than the 2P model, and we use the latter in order to remain conservative in our scenarios.

Estimated recent global trends and distribution

The first four rows show estimated global trends for the period 2005–2016 and between the periods 2005–2007 and 2014–2016. The 2P versions of the five quantiles of the across-countries distributions are used to build our future scenarios

Table 2.
Absolute Risk of Hospitalization by 28 Days Following a Positive Test for SARS-CoV-2, Expressed as a Percentage

Case Fatality Given Hospital Admission

There were 669 deaths among people admitted to a hospital (alpha: 369 [13.6%]; wild-type: 300 [13.7%]). In fully adjusted analysis, accounting for demographic factors, regional variation, and individual-level comorbidities, alpha was associated with 44% increased hazards of death (aHR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.11–1.87; P = 0.0057) when compared with wild-type after conditioning on hospital admission (Figure 2). The increased hazard of death for alpha conditional on hospital admission was consistent across all predefined subgroups and sensitivity analyses (Supplementary Figure 2).

Among people admitted to a hospital, 615 of 4910 (12.5%) were admitted to the ICU (alpha: 344; wild-type: 271). Compared with people admitted to a hospital, those admitted to the ICU were of similar age (median age: 59.0 vs 58.0 years), with a higher proportion having 1 comorbidity (1 comorbidity: 31.5% vs 27.4%; ≥ 2 comorbidities: 19.5% vs 21.9%). Mortality among those admitted to the ICU was high (alpha: 147/344 [42.7%]; wild-type: 99/271 [36.5%]). In fully adjusted analysis, accounting for demographic factors, regional variation, and individual-level comorbidities, the association between alpha and increased mortality was smaller and the CI included the null (aHR: 1.20; 95% CI:.74–1.95; P = 0.45) compared with wild-type cases after conditioning on admission to the ICU (Figure 2).

### Biased expectations about future choice options predict sequential economic decisions [^49921c9c]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Here, we set the prior values of μ and σ² in two possible ways: objective value and subjective values versions. In some previous studies of optimal stopping for price decisions, the mean and variance of the generating distribution has been fixed in advance by the mean and variance of the distribution of objective prices. We implemented an objective values version of the Ideal Observer in this way for all the study conditions reported herein. This objective values procedure for the Ideal Observer assumes that the raw prices can be treated as a proxy for participants' subjective value of the prices, so an Ideal Observer that optimises only the raw prices when making decisions would therefore be an appropriate basis for comparison with participants. However, we also had direct access to participants' subjective values of options in some conditions (Pilot full, Study 1 full condition, Study 1 ratings condition, Study 2 and both sequence length conditions of Study 3), due to the presence of the initial rating phase, and so we could also build a subjective values version of the Ideal Observer. This second way of computing the Ideal Observer assumes that participants' subjective valuation of prices may not necessarily exactly equal the raw price values, especially in their scaling, which may be relevant to full information problems. We used each participants' individualised ratings (subjective valuations) of the prices as option values input to the subjective values version of the Ideal Observer, and we used the mean and variance of individual participants' ratings distributions when initialising the prior of the generating distribution of the Ideal Observer.

Because conditions with an initial rating phase had objective and subjective values versions of the Ideal Observer, with each version providing separate optimality estimates, we were able to test the hypotheses that the use of objective or subjective values when modelling (a) affects the strategy taken by the optimality model and (b) changes the assessment of participant bias. We ensured for both objective values and subjective values versions of the models that better options were always more positively-valued such that the models were always solving a maximisation problem. We further ensured that estimated parameters for both objective values and subjective values versions of the models would be on the same scales by reflecting the objective prices around their mean. Then we rescaled those values to span 1 (the highest/worst price) to 100 (the best price). These reflected and rescaled objective values were then used in objective values models when computing the prior generating distribution, and when inputting price values to the model as option values. Subjective values were already rated by participants on this same 1 to 100 scale.

### Long-term respiratory consequences of prematurity [^ef395afe]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Worldwide, every year 15 million children are born preterm, and prematurity is the second leading cause of death in children under 5 years of age.

The vast majority (84%) of all preterm births takes place between 32 and 37 weeks of gestation, so‐called moderate‐late prematurity, while only 1%–2% occur before 28 weeks of gestation (extreme prematurity). Respiratory consequences of preterm birth are very common and although the prevalence increases with decreasing gestational age (GA), the absolute numbers of moderate‐late preterm births are much higher, and therefore the highest burden of respiratory consequences is in moderate‐late preterm born children.

### Incorporating economic evidence in clinical guidelines: a framework from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^4483eea4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Figure 1 — comparative value of interventions — categorizes value by clinical net benefit and incremental cost for quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) with intervention versus comparator, where the incremental cost dimension reflects the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per QALY gained. For favorable clinical net benefit, higher cost corresponds to high value (< $100 000), intermediate value ($100 000 to $200 000), or low value (> $200 000) with the intervention more effective and more costly; lower cost corresponds to high value with the intervention more effective and less costly (cost-saving). For unfavorable clinical net benefit, higher cost indicates no value with the intervention less effective and more costly (cost-dominated), and lower cost indicates no value with the intervention less effective and less costly.

### New designs for phase 2 clinical trials [^a90544dc]. Blood (2003). Low credibility.

Conventional phase 2 clinical trials are typically single-arm experiments, with outcome characterized by one binary "response" variable. Clinical investigators are poorly served by such conventional methodology. We contend that phase 2 trials are inherently comparative, with the results of the comparison determining whether to conduct a subsequent phase 3 trial. When different treatments are studied in separate single-arm trials, actual differences between response rates associated with the treatments, "treatment effects", are confounded with differences between the trials, "trial effects". Thus, it is impossible to estimate either effect separately. Consequently, when the results of separate single-arm trials of different treatments are compared, an apparent treatment difference may be due to a trial effect. Conversely, the apparent absence of a treatment effect may be due to an actual treatment effect being cancelled out by a trial effect. Because selection involves comparison, single-arm phase 2 trials thus fail to provide a reliable means for selecting which therapies to investigate in phase 3. Moreover, reducing complex clinical phenomena, including both adverse and desirable events, to a single outcome wastes important information. Consequently, conventional phase 2 designs are inefficient and unreliable. Given the limited number of patients available for phase 2 trials and the increasing number of new therapies that must be evaluated, it is critically important to conduct these trials efficiently. These concerns motivated the development of a general paradigm for randomized selection trials evaluating several therapies based on multiple outcomes. Three illustrative applications of trials using this approach are presented.

### Estimated costs of pivotal trials for novel therapeutic agents approved by the US food and drug administration, 2015–2016 [^f5e4a0af]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

A critical question in health care is the extent of scientific evidence that should be required to establish that a new therapeutic agent has benefits that outweigh its risks. Estimating the costs of this evidence of efficacy provides an important perspective.

Objective

To estimate costs and assess scientific characteristics of pivotal efficacy trials that supported the approval of new therapeutic agents by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from 2015 to 2016.

Design and Setting

This study identified 59 novel therapeutic drugs using the annual summary reports from the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. ClinicalTrials.gov, FDA reviews, and peer-reviewed publications that were publicly available in 2017 were used to identify 52 characteristics of each efficacy trial. Costs were calculated with a global clinical trial cost assessment tool available to contract research organizations and pharmaceutical sponsors.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Estimated mean cost and 95% CIs based on industry benchmark data from 60 countries. Measures of trials' scientific characteristics included trial design (no control group, placebo, and active drug), end point (surrogate outcome, clinical scale, and clinical outcome), patient enrollment, and treatment duration.

Results

A total of 138 pivotal clinical trials provided the basis for approval of 59 new therapeutic agents by the FDA from 2015 to 2016, with a median estimated cost of $19.0 million (interquartile range, $12.2 million-$33.1 million). Estimated costs ranged from less than $5 million for trials without a control group for 3 orphan drugs with fewer than 15 patients each to $346.8 million (95% CI, $252.0 million-$441.5 million) for a noninferiority trial with end points assessing clinical benefit. Twenty-six of 138 trials (18.8%) were uncontrolled, with a mean estimated cost of $13.5 million (95% CI, $10.1 million-$16.9 million). Trials designed with placebo or active drug comparators had an estimated mean cost of $35.1 million (95% CI, $25.4 million-$44.8 million). Costs also varied by trial end point, treatment duration, patient enrollment, and therapeutic area.

Conclusions and Relevance

The highest-cost trials were those in which the new agent had to be proved to be noninferior with clinical benefit end points compared with an agent already available or those that required larger patient populations to achieve statistical power to document smaller treatment effects or accrue infrequently occurring end points.

### Screening for gestational diabetes: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^7d112a15]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF response to public comment — screening tests, timing, and scope: A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from February 16 through March 15, 2021. The USPSTF found that several screening tests (OGCT, OGTT, fasting plasma glucose) and strategies (1- vs 2-step approach) can accurately detect gestational diabetes and does not recommend any single specific test, and based on newer evidence, the USPSTF found no difference between a 1-step and 2-step screening strategy for many maternal or infant outcomes. The USPSTF found limited data on risk-based screening and limited data on the benefits and harms of screening before 24 weeks of gestation, and clarifies that the recommendations do not preclude later screening. The USPSTF notes that detection and management of preexisting diabetes during pregnancy is beyond the scope of this recommendation, and clinicians should continue to use their clinical judgment to determine if screening is appropriate for individual patients.

### Semaglutide 2.4 mg for the treatment of obesity: key elements of the STEP trials 1 to 5 [^90eec8d2]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The obesity epidemic is a public health concern, warranting further research into pharmacological treatments for weight management (WM) as an adjunct to lifestyle interventions. The Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity (STEP) program aims to investigate the effect of semaglutide versus placebo on weight loss, safety, and tolerability in adults with obesity or overweight.

Methods

Across five phase 3 trials (NCT03548935, WM; NCT03552757, WM in type 2 diabetes; NCT03611582, WM with intensive behavioral therapy; NCT03548987, sustained WM; and NCT03693430, long-term WM), ~5,000 participants are being randomly assigned to receive semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly subcutaneously versus placebo. Results will be available in 2020/2021. For all trials, the primary end point is change from baseline to end of treatment in body weight.

Results

Participants have a mean age of 46.2 to 55.3 years, are mostly female (mean: 74.1%-81.0%), and have a mean BMI of 35.7 to 38.5 kg/m 2 and a mean waist circumference of 113.0 to 115.7 cm.

Conclusions

The STEP program evaluates the efficacy and safety of semaglutide 2.4 mg subcutaneously once weekly in a broad population. The trials will provide insights on WM in people with obesity with and without type 2 diabetes and on long-term follow-up.

### An overview of phase 2 clinical trial designs [^bf52c5c8]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical trials are studies to test new treatments in humans. Typically, these treatments are evaluated over several phases to assess their safety and efficacy. Phase 1 trials are designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a new treatment, typically with a small number of patients (eg, 20–80), generally spread across several dose levels. Phase 2 trials are designed to determine whether the new treatment has sufficiently promising efficacy to warrant further investigation in a large-scale randomized phase 3 trial, as well as to further assess safety. These studies usually involve a few hundred patients. This article provides an overview of some of the most commonly used phase 2 designs for clinical trials and emphasizes their critical elements and considerations. Key references to some of the most commonly used phase 2 designs are given to allow the reader to explore in more detail the critical aspects when planning a phase 2 trial. A comparison of 3 potential designs in the context of the NRG-HN002 trial is presented to complement the discussion about phase 2 trials.

### Mitigation of SARS-CoV-2 transmission at a large public university [^75683b02]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Evaluating the multiplier, M, for testing frequency

We adopted the following infectiousness profile, after Goyal et al. (2020), which includes 2-day latency period of [0.0, 0.0, 0.148, 1.0, 0.823, 0.426, 0.202, 0.078, 0.042, 0.057, 0.009, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. The sum of this infectiousness list is therefore 2.785. The effect of testing frequency on reducing the transmission chain may be estimated as follows:
A. Testing once a week: With one test a week, agents may test positive and get isolated on days 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 after exposure with a probability = 1/7. Therefore, the expected sum of infectiousness profile modulated by 1 test a week is (1/7)*0.148 + (1/7)*(0.148 + 1.0) + (1/7)*(0.148 + 1.0+0.823) + (1/7)*(0.148 + 1.0 + 0.823 + 0.426) + (1/7) * (0.148 + 1.0 + 0.823 + 0.426 + 0.202) + (1/7)*(0.148 + 1.0 + 0.823 + 0.426 + 0.202 + 0.078) + (1/7)*(0.148 + 1.0 + 0.823 + 0.426 + 0.202 + 0.078 + 0.042) = 1.951. This generates a R₀ multiplier = 1.951/2.785 = 70.5%.
B. Testing two times a week: With two tests a week, agents may test positive and get isolated on days 3, 4, or 5 after exposure with a probability = 2/7, while agents may test positive and get isolated 5.5 days after exposure with a probability = 1/7. Therefore, the expected sum of infectiousness profile modulated by 2 tests a week is (2/7)*0.148 + (2/7)*(0.148 + 1.0) + (2/7)*(0.148 + 1.0 + 0.823) + (1/7)*(0.148 + 1.0 + 0.823 + 0.426/2) = 1.245, generating a R₀ multiplier = 1.245/2.785 = 44.7%.

### The timescale and direction of influence of a third inferior alternative in human value-learning [^eb7260f5]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Basic performance

During the learning phase (Fig. 2B), participants were sequentially exposed to the value associated with each alternative. The value was shown by a cloud of moving dots, with the number of dots representing the reward magnitude (i.e. number of points) associated with the coin (see "Methods" section). Participants completed 99.91% (95% CI = [99.84%, 99.97%]) of all learning trials with an average reaction time of 623.66 milliseconds (ms) (95% CI = [593.56 ms, 653.76 ms]) in Experiment 1, and 99.3% (95% CI = [98.94%, 99.66%]) of all learning trials with an average reaction time of 411.92 ms (95% CI = [386.66 ms, 437.18 ms]) in Experiment 2, indicating that they properly engaged with the learning phase. We found no statistically significant evidence for differences between the reaction times across learning trials that involved the higher-value (HV), lower-value (LV), and distractor value (DV) alternatives across different contexts in either experiment (2-way ANOVA on log (RT) in Experiment 1: alternatives: F (2, 174) = 0.004, p = 0.99, partial η² < 0.01, 95% CI = [0.00, 0.02], contexts: F (1, 174) = 0.15, p = 0.69, partial η² < 0.01, 95% CI = [0.00, 0.03], interaction: F (2, 174) = 0.02, p = 0.98, partial η² = 0.00, 95% CI = [0.00, 0.02]; and in Experiment 2: alternatives: F (2, 402) = 0.03, p = 0.97, partial η² = 0.00, 95% CI = [0.00, 0.01], contexts: F (1, 402) = 0.06, p = 0.81, partial η² < 0.01, 95% CI = [0.00, 0.01], interaction: F (2, 402) = 0.04, p = 0.97, partial η² < 0.01, 95% CI = [0.00, 0.01]).

### Effects of once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg on C-reactive protein in adults with overweight or obesity (STEP 1, 2, and 3): exploratory analyses of three randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials [^5f196546]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Inflammation is a key driver of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. C-reactive protein (CRP), an established biomarker of inflammation, is commonly elevated in people with overweight/obesity.

Methods

STEP 1, 2, and 3 were 68-week, placebo-controlled trials of semaglutide for weight management in participants with overweight/obesity, with (STEP 2) or without (STEP 1 and 3) type 2 diabetes. Change in serum CRP from baseline to week 68 was assessed as a prespecified secondary endpoint for semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo (STEP 1, 2, and 3) and versus semaglutide 1.0 mg (STEP 2). Post hoc assessments included change in CRP by baseline characteristics (bodyweight, body mass index [BMI], glycaemic status, CRP concentration); change in CRP-defined cardiovascular risk category (< 1 [low], 1–3 [intermediate], and > 3 mg/L [high]); and correlation between change in CRP and change in bodyweight, waist circumference, fasting serum insulin (STEP 1 and 3), fasting plasma glucose, and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR).

Findings

The trials took place from June through November 2018 (STEP 1 and 2) and from August 2018 to April 2020 (STEP 3). In all trials, semaglutide 2.4 mg reduced CRP at week 68 versus placebo (estimated treatment difference [ETD; 95% CI] -44% [-49 to -39] in STEP 1, -39% [-46 to -30] in STEP 2, and -48% [-55 to -39] in STEP 3; all p < 0.05). In STEP 2, CRP reductions were greater with semaglutide 2.4 mg (-49%) than with 1.0 mg (-42%) but the difference did not reach statistical significance (ETD [95% CI] -12% [-23 to 1]; p = 0.06). Reductions in CRP occurred in parallel with bodyweight loss and were consistent regardless of baseline BMI/bodyweight/glycaemic status. More semaglutide-treated participants had reductions in CRP-defined cardiovascular risk versus those on placebo. Reductions in CRP were positively correlated with reductions in bodyweight, waist circumference, fasting plasma glucose, fasting serum insulin, and HOMA-IR (data not shown).

Interpretation

In people with overweight/obesity, once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg and 1.0 mg reduced CRP concentration irrespective of baseline BMI/bodyweight/glycaemic status compared with placebo. These data suggest a potential anti-inflammatory role of semaglutide in obesity.

### Health care clinicians and product promotion by industry [^bf8def3e]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Health care clinician–industry financial relationships — marketing expenditures and Open Payments metrics — include marketing spending and payments directed to clinicians. In 2016, pharmaceutical companies spent $29.9 billion on marketing, of which $20.3 billion (68%) was directed toward health care clinicians in the form of prescriber detailing ($5.6 billion), free samples ($13.5 billion), direct physician payments related to specific drugs ($979 million), and disease education ($59 million). Data collected by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under the Open Payments program revealed that, in 2019, 615 000 physicians received payments or investment interests worth $3.6 billion (an average of $5854 per physician recipient), and 1194 teaching hospitals accepted payments totaling $2.63 billion. Payments are highest among the medical and surgical specialties, and although 90% of physicians who accepted payments between 2014 and 2018 received less than $10 000, 3.4% of physicians who accepted payments received more than $50 000. Studies have reported that an average of approximately $61 000 was spent per physician in the United States in 2004, and that amount has decreased between 2006 and 2010.

### Validation of clinical classification schemes for predicting stroke: results from the national registry of atrial fibrillation [^631dceda]. JAMA (2001). Excellent credibility.

The clinical calculator "CHADS₂ score for stroke risk in atrial fibrillation" for atrial fibrillation, acute ischemic stroke, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, transient ischemic attack and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.

The CHADS₂ score is a clinical prediction rule for estimating the risk of stroke in patients with non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation (AF), a common and serious heart rhythm disturbance. This score is simple and has been validated by many studies in different groups of AF patients.

The CHADS₂ acronym stands for Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age ≥ 75 years, Diabetes mellitus, and prior Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Each factor scores one point, except for prior stroke or TIA, which scores two points. The total score ranges from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating a greater risk of stroke.

The clinical utility of the CHADS₂ score is to help clinicians decide whether or not to anticoagulate a patient with AF. Patients with a score of 0 are at low risk and do not require anticoagulation. Patients with a score of 1 can be considered for anticoagulation, and those with a score of 2 or more should definitely be anticoagulated, unless contraindicated.

The CHADS₂ score should not be used in patients with rheumatic AF, valvular heart disease, or those who have a contraindication to antico

The CHADS₂ score is widely used to estimate stroke risk in individuals with atrial fibrillation by evaluating five specific risk factors. Each factor contributes a designated number of points, and their combined total offers an assessment of stroke likelihood.

For the CHADS₂ score calculation, consider the following risk factors, each assigned a set point value:

- **Age 75 years or older**: 1 point
- **Hypertension**: 1 point
- **Diabetes mellitus**: 1 point
- **Congestive heart failure**: 1 point
- **History of stroke or transient ischemic attack**: 2 points

To compute the score, determine if each condition is present. Assign points based on the presence (true) of these conditions and sum the points for a total score ranging from 0 to 6. This total score then assists health professionals in the decision-making process regarding anticoagulation therapy.

Once you have the total score, assess the risk of stroke by interpreting the score as follows:

- If the score is 0, the annual stroke risk is approximately 1.9%.
- A score of 1 equates to a 2.8% risk.
- A score of 2 suggests a 4.0% risk.
- A score of 3 indicates a 5.9% risk.
- A score of 4 corresponds to an 8.5% risk.
- A score of 5 translates to a 12.5% risk.
- A score of 6 represents an 18.2% risk.

This scoring system not only provides a numeric assessment but also aids in evaluating the necessity of preventive treatment to reduce stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation.

### Waste in the US health care system: estimated costs and potential for savings [^46c55d01]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The United States spends more on health care than any other country, with costs approaching 18% of the gross domestic product (GDP). Prior studies estimated that approximately 30% of health care spending may be considered waste. Despite efforts to reduce overtreatment, improve care, and address overpayment, it is likely that substantial waste in US health care spending remains.

Objectives

To estimate current levels of waste in the US health care system in 6 previously developed domains and to report estimates of potential savings for each domain.

Evidence

A search of peer-reviewed and "gray" literature from January 2012 to May 2019 focused on the 6 waste domains previously identified by the Institute of Medicine and Berwick and Hackbarth: failure of care delivery, failure of care coordination, overtreatment or low-value care, pricing failure, fraud and abuse, and administrative complexity. For each domain, available estimates of waste-related costs and data from interventions shown to reduce waste-related costs were recorded, converted to annual estimates in 2019 dollars for national populations when necessary, and combined into ranges or summed as appropriate.

Findings

The review yielded 71 estimates from 54 unique peer-reviewed publications, government-based reports, and reports from the gray literature. Computations yielded the following estimated ranges of total annual cost of waste: failure of care delivery, $102.4 billion to $165.7 billion; failure of care coordination, $27.2 billion to $78.2 billion; overtreatment or low-value care, $75.7 billion to $101.2 billion; pricing failure, $230.7 billion to $240.5 billion; fraud and abuse, $58.5 billion to $83.9 billion; and administrative complexity, $265.6 billion. The estimated annual savings from measures to eliminate waste were as follows: failure of care delivery, $44.4 billion to $97.3 billion; failure of care coordination, $29.6 billion to $38.2 billion; overtreatment or low-value care, $12.8 billion to $28.6 billion; pricing failure, $81.4 billion to $91.2 billion; and fraud and abuse, $22.8 billion to $30.8 billion. No studies were identified that focused on interventions targeting administrative complexity. The estimated total annual costs of waste were $760 billion to $935 billion and savings from interventions that address waste were $191 billion to $286 billion.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this review based on 6 previously identified domains of health care waste, the estimated cost of waste in the US health care system ranged from $760 billion to $935 billion, accounting for approximately 25% of total health care spending, and the projected potential savings from interventions that reduce waste, excluding savings from administrative complexity, ranged from $191 billion to $286 billion, representing a potential 25% reduction in the total cost of waste. Implementation of effective measures to eliminate waste represents an opportunity reduce the continued increases in US health care expenditures.

### Glycemic goals and hypoglycemia: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^3f7aba96]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diabetes — definition and classification of hypoglycemia describes that hypoglycemia is often the major limiting factor in the glycemic management of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, with Level 1 hypoglycemia defined as a measurable glucose concentration < 70 mg/dL (< 3.9 mmol/L) and ≥ 54 mg/dL (≥ 3.0 mmol/L), and a blood glucose concentration of 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) recognized as a threshold for adrenergic responses to falling glucose in people without diabetes. Level 2 hypoglycemia is defined as a blood glucose concentration < 54 mg/dL [< 3.0 mmol/L] and is the threshold at which neuroglycopenic symptoms begin to occur and requires immediate action to resolve hypoglycemia. Symptoms of hypoglycemia include, but are not limited to, shakiness, irritability, confusion, tachycardia, sweating, and hunger.

### Two-year effects of semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity: the STEP 5 trial [^0f9f2fa2]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In STEP 5, once-weekly treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg as an adjunct to behavioral intervention in adults with overweight (with at least one weight-related comorbidity) or obesity led to a substantial initial reduction in weight, which plateaued after approximately week 60 and was maintained for the remainder of the study. At week 104, participants in the semaglutide group had achieved a mean weight loss of 15.2% from baseline — a difference of 12.6 percentage points versus placebo plus behavioral intervention. This weight loss is comparable to the mean reduction of 14.9% (placebo-corrected weight loss of 12.4 percentage points) seen at week 68 in the STEP 1 trial of semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo (both plus behavioral intervention). Thus, our findings indicate that the substantial weight losses reported during 68 weeks' treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg in prior STEP trials, can be maintained with continued semaglutide treatment up to at least 104 weeks. The mean weight loss of ~15% achieved with semaglutide 2.4 mg at week 104 in STEP 5 exceeds weight loss reported at similar time points in trials with other pharmacotherapies for weight management in adults with overweight or obesity –.

Weight loss of ≥ 5%, a threshold widely used to indicate a clinically meaningful response to therapy, was achieved by > 75% of participants in the semaglutide group at week 104. Moreover, 61.8% of participants on semaglutide lost ≥ 10% of baseline weight, and over a third of participants had achieved at least 20% weight loss at week 104 in the semaglutide group. As was seen in prior studies, while the vast majority of participants receiving semaglutide 2.4 mg had lost weight at the end of the STEP 5 study, a small proportion of participants experienced weight gain. We do not know how weight would have changed in these participants had they not been receiving the drug; notably, the proportion of patients with weight gain during the study was substantially higher in the placebo group. There is marked variability in weight change in patients on weight management treatments; the reason for this is still unclear and likely involves complex biological and societal influences.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: bladder cancer, version 3.2024 [^bc03cb74]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for bladder cancer - NCCN, more specifically with respect to histopathology, NCCN 2024 guidelines recommend to ensure the following in the pathology report on biopsy/TURBT specimens:

- include items listed in the College of American Pathologists Cancer Protocol for reporting results (tumor site, histologic subtype, histologic grade, tumor extent, and lymphovascular invasion if present). Example: Urinary bladder, tumor, Transurethral resection, High-grade urothelial carcinoma, Carcinoma infiltrates lamina propria, Muscularis propria present with invasion by tumor, Lymphovascular space invasion present, pT2

- **For tumors with intratumoral grade heterogeneity**: classify tumors as high grade if the high-grade component represents > 5% of the tumor. Classify the tumor descriptively as "low grade with < 5% high-grade component" if the high-grade component is < 5%, as these may have a prognosis that is closer to low-grade tumors

- detail if muscularis propria (detrusor muscle) is present or absent (in addition to describing if invasion is present as per the reporting protocol)

- describe if adjacent urothelial carcinoma in situ is present

- grade urothelial carcinomas with an inverted growth pattern similar to the system for papillary tumors as described above

- specify the types and percentage of the neuroendocrine components present for mixed neuroendocrine carcinoma of the bladder

- attempt to describe the extent of lamina propria invasion as early invasion/microinvasion or more extensive invasion, in addition to presence or absence of lamina propria invasion. The exact method for characterizing early invasion versus more extensive invasion of lamina propria has not been defined/optimized; however, any of the following methods could be used as detailed in the 8th edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual: < 1 high power field or greatest invasive tumor diameter of ≤ 1 mm or invasive tumor above muscularis mucosae extending to a depth of ≤ 2 mm.

ratios, proportions, and rates. All three frequency measures have the same basic form: n Recall that: 10 0 = 1 10 1 = 10. 10 2 = 10 × 10 = 100 10 3 = 10 × 10 × 10 = 1, 000 So the fraction of can be multiplied by 1, 10, 100, 1000, and so on. This multiplier varies by measure and will be addressed in each section. Ratio Definition of ratio A ratio is the relative magnitude of two quantities or a comparison of any two values. It is calculated by dividing one interval- or ratio-scale variable by the other. The numerator and denominator need not be related. Therefore, one could compare apples with oranges or apples with number of physician visits. Method for calculating a ratio etc. in one group Number or rate of events, items, persons, etc.

in another group After the numerator is divided by the denominator, the result is often expressed as the result "to one" or written as the result ":
1". n = 104 = 10, 000. Then the ratio becomes:
0. 000125 × 10, 000 = 1. 25 clinics per 10, 000 persons You could also divide each value by

1. 25, and express this ratio as 1 clinic for every 8, 000 persons. Method for calculating a proportion particular characteristic Total number of persons or events, of which the numerator is a subset n For a proportion, 10 n is usually 100 and is often expressed as a percentage. EXAMPLE: Calculating a Proportion Example A: Calculate the proportion of men in the NHANES follow-up study who were diabetics. Numerator = 189 diabetic men Denominator = Total number of men = 189 + 3, 151 = 3, 340 Proportion = × 100 = 5. 66%.
- A proportion can be expressed as a fraction, a decimal, or a percentage.

The statements "one fifth of the residents became ill" and "twenty percent of the residents became ill" are equivalent.

### Drugs that may cause or exacerbate heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^d143e9aa]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Anthracycline cardiotoxicity — pediatric populations — reported AHF incidence ranges from "0% to 16%". In a cohort of "830 pediatric cancer survivors" with "a mean follow-up time of 8.5 years", the cumulative AHF incidence was "2.5%", with estimated risks of "2% (95% CI, 1–3) at 2 years", "2.4% (95% CI, 1.3–3.5) after 5 years", "2.6% (95% CI, 1–4.3) after 10 years", "3.7% (95% CI, 1.8–5.5) after 15 years", and "5.5% (95% CI, 1.5–9.5) after 20 years". Cumulative doses " > 300 mg/m²" were an independent risk factor "(RR = 8)", increasing 20‑year risk to "9.8% (95% CI, 2.2–17.4)". A meta-analysis of "30 studies including 12 507 pediatric patients" found doses " > 45 mg/m²" within 1 week independently predictive of AHF, with frequency "predicted to be 5.8% higher" versus lower weekly doses. "Pediatric cancer survivors require lifelong cardiac monitoring because anthracycline toxicity can manifest ≥ 20 years after therapy".

### Over-exploitation of natural resources is followed by inevitable declines in economic growth and discount rate [^a112dacb]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Fig. 2
Over-harvesting extends the period during which the discount rate is high, but it is followed by sharp declines in the discount rate and the cumulative discount. Panels a and b demonstrate the optimal harvest of the natural resource from a social planner's perspective, where the natural resource and the other goods are either non-substitutable (a, Eq. B2) or partially substitutable (b, Eq. B10). In the early stages, harvesting activity increases exponentially and the discount rate is high. Approximately at time t 0, when harvesting is occurring in the whole system (H s + H n = x 1 + x 2), the total harvest stops increasing and the discount rate decreases. Next, panels c and d demonstrate harvesting in a competitive market in which some of the regions are shared. The parameters and utility functions used in panels c and d are identical to those used in panels a and b, respectively. The period during which the discount rate is high is extended until t = t 1 due to over-harvesting of the natural resource in the shared regions (compare panel a with panel c, and compare panel b with panel d). However, this period is followed by a rebound in which harvesting declines and the discount rate and the cumulative discount drop. In addition, around t = t 1, the price of the natural resource increases and the total product decreases. Note that, in accordance with the theorem, the cumulative discount approaches lower values if the harvest is determined by the market. Scaling: the harvest rates are given in (years) −1, the total non-degraded areas are given in units showing the maximal annual sustainable yield (ax 1 and ax 2), and Δ is given by 100 times the value on the y -axis. The parameter values used are within their realistic ranges (Methods). Parameter values and Source data are provided as a Source Data file
