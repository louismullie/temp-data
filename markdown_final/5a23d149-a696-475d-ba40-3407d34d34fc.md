## Question

How to diagnose strep and manage

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to diagnose and manage streptococcal pharyngitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical presentation and pretest probability. Then, I should verify how to apply validated clinical decision rules and when they fail. Next, I will review diagnostic testing strategies, including RADT, culture, and molecular assays, and reconcile conflicting guidance. After that, I need to interpret results and decide on treatment thresholds. Then, I will select antibiotics and supportive care, including special populations and stewardship. Finally, I should plan follow-up, address complications, and consider system-level quality and stewardship issues, making sure I double-check each step against current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical picture and pretest probability, because this frames all downstream decisions. Classic features that raise suspicion for group A streptococcus include abrupt sore throat, fever, tonsillar exudates or swelling, tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, and absence of cough, with cough, rhinorrhea, hoarseness, and oral ulcers pointing toward viral etiologies, and the highest prevalence in children 5–15 years and lower in adults, which aligns with CDC and AAFP summaries and the epidemiology in IDSA/ASM laboratory guidance [^115fzMKu] [^112BrrDu] [^112EViFE]. Hold on, I should verify the age nuance: under 3 years, GAS is uncommon and testing is generally not recommended, which is consistent with IDSA and CDC guidance, so I need to ensure I do not over-test very young children unless there are special risk factors or epidemiologic clues [^112GBrZo] [^112ACtFT].

> Next, I should review validated clinical decision rules and their limitations. The Modified Centor/McIsaac score adds age to the classic Centor criteria and yields a 0–5 score that stratifies risk and guides testing rather than empiric treatment, with 0–1 low risk, 2–3 intermediate, and 4–5 high risk, though I need to remember that even a score of 4–5 does not equal a confirmed diagnosis and warrants testing rather than automatic antibiotics in most settings [^113u6iB7] [^117P3DY1]. Wait, let me verify calibration: pooled analyses show the Centor/McIsaac rule has reasonable specificity but only modest positive likelihood, so in low-prevalence settings the positive predictive value is limited, reinforcing the need for microbiologic confirmation before antibiotics in most patients [^116z9sdu] [^114Vz68L]. I should also note that some European guidelines de-emphasize testing in low-risk presentations and focus on severe symptoms, which explains why recommendations diverge across regions [^111Ttea5] [^111oj5uS].

> I will now examine the diagnostic testing strategy, and I need to reconcile conflicting guidance. IDSA recommends RADT for most symptomatic patients with pharyngitis, with culture backup for negative RADTs in children and adolescents, whereas AAFP supports using a validated clinical decision rule and testing intermediate/high-risk patients, and ESCMID suggests selective RADT use in those with higher Centor scores and does not recommend routine culture backup after negative RADT in low-risk settings [^1135UNVK] [^117FtXKa] [^115dgucv] [^1126sEei] [^114hZBTx]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: the rationale for culture backup in children is the higher pretest probability and the public health relevance of preventing rheumatic fever, which remains a key driver in North American guidance, whereas in low-incidence settings some European guidelines accept the trade-off of fewer cultures to reduce delays and costs [^1135UNVK] [^111oj5uS]. I should double-check test performance: modern RADTs have high specificity around 96% but sensitivity around 86%, and molecular NAATs can achieve sensitivity comparable to culture with rapid turnaround, which is why some laboratories and clinicians are moving toward NAAT-first workflows, though guidelines have been slow to fully endorse this shift pending stewardship frameworks [^115Zdgvd] [^11412YyT] [^115xKwGu].

> Let me think about specimen quality and operational realities, because these can undermine even good tests. Optimal swabbing between the tonsillar pillars and behind the uvula, avoiding tongue and buccal mucosa, and prompt transport in appropriate media are critical; delays and suboptimal technique can lower culture sensitivity and lead to false negatives, which is why dual swabs or NAATs can mitigate missed positives in real-world workflows [^115HMXBa]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought culture sensitivity was uniformly 90–95%, but real-world performance can be lower due to preanalytic variables, which strengthens the case for NAATs where available and reinforces the need for backup strategies when RADTs are negative in children [^115HMXBa] [^11412YyT].

> Now I should interpret results and decide on treatment thresholds. If RADT is positive, I should treat confirmed GAS; if RADT is negative in a child or adolescent, I should obtain a backup culture and treat only if the culture is positive, ideally with a system to notify families when results return, given the 24–48 hour lag [^117FtXKa] [^112ACtFT]. For adults with a negative RADT, routine culture backup is not required in low-incidence settings, but I need to ensure that patients with high pretest probability or worsening symptoms are re-evaluated, and I should consider culture selectively when suspicion remains high or complications emerge [^1128DuC8] [^115WSrmn]. But wait, what if the Centor/McIsaac score is 4–5 and the RADT is negative? The residual risk can still be around 15%, so shared decision-making about empiric therapy versus culture is reasonable, especially if the patient values rapid symptom relief and accepts the risk of overtreatment [^114EJvDZ].

> Next, I should review first-line antibiotic choices and durations, and I need to ensure I anchor on narrow-spectrum agents. Penicillin V for 10 days remains the reference standard, with amoxicillin equally effective and often preferred for palatability, particularly in children; both agents have no documented resistance in GAS, which supports their primacy [^115H7z7h] [^116eLGvN]. Hold on, I should verify alternatives: for nonanaphylactic penicillin allergy, a first-generation cephalosporin for 10 days is appropriate; for anaphylactic allergy, clindamycin or a macrolide can be used, though macrolide resistance varies and should be considered in local antibiograms, and azithromycin 5-day regimens are acceptable but may have more adverse events than amoxicillin in some pediatric comparisons [^115d74AE] [^114AaBsW]. I need to ensure duration is adequate for eradication; 10 days is standard, and although once-daily amoxicillin has been used, I should confirm local guidance before deviating from the 10-day course [^115H7z7h].

> I should confirm supportive care recommendations and avoid overtreatment. NSAIDs are effective for pain and fever, acetaminophen is reasonable when NSAIDs are contraindicated, and medicated throat lozenges can provide additional symptomatic relief; corticosteroids are not routinely recommended for GAS pharyngitis despite small symptom benefits, so I should reserve them for exceptional cases after weighing risks [^113Le879] [^111VdEoF]. I need to ensure I counsel on hydration, rest, and return precautions for airway symptoms or persistent fever, and I should avoid aspirin in children due to Reye syndrome risk [^114kQUTD].

> Special populations and stewardship considerations require careful attention. In children under 3 years, testing is generally not indicated unless there are epidemiologic links or classic features, given the rarity of rheumatic fever in this age group, so I should avoid reflex testing in this cohort [^112GBrZo] [^112ACtFT]. For asymptomatic household contacts, I should not test or treat, as carriage is common and not associated with transmission or complications, which helps curb unnecessary antibiotics [^113QZa4G] [^111Dfgup]. Let me reconsider recurrent infections: if a child has frequent episodes, I should distinguish true recurrences from viral illnesses in carriers and avoid repeated antibiotics unless there is microbiologic confirmation, aligning with stewardship principles [^113QZa4G] [^113t3sEg].

> Follow-up and reassessment are important, and I should double-check what is not needed. Routine post-treatment cultures or RADTs are not recommended for asymptomatic patients after adequate therapy, but patients with persistent or recurrent symptoms after 3–5 days should be re-evaluated for complications, alternative diagnoses, or treatment failure, including consideration of peritonsillar abscess or other deep neck infections [^112AUeiw] [^113noMib]. Hold on, I should verify that if non–beta-lactam antibiotics were used, culture and susceptibility may be warranted to guide therapy, which is a nuance that can be overlooked in routine care [^117UYzkr].

> I need to ensure I address complications and mimics that can derail care. Suppurative complications include peritonsillar and retropharyngeal abscesses, otitis media, and sinusitis, while nonsuppurative complications include acute rheumatic fever and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis; rare entities such as streptococcal toxic shock and even pulmonary-renal syndrome have been reported, underscoring the need for timely recognition and escalation when red flags appear [^116FzKUh] [^116H7Ktb] [^114NUwwQ]. Let me verify that in the emergency setting, maintaining a broad differential for airway-threatening mimics such as epiglottitis, deep space infections, and infectious mononucleosis is essential to avoid anchoring on GAS alone [^113HhDKt].

> Finally, I should review system-level quality and stewardship data to close the loop. Real-world studies show substantial variability and overprescribing of antibiotics for pharyngitis, with high rates of empiric therapy and unnecessary testing, which argues for embedded decision support, provider education, and feedback loops to align practice with guidelines [^116BCqma] [^1132zBfv]. Rapid test-guided strategies can reduce antibiotic prescriptions by about 25% without clear increases in complications, though effects on dispensing are smaller, so I need to pair testing strategies with communication and follow-up infrastructure to realize stewardship gains [^113bY21x] [^112ZsJgL]. Hold on, I should verify that incorporating local incidence data into decision rules can further refine pretest probabilities and reduce both missed cases and overtreatment when implemented at the point of care, which is a promising direction for future guidance [^114jiZ7o].

Diagnose strep throat using a **clinical scoring system** (Centor or McIsaac) to guide testing [^113u6iB7] [^117P3DY1]. In children and adolescents, obtain a **rapid antigen detection test (RADT)** and confirm negative results with a throat culture [^117FtXKa] [^114jnFcB]; in adults, RADT alone is usually sufficient [^1128DuC8]. Do not test patients with clear viral features or asymptomatic household contacts [^116AvKmX] [^111Dfgup]. Treat confirmed cases with **penicillin or amoxicillin for 10 days** [^115H7z7h]; use first-generation cephalosporins or macrolides for penicillin allergy [^115d74AE]. Provide analgesics and antipyretics for symptom relief [^113Le879]; avoid corticosteroids and aspirin in children [^111VdEoF] [^114kQUTD]. Educate on hygiene and return precautions for worsening symptoms or complications [^112ACtFT] [^113noMib].

---

## Clinical presentation and risk assessment

Typical symptoms include sudden sore throat, fever, **tonsillar exudates**, tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, and **absence of cough** [^115fzMKu]. The **Centor and McIsaac scores** help identify patients who should be tested for GAS [^113u6iB7] [^117P3DY1].

| **Centor criteria** | **Mcisaac modification** |
|-|-|
| Tonsillar exudates or swelling | Tonsillar exudates or swelling |
| Tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy | Tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy |
| Fever (> 38°C) | Fever (> 38°C) |
| Absence of cough | Absence of cough |
| N/A | Age 3–14 years (+1), 15–44 years (0), ≥ 45 years (-1) |

---

Interpretation: **0–1 points**: low risk, no testing; **2–3 points**: intermediate risk, test; **≥ 4 points**: high risk, test or consider empiric treatment [^112sp57W].

---

## Diagnostic testing

### Rapid antigen detection test (RADT)

- **High specificity (~95%)**: allows confident diagnosis when positive [^115Zdgvd].
- **Moderate sensitivity (~85%)**: false negatives occur, especially in low-prevalence settings [^115Zdgvd].
- **Children and adolescents**: confirm negative RADTs with throat culture due to higher GAS prevalence and risk of complications [^117FtXKa] [^114jnFcB].
- **Adults**: routine culture backup is not required, but consider if suspicion remains high [^1128DuC8].

---

### Throat culture

The **gold standard** with high sensitivity and specificity, but results are delayed 24–48 hours, limiting clinical utility [^115neyHM] [^115HMXBa]. It is recommended for pediatric and adolescent patients with negative RADTs [^117FtXKa] [^114jnFcB].

---

### Molecular tests (PCR)

PCR offers **high sensitivity and specificity** with rapid results, but cost and limited availability restrict widespread use [^11412YyT]. It is useful when available, particularly in high-risk or outbreak settings [^notfound].

---

## Indications for testing

- **Symptomatic patients**: with clinical features suggestive of GAS pharyngitis [^1135UNVK].
- **Children and adolescents**: with intermediate or high risk scores [^113u6iB7].
- **Avoid testing**: patients with clear viral features (cough, rhinorrhea, oral ulcers) or asymptomatic household contacts [^1135UNVK] [^111Dfgup].

## Management of confirmed strep throat

### Antibiotic therapy

First-line therapy is **penicillin V** 500 mg twice daily or amoxicillin 50 mg/kg once daily (max 1 g) for 10 days [^notfound]. For penicillin allergy, use first-generation cephalosporins (if no anaphylaxis), clindamycin, or macrolides (azithromycin 5 days) [^115d74AE]. Antibiotics reduce symptom duration, transmission, and risk of complications such as rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis [^115hURyA].

---

### Symptomatic management

Use **NSAIDs or acetaminophen** for pain and fever control [^113Le879]. Avoid aspirin in children due to Reye syndrome risk [^114kQUTD]. Corticosteroids are not recommended routinely due to limited benefit and potential risks [^111VdEoF].

---

## Prevention of complications and transmission

Advise patients to maintain strict **hand hygiene** and cover coughs and sneezes [^112ACtFT]. They should stay home from work or school until afebrile and at least 12–24 hours after starting antibiotics [^112ACtFT]. Educate on signs of complications — peritonsillar abscess, rheumatic fever, and glomerulonephritis — and when to seek care [^116FzKUh].

---

## Follow-up and special considerations

Routine post-treatment cultures are **not recommended** unless symptoms persist or recur [^112AUeiw] [^116cRSaQ]. Carriers do not require treatment or eradication therapy [^113QZa4G]. Persistent or recurrent symptoms warrant re-evaluation for alternative diagnoses or complications [^113noMib] [^113HhDKt].

### Analysis of different recommendations from international guidelines for the management of acute pharyngitis in adults and children [^111oj5uS]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Streptococcal pharyngitis is a frequently observed condition, but its optimal management continues to be debated.

Objective

The goal of this study was to evaluate the available guidelines, developed at the national level, for the management of streptococcal pharyngitis in Western countries, with a focus on their differences.

Methods

A literature search was conducted of the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, TRIP, and MEDLINE databases from their inception (1993 for the Cochrane Library, 1980 for EMBASE, 1997 for TRIP, and 1966 for MEDLINE) through April 25, 2010. The following search terms were used: pharyngitis, sore throat, tonsillitis, pharyngotonsillitis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Group A β-haemolytic Streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcal pharyngitis. Searches were limited to type of article or document (practice guideline or guideline) with no language restrictions or language limits.

Results

Twelve national guidelines were identified: 6 from European countries (France, United Kingdom, Finland, Holland, Scotland, and Belgium), 5 from the United States, and 1 from Canada. Recommendations differ substantially with regard to the use of a rapid antigen diagnostic test or throat culture and the indications for antibiotic treatment. The North American, Finnish, and French guidelines recommend performing one timely microbiologic investigation in suspected cases, and prescribing antibiotics in confirmed cases to prevent suppurative complications and acute rheumatic fever. According to the remaining European guidelines, however, acute sore throat is considered a benign, self-limiting disease. Microbiologic tests are not routinely recommended by these latter guidelines, and antibiotic treatment is reserved for well-selected cases. The use of the Centor score, for evaluation of the risk of streptococcal infection, is recommended by several guidelines, but subsequent decisions on the basis of the results differ in terms of which subjects should undergo microbiologic investigation. All guidelines agree that narrow-spectrum penicillin is the first choice of antibiotic for the treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis and that treatment should last for 10 days to eradicate the microorganism. Once-daily amoxicillin was recommended by 2 US guidelines as equally effective.

Conclusion

The present review found substantial discrepancies in the recommendations for the management of pharyngitis among national guidelines in Europe and North America.

The guideline is intended for use by healthcare providers who care for adult and pediatric patients with group A streptococcal pharyngitis. The guideline updates the 2002 Infectious Diseases Society of America guideline and discusses diagnosis and management, and recommendations are provided regarding antibiotic choices and dosing. Penicillin or amoxicillin remain the treatments of choice, and recommendations are made for the penicillin-allergic patient, which now include clindamycin.

### Diagnosis of strep throat in adults: are clinical criteria really good enough? [^113aYefM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The clinical manifestations of group A streptococcal and nonstreptococcal pharyngitis overlap quite broadly. For this reason, the updated Infectious Diseases Society of America practice guideline for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, published in this issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases, recommends laboratory confirmation of the clinical diagnosis by means of either throat culture or a rapid antigen detection test. However, a recently published guideline, developed by a subcommittee of the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine (ACP-ASIM) in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, advocates use of a clinical algorithm alone, in lieu of microbiologic testing, for confirmation of the diagnosis in adults for whom the suspicion of streptococcal infection is high. In this discussion, we examine the assumptions of the ACP-ASIM guideline, question whether its recommendations will achieve the stated objective of dramatically decreasing excess antibiotic use, and suggest that its recommendations be confirmed by clinical trials before clinicians abandon long-held teachings regarding diagnosis and management of group A streptococcal pharyngitis.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: group A streptococcal pharyngitis, diagnosis and treatment in children [^1149Qq4Q]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2024). Medium credibility.

Group A streptococcus (GAS) is the most common bacterial cause of pharyngitis in children. GAS causes significant suppurative and non-suppurative complications including invasive GAS disease and acute rheumatic fever. This article describes the current epidemiology and clinical presentation of GAS pharyngitis and explores how diagnostic and treatment decisions differ globally. Several key decision support tools are discussed including international guidelines, clinical decision scores and laboratory tests along with the evidence for treatment choice and duration. With recent international reports describing an increase in GAS infections, clinicians should be familiar with their local GAS pharyngitis guidelines and the rationale for diagnosis and treatment of this common childhood illness.

### Pharyngitis management: defining the controversy [^1149pYrX]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Despite numerous controlled trials, clinical practice guidelines and cost-effective analyses, controversy persists regarding the appropriate management strategy for adult pharyngitis. In this perspective, we explore this controversy by comparing two competing clinical guidelines. Although the guidelines appear to make widely diverging recommendations, we show that the controversy centers on only a small proportion of patients: those presenting with severe pharyngitis. We examine recently published data to illustrate that this seemingly simple problem of strep throat remains a philosophical issue: should we give primacy to relieving acute time-limited symptoms, or should we emphasize the potential societal risk of antibiotic resistance? We accept potentially over treating a minority of adult pharyngitis patients with the most severe presentations to reduce suffering in an approximately equal number of patients who will have false negative test results if the test-and-treat strategy were used.

### Guideline for the management of acute sore throat [^111Ttea5]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2012). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, ESCMID 2012 guidelines recommend to discuss the likely benefits of antibiotic therapy in patients with more severe presentations (3–4 Centor criteria). Weigh the modest benefits of antibiotics in group A β-hemolytic streptococcus-positive patients and patients with 3–4 Centor criteria against side effects, the effect of antibiotics on the microbiota, increased antibacterial resistance, medicalization, and costs.

### Modalities of group A streptococcal prevention and treatment and their economic justification [^112ZsJgL]. NPJ Vaccines (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This review synthesises two decades of studies incorporating economic evaluation of Strep A prevention and treatment modalities. The cohort of these studies are notable for their scope. Though, the vast majority evaluated clinical diagnostic or therapeutic strategies to manage acute disease and focused on near-term outcomes. For example, the largest number of included publications addressed primary prevention (n = 19), particularly diagnostic strategy for acute pharyngitis (n = 5). These studies largely found that performing RADTs in all patients presenting with pharyngitis was cost-effective in reducing antibiotic consumption compared to other diagnostic and management strategies. Use of RADT was also a favourable strategy for diagnosing and managing pharyngitis when considering the reduction in risk of ARF and other sequelae in studies that did, and did not, include reductions in duration of infection as a benefit. However, few, if any, studies considered the implications of diagnostic tests detecting upper respiratory tract carriage of Strep A among cases of viral infection, which might lead to unnecessary antibiotic treatment.

The number of studies focusing on diagnostic strategies may suggest to decision-makers that this is the key clinical or public health question in addressing Strep A burden; i.e. the area with the most evaluation is the impost important or impactful. However, studies which identify cost-effective strategies for pharyngitis management do not necessarily translate into studies for cost-effective strategies to reduce the population-level burden of post-infection sequalae, including ARF and RHD. Only seven studies evaluated strategies to reduce the incidence of ARF and/or RHD among the general population. and four studies evaluated strategies to prevent worsening of established disease –. While these studies indicate that improving the coverage of existing or introducing new prevention strategies are economically justifiable, the body of existing literature does not clearly meet the needs of decision makers targeting the population-wide reduction in post-infection sequelae.

### Review: known, emerging, and remerging pharyngitis pathogens [^112Jhug4]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

DIAGNOSTIC GAPS: POINTS TO PONDER

Pharyngitis may be caused by known pathogens such as GAS, but also by emerging and reemerging pathogens because of ever evolving geopolitical and social paradigms. To effectively diagnose and treat pharyngitis and promote antibiotic stewardship, it is imperative that new diagnostic methods keep pace. Cutting-edge technologies such as nucleic acid amplification can simultaneously detect and quantify multiple pathogens, and assist in the appropriate diagnosis, management, and outcomes of individuals with pharyngitis. However, individuals may simultaneously be colonized with bacterial and viral pathogens, which can confound the interpretation of test results and lead to unnecessary antibiotic administration or inappropriate patient management. These new detection methods must be able to distinguish between these 2 conditions while remaining cost effective. The second article of this supplement will elaborate on the current state of laboratory and point-of-care diagnostic testing for pharyngitis and address these and other knowledge gaps.

### Variability in the diagnosis and treatment of group a streptococcal pharyngitis by primary care pediatricians [^116BCqma]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare practice patterns regarding the diagnosis and management of streptococcal pharyngitis across pediatric primary care practices.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

All encounters to 25 pediatric primary care practices sharing an electronic health record.

Methods

Streptococcal pharyngitis was defined by an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code for acute pharyngitis, positive laboratory test, antibiotic prescription, and absence of an alternative bacterial infection. Logistic regression models standardizing for patient-level characteristics were used to compare diagnosis, testing, and broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment for children with pharyngitis across practices. Fixed-effects models and likelihood ratio tests were conducted to analyze within-practice variation.

Results

Of 399,793 acute encounters in 1 calendar year, there were 52,658 diagnoses of acute pharyngitis, including 12,445 diagnoses of streptococcal pharyngitis. After excluding encounters by patients with chronic conditions and standardizing for age, sex, insurance type, and race, there was significant variability across and within practices in the diagnosis and testing for streptococcal pharyngitis. Excluding patients with antibiotic allergies or prior antibiotic use, off-guideline antibiotic prescribing for confirmed group A streptococcal pharyngitis ranged from 1% to 33% across practices (P < .001). At the clinician level, 13 of 25 sites demonstrated significant within-practice variability in off-guideline antibiotic prescribing (P ≤ .05). Only 18 of the 222 clinicians in the network accounted for half of all off-guideline antibiotic prescribing.

Conclusions

Significant variability in the diagnosis and treatment of pharyngitis exists across and within pediatric practices, which cannot be explained by relevant clinical or demographic factors. Our data support clinician-targeted interventions to improve adherence to prescribing guidelines for this common condition.

### Sore throat: is it such a big deal anymore? [^117UqnmX]. The Journal of Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Sore throat remains a common disease of childhood, and a major cost and cause for antibiotic prescriptions. The management of sore throat remains controversial in affluent countries with various guidelines available and overall poor adherence to those guidelines. Group A streptococcus is the commonest bacterial cause with important sequelae including acute rheumatic fever (ARF). The driver for diagnosis and treatment is still questionable. In most affluent populations it is difficult to justify antibiotic treatment on the basis of preventing ARF, whereas this remains the major driver for sore throat management in populations at higher risk of ARF. Reduction in severity and duration of symptoms may be a reasonable basis to consider antibiotic treatment, and thus accurate diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis, particularly in those with more severe symptoms. The potential role of rapid tests in diagnosis appears to be increasing.

### Tonsillitis and tonsilloliths: diagnosis and management [^112BrrDu]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Tonsillitis, or inflammation of the tonsils, makes up approximately 0.4% of outpatient visits in the United States. Tonsillitis is caused by a viral infection in 70% to 95% of cases. However, bacterial infections caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) account for tonsillitis in 5% to 15% of adults and 15% to 30% of patients five to 15 years of age. It is important to differentiate group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus from other bacterial or viral causes of pharyngitis and tonsillitis because of the risk of progression to more systemic complications such as abscess, acute glomerulonephritis, rheumatic fever, and scarlet fever after infection with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus. A variety of diagnostic tools are available, including symptom-based validated scoring systems (e.g. Centor score), and oropharyngeal and serum laboratory testing. Treatment is focused on supportive care, and if group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus is identified, penicillin should be used as the first-line antibiotic. In cases of recurrent tonsillitis, watchful waiting is strongly recommended if there have been less than seven episodes in the past year, less than five episodes per year for the past two years, or less than three episodes per year for the past three years. Tonsilloliths, or tonsil stones, are managed expectantly, and small tonsilloliths are common clinical findings. Rarely, surgical intervention is required if they become too large to pass on their own.

### Rapid diagnostic tests for group A streptococcal pharyngitis: a meta-analysis [^115Zdgvd]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Effective management of group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis is hindered by impracticality of the gold standard diagnostic test: throat culture. Rapid antigen diagnostic tests (RADTs) are a promising alternative, although concerns about their sensitivity and specificity, and variation between test methodologies, have limited their clinical use. The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review with meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of RADTs for GAS pharyngitis.

Methods

Medline and Embase from 1996 to 2013 were used as data sources. Of 159 identified studies, 48 studies of diagnostic accuracy of GAS RADTs using throat culture on blood agar as a reference standard were selected. Bivariate random-effects regression was used to estimate sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Additional meta-analyses were performed for pediatric data.

Results

A total of 60 pairs of sensitivity and specificity from 48 studies were included. Overall summary estimates for sensitivity and specificity of RADTs were 0.86 (95% CI 0.83 to 0.88) and 0.96 (95% CI 0.94 to 0.97), respectively, and estimates for pediatric data were similar. Molecular-based RADTs had the best diagnostic accuracy. Considerable variability exists in methodology between studies. There were insufficient studies to allow meta-regression/subgroup analysis within each test type.

Conclusions

RADTs can be used for accurate diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis to streamline management of sore throat in primary care. RADTs may not require culture backup for negative tests in most low-incidence rheumatic fever settings. Newer molecular tests have the highest sensitivity, but are not true point-of-care tests.

### Differences among international pharyngitis guidelines: not just academic [^116HrY17]. Annals of Family Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

Many countries have national guidelines for the treatment of pharyngitis. We wanted to compare the recommendations and the reported evidence in national guidelines for the management of acute sore throat in adults.

Methods

Guidelines were retrieved via MEDLINE and EMBASE and through a Web-based search for guideline development organizations. The content of the recommendations and the underlying evidence were analyzed with qualitative and bibliometric methods.

Results

We included 4 North American and 6 European guidelines. Recommendations differ with regard to the use of a rapid antigen test and throat culture and with the indication for antibiotics. The North American, French, and Finnish guidelines consider diagnosis of group A streptococcus essential, and prevention of acute rheumatic fever remains an important reason to prescribe antibiotics. In 4 of the 6 European guidelines, acute sore throat is considered a self-limiting disease and antibiotics are not recommended. The evidence used to underpin these guidelines was different in North America and Europe. North American guidelines cited more North American references than did European guidelines (87.2% vs 48.0%; ods ratio, 4.6–11.9; P < .001).

Conclusion

Although the evidence for the management of acute sore throat is easily available, national guidelines are different with regard to the choice of evidence and the interpretation for clinical practice. Also a transparent and standardized guideline development method is lacking. These findings are important in the context of appropriate antibiotic use, the problem of growing antimicrobial resistance, and costs for the community.

### Clinical practice guideline update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America on group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis [^113u6iB7]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, more specifically with respect to clinical scoring systems, IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider using a clinical scoring system, such as Centor or McIsaac, to determine which patients with sore throat should be tested for group A streptococcus.

- strongly consider testing high-risk patients even if their clinical scores are low. High-risk patients include those with sore throat who have had household exposure to group A streptococcus, such as living or sleeping in the same indoor shared space as a person diagnosed with group A streptococcus infection, a history of previous rheumatic fever diagnosis, or symptoms or signs suggestive of complicated local or systemic group A streptococcus infection, such as peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscess, scarlet fever, and/or toxic shock syndrome

- use a clinical scoring system as part of the evaluation of patients with sore throat. The principal utility of a scoring system is to identify patients with a low probability of group A streptococcus pharyngitis, in whom further evaluation by diagnostic testing is unlikely to be helpful

- given the lack of evidence favoring any particular scoring system, clinicians and patients may favor clinical scoring systems that do not include laboratory tests

- recognize that the recommendation to use a scoring system does not apply to children under 3 years of age, as group A streptococcus infection in this age group may not present with typical clinical features represented in these scoring systems.

### Clinical mimics: an emergency medicine-focused review of streptococcal pharyngitis mimics [^113HhDKt]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Pharyngitis is a common disease in the emergency department (ED). Despite a relatively low incidence of complications, there are many dangerous conditions that can mimic this disease and are essential for the emergency physician to consider.

Objective

This article provides a review of the evaluation and management of group A β-hemolytic Streptococcal (GABHS) pharyngitis, as well as important medical conditions that can mimic this disease.

Discussion

GABHS pharyngitis often presents with fever, sore throat, tonsillar exudates, and anterior cervical lymphadenopathy. History and physical examination are insufficient for the diagnosis. The Centor criteria or McIsaac score can help risk stratify patients for subsequent testing or treatment. Antibiotics may reduce symptom duration and suppurative complications, but the effect is small. Rheumatic fever is uncommon in developed countries, and shared decision making is recommended if antibiotics are used for this indication. Oral analgesics and topical anesthetics are important for symptom management. Physicians should consider alternate diagnoses that may mimic GABHS pharyngitis, which can include epiglottitis, infectious mononucleosis, Kawasaki disease, acute retroviral syndrome, Lemierre's syndrome, Ludwig's angina, peritonsillar abscess, retropharyngeal abscess, and viral pharyngitis. A focused history and physical examination can help differentiate these conditions.

Conclusions

GABHS may present similarly to other benign and potentially deadly diseases. Diagnosis and treatment of pharyngitis should be based on clinical evaluation. Consideration of pharyngitis mimics is important in the evaluation and management of ED patients.

### Diagnosis and treatment of pharyngitis in children [^116NBCTp]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Acute pharyngitis is one of the most common illnesses for which children visit primary care physicians. Most cases of acute pharyngitis in children are caused by viruses and are benign and self-limited. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus is the most important of the bacterial causes of acute pharyngitis. Strategies for diagnosis and treatment of acute pharyngitis are directed at distinguishing children with viral pharyngitis, who would not benefit from antimicrobial therapy, from children with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis, for whom antimicrobial therapy would be beneficial. Making this distinction is crucial in attempting to minimize the unnecessary use of antimicrobial agents in children.

### Diagnosis and antibiotic treatment of group a streptococcal pharyngitis in children in a primary care setting: impact of point-of-care polymerase chain reaction [^117N2iVj]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Infection with Streptococcus pyogenes (group A beta-hemolytic streptococci; GAS) is the most common bacterial cause of acute pharyngitis and is responsible for an estimated 20–30% of sore throat cases in children. In the United States, the societal cost of GAS pharyngitis is estimated to range from $224 to $539 million per year, with children missing an average of 1.9 days of school/daycare and 42% of parents missing a mean of 1.8 days of work. The timely initiation of antibiotics can effectively treat GAS pharyngitis, prevent the spread of infection to close contacts, reduce the duration of symptoms, and limit rare long-term complications. Acute pharyngitis can be a result of either bacterial or viral pathogens and, as such, current clinical guidelines encourage the use of antibiotics only for confirmed cases of GAS. Despite these recommendations, and the overall rates of documented GAS infections (5–30% of sore throat visits), antibiotics are often prescribed in as many as 60% of patient visits for sore throat. Greater awareness of the development of bacterial resistance resulting from the overprescribing of antibiotics is increasing the urgency to move away from empiric antibiotic treatment for common respiratory infections.

### Streptococcal pharyngitis: rapid evidence review [^113noMib]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis is a common infection responsible for more than 6 million office visits in the United States annually. Only 10% of adults seeking care for a sore throat have group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis; however, 60% or more are prescribed antibiotics. Guidelines recommend using clinical decision rules to assess the risk of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection, followed by rapid antigen testing if a diagnosis is unclear, before prescribing antibiotics. Fever, tonsillar exudate, cervical lymphadenitis, and patient ages of 3 to 15 years increase clinical suspicion. A cough is more suggestive of a viral etiology. The limited history used in these decision rules is amenable to virtual visits. After a negative rapid antigen test result, a throat culture is recommended in children and adolescents. Penicillin and amoxicillin are first-line antibiotics, with a recommended course of 10 days; first-generation cephalosporins are recommended for patients with nonanaphylactic allergies to penicillin. There is significant resistance to azithromycin and clarithromycin in some parts of the United States. Steroids are not recommended for symptomatic treatment. Patients with worsening symptoms after appropriate antibiotic initiation or with symptoms lasting 5 days after the start of treatment should be reevaluated. Tonsillectomy is rarely recommended as a preventive measure: seven episodes of streptococcal pharyngitis in 1 year, five episodes in each of the past 2 years, or three episodes in each of the past 3 years are commonly used thresholds for considering surgery.

### Management of acute pharyngitis in children: summary of the Italian national institute of health guidelines [^113ofeiD]. Clinical Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Discrepancies in the management of pharyngitis in children have been reported in Europe and the United States, and recommendations concerning the use of clinical scores, rapid antigen diagnostic tests (RADTs) or throat cultures, and the indications for antibiotic treatment largely differ.

Objective

This article summarizes the Italian guidelines on the management of pharyngitis in children issued by the National Institute of Health.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of experts (the Guidelines Development Group) developed and used a set of key questions to conduct a systematic review of the literature. Relevant publications in English were identified through a systematic review of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from their inception through April 30, 2011. Final recommendations were scaled according to the Italian National Guidelines Program grading.

Results

Eighteen clinical questions were defined, and 44 recommendations were issued. None of the available scoring systems is sufficiently accurate to identify group A β-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) pharyngitis in settings with low prevalence for rheumatic disease. RADT should be performed by trained personnel in every child with a history and signs/symptoms suggestive of GABHS pharyngitis. RADT is not recommended in children with a McIsaac score of 0 or 1 with ≥ 2 signs/symptoms suggestive of viral infection. Backup culture in children with negative RADT result is not recommended. Culture test with antibiotic susceptibility assay should be performed exclusively for epidemiologic purposes. Streptococcal antibody titers are of no value in diagnosing acute pharyngitis. Antibiotic therapy is recommended in microbiologically documented GABHS pharyngitis. Because penicillin V is not available in Italy, amoxicillin (50 mg/kg/d in 2–3 doses orally) for 10 days is the first choice of treatment. In noncompliant cases, benzathine penicillin may be administered. Although not routinely recommended due to the high cost and wide spectrum of activity, a 5-day course with a second-generation cephalosporin may be used in noncompliant cases. Macrolides should be limited to children with demonstrated type I hypersensitivity to penicillin. Ibuprofen or paracetamol is recommended for relief of pain or fever associated with discomfort. Because the carrier state is not associated with increased risk of suppurative complications and risk of GABHS transmission to contacts is minimal, the carrier state should never be investigated and treated. Recommendations for the management of suppurative complications are given.

Conclusions

This guideline provides a comprehensive, evidence based, tool for the diagnosis and therapy of acute pharyngitis in children.

### Empirical validation of guidelines for the management of pharyngitis in children and adults [^111RUTM1]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Recent guidelines for management of pharyngitis vary in their recommendations concerning empirical antibiotic treatment and the need for laboratory confirmation of group A streptococcus (GAS).

Objective

To assess the impact of guideline recommendations and alternative approaches on identification and treatment of GAS pharyngitis in children and adults.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Throat cultures and rapid antigen tests were performed on 787 children and adults aged 3 to 69 years with acute sore throat attending a family medicine clinic in Calgary, Alberta, from September 1999 to August 2002. Recommendations from 2 guidelines (those of the Infectious Diseases Society of America and of the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine/American Academy of Family Physicians/US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) were compared with rapid testing alone, a clinical prediction rule (ie, the modified Centor score), and a criterion standard of treatment for positive throat culture results only.

Main Outcome Measures

Sensitivity and specificity of each strategy for identifying GAS pharyngitis, total antibiotics recommended, and unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions.

Results

In children, sensitivity for streptococcal infection ranged from 85.8% (133/155; 95% confidence interval, 79.3%-90.0%) for rapid testing to 100% for culturing all. In adults, sensitivity ranged from 76.7% (56/73; 95% CI, 65.4%-85.8%) for rapid testing without culture confirmation of negative results to 100% for culturing all. In children, specificity ranged from 90.3% (270/299; 95% CI, 86.4%-93.4%) for use of modified Centor score and throat culture to 100% for culturing all. In adults, specificity ranged from 43.8% (114/260; 95% CI, 37.7%-50.1%) for empirical treatment based on a modified Centor score of 3 or 4 to 100% for culturing all. Total antibiotic prescriptions were lowest with rapid testing (24.7% [194/787]; 95% CI, 21.7%-27.8%) and highest with empirical treatment of high-risk adults (45.7% [360/787]; 95% CI, 42.2%-49.3%), due to a high rate of unnecessary prescriptions in adults (43.8% [146/333]; 95% CI, 38.4%-49.4%).

Conclusions

Guideline recommendations for the selective use of throat cultures but antibiotic treatment based only on positive rapid test or throat culture results can reduce unnecessary use of antibiotics for treatment of pharyngitis. However, empirical treatment of adults having a Centor score of 3 or 4 is associated with a high rate of unnecessary antibiotic use. In children, strategies incorporating throat culture or throat culture confirmation of negative rapid antigen test results are highly sensitive and specific. Throat culture of all adults or those selected on the basis of a clinical prediction rule had the highest sensitivity and specificity.

### Pharyngitis [^116cRSaQ]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Sore throat is one of the most common reasons for visits to family physicians. While most patients with sore throat have an infectious cause (pharyngitis), fewer than 20 percent have a clear indication for antibiotic therapy (i.e., group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection). Useful, well-validated clinical decision rules are available to help family physicians care for patients who present with pharyngitis. Because of recent improvements in rapid streptococcal antigen tests, throat culture can be reserved for patients whose symptoms do not improve over time or who do not respond to antibiotics.

### Diagnosis and antibiotic treatment of group a streptococcal pharyngitis in children in a primary care setting: impact of point-of-care polymerase chain reaction [^115neyHM]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Historically, bacterial culture is considered the gold standard because it is believed to be both highly sensitive and highly specific. In clinical trials, cultures are generally performed at a central reference laboratory under rigorous procedural oversight and optimized transport conditions to prioritize sensitivity, with limited concern about turnaround times. The sensitivity results in this study (71.8% [62.4–80.0%]) and others (81 and 86.8%) that look at culture under real-world conditions, often with less rigorous procedural oversight, raise questions about its use in routine clinical care, especially in light of the time delay to report results back to providers.

Turnaround time is a high priority for patient care, timely results are necessary for optimal management. This is particularly important for streptococcal pharyngitis, because children are highly contagious until treated and both individual and community health are adversely affected by delays in diagnosis. Parental desire for a timely diagnosis and treatment, along with the additional resources needed to follow-up on culture results and report these results to parents, place additional strains on providers. As a result, clinicians often empirically prescribe antibiotics before receiving the final test results, or treat based on clinical presentation alone, which has low proven specificity. Prudent use of antibiotics by outpatients is necessary to prevent the development and spread of bacterial resistance.

### Should a near-patient test be part of the management of pharyngitis in the pediatric emergency department? [^112E3VnW]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The study's objective was to evaluate the efficacy of a rapid streptococcal test as a single diagnostic agent in the diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis in patients presenting to a pediatric emergency department.

Methods

We performed a rapid streptococcal test as part of the diagnostic workup for patients presenting with clinical findings consistent with streptococcal pharyngitis. In addition to undergoing the study intervention, each patient had a standard throat swab sent to the laboratory for formal culture. A questionnaire detailing the clinical features was to be completed in each case.

Results

Two hundred ten near-patient tests were performed. Complete laboratory results were available in 177 cases (77%). Clinical data were available for analysis in 94 patients (53%). In our patient population, the near-patient test had a high specificity (98.6%) but a low sensitivity (71%). The clinical presentation of confirmed group A β-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis is very variable.

Conclusions

The QuickVue In-Line Strep A test for streptococcal pharyngitis is unreliable in our patient population. Clinical findings are unhelpful in confirming the diagnosis. Formal laboratory culture is the criterion standard for identifying the organism, but the results are not clinically significant in every case. Acute pharyngitis presenting to the pediatric emergency department can be managed in accordance with the recommendations in the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network guideline.

### Adherence to guidelines for testing and treatment of children with pharyngitis: a retrospective study [^1156R5ih]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Group A streptococcus (GAS) is the most common bacterial etiology of pharyngitis, accounting for approximately one quarter of cases of pharyngitis that bring children to medical attention. Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and suppurative complications of GAS can be prevented by early antibacterial treatment; indeed, prevention of ARF is one of the primary goals of antibiotic treatment of GAS pharyngitis. However, GAS pharyngitis is difficult to distinguish clinically from viral pharyngitis. Treating children who have viral pharyngitis with antimicrobials is ineffective, generates unnecessary costs, exposes them to antibiotic side effects without benefit, and contributes to the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance. To minimize prescription of antimicrobials for viral pharyngitis, clinical scoring systems have been developed to predict the likelihood of GAS infection. Among these is the McIsaac score, which was developed and validated in both children and adults. Such scores have low positive predictive values, but help identify patients at low risk of GAS, in whom testing is not only unnecessary but may lead to identification of chronic GAS carriers experiencing viral pharyngitis.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guideline on diagnosis and management of GAS pharyngitis recommends that patients whose clinical presentation is consistent with GAS pharyngitis be tested with a streptococcal rapid antigen detection test (RADT) or throat culture; treatment is indicated if either is positive. Testing is not recommended for patients whose presentation is most consistent with a viral etiology. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has made similar recommendations. Nonetheless, studies evaluating the management of pharyngitis among pediatric providers have identified high rates of antibiotic prescribing, even for patients with negative GAS tests. To our knowledge, no study in a pediatric population has yet evaluated adherence to IDSA guidelines using individual patients' clinical data and test results.

### Diagnosis and treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis [^114WGiQz]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Common signs and symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis include sore throat, temperature greater than 100.4 degrees F (38 degrees C), tonsillar exudates, and cervical adenopathy. Cough, coryza, and diarrhea are more common with viral pharyngitis. Available diagnostic tests include throat culture and rapid antigen detection testing. Throat culture is considered the diagnostic standard, although the sensitivity and specificity of rapid antigen detection testing have improved significantly. The modified Centor score can be used to help physicians decide which patients need no testing, throat culture/rapid antigen detection testing, or empiric antibiotic therapy. Penicillin (10 days of oral therapy or one injection of intramuscular benzathine penicillin) is the treatment of choice because of cost, narrow spectrum of activity, and effectiveness. Amoxicillin is equally effective and more palatable. Erythromycin and first-generation cephalosporins are options in patients with penicillin allergy. Increased group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) treatment failure with penicillin has been reported. Although current guidelines recommend first-generation cephalosporins for persons with penicillin allergy, some advocate the use of cephalosporins in all nonallergic patients because of better GABHS eradication and effectiveness against chronic GABHS carriage. Chronic GABHS colonization is common despite appropriate use of antibiotic therapy. Chronic carriers are at low risk of transmitting disease or developing invasive GABHS infections, and there is generally no need to treat carriers. Whether tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy decreases the incidence of GABHS pharyngitis is poorly understood. At this time, the benefits are too small to outweigh the associated costs and surgical risks.

### Adherence to guidelines for testing and treatment of children with pharyngitis: a retrospective study [^117SJ74v]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Group A streptococcus (GAS) is the most common bacterial etiology of pharyngitis but is difficult to distinguish clinically from viral pharyngitis. There are benefits to early antibacterial treatment of GAS pharyngitis, but administering antibiotics to children with viral pharyngitis is ineffective and costly. We evaluated adherence to guidelines that were developed to help clinicians distinguish between viral and GAS pharyngitis and guide management.

Methods

Retrospective cohort study of patients ages 3–18 who had a rapid streptococcal test and/or throat culture performed in an outpatient setting. We collected data on documentation of components of the McIsaac score and classified tests as indicated if the score was ≥ 2. Based on McIsaac score and GAS test results, we determined whether each antibiotic course prescribed was indicated according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America guideline.

Results

Among 291 eligible children, 87 (30%) had all five components of the McIsaac score documented. There was sufficient data to classify the score as either < 2 or ≥ 2 in 234 (80%); among these, 96% of tests were indicated. Twenty-nine patients (10%) were prescribed antibiotics. Eight (28%) of these prescriptions were not indicated according to guidelines.

Conclusions

The majority of GAS tests in children with pharyngitis are indicated, although providers do not regularly document all elements of a validated pharyngitis scoring tool. Over one quarter of children prescribed antibiotics for pharyngitis did not require antibiotics according to guidelines. There remains a role for targeted antimicrobial stewardship education regarding pharyngitis management in pediatric outpatient settings.

### Emergency department prescribing patterns for pharyngitis in children [^114ff2PA]. Clinical Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Pharyngitis is commonly diagnosed in the emergency department (ED) and accounts for substantial antibiotic burden in pediatrics. This study describes ED patterns of group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis diagnosis and antibiotic prescribing patterns. This was a secondary data analysis of the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. Diagnosis and antibiotic treatment for GAS and non-GAS (viral) pharyngitis were reported in all ages and specifically examined in children < 3 years of age from 2010 to 2015. GAS pharyngitis was diagnosed in 29% of visits for children with pharyngitis; however, 60% of patients with any pharyngitis received antibiotics. Twenty percent of children < 3 years were diagnosed with GAS pharyngitis, yet over half were given antibiotics. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were commonly prescribed. Antibiotic treatment of pharyngitis, including broad-spectrum antibiotics, remains high when compared with the known prevalence of GAS pharyngitis. Diagnosis and treatment of GAS pharyngitis in patients < 3 years persists despite recommendations against testing.

### A rare sequela of untreated Streptococcus pharyngitis: a case report [^116H7Ktb]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Streptococcus is a common bacterium that causes pharyngitis. Timely antibiotic treatment is critically important to prevent severe complications. One of the rarest complications of untreated streptococcal pharyngitis is pulmonary‐renal syndrome (PRS), defined by rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (PGN) and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH).PGN is a swiftly worsening form of kidney inflammation within the glomeruli, causing a reduction in the kidney's ability to filter waste. This presents with edema, hematuria, and hypertension which leads to kidney failure if not treated promptly.DAH presents with hemoptysis and respiratory distress due to small capillaries bleeding into the alveolar spaces of the lungs. The accumulation of blood impairs gas exchange, leading to rapidly developing respiratory failure, often requiring mechanical ventilation.

Together these conditions form PRS, a condition with high rates of morbidity and mortality, requiring urgent medical intervention. Although PRS is more commonly associated with autoimmune disorders, post‐streptococcal PRS is exceedingly rare, highlighting the need for early recognition and treatment. The goal of this case report is to raise awareness of an extremely rare complication of untreated streptococcal pharyngitis: pulmonary‐renal syndrome. This case emphasizes the importance of early antibiotic adherence and guiding providers on the swift diagnosis and management of PRS to improve patient outcomes.

### Different antibiotic treatments for group A streptococcal pharyngitis [^114AaBsW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics provide only modest benefit in treating sore throat, although their effectiveness increases in people with positive throat swabs for group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). It is unclear which antibiotic is the best choice if antibiotics are indicated. This is an update of a review first published in 2010, and updated in 2013, 2016, and 2020.

Objectives

To assess the comparative efficacy of different antibiotics in: (a) alleviating symptoms (pain, fever); (b) shortening the duration of the illness; (c) preventing clinical relapse (i.e. recurrence of symptoms after initial resolution); and (d) preventing complications (suppurative complications, acute rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). To assess the evidence on the comparative incidence of adverse effects and the risk-benefit of antibiotic treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 3 September 2020: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 8), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946), Embase Elsevier (from 1974), and Web of Science Thomson Reuters (from 2010). We also searched clinical trial registers on 3 September 2020.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind trials comparing different antibiotics, and reporting at least one of the following: clinical cure, clinical relapse, or complications and/or adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion and extracted data using standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies according to the methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, and used the GRADE approach to assess the overall certainty of the evidence for the outcomes. We have reported the intention-to-treat analysis, and also performed an analysis of evaluable participants to explore the robustness of the intention-to-treat results.

Main Results

We included 19 trials reported in 18 publications (5839 randomised participants): six trials compared penicillin with cephalosporins; six compared penicillin with macrolides; three compared penicillin with carbacephem; one compared penicillin with sulphonamides; one compared clindamycin with ampicillin; and one compared azithromycin with amoxicillin in children. All participants had confirmed acute GABHS tonsillopharyngitis, and ages ranged from one month to 80 years. Nine trials included only, or predominantly, children. Most trials were conducted in an outpatient setting. Reporting of randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding was poor in all trials. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence mainly due to lack of (or poor reporting of) randomisation or blinding, or both; heterogeneity; and wide confidence intervals. Cephalosporins versus penicillin We are uncertain if there is a difference in symptom resolution (at 2 to 15 days) for cephalosporins versus penicillin (odds ratio (OR) for absence of symptom resolution 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 1.12; 5 trials; 2018 participants; low-certainty evidence). Results of the sensitivity analysis of evaluable participants differed (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97; 5 trials; 1660 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if clinical relapse may be lower for cephalosporins compared with penicillin (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.99; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 50; 4 trials; 1386 participants; low-certainty evidence). Very low-certainty evidence showed no difference in reported adverse events. Macrolides versus penicillin We are uncertain if there is a difference between macrolides and penicillin for resolution of symptoms (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.35; 6 trials; 1728 participants; low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis of evaluable participants resulted in an OR of 0.79, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.09; 6 trials; 1159 participants). We are uncertain if clinical relapse may be different (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.03; 6 trials; 802 participants; low-certainty evidence). Azithromycin versus amoxicillin Based on one unpublished trial in children, we are uncertain if resolution of symptoms is better with azithromycin in a single dose versus amoxicillin for 10 days (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.05; 1 trial; 673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis for per-protocol analysis resulted in an OR of 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.73; 1 trial; 482 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are also uncertain if there was a difference in relapse between groups (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.82; 1 trial; 422 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Adverse events were more common with azithromycin compared to amoxicillin (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.78 to 3.99; 1 trial; 673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Carbacephem versus penicillin There is low-certainty evidence that compared with penicillin, carbacephem may provide better symptom resolution post-treatment in adults and children (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.99; NNTB 14.3; 3 trials; 795 participants). Studies did not report on long-term complications, so it was unclear if any class of antibiotics was better in preventing serious but rare complications. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We are uncertain if there are clinically relevant differences in symptom resolution when comparing cephalosporins and macrolides with penicillin in the treatment of GABHS tonsillopharyngitis. Low-certainty evidence in children suggests that carbacephem may be more effective than penicillin for symptom resolution. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions regarding the other comparisons in this review. Data on complications were too scarce to draw conclusions. These results do not demonstrate that other antibiotics are more effective than penicillin in the treatment of GABHS pharyngitis. All studies were conducted in high-income countries with a low risk of streptococcal complications, so there is a need for trials in low-income countries and Aboriginal communities, where the risk of complications remains high.

### Modalities of group A streptococcal prevention and treatment and their economic justification [^113yBPQL]. NPJ Vaccines (2023). Medium credibility.

Infection by group A Streptococcus (Strep A) results in a diverse range of clinical conditions, including pharyngitis, impetigo, cellulitis, necrotising fasciitis, and rheumatic heart disease. In this article, we outline the recommended strategies for Strep A treatment and prevention and review the literature for economic evaluations of competing treatment and prevention strategies. We find that most economic evaluations focus on reducing the duration of illness or risk of rheumatic fever among people presenting with sore throat through diagnostic and/or treatment strategies. Few studies have evaluated strategies to reduce the burden of Strep A infection among the general population, nor have they considered the local capacity to finance and implement strategies. Evaluation of validated costs and consequences for a more diverse range of Strep A interventions are needed to ensure policies maximise patient outcomes under budget constraints. This should include attention to basic public health strategies and emerging strategies such as vaccination.

### Common questions about streptococcal pharyngitis [^1144dknB]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) infection causes 15% to 30% of sore throats in children and 5% to 15% in adults, and is more common in the late winter and early spring. The strongest independent predictors of GABHS pharyngitis are patient age of five to 15 years, absence of cough, tender anterior cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudates, and fever. To diagnose GABHS pharyngitis, a rapid antigen detection test should be ordered in patients with a modified Centor or FeverPAIN score of 2 or 3. First-line treatment for GABHS pharyngitis includes a 10-day course of penicillin or amoxicillin. Patients allergic to penicillin can be treated with firstgeneration cephalosporins, clindamycin, or macrolide antibiotics. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are more effective than acetaminophen and placebo for treatment of fever and pain associated with GABHS pharyngitis; medicated throat lozenges used every two hours are also effective. Corticosteroids provide only a small reduction in the duration of symptoms and should not be used routinely.

### Efficacy and safety of rapid tests to guide antibiotic prescriptions for sore throat [^113bY21x]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sore throat is a common condition caused by viruses or bacteria, and is a leading cause of antibiotic prescription in primary care. The most common bacterial species is group A streptococcus ('strep throat'). Between 50% to 70% of pharyngitis cases are treated with antibiotics, despite the majority of cases being viral in origin. One strategy to reduce antibiotics is to use rapid tests for group A streptococcus to guide antibiotic prescriptions. Rapid tests can be used alone or in combination with a clinical scoring system.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of strategies based on rapid tests to guide antibiotic prescriptions for sore throat in primary care settings.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and LILACS, as well as the trial registries ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP on 5 June 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing rapid tests with management based on clinical grounds to guide the prescription of antibiotics for people with a sore throat in ambulatory care settings. We included trials that randomised individuals, as well as cluster-RCTs in which individual practitioners (or practices) or emergency departments were randomised.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data on the primary outcomes (number of participants provided with an antibiotic prescription; number of participants with an antibiotic dispensed) and secondary outcomes (duration of sore throat symptoms; duration of other symptoms; quality of life measures; number of participants with a complication attributed to the index infection; number of participants in need of re-consultation by the end of follow-up; number of participants in need of hospital admission by the end of follow-up; number of satisfied participants; number of participants with an adverse event attributed to the rapid test). We assessed the risk of bias of all included trials and used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We performed meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses when feasible.

Main Results

We included five trials (2891 children and adult participants in total; 2545 participants after adjusting for clustering). Management in the intervention group was as follows: in three trials rapid tests were used in combination with a clinical scoring system; in one trial, some physicians were asked to use rapid tests alone, while others were asked to use rapid tests in combination with a clinical scoring system; in one trial, rapid tests were used alone. Based on data from five trials (2545 participants), a large reduction in prescribed antibiotics was found in the rapid test group (481/1197) versus management based on clinical grounds (865/1348), for a summary risk difference (RD) of -25%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -31% to -18%; I² = 62%; moderate-certainty evidence. Estimates of effect on antibiotic prescription rates were stable in various sensitivity analyses. Based on data from two trials (900 people) originating from the same overarching study, the evidence suggests that rapid tests may not reduce dispensed antibiotic treatments: rapid test group (156/445) versus management based on clinical grounds (197/455); summary RD -7%, 95% CI -17% to 2%; I² = 53%; low-certainty evidence. Four trials (2075 participants) reported data on the number of participants with a complication attributed to the index infection; the summary odds ratio (OR) was 0.85, 95% CI 0.03 to 26.65; P = 0.93; I² = 62%; very low-certainty evidence, which means that people in the rapid testing group were less likely to develop complications of the index infection, but the evidence is very uncertain. Two trials (1161 participants) reported on the number of participants in need of re-consultation by the end of follow-up; the summary OR was 1.12, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.21; P = 0.74; I² = 59%; low-certainty evidence, which means that participants in the rapid testing group were more likely to be in need of re-consultation by the end of the study follow-up, but the evidence is uncertain. Lack of data impeded assessment of other secondary outcomes (including safety outcomes) and of sources of heterogeneity. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Rapid testing to guide antibiotic treatment for sore throat in primary care probably reduces antibiotic prescription rates by 25% (absolute risk difference), but may have little or no impact on antibiotic dispensing. More studies are needed to assess the efficacy and safety of rapid test-guided antibiotic prescribing, notably to evaluate patient-centred outcomes and variability across subgroups (e.g. adults versus children).

### Notes from the field: group A streptococcal pharyngitis misdiagnoses at a rural urgent-care clinic – Wyoming, March 2015 [^112GBrZo]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2016). Low credibility.

Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is the most common bacterial cause of pharyngitis, implicated in 20%-30% of pediatric and 5%-15% of adult health care visits for sore throat (1). Along with the sudden onset of throat pain, GAS pharyngitis symptoms include fever, headache, and bilateral tender cervical lymphadenopathy (1,2). Accurate diagnosis and management of GAS pharyngitis is critical for limiting antibiotic overuse and preventing rheumatic fever (2), but distinguishing between GAS and viral pharyngitis clinically is challenging (1). Guidelines for diagnosis and management of GAS pharyngitis have been published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)* (1). IDSA recommends that patients with sore throat be tested for GAS to distinguish between GAS and viral pharyngitis; however, IDSA emphasizes the use of selective testing based on clinical symptoms and signs to avoid identifying GAS carriers rather than acute GAS infections (1). Therefore, testing for GAS usually is not recommended for the following: patients with sore throat and accompanying symptoms (e.g., cough, rhinorrhea) that strongly suggest a viral etiology; children aged < 3 years, because acute rheumatic fever is extremely rare in this age group; and asymptomatic household contacts of patients with GAS pharyngitis (1). IDSA recommends penicillin or amoxicillin as the treatment of choice based on effectiveness and narrow spectrum of activity. To date, penicillin-resistant GAS has never been documented (1).

### Predicting streptococcal pharyngitis in adults in primary care: a systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of symptoms and signs and validation of the Centor score [^115hURyA]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Upper respiratory tract infections such as acute pharyngitis represent a substantial portion of the cases seen in primary care. Although the cause of acute pharyngitis in the majority of patients is viral, approximately 5% to 17% is caused by a bacterial infection, often β-haemolytic streptococci. A number of serotypes of β-haemolytic streptococci can cause pharyngitis in humans, however, antibiotics are only recommended in US and UK guidelines for treating patients with group A β-haemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) pharyngitis. Antibiotics reduce the risk of complications (for example, peritonsillar abscess, bacteraemia, acute glomerulonephritis and rheumatic fever), as well as reducing the duration of symptoms and spread of the disease.

Throat cultures are currently considered to be the 'reference standard' for the diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis. This test has a number of limitations in practice; it is relatively expensive; the laboratory tests take 1–2 days leading to delays in starting treatment; and excessive false positive results in asymptomatic pharyngeal carriers may lead to over treatment. To enhance the appropriate prescribing of antibiotics without performing cultures on all patients a number of clinical prediction rules (CPRs) have been developed over the last 40 years to distinguish streptococcal pharyngitis from pharyngitis by other causes. CPRs are evidence-based tools that allow clinicians to stratify patients according to their probability of having a particular disorder. They can also be used to provide a rational basis for treatment.

### Comparison of clinical prediction rules for management of pharyngitis in settings with limited resources [^11786sZf]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of several clinical prediction rules for culture-positive streptococcal pharyngitis in a single group of patients in a setting in which clinicians routinely treat all cases of pharyngitis presumptively, without laboratory data.

Study Design

A MEDLINE search identified clinical prediction rules for streptococcal pharyngitis in children. Each rule was applied analytically to data from 410 children in Cairo, Egypt with clinical pharyngitis, in whom throat cultures were performed. The diagnostic effectiveness of these rules for predicting a positive culture were assessed and compared.

Results

Seven prediction rules were identified. Of these 7 rules, 4 were developed in North American children, 1 was recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), and 2 were developed in Egypt. In the Cairo children, the WHO rule was the least sensitive, at 12%. The 6 other rules had sensitivities ranging from 81% to 99% and specificities ranging from 4% to 40%; 2 rules seemed to be effective, with diagnostic odds ratios of 5.2 and 6.1.

Conclusions

The prediction rules demonstrated variable diagnostic effectiveness in the Egyptian children. Without laboratory testing, 2 clinical rules detected > 90% of cases of pharyngitis with positive culture for group A streptococcus and reduced overtreatment of culture-negative cases by approximately 40%. Selected clinical prediction rules have useful characteristics in settings of limited resources and need further validation.

### Predicting streptococcal pharyngitis in adults in primary care: a systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of symptoms and signs and validation of the Centor score [^111a2kGX]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The most widely recognised CPR for GABHS pharyngitis is the Centor score. The Centor score consists of four signs and symptoms (Table 1) and is recommended in clinical guidelines from the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine (ACP/ASIM) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US. The ACP/ASIM recommends (a) empirical antibiotic treatment of adults with at least three of four Centor criteria and no treatment for all others; or (b) empirical treatment of adults with all four criteria, rapid antigen detection test (RADT) of patients with three or two criteria, and subsequent treatment of those with positive test results and no treatment for all others. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommend that clinicians consider immediate treatment with antibiotics for patients who have three or more Centor criteria. A modified version of the Centor criteria is also used in New Zealand as part of a guideline for sore throat management.

Table 1
The Centor score

Patients receive a point for the presence or absence of signs and symptoms. Each patient is assigned a score between 0 and 4 which is associated with a post-test probability as calculated by Centor and colleagues. (The post-test probability values presented are the mean of the original probability intervals reported by Centor and colleagues.)

The pretest probability of GABHS pharyngitis is reported to peak between the ages of 5 and 10 years. The prevalence in children is reported to be around 20% to 25% while in adults it is between 5% to 10%. This review will focus on adults (≥ 15 years of age), the age group of the cohort in which the Centor score was derived.

Although a considerable amount of research has already been devoted to streptococcal pharyngitis, it remains unclear which symptoms and signs have the most discriminatory power and whether the most widely recognised rule, the Centor score, is valid in a range of clinical settings. The aim of this systematic review was to analyse the current evidence on the usefulness of individual signs and symptoms in assessing the risk of streptococcal pharyngitis in adults, to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the Centor score as a decision rule for antibiotic treatment (discrimination analysis) and to perform a meta-analysis on validation studies of the Centor score (calibration analysis).

### Review: known, emerging, and remerging pharyngitis pathogens [^116FzKUh]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

GROUP A STREPTOCOCCAL PHARYNGEAL INFECTIONS

Bacteria are the second most common etiology of acute pharyngitis. Infection with β-hemolytic GAS, accounts for 5%–15% and 20%–30% of infections in adults and children, respectively. While acute pharyngitis caused by GAS can also be self-limited and resolve without antibiotic treatment, the clinical course of GAS pharyngitis can be associated with significant postinfectious sequelae and other complications. Inadequately or untreated GAS pharyngitis can lead to both nonsuppurative and/or suppurative complications, especially in children 3–15 years of age. Treatment consists of penicillin or amoxicillin, or for β-lactam allergic individuals, a first-generation cephalosporin, clindamycin, clarithromycin, or azithromycin. Nonsuppurative complications are immune mediated and include poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, acute rheumatic fever, and rheumatic heart disease. Suppurative complications include abscess (brain, peritonsillar region, soft tissues of head and neck), cervical lymphadenitis, mastoiditis, meningitis, otitis media, sinusitis, and rarely septicemia. Based on 2010 estimates of deaths by rheumatic heart disease and other previous deaths by invasive GAS infections, GAS was postulated to be the fifth most lethal pathogen worldwide.

### Participatory medicine: a home score for streptococcal pharyngitis enabled by real-time biosurveillance: a cohort study [^111LrTYn]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Consensus guidelines recommend against testing or treating adults at low risk for group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis.

Objective

To help patients decide when to visit a clinician for the evaluation of sore throat.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

A national chain of retail health clinics.

Patients

71 776 patients aged 15 years or older with pharyngitis who visited a clinic from September 2006 to December 2008.

Measurements

The authors created a score using information from patient-reported clinical variables plus the incidence of local disease and compared it with the Centor score and other traditional scores that require clinician-elicited signs.

Results

If patients aged 15 years or older with sore throat did not visit a clinician when the new score estimated the likelihood of GAS pharyngitis to be less than 10% instead of having clinicians manage their symptoms following guidelines that use the Centor score, 230 000 visits would be avoided in the United States each year and 8500 patients with GAS pharyngitis who would have received antibiotics would not be treated with them.

Limitation

Real-time information about the local incidence of GAS pharyngitis, which is necessary to calculate the new score, is not currently available.

Conclusion

A patient-driven approach to pharyngitis diagnosis that uses this new score could save hundreds of thousands of visits annually by identifying patients at home who are unlikely to require testing or treatment.

### Improving guideline-based streptococcal pharyngitis testing: a quality improvement initiative [^1132zBfv]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Acute pharyngitis is a common diagnosis in ambulatory pediatrics. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guideline for group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis recommends strict criteria for GAS testing to avoid misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment of children who are colonized with group A Streptococcus. We sought to improve adherence to the IDSA guideline for testing and treatment of GAS pharyngitis in a large community pediatrics practice.

Methods

The Model for Improvement was used, and iterative Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles were completed. The quality improvement project was approved for American Board of Pediatrics Part 4 Maintenance of Certification credit. Interventions included provider education, modification of existing office procedure, communication strategies, and patient and family education. Outcomes were assessed by using statistical process control charts.

Results

An absolute reduction in unnecessary GAS testing of 23.5% (from 64% to 40.5%) was observed during the project. Presence of viral symptoms was the primary reason for unnecessary testing. Appropriate antibiotic use for GAS pharyngitis did not significantly change during the project; although, inappropriate use was primarily related to unnecessary testing. At the end of the intervention period, the majority of providers perceived an improvement in their ability to communicate with families about the need for GAS pharyngitis testing and about antibiotic use.

Conclusions

The majority of GAS pharyngitis testing in this practice before intervention was inconsistent with IDSA guideline recommendations. A quality improvement initiative, which was approved for Part 4 Maintenance of Certification credit, led to improvement in guideline-based testing for GAS pharyngitis.

Pharyngitis — laboratory testing and treatment scope states that the results of laboratory tests play a central role in guiding therapeutic decisions and that antimicrobial therapy is warranted only in patients with pharyngitis with a proven bacterial etiology; Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus) is the most common bacterial cause of pharyngitis.

### Severe acute pharyngitis caused by group C Streptococcus [^111CEMN1]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Adult group C beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis has a prevalence of approximately 5%. It can present with a broad spectrum of severity.

Case Report

We report a 30-year-old woman who presented with severe Group C streptococcal pharyngitis.

Discussion

She presented with a 9-day history of progressive symptoms, including fever, sore throat, neck swelling, and recent onset of hoarseness. In the 9 days before the emergency room (ER) presentation, the patient had visited the ER twice complaining of a sore throat. At both visits, the physicians performed rapid antigen strep testing. Each time her test was negative and the physicians recommended symptomatic therapy. Her symptoms continued to worsen leading to her repeat presentation. At this time she had severe pharyngitis with markedly enlarged tonsils. Neck CT excluded peritonsillar abscess. Rapid strep testing was again negative, but her throat culture grew group C beta-hemolytic streptococcus.

Conclusion

This presentation illustrates the importance of a systematic approach to evaluating patients with negative rapid strep tests and worsening pharyngitis.

### Review: current laboratory and point-of-care pharyngitis diagnostic testing and knowledge gaps [^115HMXBa]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

NUCLEIC ACID AMPLIFICATION ASSAY SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY

Current IDSA guidelines primarily focus upon the diagnosis and treatment of GAS to prevent both suppurative (extension of infection into the head and neck region) and nonsuppurative (immune-mediated acute rheumatic fever or poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis) complications. Throat swab culture, the most frequently used confirmatory method for negative RADTs, has a turnaround of 24 to 48 hours, which delays diagnosis and patient management. Despite being the reference standard, as recommended by IDSA, throat swab culture is not without limitations. First, the quality of specimen collection is critical for optimal test results. In brief, 1 or 2 sterile swabs (1 for the antigen test and 1 for culture if necessary) should be used to swab between the tonsillar pillars and behind the uvula, while avoiding contact with the tongue and buccal mucosa. A study investigating dual throat swab collection comparing 2 replicate single swabs demonstrated that utilization of a single swab would have missed 9% to 12% of positives cases due to suboptimal collection technique and/or operator error during laboratory testing. Second, following specimen collection, throat swabs should be placed into transport media (eg, Amies) and expeditiously delivered to the laboratory. Transportation delays exceeding 24 hours decrease bacteria viability and increase the chance of false-negative test results. Third, technical expertise is required of laboratory personnel to appropriately cultivate and identify GAS. Lastly, cultivation of GAS or other possible pathogens does not always equate to active infection and the need for treatment; health care providers must consider the possibility of colonization in conjunction with clinical manifestations of the patient.

### Review: known, emerging, and remerging pharyngitis pathogens [^112sp57W]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The McIsaac score (modified Centor Score) is the most common decision rule used to clinically diagnose GAS pharyngitis and differentiate it from viral pharyngitis. It includes a point system (0–5) for specific criteria as follows: patient age (1, 3–14 years; 0, 15–44 years; −1, ≥ 45 years), tonsillar swelling/exudate (1, present; 0, absent), tender/swollen anterior cervical lymph nodes (1, present; 0, absent), temperature (1, > 38°C; 0, < 38°C), and cough (1, absent; 0, present). Point totals are used to recommend actions: 0–1, no testing or antibiotics; 2–3, perform rapid antigen and/or culture testing; ≥ 4, consider rapid antigen and/or culture testing, acceptable to prescribe empiric antibiotics. Outcome measures from a large meta-analysis (206 870 patients) found that for patients 3 years or older, 27% tested positive for GAS. McIsaac scores (95% confidence interval) of positive GAS patients were tallied by percent: 8% (0); 14% (1); 23% (2); 37% (3); and 55% (4). In another study validating the guidelines for management of pharyngitis in both adults and children (n = 787), a McIsaac score of 3 or 4 was associated with a high rate of unnecessary antibiotic use when used without culture or RADTs. As a priority, the medical history and clinical exam should exclude signs/symptoms consistent with complicated GAS pharyngitis, including airway obstruction and invasive disease into neck tissues.

### Antibiotic prescribing and use of corticosteroids for the emergency department management of acute uncomplicated pharyngitis [^113CPKQT]. Family Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute pharyngitis is common in the ambulatory setting. The Modified Centor score uses five criteria to predict Group A Streptococcus (GAS) infection and can be used to guide management.

Objective

The objective of this study was to describe the emergency department (ED) management (throat cultures, antibiotics and corticosteroids) of acute, uncomplicated pharyngitis by Centor score.

Methods

This was a retrospective chart review of adult (> 17 years) patients with an ED discharge diagnosis of acute pharyngitis from January 2016 to December 2018.

Results

Of 638 patients included, 286 (44.8%) had a Centor score of 0–1, 328 (51.4%) had a score of 2–3 and 24 (3.8%) had a score of ≥ 4. Of those with a Centor score of 0–1, 83 (29.0%) had a throat culture, 88 (30.8%) were prescribed antibiotics, 15 (5.2%) were positive for GAS and 74 (25.9%) received corticosteroids. Of those with a Centor score of 2–3, 156 (47.6%) had a throat culture, 220 (67.1%) were prescribed antibiotics, 44 (13.4%) were positive for GAS and 145 (44.2%) received corticosteroids. Of those with a Centor score ≥ 4, 14 (58.3%) had a throat culture, 18 (75.0%) were prescribed antibiotics, 7 (29.2%) were positive for GAS and 12 (50.0%) received corticosteroids.

Conclusions

A higher Centor score was associated with a higher risk of GAS infection, increased antibiotic prescribing and use of corticosteroids. Many patients with low Centor scores were prescribed antibiotics and had throat cultures. Further work is required to understand clinical decision-making for the management of acute pharyngitis.

### Predicting streptococcal pharyngitis in adults in primary care: a systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of symptoms and signs and validation of the Centor score [^114Vz68L]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Individual symptoms and signs have only a modest ability to rule in or out a diagnosis of GABHS pharyngitis. The Centor score uses a combination of signs and symptoms to predict the risk of GABHS pharyngitis; the score is well calibrated across a variety of countries and settings. It has reasonably good specificity, and can enhance the appropriate prescribing of antibiotics, but should be used with caution in low prevalence settings of GABHS pharyngitis such as primary care.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^113udCba]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Additional observation for persistent onset acute bacterial sinusitis — The guideline recommends either antibiotic therapy or an additional brief period of observation as initial management for children with persistent acute bacterial sinusitis, noting benefits to antibiotic therapy (number needed to treat, 3–5) while some children improve on their own and the risk of suppurative complications is low; benefits must also be balanced against an increased risk of adverse events (number need to harm, 3). Choosing between antibiotic therapy or additional observation presents an opportunity for shared decision-making with families. Children with persistent acute bacterial sinusitis who received antibiotic therapy in the previous 4 weeks, those with concurrent bacterial infection (pneumonia, suppurative cervical adenitis, group A streptococcal pharyngitis, or acute otitis media), those with actual or suspected complications, or those with underlying conditions should generally be managed with antibiotic therapy; the latter group includes children with asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunodeficiency, previous sinus surgery, or anatomic abnormalities of the upper respiratory tract. Limiting antibiotic use in children who may improve on their own reduces common antibiotic-related adverse events, and in the most recent RCT adverse events were 44% with antibiotic and 14% with placebo.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^11412YyT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Pharyngitis — Streptococcus pyogenes testing: In children, negative rapid antigen tests for S. pyogenes should be confirmed by culture or molecular assay. For adults, guidelines suggest that either conventional culture or confirmation of negative rapid antigen tests by culture should be used to achieve maximal sensitivity for S. pyogenes pharyngitis. Laboratories accredited by the College of American Pathologists are required to back up negative rapid antigen tests with culture according to the FDA labeling of the tests. Rapid, CLIA‑waived molecular group A strep tests provide improved sensitivity and may not require culture confirmation, although they have not yet been incorporated into consensus guidelines.

### Accuracy and interobserver variation of three clinical decision rules for the diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis [^115GTgCn]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2013). Low credibility.

We evaluated the accuracy and interobserver variation of 3 clinical decision rules for streptoccocal pharyngitis diagnosis. Oropharyngeal swab culture was the reference. The Abu Reesh rule had the highest sensitivity and the World Health Organization rule showed the highest specificity. The interobserver variation of those rules indicates the need for better training of clinicians.

### Diagnosis and antibiotic treatment of group a streptococcal pharyngitis in children in a primary care setting: impact of point-of-care polymerase chain reaction [^1115y1k4]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis based on clinical symptoms alone is not recommended. The use of point-of-care (POC) rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) to test throat-swab specimens obtained in the clinic can help diagnose GAS pharyngitis with the convenience of rapid turnaround times (e.g. < 10 min); however, the overall sensitivity of these tests (70–90%) is low. Thus, current treatment guidelines for the diagnosis of acute pharyngitis in children recommend the use of RADTs of throat-swab specimens plus confirmatory bacterial culture in the case of negative results. Although highly accurate (90–95% sensitivity) when performed correctly, bacterial cultures are labor intensive and require additional infrastructure for sample transport to a separate laboratory and experienced staff to grow and test the bacteria – these factors can delay result reporting to the clinic by 48–72 h. In addition, data have shown that the sensitivity of diagnostic culture conducted as part of routine clinical care is widely variable and lower than that observed with reference culture implemented in clinical trials. Despite clear recommendations for diagnostic testing to confirm GAS, a recent analysis of US claims data found that ≈ 25% of patients with pharyngitis receive no diagnostic testing and have high rates of empiric treatment (57.1%).

In recent years, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) have received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for diagnosing GAS pharyngitis, including several polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. The sensitivity and specificity of PCR assays are similar to those of bacterial reference culture, but PCR has better turnaround times – minutes to hours compared with days. PCR has been implemented into pharyngitis treatment algorithms, as both a confirmatory method to replace culture and as a single test to eliminate the 2-step algorithm. In 2015, the FDA approved the first Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments–waived PCR test for GAS for in-office POC use (cobas Strep A nucleic acid test for use on the cobas Liat System; Roche Molecular Systems, Pleasanton, CA); this system targets a segment of the S. pyogenes genome to produce test results within 15 min in a clinic setting, offers sensitivity and specificity equivalent to and potentially improved over current diagnostic testing procedures, and eliminates the need for confirmatory culture.

### Group A Streptococcus pharyngitis in children: new perspectives on rapid diagnostic testing and antimicrobial stewardship [^1163LxNj]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Medium credibility.

The most common cause of bacterial pharyngitis is Group A Streptococcus (GAS). Accurate diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis is crucial to identify children who would benefit from antibiotic treatment. Rapid diagnosis has the potential to reduce antibiotic overuse. Current national guidelines differ in their recommendations for GAS testing. While rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) are widely used, their sensitivity is considered too low for stand-alone testing by several expert bodies. Newer molecular tests using nucleic acid amplification show higher accuracy and fast results, but their cost, complexity, and very high sensitivity may limit widespread adoption. This review provides up-to-date evidence regarding rapid diagnostic testing and antimicrobial stewardship in children with sore throat. We discuss discrepancies across GAS testing guidelines at the international level, patient selection for testing for GAS, rapid test accuracy, and the potential role of rapid GAS tests to promote antibiotic stewardship, with emphasis on emerging rapid molecular tests.

### Empirical validation of guidelines for the management of pharyngitis in children and adults [^112cCYhB]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

The clinical calculator "Modified Centor (McIsaac) score for streptococcal pharyngitis" for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, PFAPA syndrome and diphtheria.

The Modified Centor Score, also known as the McIsaac Score, is a clinical decision tool used in the assessment of patients presenting with sore throat. It is specifically designed to predict the likelihood of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis, a common cause of throat infection.

The score is applicable to both pediatric and adult populations, but it is particularly useful in primary care settings where rapid strep testing may not be readily available. The Modified Centor Score helps clinicians decide whether to treat a sore throat with antibiotics or not, based on the probability of a streptococcal infection.

The score takes into account five factors: patient's age, presence of fever, absence of cough, swollen and tender cervical lymph nodes, and tonsillar swelling or exudate. Each factor contributes to the total score, which ranges from -1 to 5.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the Modified Centor Score, but it should be noted that it is not designed to predict other causes of pharyngitis, and should not replace clinical judgment. It is also less accurate in populations where the prevalence of GAS pharyngitis is very low or very high.

The Modified Centor Score is a tool used to evaluate the likelihood of streptococcal throat infection, guiding decisions on testing and treatment. It considers five clinical factors, assigning a score to each based on predefined criteria.

To calculate the score, input the following details for a patient:

1. **Age**

- **3–14 years**: Score 1
- **15–44 years**: Score 0
- **45 years or older**: Score 1

2. **Tonsillar exudate or swelling**

- **Yes**: Score 1
- **No**: Score 0

3. **Tender or swollen anterior cervical lymph nodes**

- **Yes**: Score 1
- **No**: Score 0

4. **Temperature greater than 38°C (100.4°F)**

- **Yes**: Score 1
- **No**: Score 0

5. **Presence of cough**

- **Yes**: Score 0
- **No**: Score 1

Add up the scores from these categories to get a total score between 0 and 5.

Interpret the total score to determine the appropriate clinical action:

- **0 points**: An estimated 1–2.5% risk of streptococcal infection; no further testing or antibiotics are necessary.
- **1 point**: A risk of 5–10%; again, no need for further testing or antibiotics.
- **2 points**: Risk rises to 11–17%; consider conducting a rapid test or throat culture.
- **3 points**: The risk increases to 28–35%; rapid test or culture should be considered.
- **4 or more points**: Significant risk of 51–53%; empiric antibiotics and/or rapid testing or culture are recommended.

This scoring method helps in assessing streptococcal infection risk and aids in clinical decision-making regarding testing and treatment.

### Efficacy of an evidence-based clinical decision support in primary care practices: a randomized clinical trial [^111CGYfK]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Importance

There is consensus that incorporating clinical decision support into electronic health records will improve quality of care, contain costs, and reduce overtreatment, but this potential has yet to be demonstrated in clinical trials.

Objective

To assess the influence of a customized evidence-based clinical decision support tool on the management of respiratory tract infections and on the effectiveness of integrating evidence at the point of care.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In a randomized clinical trial, we implemented 2 well-validated integrated clinical prediction rules, namely, the Walsh rule for streptococcal pharyngitis and the Heckerling rule for pneumonia. INTERVENTIONS AND MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The intervention group had access to the integrated clinical prediction rule tool and chose whether to complete risk score calculators, order medications, and generate progress notes to assist with complex decision making at the point of care.

Results

The intervention group completed the integrated clinical prediction rule tool in 57.5% of visits. Providers in the intervention group were significantly less likely to order antibiotics than the control group (age-adjusted relative risk, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.60–0.92). The absolute risk of the intervention was 9.2%, and the number needed to treat was 10.8. The intervention group was significantly less likely to order rapid streptococcal tests compared with the control group (relative risk, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.58–0.97; p = 0.03).

Conclusions and Relevance

The integrated clinical prediction rule process for integrating complex evidence-based clinical decision report tools is of relevant importance for national initiatives, such as Meaningful Use. TRIAL REGISTRATION clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01386047.

### Review: current laboratory and point-of-care pharyngitis diagnostic testing and knowledge gaps [^115xKwGu]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial resistance, especially to commonly prescribed antibiotics, is increasing both domestically and abroad. In the United States, approximately half of antibiotic prescriptions for acute respiratory conditions such as pharyngitis have been deemed unnecessary as the etiology is most commonly viral. For pharyngitis, the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommends health care providers test for group A Streptococcus (GAS) using rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs). However, due to suboptimal sensitivity, negative RADTs must be backed up by throat culture in patients aged 3–21 years (for others, culture confirmation is optional). Many clinicians choose not to wait an additional 24–48 hours for culture results and prescribe "just in case" antibiotics. New Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-waived, rapid nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for GAS, which can be performed at the point of care (POC), may reduce the need for culture confirmation of negative RADTs. Recent studies have verified the high sensitivity and specificity of rapid NAATs when compared to conventional culture and RADT methods. These new tools may improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce the time to appropriate treatment.

### A rare sequela of untreated Streptococcus pharyngitis: a case report [^114NUwwQ]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Pharyngitis is commonly caused by the gram positive bacteria, streptococcus. Given the potential morbid complications of untreated streptococcal pharyngitis, antibiotics are critical. One of the rarer complications is pulmonary‐renal syndrome (PRS), defined as rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. PRS is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, making swift diagnosis and treatment imperative for survival. More common causes of PRS are tied to autoimmune diseases. This case describes a novel progression of PRS caused by streptococcus.

A 26‐year‐old male with no significant medical history presented to our emergency department with streptococcal group A‐positive sore throat. After discontinuing amoxicillin due to pruritus, the patient returned one month later with persisting hematuria and dysuria, diagnosed with post‐streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Despite receiving another antibiotic prescription, it was not filled. He returned six days later with worsening symptoms, leading to ICU admission due to hemoptysis requiring subsequent intubation. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage was confirmed with bronchial washings. Negative autoimmune laboratory results and clinical symptoms suggest streptococcal pharyngitis induced pulmonary‐renal syndrome.

Although only the sixth case of streptococcal induced PRS, it is imperative to consider when treating patients with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, due to its possible mortality. Prompt recognition and treatment with pulse steroids and plasmapheresis is crucial for PRS resolution. Laryngoscope, 135:1940–1942, 2025

### Guideline for the management of acute sore throat [^1174zw4c]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2012). Low credibility.

The European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases established the Sore Throat Guideline Group to write an updated guideline to diagnose and treat patients with acute sore throat. In diagnosis, Centor clinical scoring system or rapid antigen test can be helpful in targeting antibiotic use. The Centor scoring system can help to identify those patients who have higher likelihood of group A streptococcal infection. In patients with high likelihood of streptococcal infections (e.g. 3–4 Centor criteria) physicians can consider the use of rapid antigen test (RAT). If RAT is performed, throat culture is not necessary after a negative RAT for the diagnosis of group A streptococci. To treat sore throat, either ibuprofen or paracetamol are recommended for relief of acute sore throat symptoms. Zinc gluconate is not recommended to be used in sore throat. There is inconsistent evidence of herbal treatments and acupuncture as treatments for sore throat. Antibiotics should not be used in patients with less severe presentation of sore throat, e.g. 0–2 Centor criteria to relieve symptoms. Modest benefits of antibiotics, which have been observed in patients with 3–4 Centor criteria, have to be weighed against side effects, the effect of antibiotics on microbiota, increased antibacterial resistance, medicalisation and costs. The prevention of suppurative complications is not a specific indication for antibiotic therapy in sore throat. If antibiotics are indicated, penicillin V, twice or three times daily for 10 days is recommended. At the present, there is no evidence enough that indicates shorter treatment length.

### Diagnostic test accuracy of simplified algorithms for diagnosing acute rheumatic fever: a systematic review [^112Lyq2s]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The following unresolved research questions and areas of future research were identified by this systematic review to inform the new World Health Organization guideline on ARF and RHD:
There is a variable capacity to apply the modified Jones criteria in a highly endemic area of ARF. Improvement of ARF diagnostic accuracy may face challenges due to a lack of availability and access to laboratory investigations and echocardiography in such areas.
Further research is required on more specific biomarkers to diagnose ARF or that can act as supplementary diagnostic criteria to modify the Jones criteria to increase the criteria's specificity and sensitivity.
More data are needed on the possibility of categorizing suspected ARF cases into categories based on diagnostic certainty and following a management pathway specific to each category.
The development of multiparametric risk scores to bridge this knowledge gap should conform to established methodologies, such as the TRIPOD framework.
The meticulous exclusion of differential diagnoses remains crucial for refining the accuracy of the modified Jones criteria.
Use of diagnostic aids, such as apps, to make the criteria more user-friendly and easier to use, and facilitating the use of more elaborate criteria needs to be tested. This approach can potentially pave the way for more complex decision flowcharts, shifting away the focus from criteria simplification.

The scarcity of studies meeting the inclusion criteria is a limitation of this review that needs to be highlighted. Due to the presence of different algorithms, each of which was only used in a single study, we were unable to conduct a meta-analysis. A future update of this review may allow circumvent some of the uncertainty and limitations in our findings. Furthermore, reporting of data per age group should be encouraged in future publications, so sub-analyses may become feasible.

In conclusion, ARF remains frequently underdiagnosed, highlighting the need for a simple and broadly applicable approach that can detect the vast majority of cases. Although simplified algorithms that omit echocardiography and laboratory testing have shown suboptimal performance, even the modified Jones criteria have limitations (some patients who do not meet the criteria for a definite ARF diagnosis may still progress to RHD). This highlights a critical gap in current diagnostic methods. Further research is needed to identify reliable clinical and/or biochemical markers for ARF, particularly in endemic regions, to improve diagnostic accuracy and prevent progression to RHD. Additionally, the use of antibiotics in populations at moderate to high risk of ARF and RHD with suspected streptococcal pharyngitis may be of importance for reducing the burden of ARF.

### Reflexive culture in adolescents and adults with group A streptococcal pharyngitis [^115WSrmn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines currently provide conflicting recommendations regarding the diagnosis of group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis in adults. Clinical guidelines state that negative rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) do not require confirmation by a backup method in adults, whereas laboratory-based guidelines mandate confirmation of a negative RADT in patients of all ages. The objective of this study was to assess the utility of reflexive culture following a negative RADT in adolescents and adults with suspected GAS pharyngitis.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of 726 patients, aged ≥ 13 years, with negative RADTs and positive GAS throat cultures, was performed between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2011 at 2 academic medical centers in Seattle, Washington. Complication rates, treatment, modified Centor score, and bacterial burden in patients with negative RADTs and positive GAS throat cultures were assessed.

Results

Modified Centor scores ≥ 2 were observed in 55% of patients with a negative RADT and positive GAS culture. Of these, 77% of patients had a moderate or heavy bacterial burden (≥ 2+). RADTs failed to detect some patients who presented with serious complications of GAS pharyngitis: 29 (4.0%) had peritonsillar abscesses and 2 (0.28%) were diagnosed with acute rheumatic fever. Providers found culture results to be useful for initiating antibiotic therapy or confirming a clinical diagnosis. Antibiotic treatment was prescribed in 68.7% of patients, with culture-directed initiation of therapy documented in 43.5%.

Conclusions

Reflexive GAS culture is clinically useful when RADTs are negative. RADTs fail to detect a substantial number of adult patients with clinically significant pharyngitis who can benefit from treatment.

### The cape town clinical decision rule for streptococcal pharyngitis in children [^116Pfcoc]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Existing clinical decision rules (CDRs) to diagnose group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis have not been validated in sub-Saharan Africa. We developed a locally applicable CDR while evaluating existing CDRs for diagnosing GAS pharyngitis in South African children.

Methods

We conducted a prospective cohort study and enrolled 997 children 3–15 years of age presenting to primary care clinics with a complaint of sore throat, and whose parents provided consent. Main outcome measures were signs and symptoms of pharyngitis and a positive GAS culture from a throat swab. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to develop the CDR. In addition, the diagnostic effectiveness of 6 existing rules for predicting a positive culture in our cohort was assessed.

Results

A total of 206 of 982 children (21%) had a positive GAS culture. Tonsillar swelling, tonsillar exudates, tender or enlarged anterior cervical lymph nodes, absence of cough and absence of rhinorrhea were associated with positive cultures in bivariate and multivariate analyses. Four variables (tonsillar swelling and one of tonsillar exudate, no rhinorrhea, no cough), when used in a cumulative score, showed 83.7% sensitivity and 32.2% specificity for GAS pharyngitis. Of existing rules tested, the rule by McIsaac et al had the highest positive predictive value (28%), but missed 49% of the culture-positive children who should have been treated.

Conclusion

The new 4-variable CDR for GAS pharyngitis (ie, tonsillar swelling and one of tonsillar exudate, no rhinorrhea, no cough) outperformed existing rules for GAS pharyngitis diagnosis in children with symptomatic sore throat in Cape Town.

### Adherence to guidelines for testing and treatment of children with pharyngitis: a retrospective study [^112F1vk7]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design and criteria

We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients seen at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) who had a RADT and/or streptococcal throat culture performed in an outpatient setting (hospital-affiliated primary care or urgent care clinic or emergency department [ED]) from August 1, 2011 to July 31, 2012. The first 50 patients meeting inclusion criteria in each month of the study period were evaluated. Patients were excluded if they were < 3 or > 18 years of age, were diagnosed with another bacterial infection during the visit, had a medical condition likely to cause deviation from typical pharyngitis management (e.g. neutropenia, airway compromise), were already taking antibiotics, or had been treated for GAS pharyngitis within the previous 30 days. Patients were also excluded if there was no visit documentation associated with the test; these included patients seen at local pediatric offices that use the BCH laboratory but have separate medical record systems. Information was obtained through review of chart documentation, including notes, vital signs, lab results, and prescriptions. The study was approved by the Committee on Clinical Investigation at BCH.

Data collection

Data abstracted from medical records included information about the visit (month, day of week, time, and location), the patient (age, gender, antibiotic allergies, comorbid illnesses, reason(s) for visit, maximum reported temperature in the previous 48 h, history of cough, concurrent antibiotics, and treatment for GAS pharyngitis within the previous 30 days), physical exam findings (temperature, tonsillar exudate and/or enlargement, cervical lymphadenopathy), test results (RADT, throat culture), and management (including antibiotic prescription details). Statements regarding treatment and management decisions were also recorded.

### The impact of national guidelines on the diagnostics of sore throat in children [^113kQ7Qw]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute pharyngitis is a common reason for seeking medical advice. The majority of pharyngitis cases are caused by viruses, and approximately 24–37% of children's pharyngitis is caused by Group A β-haemolytic streptococci (GAS). In high-income countries, rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease are rare complications of GAS infections, but they still impose a large disease burden in low-income countries. GAS pharyngitis can lead to suppurative complications, such as peritonsillar and retropharyngeal abscess, as well as toxin-mediated complications, scarlet fever, and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. These complications are rare in high-income countries, and GAS is usually self-limited; therefore, antibiotic treatment should not be started to only prevent suppurative complications or relieve symptoms in patients with mild symptoms.

The Finnish treatment guidelines for sore throat were updated in June 2020, and the Centor score was presented as a diagnostic tool for GAS pharyngitis. According to the Centor criteria, one point is given for each of the following symptoms and clinical findings: absence of cough, tender and swollen submandibular lymph nodes, tonsillar exudate or swollen tonsils, and fever ≥ 38˚C. In the guideline update Centor score is recommended to use to direct antibiotic treatment to patients with more severe symptoms and higher likelihood of GAS. Patients with mild symptoms and Centor score (0–2) are recommended to be treated symptomatically and patients with severe symptoms (3–4) are recommended to be treated based on microbiological test results. A new guideline for microbiological testing of GAS was also provided. The new guidelines recommend using a rapid antigen detection test in patients with a Centor score of 3 or more. Throat culture should only be used in patients with prolonged symptoms or in epidemic situations. The guidelines also recommend against using C-reactive protein (CRP) tests in the diagnosis of pharyngitis, as they are ineffective at distinguishing viral from bacterial pathogens.

The aim of this study was to determine how the publication of the updated Finnish Current Care Guidelines affected treatment for pediatric patients, particularly the use of the Centor criteria, CRP tests, and microbiological testing in the diagnosis of GAS tonsillitis.

### Improved diagnostic accuracy of group A streptococcal pharyngitis with use of real-time biosurveillance [^114jiZ7o]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical prediction rules do not incorporate real-time incidence data to adjust estimates of disease risk in symptomatic patients.

Objective

To measure the value of integrating local incidence data into a clinical decision rule for diagnosing group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis in patients aged 15 years or older.

Design

Retrospective analysis of clinical and biosurveillance predictors of GAS pharyngitis.

Setting

Large U.S.-based retail health chain.

Patients

82 062 patient visits for pharyngitis.

Measurements

Accuracy of the Centor score was compared with that of a biosurveillance-responsive score, which was essentially an adjusted Centor score based on real-time GAS pharyngitis information from the 14 days before a patient's visit: the recent local proportion positive (RLPP).

Results

Increased RLPP correlated with the likelihood of GAS pharyngitis (r(2) = 0.79; P < 0.001). Local incidence data enhanced diagnostic models. For example, when the RLPP was greater than 0.30, managing patients with Centor scores of 1 as if the scores were 2 would identify 62, 537 previously missed patients annually while misclassifying 18, 446 patients without GAS pharyngitis. Decreasing the score of patients with Centor values of 3 by 1 point for an RLPP less than 0.20 would spare unnecessary antibiotics for 166, 616 patients while missing 18, 812 true-positive cases.

Limitations

Analyses were conducted retrospectively. Real-time regional data on GAS pharyngitis are generally not yet available to clinicians.

Conclusion

Incorporating live biosurveillance data into clinical guidelines for GAS pharyngitis and other communicable diseases should be considered for reducing missed cases when the contemporaneous incidence is elevated and for sparing unnecessary antibiotics when the contemporaneous incidence is low. Delivering epidemiologic data to the point of care will enable the use of real-time pretest probabilities in medical decision making.

### Diagnosis and antibiotic treatment of group a streptococcal pharyngitis in children in a primary care setting: impact of point-of-care polymerase chain reaction [^115RyYmj]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the use of the POC PCR cobas Liat Strep A test in a large pediatric clinic increased the rates of accurately diagnosing GAS pharyngitis, provided results at the time of the clinic visit, and reduced inappropriate antibiotic prescribing compared with the recommended current treatment paradigm of RADT plus reflex culture. The American Society for Microbiology has recommended that clinics redesign their office workflow to incorporate POC testing. Additionally, PCR-based GAS pharyngitis testing, while not currently recommended in treatment guidelines, may produce results on par with gold standard laboratory testing; incorporation of PCR-based methods into practice guidelines could inform providers of the benefits of these methods and encourage their use. Thus, the use of POC PCR to diagnose GAS pharyngitis should be considered to improve patient care and office/provider efficiency.

### Predicting streptococcal pharyngitis in adults in primary care: a systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of symptoms and signs and validation of the Centor score [^116z9sdu]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Stratifying patients with a sore throat into the probability of having an underlying bacterial or viral cause may be helpful in targeting antibiotic treatment. We sought to assess the diagnostic accuracy of signs and symptoms and validate a clinical prediction rule (CPR), the Centor score, for predicting group A β-haemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) pharyngitis in adults (> 14 years of age) presenting with sore throat symptoms.

Methods

A systematic literature search was performed up to July 2010. Studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of signs and symptoms and/or validated the Centor score were included. For the analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of signs and symptoms and the Centor score, studies were combined using a bivariate random effects model, while for the calibration analysis of the Centor score, a random effects model was used.

Results

A total of 21 studies incorporating 4,839 patients were included in the meta-analysis on diagnostic accuracy of signs and symptoms. The results were heterogeneous and suggest that individual signs and symptoms generate only small shifts in post-test probability (range positive likelihood ratio (+LR) 1.45–2.33, -LR 0.54–0.72). As a decision rule for considering antibiotic prescribing (score ≥ 3), the Centor score has reasonable specificity (0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.88) and a post-test probability of 12% to 40% based on a prior prevalence of 5% to 20%. Pooled calibration shows no significant difference between the numbers of patients predicted and observed to have GABHS pharyngitis across strata of Centor score (0–1 risk ratio (RR) 0.72, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.06; 2–3 RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.17; 4 RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.37).

Conclusions

Individual signs and symptoms are not powerful enough to discriminate GABHS pharyngitis from other types of sore throat. The Centor score is a well calibrated CPR for estimating the probability of GABHS pharyngitis. The Centor score can enhance appropriate prescribing of antibiotics, but should be used with caution in low prevalence settings of GABHS pharyngitis such as primary care.

### Clinical guidance for group A streptococcal pharyngitis… [^112ACtFT]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Many pathogens can cause pharyngitis.
- Patients with clear viral symptoms don't need testing for group A streptococcal bacteria.
- Confirm a negative rapid antigen detection test with a throat culture for symptomatic children aged 3 years or older.
- Treat group A streptococcal pharyngitis with antibiotics.
- Follow recommended guidelines when caring for patients with group A streptococcal pharyngitis. Diagnosis Differential diagnosis The differential diagnosis of acute pharyngitis includes multiple viral and bacterial pathogens. Viruses are the most common cause of pharyngitis in all age groups. Experts estimate that group A strep, the most common bacterial cause, causes
- 20% to 30% of pharyngitis episodes in children
- 5% to 15% of pharyngitis infections in adults Clinical examination only with viral symptoms Healthcare providers can use history and clinical examination to diagnose viral pharyngitis when clear viral symptoms are present.

These patients don't need testing for group A strep bacteria. Testing and diagnosis To confirm group A strep pharyngitis, healthcare providers can use either
- A rapid antigen detection test
- Throat culture RADTs have high specificity for group A strep bacteria but varying sensitivities when compared to throat culture. Throat culture is the gold standard diagnostic test. Negative RADT Children older than 3 years: Healthcare providers should follow up a negative RADT with a throat culture. Have a mechanism in place to contact the family and initiate antibiotics if the back-up throat culture is positive. Giving antibiotics to children with confirmed group A strep pharyngitis can reduce their risk of developing acute rheumatic fever. All other ages: Throat culture after a negative RADT isn't routinely indicated. Acute rheumatic fever is very rare in these age groups.

Prevention Hand hygiene Good hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette can reduce the spread of group A strep bacteria. Antibiotic treatment Treatment with an appropriate antibiotic for 12 hours or longer limits a person's ability to transmit group A strep bacteria. People with group A strep pharyngitis should stay home from work, school, or daycare until both of the following are met:

- They are afebrile
- At least 12–24 hours after starting appropriate antibiotic therapyA.

### About strep throat | Group A strep… [^115fzMKu]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Strep throat is a bacterial infection in the throat and tonsils.
- Healthcare providers can do a quick test to see if a sore throat is strep throat.
- Antibiotics can help people with strep throat feel better faster.
- Speak with a healthcare provider if you have concerns about strep throat. Symptoms It usually takes 2 to 5 days after exposure to become ill with strep throat. Common symptoms may include:

- Fever
- Pain when swallowing
- Red and swollen tonsils
- Sore throat that started very quickly and may look red
- Swollen lymph nodes in the front of the neck
- Tiny, red spots on the roof of the mouth, called petechiae
- White patches or streaks of pus on the tonsils. Less common symptoms, especially for children, may include:

- Headache
- Nausea or vomiting
- Rash
- Stomach pain Complications Complications can occur after a strep throat infection if the bacteria spread to other parts of the body.

Complications can include:

- Abscesses around the tonsils or in the neck
- Ear infections
- Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis
- Rheumatic fever
- Sinus infections. Causes Group A Streptococcus cause strep throat and are contagious.

### Diagnosing and treating strep throat… [^114EJvDZ]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

1 In the example cited, the patient's score is 5, meaning there is a 52-percent chance that he has streptococcal pharyngitis. The author notes that it would be reasonable to treat him for this, but another interpretation is that the likelihood of the patient having streptococcal infection is no better than chance alone. Accordingly, there is good reason to recommend a specific microbiologic test, such as a rapid diagnostic assay or a conventional throat culture, as a guide to therapeutic decisions. Some of the more sensitive rapid tests can provide an answer with an 80-to 85-percent certainty within 15 minutes. Given that group A streptococcus causes only about 20 percent of pharyngitis episodes in children and 10 percent in adults, this seems like a more prudent approach, especially given concerns about the overuse of antibiotics. We also have concern about including antibiotics other than first-line antibiotics in a patient flow sheet for management of pharyngitis.

This implies that these are appropriate initial choices for management of pharyngitis due to group A streptococcus. Unless the patient is allergic to penicillin, either amoxicillin or penicillin remains the drug of choice for this condition. These recommendations reflect the current guidelines endorsed by the Committee on Infectious Diseases of the American Academy of Pediatrics. 2 It would be in the best interest of all children to establish consistent, high-quality practice recommendations from the AAP and the AAFP. Author's response: As I state in the article, another option for high-risk patients other than empiric antibiotics is "to base treatment on the results of a rapid strep test, or to obtain a throat culture and call the patient in two days with the results. If the culture is negative, you could discontinue antibiotics, recognizing the potential for false-negative culture results when the pretest probability is sufficiently high".

Given the limited accuracy of rapid antigen tests, if a patient has a high risk of strep based on the McIsaac rule and a negative rapid antigen test, he or she still has approximately a 15-percent risk of streptococcal pharyngitis. I would argue that empiric therapy should be an option, particularly when other factors increase the risk of strep even further. This recommendation is consistent with an evidence-based guideline that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has endorsed.
