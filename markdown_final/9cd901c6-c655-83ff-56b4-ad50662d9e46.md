## Question

47 yo F with longstanding SLE, on chronic hydroxychloroquine and prednisone, presents with new-onset atrial fibrillation (HR 115, BP 118/72) and is planned for elective electrical cardioversion. Labs: Mg 1.9, K 4.2, Cr 0.9, normal TSH, no signs of infection or volume overload. Anticoagulation appropriate. Cardiology orders single-dose intravenous ibutilide for pharmacologic cardioversion prior to electricity—proceed with ibutilide as ordered?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether to proceed with intravenous ibutilide for pharmacologic cardioversion in a 47-year-old woman with longstanding SLE, new-onset atrial fibrillation, and chronic therapy with hydroxychloroquine and prednisone, given her electrolytes and planned elective cardioversion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the indication and appropriateness of ibutilide for pharmacologic cardioversion in stable AF. Then, I should verify absolute and relative contraindications, especially QT risk and drug interactions. Next, I will review electrolyte thresholds and monitoring requirements. After that, I need to consider SLE-specific and steroid-related risks that could modify the decision. Finally, I will weigh alternatives and outline a practical, safety-focused recommendation with dosing and monitoring details.

> Let me first confirm the indication and guideline stance. Ibutilide is reasonable for pharmacologic cardioversion in hemodynamically stable AF without depressed LV function, with expected conversion rates around 30–50% and onset within 30–90 minutes, which fits this patient who is stable and has no reported LV dysfunction, so the indication is sound per ACC/AHA/ACCP guidance [^70c3efd0] [^4005b19e].

> Wait, let me verify contraindications and key safety filters. Ibutilide should be avoided in patients with prolonged QT or QTc> 440 ms, significant bradycardia, severe LVH, low LVEF, or prior torsades, and it carries a dose-related QT prolongation with a 2–7% risk of torsades, which mandates continuous ECG monitoring for at least 4 hours after infusion and readiness to treat ventricular arrhythmias [^70c3efd0] [^1930b84d] [^445fb420].

> I need to check electrolytes carefully. The label and guidelines advise correcting hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia before ibutilide; her potassium is 4.2 mEq/L, which is acceptable, but magnesium at 1.9 mg/dL is borderline low and should be repleted to at least 2.0 mg/dL, ideally 2.2–2.4 mg/dL, to mitigate torsades risk; I should confirm the unit conversion and replete magnesium now rather than assume it is "close enough" [^445fb420] [^63b9682e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about drug interactions. Hydroxychloroquine prolongs the QT interval and is explicitly flagged as a risk when combined with other QT-prolonging agents like ibutilide, with guidance to avoid such combinations or monitor very closely; prednisone can also increase AF risk and may indirectly worsen electrolyte shifts, so the combination raises my concern for additive QT effects and proarrhythmia even with normal baseline QTc [^03e96ead] [^ffcad6ee].

> Let me consider alternatives and the planned pathway. Electrical cardioversion remains highly effective and avoids QT-prolonging drugs entirely; if pharmacologic cardioversion is preferred, amiodarone is a reasonable alternative that does not carry the same torsades risk profile, albeit with slower conversion over 8–12 hours, which could still precede elective DCCV if needed; procainamide is another option in some settings, though it has its own hypotension and QRS widening risks and is less favored for acute conversion in many U.S. practices [^70c3efd0] [^4005b19e] [^63b9682e].

> I should double-check the monitoring and staffing requirements. Ibutilide must be administered with continuous ECG, IV access, and immediate availability of defibrillation and personnel trained to treat sustained VT/VF; if used, I would ensure magnesium is repleted beforehand, obtain a baseline and serial ECGs, and extend monitoring beyond 4 hours if QTc remains prolonged or if any ectopy occurs, given late torsades reports up to several hours post-infusion [^445fb420] [^1930b84d].

> But wait, what if we prioritize safety given the SLE and steroid context? Given the additive QT risk from hydroxychloroquine and the potential electrolyte and autonomic effects of chronic steroids, I would recommend against ibutilide in this scenario and favor proceeding directly to elective electrical cardioversion with appropriate anticoagulation and sedation planning, or using IV amiodarone if a pharmacologic bridge is desired, while correcting magnesium now and ensuring close telemetry if any antiarrhythmic is used [^70c3efd0] [^4005b19e] [^03e96ead].

> If, despite these concerns, ibutilide is still chosen, I need to ensure strict execution: replete magnesium to≥ 2.0 mg/dL, confirm QTc≤ 440 ms, avoid other QT-prolonging agents, use standard dosing of 1 mg IV over 10 minutes with a second 1 mg dose if needed after 10 minutes in patients≥ 60 kg, and monitor continuously for at least 4 hours after infusion with serial ECGs and electrolyte checks; any significant QT prolongation, bradycardia, or ectopy should prompt stopping the infusion and escalating care [^05266b84] [^445fb420] [^1930b84d].

> Final recommendation: Do not proceed with ibutilide as ordered. The balance of risk is unfavorable due to hydroxychloroquine-associated QT prolongation risk, borderline-low magnesium, and chronic steroid exposure, so I would cancel ibutilide and proceed with electrical cardioversion under appropriate anticoagulation and sedation, or alternatively use IV amiodarone if a pharmacologic approach is preferred, while correcting magnesium now and ensuring continuous monitoring if any antiarrhythmic is administered [^70c3efd0] [^4005b19e] [^03e96ead] [^445fb420].

Do not proceed with **ibutilide** in this patient. Ibutilide is **contraindicated with QT-prolonging drugs** such as hydroxychloroquine due to the high risk of torsades de pointes [^03e96ead]. Even with normal QTc, the combination is unsafe. Use **electrical cardioversion** or an alternative agent like amiodarone [^70c3efd0] if pharmacologic cardioversion is needed, and correct magnesium to≥ 2.0 mg/dL before any antiarrhythmic [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacological considerations and risks

- **QT prolongation and torsades risk**: Ibutilide prolongs QT and can cause torsades, especially with other QT-prolonging drugs [^445fb420]; hydroxychloroquine also prolongs QT, so the combination markedly increases torsades risk [^03e96ead].

- **Clinical evidence**: Case reports and guidelines warn against ibutilide with QT-prolonging agents, including hydroxychloroquine, due to proarrhythmia risk [^03e96ead].

- **Magnesium level**: Magnesium 1.9 mg/dL is borderline low; hypomagnesemia increases torsades risk, and ibutilide labeling advises correcting magnesium before use [^445fb420].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines advise **avoiding ibutilide** in patients on QT-prolonging drugs such as hydroxychloroquine because of torsades risk [^03e96ead]. If pharmacologic cardioversion is needed, consider amiodarone or procainamide with close monitoring, and avoid ibutilide in this setting [^70c3efd0] [^398ff827].

---

## Alternative strategies

- **Electrical cardioversion**: Preferred for stable AF when pharmacologic cardioversion is risky or contraindicated; it is effective and avoids QT-prolonging drugs [^528618e3].

- **Amiodarone**: Reasonable for pharmacologic cardioversion when ibutilide is contraindicated; slower conversion but lower torsades risk than ibutilide [^70c3efd0] [^4005b19e].

- **Magnesium correction**: Replete magnesium to≥ 2.0 mg/dL before any antiarrhythmic to reduce torsades risk [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Do not use **ibutilide** in this patient because of the high risk of torsades from interaction with hydroxychloroquine and borderline-low magnesium. Use electrical cardioversion or an alternative agent such as amiodarone, and correct magnesium before any antiarrhythmic therapy [^70c3efd0] [^445fb420].

Ibutilide is an intravenous Class III antidysrhythmic approved for the treatment of recent onset atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. Pharmacological effect occurs within 30 min, and the efficacy approaches 40%. In contrast to DC electrical cardioversion, which requires anesthesia, pharmacologic cardioversion offers an alternative in which sedation can be avoided. Patients receiving ibutilide should be monitored for at least 4 h after completed drug administration because of a small chance of ventricular dysrhythmia, mainly torsades de pointes. Careful patient selection is the key to avoiding dysrhythmic complications. The purpose of this article is to review the mechanisms, clinical applications, potential complications, and appropriate use of ibutilide.

Atrial fibrillation pharmacological cardioversion—drug selection and monitoring notes that vernakalant “allows the rapid restoration of SR in patients with AF (but not in atrial flutter)” and may be administered in mild to moderate heart failure and stable ischaemic heart disease; intravenous flecainide and propafenone are “restricted to patients without altered cardiac substrate.” Ibutilide is an alternative but “is torsadogenic and should be avoided in patients with long QT,” with the “QTc interval … carefully monitored during and immediately after the infusion.” Intravenous amiodarone “was not shown to convert AF acutely in placebo controlled studies,” but in heart failure patients it “slows significantly the heart rate in less than 12 h” and is “superior to intravenous sotalol concerning overall conversions.” Selected outpatients may self-administer an oral bolus of flecainide or propafenone once safety is confirmed in-hospital; this “pill-in-the-pocket” strategy is “marginally less effective than in-hospital cardioversion or continuous AAD therapy” yet “may be preferred by eligible patients.” Pre-treatment with oral antiarrhythmic drugs such as amiodarone, sotalol or ibutilide “may improve the efficacy of electrical cardioversion of AF and/or prevent early AF recurrences,” and SR “may be restored (e.g., during a 3–4 weeks of pre-treatment …).”

### Safety and efficacy of ibutilide in cardioversion of atrial flutter and fibrillation [^d12fafaf]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

This article reviews the safety and efficacy of ibutilide for use in patients with atrial fibrillation and flutter. Ibutilide, a class III antiarrhythmic agent, is primarily used for conversion of atrial flutter and fibrillation and is a good alternative to electrical cardioversion. Ibutilide has a conversion rate of up to 75% to 80% in recent-onset atrial fibrillation and flutter; the conversion rate is higher for atrial flutter than for atrial fibrillation. It is also safe in the conversion of chronic atrial fibrillation/flutter among patients receiving oral amiodarone therapy. Ibutilide pretreatment facilitates transthoracic defibrillation and decreases the energy requirement of electrical cardioversion by both monophasic and biphasic shocks. Pretreatment with ibutilide before electrical defibrillation has a conversion rate of 100% compared with 72% with no pretreatment. Ibutilide is also safe and efficient in the treatment of atrial fibrillation in patients who have had cardiac surgery, and in accessory pathway-mediated atrial fibrillation Where the conversion rate of ibutilide is as high as 95%. There is up to a 4% risk of torsade de pointes and a 4.9% risk of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. Hence, close monitoring in an intensive care unit setting is warranted during and at least for 4 hours after drug infusion. The anticoagulation strategy is the same as for any other mode of cardioversion.

Cardioversion of atrial fibrillation—recommendations for pharmacological cardioversion state that administration of flecainide, dofetilide, propafenone, or ibutilide is recommended for pharmacological cardioversion of AF (Level of Evidence: A). Administration of amiodarone is a reasonable option for pharmacological cardioversion of AF (Level of Evidence: A). A single oral bolus dose of propafenone or flecainide (pill-in-the-pocket) can be administered to terminate persistent AF outside the hospital once treatment has proved safe in hospital for selected patients without sinus or AV node dysfunction, bundle-branch block, QT-interval prolongation, the Brugada syndrome, or structural heart disease, and before antiarrhythmic medication is initiated, a beta blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist should be given to prevent rapid AV conduction in the event atrial flutter occurs (Level of Evidence: C). Administration of amiodarone can be beneficial on an outpatient basis in patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF when rapid restoration of sinus rhythm is not deemed necessary (Level of Evidence: C). Administration of quinidine or procainamide might be considered for pharmacological cardioversion of AF, but the usefulness of these agents is not well established (Level of Evidence: C). Digoxin and sotalol may be harmful when used for pharmacological cardioversion of AF and are not recommended (Level of Evidence: A). Quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, and dofetilide should not be started out of hospital for conversion of AF to sinus rhythm (Level of Evidence: B).

### Ibutilide fumarate [^115a4741]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Ibutilide fumarate injection is indicated for the rapid conversion of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter of recent onset to sinus rhythm. Patients with atrial arrhythmias of longer duration are less likely to respond to ibutilide fumarate. The effectiveness of ibutilide has not been determined in patients with arrhythmias of more than 90 days in duration.

 LIFE-THREATENING ARRHYTHMIAS—APPROPRIATE TREATMENT ENVIRONMENT 

 Ibutilide fumarate can cause potentially fatal arrhythmias, particularly sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, usually in association with QT prolongation (torsades de pointes), but sometimes without documented QT prolongation. In registration studies, these arrhythmias, which require cardioversion, occurred in 1.7% of treated patients during, or within a number of hours of, use of Ibutilide fumarate. These arrhythmias can be reversed if treated promptly (see WARNINGS, Proarrhythmia). It is essential that Ibutilide fumarate be administered in a setting of continuous ECG monitoring and by personnel trained in identification and treatment of acute ventricular arrhythmias, particularly polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Patients with atrial fibrillation of more than 2 to 3 days’ duration must be adequately anticoagulated, generally for at least 2 weeks.

CHOICE OF PATIENTS 

 Patients with chronic atrial fibrillation have a strong tendency to revert after conversion to sinus rhythm (see CLINICAL STUDIES) and treatments to maintain sinus rhythm carry risks. Patients to be treated with Ibutilide fumarate, therefore, should be carefully selected such that the expected benefits of maintaining sinus rhythm outweigh the immediate risks of Ibutilide fumarate, and the risks of maintenance therapy, and are likely to offer an advantage compared with alternative management.

Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

Pre-excited atrial fibrillation (AF) in the setting of accessory pathways—key acute care points: Synchronized cardioversion is highly effective in terminating pre-excited AF, and when AF with ventricular pre-excitation has an accessory pathway with a short refractory period, rapid pre-excited AV conduction can produce a fast, often irregular, broad-complex tachycardia that is often unstable and may lead to ventricular fibrillation, making early restoration of sinus rhythm important; small observational studies support the use of ibutilide or intravenous procainamide for the treatment of pre-excited AF in patients who are not hemodynamically compromised, and both medications can decrease ventricular rate by slowing conduction over the accessory pathway and may terminate AF.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^70c3efd0]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Pharmacological cardioversion for atrial fibrillation—recommendations and agents—is outlined as follows: For patients with AF, pharmacological cardioversion is reasonable as an alternative to electrical cardioversion for those who are hemodynamically stable or in situations when electrical cardioversion is preferred but cannot be performed (COR 2a, LOE C‑LD). For patients with AF, ibutilide is reasonable for pharmacological cardioversion for patients without depressed LV function (LVEF <40%) (COR 2a, LOE A). For patients with AF, intravenous amiodarone is reasonable for pharmacological cardioversion, although time to conversion is generally longer than with other agents (8-12 hours) (COR 2a, LOE A). For patients with recurrent AF occurring outside the hospital, the “pill‑in‑the‑pocket” approach with a single oral dose of flecainide† or propafenone,‡ with a concomitant atrioventricular nodal blocking agent,† is reasonable for pharmacological cardioversion if previously tested in a monitored setting (COR 2a, LOE A). For patients with AF, use of intravenous procainamide may be considered for pharmacological cardioversion when other intravenous agents are contraindicated or not preferred (COR 2b, LOE B‑R). Ibutilide works rapidly for pharmacological cardioversion of AF but is associated with QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes, particularly in patients with HFrEF.

ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 atrial fibrillation guideline—postoperative AF after cardiac surgery: Administration of AV nodal blocking agents is recommended to achieve rate control in patients who develop postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) (Level of Evidence: B). Preoperative administration of amiodarone reduces the incidence of AF in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and represents appropriate prophylactic therapy for patients at high risk for postoperative AF (Level of Evidence: A). It is reasonable to restore sinus rhythm by pharmacological cardioversion with ibutilide or direct-current cardioversion in patients who develop postoperative AF as advised for nonsurgical patients (Level of Evidence: B). It is reasonable to administer antiarrhythmic medications to maintain sinus rhythm in patients with recurrent or refractory postoperative AF, as recommended for other patients who develop AF (Level of Evidence: B). It is reasonable to administer antithrombotic medication in patients who develop postoperative AF, as recommended for nonsurgical patients (Level of Evidence: B). Prophylactic administration of sotalol may be considered for patients at risk of developing AF following cardiac surgery (Level of Evidence: B).

ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 atrial fibrillation—rate control (Class IIa): A combination of digoxin and either a beta blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist is reasonable to control heart rate at rest and during exercise in AF, with individualized choice and dose modulation to avoid bradycardia (Level of Evidence: B). It is reasonable to use ablation of the atrioventricular (AV) node or accessory pathway to control heart rate when pharmacological therapy is insufficient or causes side effects (Level of Evidence: B). Intravenous amiodarone can be useful to control heart rate when other measures are unsuccessful or contraindicated (Level of Evidence: C). When electrical cardioversion is not necessary in AF with an accessory pathway, intravenous procainamide or ibutilide is a reasonable alternative (Level of Evidence: C).

Atrial fibrillation—ibutilide and amiodarone efficacy, timing, and safety are summarized as follows. Randomized, double‑blind placebo‑controlled studies report ibutilide achieves AF conversion rates of about 30% versus 2% with placebo, with greater efficacy in atrial flutter (38%-63%), and most patients convert within 30 to 90 minutes. Ibutilide is associated with QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes; risk is higher with reduced LVEF, HFrEF is an independent risk factor, and ibutilide is best avoided when LVEF ≤40%; a magnesium infusion immediately before ibutilide may mitigate torsades and excessive QT prolongation. Intravenous amiodarone is effective for conversion; a meta‑analysis reported relative risks for sinus rhythm at 6 to 8 hours and at 24 hours of 1.23 (P=0.022) and 1.44 (P<0.001), respectively, and cardioversion with IV amiodarone requires 8 to 12 hours compared with a much shorter response time with ibutilide.

### Ibutilide: efficacy and safety in atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter in a general cardiology practice [^628d2df9]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Published experience with ibutilide (IB) in randomized clinical trials reveals that conversion to sinus rhythm (SR) occurs in 31% of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and in 63% of patients with atrial flutter.

Hypothesis

The study was undertaken to test the efficacy and safety of IB in patients with AF and with atrial flutter and to compare them with those reported in previous studies.

Methods

In a general cardiology practice, 54 consecutive patients with AF or atrial flutter, no contraindication to IB, and a normal QTc interval, were treated with intravenous IB (0.4-2.0 mg). Duration of arrhythmia, left atrial (LA) size, ejection fraction (EF), time to conversion, QTc interval, and adverse drug events were determined. Patients were observed for a minimum of 6 h. Successful cardioversion was defined as arrhythmia termination within 6 h.

Results

Twenty-four of 34 (70.6%) patients with AF and 15 of 20 (75%) patients with atrial flutter converted to SR. Conversion of AF to SR was more likely to occur if duration of AF was approximately 96 h compared with > 96 h (81 vs. 17%, respectively; p = 0.006). The mean time to arrhythmia termination was 68.8 min. Left atrial size, determined by echocardiogram, was 44 +/- 13 mm in 43 patients. Patients with LA size approximately 45 mm had a conversion rate of 55% in both AF and flutter, compared with a conversion rate of 72% in patients with LA size < 45 mm. Ejection fraction was not a predictor of drug success. The QTc intervals were significantly prolonged after IB administration, with a mean change of 47.1 ms for successfully treated patients. Sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia occurred in one patient within 1 min of IB infusion, requiring electrical cardioversion to SR. This patient's serum electrolytes and QTc interval were normal prior to IB infusion; however, the QTc increased by 160 ms (from 387 to 547 ms) during drug infusion. No systemic or pulmonary emboli occurred.

Conclusion

The efficacy of IB for conversion of AF to SR in this prospective observational study was considerably better than previously reported. Duration of AF remains an important predictor of conversion to SR. Complications are rare and without long-term adverse effects.

Pharmacological cardioversion efficacy and practical considerations—The text notes that “intravenous amiodarone requires a longer time for AF conversion than ibutilide.” It states that “Evidence from randomized studies support the efficacy of flecainide and propafenone for pharmacological cardioversion, and these drugs are reasonable for administration via the PITP approach for AF occurring outside of the hospital.” It further states, “Intravenous procainamide is more effective than placebo for pharmacological conversion of AF but is less effective than ibutilide.” Additionally, “Dofetilide, oral amiodarone, and oral sotalol have been shown to be effective for conversion of AF to sinus rhythm but require several days for efficacy and therefore are not practical choices for acute pharmacological cardioversion.” Finally, “Data do not support intravenous sotalol for pharmacological cardioversion of AF.”

### Ibutilide fumarate [^05266b84]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The recommended dose based on controlled trials (see CLINICAL STUDIES) is outlined in the Table below. Ibutilide infusion should be stopped as soon as the presenting arrhythmia is terminated or in the event of sustained or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, or marked prolongation of QT or QTc.

Recommended Dose of Ibutilide Fumarate Injection

In a trial comparing ibutilide and sotalol (see CLINICAL STUDIES), 2 mg ibutilide fumarate administered as a single infusion to patients weighing more than 60 kg was also effective in terminating atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.

In the post-cardiac surgery study (see CLINICAL STUDIES), one or two intravenous infusions of 0.5 mg (0.005 mg/kg per dose for patients weighing less than 60 kg) was effective in terminating atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.

Patients should be observed with continuous ECG monitoring for at least 4 hours following infusion or until QTc has returned to baseline. Longer monitoring is required if any arrhythmic activity is noted. Skilled personnel and proper equipment (see WARNINGS, Proarrhythmia), such as a cardioverter/defibrillator, and medication for treatment of sustained ventricular tachycardia, including polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, must be available during administration of ibutilide fumarate and subsequent monitoring of the patient.

### Ibutilide effectiveness and safety in the cardioversion of atrial fibrillation and flutter in the community emergency department [^9e802647]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Little is known about the use of ibutilide for cardioversion in atrial fibrillation and flutter outside of clinical trials. We seek to describe patient characteristics, ibutilide administration patterns, cardioversion rates, and adverse outcomes in the community emergency department (ED) setting. We also evaluate potential predictors of cardioversion success.

Methods

Using a retrospective cohort of adults who received ibutilide in 21 community EDs between January 2009 and June 2015, we gathered demographic and clinical variables from electronic health records and structured manual chart review. We calculated rates of cardioversion and frequency of ventricular tachycardia within 4 hours and estimated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) in a multivariate regression model for potential predictors of cardioversion.

Results

Among 361 patients, the median age was 61 years (interquartile range 53 to 71 years) and most had recent-onset atrial fibrillation and flutter (98.1%). Five percent of the cohort had a history of heart failure. The initial QTc interval was prolonged (>480 ms) in 29.4% of patients, and 3.1% were hypokalemic (<3.5 mEq/L). The mean ibutilide dose was 1.5 mg (SD 0.5 mg) and the rate of ibutilide-related cardioversion within 4 hours was 54.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 49.6% to 60.1%), 50.5% for atrial fibrillation and 75.0% for atrial flutter. Two patients experienced ventricular tachycardia (0.6%), both during their second ibutilide infusion. Age (in decades) (aOR 1.3; 95% CI 1.1 to 1.5), atrial flutter (versus atrial fibrillation) (aOR 2.7; 95% CI 1.4 to 5.1), and no history of atrial fibrillation and flutter (aOR 2.0; 95% CI 1.2 to 3.1) were associated with cardioversion.

Conclusion

The effectiveness and safety of ibutilide in this community ED setting were consistent with clinical trial results despite less stringent patient selection criteria.

Preexcited atrial fibrillation (AF)—acute and longer-term management: During an acute episode of preexcited AF with rapid ventricular response and hemodynamic instability, electrical cardioversion must be used to restore sinus rhythm. Pathway ablation has well-established efficacy and safety for those with preexcited AF with a high success rate (93%-95%), and electrophysiological study and accessory pathway (AP) ablation can be offered as first-line therapy. Pharmacological options that increase the refractory period of atrial tissue (ibutilide or procainamide) can slow AP conduction and terminate AF; in 1 study involving 22 patients, ibutilide terminated AF in 21 patients and prolonged refractoriness of the atrioventricular node, His-Purkinje system, and AP, and hemodynamically stable patients with preexcited AF can be pharmacologically managed with such agents. Atrioventricular nodal blocking agents can increase the risk of ventricular fibrillation (VF) by accelerating AP conduction; in a study of patients with WPW given verapamil during electrophysiological study, 2 patients deteriorated and required cardioversion, and because other safer options are readily available, atrioventricular nodal agents are best avoided in this setting.

### Flecainide versus ibutilide for immediate cardioversion of atrial fibrillation of recent onset [^110f56fa]. European Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Aims

This study compared the efficacy and safety of intravenous flecainide and ibutilide for immediate cardioversion of atrial fibrillation (AF).

Methods and Results

We conducted a prospective, randomised trial, including 207 patients with AF of recent onset (< or = 48 h). Flecainide was given over 20 min at a dose of 2 mg/kg body weight (maximum 200 mg), ibutilide was infused at a dose of 1 mg (or 0.01 mg/kg if less than 60 kg) over 10 min, followed by a 10 min observation period and an identical second dose if AF did not convert to sinus rhythm (SR). Treatment was considered successful if SR occurred within 90 min of starting medication. The conversion rates were 56.4% in patients given flecainide and 50.0% in patients given ibutilide (P=0.34). Multivariate analysis revealed that a lower age for women independently increased the probability of conversion. None of the other variables, including left atrial size, left ventricular systolic function, presence of left ventricular hypertrophy, plasma levels of potassium or magnesium at baseline, or concomitant use of digoxin, beta-blocker, diltiazem or verapamil were predictors of conversion. The frequency of adverse events was comparable in the two treatment groups.

Conclusions

There was no significant difference in the cardioversion efficacy or in the risk of adverse events between flecainide and ibutilide in patients with AF of recent onset. In patients without contraindications to both medications, the physician's choice has to be governed by other factors.

### Treatment of acute atrial (...) [^268b81c3]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Increased sympathetic activity and increased vagal tone decrease the atrial refractory period, as does thyrotoxicosis. These factors may therefore predispose patients to develop atrial fibrillation. Likewise, atrial fibrillation may be terminated by increasing the conduction velocity or increasing the refractory period of the atrial tissue. Antiarrhythmic medications may be of benefit by prolonging the refractory period of atrial tissue, thus preventing propagation of multiple reentry wavelets in the atria. 8 The results of these trials will determine the appropriate role of these two treatment strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation. Prevention of Embolic Events During Cardioversion Both electric and pharmacologic cardioversion carry a risk of embolic events, including stroke. However, the risk is very small in patients who have been in atrial fibrillation for less than 48 hours.

In a study of 357 patients who underwent cardioversion, only three patients had thromboembolic events. 9 Patients with persistent atrial fibrillation of unknown duration or more than 48 hours' duration should be treated with anticoagulants for three weeks before either pharmacologic or DC cardioversion is attempted. Anticoagulation should be continued for four weeks after cardioversion, since the atria require several weeks to recover normal contractile function in this situation. 10 The International Standardized Ratio should be maintained between 2. 0 and 3.
0. 10, 11. Table
3. It is important to note that all methods of pharmacologic cardioversion are associated with proarrhythmic risks. The incidence of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia may be as high as 2 percent, even with the use of oral agents. Therefore, we recommend that medical cardioversion be performed only in a monitored setting with an accessible defibrillator.

After successful cardioversion, it is necessary to observe patients. We recommend continued observation until the QT interval normalizes, or for four to five half-lives. If atrial fibrillation has been present for more than 48 hours or if the onset is unknown, an initial three- to six-week course of anticoagulation is recommended. Patients with chronic atrial fibrillation and at least one risk factor for thromboembolism should be considered for chronic anticoagulation.

### Ibutilide fumarate [^76916d6a]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients in registration trials were hemodynamically stable. Patients with specific cardiovascular conditions such as symptomatic heart failure, recent acute myocardial infarction, and angina were excluded. About two thirds had cardiovascular symptoms, and the majority of patients had left atrial enlargement, decreased left ventricular ejection fraction, a history of valvular disease, or previous history of atrial fibrillation or flutter. Electrical cardioversion was allowed 90 minutes after the infusion was complete. Patients could be given other antiarrhythmic drugs 4 hours postinfusion.

Results of the first two studies are shown in the tables below. Conversion of atrial flutter/ fibrillation usually (70% of those who converted) occurred within 30 minutes of the start of infusion and was dose related. The latest conversion seen was at 90 minutes after the start of the infusion. Most converted patients remained in normal sinus rhythm for 24 hours. Overall responses in these patients, defined as termination of arrhythmias for any length of time during or within 1 hour following completed infusion of randomized dose, were in the range of 43% to 48% at doses above 0.0125 mg/kg (vs 2% for placebo). Twenty-four hour responses were similar. For these atrial arrhythmias, ibutilide was more effective in patients with flutter than fibrillation (≥ 48% vs ≤ 40%).

*Percent of patients who converted within 70 minutes after the start of infusion.

†Percent of patients who remained in sinus rhythm 24 hours after dosing.

*Percent of patients who converted within 90 minutes after the start of infusion.

†Percent of patients who remained in sinus rhythm 24 hours after dosing.

The numbers of patients who remained in the converted rhythm at the end of 24 hours were slightly less than those patients who converted initially, but the difference between conversion rates for ibutilide compared to placebo was still statistically significant. In long-term follow-up, approximately 40 % of all patients remained recurrence free, usually with chronic prophylactic treatment, 400 to 500 days after acute treatment, regardless of the method of conversion.

Patients with more recent onset of arrhythmia had a higher rate of conversion. Response rates were 42% and 50% for patients with onset of atrial fibrillation/flutter for less than 30 days in the two efficacy studies compared to 16% and 31% in those with more chronic arrhythmias.

Ibutilide was equally effective in patients below and above 65 years of age and in men and women. Female patients constituted about 20% of patients in controlled studies.

### Ibutilide fumarate [^c226c0da]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

During registration trials, 1.7% of patients with atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation treated with Ibutilide fumarate developed sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia requiring cardioversion. In these clinical trials, many initial episodes of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia occurred after the infusion of ibutilide fumarate was stopped but generally not more than 40 minutes after the start of the first infusion. There were, however, instances of recurrent polymorphic VT that occurred about 3 hours after the initial infusion. In two cases, the VT degenerated into ventricular fibrillation, requiring immediate defibrillation. Other cases were managed with cardiac pacing and magnesium sulfate infusions. Nonsustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia occurred in 2.7% of patients and nonsustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardias occurred in 4.9% of the patients (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Proarrhythmic events must be anticipated. Skilled personnel and proper equipment, including cardiac monitoring equipment, intracardiac pacing facilities, a cardioverter/defibrillator, and medication for treatment of sustained ventricular tachycardia, including polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, must be available during and after administration of ibutilide fumarate. Before treatment with ibutilide fumarate, hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia should be corrected to reduce the potential for proarrhythmia. Patients should be observed with continuous ECG monitoring for at least 4 hours following infusion or until QTc has returned to baseline. Longer monitoring is required if any arrhythmic activity is noted. Management of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia includes discontinuation of ibutilide, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, especially potassium and magnesium, and overdrive cardiac pacing, electrical cardioversion, or defibrillation. Pharmacologic therapies include magnesium sulfate infusions. Treatment with antiarrhythmics should generally be avoided.

Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) preexcitation syndromes with atrial fibrillation—treatment recommendations are: Catheter ablation of the accessory pathway is recommended in symptomatic patients with AF who have WPW syndrome, particularly those with syncope due to rapid heart rate or those with a short bypass tract refractory period (Level of Evidence: B). Immediate direct-current cardioversion is recommended to prevent ventricular fibrillation in patients with a short anterograde bypass tract refractory period in whom AF occurs with a rapid ventricular response associated with hemodynamic instability (Level of Evidence: B). Intravenous procainamide or ibutilide is recommended to restore sinus rhythm in patients with WPW in whom AF occurs without hemodynamic instability in association with a wide QRS complex on the ECG (greater than or equal to 120-ms duration) or with a rapid preexcited ventricular response (Level of Evidence: C). Intravenous flecainide or direct-current cardioversion is reasonable when very rapid ventricular rates occur in patients with AF involving conduction over an accessory pathway (Level of Evidence: B). It may be reasonable to administer intravenous quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, ibutilide, or amiodarone to hemodynamically stable patients with AF involving conduction over an accessory pathway (Level of Evidence: B). Intravenous administration of digitalis glycosides or nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists is not recommended in patients with WPW syndrome who have preexcited ventricular activation during AF (Level of Evidence: B).

Atrial fibrillation—treatment algorithm for pharmacological conversion to sinus rhythm lists options by left ventricular (LV) function and setting. In patients with normal LV function, IV amiodarone or ibutilide (2a) are listed, and procainamide may be considered when amiodarone and ibutilide are not optimal; recommend avoidance of IV procainamide after amiodarone or ibutilide. For heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF; LVEF ≤40%), IV amiodarone (2a) is listed. For AF occurring outside the hospital in patients with normal LV function (“pill‑in‑the‑pocket”), flecainide or propafenone (2a) are listed. Use is “in the absence of preexcitation,” the first dose is administered in a monitored facility, and IV amiodarone requires several hours for efficacy whereas ibutilide is generally effective in 30 to 90 min but carries higher risk of QT prolongation and torsades de pointes.

Pregnancy—Direct-current cardioversion (DCCV) timing and antiarrhythmic drug considerations: Rapid atrioventricular conduction may have serious hemodynamic consequences for both mother and fetus. DCCV of AF in pregnant individuals is safe for both mother and fetus and should be performed within 48 hours of presentation to minimize risk of stroke. Appropriate sedation should be provided before DCCV, and fetal monitoring is generally used during and directly after DCCV. Antiarrhythmic drugs are used in pregnancy for both maternal and fetal conditions; their mechanisms and adverse effect profile must be tolerable to both mother and fetus, these medications should be avoided if possible during the first trimester, and initiation of the drug should be attempted at the lowest dose with involvement of an electrophysiologist or cardiologist skilled in the management of arrhythmias in pregnancy. Intravenous ibutilide has been used effectively in pregnant women with refractory AF, and in a pregnant patient with AF and manifest preexcitation, intravenous procainamide is also an option.

### Ibutilide to expedite ED therapy for recent-onset atrial fibrillation flutter [^311bfb12]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Ibutilide is a type III antiarrhythmic agent approved for the pharmacologic conversion of atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFl). Previous studies conducted outside the ED setting have demonstrated conversion rates of 60% to 80%. This response has been highest in patients with recent-onset AF-AFl. These observations and the 4-hour half-life of ibutilide suggest that it may be an excellent drug with which to treat AF-AFl in the ED. The purpose of the study was to examine the efficacy and safety of ibutilide in terminating AF-AFl in patients who present to the ED with symptoms of less than 3 days' duration, neither angina nor heart failure, and no comorbid conditions that require admission.

Methods

Among 36 enrolled patients, the admission electrocardiogram demonstrated AF in 26 and AFl in 10. Ibutilide 1 mg was administered intravenously for 10 minutes. If sinus rhythm was not present 10 minutes after the infusion concluded, a second infusion of 1 mg was given. Successful conversion was defined as restoration of sinus rhythm within 1 hour after the last dose of ibutilide.

Results

Sixteen (61.5%) of 26 patients with AF and 9 (90%) of 10 patients with AFl converted to sinus rhythm (overall conversion rate=69%). The mean time to arrhythmia termination was 19+/-9 minutes. The mean stay in the ED was 16.2 hours. No significant complications occurred.

Conclusion

We conclude that ibutilide is an excellent therapy option for restoring sinus rhythm in the ED. Its use may obviate the need for admission, avoid the risks and inconveniences of general anesthesia to perform electrical cardioversion, and reduce the ED length of stay in selected patients with recent-onset atrial arrhythmias.

Heart Rhythm (2014). Medium credibility.

Adult congenital heart disease (CHD)—acute pharmacologic cardioversion for IART or atrial fibrillation states that 1 to 2 mg of IV ibutilide administered over 10 minutes appears to be a reasonable option for pharmacologic cardioversion when used in a monitored setting where emergency defibrillation and resuscitation facilities are immediately available. In randomized non-CHD data, intravenous ibutilide (1 or 2 mg) versus DL-sotalol (1.5 mg/kg) showed both doses of ibutilide were more effective than sotalol for atrial flutter and only the 2-mg ibutilide dose was superior for atrial fibrillation, with bradycardia and hypotension more common with sotalol. Safety signals include that two of 211 patients (<1%) given 2 mg of ibutilide developed polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and the risk of torsades de pointes with ibutilide may be as high as 4.3%. In a CHD series, a single 2 mg/kg oral dose of sotalol successfully converted IART or ectopic atrial tachycardia in 84%, but two required temporary pacing for severe bradycardia and one had a fatal thromboembolic event 2 days after conversion. There are no efficacy and safety data regarding acute conversion of IART or atrial fibrillation with Class IA, IC, and other Class III drugs (amiodarone, dofetilide) in patients with CHD.

### Gender differences with ibutilide effectiveness and safety in cardioversion of atrial fibrillation [^c9e2b5a2]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Few studies have examined the use of ibutilide in noncardiac surgical populations. Our study considered the effectiveness and safety of ibutilide in cardioversion of atrial fibrillation (AF) in medical and surgical intensive care patients.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed for patients with a confirmed diagnosis of AF who were hemodynamically stable and received ibutilide after the initial diagnosis. Patients were administered 1 mg of ibutilide fumarate intravenous for 10 min with a second dose administered if AF persisted after 30 min. Patients were pretreated with intravenous magnesium sulfate if their blood magnesium level was <2 mg/dL.

Results

Fifty seven total female patients and 99 male patients received ibutilide. Females had an 88% conversion rate to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) compared to 68% in males (P = 0.008). A 70% successful return to NSR was observed in patients from all groups pretreated with magnesium sulfate (P = 0.045). One year after discharge, 74% of the patients stayed in the NSR.

Conclusions

Within our population, pretreatment with magnesium sulfate followed by ibutilide was associated with increased conversion to NSR. Additionally, we noted that females had a higher conversion rate to NSR compared to males, regardless of whether they were pretreated with magnesium sulfate.

### Ibutilide fumarate (corvert) [^6604ba57]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The recommended dose based on controlled trials (see CLINICAL STUDIES) is outlined in the Table below. Ibutilide infusion should be stopped as soon as the presenting arrhythmia is terminated or in the event of sustained or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, or marked prolongation of QT or QTc.

In a trial comparing ibutilide and sotalol (see CLINICAL STUDIES), 2 mg ibutilide fumarate administered as a single infusion to patients weighing more than 60 kg was also effective in terminating atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.

In the post-cardiac surgery study (see CLINICAL STUDIES), one or two intravenous infusions of 0.5 mg (0.005 mg/kg per dose for patients weighing less than 60 kg) was effective in terminating atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.

Patients should be observed with continuous ECG monitoring for at least 4 hours following infusion or until QTc has returned to baseline. Longer monitoring is required if any arrhythmic activity is noted. Skilled personnel and proper equipment (see WARNINGS, Proarrhythmia), such as a cardioverter/defibrillator, and medication for treatment of sustained ventricular tachycardia, including polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, must be available during administration of CORVERT and subsequent monitoring of the patient.

Dilution:

CORVERT Injection may be administered undiluted or diluted in 50 mL of diluent. CORVERT may be added to 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection before infusion. The contents of one 10 mL vial (0.1 mg/mL) may be added to a 50 mL infusion bag to form an admixture of approximately 0.017 mg/mL ibutilide fumarate. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.

### ACC / AHA / ESC 2006 guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines and the European Society of Cardiology committee for practice guidelines (writing committee to revise the 2001 guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation): developed in collaboration with the European Heart Rhythm Association and the Heart Rhythm Society [^29de32ee]. Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) management after cardiac surgery—rate/rhythm control and anticoagulation: Short-acting beta-blocker agents are particularly useful when hemodynamic instability is a concern; nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists can be alternatives, but digoxin is less effective when adrenergic tone is high, and intravenous amiodarone has been associated with improved hemodynamics. Given the self-limited course of postoperative AF, direct-current cardioversion is usually unnecessary except in the early hypothermic period; in highly symptomatic patients or when rate control is difficult, cardioversion may be performed with the same anticoagulation precautions as in nonsurgical cases. Pharmacological agents including amiodarone, procainamide, ibutilide, and sotalol may be effective to convert AF to sinus rhythm. In post-CABG patients, anticoagulation with warfarin or oral anticoagulation is appropriate when AF persists longer than 48 h, with drug choice (heparin and/or an oral anticoagulant) based on the individual clinical situation.

### Effect of flecainide and ibutilide alone and in combination to terminate and prevent recurrence of atrial fibrillation [^c7d74510]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The safety of anti-AF agents is critical in the clinical management of patients with AF. The safety and efficacy of both flecainide and ibutilide for acute cardioversion of episodes of AF have been extensively reported,, and the recommendation(s) for their use and respective contraindications have been reviewed in medical guidelines.For example, there is a known risk of flecainide-inducing ventricular proarrhythmia in patients with myocardial ischemia and structural heart disease.Yet, flecainide is generally safe in patients without significant structural heart disease.More recently, the safety of flecainide in patients with nonobstructive and stable coronary artery disease has been reported. – The use of ibutilide is associated with a substantial risk of acquired long-QT syndrome and associated life-threatening tachyarrhythmias.In our experiments, the TdP score increased from 0 in control to 4 in the presence of ibutilide and dropped to 1 following the addition of flecainide, denoting no or low risk for the development of TdP with the drug combination.The electrophysiological protection mechanism of the drug combination against TdP is most likely due to the action of flecainide to inhibit late I Na.Inhibition of late I Na under conditions of reduced repolarization reserve (ie, due to reduction of I Kr and augmentation of late I Na) acts to protect against the risk of excessive prolongation of QT and induction of TdP.

### Use of ibutilide in cardioversion of patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter treated with class IC agents [^4e81a413]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to assess the efficacy and safety of ibutilide cardioversion for those with atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter (AFL) receiving long-term treatmentwith class IC agents.

Background

Attenuation of ibutilide-induced QT prolongation has been observed in a small number of patients pretreated with class IC agents. The clinical significance of the interaction between ibutilide and class IC agents is unknown.

Methods

Seventy-one patients with AF (n = 48) or AFL (n = 23), receiving propafenone 300 to 900 mg/day (n = 46) or flecainide 100 to 300 mg/day (n = 25), presented for ibutilide (2.0 mg) cardioversion.

Results

The mean durations of arrhythmia episode and arrhythmia history were 25 +/- 48 days and 4.4 +/- 6.4 years, respectively. Sixty-five patients (91.5%) had normal left ventricular systolic function. Twenty-three of 48 patients (47.9%; 95% confidence interval, 33.3% to 62.8%) with AF and 17 of 23 patients (73.9%; 95% confidence interval, 51.6% to 89.8%) with AFL converted with mean conversion times of 25 +/- 14 min and 20 +/- 12 min, respectively. There was a small increase in corrected QT interval after ibutilide (from442 +/- 61 ms to 462 +/- 59 ms, p = 0.006). One patient developed non-sustained polymorphous ventricular tachycardia and responded to intravenous magnesium. Another developed sustained torsade de pointes and was treated effectively with direct-current shock and intravenous dopamine.

Conclusions

Our observations suggest that the use of ibutilide in patients receiving class IC agents is as successful in restoring sinus rhythm and has a similar incidence of adverse effects as the use of ibutilide alone.

### Dofetilide 0.125mg [^1c4db52b]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Therapy with dofetilide must be initiated (and, if necessary, re-initiated) in a setting that provides continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring and in the presence of personnel trained in the management of serious ventricular arrhythmias. Patients should continue to be monitored in this way for a minimum of three days. Additionally, patients should not be discharged within 12 hours of electrical or pharmacological conversion to normal sinus rhythm.
The dose of dofetilide must be individualized according to calculated creatinine clearance and QTc. (QT interval should be used if the heart rate is <60 beats per minute. There are no data on use of dofetilide when the heart rate is <50 beats per minute.) The usual recommended dose of dofetilide is 500 mcg BID, as modified by the dosing algorithm described below. For consideration of a lower dose, see Special Considerations below.
Serum potassium should be maintained within the normal range before dofetilide treatment is initiated and should be maintained within the normal range while the patient remains on dofetilide therapy. (See WARNINGS, Hypokalemia and Potassium-Depleting Diuretics). In clinical trials, potassium levels were generally maintained above 3.6 to 4 mEq/L.
Patients with atrial fibrillation should be anticoagulated according to usual medical practice prior to electrical or pharmacological cardioversion. Anticoagulant therapy may be continued after cardioversion according to usual medical practice for the treatment of people with AF. Hypokalemia should be corrected before initiation of dofetilide therapy (see WARNINGS, Ventricular Arrhythmia).
Patients to be discharged on dofetilide therapy from an inpatient setting as described above must have an adequate supply of dofetilide, at the patient’s individualized dose, to allow uninterrupted dosing until the patient can fill a dofetilide prescription.

### Hydroxychloroquine and CV events in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (...) [^f4378e82]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

eTable 11. Association Between Hydroxychloroquine Exposure and Cardiovascular Events in the Cohort of Patients With Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Controlled for Past Exposure to Hydroxychloroquine Data Sharing Statement Question What is the association of hydroxychloroquine with the overall risk of cardiovascular events in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Objective To evaluate the association between hydroxychloroquine and the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and other thromboembolic events in patients with SLE. Design, Setting, and Participants. Outcomes of interest were MI, stroke, and OTE, analyzed individually and as a composite outcome. Controls were matched to patients with CV events by age, sex, time since SLE onset and entry into the SNDS database, index date, prior antithrombotic and CV medication, chronic kidney disease, and hospitalization.

Multivariable conditional logistic regression was performed using hydroxychloroquine exposure as the main independent variable. There were 669 MI events, 916 stroke events, and 696 OTEs in the individual outcome studies. We aimed to evaluate the association between current hydroxychloroquine exposure and the overall relative risk of composite CV events and individual events in patients with SLE. Evaluating the persistence of this link after discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine was the secondary objective. The study outcomes were a composite of the following CV events and each CV event individually: MI, stroke, and OTEs. Events were identified using the ICD-10 codes reported in eTable 1 in Supplement 1.

For each outcome, the index date was the first record of a diagnostic code for the aforementioned events after entry into the SLE cohort. Our findings regarding the risk of OTE are consistent with those of other observational studies. 25-27 However, to our knowledge, this is the first study with usual-care data showing the benefits of hydroxychloroquine in improving arterial outcomes in patients with SLE. This finding is consistent with 2 studies8, 16 reporting a lower risk of MI in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with hydroxychloroquine.

### Antiarrhythmic drugs-clinical use and clinical decision making: a consensus document from the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) working group on cardiovascular pharmacology, endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS), Asia-Pacific Heart Rhythm Society (APHRS) and international society of cardiovascular pharmacotherapy (ISCP) [^7a87f8b0]. Europace (2018). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation and flutter—rhythm control emphasizes that severely haemodynamically compromised atrial fibrillation (AF) patients “should undergo emergency external electrical cardioversion,” whereas in haemodynamically stable AF patients elective cardioversion is performed to improve symptoms with the mode “based on the clinical setting.” Electrical cardioversion is described as having a “greater immediate success rate … and shorter hospitalization,” while pharmacological cardioversion may avoid general anaesthesia/deep sedation and “may prevent early AF recurrence.” Observational data report pharmacological cardioversion use “in >50% of patients” with paroxysmal (52.1%) or persistent AF (65.2%). Controlled trials show spontaneous restoration of sinus rhythm (SR) within 48 h in 76–83% of recent-onset AF cases (10–18% within 3 h; 55–66% within 24 h). Reported pharmacological cardioversion success rates “range from 10% to 80%, depending on AF duration.”

### Propafenone added to ibutilide increases conversion rates of persistent atrial fibrillation [^8fdebbaf]. Heart (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological conversion of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) with a combined propafenone plus ibutilide regimen.

Methods and Results

100 consecutive patients (66 men, mean (SD) age 65 (10) years) with persistent AF (mean (SD) duration 99 (92) days) admitted for elective pharmacological cardioversion were randomly assigned to treatment with either intravenous ibutilide (1 mg plus an additional 1 mg, if required; n = 51) or oral propafenone (600 mg) plus intravenous ibutilide at the same dose (n = 49). Success rates were 41.1% (21 of 51 patients) for ibutilide alone and 71.4% (35 of 49 patients) for propafenone plus ibutilide (p = 0.0044). However, cardioversion occurred earlier in the ibutilide alone group (55 (20) minutes) compared with the combination group (81 (32) minutes, p = 0.0019). A comparable increase in the QTc interval was observed in both groups but one case of sustained torsade de pointes, requiring electrical cardioversion, was observed in the propafenone plus ibutilide group. No other complications were noted during the hospitalisation period.

Conclusion

Concurrent administration of propafenone plus ibutilide for pharmacological cardioversion of persistent AF is safe and more effective than ibutilide alone.

### Ibutilide for the control of refractory ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation in patients with myocardial ischemia and hemodynamic instability [^14923c67]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) in patients with myocardial ischemia requiring hemodynamic support can be refractory to available antiarrhythmic agents and even to cardioversion and defibrillation. The purpose of this study was to report the effect of intravenous ibutilide in patients with a VT and/or VF storm in the presence of incomplete revascularization requiring hemodynamic support.

Methods and Results

Standard continuous telemetry and frequent 12-lead electrocardiograms were obtained to determine the effect of intravenous Ibutilide in these patients. We studied six consecutive patients (age 60±12 years; five males) with incomplete revascularization and mechanical support (extracorporeal membrane of oxygenation=2; left ventricular assist device=4) with VT/VF refractory to lidocaine and amiodarone. Intravenous ibutilide was given as a last resort for management of their ventricular arrhythmias. Intravenous ibutilide (1-2mg) allowed restoration of sinus rhythm in three patients with persistent VF that were refractory to multiple defibrillation shocks. When the 24-hour period before and after ibutilide administration was compared, this drug markedly reduced the number of required cardioversions/defibrillations in all patients from 20±9 to 0.7±0.8 shocks ( P=0.036).

Conclusions

In patients with myocardial ischemia requiring hemodynamic support, intravenous Ibutilide demonstrates a potent antiarrhythmic effect and can facilitate defibrillation in patients with refractory VF.

### Effect of flecainide and ibutilide alone and in combination to terminate and prevent recurrence of atrial fibrillation [^0e4c72e3]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical data on the combination of class IC and III antiarrhythmic agents for cardioversion and prevention of AF are limited. Hongo et alreported the efficacy and safety of IV ibutilide to acutely cardiovert AF and atrial flutter in 71 nonresponder patients receiving class IC agents long-term (oral flecainide or propafenone; daily for >3 months). Ibutilide was shown to cardiovert AF/atrial flutter in 48% of these patients (within 1 hour). This was within the range of AF/atrial flutter cardioversion reported with ibutilide alone. However, one patient developed sustained TdP and another nonsustained polymorphic VT following ibutilide administration and AF cardioversion.In these 2 patients, ibutilide caused a significant QT prolongation (to QT values ≥500 ms versus 437±62 ms on average in all patients).The incidence of adverse effects with the use of ibutilide on top of class IC agents was similar to that with ibutilide alone.It is noteworthy that the administration of class I agents was chronic (daily pills) and not simultaneous with IV ibutilide. Considering these factors and a much briefer T Max for IV ibutilide (minutes) versus oral flecainide/propafenone (hours), ibutilide plasma concentration is expected to be relatively high compared with that of the class I agent soon after ibutilide administration, resulting in an increased risk of ventricular proarrhythmia. It seems that for optimal efficacy and safety in the clinic, the application of ibutilide and flecainide combination should be designed to significantly overlap the concentration levels of the drugs in blood. In this study, ibutilide increased QTc by a mean of 20 ms,generally less compared with that resulting from the administration of ibutilide in the absence of sodium channel blockers in other investigations (in the range of 20–90 ms). This attenuation of ibutilide-induced QT c prolongation was attributed to the inhibition of late I Na by flecainide.In another study, IV administration of ibutilide rapidly cardioverted AF/atrial flutter (with a mean time of 39 min) in 66% of patients (67/104) in whom oral propafenone had not cardioverted the arrhythmias (propafenone was administrated at time 0 and 6 hours and ibutilide was administrated at 8 hours).Only 1 of these 104 patients developed a nonsustained episode of TdP.Reiffel et al.investigated the effect of IV ibutilide on QTc in patients in whom therapy with class IC agents (propafenone or flecainide; pills once a day) had been initiated (for purposes of sinus rhythm maintenance) and steady state had been achieved. In this study, pretreatment with class IC agents reduced the ibutilide-induced prolongation in QTc, and it was attributed to the inhibition of late I Na by the class IC agents.

### Comparison of direct current synchronized cardioversion to ibutilide-guided catheter ablation for long-term sinus rhythm maintenance after isolated pulmonary vein isolation of persistent atrial fibrillation [^1bc33f56]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Use of the antiarrhythmic ibutilide after isolated pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) might distinguish atrial remodeling severity and cases requiring further substrate modification, thereby improving efficacy of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment. Ninety-six consecutive patients with persistent AF were randomized after PVI to either direct current synchronized cardioversion (DCC group, n = 48) or 1 mg of intravenous ibutilide (ibutilide group, n = 48) followed by no further intervention if AF converted to sinus rhythm (SR) within 30 minutes (ibutilide conversion subgroup) or by complex fractionated atrial electrogram (CFAE) ablation until SR recovery or complete CFAE elimination (ibutilide nonconversion subgroup). With similarly distributed baseline characteristics and no serious postablation complications, the primary end point of 12-month SR maintenance rate after PVI was significantly higher for ibutilide versus the DCC group before (75% vs 56%; p = 0.042) or after (83% vs 60%; p = 0.011) reablation at physician's discretion for recurrence beyond 3 months after PVI. After ibutilide administration, 21 of 48 patients (44%) converted to SR at 17 ± 8 minutes (mean ± SD); those in the ibutilide nonconversion subgroup had larger atrial size (47 ± 4 vs 45 ± 4; p = 0.025) and CFAE area (29 ± 8 vs 12 ± 5; p = 0.001) and longer AF duration (27 ± 6 vs 21 ± 10; p = 0.026). Among ibutilide conversion and nonconversion subgroups and DCC group, procedure, ablation, and x-ray exposure times differed significantly, as did 12-month SR maintenance rate before (81% vs 70% vs 56%; p = 0.043) or after reablation (86% vs 81% vs 60%; p = 0.042). In conclusion, in persistent AF treatment, ibutilide-guided ablation after PVI yields higher 1-year SR maintenance rate than PVI only.

### Cardioversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation using intravenous antiarrhythmics: a European perspective [^1442e0ad]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Pharmacological cardioversion using intravenous antiarrhythmic agents is commonly indicated in symptomatic patients with recent-onset atrial fibrillation (AF). Except in hemodynamically unstable patients who require emergency direct current electrical cardioversion, for the majority of hemodynamically stable patients, pharmacological cardioversion represents a valid option and requires the clinician to be familiar with the properties and use of antiarrhythmic agents. The main characteristics of selected intravenous antiarrhythmic agents for conversion of recent-onset AF, the reported success rates, and possible adverse events are discussed. Among intravenous antiarrhythmics, flecainide, propafenone, amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide, and vernakalant are commonly used. Antazoline, an old antihistaminic agent with antiarrhythmic properties was also reported to give encouraging results in Poland. Intravenous flecainide and propafenone are the only Class I agents still recommended by recent guidelines. Intravenous new Class III agents as dofetilide and ibutilide have high and rapid efficacy in converting AF to sinus rhythm but require strict surveillance with electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring during and after intravenous administration because of the potential risk of QT prolongation and Torsades de Pointes, which can be prevented and properly managed. Vernakalant, a partial atrial selective was shown to have a high success rate and to be safe in real-life use.

### Chemical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation or flutter with ibutilide in patients receiving amiodarone therapy [^f7069da6]. Circulation (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Ibutilide is a class III drug that is used for the cardioversion of atrial arrhythmias, but it can cause torsade de pointes. Amiodarone also prolongs the QT interval but rarely causes torsade de pointes. There are no studies in which the concomitant use of the 2 agents was examined. The purpose of the present study was to assess the efficacy and safety of cardioversion with combination therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter.

Methods and Results

The study included 70 patients who were treated with long-term oral amiodarone and were referred for elective cardioversion of atrial fibrillation (57 of 70, 81%) or flutter (13 of 70, 19%). Patients were taking amiodarone (153+/-259 days, mean+/-SD) and were administered 2 mg intravenous ibutilide. Left ventricular ejection fraction was measured with echocardiography. The QT intervals were measured on 12-lead ECG. Fifty-five patients (79%) had structural heart disease. Patients were in arrhythmia for 196+/-508 days before cardioversion, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50+/-11%. In patients with atrial fibrillation, 22 (39%) of 57 and 7 (54%) of 13 patients with flutter converted within 30 minutes of infusion. Thirty-nine patients who did not convert after ibutilide were treated with electrical cardioversion, and 35 (90%) of 39 patients were successfully converted. The QT intervals were further prolonged after ibutilide for the group from 371+/-61 to 479+/-92 ms (P:<0.001). There was 1 episode of nonsustained torsade de pointes (1 of 70, 1.4%) after ibutilide.

Conclusions

The use of ibutilide converted 54% of patients with atrial flutter and 39% of patients with atrial fibrillation who were treated with long-term amiodarone. Despite QT-interval prolongation after ibutilide, only 1 episode of torsade de pointes occurred. Our observations suggest that combination therapy may be a useful cardioversion method for chronic atrial fibrillation or flutter.

### Pharmacological cardioversion with antazoline in atrial fibrillation: the results of the CANT study [^992c8081]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The clinical importance of atrial fibrillation (AF) is related not only to the increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, 1 but also to a steadily increasing number of patients with symptomatic episodes of AF requiring acute management in the emergency department (ED). 2 Timely successful cardioversion provides symptomatic relief and may prevent redundant hospitalizations. 3 Barring acute hemodynamic instability, the choice between pharmacological and electrical cardioversion relies on individual clinical decisions and the patient's preference. 4, 5 Because of the need for fasting state and anesthesia, the majority of patients initially undergo a pharmacological approach at rhythm conversion. 6 Existing antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) either confer a risk of proarrhythmia in patients with structural heart disease (propafenone, flecainide, ibutilide, dofetilide) 7 or have a delayed onset of action (amiodarone). 8 Recently adopted vernakalant is characterized by a more universal clinical profile, 9 yet its application is limited by its low availability in certain parts of the world 10 as well as clinical contraindications, including severe heart failure, recent acute coronary syndrome, and severe aortic valve stenosis. 4 Accordingly, the search for a rapid‐acting, well‐tolerated, and highly efficacious AAD continues.

Antazoline mesylate is a first‐generation antihistaminic compound that was originally intended for acute management of allergic reactions. 11 Accruing evidence shed light on its antiarrhythmic effect 12, 13, 14 related to an increased atrial refractory period and interatrial conduction time. 15 In the clinical scenario of short‐duration AF, antazoline was proven to be clinically safe and restore sinus rhythm (SR) more effectively than both placebo 16 and a propafenone‐based strategy. 17 Antazoline was also found useful in AF termination in the setting of the electrophysiology laboratory. 18, 19 Currently, antazoline is approved and widely applied in EDs throughout Poland in order to achieve acute rhythm control, despite not being covered in contemporary guidelines. 4, 5 To date, however, none of the reports systematically explored the success rate and safety of antazoline mesylate in comparison to other forms of pharmacological cardioversion, most importantly amiodarone.

Thus, the study aimed to evaluate the success rate and safety of cardioversion with intravenous antazoline mesylate (CANT [Cardioversion With Antazoline Mesylate] study) in patients with AF in comparison to amiodarone and/or propafenone in the real‐world setting of the ED.

### Dofetilide [^75972972]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Therapy with dofetilide capsules must be initiated (and, if necessary, re-initiated) in a setting that provides continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring and in the presence of personnel trained in the management of serious ventricular arrhythmias. Patients should continue to be monitored in this way for a minimum of three days. Additionally, patients should not be discharged within 12 hours of electrical or pharmacological conversion to normal sinus rhythm.
The dose of dofetilide capsules must be individualized according to calculated creatinine clearance and QTc. (QT interval should be used if the heart rate is <60 beats per minute. There are no data on use of dofetilide capsules when the heart rate is <50 beats per minute.) The usual recommended dose of dofetilide capsules is 500 mcg BID, as modified by the dosing algorithm described below. For consideration of a lower dose, see Special Considerations below.
Serum potassium should be maintained within the normal range before dofetilide capsules treatment is initiated and should be maintained within the normal range while the patient remains on dofetilide capsules therapy. (See WARNINGS, Hypokalemia and Potassium-Depleting Diuretics). In clinical trials, potassium levels were generally maintained above 3.6-4.0 mEq/L.
Patients with atrial fibrillation should be anticoagulated according to usual medical practice prior to electrical or pharmacological cardioversion. Anticoagulant therapy may be continued after cardioversion according to usual medical practice for the treatment of people with AF. Hypokalemia should be corrected before initiation of dofetilide capsules therapy (see WARNINGS, Ventricular Arrhythmia).
Patients to be discharged on dofetilide capsules therapy from an inpatient setting as described above must have an adequate supply of dofetilide capsules, at the patient's individualized dose, to allow uninterrupted dosing until the patient can fill a dofetilide capsules prescription.

### Ibutilide added to propafenone for the conversion of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter [^514a694d]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

We evaluated the safety and efficacy of ibutilide when added to propafenone in treating both paroxysmal and chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL).

Background

The effects of ibutilide in patients with paroxysmal or chronic AF/AFL who were pre-treated with propafenone have not been previously evaluated.

Methods

Oral propafenone was initially given in 202 patients with AF/AFL without left ventricular dysfunction. Intravenous ibutilide was administered in 104 patients in whom propafenone failed to convert the arrhythmia. Two different propafenone dosage regimens were used according to the duration of the presenting arrhythmia: patients with paroxysmal arrhythmia (n = 48) received 600 mg loading dose, and patients with chronic arrhythmia (n = 56) were receiving 150 mg three times a day as stable-dose pre-treatment.

Results

Ibutilide offered an overall conversion efficacy of 66.3% (69 of 104 patients), 70.8% for patients with paroxysmal AF/AFL and 62.5% for patients with chronic AF/AFL. Ibutilide significantly decreased the heart rate (HR) and further prolonged the QTc interval (p < 0.0001). The degree of HR reduction after ibutilide administration emerged as the sole predictor of successful arrhythmia termination (p < 0.001). After ibutilide, one patient (1%) developed two asymptomatic episodes of non-sustained torsade de pointes, and 10 patients (9.6%) manifested transient bradyarrhythmic events; however, all bradyarrhythmic effects were predictable, occurring mostly at the time of arrhythmia termination. None of 82 patients who decided to continue propafenone after successful cardioversion had immediate arrhythmia recurrence.

Conclusions

Our graded approach using propafenone and ibutilide appears to be a relatively safe and effective alternative for the treatment of paroxysmal and chronic AF/AFL to both rapidly restore sinus rhythm in nonresponders to monotherapy with propafenone and prevent immediate recurrences of the arrhythmia.

### Early and late postoperative tachyarrhythmias in children and young adults undergoing congenital heart disease surgery [^2f11db5f]. Pediatric Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiological Mechanisms

Pressure and volume overload may lead to significant geometrical changes in the atria. These modifications are then associated with electrical remodeling, such as increase of P-wave duration, sinus node recovery time lengthening and conduction delay across the crista terminalis. This process is combined with anatomic and electrical conduction barriers: the atrioventricular valve, right atrial free wall scars, and ASD patches were found to act as the central obstacle to reentry circuits. More than one circuit may coexist in patients after ASD closure. Those referred to as double-loop or figure-of-8 reentry circuits usually involve both the atriotomy scar and the tricuspid valve simultaneously. In those patients, ablation of the cavo-tricuspid isthmus leaves a single-loop periatriotomy tachycardia, which requires additional ablation.

IART is a macroreentrant tachycardia with an atrial rate typically in the range of 150 to 250 beats per min. Although the QRS is typically narrow, both preexisting intraventricular conduction disorders and aberrant atrioventricular conduction can result in a wide QRS (Fig. 2). The P-waves may differ from the sawtooth appearance of typical atrial flutter depending on the reentrant path location.

Fig. 2 
Intraatrial reentry tachycardia in a 19-year-old female after multiple surgery for aortic and mitral valves rheumatic disease. F wave is positive in the inferior leads, and negative in V1. Ventricular response is around 100/min with a 2:1 atrioventricular conduction

Management

Acute termination of IART or AF in patients with CHD may be achieved by synchronized electrical cardioversion, or pharmacological agents. Electrical cardioversion is recommended for hemodynamically unstable patients irrespective of arrhythmia duration or anticoagulation status. In patients with meso- or dextrocardia, patches or paddles should be adapted according to the location of the heart. In hemodynamically stable patients, the presence of intracardiac thrombus should be assessed by transesophageal echocardiography prior to cardioversion.

Ibutilide, a class 3 antiarrhythmic agent, had a successful cardioversion rate of 60 to 70% in children and adults. Given the risk of torsades de pointes, intravenous ibutilide should be administered over 10 min in a monitored setting. In Europe, amiodarone is used as first-line therapy for acute termination of IART or AF due to ibutilide unavailability.

### Ibutilide-induced alterations in electrocardiographic and spatial vectorcardiographic descriptors of ventricular repolarization [^d728a598]. Clinical Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Ibutilide is used for the pharmacologic cardioversion of atrial fibrillation (AF) or flutter (AFl). Ibutilide-induced QT interval prolongation has been demonstrated previously. However, its effects on vectorcardiographic (VCG) descriptors of ventricular repolarization (VR) have not been studied so far.

Hypothesis

To evaluate the effects of ibutilide on electrocardiographic (ECG) and VCG descriptors of VR, one or two repeated 10-min infusions of 1 mg of ibutilide were given in 50 consecutively recruited patients (36 women, mean age 69.4 +/- 9.3 years) with AF or AFl of recent onset.

Methods

The maximum and the minimum QT intervals, QT dispersion, the rate-corrected QT maximum, and the spatial VCG descriptors, spatial T amplitude, and spatial QRS-T angle were calculated before (baseline ECG) and 30 min after the start of ibutilide infusion (postinfusion ECG).

Results

After ibutilide infusion, 40 (80%) patients were cardioverted to sinus rhythm (Group 1), while in the remaining 10 (Group 2) AF or AFl persisted. In both study groups, temporal measures of VR were significantly increased from baseline to the postinfusion ECG. In Group 1, spatial T amplitude and spatial QRS-T angle did not differ between those two ECGs, while in Group 2 spatial T amplitude was significantly increased (p = 0.005) and spatial QRS-T angle was significantly decreased (p = 0.002) post infusion compared with baseline ECG.

Conclusions

While temporal measures of VR are significantly affected in all patients who receive ibutilide infusion for AF or AFl cardioversion, spatial VCG descriptors of VR are significantly altered only in those patients who fail to respond to the drug. A dose-related effect of ibutilide on the different aspects of VR should be suspected.

Unlabelled

Nifekalant for shock-resistant atrial fibrillation.

Introduction

In severely ill patients, the development of atrial fibrillation (AF) may provoke lethal hemodynamic instability requiring immediate electrical defibrillation, which often is unsuccessful. Using the novel potassium channel blocking agent nifekalant, we prospectively assessed the hypothesis that class III antiarrhythmic drugs facilitate electrical cardioversion and suppress the immediate recurrence of hemodynamically deleterious AF.

Methods and Results

Among 1896 adults admitted to the intensive care unit for cardiovascular diseases, hemodynamically destabilizing new-onset AF (systolic blood pressure<90 mm Hg) resistant to conventional electrical cardioversion occurred in 27 patients, and of these, 24 patients (70+/-12 years) were enrolled. Twenty-one patients had congestive heart failure and 11 patients had been mechanically ventilated. After three failed transthoracic cardioversions due to failure of conversion to SR (11 patients) or immediate reinitiation (13 patients), nifekalant (0.25+/-0.04 mg/kg) was administered intravenously, and electrical defibrillation was reattempted. In 18 patients (75%), sinus rhythm was restored and maintained after nifekalant infusion (6 patients) or subsequent transthoracic cardioversion (12 patients). Nifekalant administration significantly decreased the heart rate and increased systolic blood pressure during AF (P<0.001), and successful cardioversion rapidly further ameliorated these parameters (P<0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that atrial defibrillation failure (relative risk [RR] 19.34, P=0.05) and age of >75 years (RR 15.25, P=0.03) were independent predictors of in-hospital death.

Conclusion

Nifekalant renders electrical defibrillation and the prevention of the early recurrence of hemodynamically unstable AF more successful without deteriorating hemodynamics, and successful defibrillation is associated with a more favorable patient outcome. Pretreatment with other class III drugs, e.g., ibutilide or dofetilide, would also be efficacious in patients with failed urgent electrical cardioversion.

### Vernakalant versus procainamide for rapid cardioversion of patients with acute atrial fibrillation (RAFF4): randomised clinical trial [^8c08bf31]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Acute (recent onset) atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia requiring management in the emergency department.Our focus is on acute episodes of atrial fibrillation, which are usually less than 48 hours since onset and are symptomatic, requiring rapid treatment in the emergency department.We estimate that there are 500 000 acute atrial fibrillation visits annually to the emergency department in Canada and the United States combined.For acute atrial fibrillation, it is routine in Canadian emergency departments for physicians to attempt cardioversion to sinus rhythm, either with drugs or electrically. Compared with a rate control strategy, early rhythm control allows patients to be discharged home sooner, frees up valuable monitors, frees up nursing staff, and is associated with lower one year mortality rates.In the recent RAFF2 trial, we showed good outcomes for acute atrial fibrillation managed with rhythm control in the emergency department.An alternative strategy of patients returning the next day for electrical cardioversion by cardiology is not feasible in most hospitals and would see many patients miss the 12-24 hour window for safe cardioversion.

If rhythm control with drugs fails, then patients often undergo urgent electrical cardioversion, which is effective but may be associated with major delays in assembling the team and has been shown to have adverse events requiring treatment in 13.9% of patients.Cardioversion with drugs avoids some of the issues associated with electrical cardioversion; that is, the need for several skilled staff at the bedside, procedural sedation risks, and patient anxiety. Intravenous procainamide is a type IA antiarrhythmic agent and is recommended by the Canadian Cardiovascular Society and the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians.Procainamide is the most commonly used antiarrhythmic for acute atrial fibrillation in Canadian emergency departments.Intravenous vernakalant acts preferentially in the atria by blocking several ion channels and was approved in Europe in 2010. This drug has recently been approved in Canada, but is not yet widely used and is not available in the US.Intravenous ibutilide has a 2-3% risk of torsade de pointes, a potentially lethal arrhythmia,and is not currently recommended by the Canadian Cardiovascular Society and the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians. Intravenous amiodarone and oral sotalol are not recommended in the emergency department as they are no more effective than placebo in the first six to eight hours.Oral propafenone or flecainide, both class IC antiarrhythmic agents, have much slower onset of action than intravenous drugs and their intravenous formulations are not available in North America.

### Dofetilide (Tikosyn) [^5c85523c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Therapy with TIKOSYN must be initiated (and, if necessary, re-initiated) in a setting that provides continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring and in the presence of personnel trained in the management of serious ventricular arrhythmias. Patients should continue to be monitored in this way for a minimum of three days. Additionally, patients should not be discharged within 12 hours of electrical or pharmacological conversion to normal sinus rhythm.
The dose of TIKOSYN must be individualized according to calculated creatinine clearance and QTc. (QT interval should be used if the heart rate is <60 beats per minute. There are no data on use of TIKOSYN when the heart rate is <50 beats per minute.) The usual recommended dose of TIKOSYN is 500 mcg BID, as modified by the dosing algorithm described below. For consideration of a lower dose, see Special Considerations below.
Serum potassium should be maintained within the normal range before TIKOSYN treatment is initiated and should be maintained within the normal range while the patient remains on TIKOSYN therapy. (See WARNINGS, Hypokalemia and Potassium-Depleting Diuretics). In clinical trials, potassium levels were generally maintained above 3.6–4.0 mEq/L.
Patients with atrial fibrillation should be anticoagulated according to usual medical practice prior to electrical or pharmacological cardioversion. Anticoagulant therapy may be continued after cardioversion according to usual medical practice for the treatment of people with AF. Hypokalemia should be corrected before initiation of TIKOSYN therapy (see WARNINGS, Ventricular Arrhythmia).
Patients to be discharged on TIKOSYN therapy from an inpatient setting as described above must have an adequate supply of TIKOSYN, at the patient's individualized dose, to allow uninterrupted dosing until the patient can fill a TIKOSYN prescription.

### Guidance on short-term management of atrial fibrillation in coronavirus disease 2019 [^03e96ead]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Ibutilide is an I Kr blocker and late inward I Na agonist. Ibutilide is used for pharmacological cardioversion (Figure 1) of AF or atrial flutter. QT interval must be monitored for 2 to 6 hours after the infusion. 58 Ibutilide is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6.

Dofetilide and ibutilide use may be limited in COVID‐19 patients already receiving hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, macrolides, or lopinavir/ritonavir because of their intrinsic dose‐dependent QT prolongation. However, the use of ibutilide may be a good option for conversion of acute symptomatic AF (Figure 1).

Sotalol is an I Kr blocker (dose dependent) with moderate β‐blockade effect. 38 Sotalol is renally excreted (Figure 2). 38 If sotalol is used in the presence of lopinavir/ritonavir, which is nephrotoxic, QT interval should be followed closely. Sotalol may be used with lopinavir/ritonavir, tocilizumab, or sarilumab, given lack of interaction on CYP3A4 or CYP2D6. However, there are dose‐dependent QT prolongation drug interactions with hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and macrolides, so monitoring should be implemented. Class III AADs are generally contraindicated in patients who are treated with fingolimod because of QT prolongation and risk of torsade de pointes. 36

Class IV

Nonhydropyridine calcium channel blockers are used as first‐line rate‐control agents in AF. 17 Diltiazem and verapamil block L‐type calcium channels and are contraindicated in patients with decompensated CHF or significantly reduced ejection fraction because of negative inotropic effect 17, 49 (Figure 1).

Diltiazem is metabolized by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. The use of diltiazem (P‐glycoprotein inhibitor) with azithromycin (P‐glycoprotein substrate) has been reported to prolong QT interval, leading to torsade de pointes. 59 Lopinavir/ritonavir may cause prolonged PR and second‐ or third‐degree heart block when used with calcium channel blockers. 24 Lopinavir/ritonavir can increase calcium channel blocker plasma concentration through CYP3A4 inhibition and should be closely monitored 47, 60 (Figure 1).

### Pharmacological cardioversion with antazoline in atrial fibrillation: the results of the CANT study [^536f8435]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Outcomes and Safety End Points

The primary end point was successful restoration of SR during a stay in the ED or after urgent hospital admission, which was confirmed by means of a 12‐lead ECG and persisted until discharge. In the event of lack of rhythm conversion following drug administration, patients were either observed for at least 12 hours before discharge from the ED or admitted to the hospital with the intention of further pharmacological cardioversion and/or electrical cardioversion. This concerned all the assessed drugs so as to exclude possible late arrhythmia reversal. The moment of hospital admission was not consistent with unsuccessful pharmacological cardioversion, as some patients regained SR in the cardiology department. Patients in whom SR was eventually restored by means of electrical cardioversion were regarded as patients with unsuccessful pharmacological cardioversion.

The safety end point was defined as an acute adverse event in the direct aftermath of cardioversion in the form of bradycardia <45 bpm, hypotension (decrease of systolic blood pressure of >40 mm Hg), syncope, or death.

General

Antiarrhythmics:

Class Ia antiarrhythmic drugs (Vaughan Williams Classification), such as disopyramide, quinidine, and procainamide, and other class III drugs, such as amiodarone and sotalol, should not be given concomitantly with CORVERT Injection or within 4 hours postinfusion because of their potential to prolong refractoriness. In the clinical trials, class I or other class III antiarrhythmic agents were withheld for at least 5 half-lives prior to ibutilide infusion and for 4 hours after dosing, but thereafter were allowed at the physician's discretion.

Other drugs that prolong the QT interval:

The potential for proarrhythmia may increase with the administration of CORVERT Injection to patients who are being treated with drugs that prolong the QT interval, such as phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, tetracyclic antidepressants, and certain antihistamine drugs (H1receptor antagonists).

Heart block:

Of the nine (1.5%) ibutilide-treated patients with reports of reversible heart block, five had first degree, three had second degree, and one had complete heart block.

Drug Interactions:

No specific pharmacokinetic or other formal drug interaction studies were conducted.

Digoxin:

Supraventricular arrhythmias may mask the cardiotoxicity associated with excessive digoxin levels. Therefore, it is advisable to be particularly cautious in patients whose plasma digoxin levels are above or suspected to be above the usual therapeutic range. Coadministration of digoxin did not have effects on either the safety or efficacy of ibutilide in the clinical trials.

Calcium channel blocking agents:

Coadministration of calcium channel blockers did not have any effect on either the safety or efficacy of ibutilide in the clinical trials.

Beta-adrenergic blocking agents:

Coadministration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents did not have any effect on either the safety or efficacy of ibutilide in the clinical trials.

### Vernakalant versus procainamide for rapid cardioversion of patients with acute atrial fibrillation (RAFF4): randomised clinical trial [^3464a314]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Previous studies

We are aware of no previous studies directly comparing intravenous procainamide with intravenous vernakalant. In the RAFF2 trial, we showed that a strategy of rhythm control for acute atrial fibrillation with intravenous procainamide avoided the need for electrical cardioversion in about half of patients.The results of our current study suggest that use of vernakalant could prevent the need for resource intensive procedural sedation required for electrical cardioversion in two thirds of patients with acute atrial fibrillation. Our reported conversion rates and times for procainamide and vernakalant were similar to those found in previous studies. An observational study of 316 patients receiving procainamide found a conversion rate of 52.2% and a median time to conversion of 55 minutes, and the RAFF2 trial reported a conversion rate of 52.0%.For vernakalant, SPECTRUM is a postmarketing surveillance registry in Europe that reported on 1289 patients with acute atrial fibrillation treated in emergency departments.Overall, successful conversion occurred in 70.2%, with a median conversion time of 12 minutes.

Intravenous drugs available elsewhere (flecainide, propafenone) are not available in Canada, leaving three possible choices: ibutilide, procainamide, and vernakalant.Intravenous ibutilide has a 2-3% risk of torsade de pointes, a potentially lethal arrhythmia,and is not currently recommended by the Canadian Cardiovascular Society and the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians. Intravenous flecainide and propafenone are available in Europe and are listed as alternatives to vernakalant by the European Society of Cardiology.

### Ibutilide fumarate [^3eb617f2]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Use in Patients with Hepatic or Renal Dysfunction

The safety, effectiveness, and pharmacokinetics of ibutilide fumarate have not been established in patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction. However, it is unlikely that dosing adjustments would be necessary in patients with compromised renal or hepatic function based on the following considerations: (1) Ibutilide fumarate is indicated for rapid intravenous therapy (duration ≤30 minutes) and is dosed to a known, well-defined pharmacologic action (termination of arrhythmia) or to a maximum of two 10-minute infusions; (2) less than 10% of the dose of ibutilide fumarate is excreted unchanged in the urine; and (3) drug distribution appears to be one of the primary mechanisms responsible for termination of the pharmacologic effect. Nonetheless, patients with abnormal liver function should be monitored by telemetry for more than the 4-hour period generally recommended.

In 285 patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter who were treated with ibutilide fumarate, the clearance of ibutilide was independent of renal function, as assessed by creatinine clearance (range 21 to 140 mL/min).

Atrial fibrillation—safety considerations and monitoring for ibutilide, procainamide, and sotalol are described as follows: Most reported cases of ibutilide-associated nonsustained VT and torsades de pointes have occurred within 30 minutes after the last dose, with torsades de pointes rarely as late as 2.5 hours after an ibutilide infusion; QTc intervals generally return to baseline within 2 to 3 hours after a dose. The risk of drug-induced torsades de pointes is higher in patients with hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia, with hypokalemia present in 17% to 70% of patients who developed drug-induced torsades de pointes; hypomagnesemia has been reported to be a contributing factor, and maintaining normal potassium and magnesium before ibutilide with magnesium supplementation may mitigate risk. Intravenous procainamide is associated with hypotension in 5% to 12% of patients when used for management of AF and is also associated with widening of the QRS complex and prolongation of the QT interval, potentially provoking monomorphic VT and torsades de pointes. Sotalol is associated with torsades de pointes, with an incidence ranging from 0.4% to 2.3%; initiation or dose escalation is often managed with at least 3 days of inpatient capability for CrCl calculations, continuous electrocardiographic monitoring, and cardiac resuscitation, and after discharge on a stable dose, a 12-lead ECG and serum magnesium, potassium, and creatinine are recommended every 3 to 6 months, more frequently if taking other QT interval-prolonging drugs or with changing kidney function.

### Intraprocedural use of ibutilide to organize and guide ablation of complex fractionated atrial electrograms: preliminary assessment of a modified step-wise approach to ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation [^9490bb5d]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

While able to achieve clinical success, the current step-wise approach to persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation requires considerable "substrate" ablation and frequently mandates multiple procedures to address consequent atrial tachycardias (ATs). An alternative strategy minimizing the amount of ablation while maintaining clinical success would be desirable. We hypothesize that intraprocedural administration of a low-dose antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) during AF will organize areas of passive activation and not affect areas critical to AF maintenance, thereby potentially minimizing the ablation lesion set.

Methods and Results

Eleven patients (age = 55 +/- 6 years; LA = 48 +/- 15 mm; median AF duration = 3 years) with persistent AF undergoing catheter ablation were enrolled in this exploratory prospective observational study. After pulmonary vein (PV) isolation, a mean cycle length (mCL) map was created and areas with mCL <120 ms were considered to represent complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAE). Ibutilide (0.25-1.0 mg) was then administered and a second mCL map created. Ablation lesions were placed at CAFE sites identified after ibutilide administration. Activation and/or entrainment mapping was employed to address ATs. The endpoint of ablation was achieving sinus rhythm. The average LA mCL increased (146 vs 165 ms, P = 0.01) and the LA CFAE surface area decreased after ibutilide administration. Additional ablation organized AF to either sinus rhythm or AT in 10/11 (91%) patients. After a median follow up of 455 days, 8 of 11 (72%) patients were free from AF. Three patients underwent a repeat ablation procedure (average 1.27 ablations/patient).

Conclusions

Ibutilide administration may organize atrial activity and facilitate AF termination during ablation while minimizing the ablation lesion set.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Pharmacological versus electrical cardioversion—effectiveness, timing, and anticoagulation considerations: Cardioversion may be achieved by means of drugs or electrical shocks, and although drug use has increased, disadvantages include the risk of drug-induced torsades de pointes; pharmacological cardioversion is less effective than direct-current cardioversion when biphasic shocks are used, while electrical cardioversion requires conscious sedation or anesthesia. There is no evidence that the risk of thromboembolism or stroke differs between pharmacological and electrical methods, and recommendations for anticoagulation are therefore the same for both methods. Pharmacological cardioversion seems most effective when initiated within 7 d after the onset of an episode of atrial fibrillation; a large proportion of patients with recent-onset atrial fibrillation experience spontaneous cardioversion within 24 to 48 h, whereas spontaneous conversion is less frequent with longer than 7-d duration and efficacy of drug cardioversion is markedly reduced. Pharmacological therapy may accelerate restoration of sinus rhythm but the advantage over placebo is modest after 24 to 48 h and is much less effective in persistent atrial fibrillation, and some drugs have a delayed onset with conversion not occurring for several days after initiation. Antiarrhythmic drugs can interact with vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants when added or withdrawn, and when anticoagulation is initiated for elective cardioversion, adding an antiarrhythmic may perturb the intensity of anticoagulation beyond the intended therapeutic range, raising the risk of bleeding or thromboembolic complications.

Atrial fibrillation—electrical and pharmacological cardioversion overview is described as follows: Cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm is a mode of acute rhythm control and can be achieved electrically or pharmacologically. Electrical cardioversion, given rapidity and efficacy, is the treatment of choice for patients with hemodynamic instability attributable to AF, and cardioversion should also be considered for hemodynamically stable AF intolerant of atrioventricular dyssynchrony, loss of atrial kick, or unable to achieve adequate rate control. In stable AF, both electrical and pharmacological cardioversion are acceptable, safe, and efficacious; electrical cardioversion is more effective than pharmacological cardioversion alone but involves the trade-off of anesthesia or sedation. Thromboembolic risks and considerations for anticoagulation apply to both pharmacological and electrical cardioversion.

### Ibutilide fumarate [^445fb420]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Proarrhythmia 

Like other antiarrhythmic agents, ibutilide fumarate injection can induce or worsen ventricular arrhythmias in some patients. This may have potentially fatal consequences. Torsades de pointes, a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that develops in the setting of a prolonged QT interval, may occur because of the effect ibutilide fumarate has on cardiac repolarization, but ibutilide fumarate can also cause polymorphic VT in the absence of excessive prolongation of the QT interval. In general, with drugs that prolong the QT interval, the risk of torsades de pointes is thought to increase progressively as the QT interval is prolonged and may be worsened with bradycardia, a varying heart rate, and hypokalemia. In clinical trials conducted in patients with atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, those with QTc intervals greater than 440 msec were not usually allowed to participate, and serum potassium had to be above 4 mEq/L. Although change in QTc was dose dependent for ibutilide, there was no clear relationship between risk of serious proarrhythmia and dose in clinical studies, possibly due to the small number of events. In clinical trials of intravenous ibutilide, patients with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) or low left ventricular ejection fraction appeared to have a higher incidence of sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), than those without such underlying conditions; for sustained polymorphic VT the rate was 5.4% in patients with a history of CHF and 0.8% without it. There was also a suggestion that women had a higher risk of proarrhythmia, but the sex difference was not observed in all studies and was most prominent for nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. The incidence of sustained ventricular arrhythmias was similar in male (1.8%) and female (1.5%) patients, possibly due to the small number of events. Ibutilide fumarate is not recommended in patients who have previously demonstrated polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (eg, torsades de pointes).

### Effect of flecainide and ibutilide alone and in combination to terminate and prevent recurrence of atrial fibrillation [^75d4a043]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2024). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND:

There is a need for improved approaches to rhythm control therapy of atrial fibrillation (AF).

METHODS:

The effectiveness of flecainide (1.5 µmol/L) and ibutilide (20 nmol/L), alone and in combination, to cardiovert and prevent AF recurrence was studied in canine-isolated coronary–perfused right atrioventricular preparations. We also examined the safety of the combination of flecainide (1.5 µmol/L) and ibutilide (50 nmol/L) using canine left ventricular wedge preparations.

RESULTS:

Sustained AF (>1 hour) was inducible in 100%, 60%, 20%, and 0% of atria in the presence of acetylcholine alone, acetylcholine+ibutilide, acetylcholine+flecainide, and acetylcholine+ibutilide+flecainide, respectively. When used alone, flecainide and ibutilide cardioverted sustained AF in 40% and 20% of atria, respectively, but in 100% of atria when used in combination. Ibutilide prolonged atrial and ventricular effective refractory period by 15% and 8%, respectively, at a cycle length of 500 ms (P <0.05 for both). Flecainide increased the effective refractory period in atria by 27% (P <0.01) but by only 2% in the ventricles. The combination of the 2 drugs lengthened the effective refractory period by 42% in atria (P <0.01) but by only 7% (P <0.05) in the ventricles. In left ventricular wedges, ibutilide prolonged QT and T peak -T end intervals by 25 and 55%, respectively (P <0.05 for both; cycle length, 2000 ms). The addition of flecainide (1.5 µmol/L) partially reversed these effects (P <0.05 for both parameters versus ibutilide alone). Torsades de Pointes score was relatively high with ibutilide alone and low with the drug combination.

CONCLUSIONS:

In our experimental model, a combination of flecainide and ibutilide significantly improves cardioversion and prevents the recurrence of AF compared with monotherapies with little to no risk for the development of long-QT–mediated ventricular proarrhythmia.

Antiarrhythmic drug pharmacodynamics—key interaction risks and monitoring are described: for Class I antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD), “Combinations of these drugs reduce cardiac contractility and increase the risk of bradycardia, intracardiac conduction disturbances, and proarrhythmia,” and “Co-administration of Class I AAD with beta-blockers, diltiazem, verapamil, or digoxin increases the risk of bradycardia, AV block and hypotension”; “Lidocaine is less effective in the presence of hypokalaemia; therefore, it should be corrected,” and “Propafenone increases the effects of cyclosporin, desipramine, and theophylline”; with beta‑blockers, “Their combination with Class I AAD, digoxin or amiodarone increases the risk of bradycardia, AV block and myocardial depression … [and] The combination with diltiazem and verapamil should be avoided because it increases the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, AV block, and heart failure”; for amiodarone, “Co-administration with digoxin, beta-blockers, verapamil, or diltiazem increases the risk of bradycardia and AV block and hypotension; thus, ECG and blood pressure should be monitored … Severe bradycardia has been reported when amiodarone is coadministered with hepatitis C antiviral drugs (daclatasvir, ledipasvir, and sofosbuvir),” while “Combination of amiodarone with fentanyl may cause hypotension, bradycardia, and decreases cardiac output” and “Higher IV doses of dopamine and dobutamine are needed in patients on amiodarone”; torsade risk is highlighted as “Class I and III AAD (particularly dofetilide, ibutilide, and sotalol) prolong the QT interval and should be used with caution (or avoided) … [and] Hypokalaemia increases the risk of torsades de pointes and potentiates digoxin-induced arrhythmias; thus, it should be corrected”; for nondihydropyridine calcium‑channel blockers, “Co-administration of diltiazem or verapamil with disopyramide or inhaled anaesthetics decreases cardiac contractility and increases the risk of bradycardia, AV block, and hypotension; therefore, it should be avoided”; for adenosine, “Its coadministration with beta-blockers, digoxin, diltiazem, or verapamil increases the risk of bradycardia and AV block … Dipyridamole inhibits the uptake of adenosine potentiating its effects; theophylline blocks adenosine receptors and decreases the effects of adenosine.”

### Corticosteroids and the risk of atrial fibrillation (...) [^ffcad6ee]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

To test the hypothesis that high-dose corticosteroid exposure increases the risk of new-onset atrial fibrillation, we performed a nested case-control study within the Rotterdam Study, a population-based cohort study among 7983 older adults. Cases were defined as persons with incident atrial fibrillation between July 1, 1991, and January 1, 2000. Since most of the high-dose corticosteroid users had other known risk factors for AF, we performed 2 extra analyses. In an age- and sex-adjusted analysis including the sum score as a continuous variable, the measures of association became stronger. For the high-dose group, the OR became 6. 43, while it was
6. 07 in the multivariate analysis. This population-based study shows that current use of high-dose corticosteroids is associated with an increased risk of new-onset AF. This association was found in patients with and without asthma/COPD.

First, it has been postulated that high-dose corticosteroids mediate potassium efflux via a direct effect on the cell membrane, which may induce arrhythmogenesis. 15 Second, high doses of glucocorticosteroids can have mineralocorticosteroid effects, such as retention of sodium and fluid, which may cause hypertension, left atrial enlargement, and congestive heart failure—all known risk factors for AF. 28 Other proposed mechanisms are development of late potentials, profound peripheral vasodilatation, and anaphylactic reactions. 29, 30 However, there is yet no conclusive evidence for any of these mechanisms. In our study population, there were few cases with AF without any underlying cardiovascular risk factor. Therefore, we think that high-dose corticosteroid therapy may act as a trigger rather than as a single cause for AF, which would be in line with the earlier described trigger-substrate relation in drug-induced AF.
9.

In conclusion, our findings suggest that patients receiving high-dose corticosteroid therapy are at increased risk of developing AF. Therefore, careful monitoring of these patients by clinical examination and by performing an ECG before and after high-dose therapy could increase the chance to diagnose and treat this serious arrhythmia as early as possible. Because persons who develop AF are at increased risk of serious cardiovascular complications such as heart failure and ischemic stroke and have a chance to develop chronic AF, early detection of AF is essential.

### Mechanisms of chemical atrial defibrillation by flecainide and ibutilide [^a37e3b56]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2024). Medium credibility.

We next carried out safety pharmacology computational screening using the ORd human computational ventricular myocytes to determine the effect of flecainide and ibutilide alone or in combination to promote proarrhythmia, by assessing or measuring key proarrhythmia parameters. In Figure 7 we show that the optimized ORd model accurately reproduces the clinically reported effect of flecainide when compared with simulated QT (Figure 7A) and rate-corrected QTc (Figure 7B) intervals compared with clinical data.Simulations were conducted in a 1-dimensional tissue of 4 cm simulation to approximate the size of the human heart.

In Figure 8, the predicted effect of ibutilide and ibutilide in combination with flecainide 1.5 μmol/L is shown on the imputed QT interval in simulated optimized ORd model tissue (Table 5) as well as the rate corrected QT (QTc) withforandfor(Table 2).The tissue simulations very closely track with the experimentally reported measurements.The model assesses the impact of flecainide and ibutilide, both individually and in combination, on changes in QRS duration and cardiac conduction. This comprehensive analysis highlights their effects on various cardiac intervals and parameters. The model demonstrates that higher-dose flecainide 1.5 μmol/L increases QRS duration and slows conduction velocity (CV) by approximately 9.5 cm/s. Additionally, when combined with ibutilide (0.02 μmol/L), QRS interval further increases, and CV is reduced by about 10.8 cm/s.

Electrical cardioversion for atrial fibrillation (AF)—key recommendations are as follows: In patients with hemodynamic instability attributable to AF, immediate electrical cardioversion should be performed to restore sinus rhythm. In patients with AF who are hemodynamically stable, electrical cardioversion can be performed as an initial rhythm-control strategy or after unsuccessful pharmacological cardioversion. In patients with AF undergoing electrical cardioversion, energy delivery should be synchronized to the QRS to reduce the risk of inducing ventricular fibrillation (VF). For elective electrical cardioversion in AF, use of biphasic energy of at least 200 J as initial energy can be beneficial to improve success of the initial electrical shock. When AF duration is longer or the initial shock is unsuccessful during elective cardioversion, optimization of electrode vector, use of higher energy, and pretreatment with antiarrhythmic drugs can facilitate success. In patients with obesity and AF, manual pressure augmentation and/or further escalation of electrical energy may be beneficial to improve success of electrical cardioversion.

Drug-induced cardioversion of atrial fibrillation (AF) and its mechanism. A, A typical example of AF cardioversion by the flecainide and ibutilide combination. AF cardioversion was preceded by the conversion of AF to atrial tachycardia. B, Apparent prime mechanism of AF termination with flecainide and ibutilide combination: rate-dependent depression of excitability. The recordings were simultaneously obtained following the termination of AF (in the presence of acetylcholine [ACh]+flecainide+ibutilide). The data were obtained from right atrial preparations with a rim of the right ventricle. AP indicates action potential.

Experimental Series III (LV Wedge Preparations)

Ibutilide (50 nmol/L) caused significant prolongation of APD 90 and QT intervals in the LV wedge preparations (Figures 7 and 8). T peak -T end intervals, reflecting transmural dispersion of repolarization, were also dramatically prolonged by ibutilide (Figures 7 and 8). The addition of flecainide (1.5 µmol/L) caused an abbreviation of all of these parameters (Figures 7 and 8). The TdP score was 0 in the absence of the drug; the score increased to 4 in the presence of ibutilide and dropped to 1 following the addition of flecainide to the perfusate containing ibutilide.

### Ibutilide for treatment of atrial fibrillation in the emergency department [^75f49193]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of ibutilide, a class III antiarrhythmic drug, for acute treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) in the emergency department (ED) setting. A retrospective analysis was done reviewing all patients with AF who received ibutilide in the ED in a university hospital setting. A total of 22 patients received ibutilide. Another 24 patients who received rate control drugs only served as a control group. Of the 22 patients who received ibutilide, 14 (64%) converted to sinus rhythm. The mean (SD) rate of AF was 137 (24) bpm and the mean QTc interval immediately after conversion to sinus rhythm was 420 (28) ms. There were no complications. In the rate control group 7 patients (29%) converted to sinus rhythm (p<0.05, compared with ibutilide). The mean rate of AF was 126 (26) bpm (p = ns, compared with ibutilide) and the mean QTc interval in those who converted was 377 (28) ms (p<0.05, compared with ibutilide). One patient developed severe bradycardia. Ibutilide is effective for conversion of recent onset AF in patients presenting to the ED and there is a low rate of complications from ibutilide in this setting.

### Effect of flecainide and ibutilide alone and in combination to terminate and prevent recurrence of atrial fibrillation [^d7fd2084]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

There is a need for improved approaches to rhythm control therapy of atrial fibrillation (AF).

Methods

The effectiveness of flecainide (1.5 µmol/L) and ibutilide (20 nmol/L), alone and in combination, to cardiovert and prevent AF recurrence was studied in canine-isolated coronary-perfused right atrioventricular preparations. We also examined the safety of the combination of flecainide (1.5 µmol/L) and ibutilide (50 nmol/L) using canine left ventricular wedge preparations.

Results

Sustained AF (>1 hour) was inducible in 100%, 60%, 20%, and 0% of atria in the presence of acetylcholine alone, acetylcholine+ibutilide, acetylcholine+flecainide, and acetylcholine+ibutilide+flecainide, respectively. When used alone, flecainide and ibutilide cardioverted sustained AF in 40% and 20% of atria, respectively, but in 100% of atria when used in combination. Ibutilide prolonged atrial and ventricular effective refractory period by 15% and 8%, respectively, at a cycle length of 500 ms ( P <0.05 for both). Flecainide increased the effective refractory period in atria by 27% ( P <0.01) but by only 2% in the ventricles. The combination of the 2 drugs lengthened the effective refractory period by 42% in atria ( P <0.01) but by only 7% ( P <0.05) in the ventricles. In left ventricular wedges, ibutilide prolonged QT and T peak -T end intervals by 25 and 55%, respectively ( P <0.05 for both; cycle length, 2000 ms). The addition of flecainide (1.5 µmol/L) partially reversed these effects ( P <0.05 for both parameters versus ibutilide alone). Torsades de Pointes score was relatively high with ibutilide alone and low with the drug combination.

Conclusions

In our experimental model, a combination of flecainide and ibutilide significantly improves cardioversion and prevents the recurrence of AF compared with monotherapies with little to no risk for the development of long-QT-mediated ventricular proarrhythmia.

### Ibutilide fumarate (corvert) [^25a7a42c]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Mechanism of Action:

CORVERT Injection prolongs action potential duration in isolated adult cardiac myocytes and increases both atrial and ventricular refractoriness in vivo, ie, class III electrophysiologic effects. Voltage clamp studies indicate that CORVERT, at nanomolar concentrations, delays repolarization by activation of a slow, inward current (predominantly sodium), rather than by blocking outward potassium currents, which is the mechanism by which most other class III antiarrhythmics act. These effects lead to prolongation of atrial and ventricular action potential duration and refractoriness, the predominant electrophysiologic properties of CORVERT in humans that are thought to be the basis for its antiarrhythmic effect.

Electrophysiologic Effects:

CORVERT produces mild slowing of the sinus rate and atrioventricular conduction. CORVERT produces no clinically significant effect on QRS duration at intravenous doses up to 0.03 mg/kg administered over a 10-minute period. Although there is no established relationship between plasma concentration and antiarrhythmic effect, CORVERT produces dose-related prolongation of the QT interval, which is thought to be associated with its antiarrhythmic activity. (See WARNINGS for relationship between QTc prolongation and torsades de pointes-type arrhythmias.) In a study in healthy volunteers, intravenous infusions of CORVERT resulted in prolongation of the QT interval that was directly correlated with ibutilide plasma concentration during and after 10-minute and 8-hour infusions. A steep ibutilide concentration/response (QT prolongation) relationship was shown. The maximum effect was a function of both the dose of CORVERT and the infusion rate.

Hemodynamic Effects:

A study of hemodynamic function in patients with ejection fractions both above and below 35% showed no clinically significant effects on cardiac output, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure at doses of CORVERT up to 0.03 mg/kg.

### Use of direct oral anticoagulants among patients undergoing cardioversion: the importance of timing before cardioversion [^393dbd91]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cardioversion, whether pharmacological or electrical, is associated with a risk of thromboembolic events on the order of 5% to 7% within 30 days in nonanticoagulated patients. 1, 2 The risk of thromboembolism is at its highest within the first 7 days after cardioversion (>80% of events), with the greatest risk within the first 2 days (≈70% of events). 3 Thus, the incidence of thromboembolic events within the first week is analogous to the yearly incidence in moderate‐risk nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients who have not undergone cardioversion. This risk can be mitigated to <1% within 30 days with the use of therapeutic anticoagulation before, during, and after cardioversion. 3 Thromboembolic risk is not negated by a low CHADS 2 (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, diabetes mellitus, stroke/transient ischemic attack), or CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc (adding vascular disease, age 65–74 years, and female sex) score or by a negative transthoracic esophageal echocardiogram (TEE) because of thrombus formation after cardioversion because of left atrial stunning. 3, 4 The single biggest risk factor for thrombus formation is inadequate anticoagulation. 4

The conventional approach is to anticoagulate, most commonly with an oral vitamin K antagonist (VKA), for a minimum of 3 weeks before, during, and for a minimum of 4 weeks postcardioversion. The recommendation to anticoagulate for 3 weeks before cardioversion is based on pathophysiologic and observational data, but has not been confirmed by randomized controlled trials. 5, 6 In addition, the retrospective analysis by Gallagher et al demonstrated that thromboembolic events were significantly more common at international normalized ratio (INR) 1.5 to 2.4 versus ≥2.5 (0.93% versus 0%, P =0.012), reinforcing the importance of establishing therapeutic anticoagulation before cardioversion. 7 Prior studies evaluating parenteral anticoagulation as a means to expedite time to cardioversion over conventional oral VKA therapy have all ensured “therapeutic anticoagulation” at the time of cardioversion. These studies have shown noninferiority between parenteral anticoagulation and conventional therapy, with cardioversion time ranging from 1 to 3 days versus 21 to 30 days, respectively. 8, 9

### Effect of flecainide and ibutilide alone and in combination to terminate and prevent recurrence of atrial fibrillation [^ceea193d]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Efficacy and Safety

Prolongation of atrial ERP is generally a reliable surrogate for the anti-AF efficacy of antiarrhythmic drugs. – Class III agents increase atrial ERP by prolonging APD, whereas class IC agents largely prolong atrial ERP by inducing PRR. It is expected that the flecainide and ibutilide combination would cause a greater atrial ERP prolongation than monotherapies, translating to a greater anti-AF efficacy of this combination than monotherapies in the clinical setting, as in our experimental study (Figures 2 and 4).

Although promising,,, use of combinations of antiarrhythmic drugs for rhythm control management of AF has not been comprehensively studied.Flecainide is a class IC agent that potently blocks both peak and late sodium channel currents (peak I Na and late I Na, respectively), and weakly inhibits the rapidly activating delayed rectified potassium current (I Kr).Flecainide also blocks the ryanodine receptor.Ibutilide, a class III agent, inhibits I Kr and enhances late I Na.The rationale for testing the combination of flecainide and ibutilide stemmed from the fact that flecainide due to its inhibition of both peak and late I Na would be expected to prolong ERP, thus adding to the anti-AF effects of ibutilide while limiting excessive prolongation of ventricular APD, thus preventing the long-QT–mediated torsadogenic effect of ibutilide. Likewise, the prolongation of atrial APD by ibutilide is expected to augment the increase in ERP by flecainide (Figure 2), thereby enhancing the anti-AF effect of flecainide. Note that I Kr inhibitors increase the effect of I Na blockers on the sodium channel–mediated parameters by decreasing diastolic interval (ie, reducing the recovery time), secondary to the prolongation of APD.Hence, the combination of the 2 drugs would be expected to increase the anti-AF efficacy compared with monotherapies while protecting against the development of acquired long QT and TdP. The present study provides experimental evidence in support of this hypothesis.
