## Question

when do we use antibiotics for small bowel obstruction

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when antibiotics should be used in small bowel obstruction and how to select appropriate regimens in different clinical situations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of SBO and whether antibiotics address the obstruction itself or only its complications. Then, I should verify the clinical triggers that require antibiotics, such as strangulation, ischemia, perforation, and peritonitis. Next, I will review management in uncomplicated partial versus complete SBO without ischemia. After that, I need to check special contexts like malignant bowel obstruction, Crohn's disease with bacterial overgrowth, and pediatric intussusception. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and specify empiric regimens and durations, making sure I anchor this to guideline-grade sources and correct any overstatements as I go.

> Let me first confirm the core principle: antibiotics do not relieve mechanical obstruction. They are used to prevent or treat complications such as bacterial translocation, ischemic injury with superinfection, perforation, and peritonitis, so I should not imply antibiotics are routine for all SBOs [^113V7zqS].

> Now, I will examine the scenarios that clearly require antibiotics, and I need to ensure I do not miss any red flags. Emergent surgical indications include generalized peritonitis, suspected or proven strangulation, ischemia, or perforation; in these cases, broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics should be started immediately and continued through source control, typically for 3–5 days if the source is controlled and longer if infection persists, per WSES intra-abdominal infection guidance and EAST SBO recommendations for timely exploration in deterioration [^116kBgKt] [^112zPWLr] [^111A1fLf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions for uncomplicated cases. In partial SBO without signs of ischemia, strangulation, or peritonitis, routine antibiotics are not recommended. Nonoperative management with NPO, IV fluids, and decompression is appropriate, and antibiotics should be avoided unless clinical deterioration develops or a specific infection risk emerges, which aligns with WSES and EAST guidance favoring selective nonoperative care [^1138bjgk] [^116PT8rb].

> For complete SBO, I initially thought antibiotics were routinely indicated, but wait, let me verify that nuance. Complete obstruction increases the risk of bacterial overgrowth and translocation, yet guidelines still advise antibiotics only when there are signs of ischemia, strangulation, or evolving peritonitis; otherwise, close observation with a low threshold to escalate is reasonable, with a water-soluble contrast challenge at 48–72 hours to predict resolution and guide the need for surgery rather than reflex antibiotics [^116U7Dsr] [^113tZY9q].

> Next, I should review malignant bowel obstruction, because practice often drifts toward reflex antibiotics. In inoperable malignant bowel obstruction, antibiotics are used to prevent or treat infection from bacterial overgrowth and translocation, alongside antisecretory and antiemetic therapy; this is a palliative, symptom-focused context where antibiotics are appropriate when infection risk or symptoms of bacterial overgrowth are present, guided by multidisciplinary care [^1173YuHE] [^1177DwjH].

> I will now examine Crohn's disease with strictures, where bacterial overgrowth above a fixed stricture is common. If SIBO is suspected or confirmed, targeted antibiotics are indicated to reduce bacterial load and symptoms; rifaximin is commonly used with reported eradication rates around 70%, though recurrence is frequent and rotating regimens may be needed, and this should be integrated with medical and surgical planning for the stricture itself [^116eqLwg] [^111Tw3B1] [^115KY9QD].

> But wait, what if the obstruction is in a child with intussusception? Do antibiotics help? I should double-check that. Antibiotics are not routinely indicated for idiopathic intussusception; management is nonoperative reduction when feasible, and antibiotics are reserved for suspected perforation, peritonitis, or hemodynamic instability, so I need to avoid implying routine antibiotic use here [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework and make sure I have not overgeneralized. Start by assessing for peritonitis, strangulation, ischemia, or perforation; if present, start broad-spectrum antibiotics immediately and proceed to source control. If uncomplicated partial SBO, avoid antibiotics and pursue nonoperative management. If complete SBO without ischemia, observe closely and consider a water-soluble contrast study at 48–72 hours; add antibiotics only if clinical deterioration occurs or if surgery is undertaken for contamination risk. In malignant obstruction or Crohn's-related SIBO, use antibiotics for infection prevention or SIBO treatment within a palliative or disease-specific plan [^116kBgKt] [^1138bjgk] [^116U7Dsr] [^116eqLwg].

> For empiric regimens when antibiotics are indicated, I should confirm coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic flora. Reasonable choices include a beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor such as piperacillin-tazobactam, or a third-generation cephalosporin plus metronidazole. In severe beta-lactam allergy, a carbapenem or combination like ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole can be used, with de-escalation to culture results if available and a duration of 3–5 days if the source is controlled and longer if infection persists, consistent with WSES intra-abdominal infection guidance [^116kBgKt].

> Finally, I need to ensure I have addressed duration and reassessment. If source control is achieved and the patient improves clinically, 3–5 days is usually sufficient. Ongoing fever, leukocytosis, or peritonitis beyond 5–7 days should trigger diagnostic re-evaluation for ongoing source or alternative diagnoses, aligning with WSES recommendations for intra-abdominal infection management and EAST guidance on timely surgical exploration when deterioration occurs [^116kBgKt] [^112zPWLr].

Antibiotics are **not routinely indicated** for uncomplicated small bowel obstruction (SBO) [^1138bjgk] without signs of ischemia, perforation, or peritonitis [^116nHuvB]. They are indicated when there is **clinical or radiologic evidence of ischemia, perforation, or peritonitis** [^112zPWLr], or when surgery is planned, to reduce the risk of infectious complications [^notfound]. For uncomplicated SBO, management is supportive with nasogastric decompression, IV fluids, and close monitoring [^116nHuvB]; antibiotics should be started if the patient deteriorates or if nonoperative management fails and surgery becomes necessary [^notfound].

## Indications for antibiotic use in SBO

Antibiotics are indicated in SBO **only in specific clinical scenarios**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication for antibiotics** |
|-|-|
| Ischemia, perforation, or peritonitis | Strong indication [^116kBgKt] |
| Planned surgical intervention | Prophylactic antibiotics recommended [^notfound] |
| Uncomplicated SBO (no ischemia, perforation, or peritonitis) | No routine indication [^notfound] |

---

## Evidence supporting antibiotic use

- **Ischemia, perforation, or peritonitis**: Antibiotics are indicated to prevent or treat infection due to bacterial translocation and contamination [^116kBgKt].

- **Planned surgical intervention**: Prophylactic antibiotics reduce postoperative infectious complications [^notfound].

- **Uncomplicated SBO**: Antibiotics do not improve outcomes and are not recommended routinely [^notfound].

---

## Risks and benefits of antibiotic use

Antibiotics provide clear benefits in complicated SBO by reducing infectious complications, but in uncomplicated SBO they offer **no benefit** and may cause harm, including antibiotic resistance, allergic reactions, and Clostridioides difficile infection.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

- **WSES 2018 guidelines**: Antibiotics are not indicated for uncomplicated SBO; use only when ischemia, perforation, or peritonitis is present or when surgery is planned [^notfound].

- **EAST 2012 guidelines**: Nonoperative management is appropriate for uncomplicated SBO; antibiotics are not routinely indicated [^116PT8rb].

- **WSES-AAST 2021 guidelines**: Antibiotics are indicated for complicated intra-abdominal infections, including SBO with ischemia, perforation, or peritonitis [^116kBgKt].

---

## Clinical scenarios where antibiotics are not indicated

Antibiotics are **not indicated** in uncomplicated SBO without ischemia, perforation, or peritonitis [^notfound]. Management is supportive — nasogastric decompression, IV fluids, and close monitoring — and antibiotics should be started only if the patient deteriorates or if nonoperative management fails and surgery becomes necessary [^116nHuvB].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Antibiotics are **not routinely indicated** for uncomplicated SBO [^notfound]. They are indicated when there is clinical or radiologic evidence of ischemia, perforation, or peritonitis, or when surgery is planned. For uncomplicated SBO, management is supportive, with close monitoring and escalation only if complications arise.

Subacute bowel obstruction

Experience suggests that important medical causes include abnormal electrolyte balance, opioid drugs, small bowel bacterial overgrowth, excessive faecal loading, severe fat malabsorption and excessive dietary fibre.

A trial of antibiotics and/or a low-fat diet (if steatorrhoea is present) and/or treatment with a bile acid sequestrant as appropriate may help. If the radiology suggests focal colonic faecal loading or a colonic site of obstruction or there is iron deficiency anaemia, colonoscopy should be considered. Excess fibre in the diet may precipitate subacute obstruction if a stricture is present. Some patients are very sensitive to opiates and can have prolonged colonic inertia even following small doses.

If low-fibre diets are indicated they should be prescribed by a qualified dietitian, should initially be time limited and the clinical benefit from the diet reviewed. Additional laxatives may be required. Data may emerge for the role of hyperbaric oxygen in treating patients with subacute obstruction due to radiation-induced fibrosis from the national ongoing HOT 2 trial (EudraCT No 2008–002152–26).

Surgery with a view to releasing adhesions or resecting strictures after previous pelvic radiotherapy can be particularly challenging because of dense abdominal fibrosis, and carries significantly higher risks of complications (eg, anastomotic leakages, postoperative intra-abdominal sepsis and intestinal fistulation) than surgery in a non-irradiated patient. Such surgery should be performed only by experienced surgeons with a low threshold for proximal faecal diversion. If an enteric motility disorder is also present (not uncommon), surgery may not lead to resolution of the symptoms.

Obstruction due to recurrent cancer

If cancer is present, the nature of the intervention should be influenced by the expected prognosis of the recurrence. Selected patients with no ascites, life expectancy > 2 months and good performance status may benefit from palliative decompressive surgery, but placement of self-expanding metal stents (if possible) appears to offer a better outcome. Expert medical management with opioids, antispasmodics (eg, hyoscine butyl bromide), antiemetics, antisecretory agents (eg, octreotide), corticosteroids and nasogastric tubes or venting gastrostomies can be effective in helping to control symptoms. Early input from surgeons and palliative care specialists should be sought.

Chronic syndromes: key facts

Symptoms are unreliable at identifying the underlying cause
Many cancer treatments have systemic effects and are not limited by normal anatomical boundaries
Patients may not report even severe symptoms reliably
Patients and clinicians may differ as to what constitute significant symptoms.

Thematic analysis of potential gaps in guideline adoption and proposed implementation strategies

System-level challenges, such as resource limitations and inconsistent multidisciplinary collaboration (when of benefit), further hinder guideline adherence. Resource limitations may necessitate deviation from or adaptation of clinical guidelines to embrace feasible alternatives, such as less resource-intensive diagnostics or therapies. It may be ideal to couple adaptations with telemedicine support from tertiary centres, to bridge resource gaps (including specialists) and create opportunities for collaboration around patient care. Additionally, promoting structured care pathways that integrate surgeons, radiologists, and intensivists into interdisciplinary teams can enhance decision-making consistency and quality, as well as improve adherence to evidence-informed practices. Collectively, addressing these barriers requires a tailored implementation strategy. Efforts to educate clinicians, inform and enable patients, and integrate standardized approaches into healthcare systems represent major areas for targeted interventions for healthcare systems that are not limited to the management of SBO. These approaches can be extrapolated to nearly every clinical condition requiring acute inpatient care.

Contraindications to a trial with long tube decompression include strangulation obstruction, malignant obstruction, incarcerated hernias, foreign body, radiation enteritis, and peritonitis.

In a series of 53 patients with ASBO and treated with long intestinal tube decompression, laparotomy is appropriate after non-response for 7 and 3 days for complete and partial SBO, respectively.

From further experiences, if ileus persists more than 3 days and the drainage volume on day 3 is > 500 ml, surgery for ASBO is recommended.

The EAST practice management guidelines for SBO recommend that patients without resolution of the SBO by day 3–5 of non-operative management should undergo water soluble study or surgery.

Finally when deciding between operative or non operative management it would be beneficial to assess the risk of ASBO recurrence after NOM and which factors can predict recurrence of ASBO after NOM

The patients non responders to the long-tube and conservative treatment within 72 hours have a considerable risk of recurrent ASBO (Level of Evidence 2b GoR C)

Risk factors for recurrences are age < 40 years and matted adhesion (Level of Evidence 1b GoR A)

Gastrografin use does not affect the recurrences rates or recurrences needing surgery when compared to traditionally conservatively treated patients (Level of Evidence 1b GoR A)

Out of 32,583 patients with an index admission for SBO in 1997 from an US population study, 24% had surgery during the index admission and regardless of treatment during the index admission, 81% of surviving patients had no additional SBO readmissions over the subsequent 5 years.

### Aetiology, diagnosis and management of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth [^113atxMs]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is a small bowel disorder characterised by excessive amounts of bacteria populating the small intestine leading to symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating and change in bowel habit. This creates some degree of diagnostic uncertainty due to the overlap of these symptoms with numerous other gastrointestinal conditions. Quantitative culture of jejunal aspirates is the gold standard diagnostic test but has largely been replaced by glucose and lactulose breath tests due to their relative ease and accessibility. The approach to treatment centres around reducing bacterial numbers through antibiotic therapy and managing any predisposing factors. Further research is required in order to define the optimum antibiotic choice and duration of therapy as well as the potential diagnostic utility of home breath testing and capsule-based technology.

Abstract

Background

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common surgical emergency associated with substantial morbidity, hospital length of stay (LOS), and healthcare cost. The World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) Bologna guidelines provide evidence-informed recommendations for managing adhesive SBO, promoting timely surgical intervention (or non-operative management (NOM) when ischaemia, strangulation, or peritonitis are absent). However, guideline adoption and its impact on outcomes remain under studied. Compliance with the Bologna guidelines was evaluated to determine the impact of compliance on outcomes.

Methods

SnapSBO, a prospective, multicentre, time-bound, observational cohort study, captured data on patients with adhesive SBO across diverse healthcare settings and patient populations. Patient care was categorized into: successful NOM, surgery after an unsuccessful appropriate trial of NOM (NOM-T), and direct to surgery (DTS). Compliance with diagnostic, therapeutic, and postoperative Bologna guideline recommendations was assessed as either complete or partial. Primary outcomes included adherence to the Bologna guidelines, LOS, complications, and the incidence of the composite metric 'optimal outcomes' (LOS ≤ 5 days, discharge without complications, and no readmission within 30 days).

Results

Among 982 patients with adhesive SBO, successful NOM occurred in 561 (57.1%), 224 (22.8%) underwent NOM-T, and 197 (20.1%) proceeded DTS. The mean(s.d.) LOS was 5.3(9.0), 12.9(11.4), and 7.7(8.0) days respectively (P < 0.001). Optimal outcomes were achieved in 61.0%, 16.1%, and 37.6% respectively (P < 0.001) and full guideline compliance was observed in 17.2%, 10.1%, and 0.4% respectively.

Conclusion

Patients with adhesive SBO whose care was aligned with the Bologna guidelines had a shorter LOS and a greater incidence of optimal outcomes. Addressing evidence-to-practice gaps through implementation strategies that consider contextual factors will enhance guideline adoption and patient outcomes.

### Medical management of inoperable malignant bowel obstruction [^1173YuHE]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review medical management of inoperable malignant bowel obstruction.

Data Sources

A literature review using PubMed and MEDLINE databases searching malignant bowel obstruction, etiology, types, pathophysiology, medical, antisecretory, anti-inflammatory, antiemetic drugs, analgesics, promotion of emptying, prevention of infection, anticholinergics, somatostatin analogs, gastric antisecretory drugs, prokinetic agents, glucocorticoid, opioid analgesics, antibiotics, enema, and adverse effects.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Randomized or observational studies, cohorts, case reports, or reviews written in English between 1983 and November 2020 were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

Malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) commonly occurs in patients with advanced or recurrent malignancies and severely affects the quality of life and survival of patients. Its management remains complex and variable. Medical management is the cornerstone of MBO treatment, with the goal of reducing distressing symptoms and optimizing quality of life. Until now, there has been neither a standard clinical approach nor registered medications to treat patients with inoperable MBO.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

This review provides information on the etiology, type and pathophysiology, and medical treatment of MBO and related adverse reactions of the drugs commonly used, which can greatly assist clinicians in making clinical decisions when treating MBO.

Conclusions

Published research shows that medical management of MBO mainly consists of antisecretory, anti-inflammatory strategies, controlling vomiting and pain, promoting emptying, preventing infection, and combination therapy. Being knowledgeable about the most current treatment options, the related adverse effects, and the evidence supporting different practices is critical for clinicians to provide individualized medical therapy for MBO patients.

Approach to the patient with ASBO

An algorithm for the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to the patient with ASBO is presented in Fig. 2. The initial diagnosis of ASBO is of utmost importance. Failure to diagnose or having a delayed diagnosis represents 70% of malpractice claims in ASBO.

Fig. 2
Algorithm to diagnosis and treatment of ASBO

The primary goals in the initial evaluation of patients in whom adhesive small bowel obstruction is suspected are:
Differentiating between adhesive small bowel obstruction and other causes of bowel obstruction
Assessing the need for urgent surgical exploration
Identifying and preventing complications from bowel obstruction

History taking and physical examination

History taking in a patient suspected for ASBO includes assessment of potential causes of bowel obstruction (previous operations, radiotherapy) and nutritional status. Signs of dehydration should also be assessed. Traditionally, ASBO is clinically diagnosed in a patient with intermittent colicky abdominal pain, distention, and nausea (with or without vomiting), with or without absence of stools. Although diagnosis of small bowel obstruction is fairly certain in a patient in whom all of these symptoms are present, there are some specific pitfalls that can result in delayed or misdiagnosis of bowel obstruction upon initial presentation. In patients with incomplete obstruction, watery diarrhea may be present. The presence of watery diarrhea can cause an episode of ASBO to be mistaken for gastro-enteritis. Stools might also be present in patients with a relatively high obstruction who are admitted early after onset of symptoms. Moreover, not all of these symptoms may be present, especially in the elderly in whom pain is often less prominent.

During physical examination, signs of peritonitis that might reveal strangulation or ischemia should be evaluated. Differential diagnostic considerations that can be assessed during physical examination include the presence of any abdominal wall or groin hernias. The evaluation of ASBO by history taking and physical examination has a low sensitivity for detecting bowel strangulation and ischemia. Sensitivity of physical examination for detection of strangulation is only 48%, even in experienced hands.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2017 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO working group [^112QB3NV]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) is one of the leading causes of surgical emergencies and in particular of surgical emergencies that require an emergent operations. In the UK, small bowel obstruction was the indication for 51% of all emergency laparotomies. Scott et al. reported on seven emergency surgical procedures that account for 80% of all general surgery emergency admissions, morbidity, deaths, and healthcare expenditures in the USA. Adhesive small bowel obstruction was the most common diagnosis for both the top 2 (small bowel resection) and top 5 (adhesiolysis) procedures. Post-operative adhesions are the leading cause of small bowel obstructions, accounting for 60% of cases.

ASBO causes considerable harm, resulting in 8 days of hospitalization on average and an in-hospital mortality rate of 3% per episode. Between 20 and 30% of patients with adhesive small bowel obstruction require operative treatment. Length of hospitalization and morbidity depend on the need for surgical intervention. Average hospitalization after surgical treatment of ASBO is 16 days, compared to 5 days following non-operative treatment. Associated costs in a Dutch study in 2016 were estimated at €16,305 for surgical and €2227 for non-operative treatment.

Although adhesive small bowel obstruction is a common condition, the prevention and treatment is often characterized by surgeons' personal preferences rather than standardized evidence-based protocols. There is a large amount of conflicting and low-quality evidence in publications regarding treatment of adhesive small bowel obstruction.

Therefore, the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) working group on ASBO has developed evidence-based guidelines to support clinical decision making in diagnosis and management of ASBO. In the present revision of these guidelines, all recommendations were updated according to the latest evidence available from the medical literature. Further, we have introduced two new sections: prevention of ASBO and special patient groups.

Further matter of debate are how long should NOM be and when it should be discontinued?

Usually NOM, in absence of signs of strangulation or peritonitis, can be prolonged up to 72 hours of adhesive SBO (Level of Evidence 2b GoR C)

After 3 days without resolution, WSCA study or surgery is recommended (Level of Evidence 2b GoR C)

If ileus persists more than 3 days and the drainage volume on day 3 is > 500 ml, surgery for ASBO is recommended (Level of Evidence 2b GoR C)

With closely monitoring and in the absence of signs suggestive of complications, an observation period even longer than 10 days before proceeding to surgical intervention appears to be safe.

However at any time, if onset of fever and leukocytosis greater than 15 000/mm3 (predictors of intestinal complications) are observed, then NOM should be discontinued and surgery is recommended.

In the experience from the retrospective series of Cox et al. out of 123 patients initially managed with conservative treatment, 31 of 38 patients requiring surgical intervention for SBO, had so more than 48 h duration after admission and the difference between cases resolving within 48 h and those requiring surgery after 48 h was significant (p < 0.001). Therefore most cases of ASBO that will resolve, seem to do so within 48 h of admission.

Fleshner et al. in their RCT comparing conservative management of ASBO with NGT or LT, reported that, between the 21 patients ultimately requiring operation, the mean period between admission and operation was 60 hours in the NGT group versus 65 hours in the LT group.

In a series of 35 patients with ASBO, a long intestinal tube was endoscopically placed and the decompression was successful in up to 90% of the cases. Therefore the authors recommend for patients with ASBO, a trial with long tube decompression for 48 to 72 hours. For those who fail a trial with the long tube, laparotomy with enterolysis or bowel resection is indicated.

### SBO ACTION: conservative small bowel obstruction management in the absence of standard conTrast agents ON outcomes [^116cMkPD]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

However, the study's strengths lie in its modern, prospective, and multicentre nature, which is necessary for capturing variations in practice. This approach has generated testable hypotheses and provided valuable insights into how surgeons have translated data from clinical trials into real-world practice. Although sites were provided with general guidance, contrast administration and follow-up protocols were not strictly standardized, which may have introduced variability in practice. Furthermore, the data collected were unable to fully capture factors such as the presence of a hostile abdomen, which may have influenced treatment decisions. A recent survey of surgeons examining their beliefs and rationale for WSCA use found considerable divergence in opinions about its primary mode of action — whether diagnostic, therapeutic, or both. These findings highlight the need for greater standardization in contrast use protocols and a clearer understanding of when and why WSCA is employed in clinical practice. Future research should explore patient-reported outcomes and alternative contrast agents to further optimize the management of aSBO.

Materials and methods

Study design and data collection

The study was a single-institution retrospective review of patients treated in the General Surgery Department of Trieste's University Hospital. Ethical committee approval was obtained according to the Italian law, and the study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice. Were considered for inclusion in the study all the patients aged 18 or older, admitted to our institution from January 2018 to the end of December 2018 with diagnosis of acute cholecystitis, appendicitis, non-traumatic gastrointestinal perforation or bowel obstruction, and in which the indication to emergency surgical procedure was considered as first choice of treatment or as salvage surgery when previous non-operative management failed (e.g. antibiotic treatment, percutaneous drainage, stenting). Non-traumatic gastrointestinal perforation included gastroduodenal perforation due to peptic ulcer disease, small bowel perforation, and colonic perforation with both neoplastic (colorectal cancer) and non-neoplastic (perforated diverticular disease) etiology. Bowel obstruction included small bowel obstruction caused by adhesions, tumors, gallstone ileus or foreign bodies, and large bowel obstruction caused by colorectal cancer. Exclusion criteria were: patients < 18, bowel obstruction or perforation as a complication of abdominal wall hernias, bowel obstruction or perforation which occurred as a postoperative complication, multiple simultaneous surgical procedures (more than one CPT code), missing preoperative or postoperative data.

### Small bowel obstruction [^114kRHNP]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Identifying patients with small bowel obstruction who need operative intervention and those who will fail nonoperative management is a challenge. Without indications for urgent intervention, a computed tomography scan with/without intravenous contrast should be obtained to identify location, grade, and etiology of the obstruction. Most small bowel obstructions resolve with nonoperative management. Open and laparoscopic operative management are acceptable approaches. Malnutrition needs to be identified early and managed, especially if the patient is to undergo operative management. Confounding conditions include age greater than 65, post Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, inflammatory bowel disease, malignancy, virgin abdomen, pregnancy, hernia, and early postoperative state.

### Emergency medicine evaluation and management of small bowel obstruction: evidence-based recommendations [^111jwYqH]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a commonly diagnosed disease in the emergency department (ED). Recent literature has evaluated the ED investigation and management of SBO.

Objective

This review evaluates the ED investigation and management of adult SBO based on the current literature.

Discussion

SBO is most commonly due to occlusion of the small intestine, resulting in fluid and gas accumulation. This may progress to mucosal ischemia, necrosis, and perforation. A variety of etiologies are present, but in adults, adhesions are the most common cause. Several classification systems are present. However, the most important distinction is complete vs. partial and complicated vs. simple obstruction, as complete complicated SBO more commonly requires surgical intervention. History and physical examination can vary, but the most reliable findings include prior abdominal surgery, history of constipation, abdominal distension, and abnormal bowel sounds. Signs of strangulation include fever, hypotension, diffuse abdominal pain, peritonitis, and several others. Diagnosis typically requires imaging, and though plain radiographs are often ordered, they cannot exclude the diagnosis. Computed tomography and ultrasound are reliable diagnostic methods. Management includes intravenous fluid resuscitation, analgesia, and determining need for operative vs. nonoperative therapy. Nasogastric tube is useful for patients with significant distension and vomiting by removing contents proximal to the site of obstruction. Surgery is needed for strangulation and those that fail nonoperative therapy. Surgical service evaluation and admission are recommended.

Conclusion

SBO is a common reason for admission from the ED. Knowledge of recent literature can optimize diagnosis and management.

Small-bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common clinical condition with signs and symptoms similar to other acute abdominal disorders. The radiologic investigation of patients with SBO as well as the indications and timing of surgical intervention have changed over the past 2 decades. This review focuses on modern imaging techniques and their role in both the diagnosis and treatment of patients with SBO.

A further update of this series including 127 patients not only confirmed the same findings in terms of reduction of resolution of the obstruction and of the hospital stay [mean time to first stool 6.2 hours vs 23.5 (p < .0001) and mean hospital stay for unoperated patients 2.7 vs 5.5 days, (p < .0001)], but also showed as well that significantly fewer episodes in the trial group required operation, 10.4% vs 26.7% (p < 0.013).

Further evidence has been showed that the use of hyperosmolar Water-soluble contrast medium (Gastrografin) in ASBO is safe and reduces the need for surgery when conservative treatment fails (after 48 hrs) and in patients showing partial SBO. In the prospective RCT from Choi et al. the patients showing no clinical and radiologic improvement in the initial 48 hours of conservative treatment for non complicated ASBO were randomized to undergo either Gastrografin meal and follow-through study or surgery. Nineteen patients were randomized to undergo Gastrografin meal and follow-through study and 16 patients to surgery.

Gastrografin study revealed partial obstruction in 14 patients. Obstruction resolved subsequently in all of them after a mean of 41 hours. The other five patients underwent laparotomy because the contrast study showed complete obstruction. The use of Gastrografin significantly reduced the need for surgery by 74%. Therefore the use of Gastrografin in ASBO is safe and reduces the need for surgery when conservative treatment fails.

These results have been validated in a further study where 44 episodes of ASBO showing no improvement after 48 hours of conservative management received Gastrografin and out of them 7 underwent becuase of finding of complete obstruction whereas Partial obstruction was demonstrated in 37 other cases, obstruction resolved subsequently in all of them except one patient who required laparotomy because of persistent obstruction.

Biondo et al. demonstrated that water-soluble contrast reduces the hospital stay but does not reduce the need for surgery. After randomizing 83 patients with 90 episodes of ASBO to either 100 mL of Gastrografin or control, conservative treatment was successful in 77 episodes (85.6 per cent), among patients treated conservatively hospital stay was shorter in the Gastrografin group (P < 0.001) and all patients in whom contrast medium reached the colon tolerated an early oral diet; however Gastrografin did not reduce the need for operation (P = 1.000).

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2010 evidence-based guidelines of the World Society of Emergency Surgery [^117RvbkC]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

There is no consensus on diagnosis and management of ASBO. Initial conservative management is usually safe, however proper timing for discontinuing non operative treatment is still controversial. Open surgery or laparoscopy are used without standardized indications.

Methods

A panel of 13 international experts with interest and background in ASBO and peritoneal diseases, participated in a consensus conference during the 1st International Congress of the World Society of Emergency Surgery and 9th Peritoneum and Surgery Society meeting, in Bologna, July 1–3, 2010, for developing evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis and management of ASBO. Whenever was a lack of high-level evidence, the working group formulated guidelines by obtaining consensus.

Recommendations

In absence of signs of strangulation and history of persistent vomiting or combined CT scan signs (free fluid, mesenteric oedema, small bowel faeces sign, devascularized bowel) patients with partial ASBO can be managed safely with NOM and tube decompression (either with long or NG) should be attempted. These patients are good candidates for Water Soluble Contrast Medium (WSCM) with both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The appearance of water-soluble contrast in the colon on X-ray within 24 hours from administration predicts resolution. WSCM may be administered either orally or via NGT (50–150 ml) both immediately at admission or after an initial attempt of conservative treatment of 48 hours. The use of WSCM for ASBO is safe and reduces need for surgery, time to resolution and hospital stay.NOM, in absence of signs of strangulation or peritonitis, can be prolonged up to 72 hours. After 72 hours of NOM without resolution surgery is recommended. Patients treated non-operatively have shorter hospital stay, but higher recurrence rate and shorter time to re-admission, although the risk of new surgically treated episodes of ASBO is unchanged. Risk factors for recurrences are age < 40 years and matted adhesions. WSCM does not affect recurrence rates or recurrences needing surgery when compared to traditional conservative treatment. Open surgery is the preferred method for surgical treatment of strangulating ASBO as well as after failed conservative management. In selected patients and with appropriate skills, laparoscopic approach can be attempted using open access technique. Access in the left upper quadrant should be safe. Laparoscopic adhesiolysis should be attempted preferably in case of first episode of SBO and/or anticipated single band. A low threshold for open conversion should be maintained. Peritoneal adhesions should be prevented. Hyaluronic acid-carboxycellulose membrane and icodextrin can reduce incidence of adhesions. Icodextrin may reduce the risk of re-obstruction. HA cannot reduce need of surgery.

### Small bowel obstruction and perforation attributed to tubo-ovarian abscess following' D' and' C' [^117FEfgS]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

During surgical abortion, perforation of the uterus can occur or there may be damage to the cervix, which can predispose to the risk of preterm labour in subsequent pregnancies (cervical incompetence). There is also an increased risk of injury to infected tissue such as a tubo-ovarian abscess and spreading of the infection. In general, surgical procedures of the female genital tract place the patient at risk for pelvic inflammatory disease, with about 15% of pelvic infections occurring after procedures that break the cervical mucous barrier. The incidence of upper genital tract infection associated with first-trimester abortion is about 1 in 200 cases and the incidence of complications after a first-trimester D&C is 1.7%. Uterine perforation with small bowel involvement is rare in 1 st trimester abortion. Shulman et al. reported a case of uterine perforation and small bowel incarceration two days after a first trimester surgical abortion and correlated the sonographic and surgical findings. Without a preliminary ultrasound scan it is uncertain in this case if the tubo-ovarian abscess was present at the time of the 'D' and 'C' or was a complication of the procedure. The clinical course of the combined complications of a tubo-ovarian abscess with small bowel obstruction and small bowel perforation can be explained in four possible patterns: (1) contaminated curettage instruments, (2) pre-existing tubo-ovarian abscess, (3) 'sealed –off' tubo-ovarian perforation and (4) unrecognized uterine injury with intra-abdominal involvement. The evidence for (2) and (3) is that pelvic inflammatory disease may fix the uterus and moving it with dilators may tear it, spread the pus, and cause a fatal peritonitis. The evidence for (4) is the presence of the ileal perforation within the abscess cavity and, the rarity of the reverse occurring - a tubo-ovarian abscess perforating into small bowel. In a clinically stable patient diagnosed with small bowel obstruction associated with pelvic inflammatory disease, conservative treatment including antibiotic therapy should be attempted before any operative intervention is considered. Although laparoscopic adhesiolysis requires a specific skill set and may not be appropriate in all patients it demonstrates a benefit in 30-day morbidity and mortality but should be performed by experienced laparaoscopic surgeons. Laparoscopic management of acute peritonitis is also well established Table 1.

4.8.3 Enterovaginal and enterovesical fistulae

Statement 58. We recommend that enterovaginal and enterovesical fistulae should be managed jointly with medical control of inflammation and surgical resection (GRADE: strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%).

Data on the management of non-perianal fistulae, especially from randomised trials, are limited. There are even more limited data on the outcomes of patients treated for specifically entero-gynaecological or enterovesical fistula. Although these fistulae are rare, they are a serious problem to patients with Crohn's disease. A systematic literature review showed that response to medical therapy (fistula closure) was complete in 38.3% of rectovaginal fistulae and 65.9% of enterovesical fistulae. For enterovesical fistulae, risk factors for the need for surgical intervention include sigmoid origin and other complications of Crohn's disease including small bowel obstruction, abscess formation, other fistulation, ureteric obstruction or urinary tract infection. These authors suggest that enterovesical fistulae should be treated medically initially, with surgery reserved for those with bowel obstruction or abscess formation, non-responders or recurrence after medical therapy. In a series of 47 patients with genital fistulae, antibiotics had no lasting benefit, thiopurines resulted in 13% complete and 24% partial response, and anti TNF-alpha therapy gave 17% complete and 30% partial response. Surgery was undertaken in a third of patients, but only 22% had complete response after a first operation and 39% after reintervention. Overall, fistula closure was only achieved in a third of patients.

These studies highlight that there is still very limited evidence on which to base specific management guidance, but medical therapy alone or in combination with surgery would appear to offer benefit to some patients in the management of enterovaginal and enterovesical fistulae. Patients should be discussed in multidisciplinary meetings and treatment individualised, considering patients' symptoms and situation.

4.8.4 Enteroenteric fistulae

Enteroenteric fistulae are often asymptomatic and expert consensus guidelines have recognised that these do not always require surgery.

### A systematic review of outcomes reported in small bowel obstruction research [^117G2eah]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a condition which is commonly treated by general surgeons. The evidence base for treatment of this condition is limited in part by variable reporting of outcomes in the literature. The aim of this study was to identify commonly used outcomes in research on SBO.

Methods

This review was reported in line with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017065538). Searches were performed of MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases to identify prospective cohort or randomized trials reporting outcomes of interventions in SBO. Studies addressing diagnostics, pediatric populations, and SBO due to malignancy were excluded. Studies were screened for inclusion. Study and outcome characteristics were extracted into a -predesigned pro forma and mapped onto the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) framework.

Results

A total of 1222 studies were screened for eligibility, 74 full text articles retrieved, and 51 studies included for synthesis. A total of 50 different outcomes were used. Duration of hospital stay was the most frequently reported outcome (n = 21 studies). Resolution of SBO was reported in 12 studies but only defined in eight studies which used six different definitions. Patient-reported outcomes were reported in only four studies.

Conclusions

There is a high degree of variation in the outcomes reported in SBO research. There is a clear need for a core outcome set. Development of a patient-reported outcome measure for this condition should also be explored.

The median time to GI recovery was shorter in the no-contrast group at 1 day (i.q.r. 1–2) versus 2 days (i.q.r. 1–5) for the contrast group (P < 0.001). The median hospital length of stay was 4 days (i.q.r. 2–7) for the non-contrast group versus 6 days (i.q.r. 3–12) for the contrast group (P < 0.001). Similarly, among patients who underwent surgery, those who received a contrast challenge had a longer median hospital length of stay (13 days, i.q.r. 9–24 versus 7 days, i.q.r. 6–15, P = 0.033, q = 0.4; Supplementary Material S7).

### SBO ACTION: conservative small bowel obstruction management in the absence of standard conTrast agents ON outcomes [^113RA4MJ]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

A key risk of NOM is the potential for bowel ischaemia. In the present cohort, 25.3% of patients who underwent surgery after an initial trial of NOM had intraoperative evidence of ischaemia, reinforcing the importance of careful patient selection and close monitoring. Emergent surgery is necessary for patients with clinical or radiological signs suggestive of bowel ischemia. Although delaying surgery may allow resolution in select cases, prolonged NOM in the presence of ongoing obstruction increases the risk of irreversible bowel injury. Notably, the rate of ischaemia did not significantly differ between those who received WSCA and those who did not, suggesting that contrast administration itself does not exacerbate this risk. However, the longer time to surgery observed in the WSCA group highlights the need for a clear threshold for when NOM should be considered unsuccessful.

The study is not without limitations. Its observational design means the findings are of association only, and not causation. Patients selected for WSCA challenges did not have lower CCI, and experienced higher rates of surgery and longer times to operation. This means surgeons are potentially deferring surgery in cases where it is ultimately anticipated, introducing selection bias. Time to GI-2 was recorded in days rather than hours. Although this provides a practical estimate, this may limit precision in assessing subtle differences in recovery time. The 30-day follow-up period is relatively short, and the absence of patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) limits insight into the impact of treatment strategies from the patient's perspective. Additionally, data on operative details and ischaemia were poorly reported, as was the documentation of CFS data. The impact of aSBO and its management on quality of life, symptom burden, and post-discharge recovery remains underexplored in the current literature. The PRO-diGI PROM for gastrointestinal recovery has been developed for use in this population, and might be utilized in future studies.

Malignant bowel obstruction is a challenging clinical problem encountered in patients with advanced abdominal and pelvic malignancies. Although medical therapies form the foundation of management, some patients may be suitable candidates for surgical and procedural interventions. The literature is composed primarily of retrospective single-institution experiences and the results of prospective trials are pending. Given the high symptom burden and limited life expectancy of these patients, management may be best informed by multidisciplinary teams with relevant expertise.

5) Intestinal obstruction

Statement 5.5.1

Surgery is mandatory for symptomatic strictures that do not respond to medical therapy and are not amenable to endoscopic dilatation (QoE C).

Statement 5.5.2

Any colorectal stricture should be assessed with endoscopic biopsies to ensure the absence of malignancy (QoE C).

Recommendation

We recommend performing surgery in patients presenting with bowel obstruction because of fibrotic or medically resistant stenosis (strong recommendation based on low-level evidence 1C).

Summary of evidence and discussion

Small bowel obstruction is the most common complication requiring elective surgery in CD and affects up to 54% of patients. Strictures complicating CD usually affect the small bowel but could arise anywhere in the GI tract and could be divided into inflammatory or fibrostenotic. It is often difficult to distinguish whether the obstruction is caused primarily by inflammation or fibrostenosis. Patients with inflammatory disease deserve a trial of medications aimed at reducing inflammation. Conversely, patients with symptomatic fibrostenotic disease and obstruction require an interventional approach, either surgical or endoscopic.

Endoscopic balloon dilation has proven successful in the management of primary intestinal strictures or anastomotic strictures in CD. For fibrotic strictures, endoscopic balloon dilation has a technical success rate of 89 to 92%, with 70 to 81% patients experiencing short-term relief of symptoms. Long-term results are less impressive, with 73.5% of patients requiring a repeat dilation and 43% requiring surgical intervention within 2 years.

Endoscopic stricturotomy is an evolving, novel therapy for which only few short-term retrospective studies exist to demonstrate its safety and efficacy compared with endoscopic balloon dilation or ileocolic resection.

Large bowel strictures, especially in UC, should raise high concern for malignancy. When required to perform an emergent colectomy, oncologic principles should be followed. Patients with small bowel stenosis mainly due to inflammation may improve with medical treatment such as steroids. In patients that do not show improvement with medical treatments, suspect stenosis due to fibrosis, and consider radiological investigation with CT or MR enterography and the possibility of endoscopic dilation on the basis of the length and site of the stenosis, the number of stenotic sites, and the presence of ulcers.

Surgery is warranted for small bowel CD stenosis that causes an intestinal obstruction with potential impending perforation, with long or multiple strictures, when the stricture is not endoscopically accessible and when medical and/or endoscopic treatment fails to adequately improve the patient's symptoms or when there is concern about concomitant malignancy.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^116kBgKt]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

According to WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections (IAI), judicious use of antimicrobials is an integral part of good clinical practice. This approach minimizes the risks associated with the selection of resistant pathogens. In critically ill patients, antimicrobial therapy should be started as soon as possible. In these patients to ensure timely and effective administration of antibiotics, always consider the pathophysiological status of the patient as well as the pharmacokinetic properties of the employed antibiotics. In patients with uncomplicated IAI, where the source of infection is treated definitively, post-operative antibiotic therapy is not necessary. In patients with complicated IAI undergoing an adequate source-control procedure, a short course of antibiotic therapy (3–5 days) is always recommended. Patients who have ongoing signs of peritonitis or systemic illness (ongoing infection) beyond 5 to 7 days of antibiotic treatment, warrant a diagnostic investigation. The choice of empiric antibiotic regimens in patients with IAI should be based on the clinical condition of the patients, the individual risk for infection by resistant pathogens, and the local resistance epidemiology. The regimen will be adapted to intra-operative cultures that allow expansion of the antimicrobial regimen if the initial choice is too narrow and to perform a de-escalation if the empirical regimen is too broad. When a microorganism is identified in clinical cultures, antimicrobial susceptibility testing should always be performed and reported to guide antibiotic therapy.

In the specific setting of complicated RP, the presence of strangulation or intestinal obstruction increases the risk of bacterial translocation and therefore an empiric antimicrobial therapy is suggested. After proper conservative management of incarcerated RP, there is no indication for antibiotic therapy, in absence of signs of systemic infection. In case of NOM failure and surgical treatment of RP, the antimicrobial therapy should be re-evaluated after surgery to decide, based on the intra-operative findings, whether it should be continued, discontinued, implemented, or de-escalated. Patients can also present with RP and peritonitis or sepsis/septic shock: in these cases, a proper and timely antimicrobial therapy is of utmost importance. For a throughout discussion of antimicrobial therapy in patients with IAI, we refer to WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections.

### Small bowel obstruction: the role of computed tomography in its diagnosis and management with reference to other imaging modalities [^116xqD16]. European Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction is a leading cause of acute surgical admissions for abdominal pain. There is an increasing tendency for initial conservative management rather than immediate operative intervention, as a proportion of cases will resolve spontaneously. This has resulted in a growing reliance on radiological investigations to reassure the surgeon that medical therapy can be safely instituted. The onus therefore rests with radiologists to guide their surgical colleagues by correctly interpreting the plain abdominal radiograph and suggesting appropriate further investigation if warranted. Recently, computed tomography (CT) has been proposed as the test of choice to define the level and cause of acute small bowel obstruction and to identify complications such as ischaemia and perforation which will prompt surgical intervention. This review will discuss the utility of early CT in the diagnosis of acute small bowel obstruction and outline its impact on patient management.

Crohn's disease — when to refer for surgery and common indications: Surgery may be considered for symptomatic CD localized to a short segment of bowel, and surgery is required to treat emergent complications. A resection of a segment of diseased intestine is the most common surgery for a patient with CD. Indications include intractable hemorrhage, perforation, persisting or recurrent obstruction, abscess, dysplasia or cancer, or medically refractory disease; the most common indication for intestinal resection is small bowel obstruction from a fibrostenotic stricture, with penetrating CD as the second most common. Although resection is the most definitive treatment for a stricture, strictureplasty is an option as a bowel‑preserving measure in patients at risk for short bowel syndrome; multidisciplinary management and early surgical consultation are appropriate.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2010 evidence-based guidelines of the World Society of Emergency Surgery [^112o6KZE]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

CT scan is highly diagnostic in SBO and has a great value in all patients with inconclusive plain films for complete or high grade SBO. However CT-scans should not be routinely performed in the decision-making process except when clinical history, physical examination, and plain film are not conclusive for small bowel obstruction diagnosis. CT can confirm the presence of complete obstruction and allow the diagnosis of the cause of SBO, it can also exclude a non-adhesional pathology and assess the occurrence of strangulation with a sensitivity and specificity higher than 90% and a NPV of nearly 100%.

IV contrast is necessary. Oral is not

Water-soluble contrast follow-through is valuable in patients undergoing initial non operative conservative management in order to rule out complete ASBO and predict the need for surgery.

This investigation is safer than barium in cases of perforation and peritoneal spread and has possible therapeutic value in the case of adhesive small intestine obstruction.

MRI use should be restricted to those patients having CT or iodine contrast contraindications.

- Conservative treatment and timing for surgery

The management of small bowel obstruction caused by adhesions is controversial because surgery can induce new adhesions, whereas conservative treatment does not remove the cause of the obstruction. Conservative treatment involves nasogastric intubation, intravenous fluid administration, and clinical observation. Strangulation of the bowel requires immediate surgery, but intestinal ischemia can be difficult to determine clinically. Several issues are raised when managing patients with ASBO.

The first question is whether to operate or not to operate

Patients without the signs of strangulation or peritonitis or history of persistent vomiting or combination of CT scan signs (free fluid, mesenteric oedema, lack of faeces signa, devascularized bowel) and partial ASBO can safely undergo non-operative management (LoE 1a GoR A)

In the absence of any signs of strangulation, patients with an adhesive SBO can be managed safely with non-operative treatment and tube decompression should be attempted (Level of Evidence 1b GoR A)

Patients who had surgery within the six weeks before the episode of small bowel obstruction, patients with signs of strangulation or peritonitis (fever, tachycardia and leucocytosis, metabolic acidosis and continuous pain), patients with irreducible hernia and patients who started to have signs of resolution at the time of admission are NOT candidate for conservative treatment ± WSCA administration (Level of Evidence 1a GoR A)

Diagnosis: summary

Recommendations can be found in Table 5. In summary, CT scan with oral water-soluble contrast is the preferred technique of imaging in the initial evaluation. Progress of the contrast should be monitored after 24 h of non-operative treatment by X-ray. If the diagnosis of ASBO is certain (e.g. because other causes have been excluded with recent imaging), and there are no signs that immediate surgery might be warranted, only a water-soluble contrast study is considered sufficient. Ultrasound and MRI can be useful in specific situations, such as pregnancy or (in low income countries) when CT scan is unavailable.

Table 5
Overview of conclusions and recommendation

Management

Initial decision making

Non-operative management should always be tried in patients with adhesive small bowel obstruction, unless there are signs of peritonitis, strangulation, or bowel ischemia. Although the risk of recurrence is slightly lower after operative treatment, this is not a reason to opt for a primary surgical approach. Morbidity from emergency surgical exploration is high; there is a considerable risk for bowel injury, and surgical treatment may significantly reduce post-operative quality of life.

In summary, a systematic review and meta-analysis of imaging, clinical, and laboratory variables of patients with small bowel obstruction identified 6 potential predictors associated strongly with the need for surgery (5 positively and 1 negatively; 3 were derived from CT), and 3 associated strongly with ischaemia at surgery (all positively; 2 were derived from CT). The development of future multivariable models to guide the management of small bowel obstruction should concentrate on variables that appear to display strong evidence of potential utility. Factors that have not been investigated sufficiently well in the primary literature but which enjoy considerable clinical support should also be considered.

### Evaluation and management of small-bowel obstruction: an Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma practice management guideline [^111t77Y3]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Small-bowel obstruction (SBO) represents as many as 16% of surgical admissions and more than 300,000 operations annually in the United States. The optimal strategies for the diagnosis and management of SBO continue to evolve secondary to advances in imaging techniques, critical care, and surgical techniques. This updated systematic literature review was developed by the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma to provide up-to-date evidence-based recommendations for SBO.

Methods

A search of the National Library of Medicine MEDLINE database was performed using PubMed interface for articles published from 2007 to 2011.

Results

The search identified 53 new articles that were then combined with the 131 studies previously reviewed by the 2007 guidelines. The updated guidelines were then presented at the 2012 annual EAST meeting.

Conclusion

Level I evidence now exists to recommend the use of computed tomographic scan, especially multidetector computed tomography with multiplanar reconstructions, in the evaluation of patients with SBO because it can provide incremental clinically relevant information over plains films that may lead to changes in management. Patients with evidence of generalized peritonitis, other evidence of clinical deterioration, such as fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, and continuous pain, or patients with evidence of ischemia on imaging should undergo timely exploration. The remainder of patients can safely undergo initial nonoperative management for both partial and complete SBO. Water-soluble contrast studies should be considered in patients who do not clinically resolve after 48 to 72 hours for both diagnostic and potential therapeutic purposes. Laparoscopic treatment of SBO has been demonstrated to be a viable alternative to laparotomy in selected cases.

### Bowel obstruction… [^11485a6S]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

The condition may be treated conservatively or with surgery. Typically intravenous fluids are given, a nasogastric tube is placed through the nose into the stomach to decompress the intestines, and pain medications are given. Antibiotics are often given. In small bowel obstruction about 25% require surgery. Complications may include sepsis, bowel ischemia and bowel perforation. In small bowel obstruction, the pain tends to be colicky in nature, with spasms lasting a few minutes. The pain tends to be central and mid-abdominal. Vomiting may occur before constipation. Common physical exam findings may include signs of dehydration, abdominal distension with tympany, nonspecific abdominal tenderness, and high pitched tinkly bowel sounds. In large bowel obstruction, the pain is felt lower in the abdomen and the spasms last longer. Common symptoms include abdominal pain, distension, and severe constipation.

Constipation occurs earlier and vomiting may be less prominent. Proximal obstruction of the large bowel may present as small bowel obstruction. Patients may notice a history of bloating and narrowing of stools before the onset of more severe symptoms. Causes Small bowel obstruction Causes of small bowel obstruction include:

- Adhesions from previous abdominal surgery
- Barbed sutures
- Pseudoobstruction
- Hernias containing bowel
- Crohn's disease causing adhesions or inflammatory strictures
- Neoplasms, benign or malignant
- Intussusception
- Volvulus
- Superior mesenteric artery syndrome, a compression of the duodenum by the superior mesenteric artery and the abdominal aorta.
- Ischemic strictures
- Foreign bodies
- Intestinal atresia
- Urinary retention After abdominal surgery, the incidence of small bowel obstruction from any cause is 9%.

In those where the cause of the obstruction was clear, adhesions are the single most common cause. The main diagnostic tools are blood tests, X-rays of the abdomen, CT scanning, and ultrasound. If a mass is identified, biopsy may determine the nature of the mass. Radiological signs of bowel obstruction include bowel distension and the presence of multiple air-fluid levels on supine and erect abdominal radiographs. Ultrasounds may be as useful as CT scanning to make the diagnosis. Contrast enema or small bowel series or CT scan can be used to define the level of obstruction, whether the obstruction is partial or complete, and to help define the cause of the obstruction. The appearance of water-soluble contrast in the cecum on an abdominal radiograph within 24 hours of it being given by mouth predicts resolution of an adhesive small bowel obstruction with sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 96%.

Colonoscopy, small bowel investigation with ingested camera or push endoscopy, and laparoscopy are other diagnostic options.
- - -. Treatment Treatment of small and large bowel obstructions are initially similar and non-operative management is usually the initial management strategy as the majority of small bowel obstruction resolve spontaneously with non-operative management. Patients are monitored by the surgical team for signs of improvement and resolution of the obstruction on imaging; if the obstruction does not clear then surgical management for the treatment of the causative lesion is required. In malignant large bowel obstruction, endoscopically placed self-expanding metal stents may be used to temporarily relieve the obstruction as a bridge to surgery, or as palliation.

Discussion

Adhesive SBO has a high recurrence rate and remains a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality that increases healthcare cost. Clinical guidelines are generally derived using two principal approaches: using evidence synthesized from prospective RCTs or using expert consensus groups that integrate physiology, existing data, and experience to craft recommendations. The WSES Bologna guidelines for adhesive SBO exemplify the latter, providing a pragmatic diagnostic and management framework. Bologna guideline adherence offers the potential to improve morbidity and mortality metrics, reduce healthcare resource utilization, and decrease recurrence of obstruction by promoting consistent and timely interventions. However, such opportunities rely on guideline adoption and utilization.

Other guidelines address patient-specific factors, rather than management approaches. Elderly patients with multi-morbidity, with or without frailty, benefit from individualized risk stratification and goals-of-care determinations that may direct early intervention, NOM, or comfort care. Of note, geriatric patient outcomes are not often comprehensively assessed, leaving occurrence rates uncertain. Despite care advances, gaps remain in ensuring goal-concordant care for elderly patients across the panoply of interventions for adhesive SBO. Evidence-informed — as opposed to evidence-based — recommendations, in concert with knowledge and process gaps, underscore the complexity of managing patients with adhesive SBO; surgeons must balance recommendations against individualized and patient-centred care.

Background

Adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) is a common surgical emergency, causing high morbidity and even some mortality. The adhesions causing such bowel obstructions are typically the footprints of previous abdominal surgical procedures. The present paper presents a revised version of the Bologna guidelines to evidence-based diagnosis and treatment of ASBO. The working group has added paragraphs on prevention of ASBO and special patient groups.

Methods

The guideline was written under the auspices of the World Society of Emergency Surgery by the ASBO working group. A systematic literature search was performed prior to the update of the guidelines to identify relevant new papers on epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of ASBO. Literature was critically appraised according to an evidence-based guideline development method. Final recommendations were approved by the workgroup, taking into account the level of evidence of the conclusion.

Recommendations

Adhesion formation might be reduced by minimally invasive surgical techniques and the use of adhesion barriers. Non-operative treatment is effective in most patients with ASBO. Contraindications for non-operative treatment include peritonitis, strangulation, and ischemia. When the adhesive etiology of obstruction is unsure, or when contraindications for non-operative management might be present, CT is the diagnostic technique of choice. The principles of non-operative treatment are nil per os, naso-gastric, or long-tube decompression, and intravenous supplementation with fluids and electrolytes. When operative treatment is required, a laparoscopic approach may be beneficial for selected cases of simple ASBO. Younger patients have a higher lifetime risk for recurrent ASBO and might therefore benefit from application of adhesion barriers as both primary and secondary prevention.

Discussion

This guideline presents recommendations that can be used by surgeons who treat patients with ASBO. Scientific evidence for some aspects of ASBO management is scarce, in particular aspects relating to special patient groups. Results of a randomized trial of laparoscopic versus open surgery for ASBO are awaited.

### Small bowel and colon perforation [^116NQDGF]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

For patients with small bowel and colonic perforations, a definitive diagnosis of the cause of perforation is not necessary before operation. Bowel obstruction and inflammatory bowel disease are the most common causes of nontraumatic intestinal perforations in industrialized countries, whereas infectious causes of intestinal perforations are more common in developing countries. Treatment of small bowel and colonic perforations generally includes intravenous antibiotics and fluid resuscitation, but the specific management of the bowel depends on the underlying cause of the perforation.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2013 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO working group [^113tZY9q]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

In 2013 Guidelines on diagnosis and management of ASBO have been revised and updated by the WSES Working Group on ASBO to develop current evidence-based algorithms and focus indications and safety of conservative treatment, timing of surgery and indications for laparoscopy.

Recommendations

In absence of signs of strangulation and history of persistent vomiting or combined CT-scan signs (free fluid, mesenteric edema, small-bowel feces sign, devascularization) patients with partial ASBO can be managed safely with NOM and tube decompression should be attempted. These patients are good candidates for Water-Soluble-Contrast-Medium (WSCM) with both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The radiologic appearance of WSCM in the colon within 24 hours from administration predicts resolution. WSCM maybe administered either orally or via NGT both immediately at admission or after failed conservative treatment for 48 hours. The use of WSCM is safe and reduces need for surgery, time to resolution and hospital stay.NOM, in absence of signs of strangulation or peritonitis, can be prolonged up to 72 hours. After 72 hours of NOM without resolution, surgery is recommended. Patients treated non-operatively have shorter hospital stay, but higher recurrence rate and shorter time to re-admission, although the risk of new surgically treated episodes of ASBO is unchanged. Risk factors for recurrences are age < 40 years and matted adhesions. WSCM does not decrease recurrence rates or recurrences needing surgery. Open surgery is often used for strangulating ASBO as well as after failed conservative management. In selected patients and with appropriate skills, laparoscopic approach is advisable using open access technique. Access in left upper quadrant or left flank is the safest and only completely obstructing adhesions should be identified and lysed with cold scissors. Laparoscopic adhesiolysis should be attempted preferably if first episode of SBO and/or anticipated single band. A low threshold for open conversion should be maintained. Peritoneal adhesions should be prevented. Hyaluronic acid-carboxycellulose membrane and icodextrin decrease incidence of adhesions. Icodextrin may reduce the risk of re-obstruction. HA cannot reduce need of surgery. Adhesions quantification and scoring maybe useful for achieving standardized assessment of adhesions severity and for further research in diagnosis and treatment of ASBO.

Notes on the use of the guidelines

The Guidelines are evidence-based, with the grade of recommendation also based on the evidence. The Guidelines present the diagnostic and therapeutic methods for optimal management and prevention of ASBO.

The practice Guidelines promulgated in this work do not represent a standard of practice. They are suggested plans of care, based on best available evidence and the consensus of experts, but they do not exclude other approaches as being within the standard of practice. For example, they should not be used to compel adherence to a given method of medical management, which method should be finally determined after taking account of the conditions at the relevant medical institution (staff levels, experience, equipment, etc.) and the characteristics of the individual patient. However, responsibility for the results of treatment rests with those who are directly engaged therein, and not with the consensus group.

Definition

Abdominal adhesions, which can begin forming within a few hours after an operation, represent the most common cause of intestinal obstruction being responsible for 60% to 70% of SBO. Adhesional postoperative small bowel obstruction is characterized by the presence of abdominal pain, vomiting, distention, and obstipation, in conjunction of confirmatory imaging.

### Small bowel obstruction [^113V7zqS]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on small bowel obstruction:

- **Definition**: SBO is a clinical syndrome characterized by symptoms related to mechanical blockage of the small bowel.
- **Pathophysiology**: Common etiologies include adhesions (65%), hernias (10%), neoplasms (5%), and Crohn's disease (5%).
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the incidence of SBO is approximately 100 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: The distension of small bowel segments that are proximal to the obstruction may lead to clinical manifestations of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Bacterial translocation can result in bacteremia. Progressive, untreated obstruction may lead to bowel ischemia and perforation, with secondary fecal peritonitis.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: In patients with SBO due to postoperative adhesions, in-hospital mortality is estimated at 4.7%. In patients undergoing emergency laparotomy for SBO, 1-month mortality is estimated at 7.2%.

Conservative treatment and timing for surgery

The management of ASBO is controversial because surgery can induce new adhesions, whereas conservative treatment does not remove the cause of the obstruction. Conservative treatment involves nasogastric intubation, intravenous fluid administration, and clinical observation. Strangulation of the bowel requires immediate surgery, but intestinal ischemia can be difficult to determine clinically.

Potentially, acute care surgery (ACS) model may adversely affect patients who present with SBO because they may be handed over from surgeon to surgeon without definitive care. These patients may not require an operation initially but may require one subsequently because of the development of complications or if the SBO does not resolve with conservative treatment.

In an Australian retrospective study Lien et al. observed that, in the ACS period, there was no significant difference in complication rates or length of hospital stay in those who were not handed over and those who were, both in the pre-ACS and ACS period.

The authors suggested that clinical handover may provide an 'audit-point' for patient management and opportunity for collaborative input. Moreover, participation of doctors with greater clinical experience may minimize errors in information transfer due to increased acumen in recognizing potential complications.

A delay in operation for SBO places patients at higher risk for bowel resection. In a retrospective review Leung and coll find that younger patients (P = 0.001), no previous operation (P < 0.001), and absence of adhesive disease (P < 0.001) were more likely to go to operation. Acquiring a CT scan (P = 0.029) or radiograph (P < 0.001) were factors that increased time to the operating room (OR). In the group with time to OR less than 24 hours, 12% of patients had bowel resection versus time to OR greater than 24 hours, 29% of them required bowel resection.

Several issues are raised when managing patients with ASBO.

Surgical technique

The main principles of prevention of adhesion and related complications are minimizing surgical trauma and the use of adjuvants to reduce adhesion formation. Laparoscopy is often believed to reduce adhesion formation and the risk for ASBO. In a systematic review of cohort studies, the incidence of reoperation for ASBO was 1.4 (95% CI 1.0–1.8%) after laparoscopic and 3.8% (95% CI 3.1–4.4%) after open surgery. However, there were differences in both the type and indications for surgery. In a recent meta-analysis of SBO after colorectal operations, the incidence of ASBO after laparoscopic surgery was somewhat lower than after open colorectal procedures (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.72). However, no significant difference was found in the three randomized trials included in this review (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.2). In summary, there is some evidence that the incidence of ASBO is lower after laparoscopy. However, the effect seems modest when correcting for type and indication of surgery. Thus, performing (colorectal) surgery by laparoscopy is not a complete solution to preventing adhesive SBO.

Many other aspects of surgical technique have been associated with adhesion formation, although there are little or no epidemiological data concerning their impact on the incidence of ASBO. Nevertheless, a number of important risk factors for aggravated adhesion formation are worth considering. One of the most important risk factors is the foreign body reaction, for example as seen with starch-powdered gloves, and meshes used for abdominal wall reconstruction. The choice of energy device might also impact adhesion formation. Peritoneal injury is lower in bipolar electrocautery and ultrasonic devices as compared to monopolar electrocautery. Animal data suggest that both systemic and intraperitoneal application of antibiotics, and metronidazole in particular, can reduce adhesion formation in septic conditions.

### Bowel obstruction and pseudo-obstruction [^114DCXjL]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

The gastroenterologist is frequently involved in the care of patients with bowel obstruction and pseudo-obstruction. In the case of obstruction, the central problem is determining which patients should be managed surgically. In both SBO and LBO, evidence of vascular compromise to the gut mandates surgical intervention. Most patients with pseudo-obstruction respond to conservative therapy or neostigmine. Endoscopic decompression is indicated in recalcitrant cases, with surgery reserved as a last resort.

Comparison between patients with and without small bowel resection during the index SBO episode management

Patients who underwent a small bowel resection during the index SBO episode had a similar rehospitalization rate and a nonsignificantly higher operation rate for small bowel obstruction recurrence, as well as similar overall mortality, compared to those who had no resection (Supplemental Table S3, online electronic supplementary material). Symptoms of SBO occurrence (considering patients who responded to follow-up evaluation) were similar between the two groups [35.0% (7/20) vs. 34.7% (17/49), OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.3–3.0; p = 0.981].

### Ascending cholangitis… [^113jA7rT]. Wikipedia (2024). Medium credibility.

Ascending cholangitis, also known as acute cholangitis or simply cholangitis, is inflammation of the bile duct, usually caused by bacteria ascending from its junction with the duodenum. It tends to occur if the bile duct is already partially obstructed by gallstones. Causes Bile duct obstruction, which is usually present in acute cholangitis, is generally due to gallstones. 10–30% of cases, however, are due to other causes such as benign stricturing, postoperative damage or an altered structure of the bile. Ascaris lumbricoides and the liver flukes Clonorchis sinensis, Opisthorchis viverrini and Opisthorchis felineus. In people with AIDS, a large number of opportunistic organisms has been known to cause AIDS cholangiopathy, but the risk has rapidly diminished since the introduction of effective AIDS treatment.

Cholangitis may also complicate medical procedures involving the bile duct, especially ERCP. To prevent this, it is recommended that those undergoing ERCP for any indication receive prophylactic antibiotics. The biliary tree is normally relatively free of bacteria because of certain protective mechanisms. The sphincter of Oddi acts as a mechanical barrier. The biliary system normally has low pressure and allows bile to flow freely through. The continuous forward flow of the bile in the duct flushes bacteria, if present, into the duodenum, and does not allow the establishment of an infection. The constitution of bile — bile salts and immunoglobulin secreted by the epithelium of the bile duct also has a protective role. 2O) resulting from obstruction in the bile duct widens spaces between the cells lining the duct, bringing bacterially contaminated bile in contact with the blood stream.

It also adversely affects the function of Kupffer cells, which are specialized macrophage cells that assist in preventing bacteria from entering the biliary system. Finally, increased biliary pressure decreases production of IgA immunoglobulins in the bile. This results in bacteremia and gives rise to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome comprising fever, tachycardia, increased respiratory rate and increased white blood cell count; SIRS in the presence of suspected or confirmed infection is called sepsis. Biliary obstruction itself disadvantages the immune system and impairs its capability to fight infection, by impairing the function of certain immune system cells and modifying the levels of immune hormones. In ascending cholangitis, it is assumed that organisms migrate backwards up the bile duct as a result of partial obstruction and decreased function of the sphincter of Oddi.

Other theories about the origin of the bacteria, such as through the portal vein or transmigration from the colon, are considered less likely. Blood cultures are often performed in people with fever and evidence of acute infection. These yield the bacteria causing the infection in 36% of cases, usually after 24–48 hours of incubation. Bile, too, may be sent for culture during ERCP. The most common bacteria linked to ascending cholangitis are gram-negative bacilli: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella and Enterobacter. Of the gram-positive cocci, Enterococcus causes 10–20%. Treatment Fluids and antibiotics Cholangitis requires admission to hospital. Intravenous fluids are administered, especially if the blood pressure is low, and antibiotics are commenced. Empirical treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics is usually necessary until it is known for certain which pathogen is causing the infection, and to which antibiotics it is sensitive.

Methods

The guideline was written under the auspices of the WSES by the ASBO working group. Systematic searches of the MEDLINE and Embase databases were carried out in October 2016 using the keywords relevant to each section. Terms relevant to each section of the guideline were mapped to MEDLINE Medical Subjects Headings (MeSH) terms, as well as searched for as text items. Articles describing randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews were searched for using the methodological filters of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. The bibliographies of included articles were subsequently hand-searched for other relevant references, and experts in the field were asked if they found any relevant reports missing.

Critical appraisal

Articles selected to support recommendations were assessed using the levels of evidence as published by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of the University of Oxford (Table 1). Articles were classified according to the type of article and individually assessed for methodological quality using the GRADE method as proposed by the GRADE working group. That working group has developed a common, sensible, and transparent approach to grading the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. The main literature on which the conclusion for each relevant topic is based is stated with the conclusion, accompanied by the level of evidence (Table 2).

Table 1
Classification of evidence per article

Table 2
Grading of the conclusions and recommendations according to the level of evidence and strength of recommendation

Conclusion and recommendations are graded according to the level of evidence from strong ("there is strong evidence for", level A) to weak ("we cannot be confident", level D). Recommendations were graded as strong recommendations (level I) or weak recommendation or suggestions (level II). Recommendations were considered strong recommendations if there is sufficient evidence (level A or B) demonstrating that the benefits of an intervention are of clinical importance and clearly outweigh the harm of the intervention. A concept guideline was sent to all involved for comment and approval after which internal consensus was reached between the members of the working group. Amendments were made based upon these comments, leading to the final version of this updated guideline.

Methods

- Consensus Development

In the Consensus Conference on July 2 nd 2010, the expert panel had two meetings and a further plenary session. The aim was to focus and clarify the diagnostic and therapeutic issues of the complex management of ASBO, leading to new clinical guidelines, updated and including a wide range of recommendations, for diagnosis, non operative management, timing for surgery, type of surgery and prevention strategies of peritoneal post-operative adhesions causing small bowel obstruction. Based on the review of the current literature, a panel of worldwide experts were invited to participate in the development of the new guidelines. All members of the expert panel were asked to define ASBO. For each step of diagnosis, treatment (conservative and surgical) and prevention of ASBO, one expert summarized the current state of the art. From the evidence based presentations and the reported statements as well as from the results of the relevant literature review, a preliminary document with the resume of the Consensus Statements and Recommendations was compiled. For every key statement, the discussion within the expert panel with the involvement of the audience, took place until a 100% consensus within the group and the audience was achieved. Comments from the audience were collected and partly included in the manuscript. In September 2010 the expert panel had further contacts for discussing and finalize the final version of the text of the guidelines recommendations. The final version of the guidelines was approved by all experts in the panel as well as the experts from the audience who played an active role in the discussion during the Consensus Conference. Each "chapter" consists of a key statement with a grade of recommendation (GoR) followed by a commentary to explain the rationale and evidence behind the statement.

- Literature Searches and Appraisal

We have used the Oxford hierarchy for grading clinical studies according to levels of evidence. Literature searches were aimed at finding randomized (i.e. level 1b evidence) or nonrandomized controlled clinical trials (i.e. level 2b evidence). Alternatively, low-level evidence (mainly case series and case reports; i.e. level 4 evidence) was reviewed. Studies containing severe methodological flaws were downgraded. For each intervention, we considered the validity and homogeneity of study results, effect sizes, safety, and economic consequences.

Systematic literature searches were conducted on Medline and the Cochrane Library until December 2010. There were no restrictions regarding the language of publication. We also paid attention to studies that were referenced in systematic reviews or previous guidelines.

### A rare cause of partial small bowel obstruction [^116aiziC]. Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

A 59-year-old man presented with a five-month history of recurrent abdominal pain and vomiting. Five months prior to admission, during an episode of abdominal pain, an abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed segmental wall thickening and blurring of the small bowel wall in the right mid-abdomen, with obscuration of the adjacent mesenteric fat planes. Mild upstream small bowel dilatation with fecalized content and mural blurring suggested partial small bowel obstruction (Fig. 1). He was managed conservatively at a local hospital with fasting, intravenous fluids, and antibiotic therapy, which resulted in symptomatic improvement. However, he subsequently experienced two milder episodes of abdominal pain, neither of which received a medical evaluation.

Fig. 1
The computed tomography imaging manifestations suggest incomplete intestinal obstruction.

On admission, a physical examination revealed a soft, non-distended, and non-tender abdomen. Laboratory investigations revealed a normal white blood cell count (6.87 × 10⁹/L) with mild eosinophilia (14.3%). No abnormalities were found in other blood biochemical tests. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a nonspecific gastroduodenal inflammation. Random colonoscopic biopsy results were unremarkable. During oral double-balloon enteroscopy, advancement to approximately 300 cm into the ileum revealed a segment of markedly edematous and hyperemic small-bowel mucosa (Fig. 2 a). An actively motile live worm surrounded by congested and edematous mucosa with mild hemorrhage was observed penetrating the intestinal mucosa (Fig. 2 b). The helminth was successfully extracted using the biopsy forceps (Fig. 2 c, Video 1). Histopathological analysis confirmed that the specimen was Enterobius vermicularis (Fig. 3 a–c). Based on this, the patient was clearly diagnosed with partial small bowel obstruction caused by enterobiasis of the small intestine. The patient underwent a course of albendazole, an anthelmintic agent effective against Enterobius vermicularis. Following antiparasitic therapy, the patient achieved complete resolution of symptoms, with no further episodes of abdominal pain or vomiting.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2010 evidence-based guidelines of the World Society of Emergency Surgery [^115MM5Fd]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Fevang et al. found that among 146 patients with SBO initially treated conservatively, 93 (64%) settled without operation, 9 (6%) had strangulated bowel and 3 (2%) died. Whereas of the 91 patients with partial obstruction but no sign of strangulation, 72 (79%) resolved on conservative treatment. Therefore the authors recommended that patients with partial obstruction and no sign of strangulation should initially be treated conservatively. Furthermore when complete obstruction is present, it may settle on conservative management, but the use of supplementary diagnostic tools might be desirable to find the patients who will need early operative treatment.

In another review, out of 329 patients with SBO 43% were successfully treated conservatively, whereas 57% failed conservative treatment and underwent surgery. Overall, there were eight early deaths, four in each group (2.8% conservative vs. 2.1% surgical; p = ns). Out of these patients presenting with SBO, 63% had abdominal surgery and 37% had no prior abdominal surgery before developing a small bowel obstruction.

In conclusion, the most recent meta-analyses showed that the patients who had surgery within the six weeks before the episode of small bowel obstruction, patients with signs of strangulation or peritonitis (fever, tachycardia and leucocytosis), patients with carcinomatosis, patients with irreducible hernia and patients who started to have signs of resolution at the time of admission are not candidate for conservative treatment ± Water Soluble Contrast Medium administration.

Also the EAST guidelines on SBO management recommend that the patients with plain film finding of small bowel obstruction and Clinical markers (fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia, metabolic acidosis and continuous pain) or peritonitis on physical exam warrant exploration.

### Small bowel obstruction: what a gastroenterologist needs to know [^113PG3fg]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Intrabdominal adhesions and intestinal hernias are the commonest cause of small bowel obstruction. Small bowel diseases, which cause small bowel obstruction, are rarer and often poses a challenge to gastroenterologists to diagnose and treat. In this review, small bowel diseases, which predispose to small bowel obstruction, are focused on, and their challenges in diagnosis and treatment.

Recent Findings

Diagnosis of causes of partial small bowel obstruction is improved with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) enterography. In fibrostenotic Crohn's strictures and NSAID diaphragm disease, endoscopic balloon dilatation can delay the need for surgery if the lesion is short and accessible; however, many may still inevitably require surgery. Biologic therapy may reduce the need for surgery in symptomatic small bowel Crohn's disease wherein the strictures are predominantly inflammatory. In chronic radiation enteropathy, only refractory small bowel obstruction and those with nutritional difficulties warrant surgery.

Summary

Small bowel diseases causing bowel obstruction are often challenging to diagnose and require numerous investigations over a period of time, which often culminate with surgery. Use of biologics and endoscopic balloon dilatation can help to delay and prevent surgery in some instances.

### Small bowel obstruction outcomes according to compliance with the World Society of Emergency Surgery bologna guidelines [^112nJBpB]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common cause of surgical admission and is associated with significant morbidity, healthcare cost, and resource utilization. Adhesions are the most common aetiology in high-income settings, whereas malignancy and hernia are more globally represented. Despite diagnostic, therapeutic, and technical advances, patients continue to face delayed symptom resolution, high complication rates, and frequent recurrence of obstruction.

Evidence-informed expert consensus guidelines aim to reduce practice variability, enhance treatment effectiveness, and improve clinical and patient-reported outcomes. The World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) Bologna guidelines offer recommendations encompassing diagnosis, non-operative management (NOM), surgery, and postoperative care for patients with adhesive SBO. See Table 1.

Table 1
Summary of key recommendations from the WSES Bologna guidelines (2017 update) for the management of adhesive SBO

Resource limitations, regional healthcare delivery differences, and competing clinical priorities may hinder guideline adoption. While deviations from guideline-based care may contribute to population-level outcome disparities, the causes and effects of non-compliance for an individual patient remain poorly characterized. Furthermore, evaluating concordance with guideline-informed care helps shape future guideline development to detail new knowledge, highlight evidence-to-practice gaps, identify implementation barriers, and refine deployment strategies that improve adoption and utilization.

Prospective, multicentre, time-bound observational studies, termed snapshot audits, are well suited to assess guideline adherence in heterogeneous real-world environments, identifying specific evidence-to-practice gaps and barriers to implementation. This study, SnapSBO, examines whether and how full or partial guideline compliance influences patient outcomes, including complications and hospital length of stay (LOS).

### Small bowel diverticular disease: are we clinically aware? [^116TrEnR]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients and methods

The inpatient hospital database of two tertiary referral centers, from January 2006 through December 2022 was retrospectively screened to identify all patients with small bowel diverticular disease. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Patients diagnosed with small bowel diverticula (SBD), located in the duodenum, ileum or jejunum, (2) Patients with available clinical data, including clinical presentation, diagnostic methods, and subsequent treatment. Patients with incomplete clinical or radiological data were excluded from the study analysis. Eligible patients were categorized into three subgroups based on the anatomical location of the diverticula (duodenal, jejunal, or ileal) to enable comparative analyses of clinical features and management strategies. Relevant clinical and radiological data were obtained for study analysis. Clinical data included clinical presentation of the patient upon admission, which can be classified into the following symptom groups: asymptomatic or incidental finding, pain or discomfort, bleeding, fever, obstruction, and acute abdomen. The patient history and hospital logs were meticulously screened to ensure that the chief complaint reported by the patient was associated with small bowel diverticular (SBD) disease. Patients were classified as asymptomatic if they had no clinical manifestations directly attributable to SBD (e.g. abdominal pain, bleeding, obstruction, or perforation) and no complications observed on imaging or endoscopic evaluation. Symptom relevance was determined through a multidisciplinary review involving gastroenterologists and radiologists, who assessed the temporal and anatomical correlation between reported symptoms and SBD findings. The location and number of diverticula were also recorded. Diagnostic methods used to identify the SBD, included radiological, endoscopic, or intraoperative diagnosis. Radiological diagnosis can be further divided into barium follow-through (BaFT) with X-ray or abdominal computer tomography (CT). While, endoscopic diagnosis was achieved by gastroscopy or duodenoscopy, double balloon enteroscopy (DBE), video capsule endoscopy (VCE) or in combination. All imaging and endoscopic findings were independently reviewed by two radiologists and two gastroenterologists to ensure diagnostic consistency. If more than one diagnostic approach was used, the specific modalities were documented. Treatment received were subsequently collected and can be divided into conservative therapy or surgical intervention. Conservative therapy included dietary modifications (low-residue diet), antibiotics for bacterial overgrowth, and analgesics for pain management. Any treatment associated complication were also detailed.

### Association between antibiotic use and primary idiopathic intussusception… [^113nw8Rr]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

Antibiotic use within 48 hours of diagnosis was found in 23 cases and 33 controls. Antibiotic use among US children according to NHANES III was 10. 7%. In cases, the β-lactam class accounted for 78% of all medications used. Cephalosporin use was associated with more than a 20-fold increased risk of intussusception. Conclusion An association between antibiotic drug use and intussusception was identified. INTUSSUSCEPTION IS the most common cause of intestinal obstruction in children aged 3 months to 6 years. 1 John Hunter2 first described intestinal invagination in the 18th century; however, the exact mechanism is still poorly defined in this age group, and the etiology is suspected to be multifactorial.

Promotility medications and certain chemical substances such as cocaine, laxatives, and organophosphates have been identified as potential agents that may contribute to the development of intussusception. 4–6 Inflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide, prostaglandins, and cytokines have been demonstrated to increase rates of intussusception by altering gut motility in laboratory mice. 7 Antibiotics, the second most widely prescribed medication class in the United States, 8 modify gut motility and intestinal flora. 9 To our knowledge, no studies to date have implicated antibiotics as a potential cause of intussusception. A total of 60 antibiotics were used by 23 cases and 33 controls. Amoxicillin was the most commonly used medication, followed by ceftriaxone sodium and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

Ranitidine, promethazine hydrochloride, cisapride, aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide and simethicone, and simethicone were the most common GI medications listed from a total of 11 GI medications identified. Antipyretics and analgesics, asthma medications, over-the-counter cold and cough medicines, and seizure medications all had ORs that were lowered after adjustment and that were not statistically significant. Most antibiotic use for cases and controls was recorded as occurring at the time of ED presentation. Each group had 2 patients not currently taking antibiotics, having discontinued using these medications within 48 hours of ED visitation. Therefore, neither group had discontinued any listed antibiotics more than 48 hours before ED presentation.

The association between antibiotic use and intussusception varied little regarding indication, with similar ORs for otitis media, upper respiratory tract infection, and other indications. Other indications listed were fever, urinary tract reflux, postlaceration repair, sickle cell prophylaxis, and stomach virus. For the group of children younger than 4 years presenting to the ED with primary idiopathic intussusception, the risk attributable to antibiotic use was 18. 7%. This estimate was based on a RR of 4. 15 and a proportion of antibiotic users of 0.
247. From NHANES III, antibiotic use among American children during the 2 weeks before interview was approximately 10. 7%, which is similar to that of the study control group. Use of β-lactam antibiotics from the NHANES III external analysis was 8. 3%. Therefore, use of antibiotics in our series of intussusception cases was 2.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2013 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO working group [^113qPxV4]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background of WSES guidelines

Adhesive small bowel obstruction requires appropriate management with a proper diagnostic and therapeutic pathway. Indication and length of Non Operative treatment and appropriate timing for surgery may represent an insidious issue.

Delay in surgical treatment may cause a substantial increase of morbidity and mortality. However repeated laparotomy and adhesiolysis may worsen the process of adhesion formation and their severity. Furthermore the introduction and widespread of laparoscopy has raised the question of selection of appropriate patients with ASBO good candidate for laparoscopic approach. On the other hand, several adjuncts for improving the success rate of NOM and clarifying indications and timing for surgery are currently available, such as hyperosmolar water soluble contrast medium.

No consensus has been reached in diagnosing and managing the patients with ASBO and specific and updated guidelines are lacking.

We carried out an extensive review of the English-language literature and found that there was little high-level evidence in this field, and no systematically described practical manual for the field. Most importantly, there are no standardized diagnostic criteria and therapeutic management guidelines for ASBO, therefore, we would like to establish standards for these items. The Bologna Guidelines include evidence-based medicine and reflect the international consensus obtained through earnest discussions among professionals in the field on 1–3 July, 2010, at the Belmeloro Convention Center, Bologna, Italy.

We aimed to validate and refine the first version of the guidelines, hypothesizing that a model, incorporated in a treatment algorithm, would be predictive, would prevent delayed management of strangulation and would be successfully improved.

Therefore in 2013 the guidelines have been revised and updated by the WSES Working Group on ASBO with the development of diagnosis and treatment evidence-based algorithms (Figure 1, Figure 2).

Figure 1
Evidence-based Algorithm for Diagnosis and Assessment of ASBO.

Figure 2
Evidence-based Algorithm for Management and Treatment of ASBO.

Furthermore a customary management can help to standardize care throughout a district, a region, or a state satisfying the corporate governance requirements of "clinical efficacy" and "economic efficiency" with the results of improved outcomes and decreased costs.

Improvement of performance is a mainstay of any practice management guideline.

### 2017 WSES guidelines on colon and rectal cancer emergencies: obstruction and perforation [^112kr6Ks]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

ᅟ

Obstruction and perforation due to colorectal cancer represent challenging matters in terms of diagnosis, life-saving strategies, obstruction resolution and oncologic challenge. The aims of the current paper are to update the previous WSES guidelines for the management of large bowel perforation and obstructive left colon carcinoma (OLCC) and to develop new guidelines on obstructive right colon carcinoma (ORCC).

Methods

The literature was extensively queried for focused publication until December 2017. Precise analysis and grading of the literature has been performed by a working group formed by a pool of experts: the statements and literature review were presented, discussed and voted at the Consensus Conference of the 4th Congress of the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) held in Campinas in May 2017.

Results

CT scan is the best imaging technique to evaluate large bowel obstruction and perforation. For OLCC, self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS), when available, offers interesting advantages as compared to emergency surgery; however, the positioning of SEMS for surgically treatable causes carries some long-term oncologic disadvantages, which are still under analysis. In the context of emergency surgery, resection and primary anastomosis (RPA) is preferable to Hartmann's procedure, whenever the characteristics of the patient and the surgeon are permissive. Right-sided loop colostomy is preferable in rectal cancer, when preoperative therapies are predicted. With regards to the treatment of ORCC, right colectomy represents the procedure of choice; alternatives, such as internal bypass and loop ileostomy, are of limited value. Clinical scenarios in the case of perforation might be dramatic, especially in case of free faecal peritonitis. The importance of an appropriate balance between life-saving surgical procedures and respect of oncologic caveats must be stressed. In selected cases, a damage control approach may be required. Medical treatments including appropriate fluid resuscitation, early antibiotic treatment and management of co-existing medical conditions according to international guidelines must be delivered to all patients at presentation.

Conclusions

The current guidelines offer an extensive overview of available evidence and a qualitative consensus regarding management of large bowel obstruction and perforation due to colorectal cancer.

### SBO ACTION: conservative small bowel obstruction management in the absence of standard conTrast agents ON outcomes [^116bJgr2]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Conservative Small Bowel Obstruction management in the Absence of standard ConTrast agents ON outcomes (SBO ACTION) was a national, multicentre, prospective cohort study conducted in the UK from 1 April to 1 July 2024. This study is reported in accordance with the STROBE statement.

As SBO ACTION was a combined audit and service evaluation, ethical approval was not required. Each participating site secured local audit and Caldicott Guardian permissions to participate and were not permitted to collect data without confirmation of approvals.

Study setting

Eligible sites included any National Health Service (NHS) hospital in the UK providing emergency surgical services. Each participating hospital had a local principal investigator, responsible for coordinating and organizing local teams, and up to three local collaborators. Roles are detailed under the heading 'SBO ACTION Collaborative', in line with the guidelines for authorship in collaborative research. To ensure consistency in data collection and management, all participating centres received standardized training via an online presentation delivered by the study steering committee. However, contrast administration protocols were not strictly standardized across sites, as this study aimed to capture real-world variation in practice.

Study population

Consecutive adult patients (aged ≥ 16 years) referred to emergency surgical services with a working diagnosis of SBO were screened for inclusion. Patients were included if they had a positive CT confirming aSBO with the intention to manage conservatively for at least 24 h, as determined by a specialist surgeon (ST3+).

Cases with prior abdominal surgery in the same admission, non-adhesional SBO, pregnant women, those < 16 years old, and those with a hospital length of stay < 24 h were excluded.

### Small bowel obstruction: a practical step-by-step evidence-based approach to evaluation, decision making, and management [^116ks8Ue]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The initial goal of evaluating a patient with SBO is to immediately identify strangulation and need for urgent operative intervention, concurrent with rapid resuscitation. This relies on a combination of traditional clinical signs and CT findings. In patients without signs of strangulation, a protocol for administration of Gastrografin immediately in the emergency department efficiently sorts patients into those who will resolve their obstructions and those who will fail nonoperative management. Furthermore, because of the unique ability of Gastrografin to draw water into the bowel lumen, it expedites resolution of partial obstructions, shortening time to removal of nasogastric tube liberalization of diet, and discharge from the hospital. Implementation of such a protocol is a complex, multidisciplinary, and time-consuming endeavor. As such, we cannot over emphasize the importance of clear, open communication with everyone involved. If surgical management is warranted, we encourage an initial laparoscopic approach with open access. Even if this results in immediate conversion to laparotomy after assessment of the intra-abdominal status, we encourage this approach with a goal of 30% conversion rate or higher. This will attest that patients will have been given the highest likelihood of a successful laparoscopic LOA.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2013 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO working group [^116ws9Fc]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Initial evaluation

After an accurate physical examination and the evaluation of WBC, Lactate, Electrolytes, BUN/Creat; first step of diagnostic work up for ASBO is supine and erect plain abdominal X-ray which can show multiple air-fluid levels, distension of small bowel loops and the absence of gas in the colonic section.

All patients being evaluated for small bowel obstruction should have plain films (Level of Evidence 2b GoR C).

Secondary evaluation

CT scan is highly diagnostic in SBO and has a great value in all patients with inconclusive plain films for complete or high grade SBO. However CT-scans should not be routinely performed in the decision-making process except when clinical history, physical examination, and plain film are not conclusive for small bowel obstruction diagnosis (Level of Evidence 2b GoR B).

CT scan often allows to confirm the presence of complete obstruction, to reach the diagnosis of the cause of SBO, it also exclude a non-adhesional pathology and assess the occurrence of strangulation with a sensitivity and specificity higher than 90% and a NPV of nearly 100%.

The association of CT scan signs of bowel ischemia should lead a low threshold for surgical intervention (Level of Evidence 2a GoR B).

Ultrasound has a limited value in bowel obstruction or in patients with distended bowel, because the air may obscure the underlying findings. Usual US findings are: distention, peristalsis (differential diagnosis of ileus vs. mechanical SBO), differences in mucosal folds around transition point, free fluid (sign of ischemia).

MRI use should be restricted to those patients having CT or iodine contrast contraindications (Level of Evidence 2c GoR C).

Water-soluble contrast follow-through is valuable in patients undergoing initial non operative conservative management in order to rule out complete ASBO and predict the need for surgery (Level of Evidence 1b GoR A). Water-soluble contrast administration has both diagnostic and therapeutic value.

This investigation is safer than barium in cases of perforation and peritoneal spread and has possible therapeutic value in the case of adhesive small intestine obstruction.

2146. doi:
10. 1001/jama.
2018. 5834 A small bowel obstruction is a blockage in the small intestine. Small bowel obstructions are usually caused by scar tissue, hernia, or cancer. In the United States, most obstructions occur as a result of prior surgeries. The bowel often forms bands of scar after being handled during an operation. The more surgeries that involve the bowel, the more scars are likely to form. If the bowel becomes trapped in adhesions, it may lead to a small bowel obstruction. In severe cases, the blood supply might be compromised, and the bowel tissues might die. This is a life-threatening situation. The small bowel constantly moves digested food and stomach juices forward from the stomach to the colon. A small bowel obstruction caused by adhesions may occur as early as a few weeks and as late as several years after a surgery without any obvious inciting event.

An obstruction can cause the material inside the bowel to back up into the stomach. This causes nausea and vomiting of dark green bile. The bowel preceding the obstruction becomes large, dilated, and filled with the fluid and air that would otherwise move forward. This causes bloating. When the bowel squeezes to push things forward past the obstruction, it causes cramping and discomfort. If fluid and air cannot advance beyond the obstruction, patients can no longer pass gas or have a bowel movement. A history of surgeries, hernia, or cancer is important to know about. A doctor's examination accompanied by blood tests and an x-ray or computed tomography scan can confirm the diagnosis. Most obstructions resolve by allowing the small bowel to rest and shrink back to its normal size, thus making the adhesions less problematic.

This is accomplished by inserting a nasogastric tube that suctions fluid from the stomach. In addition, patients are not allowed to eat or drink during this time and are instead given intravenous fluids for hydration. Usually, a small bowel obstruction resolves after a few days. When a patient becomes less bloated, starts to pass gas, and has a bowel movement, the tube is removed and the patient is allowed to eat and drink. If the patient is not better, then operative intervention may be necessary. The surgery is called lysis of adhesions, which means cutting the scar tissue and freeing up the trapped bowel. If any part of the bowel looks unhealthy or dead, it will be cut out and the healthy ends will be sewn back together. Any hernia can also entrap the bowel and cause similar symptoms.

A hernia can typically be detected during a doctor's examination; in some cases imaging may be needed to ensure that a hernia is not the cause of the obstruction. Severe pain or fever may be a sign that the bowel is not receiving enough blood or may be dead. Patients without any history of bowel surgery or without a hernia found on examination should undergo a CT scan to exclude cancer as a possible cause of the obstruction.

### Can small bowel obstruction during pregnancy be treated with conservative management? A review [^114b8KwQ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

SBIO during pregnancy is a relatively rare condition with dire consequences if missed. With medical advancements, there should be no reason for missed diagnosis, and early intervention should be provided to prevent maternal and foetal mortality and morbidity. After diagnosing the underlying cause of SBIO and ruling out bowel ischaemia or closed-loop obstruction, it is worth attempting conservative management to avoid morbidity from surgical intervention. This is best done with appropriate close monitoring of both the mother and foetus, considering the commencement of TPN to prevent complications of malnourishment until the SBIO is resolved.

### A core outcome set for clinical studies of adhesive small bowel obstruction [^111xi2Br]. Colorectal Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a very common emergency surgical condition; obstruction is the indication for surgery in just under half of the 25 000 patients undergoing emergency laparotomy in the UK. SBO is the cause of death in 3.5 people per 100 000 population each year in high income countries and 1.8 deaths per 100 000 population in low and middle income countries. The commonest cause of mechanical SBO is adhesions, usually from previous abdominal surgery, accounting for around 50% of all cases. Postoperative adhesions may affect up to 3.5% of patients by 20 years. Adhesive SBO (ASBO) typically manifests with cramping abdominal pain, abdominal distension, intolerance to enteral intake and bilious vomiting. Patients are at risk of dehydration, renal failure, infection including aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition and poor wound healing. One third of cases of ASBO require treatment with surgical intervention; the remaining cases settle with supportive management only. Morbidity and mortality following treatment remains significant with reported mortality of 7.2% at 90 days post surgery.

The quality of randomised data and outcomes reporting in ASBO is limited. The most recent trials in ASBO focus on the use of water soluble contrast agents, or laparoscopic surgery. Given the challenges of delivering research in this area, it is important to maximise the utility of studies to support the literature. As studies focus on interventions in different parts of the patient pathway, the outcomes selected for reporting may differ, meaning that some key outcome data is not addressed. A systematic review of outcomes reported in trials and observational studies of ASBO identified 45 different outcome measures used across 51 studies. Such variation in reporting of outcomes results in difficulties comparing results between studies and in implementation of research findings into clinical practice.

One approach to reducing variation in practice is to develop a "Core Outcome Set" (COS). A core outcome set is an agreed, standardised set of outcomes that should be measured, as a minimum, in all studies in a particular health area. A COS is not intended to be restrictive as additional outcomes may be reported. Ensuring consistency in reported outcomes is important as thorough outcome reporting might avoid issues such as reporting bias, maximise information from each study, and reduce heterogeneity in subsequent meta‐analysis.

The aim of this study was to develop a COS for use in studies reporting outcomes of adult patients undergoing treatment for adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO).

### Small bowel obstruction: what to look for… [^112EdT5A]. Radiographics (2009). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common clinical syndrome for which effective treatment depends on a rapid and accurate diagnosis. Despite advances in imaging and a better understanding of small bowel pathophysiology, SBO is often diagnosed late or misdiagnosed, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. A comprehensive approach that includes clinical findings, patient history, and triage examinations such as plain abdominal radiography will help the clinician develop an individualized treatment plan. When an SBO is accompanied by signs of strangulation, emergent surgical treatment is advised. If surgery cannot be performed immediately or if a partial obstruction is suspected, then a more detailed radiologic work-up is needed. The imaging techniques used subsequently vary according to the initial findings. If a low-grade partial obstruction is suspected, volume-challenge enteral examinations such as enteroclysis and computed tomographic (CT) enteroclysis are preferred. If a complete or high-grade obstruction is suspected, cross-sectional studies such as ultrasonography or multidetector CT are used to exclude strangulation. An algorithmic approach to imaging is proposed for the management of SBO to achieve accurate diagnosis of the obstruction; determine its severity, site, and cause; and assess the presence of strangulation. Radiologists have a pivotal role in clinical decision making in cases of SBO by providing answers to specific questions that significantly affect management.

### British society of gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^115KY9QD]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

4.7.1 Medical therapy for strictures

Good Practice Recommendation 8. Patients with stricturing small bowel Crohn's disease should have joint medical and surgical assessment to optimise medical therapy and plan requirement for surgical resection or strictureplasty (Agreement: 100%).

The CREOLE study evaluated 97 Crohn's disease patients with symptomatic small bowel strictures and assessed response to adalimumab treatment. Treatment was successful at week 24 in 64% of patients, and a prognostic score at baseline was constructed. This included clinical features (use of immunosuppressive drugs at baseline, obstructive symptoms, severity and duration, and MRE features (length of stricture < 12 cm, an intermediate proximal small bowel dilatation (18–29 mm), marked enhancement on delayed T1-weighted sequence and absence of fistula). A higher score was associated with greater likelihood of response to therapy. The authors emphasised the complexity of assessing inflammation and stricturing, which nearly always occur together, and the value of both clinical and MRI features in deciding the value of using drug therapy rather than surgery for small bowel strictures.

Small bowel bacterial overgrowth is common in small bowel Crohn's disease, particularly in areas above strictures, and responds to broad-spectrum antibiotics(for further detail see the Section on 4.10.1.2.2 Post-surgical management of Crohn's disease: Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth). For nutritional advice for patients with strictures see box 8.

4.7.2 Surgical therapy for strictures

Rates of surgery for Crohn's disease appear to be declining. Patient selection and outcomes in stricturing disease can be optimised by careful assessment of fibrotic burdenas well as due consideration of alternatives including endoscopic therapy, and decisions are best taken with joint input from all MDT members. As discussed above, a prognostic score based on MRE features and clinical factors can help in predicting the likely response to anti-TNF therapy. A moderate degree of dilatation proximal to the stricture is associated with greater likelihood of response than either massive dilatation or, rather surprisingly, no dilatation. Having more marked obstructive symptoms, but with a shorter duration, is also associated with success of anti-TNF therapy.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2010 evidence-based guidelines of the World Society of Emergency Surgery [^1117Dxrt]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

In another recently developed model for predicting the risk of strangulated SBO, six variables correlated with small bowel resection: history of pain lasting 4 days or more, guarding, C-reactive protein level at least 75 mg/l, leucocyte count 10 × 10⁹/L or greater, free intraperitoneal fluid volume at least 500 mL on computed tomography (CT) and reduction of CT small bowel wall contrast enhancement.

A further multivariate predictive model of surgical operation in SBO, showed free intraperitoneal fluid, mesenteric edema, lack of the "small bowel feces sign" at CT, and history of vomiting to be significant predictors of the need for operative exploration.

In a retrospective study of 53 patients with ASBO treated using a long nasointestinal tube (LT), complete SBO (no evidence of air within the large bowel) and increased serum creatine phosphokinase (≥ 130 IU/L) were independent predictive factors for LT decompression failure.

A recent prospective study aimed to evaluate an algorithm using CT-scans and Gastrografin in the management of small bowel obstruction, severe abdominal pain (VAS > 4), abdominal guarding, raised WCC and devascularized bowel at CT predict the need for emergent laparotomy at the time of admission. Furthermore this study demonstrated the diagnostic role of Gastrografin in discriminating between partial and complete small bowel obstruction whilst CT-scans were disappointing in their ability to predict the necessity of emergent laparotomies.

Again two systematic reviews confirmed the value of water soluble contrast medium in predicting need for surgery in ASBO patients.

Abbas et al. in 2007 already confirmed that Water-soluble contrast followed by an abdominal radiograph after at least 4 hours can accurately predict the likelihood of resolution of a small bowel obstruction and that appearance of water-soluble contrast agent in the colon on an abdominal radiograph within 24 h of its administration predicted resolution of obstruction with a pooled sensitivity of 97 per cent and specificity of 96 per cent.

Branco et al. as well found that the appearance of WS contrast in the colon within 4–24 h after administration accurately predicts resolution of ASBO with a sensitivity of 96 per cent and specificity of 98 per cent.

In conclusion patients without the above mentioned clinical picture (including all signs of strangulation and/orperitonitis etc.) and a partial SBO or a complete SBO can both undergo non-operative management safely; although, complete obstruction has a higher level of failure.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2010 evidence-based guidelines of the World Society of Emergency Surgery [^111nMFGm]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

ASBO is a common disease. Non operative management should be attempted in absence of signs of peritonitis or strangulation. WSCM is safe and has a definite role in diagnosis (for predicting the resolution or need for surgery) and therapy (for reducing the operative rate and shortening time to resolution of symptoms and hospital stay). Open surgery remains the safest and most effective operative approach. Prevention with hyaluronic acid-carboxycellulose membrane or icodextrin, has actually a capital relevance.

### Diagnosis and management of small bowel obstruction in virgin abdomen: a WSES position paper [^111U77pC]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common surgical emergency, causing high morbidity and healthcare costs. The majority of SBOs are caused by adhesions that result from previous surgeries. Bowel obstruction, however, also occurs in patients without previous operation or known pathology, a so called virgin abdomen. It is unknown if small bowel obstruction in the virgin abdomen (SBO-VA) can be managed according to the same principles as other cases of small bowel obstruction. The aim of this position paper is to evaluate the available evidence on etiology and management of small bowel obstruction in the virgin abdomen.

Methods

This is a narrative review with scoping aspects. Clinical topics covered in this review include epidemiology and etiology of SBO-VA, diagnosis and imaging, initial assessment, the role of surgical management in SBO-VA, and the role of non-operative management in SBO-VA.

Results

Our scoping search revealed seven original studies reporting original patient data related to SBO-VA. All the included studies are retrospective cohorts, with populations ranging between 44 and 103 patients with SBO-VA. Adhesions were found to be the cause of the obstruction in approximately half of the reported cases of SBO-VA. A relatively high number of cases of SBO-VA were managed surgically with studies reporting 39–83%. However, in cases where a trial of non-operative management was started, this was generally successful.

Conclusion

The data available suggest that etiology and treatment results for patients with SBO-VA are largely comparable to the results in patients with SBO after previous abdominal surgery. We therefore propose that patients with a virgin abdomen could be treated according to existing guidelines for SBO and adhesive small bowel obstruction.
