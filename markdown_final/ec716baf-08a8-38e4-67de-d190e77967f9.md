## Question

Mechanism of bradycardia in hypothyroidism

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the mechanism of bradycardia in hypothyroidism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether bradycardia in hypothyroidism is a recognized, reversible phenomenon. Then, I should verify the direct cardiac effects of thyroid hormone deficiency, including ion channel and contractile protein changes. Next, I will examine autonomic nervous system alterations and their contribution to heart rate. After that, I need to consider structural and histologic changes in the conduction system that could impair impulse generation and propagation. Finally, I will integrate these mechanisms, note exceptions and special populations, and confirm the clinical implications for reversibility with thyroid hormone replacement therapy.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Bradycardia is a classic cardiovascular manifestation of hypothyroidism and is repeatedly emphasized as a reversible cause of sinus node dysfunction in major guidelines, which recommend identifying and treating reversible contributors such as hypothyroidism before considering permanent pacing, underscoring both the mechanism's clinical relevance and its potential for correction with thyroxine therapy [^5f70546d] [^00fc3766] [^4ac6f3f8].

> I will now examine the direct cardiac effects of thyroid hormone deficiency. Thyroid hormone, particularly T3, upregulates genes encoding pacemaker channels (HCN2/HCN4), calcium-handling proteins (SERCA2, RyR2), and contractile elements, while downregulating negative regulators like phospholamban. In hypothyroidism, these programs are blunted, reducing sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium cycling, slowing diastolic depolarization, and decreasing contractility, which collectively contribute to bradycardia and low cardiac output [^a8ebbf71] [^ee373a52] [^b3ea8160].

> Wait, let me verify the role of autonomic modulation. I initially thought hypothyroidism might increase vagal tone to explain bradycardia, but I should double-check that. Evidence suggests hypothyroidism is associated with sympathovagal imbalance with relative sympathetic withdrawal rather than vagal dominance, and heart rate variability studies show reduced autonomic adaptability in both hypo- and hyperthyroidism, indicating impaired autonomic modulation rather than a simple vagal excess explanation for bradycardia [^26e7a3bb] [^74e41a55].

> Next, I should review structural and histologic changes in the conduction system. In severe, longstanding hypothyroidism, myxedema causes interstitial edema, mucopolysaccharide deposition, and fibrosis around the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, which can compress and impair impulse generation and propagation; these changes are reversible with thyroid hormone replacement, explaining the dramatic improvement in conduction after treatment in case reports and clinical experience [^37c6cdd3] [^6044b9a4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universality. I need to check exceptions. In neonates and infants with congenital hypothyroidism, overt bradycardia is uncommon even in severe cases, likely due to developmental compensation and the immature autonomic system; thus, the classic bradycardia phenotype is more characteristic of adult-onset hypothyroidism rather than neonatal disease [^af86d437] [^0c6516e4].

> Let me integrate these mechanisms. Bradycardia in hypothyroidism arises from a triad: direct genomic effects that downregulate pacemaker and calcium-handling genes, autonomic imbalance with relative sympathetic withdrawal, and structural compression/fibrosis of nodal tissue in severe disease; importantly, all three components are responsive to thyroid hormone therapy, which restores gene expression, improves autonomic function, and reverses myxedematous changes, thereby normalizing heart rate and conduction in most patients [^a8ebbf71] [^26e7a3bb] [^37c6cdd3] [^5f70546d].

> I should confirm the clinical implications. Because hypothyroidism is a reversible cause of bradyarrhythmias, guidelines advise screening thyroid function in patients with sinus node dysfunction or AV block and prioritizing thyroxine therapy before committing to permanent pacing, except in select scenarios where pacing cannot be deferred. This approach prevents unnecessary device implants and addresses the root cause of bradycardia [^5f70546d] [^00fc3766] [^4ac6f3f8].

---

Bradycardia in hypothyroidism is primarily due to **reduced thyroid hormone levels** that slow sinus node automaticity and atrioventricular conduction via downregulation of HCN2/4 pacemaker channels [^a8ebbf71], decreased SERCA2a activity, and impaired calcium handling [^ee373a52]. Additional contributors include **increased vagal tone** [^26e7a3bb], myxedema-related infiltration of the conduction system [^37c6cdd3], and autonomic imbalance with sympathetic withdrawal [^74e41a55]. These effects are **reversible with thyroid hormone replacement** [^5f70546d], which restores heart rate and conduction [^4ac6f3f8].

---

## Direct effects of thyroid hormone deficiency on cardiac electrophysiology

Thyroid hormone (T3) exerts **genomic and non-genomic effects** on the heart, regulating ion channels, calcium handling, and contractile proteins [^ee373a52]. In hypothyroidism, reduced T3 leads to:

- **Downregulation of pacemaker channels**: T3 normally upregulates HCN2 and HCN4 channels in the sinoatrial node; deficiency reduces the "funny current" (If), slowing spontaneous depolarization and causing bradycardia [^a8ebbf71].

- **Impaired calcium handling**: Reduced SERCA2a and altered calcium cycling slow diastolic depolarization and conduction [^ee373a52].

- **Altered ion channel expression**: Changes in potassium and calcium channels prolong action potentials and refractory periods, contributing to conduction delay [^89b2e833].

---

## Autonomic nervous system imbalance

Hypothyroidism shifts autonomic balance toward **increased vagal tone and sympathetic withdrawal**, which slows sinus node discharge and AV conduction [^26e7a3bb]. Heart rate variability studies show reduced sympathetic activity and increased vagal tone in hypothyroidism, reinforcing this mechanism [^74e41a55].

---

## Structural and histological changes in the conduction system

In severe or longstanding hypothyroidism, **myxedema causes interstitial edema, mucopolysaccharide deposition, and fibrosis** around the SA and AV nodes, compressing conduction tissue and impairing impulse propagation [^37c6cdd3]. These changes are reversible with thyroid hormone therapy, explaining clinical improvement after treatment [^4ac6f3f8].

---

## Clinical evidence and reversibility

Bradycardia in hypothyroidism is **well-documented and reversible** with thyroid hormone replacement [^5f70546d]. Guidelines emphasize identifying and treating reversible causes — including hypothyroidism — before considering permanent pacing [^00fc3766]. Case reports describe resolution of severe bradycardia, conduction block, and even torsades de pointes after levothyroxine therapy, underscoring the causal role of thyroid deficiency [^4cd7bed1] [^3701cbcd].

Bradycardia in hypothyroidism reflects **multifactorial mechanisms**: direct effects of T3 deficiency on pacemaker and conduction tissue, autonomic imbalance, and structural changes in severe disease. These abnormalities are **reversible with thyroid hormone replacement**, making early recognition and treatment essential to avoid unnecessary pacing and complications [^5f70546d].

### Clinical implication of COVID-19 associated bradycardia [^0356776b]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Kumar and colleagues performed a large‐scale multicenter retrospective study including more than 1000 COVID‐19 patients and found that bradycardia was prevalent and associated with higher mortality among them. Their findings are of great interest because infection and high fever are, in general, associated with tachycardia. Several concerns have been raised.

To further clarify the mechanism of COVID‐19 associated bradycardia, it is of great interest to investigate the type of bradycardia: sinus bradycardia, AV block, or atrial fibrillation. Noncardiac causes should be carefully excluded, including sedation, conduction‐suppressive medications, and hypothyroidism.

The causality between bradycardia and mortality remains unclear. Bradycardia might be a marker of the advanced stage of COVID‐19 or a direct cause of death. Bradycardia might be more prevalent in patients with COVID‐19 associated myocarditis with incremental troponin level. On the other hand, bradycardia might cause low cardiac output accompanying cardiogenic shock. If bradycardia is harmful, aggressive intervention to bradycardia, including pacemaker therapy, would be beneficial. In their study, was the dominant cause of death in patients with bradycardia respiratory failure or heart failure?

In acute care, atropine should not be given in patients after heart transplant, and in patients with drug toxicity and severe symptoms, preparation for pacing should proceed simultaneously with pharmacologic treatment of drug toxicity.

### Association of subclinical hypothyroidism and cardiovascular disease with mortality [^52a88365]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Subclinical hypothyroidism, or elevated thyrotropin (TSH) levels with normal levels of free thyroxine (FT 4), is a common disorder affecting approximately 10% of the adult population. A previous reviewhas reported cardiovascular abnormalities such as left ventricular dysfunction and impaired vascular relaxation among people with not only overt hypothyroidism but also subclinical hypothyroidism. Inadequate serum thyroid hormone produces impairment of cardiac function and may result in bradycardia, endothelial dysfunction, increased intima-media thickness, diastolic dysfunction, increased vascular resistance, and pericardial effusion. Other epidemiological studies, have also found an association between subclinical hypothyroidism or high-normal TSH concentrations (ie, serum TSH concentrations at the upper end of the normal range) and dyslipidemia, increased insulin resistance, and hypertension — components of metabolic syndrome.

Despite these mechanisms and evidence about the potential burden of elevated TSH on cardiac metabolism, the potentially causal link between subclinical hypothyroidism, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and death remains unclear. Recent individual patient meta-analysis by the Thyroid Studies Collaboration, did not find higher risk of CVD and all-cause mortality among adults with subclinical hypothyroidism compared with those with euthyroidism, which is supported by current clinical guidelines proposing that thyroid hormone replacement therapy should not be routinely offered for adults with subclinical hypothyroidism. Meanwhile, some recent studies, have suggested that even high-normal TSH concentrations are associated with increased risk of CVD and mortality among the US general population or adults with chronic kidney disease, indicating the importance of considering variations in the normative range of TSH when assessing long-term adverse health outcomes.

Mediation analysis has been increasingly used in clinical research to help evaluate underlying mechanisms of diseases. This epidemiological method decomposes the total association of a risk factor with the outcome (eg, subclinical hypothyroidism or high-normal TSH concentrations with mortality) into a direct association (not through CVD) and an indirect association (through CVD). The distinction of direct and indirect associations helps us to consider the potential effectiveness of intervention strategies; if there are substantial indirect associations for subclinical hypothyroidism or high-normal TSH concentrations, active screening for CVD for patients with subclinical hypothyroidism may be helpful to mitigate the increased mortality risk in this group.

Based on the association between hypothyroidism and CVD, we used a mediation analysis to investigate the strength of any mediation from subclinical hypothyroidism or high-normal TSH concentrations to all-cause mortality via CVD in the general US population.

### Amiodarone hydrochloride (Pacerone) [^5d59e581]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Thyroid Abnormalities

Amiodarone hydrochloride inhibits peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause increased thyroxine levels, decreased T3levels, and increased levels of inactive reverse T3(rT3) in clinically euthyroid patients. Amiodarone hydrochloride can cause either hypothyroidism (reported in up to 10% of patients) or hyperthyroidism (occurring in about 2% of patients). Monitor thyroid function prior to treatment and periodically thereafter, particularly in elderly patients, and in any patient with a history of thyroid nodules, goiter, or other thyroid dysfunction.

Hyperthyroidism may induce arrhythmia breakthrough. If any new signs of arrhythmia appear, the possibility of hyperthyroidism should be considered. Antithyroid drugs, β-adrenergic blockers, temporary corticosteroid therapy may be necessary to treat the symptoms of hyperthyroidism. The action of antithyroid drugs may be delayed in amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis because of substantial quantities of preformed thyroid hormones stored in the gland. Radioactive iodine therapy is contraindicated because of the low radioiodine uptake associated with amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism. Pacerone-induced hyperthyroidism may be followed by a transient period of hypothyroidism.

Hypothyroidism may be primary or subsequent to resolution of preceding amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism. Severe hypothyroidism and myxedema coma, sometimes fatal, have been reported in association with amiodarone therapy. In some clinically hypothyroid amiodarone-treated patients, free thyroxine index values may be normal. Manage hypothyroidism by reducing the dose of or discontinuing Pacerone and thyroid hormone supplementation.

5.7 Bradycardia

Pacerone causes symptomatic bradycardia or sinus arrest with suppression of escape foci in 2% to 4% of patients. The risk is increased by electrolytic disorders or use of concomitant antiarrhythmics or negative chronotropes [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Bradycardia may require a pacemaker for rate control.

Post-marketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia, some requiring pacemaker insertion and at least one fatal, have been reported when ledipasvir/sofosbuvir or sofosbuvir with simeprevir were initiated in patients on amiodarone. Bradycardia generally occurred within hours to days, but in some cases presented up to 2 weeks after initiating antiviral treatment. Bradycardia generally resolved after discontinuation of antiviral treatment. The mechanism for this effect is unknown. Monitor heart rate in patients taking or recently discontinuing amiodarone when starting antiviral treatment [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Thyroid dysfunction in torsades de pointes… [^a2b67292]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor The Challenges in Clinical Electrocardiography article by Chew et al1 published in a recent issue of JAMA Internal Medicine describes the occurrence of recurrent syncope secondary to torsades de pointes in a middle-aged woman. 1 Alcohol and dextromethorphan use coupled with electrolyte abnormalities contributed to life-threatening polymorphic ventricular tachycardia treated with intravenous magnesium, amiodarone, and a temporary pacemaker. Although the clinical presentation, risk factors, and management aspects are well described, the patient's thyroid function is not mentioned. Hypothyroidism has been reported as a rare but treatable cause of electrocardiographic QT prolongation and TdP. 2, 3 Severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, especially when accompanied by structural cardiac changes, cardiomyopathy, and congestive heart failure, 4 can lead to bradycardia and first-degree block, and in some situations, precipitate ventricular dysrhythmias.

Appropriate management has been reported to abolish the latter and may obviate the need for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. 5 It is conceivable that in many of these cases a multitude of causative factors are involved, as in the patient described by Chew et al. 1 However, satisfactory improvement may not occur if the hypothyroid state is overlooked and left untreated. In addition, the patient received the antiarrythmic drug amiodarone, which is high in iodine content and can induce thyroid dysfunction. Thus, an additional important reason to have knowledge of the thyroid status would be prior to the consideration of amiodarone administration. It is recommended that thyroid function be assessed early in the presentation of ventricular tachyarrythmias and TdP so that proper therapy can be instituted. Rizvi AA.

### Resistance to thyroid hormone induced tachycardia in RTH α syndrome [^3a7903ca]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Mutations in thyroid hormone receptor α1 (TRα1) cause Resistance to Thyroid Hormone α (RTHα), a disorder characterized by hypothyroidism in TRα1-expressing tissues including the heart. Surprisingly, we report that treatment of RTHα patients with thyroxine to overcome tissue hormone resistance does not elevate their heart rate. Cardiac telemetry in male, TRα1 mutant, mice indicates that such persistent bradycardia is caused by an intrinsic cardiac defect and not due to altered autonomic control. Transcriptomic analyses show preserved, thyroid hormone (T3)-dependent upregulation of pacemaker channels (Hcn2, Hcn4), but irreversibly reduced expression of several ion channel genes controlling heart rate. Exposure of TRα1 mutant male mice to higher maternal T3 concentrations in utero, restores altered expression and DNA methylation of ion channels, including Ryr2. Our findings indicate that target genes other than Hcn2 and Hcn4 mediate T3-induced tachycardia and suggest that treatment of RTHα patients with thyroxine in high dosage without concomitant tachycardia, is possible.

Introduction

Thyroid hormones (THs) exert profound chronotropic and inotropic cardiovascular effects, manifesting as bradycardia in hypothyroidism whilst tachycardia is a leading symptom of hyperthyroidism. The actions of THs are mediated by their nuclear TH receptors, TRα1 and TRβ, which are encoded by the two different genes THRA and THRB. In the heart, TRα1 is the predominant isoform and mediates the known effects of the hormone such as increasing contractility, oxygen consumption, cardiac output as well as heart rate –. Several bona fide target genes of TH action in the heart have been identified, including the pacemaker channels HCN2 and HCN4 (Hyperpolarization-activated Cyclic Nucleotide-gated Channel 2 and 4), which conduct the "funny current" in the sinoatrial node that generates slow diastolic depolarization to the threshold, initiating a propagated action potential spreading through the entire heart. Additionally, the voltage-gated potassium channels KCNA5 and KCND2 that contribute to the early repolarization of cardiomyocytes as well as the calcium flux modulating proteins ATP2A2 (SERCA2) and RYR2 are also known targets of TH. In addition to the direct actions on peripheral tissues, TH can also act centrally in the brain, altering the output of the autonomic nervous system to liver or brown adipose tissue. Although this paradigm of acute central action of TH has not yet been convincingly demonstrated for the cardiovascular system, it is widely assumed that hyperthyroidism reduces the vagal tone of the parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS) while activating the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Together with proposed increases in activity of the adrenergic receptor ADRB1 and the pacemaker channels HCN2 and HCN4, these mechanisms are currently assumed to mediate the tachycardia of thyrotoxicosis.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Acute management of SND — reversible causes recommends that in symptomatic patients presenting with SND, evaluation and treatment of reversible causes is recommended. Most patients with SND present with chronic complaints that do not require acute treatment, and most causes of SND are chronic and irreversible, although sinus bradyarrhythmias are attributable to potentially reversible causes such as acute MI, atrial tachyarrhythmias, electrolyte abnormalities, hypothyroidism, medications, infections, and metabolic abnormalities. Because patients are typically stable and minimally symptomatic on presentation with SND, no acute therapy is usually required and evaluation of SND and assessment for potentially reversible causes can be performed in an outpatient setting. In some cases, although evaluation of reversible causes for SND should be undertaken, treatment may not be necessary, for example stopping a beta blocker in an asymptomatic patient with sinus bradycardia after ST-elevation MI, and some patients with tachy-brady syndrome may have improvement of sinoatrial node function after treatment aimed at maintaining sinus rhythm.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: how to manage neonatal bradycardia [^f3523445]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2025). Medium credibility.

Neonatal bradycardia is characterised by a heart rate below 80 bpm, irrespective of gestational age. It is generally self-resolving but, in some cases, represents an underlying pathology which may be cardiac or non-cardiac in origin. The common causes for bradycardia are non-cardiac in origin such as autonomic immaturity in premature infants, electrolyte imbalances, hypothyroidism and medications. Cardiac causes include-sinus bradycardia, conduction system abnormalities, congenital heart disease and channelopathies. Diagnostic investigations typically include a standard 12-lead ECG, 24-hour Holter monitor and an echocardiogram. This article aims to provide a practical framework for the management of neonates with bradycardia and guide further investigation and/or referral to specialist paediatric cardiology services.

### Sinus arrest and cardiogenic shock precipitated by immune checkpoint inhibitors [^37c6cdd3]. JACC: CardioOncology (2020). Medium credibility.

ICIs can also be a cause of indirect cardiovascular toxicity as a result of endocrinopathies. Endocrinopathy due to ICIs have been reported in up to 5% of patients, with hypothyroidism in up to 8% of patients through a mechanism that is thought to be autoimmune in nature due to increased immunogenicity driven by the therapeutics. IrAEs causing endocrinopathy, including both hyper- and hypothyroidism, have a wide range of effects on the cardiovascular system including effects on conduction, contraction, and rate. Current National Comprehensive Cancer Network and American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guidelines recommend baseline and routine monitoring of TSH and FT4 every 4 to 6 weeks while on ICI therapy. IrAEs can also cause adrenal insufficiency which can result in profound hypotension. As a result, if endocrinopathy due to thyroid disorder is suspected, adrenal insufficiency and hypophysitis should be considered and excluded. In myxedema, the effect on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes resulting in bradycardia is postulated to be due to edema, fibrosis, and mucin deposition compressing the conduction apparatus, with reversal of edema following normalization of circulating thyroid hormone levels. Treatment of the underlying thyroid imbalance has been shown to improve conduction in case reports.

Here, we report a case of ICI-induced severe hypothyroidism leading to sinus node dysfunction and cardiogenic shock presentation. This particular case required the exclusion of potential myocarditis and pericardial disease, and prompt attention to other irAEs that may have caused symptoms.

ICIs have a wide variety of cardiovascular side effects (Figure 2) and should be understood by clinicians due to the increased use of this class of medications. This case demonstrates a reported adverse effect of this class of medications, indirect cardiotoxicity induced via severe hypothyroidism leading to sinus arrest with subsequent cardiogenic shock requiring transvenous pacing, which completely resolved following administration of thyroid replacement. Awareness of both direct and indirect side effects of medical therapeutics is essential to providing comprehensive medical care for patients with complex, noncardiac primary diagnoses.

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^b3ea8160]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism — hemodynamics and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) context: The hemodynamic changes typical of hypothyroidism are opposite to those of hyperthyroidism and are accompanied by fewer symptoms and signs, with bradycardia, mild hypertension (often diastolic), and a narrowed pulse pressure. Pericardial effusions and nonpitting edema (myxedema) can occur in severe, long-standing hypothyroidism, but DCM is not a characteristic feature; there are case reports in which DCM improved with thyroid hormonal replacement. Low cardiac output in hypothyroidism is caused by bradycardia, a decrease in ventricular filling, and a decrease in cardiac contractility, and systemic vascular resistance can increase by as much as 50%, while clinical HF is rare.

Laboratory testing in bradycardia — Isolated case reports have identified medical conditions associated with bradycardia in which laboratory testing directed toward a specific diagnosis can be useful, including thyroid function tests for suspected hypothyroidism and Lyme titer to identify acute Lyme carditis in a young person with atrioventricular block in an endemic area; however, there have been no studies that have systematically evaluated the additional value of laboratory testing in patients who present primarily with bradycardia.

- **Definition**: Hypothyroidism is a chronic endocrine disease associated with the deficiency of thyroxine and T3 thyroid hormones.
- **Pathophysiology**: Hypothyroidism is most frequently caused by a failure of the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones (99%). Other causes include the underproduction of TSH by the pituitary gland and deficiency of the thyrotropin-releasing hormone.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of overt and subclinical hypothyroidism in the US is estimated at 300 per 100,000 population and 4,300 per 100,000 population, respectively. Hypothyroidism is 2–8 times more prevalent in women than men, and it's prevalence increases with age.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include weight gain, fatigue, proximal weakness, decreased concentration, depression, diffuse muscle pain, menstrual irregularities, constipation, dry skin, hair loss, and sensory neuropathy. A severe form of hypothyroidism-myxedema coma- presents with altered mental status, hypothermia, hyponatremia and bradycardia. The disease decreases productivity and QoL.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Hypothyroidism is not associated with an increase in mortality. Treatment is well tolerated and results in improved QoL in most patients. However, untreated hypothyroidism leads to disease progression and ultimately, coma and death.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to patients with comorbidities, ACC/AHA/HRS 2019 guidelines recommend to consider permanent cardiac pacing without further observation for reversibility in patients with symptomatic second-degree or third-degree AV block associated with thyroid function abnormalities but without clinical myxedema.

### The impact of thyroid function on surgical prognosis in patients undergoing cardiac and major vascular surgeries [^4aa013e7]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

The observed mechanisms likely involve multiple pathophysiological processes. Thyroid dysfunction can affect hemodynamics, endothelial function, and coagulation pathways, increasing the risk of perioperative complications in cardiac and major vascular surgery. In hypothyroid patients, reduced thyroid hormone levels lead to decreased cardiac output and increased systemic vascular resistance, resulting in impaired tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery — critical factors during and after surgery. Conversely, hyperthyroidism elevates cardiac output and heart rate, increasing myocardial oxygen consumption and heightening the risk of ischemia, particularly in patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases. Low thyroid hormone levels impair myocardial contractility, leading to bradycardia and decreased stroke volume, which can prolong recovery times and elevate the risk of perioperative cardiac events. Although elevated thyroid hormone levels enhance myocardial contractility, they also cause tachycardia and increase the risk of arrhythmias. Thyroid hormone deficiency further contributes to endothelial dysfunction by reducing nitric oxide production, a vital regulator of vascular tone. This may promote atherosclerosis, increase vascular stiffness, and exacerbate perioperative complications. While hyperthyroidism may initially improve endothelial function by increasing nitric oxide production, chronic hyperthyroid states can lead to endothelial injury and dysfunction, raising the risk of thromboembolic events. Additionally, hyperthyroidism is associated with a pro-thrombotic state characterized by elevated fibrinogen levels and reduced fibrinolysis, increasing the risk of venous thromboembolism and clotting complications during the perioperative period. Patients with hypothyroidism or subclinical hypothyroidism also exhibit a lower basal metabolic rate, making them more prone to hypothermia during surgery and delaying postoperative recovery.

Overall, these findings hold certain clinical significance for the perioperative management of patients with thyroid dysfunction, suggesting the necessity of preoperative thyroid function screening for those undergoing cardiac and major vascular surgery. However, this study has several limitations. First, the retrospective design may introduce selection bias, which limits the ability to establish causal relationships. Second, potential confounding factors, such as intraoperative medications (e.g. high-dose corticosteroids, dopamine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, heparin), inflammation, and preoperative angiography, were not fully controlled, underscoring the need for further prospective studies. Additionally, the study participants were predominantly from the Chinese population, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other populations. Therefore, future prospective studies should aim to include larger, more diverse populations to validate and strengthen these results.

### Resistance to thyroid hormone induced tachycardia in RTH α syndrome [^14aec2ee]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The human disorder of Resistance to Thyroid Hormone α (RTHα), or congenital, nongoitrous hypothyroidism 6 (OMIM 614450), due to heterozygous mutations in TRα1, is characterized by refractoriness to TH action in TRα1-expressing tissues (e.g. central nervous system, bone, myocardium, skeletal muscle, gastrointestinal tract). Thyroxine therapy of RTHα is beneficial, improving linear growth, increasing resting energy expenditure to limit weight gain, alleviating constipation and enhancing wellbeing and affect of patients –. However, as treatment with high dosages of thyroxine is required to overcome tissue hormone resistance, this therapeutic approach could potentially be associated with thyrotoxic side effects including in the cardiovascular system.

In this work, we unexpectedly find that high dose thyroxine therapy of RTHα patients with a partial loss-of-function mutation (A263V) in TRαdoes not elevate their heart rate. Investigating underlying mechanisms mediating this, we studied the cardiac phenotype in mice harboring a TRα1R384C mutation, which exhibits similar, partial, loss-of-function. Using these mice, we find that the effects of TH on heart rate are largely direct, whilst its effects via the autonomic nervous system predominantly affect heart rate frequency distribution rather than average heart rate. Combining cardiac telemetry and microarray-based transcriptomics, we demonstrate that the TH mediated upregulation of Hcn2 and Hcn4 expression is not associated with changes in heart rate. Furthermore, we find that impaired TRα1 action during mouse development programs irreversible changes in expression of multiple cardiac genes, including potassium and calcium channels. We suggest that such developmental programming by altered epigenetic DNA methylation accounts for the observed lack of elevation in heart rate following treatment of RTHα patients with thyroxine in high dosage.

### 2018 European Thyroid Association (ETA) guidelines on the diagnosis and management of central hypothyroidism [^a713c46b]. European Thyroid Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for central hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to thyroid function tests, ETA 2018 guidelines recommend to consider supporting the diagnosis of mild CeH (borderline low free T4 with inappropriately low TSH) by a combination of several other findings, such as:

- evidence of CeH in first-degree relatives

- delayed growth, macroorchidism, hearing loss, other signs of hypothyroidism

- causative mutations in CeH candidate genes

- insufficiency of other pituitary hormone secretion

- blunted (< 4 mU/L) or delayed (peak after 60 minutes) TSH responses to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (200 mcg IV)

- blunted nocturnal TSH surge

- low TSH index

- otherwise unexplained alterations in variables of thyroid hormone action (such as high cholesterol, bradycardia, low body temperature, echocardiographic findings).

### Sudden extensive bloody pleural and pericardial effusion in a subject with untreated known hypothyroidism after total thyroidectomy, triggered by pneumonia [^8ac0f521]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Severe hypothyroidism causes hypothermia and bradycardia. It is known that in severe conditions with a marked inflammatory response as observed in this case, an adaptive response to reduced thyroid hormone demand can reduce catabolism to protect the body. In hypothyroidism, bradycardia may not be present even in cases where bradycardia should be present such as in cardiac tamponade. It is assumed that a similar mechanism is responsible for the reduced tachycardic response in the present case. In most cases of serious diseases, there are other important signs besides vital signs, but in the case of hypothyroidism, vital signs may not be serious at first glance as observed in this case, and thus we must be careful about this point.

Although bloody fluid retention due to hypothyroidism is very rare and its pathogenesis is not known, we experienced a case of hypothyroidism with bloody pleural effusion and bloody pericardial effusion both of which were improved by pericardial drainage and thyroid hormone replacement therapy after excluding the possibility of other diseases. Taken together, we must bear in mind that bloody pleural effusion and bloody pericardial effusion that is not seen when hypothyroidism is present alone can be brought on by hypothyroidism when complicated by other serious diseases such as infection.

### Evaluation of cardiac autonomic function in patients with alteration in thyroid hormones: systematic literature review [^74e41e55]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Thyroid hormonal disorders are widely discussed in the literature. These dysfunctions also influence the modulation of the cardiovascular system due to alterations in the autonomic nervous system, affecting heart rate variability.

Objectives

To verify the influence of thyroidian hormonal dysfunctions on the modulation of cardiac autonomic activity.

Methods

A systematic review was carried out to search for studies used in the electronic databases Virtual Health Library (VHL), Scielo, Pubmed via Medline, Cochrane, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Cinahl and SPORTDiscus, without restrictions how many years. For this review, we have considered experimental studies carried out with human beings that will analyse the variability of heart rate in the thyroid hormone diseases.

Results

Ten thousand two hundred ninety-eight items found, 15 included, which were non-randomised clinical trials that assessed heart rate variability domains. I note that patients affected by hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism have a reduction in heart rate variability, reflecting a decrease in the adaptive capacity of the heart.

Conclusion

Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism affect cardiac autonomic modulation, resulting in a reduction in heart rate variability. However, there were differences in relation to the availability of frequency and time data.

### Thyroid disease and the heart [^876b3071]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

The cardiovascular signs and symptoms of thyroid disease are some of the most profound and clinically relevant findings that accompany both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. On the basis of the understanding of the cellular mechanisms of thyroid hormone action on the heart and cardiovascular system, it is possible to explain the changes in cardiac output, cardiac contractility, blood pressure, vascular resistance, and rhythm disturbances that result from thyroid dysfunction. The importance of the recognition of the effects of thyroid disease on the heart also derives from the observation that restoration of normal thyroid function most often reverses the abnormal cardiovascular hemodynamics. In the present review, we discuss the appropriate thyroid function tests to establish a suspected diagnosis as well as the treatment modalities necessary to restore patients to a euthyroid state. We also review the alterations in thyroid hormone metabolism that accompany chronic congestive heart failure and the approach to the management of patients with amiodarone-induced alterations in thyroid function tests.

### Preoperative thyroid assessment in pacemaker recipients: are we falling short? [^66650f7e]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a reversible cause of bradyarrhythmias, including atrioventricular blocks and sinus node dysfunction. Guidelines recommend thyroid function assessment before pacemaker implantation. This study aims to evaluate the extent of preoperative assessment of thyroid dysfunction in pacemaker recipients. Data from a national database of consecutive transvenous pacemaker recipients (October 2004-October 2024) were analyzed. Initially, preoperative thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was assessed at 12, 6, and 3 months before implantation. Subsequently, patients were classified according to their most recent thyroid profile. Among 45,683 eligible pacemaker recipients, TSH testing was performed in 37.1%, 52.7%, and 70.2% of patients within 3, 6 and 12 months before the procedure, respectively. The proportion of pacemaker recipients undergoing thyroid screening progressively increased over time, with screening rates rising in parallel with advancing age. After excluding individuals with missing free thyroxine data (n = 320), 31,774 patients were classified as euthyroid (84.3%), subclinical hypothyroid (12.2%), overt hypothyroid (0.7%), or subclinical hyperthyroid (2.7%). Patients with thyroid dysfunction were predominantly female, older, and exhibited a higher burden of comorbidities (all p < 0.001). In conclusion, significant gaps exist in the evaluation of thyroid function prior to pacemaker implantation, with a substantial proportion of recipients remaining suboptimally balanced. Further research is imperative to elucidate the association between thyroid status and the reversibility of conduction abnormalities.

### Clinical review 142: cardiac dysrhythmias and thyroid dysfunction: the hidden menace? [^4c4867de]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

Thyrotoxicosis is often perceived as a reversible disorder without long-term consequences, perhaps because of the availability of effective treatments, but recent evidence suggests that there may, in fact, be adverse outcomes. Long-term follow-up studies have revealed increased mortality from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease in those with a past history of overt hyperthyroidism treated with radioiodine as well as in those with subclinical hyperthyroidism indicated by a low serum TSH concentration. Thyroid hormones exert direct effects on the myocardium as well as the systemic vasculature predisposing to dysrhythmias, especially supraventricular. Effects of thyroid hormones on the autonomic nervous system may also contribute to arrhythmogenesis. Atrial fibrillation is a recognized complication of hyperthyroidism that predisposes to embolic events. Development of atrial fibrillation, together with other supraventricular dysrhythmias (both clinically obvious and those detected only by Holter monitoring) in those with hyperthyroidism may account for increased vascular mortality. Improved detection of supraventricular dysrhythmias and therapeutic intervention (e.g. anticoagulants, antiarrhythmics) may improve the long-term vascular prognosis, but their role remains to be established in large therapeutic trials.

### Hypothyroid cardiomyopathy in a patient post-doxorubicin chemotherapy [^9fd9ee1f]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism may cause decreased cardiac output and heart failure-and when severe, bradycardia and pericardial effusions may develop. Chemotherapies, particularly doxorubicin, are known and often irreversible causes of cardiomyopathy. As such, when cardiomyopathy develops in patients who have been exposed to anthracycline chemotherapy, the importance of ruling out other reversible causes such as hypothyroidism cannot be overstated. We present a case of acute systolic heart failure in a patient post-doxorubicin chemotherapy and radiation therapy for alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, found to have severe hypothyroidism as a reversible cause of cardiomyopathy.

### Resistance to thyroid hormone induced tachycardia in RTH α syndrome [^15ad8f49]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Whilst RTH due to TRβ mutations has long been recognized, individuals with a mutation in TRα1 were discovered relatively recently, and often exhibit resting bradycardia. Our studies show that such reduction in their resting heart rate together with refractoriness to the expected rise following thyroxine therapy of patients in high dosage, is likely to be due to effects of mutant TRα1 during embryonic development, irreversibly reprogramming cardiac pacemaker function. These observations suggest that thyroxine therapy of RTHα, in dosage sufficient to overcome hormone resistance, can be undertaken without inducing the detrimental tachycardia associated with elevated circulating thyroid hormones. Nevertheless, as several genes (e.g. Kcnh2) that are downregulated in TRα1R384C mutant mice are associated with arrhythmia or sudden death, close monitoring of thyroxine-treated RTHα patients seems advisable.

Overall, our data show that impaired TRα1 signalling during embryonal development leads to cardiac reprogramming which confers resistance to T3-induced tachycardia. At the molecular level, such resistance occurs despite expected upregulation of Hcn2 and Hcn4, indicating that these classical T3 target genes alone are not sufficient to mediate the tachycardia of hyperthyroidism. Reduced expression of other target genes (the Ryr2 calcium channel; the Kcnh2 potassium channel), likely contribute to the resistance to T3-induced tachycardia seen in TRα1 mutant mice. Most importantly, these observations provide a mechanistic understanding for the lack of tachycardia in thyroxine-treated RTHα patients, suggesting that high dose hormone therapy of this disorder may be safer than previously thought.

### Central hypothyroidism impairs heart rate stability and prevents thyroid hormone-induced cardiac hypertrophy and pyrexia [^094cc351]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: Tachycardia, cardiac hypertrophy, and elevated body temperature are major signs of systemic hyperthyroidism, which are considered to reflect the excessive thyroid hormone (TH) action in the respective peripheral tissues. However, recent observations indicate that the central actions of TH also contribute substantially to cardiovascular regulation and thermogenesis. Methods: In this study, we dissect the individual contributions of peripheral TH action versus the central effects in body temperature regulation and cardiovascular functions by taking advantage of mice lacking the TH transporters monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) and organic anion transporting polypeptide 1C1 (OATP1C1) (M/O double knock-out [dko]), which exhibit elevated serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels while their brain is in a profoundly hypothyroid state. We compared these animals with wild-type (WT) mice that were treated orally with T3 to achieve similarly elevated serum T3 levels, but are centrally hyperthyroid. For the studies, we used radiotelemetry, infrared thermography, gene expression profiling, Western blot analyses, and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) assays. Results: Our analyses revealed mild hyperthermia and cardiac hypertrophy in T3-treated WT mice but not in M/O dko animals, suggesting that central actions of TH are required for these hyperthyroid phenotypes. Although the average heart rate was unaffected in either model, the M/O dko exhibited an altered heart rate frequency distribution with tachycardic bursts in active periods and bradycardic episodes during resting time, demonstrating that the stabilization of heart rate by the autonomic nervous system can be impaired in centrally hypothyroid animals. Conclusions: Our studies unravel distinct phenotypical traits of hyperthyroidism that depend on an intact central nervous system, and provide valuable insight into the cardiovascular pathology of the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, a condition caused by the lack of MCT8 in humans.

### Severe primary hypothyroidism presenting with torsades de pointes [^3701cbcd]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

An 85-year-old lady presented to our institution following multiple episodes of transient loss of consciousness. Her admission ECG revealed a junctional bradycardia with significant QT prolongation. Telemetry captured a torsades de pointes arrhythmia. Possible offending drugs (digoxin and hydroxychloroquine) were stopped and she was given intravenous magnesium and potassium. Despite this, she continued to have runs of torsades. An isoprenaline infusion was commenced to increase her resting heart rate. Her QT interval shortened and she had no further arrhythmia. Investigation into the cause of her bradycardia and prolonged QT revealed profound hypothyroidism. Levothyroxine was commenced but the patient remained bradycardia and required a permanent pacemaker. She had no further arrhythmia and was discharged home safely. This is a very rare case of severe primary hypothyroidism presenting with torsades de pointes.

### Value of the electrocardiogram in clinical practice… [^ddb3b1d2]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The irregularities of the heart often confound the physician. The electrocardiogram is the final court of authority in all cardiac irregularities. The normal sinus mechanism varies from 60 to 100 beats per minute. Sinus bradycardia occurs with a rate below 60 per minute. Tachycardia denotes a rate above 100 per minute. Most sinus rhythms occur in normal hearts. The bradycardia of myxedema and beriberi and the tachycardia of heart failure are exceptions. Bradycardia with a normal heart may be due to effect of digitalis, jaundice, brain tumor or meningitis, tumor of the neck or mediastinum, pressure on the eyeball or massage of the carotid sinus. Tachycardia with a normal heart may be caused by exertion, excitement, use of coffee, tea, alcohol, tobacco, or food, pain, medication with atropine, epinephrine or the nitrites, thyrotoxicosis or CARTER JB.

### High thyrotropin is critical for cardiac electrical remodeling and arrhythmia vulnerability in hypothyroidism [^17a58dc8]. Thyroid (2019). Medium credibility.

To translate to the human heart the experimental data on susceptibility to triggered arrhythmia in hypothyroidism, computer simulations of the electrophysiological behavior of human cardiomyocytes were used. When the primary hypothyroid phenotype was introduced in the models, EADs and arrhythmias appeared, and their incidence increased after β-adrenergic stimulation, consistent with the higher incidence of arrhythmias in patients with primary hypothyroidism and with the current in vivo and in vitro experimental results. It is also interesting to note that EADs and arrhythmias emerged only under β-adrenergic stimulation in the central hypothyroidism models. As pointed out, an increase in I Ca-L reportedly due to thyroid hormone deficiency may contribute to EAD triggering during β-adrenergic stimulation in individuals with either type of hypothyroidism.

From a clinical perspective, several independent studies proposed that elevated serum TSH levels play an essential causal role in the QT prolongation and dispersion (QTd) in patients with overt hypothyroidism. These abnormalities revert after hormone replacement and normalization of TSH levels. Here, based on the observations of the direct effect of TSH on the K + currents, a mechanistic explanation is proposed for the TSH-dependent electrocardiographic alterations and its possible contribution to enhanced susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmias. These results, together with the recently published association between high normal TSH levels and increased risk of mortality, further contribute to answering the question of whether serum TSH reference ranges should be reexamined.

Atrioventricular block — etiologies encompass congenital/genetic, infectious, inflammatory/infiltrative, ischemic, degenerative, vagotonic, metabolic/endocrine, other diseases, and iatrogenic causes. Examples include congenital AV block associated with maternal systemic lupus erythematosus, congenital heart defects (eg, L-TGA), and genetic variants (eg, SCN5A mutations); infections such as Lyme carditis, bacterial endocarditis with perivalvar abscess, acute rheumatic fever, Chagas disease, and toxoplasmosis; inflammatory/infiltrative conditions including myocarditis, amyloidosis, cardiac sarcoidosis, and Rheumatologic disease: Systemic sclerosis, SLE, RA, reactive arthritis (Reiter's syndrome); other cardiomyopathy — idiopathic, valvular; ischemic causes such as acute MI, coronary ischemia without infarction — unstable angina, variant angina, and chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy; degenerative Lev's and Lenegre's diseases; vagotonic-associated with increased vagal tone including sleep, obstructive sleep apnea, high-level athletic conditioning, and neurocardiogenic; metabolic/endocrine disorders including acid-base disorders, poisoning/overdose (eg, mercury, cyanide, carbon monoxide, mad honey), thyroid disease (both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism), and adrenal disease (eg, pheochromocytoma, hypoaldosteronism); other diseases including neuromuscular diseases (eg, myotonic dystrophy, Kearns-Sayre syndrome, Erb's dystrophy) and lymphoma; and iatrogenic mechanisms such as medication related agents including Beta blockers, verapamil, diltiazem, digoxin, Antiarrhythmic drugs, Neutraceuticals, catheter ablation, cardiac surgery, and TAVR, alcohol septal ablation.

### Hypothyroidism and reversible kidney dysfunction: an essential relationship to recognize [^3ffacebc]. Endocrine Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To report 3 cases of reversible hypothyroidism-induced kidney dysfunction and review the interaction between these commonly encountered, yet seemingly disparate, conditions.

Methods

We describe the clinical course and laboratory and physical findings of 3 patients who presented with kidney dysfunction that improved after initiating thyroid hormone replacement therapy. We also review similar cases in the literature and discuss the pathophysiologic mechanisms.

Results

A 68-year-old male presented with classical signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism, including fatigue, confusion, and gait imbalance. Physical exam showed bradycardia, thyromegaly, slow mentation, and cracked, thin skin; he was found to have decreased kidney function. Second, a 42-year-old previously healthy female presented with bilateral hand swelling and elevated serum creatinine with an otherwise unremarkable physical exam. The third patient was a 72-year-old male with advanced heart failure on amiodarone and stage 3 chronic kidney disease who presented with fatigue, acute kidney injury, and lower extremity edema. In all cases, serum creatinine and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) were elevated at presentation (1.4–3.0 mg/dL and 94.1–184 mIU/L respectively), and free thyroxine (T4) was low (undetectable-0.4 ng/dL). The initiation or increased dose of levothyroxine normalized serum creatinine to baseline within 2 to 10 months.

Conclusion

Hypothyroidism and kidney dysfunction are both commonly encountered clinical entities, but the interplay between the thyroid gland and kidneys may be infrequently recalled, causing the reversible relationship between these 2 disorders to be missed.

### Myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest in a patient with severe undiagnosed hypothyroidism during bronchoscopy [^4a01dc6f]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Thyroid hormones have an integral role in cardiac homeostasis, and hypothyroidism may be associated with impaired myocardial contractility, altered endothelial function, and blunted response to catecholamines. Herein, the case of a patient with undiagnosed severe hypothyroidism, who developed an acute myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest during sedation for bronchoscopy, is described. He required prolonged resuscitation, which included coronary catheterization and placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump. The resuscitation was noteworthy for blunted physiologic responses to large doses of epinephrine; in particular, persistent bradycardia without evidence of conduction abnormalities. On admission to the intensive care unit, he was hypothermic (31.4°C), bradycardic, and hypotensive. Laboratory investigations revealed profound hypothyroidism, and thyroid hormone replacement was initiated. Within hours of initiation of thyroid hormone replacement, the need for vasopressor support was reduced. He had a complete recovery and was discharged home neurologically intact. The authors of the present report believe that this favorable neurologic outcome could be attributed to efficient resuscitation, prompt coronary revascularization, and profound hypothermia likely related to a hypothyroidism-associated hypometabolic state.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^38925abd]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Levothyroxine (LT4) replacement therapy — co-existent medical conditions: We recommend considering patients' underlying medical conditions (such as atherosclerotic heart disease) in order to establish realistic treatment goals and avoid exacerbation of underlying comorbidities. Weak recommendation. Low-quality evidence. Renal and liver disease. There are no adjustments in LT4 dosing that are required in cases of cirrhosis or renal failure. Nephrotic syndrome, with its large urinary protein losses that include the thyroid hormone transport proteins TBG, transthyretine and albumin, can be a cause of increased LT4 requirements due to excessive urinary thyroid hormone losses. Cardiac disease. Thyroid hormone therapy, with its inotropic and chronotropic effects on the heart, is a potential cause of angina in patients with severe CAD. This is the reason for starting patients with low doses of LT4, and increasing the dose slowly, while monitoring for the development of angina or other cardiac symptoms such as tachyarrhythmias. Gastrointestinal disease. See recommendation 3c for discussion of gastritis, celiac disease, and intestinal by-pass surgery.

### Evaluation and treatment of amiodarone-induced thyroid disorders [^f990649f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on amiodarone-induced thyroid disorders:

- **Definition**: Amiodarone, an iodinated benzofuran, is a potent antiarrhythmic medication that can alter thyroid hormone metabolism and may precipitate hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.
- **Pathophysiology**: Amiodarone-induced thyroid disorders are caused by either deiodination, which releases large amounts of iodine that can impair thyroid function, or by direct cytotoxicity on thyroid cells by amiodarone or its metabolite.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in patients taking amiodarone ranges from 5% to 14%.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for amiodarone-induced thyroid disorders include high cumulative doses of amiodarone, longer duration of treatment, a higher baseline TSH level, older age (particularly age ≥ 75 years), pre-existing thyroid disease (autonomous thyroid nodules or latent Graves' disease).
- **Disease course**: Amiodarone-associated hypothyroidism is similar to iodine-induced hypothyroidism and typically presents with symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. It can also lead to myxedema coma, severe bradycardia, prolonged atrioventricular conduction, peripheral edema, and severe muscle cramps. On the other hand, amiodarone-associated hyperthyroidism, or thyrotoxicosis, presents with symptoms such as weight loss, palpitations, heat intolerance, muscle weakness, anorexia, restlessness, tremor, and congestive HF.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of amiodarone-induced thyroid disorders is generally favorable. Most patients can recover thyroid function once amiodarone is stopped, but some may require long-term management due to persistent thyroid dysfunction.

### Potential therapeutic applications of thyroid hormone analogs [^9d5d2c70]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Medium credibility.

Thyroid hormone (T3 and T4) has many beneficial effects including enhancing cardiac function, promoting weight loss and reducing serum cholesterol. Excess thyroid hormone is, however, associated with unwanted effects on the heart, bone and skeletal muscle. We therefore need analogs that harness the beneficial effects of thyroid hormone without the untoward effects. Such work is largely based on understanding the cellular mechanisms of thyroid hormone action, specifically the crystal structure of the nuclear receptor proteins. In clinical studies, use of naturally occurring thyroid hormone analogs can suppress TSH levels in patients with thyroid cancer without producing tachycardia. Many thyromimetic compounds have been tested in animal models and shown to increase total body oxygen consumption, and to lower weight and serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels while having minor effects on heart rate. Alternatively, analogs that specifically enhance both systolic and diastolic function are potentially useful in the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure. In addition to analogs that are thyroid hormone receptor agonists, several compounds that are thyroid hormone receptor antagonists have been identified and tested. This Review discusses the potential application of thyroid hormone analogs (both agonists and antagonists) in a variety of human disease states.

### Sinus bradycardia in habitual cocaine users [^4520dcd7]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Common physiological manifestations of cocaine are related to its adrenergic effects, due to inhibition of dopamine and norepinephrine uptake at the postsynaptic terminal. Few studies have documented bradycardia secondary to cocaine use, representing the antithesis of its adrenergic effects. We assessed the prevalence of sinus bradycardia (SB) in habitual cocaine users and postulated a mechanism for this effect. One hundred sixty-two patients with a history of cocaine use were analyzed and compared with age- and gender-matched controls. SB was defined as a rate of < 60 beats/min and habitual cocaine use as 2 or more documented uses > 30 days apart. Propensity score-matching analysis was applied to balance covariates between cocaine users and nonusers and reduce selection bias. Patients with a history of bradycardia, hypothyroidism, or concomitant beta-blocker use were excluded. Mean age of study patients was 44 ± 8 years. SB was observed in 43 of 162 (27%) cocaine users and in 9 of 149 (6%) nonusers (p = 0.0001). Propensity score-matching analysis matched 218 patients from both groups. Among matched patients SB was observed in 25 of 109 (23%) cocaine users and in 5 of 109 (5%) nonusers (p = 0.0001). Habitual cocaine use was an independent predictor of SB and associated with a sevenfold increase in the risk of SB (95% CI 2.52 to 19.74, p = 0.0002). In conclusion, habitual cocaine use is a strong predictor of SB and was unrelated to recency of use. A potential mechanism for SB may be related to cocaine-induced desensitization of the beta-adrenergic receptor secondary to continuous exposure. Symptomatic SB was not observed; thus, pacemaker therapy was not indicated.

### Resistance to thyroid hormone induced tachycardia in RTH α syndrome [^6888505a]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

Current knowledge suggests that TH controls heart rate by regulating the expression of Hcn2 and Hcn4 pacemaker channel genes. Furthermore, given known similarities of features of hyperthyroidism or overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system, it is thought that TH controls heart rate by stimulation of the SNS. Prompted by clinical observations in patients with RTHα, our studies of TRα1 + m mutant mice at thermoneutrality (30 °C), where animals are not cold-stressed, and, as in humans, heart rate is predominantly controlled by parasympathetic activity, challenge both these assumptions.

It is recognized that TH acts indirectly, affecting efferent SNS output from the central nervous system via TRα1, to regulate metabolic activity in tissues like liver and brown adipose tissue - often in synergy with the direct peripheral actions of the hormone. Our observations suggest that this does not seem to be the case for heart rate, as we did not observe altered SNS activity in TRα1 mutant mice at thermoneutrality (30 °C) or following central, i.c.v. administration of T3. Furthermore, norepinephrine turnover, a marker of SNS activity in the heart, was not altered in T3-treated animals. Our findings are in good agreement with a previous study showing that the T3-induced tachycardia persisted in mice lacking all β-adrenergic receptors, and even earlier work showing no change in β-adrenergic responses in hyper- or hypothyroidism presumably due to intracardiac compensatory mechanisms. However, it is important to note that several previous studies in mice were conducted at room temperature (22 °C), with expression regulation of some genes by TH, including Adrb1, differing in this context. Coupled with the fact that the SNS is more active in mice at 22 °C, such complexities in the interplay between indirect SNS and direct cardiac actions of TH, may have led to an overestimation of the SNS contribution to specific phenotypes in animals studied at temperatures below thermoneutrality.

Finally, the effect of TSH incubation on the development of spontaneous contractions after interruption of electrical stimulation was tested in the absence and presence of the β-adrenoceptor agonist ISO. In the absence of the agonist, TSH-treated cells showed greater incidence of spontaneous activity after a brief (10 seconds) train of stimulation at all tested rates, from 0.5 to 2 Hz (Fig. 5C, left). Another stimulation protocol (1 Hz for 2 minutes) was used to test β-adrenergic stimulation with ISO. Although ISO was effective at inducing automatism in cells incubated with and without TSH (p < 0.001), the response was more prominent in the latter group (p < 0.05 for treatment × [ISO] interaction), in which the maximum rate of spontaneous events was twofold greater (Fig. 5C, right).

### Partial resistance to thyroid hormone-induced tachycardia and cardiac hypertrophy in mice lacking thyroid hormone receptor β [^243ba45a]. Thyroid (2024). Medium credibility.

Background: Thyroid hormones regulate cardiac functions mainly through direct actions in the heart and by binding to the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) isoforms α1 and β. While the role of the most abundantly expressed isoform, TRα1, is widely studied and well characterized, the role of TRβ in regulating heart functions is still poorly understood, primarily due to the accompanying elevation of circulating thyroid hormone in TRβ knockout mice (TRβ-KO). However, their hyperthyroidism is ameliorated at thermoneutrality, which allows studying the role of TRβ without this confounding factor. Methods: Here, we noninvasively monitored heart rate in TRβ-KO mice over several days using radiotelemetry at different housing temperatures (22°C and 30°C) and upon 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (T3) administration in comparison to wild-type animals. Results: TRβ-KO mice displayed normal average heart rate at both 22°C and 30°C with only minor changes in heart rate frequency distribution, which was confirmed by independent electrocardiogram recordings in freely-moving conscious mice. Parasympathetic nerve activity was, however, impaired in TRβ-KO mice at 22°C, and only partly rescued at 30°C. As expected, oral treatment with pharmacological doses of T3 at 30°C led to tachycardia in wild-types, accompanied by broader heart rate frequency distribution and increased heart weight. The TRβ-KO mice, in contrast, showed blunted tachycardia, as well as resistance to changes in heart rate frequency distribution and heart weight. At the molecular level, these observations were paralleled by a blunted cardiac mRNA induction of several important genes, including the pacemaker channels Hcn2 and Hcn4, as well as Kcna7. Conclusions: The phenotyping of TRβ-KO mice conducted at thermoneutrality allows novel insights on the role of TRβ in cardiac functions in the absence of the usual confounding hyperthyroidism. Even though TRβ is expressed at lower levels than TRα1 in the heart, our findings demonstrate an important role for this isoform in the cardiac response to thyroid hormones.

### Resistance to thyroid hormone induced tachycardia in RTH α syndrome [^87a06f0b]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

In contrast to the SNS, we observed a slight reduction in PSNS activity following T3 administration at 30 °C in both genotypes, reflecting lower vagal activity in hyperthyroidism as reported previously. Although reduced PSNS activity should result in elevation of heart rate, this was not observed in TRα1 + m mice suggesting that the hearts of these animals are less sensitive to altered PSNS activity. Furthermore, in denervation studies, TRα1 + m mice exhibited lower overall PSNS input — also a characteristic seen in hypothyroid patients. Nevertheless, our observation that no change in SNS or PSNS activity was seen following i.c.v administration of T3 in wild-type mice, suggests that the interaction between TH and the PSNS control of heart rate may be largely mediated at the level of cardiac signal transduction. Overall, our data suggest that the acute central autonomic effects of TH on average heart rate may be negligible, whilst T3 may still influence other cardiovascular parameters such as heart rate frequency distribution, as observed in an animal model of central hypothyroidism.

It has long been recognized that TH positively regulates expression of sinoatrial pacemaker channels Hcn2 and Hcn4, providing a potential molecular mechanism for the chronotropic effects of the hormone. However, our observations in T3-treated TRα1 + m mice at 30 °C, dissociate changes in expression of these genes from heart rate: whilst Hcn2 and Hcn4 expression was strongly induced as expected, the animals remained bradycardic with no change in heart rate following T3 administration, indicating that neither Hcn2 nor Hcn4 were determinants of this. Our observations are supported by recent animal studies, showing that Hcn2 knockout mice exhibit normal heart rate. Likewise, many inducible, cardiac-specific Hcn4 knockout models also showed normal heart rate, although these findings are somewhat controversial. Accordingly, it is hypothesised that rather than controlling pacemaker activity, these Hcn channels function to stabilize heart rate and integrate autonomic signals, with increased sensitivity to PSNS activity seen in an inducible Hcn4 knockout model supporting this notion. It is therefore tempting to speculate that the observed T3 effects on Hcn2 and/or Hcn4 expression rather mediate altered PSNS responses seen in hyperthyroid animals.

### Is there a causal relationship between hypothyroidism and hyponatremia? [^68039653]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Mechanisms

Several different mechanisms have been thought to explain the association between hypothyroidism and hyponatremia (Figure 1). Changes in vasopressin leading to impaired water excretion are postulated to be one of the primary mechanisms. The trigger for the release of vasopressin has been hypothesized to occur in multiple ways. Hypothyroidism leads to decreased cardiac output and increased peripheral vascular resistance. The decrease in cardiac output is thought to cause baroreceptor-mediated release of vasopressin. Hypothyroidism also results in the accumulation of interstitial mucopolysaccharides, which leads to decreased effective arterial blood volume and the release of vasopressin. Increased vasopressin results in increased free water absorption. Impaired urinary dilution may also occur through an upregulation of renal aquaporin 2 channels. Studies examining vasopressin levels in patients with hypothyroidism have been conflicting. In a study of 20 patients with severe hypothyroidism, vasopressin was shown to be elevated at baseline. In addition, in 75% of participants, vasopressin failed to suppress with water ingestion. However, in a study of eight patients with severe hypothyroidism, the hypothyroid patients had a significantly lower plasma vasopressin levels compared to normal controls. In this study, all subjects had a normal or subnormal rise in vasopressin in response to hypertonic saline infusion. Therefore, the impaired water excretion observed in hypothyroidism may also occur via vasopressin-independent processes.

Figure 1.
Proposed mechanisms for hypothyroidism-induced hyponatremia.

The kidney plays a key role in the water and sodium homeostasis. In hypothyroidism, decreased cardiac output leads to decreased renal blood flow and reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Tubular sodium and water excretion were similar in hypothyroid patients compared to those with a similar degree of renal insufficiency. Therefore, the changes observed may be a consequence of the reduction in GFR. In addition, hypothyroidism causes decreased Na-K-ATPase pump activity in the kidney with a reduction in tubular sodium reabsorption. All these changes ultimately contribute to water retention and altered sodium handling leading to hyponatremia. Many questions remain with regard to the pathophysiologic link between hypothyroidism and hyponatremia.

### 2017 guidelines of the American Thyroid Association for the diagnosis and management of thyroid disease during pregnancy and the postpartum [^113a30cb]. Thyroid (2017). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Hashimoto's thyroiditis:

- **Definition**: HT, also known as chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis and autoimmune thyroiditis, is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation of the thyroid gland, leading to its gradual destruction and hypothyroidism.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of HT involves progressiveimmune-mediated destruction of the thyroid gland, driven by genetic susceptibility and environmental factors. Infiltration by T and B lymphocytes and the production of anti-TPO and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies contribute to follicular damage and impaired hormone synthesis, ultimately leading to hypothyroidism. Histologic findings include parenchymal atrophy, lymphoid follicles with germinal centers, fibrosis, and Hurthle cell metaplasia.
- Epidemiology: HT is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient regions. The annual incidence is estimated at 0.3–1.5 cases per 1,000 individuals. Global adult prevalence is approximately 7.5%, with rates of 17.5% in women and 6.0% in men. It predominantly affects women, with a female-to-male ratio of 10:1, and is most commonly diagnosed between ages 30–50.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors include female sex, advancing age, personal or family history of autoimmune disease, genetic predisposition involving HLA-DR and CTLA-4 polymorphisms, high iodine intake, exposure to radiation, an d certain medications (such as interferon-alpha, amiodarone) and medical treatments (such as radioactive iodine therapy for hyperthyroidism, external beam radiation therapy for head and neck malignancies, and thyroid surgery). Some infections and environmental stressors may also contribute.
- **Disease course**: HT is a chronic and progressive condition, with many patients remaining asymptomatic and euthyroid for years before developing overt hypothyroidism. Some experience phases of subclinical hypothyroidism. Progression to hypothyroidism is more likely in patients with high antibody titers or TSH elevation at presentation. When symptoms occur, they are usually related to hypothyroidism and include fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, bradycardia, dry skin, and depression. A painless, diffusely enlarged thyroid (goiter) may be present. In some cases, transient hyperthyroidism may occur due to follicular rupture and hormone release. Related risks and complications include infertility, miscarriage, myxedema, hyperlipidemia, and cardiovascular risk due to untreated hypothyroidism. There is a small increased risk of thyroid lymphoma. Goitrous enlargement may cause compressive symptoms in rare cases.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: With appropriate treatment, prognosis is excellent. Most patients on levothyroxine remain euthyroid and symptomatically well. However, long-term monitoring is needed, as dosage adjustments may be required over time due to progression or other factors such as weight changes or pregnancy.

### Effects of subclinical thyroid dysfunction on the heart [^c1e4a09d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Mounting evidence indicates that subclinical thyroid dysfunction has important clinical effects and prognostic implications, supporting the view that it is not a compensated biochemical change sensu strictu.

Purpose

To review clinical information on the effects of subclinical thyroid dysfunction on the heart.

Data Sources

English-language articles identified from files and a MEDLINE search (1970-September 2001), references of relevant articles, textbooks, and meeting abstracts.

Study Selection

Reports on the effects of subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism on the cardiovascular system in humans.

Data Extraction

Data on cardiac structure and performance, arrhythmias, and risk for coronary artery disease were independently assessed by all authors and summarized.

Data Synthesis

Subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with impaired left ventricular diastolic function at rest, systolic dysfunction on effort, and enhanced risk for atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with increased heart rate, atrial arrhythmias, increased left ventricular mass with marginal concentric remodeling, impaired ventricular relaxation, reduced exercise performance, and increased risk for cardiovascular death. All abnormalities were reversed by restoration of euthyroidism (subclinical hypothyroidism) or were blunted by beta-blockade and tailoring of the l -thyroxine dose (subclinical hyperthyroidism).

Conclusion

The heart responds to the minimal but persistent changes in circulating thyroid hormone levels typical of subclinical thyroid dysfunction. Thus, the condition is not a compensated biochemical change sensu strictu, and timely treatment should be considered in an attempt to avoid adverse cardiovascular effects.

### 2023 HRS expert consensus statement on the management of arrhythmias during pregnancy [^8db41672]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

HRS 2023 — fetal bradycardia overview defines fetal bradycardia and emphasizes monitoring and individualized decision-making. The etiologies of fetal bradycardia (defined as fetal heart rate < 110 bpm or less than the third percentile corrected for gestational age) encompass several different mechanisms including SHD, conduction system disturbances manifesting as variable degrees of heart block, and IAS. In fetuses with bradycardia, serial sonographic monitoring of fetal status is crucial to identify and treat the development of cardiomyopathy and/or fetal hydrops. Autoimmune-induced heart block and cardiomyopathy may be amenable to antenatal interventions such as maternal steroid administration; however, the benefit of this therapy is uncertain, and its use requires patient-specific shared decision-making between the patient and the cardio-obstetrics team. Pregnancies with idiopathic fetal bradycardia may suggest an IAS, and prenatal and postnatal evaluation to diagnose or rule out IAS is warranted.

### High thyrotropin is critical for cardiac electrical remodeling and arrhythmia vulnerability in hypothyroidism [^89b2e833]. Thyroid (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Recent studies highlight the importance of thyrotropin (TSH) levels in the mortality of both hypothyroid and euthyroid individuals. Patients with treated overt hypothyroidism with serum TSH levels between 0.5 and 5 mIU/L have significantly lower mortality rates than patients with TSH levels between 5 and 10 mIU/L. Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that high-normal TSH levels are associated with higher mortality than mid-normal levels in non-hypothyroid individuals, but the mechanisms responsible for this elevated mortality are unknown.

In this context, it has been reported that hypothyroid patients show electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities such as atrial fibrillation, prolonged QT and QTc intervals, and greater QT dispersion. This electrical remodeling creates a pro-arrhythmic substrate and facilitates the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias including torsades de pointes. Surprisingly, patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, with normal triiodothyronine (T3)/thyroxine (T4) levels but elevated TSH, show similar repolarization alterations in the ECG as those with overt hypothyroidism, suggesting the involvement of TSH in cardiac electrical remodeling and arrhythmia. In the last decade, clinical observations have shown a direct correlation between serum TSH levels and QT/QTc prolongation in hypothyroid patients. In agreement with this hypothesis, it was recently reported that in vitro treatment of healthy cardiac myocytes with TSH decreases the amplitude of different repolarizing K + currents and the expression of their channel proteins.

This study used animal models of primary (high TSH) and central (low TSH) hypothyroidism, as well as adult human atrial myocytes and computational modeling, to gain insight into the mechanisms underlying myocardial electrical remodeling by TSH. The results presented here suggest that the cardiac electrical remodeling and enhanced arrhythmia susceptibility in primary hypothyroidism under adrenergic stimulation are due to: (i) an increase of the depolarizing inward calcium current secondary to the reduction of thyroid hormone levels; (ii) a TSH receptor/protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent reduction of the expression of the pore-forming proteins of the channels that carry the repolarizing outward potassium currents I to and I Ks; and (iii) the appearance of early afterdepolarizations (EAD) and arrhythmias secondary to prolongation of repolarization, especially under β-adrenergic stimulation. In summary, this work demonstrates the direct involvement of TSH in the cardiac electrical remodeling and arrhythmia predisposition seen in hypothyroidism.

### Thyroid and the heart [^23a092d6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Thyroid hormones modulate every component of the cardiovascular system necessary for normal cardiovascular development and function. When cardiovascular disease is present, thyroid function tests are characteristically indicated to determine if overt thyroid disorders or even subclinical dysfunction exists. As hypothyroidism, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease all increase with advancing age, monitoring of thyroid-stimulating hormone, the most sensitive test for hypothyroidism, is important in this expanding segment of our population. A better understanding of the impact of thyroid hormonal status on cardiovascular physiology will enable health care providers to make decisions about thyroid hormone evaluation and therapy in concert with evaluating and treating hypertension and cardiovascular disease. The goal of this review is to access contemporary understanding of the effects of thyroid hormones on normal cardiovascular function and the potential role of overt and subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism in a variety of cardiovascular diseases.

### Resistance to thyroid hormone induced tachycardia in RTH α syndrome [^88ace581]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

At the molecular level, the effects of TH on duration of ventricular action potential have been associated with regulation of several potassium channels including Kcnd2 or Kcna5 by T3. Likewise, thyroid hormone also affects cardiac contraction and relaxation speed by modulating calcium flux between cytosol and sarcoplasmic reticulum, altering Atp2a2 and Ryr2 gene expression. However, our observations in TRα1 + m animals studied at thermoneutrality, indicate that expression of these genes (together with delayed rectifier channels e.g. Kcnh2) is irreversibly reduced and not fully T3 inducible. This indicates that the effects of TH on action potential duration are complex, with a combination of irreversible, developmentally programmed, effects and preserved acute responses to hormone (e.g. T3-mediated repression of Kcne1 via TRα1). Overall, our microarray expression profiling data, obtained in animals studied at thermoneutrality thereby obviating confounding effects of cold stress or SNS hyperactivity, provide a unique and comprehensive roadmap for future studies to dissect the effects of TH on cardiovascular function.

Based on the finding that the expression of several genes was permanently altered in TRα1 + m mice and not restored by receptor reactivation, we hypothesised that their expression had been developmentally reprogrammed by altered DNA methylation — an epigenetic effect of maternal TH that has been observed previously in other tissues. Indeed, our observations indicate that several clusters of CpG sites are differentially methylated in TRα1 + m mice, with maternal T3 treatment normalising these differences. Combining our transcriptome and methylome observations, Ryr2 emerged as the most promising candidate, as its reduced expression in TRα1 + m mice is rescued by maternal T3 exposure but not by treating adult mutant mice. Congruent with this finding, CpG methylation at a site within the Ryr2 gene was higher in TRα1 + m mice, with maternal T3 treatment reversing this. Notably, Ryr2 is strongly linked to heart rate, as it encodes the ryanodine receptor 2, which governs the release of calcium from sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol, triggering cardiac muscle contraction. Mice with an inducible, conditional knockout which reduces cardiac Ryr2 expression by 50% developed bradycardia, indicating that reduced expression of this gene is sufficient by itself to cause the observed cardiac phenotype. However, the exact contribution of this particular gene in the context of several other pathways that are also altered in TRα1 + m heart, remains to be established. Furthermore, additional studies to link methylation status of this specific CpG site in Ryr2 to altered expression of this gene, are needed.

### Association of thyroid hormone treatment intensity with cardiovascular mortality… [^65bd4cb6]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance This study suggests that both exogenous hyperthyroidism and exogenous hypothyroidism were associated with increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. These findings emphasize the importance of maintaining euthyroidism to decrease cardiovascular risk and death among patients receiving thyroid hormone treatment. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between the intensity of thyroid hormone treatment and cardiovascular mortality using a nationwide, population-based cohort of adults receiving thyroid hormone treatment. We hypothesized that both exogenous hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism would be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality, even when adjusting for age, sex, and traditional cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension and smoking. defined by thyrotropin levels from 0. 5 to
5. 5 mIU/L and FT4 levels from 0. 7 to

1. 9 ng/dL; and exogenous hypothyroidism was defined by thyrotropin levels higher than 5.

5 mIU/L or by FT4 levels lower than
0. 7 ng/dL. In this population-based study of a large cohort of adults receiving thyroid hormone treatment, we found that the intensity of thyroid hormone treatment was associated with cardiovascular mortality. Both exogenous hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism were associated with increased risk of cardiovascular mortality, even when adjusting for relevant demographic and traditional cardiovascular risk factors as well as previous history of cardiovascular disease and/or arrhythmia. In addition, our findings suggest that the risk of cardiovascular mortality is directly associated with the degree of thyrotropin abnormality outside the euthyroid range, such that thyrotropin levels lower than 0. 1 mIU/L and higher than 20 mIU/L were associated with the highest increased risk.

In this population-based cohort of patients receiving thyroid hormone treatment, we found that both exogenous hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism were associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality after adjusting for a comprehensive set of demographic and traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States, and its economic impact is enormous. Identifying and addressing modifiable risk factors continues to be critically important to reducing the rates of cardiovascular disease and mortality. The emergence of the intensity of thyroid hormone treatment as a potential associated risk factor provides a highly relevant and easily modifiable clinical parameter for patients who receive thyroid hormone treatment.

### Thyrotoxicosis [^da3b3d1a]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism is a diagnosis existing along a spectrum of severity. Patients present with a variety of signs and symptoms: tachycardia, elevated heart rate, anxiety, changes in mental status, gastrointestinal disturbances, and hyperthermia. Management of subclinical hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis without thyroid storm is heavily dependent on outpatient evaluation. Thyroid storm is the most severe form of hyperthyroidism with the highest mortality. Management of thyroid storm follows a stepwise approach, with resuscitation and detection of the precipitating cause being paramount. Special attention should be paid to cardiac function in patients with thyroid storm before treatment, as these patients may develop cardiac collapse.

### Thyroid and cardiovascular disease: research agenda for enhancing knowledge, prevention, and treatment [^f5138666]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Thyroid hormones have long been known to have a range of effects on the cardiovascular system. However, significant knowledge gaps exist concerning the precise molecular and biochemical mechanisms governing these effects and the optimal strategies for management of abnormalities in thyroid function in patients with and without preexisting cardiovascular disease. In September 2017, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened a Working Group with the goal of developing priorities for future scientific research relating thyroid dysfunction to the progression of cardiovascular disease. The Working Group reviewed and discussed the roles of normal thyroid physiology, the consequences of thyroid dysfunction, and the effects of therapy in 3 cardiovascular areas: cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmias, the vasculature and atherosclerosis, and the myocardium and heart failure. This report describes the current state of the field, outlines barriers and challenges to progress, and proposes research opportunities to advance the field, including strategies for leveraging novel approaches using omics and big data. The Working Group recommended research in 3 broad areas: (1) investigation into the fundamental biology relating thyroid dysfunction to the development of cardiovascular disease and into the identification of novel biomarkers of thyroid hormone action in cardiovascular tissues; (2) studies that define subgroups of patients with thyroid dysfunction amenable to specific preventive strategies and interventional therapies related to cardiovascular disease; and (3) clinical trials focused on improvement in cardiovascular performance and cardiovascular outcomes through treatment with thyroid hormone or thyromimetic drugs.

### Sudden cardiac arrest associated with myxedema coma due to undiagnosed hypothyroidism: a case report [^f3616886]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Several factors precipitating myxedema coma have been revealed, such as infection, myocardial infarction (MI), cold exposure, surgery, and the administration of sedative drugs. Amiodarone also has a complex effect on the thyroid gland because its structure is similar to that of thyroid hormones. In this case, fT3 levels were slightly lower, and TSH levels were higher after amiodarone administration for VT; consequently, the dose of LT3/LT4 needed to be increased. As a consequence, physicians should be cautious of certain drugs leading to thyroid dysfunction when managing patients with a myxedema coma.

Owing to the rarity of this condition, the recommended strategy of thyroid hormone replacement therapy remains unclear; thus, it has merely been based on expert opinions and case reports. In Japan, patients with myxedema coma are commonly treated with LT4, with or without LT3.

Thyroid hormones have many effects on the heart and the vascular system. The most common signs of hypothyroidism are bradycardia, mild hypertension, narrowed pulse pressure, and attenuated activity on precordial examination. Low cardiac output is caused by bradycardia, decreased ventricular filling, and decreased cardiac contractility. Systemic vascular resistance may increase by 50%, and diastolic relaxation and filling are slowed. However, heart failure is rare because cardiac output is usually sufficient to meet the lower demand for peripheral oxygen delivery. Hypothyroidism may result in accelerated atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease, presumably because of the associated hypercholesterolemia and hypertension.

In this case, the patient had prolonged undiagnosed severe hypothyroidism, which favored several risk factors for cardiac events. On the admission day, MI was expected to occur, precipitating myxedema coma in the patient. Consequently, hemodynamics may have deteriorated, leading to an episode of cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA). Fortunately, the patient's general condition, including her hemodynamic status, improved remarkably with thyroid hormone replacement therapy regardless of the use of amiodarone for VT. Unfortunately, the patient's neurological dysfunction did not recover.

In conclusion, this case presents the clinical course of CPA caused by undiagnosed myxedema coma; this condition is characterized by unique findings on physical examination. Our findings are useful for the differential diagnosis of hypothyroidism, especially a diagnosis based on characteristic physical examination findings, in the emergency department.

Clinicians should be aware of the differential diagnosis of myxedema coma based on findings from physical examination and laboratory testing of thyroid function, and the treatment should be started immediately to prevent the occurrence of complications.

### When an ICD is not the answer… hypothyroidism-induced cardiomyopathy and torsades de pointes [^4cd7bed1]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

An increasing number of patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction are referred for placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).

Case Report

A 78-year-old female with fatigue, palpitations, and presyncope was referred for consideration of an ICD because of a cardiomyopathy and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). Her evaluation revealed severe hypothyroidism, marked QT prolongation, and episodes of torsades de pointes. With levothyroxine therapy, her ventricular arrhythmias rapidly abated, with subsequent normalization of LV function and the QT interval.

Conclusions

This report highlights the critical importance of detecting hypothyroidism as an unusual cause for reversible cardiomyopathy and ventricular arrhythmias.

Selective thyromimetics have been designed and shown to exhibit some of the beneficial effects of thyroid hormones, such as lowering of cholesterol and weight reduction, without the adverse thyroid hormone action on muscle, bone, and heart rate. Progress has also been made in attempting to treat hyperthyroidism by synthesizing antagonists that block thyroid hormone action, at the level of the thyroid hormone receptor or of the thyrotropin receptor. Clinical trials are still awaited, however, to verify whether these potentially promising agents will indeed prove to be of clinical therapeutic value.

Thyroid hormone acting on blood pressure

THs act on the vasculature and in the heart by TR-mediated gene regulation in the nucleus and also via other non-classical pathways at the cytoplasmatic and cellular membrane levels.

In myocytes, and also in vasculature, THs, especially T3 with greater affinity, bind to TH nuclear receptors in its two isoforms, TRα and TRβ. Thereafter, the complex formed by TH response elements at the promoter regions of specific responsive genes lead to positive or negative regulation of several genes enrolled in cardiac function and vascular resistance. The sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA2), the myosine-have chains-α (αMHC), the Na + /K + ATPase, the voltage-gated K + channels, the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT1) and the β-adrenergic receptor are positively regulated by THs. In opposite, the myosine-have chains-β (βMHC), the phospholamban, the Na + /Ca 2+ exchanger (NCX1), the TRα1, adenylyl cyclase (types V, VI) and TH transporters 8 and 10 are negatively regulated by THs.

Additionally to genomic effects of TH on cardiac myocytes, and also on vasculature, there are important and faster non-genomic actions, like those related to direct modulation of membrane ion channels.

THs have important inotropic and chronotropic effects on the heart and concomitantly, they cause vasodilatation in the systemic circulation, leading to a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. Hyperthyroid patients exhibit tachycardia, increased heart contractility, and decreased cardiac after-load, resulting in increased cardiac output, which leads to systolic hypertension. Hypothyroid patients may exhibit diastolic hypertension, associated with impaired endothelial-dependent vasodilatation. Alterations in the microcirculation of hypothyroid patients have also been reported, such as a decrease in blood-flow velocity and impaired vasodilation after a short period of ischemia. The mechanism involves TH stimulation of nitric oxide production and regulation of other local regulatory factors, resulting in a decrease in vascular smooth muscular tone. –

In addition, TH actions in the central nervous system have an influence on autonomic regulation of BP. Recently, a group of parvalbuminergic neurons at the anterior hypothalamus, which act to decrease BP, was described, and their development appears to be dependent on TRα signaling. This finding may explain the hypotension present in patients with TRα mutations. Different from peripheral systemic vasculature, the pulmonary vasculature does not respond to the vasodilator effect of TH and may explain reversible pulmonary hypertension related to hyperthyroidism.

Results

Animal models

Although PTU treatment is a widely used procedure for induction of primary hypothyroidism, to the best of the authors' knowledge, an animal model of central hypothyroidism had not yet been developed. The anticancer drug BXT exerts a direct inhibitory effect on the TSH-producing cells of the pituitary gland. Advantage was taken of this unwanted side effect to create a central hypothyroidism experimental model, which was tested in this study.

Both PTU and BXT treatments reduced blood T4 concentration within one week, attaining almost undetectable levels after two weeks (Fig. 1A). Since PTU directly induces malfunction of the thyroid gland, blood TSH concentration showed a 10-fold increase, reaching its maximum at week 4. BXT, on the other hand, is expected to reduce T4 levels due to its toxic effect on the pituitary gland. Accordingly, TSH levels were reduced, reaching the minimum at week 4 (Fig. 1B).

FIG. 1.
Characterization of the hypothyroidism animal models. (A) Free thyroxine (T4) blood levels are almost undetectable after two weeks of either primary or central hypothyroidism. (B) Serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels were increased more than 10-fold in primary hypothyroidism but were undetectable in animals with central hypothyroidism. (C) Thyroid gland weight showed opposite changes in primary and central hypothyroidism after six weeks of induction. (D) Hematoxylin and eosin stained sections of the thyroid gland six weeks after induction of primary (pHT) and central hypothyroidism (cHT) also show opposite structural modifications. Scale bars indicate 200 μm and 100 × μm at 20 × and 40 ×, respectively. n = 18 control, 15 pHT, and 17 cHT animals. Means ± standard error of the mean (SEM). ✱ p < 0.05; p < 0.01.

After six weeks of primary hypothyroidism, the high circulating TSH levels induced thyroid growth with an increase in epithelial cell height, whereas in low TSH central hypothyroidism, gland size and follicular cells height were slightly reduced (Fig. 1C and D and Supplementary Fig. 1A). Primary hypothyroidism reduced body weight, which was not changed in control or centrally hypothyroid animals. Neither body temperature nor relative heart mass was significantly different among the three groups of animals (Supplementary Fig. 1B–D).

### Hypothyroidism: a review [^f48dd54f]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hypothyroidism is a disease of thyroid hormone deficiency. The prevalence ranges from 0.3% to 12% worldwide, depending on iodine intake, and it is more common in women and older adults. Untreated hypothyroidism can cause serious health complications such as heart failure and myxedema coma.

Observations

Hashimoto thyroiditis (an autoimmune disease) is the cause of primary hypothyroidism in up to 85% of patients with hypothyroidism living in areas with adequate nutritional iodine levels. The risk of developing hypothyroidism is associated with genetic factors (having a first-degree relative with hypothyroidism), environmental factors (iodine deficiency), undergoing neck surgery or receiving radiation therapy, pregnancy in the setting of underlying autoimmune thyroid disease, and with the use of certain medications (eg, immune checkpoint inhibitors and amiodarone). Patients with hypothyroidism may have nonspecific symptoms due to metabolic slowing, including fatigue (68%-83%), weight gain (24%-59%), cognitive issues (45%-48%) such as memory loss and difficulty concentrating, and menstrual irregularities (approximately 23%) such as oligomenorrhea and menorrhagia. Hypothyroidism can cause insulin resistance and hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes, increase the risk for cardiovascular events, such as heart failure, and negatively affect female reproductive health, causing disrupted ovulation, infertility, and increased risk of miscarriage. Untreated hypothyroidism may progress to severe hypothyroidism with decompensation (myxedema coma), which is a condition associated with hypothermia, hypotension, and altered mental status that requires treatment in an intensive care unit and has a mortality rate of up to 30%. Hypothyroidism is diagnosed based on biochemical testing; a high thyrotropin (TSH) level and a low free thyroxine (T4) level indicate overt primary hypothyroidism. Screening for hypothyroidism is not recommended for asymptomatic individuals. Targeted testing is recommended for patients who are considered high risk (eg, patients with type 1 diabetes). First-line treatment for hypothyroidism is synthetic levothyroxine to normalize thyrotropin levels. Initial dosages should be tailored to patient-specific factors. Lower starting doses should be used for older patients or those with atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. Thyrotropin monitoring should be performed 6 to 8 weeks after initiating levothyroxine treatment, or when changing the dose, and then annually once the thyrotropin level is at goal to avoid overtreatment or undertreatment, both of which are associated with cardiovascular health risks.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hypothyroidism may be associated with fatigue, weight gain, memory loss, difficulty concentrating, cardiovascular disease such as heart failure, menstrual irregularities, infertility, and increased risk of miscarriage. Levothyroxine is the first-line treatment to normalize the thyrotropin level and improve clinical manifestations due to hypothyroidism.

### Wasting syndrome with deep bradycardia as presenting manifestation of long-standing severe male hypogonadotropic hypogonadism: a case series [^263f0c0a]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

In both cases, gonadal failure had a pituitary origin not associated with organic lesions; nonetheless, the screening for mutations of genes involved in hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism was negative.

At the presentation in both patients hypogonadotropic hypogonadism was associated with low IGF1 and low freeT4 levels associated with mildly elevated TSH levels. Thyroid autoimmunity and goiter were absent. On serum samples, the diagnosis of central hypothyroidism is usually suggested by the finding of low freeT4 concentrations associated with low/normal TSH levels. Nevertheless, some central hypothyroid patients have high serum immunoreactive TSH levels but are devoid of full biological activity. In these cases, TSH elevations are similar to those generally found in subclinical or mild primary hypothyroidism and may lead to the misdiagnosis. Nonetheless, differential diagnosis of central hypothyroidism includes non-thyroidal illness syndrome, which occurs in the presence of comorbidities. Patients with non-thyroidal illness syndrome have values of thyroid function testing that largely overlap with those with central hypothyroidism. Considering the outcomes of the two cases, Case 1 was diagnosed with central hypothyroidism, while Case 2 findings were consistent with non-thyroidal illness syndrome due to detrimental hypogonadism. A similar pattern of presentation was observed for GH secretion. Supporting the pituitary origin of the hormonal deficiency in Case 1, mild hyperprolactinemia, usually seen in pituitary defects and secondary to the hypothalamic thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation, was detected.

Though the effect of central hypothyroidism on cardiac presentation could not be ruled out in these patients, the mild freeT3 reduction and the recovery of euthyroidism in the Case 2 supported a dominant role of long-standing gonadic failure rather than hypothyroidism in determining the clinical presentation. It is worth noting that in the Case 1, GH and TSH deficiencies were likely to become manifest later than hypogonadism as the patient had been previously diagnosed with isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and no growth failure or short stature were detected.

The impact of testosterone on the cardiovascular system is controversial. Nonetheless, testosterone seems to be beneficial to the heart and low levels of testosterone negatively affect cardiovascular system. Moreover, testosterone has been shown to exhibit potential antiarrhythmic properties in the form of decreasing action potential duration and shortened QTc interval and low levels of testosterone in obese men have been suggested to contribute to their arrhythmogenic profile.

### Hypothyroid-induced hyponatraemia in a premature infant with a false-negative newborn screening for congenital hypothyroidism [^0901fe2a]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Summary

Worldwide newborn screening (NBS) programmes detect one in 2000–4000 newborns with forms of congenital hypothyroidism (CH). However, some newborns such as premature born babies, are at increased risk for a false-negative test result caused by delayed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) elevation through an immature hypothalamic-pituitary axis. We report a case of a premature newborn in which CH remained undetected. At the age of 3 months cardiorespiratory incidents increased, bradycardia, hypothermia and seizures developed. Investigation revealed severe hypotonic hyponatraemia (85 mmol/L), severe CH (TSH 300 mIU/L, free T4 2 pmol/L), renal insufficiency and metabolic acidosis. High urine osmolality, low urine sodium concentration and an extremely activated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system suggested a low effective circulating volume. This case report describes hypothyroid-induced hyponatraemia in a premature newborn with a false-negative NBS and thus re-emphasises the importance of repeat screening or repeat thyroid function testing for CH in premature newborns.

### Association of endocrine conditions with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy: a comprehensive review [^46a6999d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The thyroid and adrenergic systems are closely linked, and hyperthyroid states indeed resemble hyperadrenergic states. It is suggested that thyroid hormones potentiate the actions of normal levels of catecholamines and result in exaggerated inotropic and chronotropic effects (Figure 2). Findings of upregulation of β‐adrenergic receptors in the heart support this notion, although this is not always accompanied by simultaneous cardiac sensitivity to catecholamines. 74 Some studies have documented low‐to‐normal catecholamine levels in hyperthyroid states. 75 Animal studies have shown an intact cardiovascular response to hyperthyroidism even when all 3 β‐adrenergic receptors were blocked. 76 This raises the possibility of a mechanism other than an adrenergic‐mediated one. Some reports suggest that epicardial arterial spasm may occur, resulting in vasospastic angina, while others have hypothesized a critical imbalance of myocardial oxygen supply and demand exclusive of coronary spasm or coronary artery disease. 77, 78, 79

TCMP has also been documented to occur in patients with hypothyroid or subclinical hypothyroid states. 60, 80 In a retrospective study, Aggarwal et al found an association of TCMP with thyroid disorders and reported 35% of the patients to be hypothyroid, with the majority of them being on thyroid replacement and 11.36% being in a hyperthyroid state. 80 However, it is unclear whether the pathogenesis is solely related to the thyroid functional state or if other confounding variables are involved. 79, 80 Studies have reported alterations of the autonomic nervous system in patients with hypothyroidism, resulting in an imbalance of vagal and sympathetic modulation (Figure 2). 81, 82, 83 Moreover, the hypothyroid state is known to increase the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events, increase peripheral resistance, and reduce ventricular function. 74 Proper interpretation of thyroid function testing in the context of the clinical picture is important because patients with Graves disease can present as hyperthyroid or hypothyroid at different times, depending on the ratio of stimulating and blocking thyroid antibodies, commonly described as the "thyroid yo‐yo". 84, 85 Also, it should be noted that not all patients with Graves disease actually have thyroid antibodies. Moreover, thyroid tracer uptake may be suppressed in patients on treatment, although increased uptake is expected in Graves disease. 86

Larger studies are needed to better understand the potential association between thyroid disorders and TCMP. In the interim, physicians should be aware of this potential relationship and consider ordering appropriate thyroid function testing in the relevant clinical setting to facilitate prompt diagnosis and treatment.

5.1 QTc Prolongation

SIRTURO prolongs the QTc interval [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Use with drugs that prolong the QTc interval may cause additive QTc prolongation [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. In Study 4, where SIRTURO was administered with the QTc prolonging drugs clofazimine and levofloxacin, 5% of patients in the 40-week SIRTURO treatment group experienced a QTc ≥ 500 ms and 43% of patients experienced an increase in QTc ≥ 60 ms over baseline. Of the clofazimine- and levofloxacin-treated patients in the 40-week control arm, 7% of patients experienced a QTc ≥ 500 ms and 39% experienced an increase in QTc ≥ 60 ms over baseline.

Obtain an ECG before initiation of treatment, 2 weeks after initiation, during treatment, as clinically indicated and at the expected time of maximum increase in the QTc interval of the concomitantly administered QTc prolonging drugs (as applicable). Obtain electrolytes at baseline and during treatment and correct electrolytes as clinically indicated.

The following may increase the risk for QTc prolongation when patients are taking SIRTURO:

use with other QTc prolonging drugs
a history of Torsade de Pointes
a history of congenital long QTc syndrome
a history of or ongoing hypothyroidism
a history of or ongoing bradyarrhythmias
a history of uncompensated heart failure
serum calcium, magnesium, or potassium levels below the lower limits of normal

Discontinue SIRTURO if the patient develops:

Clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia
A QTc interval of greater than 500 ms (confirmed by repeat ECG)

If syncope occurs, obtain an ECG to detect QTc prolongation.

4.5 Treatment

Most individuals with RTHβ are asymptomatic not requiring specific treatment. Autonomic manifestations of hyperthyroidism (e.g. anxiety and palpitations) are responsive to beta‐blockade, with such therapy not affecting growth in childhood. A minority of patients experience more significant symptoms due to exposure of TRα‐expressing tissues to elevated circulating TH, including symptomatic tachycardia or persistent atrial fibrillation and impaired cardiac function, failure to thrive (infancy) and difficulty maintaining weight (adulthood) and anxiety or hyperactivity. In such cases, lowering TH levels may be helpful; options to achieve this include use of TRIAC (triiodothyroacetic acid, a TH analogue that preferentially acts centrally to inhibit TSH secretion, thereby lowering TH) or antithyroid drug (ATD) treatment. As therapy with ATDs results in a significant rise in TSH, driving goitre formation, potentially overcoming their inhibitory effect on TH synthesis and causing pituitary thyrotroph hyperplasia, our preference is to treat with TRIAC in the first instance, adding ATDs later if TRIAC alone is not sufficient to control symptoms. Total thyroidectomy or radioiodine treatment should be reserved as a last resort; following such thyroid ablation, thyroxine therapy in markedly supraphysiological dosage is required to normalise TSH levels, resulting in hyperthyroxinaemia of similar magnitude to before such interventions.

All patients with RTHβ should be followed long term, with suggested annual surveillance of adults including clinical assessment of symptoms, cardiovascular and thyroid examination and measurement of thyroid function and autoantibodies, fasting glucose and lipids. Cardiac telemetry may be warranted in cases with significant change in character or frequency of palpitations. Monitoring of bone health with periodic DXA scans and reviewing fracture history is also recommended. In children, autonomic and cardiac, thyrotoxic, symptoms, hyperactivity and educational performance, growth, goitre size and bone age should be monitored.

4.6 Resistance to thyroid Hormone α (RTHα)

Although α and β TH receptors are highly homologous, the equivalent human disorder (Resistance to thyroid Hormone α, RTHα), eludes diagnosis because it comprises many features of hypothyroidism in specific tissues, but associated with near‐normal thyroid function tests.

### Association of subclinical hypothyroidism and cardiovascular disease with mortality… [^a35d5a21]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance In this study, CVD mediated the associations of subclinical hypothyroidism and high-normal TSH concentrations with all-cause mortality in the US general population. Further studies are needed to examine the clinical benefit of thyroid hormone replacement therapy targeted to a middle-normal TSH concentration or active CVD screening for people with elevated TSH concentrations. Inadequate serum thyroid hormone produces impairment of cardiac function and may result in bradycardia, endothelial dysfunction, increased intima-media thickness, diastolic dysfunction, increased vascular resistance, and pericardial effusion. 3 Other epidemiological studies4-7 have also found an association between subclinical hypothyroidism or high-normal TSH concentrations and dyslipidemia, increased insulin resistance, and hypertension — components of metabolic syndrome.

There are several potential mechanisms that may explain the associations of subclinical hypothyroidism and high-normal TSH with death mediated through CVD. The thyroid hormone is one of the key regulators of cardiac function and cardiovascular hemodynamics; therefore, inadequate thyroid hormone levels impair the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle cells and decrease cardiac contractility by regulating calcium uptake and the expression of several contractile proteins in cardiomyocytes. 37, 38 Low thyroid hormone levels also increase systemic. vascular resistance and induce endothelial dysfunction by reducing nitric oxide availability. 37–39 Previous studies, 5–7, 40 including those using NHANES data, 5, 7 reported that low thyroid function even within the normal range is associated with metabolic syndrome owing to an increase in insulin resistance and might contribute to the progression of atherosclerosis and CVD risk.

41 While the exact underlying mechanisms are still unclear, these biological mechanisms support our finding that CVD partially mediates the association of higher TSH concentrations with death. In conclusion, using a nationally representative database of US adults, this study found that CVD mediated the associations of subclinical hypothyroidism and high-normal TSH concentrations with all-cause mortality, especially in women and possibly in older individuals. We did not find evidence of CVD mediation on the pathway from low-normal TSH concentrations to all-cause mortality. Further studies are needed to examine the clinical benefit of thyroid hormone replacement therapy targeted to a mid-normal TSH concentration or active CVD screening for people with elevated TSH concentrations.

### Thyroid hormones and modulation of diastolic function: a promising target for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^0f5255e3]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Overt hypothyroidism is defined as high TSH with low free T4. In most studies, it has been associated with increased risk of HF, coronary artery disease, and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Overt hypothyroidism is associated with decreased cardiac output and contractility, lower heart rate, and higher systemic vascular resistance. Diastolic dysfunction is a characteristic feature in most studies. Cardiovascular risk factors are amplified in patients with overt hypothyroidism, particularly diastolic hypertension and dyslipidemia. Most studies have also shown increased carotid artery intima-media thickness in overt hypothyroidism.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by low TSH with normal free T4. It has been associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, including coronary events, HF, and atrial fibrillation. Some studies showed an increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism, but others have shown no association.– The strongest association of subclinical hyperthyroidism appears to be with atrial fibrillation. However, some studies suggest that this association may only be seen when TSH < 0.1 mIU/l. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is also associated with a higher heart rate, higher frequency of premature atrial, and ventricular beats and ventricular hypertrophy, although the latter is not seen in all studies. Interestingly, as seen in subclinical hypothyroidism, subclinical hyperthyroidism is also associated with increased carotid artery intima-media thickness. Regarding cardiac function, the possible association of subclinical hyperthyroidism with systolic and diastolic dysfunction is yet to be clarified, as there is evidence both for and against it.

Overt hyperthyroidism is defined as low TSH with high free T4. It is associated with a hyperdynamic state, characterized by tachycardia, increased cardiac preload and contractility, and diminished systemic vascular resistance. In the short term, it may improve cardiovascular function, improving both systolic function and left ventricular relaxation. However, when sustained, it may induce high-output HF, even in the absence of underlying heart disease. Furthermore, overt hyperthyroidism is also strongly associated with atrial fibrillation. Overt hyperthyroidism has also been associated with pulmonary hypertension. Finally, untreated overt hyperthyroidism has consistently been associated with a higher risk of adverse cardiovascular events, as well as a higher risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.

### Cardiovascular hemodynamics and exercise tolerance in thyroid disease [^c968998d]. Thyroid (2002). Low credibility.

The heart is an organ sensitive to the action of thyroid hormone, and measurable changes in cardiovascular performance are detected with small variations in thyroid hormone serum concentrations. Most patients with thyroid disease experience cardiovascular manifestations, and the most serious complications of thyroid dysfunction occur as a result of cardiac involvement. The increased metabolic state and oxygen consumption that occur in hyperthyroid patients require an increased supply of oxygen and removal of metabolic products from the periphery. This is accomplished by increasing the cardiac output to meet the needs of the periphery. Circulation time is decreased in hyperthyroid patients, and a lowered arterial resistance and increased venous resistance promote the return of blood to the heart. Thyroid hormones may significantly decrease the strength of respiratory and skeletal muscles and affect regulatory mechanisms of adaptation to incremental effort. In hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular exercise testing and analysis of respiratory gas exchange demonstrate low efficiency of cardiopulmonary function as well as impaired chronotropic, contractile, and vasodilatatory reserves, which are reversible when euthyroidism is restored. During exercise, the increment (delta) of minute ventilation (respiratory rate x tidal volume), and oxygen pulse (oxygen uptake per heart beat) are significantly lower in dysthyroidism versus euthyroidism. Especially in older patients with thyroid dysfunction, markedly reduced workload, delta ejection fraction, and delta heart rate, both at the anaerobic threshold as well as at maximal exercise, are observed. In thyrotoxicosis, mitochondria oxidative dysfunction during exercise mostly causes intracellular acidosis, whereas in hypothyroidism, inadequate cardiovascular support appears to be one of the principal factors involved. These abnormalities partly explain why subjects with dysthyroidism are intolerant to exertion. Thus, in thyroid disease, both cardiac structures and function may remain normal at rest, however impaired cardiovascular and respiratory adaptation to effort becomes unmasked during exercise.

### Effects of thyroid hormone deficiency on electrocardiogram findings of congenitally hypothyroid neonates [^af86d437]. Thyroid (2001). Low credibility.

Hypothyroid status is believed to cause various metabolic changes in infants. However, it is interesting that even severely hypothyroid neonates, detected during mass neonatal screening, rarely show bradycardia, hypothermia, or inactivity. To study cardiac functions of screen-detected neonates with congenital hypothyroidism (CH), we recorded the electrocardiograms (ECG) of 53 screen-detected CH neonates before levothyroxine (LT4) replacement therapy, and 15 age-matched normal neonates for controls. The 53 CH neonates were divided into two groups according to initial serum thyroid hormone levels: a mildly hypothyroid group (n = 37), serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) less than 100 microIU/mL and free thyroxine (FT4) 0.6 ng/dl or more; and a severely hypothyroid group (n = 16), TSH 100 microIU/mL or more and FT4 less than 0.6 ng/dL. TSH, FT4, and other blood chemicals were measured on an autoanalyzer (Hitachi 7170). After blood sampling, the ECG was recorded during induced sleep by oral administration of triclofos sodium syrup. ECG parameters, including HR, PR, QRS, QT time and corrected QT time (QTc) were automatically obtained, using an auto-ECG analyzing system. The following results were obtained. No CH patients showed abnormal ECG findings. There was no significant difference of the mean heart rates (HRs) between the mildly hypothyroid (147.5 ± 16.3 beats per minute) and the control group (148.3 ± 12.1 beats per minute). The mean HR in the severely hypothyroid group (134.0 ± 17.9 beats per minute, p = 0.007) was significantly low compared with the normal control group. However, all values were within normal ranges. QTc in the severely hypothyroid group (0.414 ± 0.015, p = 0.033) was significantly shorter than in the control group (0.440 ± 0.052). No statistical differences of PR, QRS, and QT time were noted among the three groups. All ECG parameters were within normal ranges. HR positively correlated with FT4 and log (FT4), and negatively with TSH and log (TSH). From these results we conclude that the deficiency of thyroid hormones does not affect ECG findings of congenitally hypothyroid neonates. This may be consistent with the unexpectedly mild signs and symptoms of screen-detected hypothyroid neonates.

### Short-term overt hypothyroidism induces sympathovagal imbalance in thyroidectomized differentiated thyroid carcinoma patients [^26e7a3bb]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Thyroid hormone impacts on the cardiovascular system. (Subclinical) hyperthyroidism results in sympathovagal imbalance due to decreased vagal tone. However, conflicting data have been reported on the effects of hypothyroidism on the activity of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). In hypothyroidism, both increased and decreased sympathetic activity and increased vagal tone have been found.

Objective

To study the effects of acute short-term overt hypothyroidism and thyroxine replacement therapy on the ANS by measuring urinary excretion of catecholamines and heart rate variability (HRV).

Design

Prospective study.

Setting

University hospital.

Patients

We studied 11 patients, previously treated with thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma, during hypothyroidism caused by cessation of thyroxine substitution for 4 weeks and during thyroxine replacement therapy, and 21 matched healthy controls.

Main Outcome Measures

The activity of the ANS was assessed by measuring urinary excretion of catecholamines and HRV at rest and during a challenge of the ANS by a mental stress test.

Results

Urinary dopamine excretion was significantly lower during hypothyroidism. Although in the patients total variability was unchanged, HRV analysis showed a significantly lower low frequency/high frequency ratio, indicating sympathovagal imbalance with sympathetic withdrawal. The mental stress test in the patients resulted in a significant increase in heart rate to the extent of 16–18%. This response was not different between the hypothyroid state and during thyroxine replacement therapy suggesting that cardiovascular reflexes in these patients remain intact.

Conclusion

Acute short-term overt hypothyroidism results in sympathovagal imbalance with sympathetic withdrawal, with preservation of the cardiovascular reflexes to (mental) stress.

### Is there a causal relationship between hypothyroidism and hyponatremia? [^2825e591]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Studies were identified through a comprehensive PubMed-based search using the search terms 'hypothyroidism' and 'hyponatremia' in the article title or abstract. Studies and case reports in which hypothyroidism was suspected but ultimately determined not to be the cause of hyponatremia were excluded. Given the limited studies in this area, there was no prespecified time frame.
