## Question

Urinary tract infection treatment child

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treating urinary tract infections in children. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and specimen quality. Then, I should classify the UTI phenotype and severity. Next, I will select empiric therapy based on age, severity, and local resistance patterns, followed by duration decisions and when to individualize. After that, I need to plan for culture-directed de-escalation and reassessment at 48 hours. Finally, I will consider special populations, imaging indications, and prevention strategies, and I will close with a concise, practical algorithm and key takeaways anchored to high-quality evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and specimen quality, because I need to ensure we are treating true UTI rather than contamination or asymptomatic bacteriuria. In precontinent children, bagged specimens have unacceptably high false-positive rates, so I should obtain a catheterized specimen or perform suprapubic aspiration if antimicrobial therapy is going to be started, and I should pair urinalysis with quantitative culture using the 50,000 CFU/mL threshold for a single uropathogen plus pyuria to establish UTI, while remembering that asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated in children [^1121mZzi] [^116Gz7Mn] [^116dkUPu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment before I classify the UTI phenotype and severity, since this drives route, agent, and duration. I should distinguish febrile UTI suggestive of pyelonephritis from afebrile cystitis, assess for systemic toxicity or sepsis, and identify complicating features such as age under 2 months, known urologic anomalies, immunocompromise, or recurrent infections, because these factors shift management toward initial IV therapy, broader coverage, and longer durations [^116x7fcQ] [^112z2pwe] [^117DocBi].

> Next, I should review empiric antibiotic selection, and I need to ensure I anchor choices to local antibiograms and resistance risks. For uncomplicated febrile UTI in children 2 to 24 months, oral therapy is as effective as parenteral therapy, so I can start with an oral agent such as amoxicillin-clavulanate, a cephalosporin like cefdinir, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole if local resistance is under 20 percent, while avoiding ampicillin or amoxicillin monotherapy where resistance exceeds 20 percent, and I should reserve parenteral ceftriaxone for those who cannot tolerate oral therapy or are severely ill [^114vUek1] [^111jvLWg] [^113UcpBW].

> Wait, let me verify duration recommendations because this is an area of evolving evidence. Traditional guidance supports 7 to 14 days for febrile UTI, but newer comparative effectiveness data suggest that 7 days may suffice for many children with pyelonephritis, and an individualised strategy stopping 3 days after clinical improvement with a minimum of 4 days reduced antibiotic exposure in a recent RCT, albeit with a small increase in early recurrence that did not meet noninferiority, so I should individualize duration when the child is clearly improving and ensure close follow-up [^116doJUG] [^115mn8Lz] [^112amWAz].

> I will now examine lower tract cystitis, where shorter courses are reasonable. Evidence supports 2 to 4 days as effective as 7 to 14 days for uncomplicated cystitis, though a large RCT showed higher treatment failure with 5 total days versus 10 total days when therapy was stopped at day 5, so I should confirm clinical improvement before shortening and avoid single-dose therapy, which is inferior for eradication [^116fi8dJ] [^112N8jzD] [^114PuAxo] [^114oxSmY].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with neonates and infants under 2 months. I should treat these as complicated UTI with initial parenteral therapy, obtain blood cultures, and extend total therapy to 10 to 14 days, with IV durations individualized to bacteremia and clinical stability, and I should remember that short IV courses, even 3 days or fewer, can be safe when followed by appropriate oral therapy in stable infants [^117DocBi] [^115RRx6Q].

> For children with recurrent UTI or known urologic abnormalities, I should confirm that empiric choices account for prior cultures and resistance risks, consider broader agents if ESBL risk is high, and avoid using the same prophylactic agent for treatment to mitigate breakthrough, while planning imaging and potential urologic referral when indicated [^116x7fcQ] [^1155TKup] [^1141U6vd].

> Next, I should review culture-directed de-escalation and the 48-hour reassessment. I need to check culture and susceptibilities at 48 hours, narrow to the narrowest effective agent, and reassess clinically. If there is no improvement, I should repeat urinalysis and culture, obtain renal ultrasound to evaluate for obstruction or abscess, and consider blood cultures or additional imaging rather than reflexively escalating antibiotics [^116SCarT] [^117W3So1].

> I should double-check imaging indications because routine cystography is no longer recommended after a first febrile UTI. Renal and bladder ultrasound is appropriate after a first febrile UTI in young children or with recurrent infections, and voiding cystourethrography is reserved for abnormal ultrasound, atypical course, or recurrent febrile UTI, with renal cortical scintigraphy considered when scarring would change management [^114u2fnH] [^116UVaz1] [^117W3So1].

> But wait, what about prevention and prophylaxis. I need to ensure I do not overuse prophylaxis, as benefits are modest and resistance risk rises. Long-term antibiotics may reduce recurrence slightly, but the absolute benefit is small and must be balanced against resistance and adherence, so prophylaxis should be reserved for select high-risk children such as those with high-grade VUR or frequent recurrences, with periodic reassessment of need [^114KFTvZ] [^111dXmYj].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm to keep this actionable. Confirm UTI with catheterized or SPA specimen plus urinalysis and culture, classify as febrile versus afebrile and assess for complicating features, choose oral therapy for stable children and IV ceftriaxone for severe illness or inability to tolerate oral therapy, treat for 7 to 10 days for febrile UTI with consideration of 7 days if improving rapidly and 2 to 4 days for uncomplicated cystitis, reassess at 48 hours to de-escalate and evaluate for complications if not improving, and arrange ultrasound after first febrile UTI or with recurrences, reserving VCUG for abnormal studies or recurrences [^1121mZzi] [^116doJUG] [^116SCarT] [^114u2fnH].

> Finally, I need to ensure key takeaways are explicit and evidence-based. Oral therapy is as effective as parenteral therapy for most children, duration can often be shorter than historically taught especially for cystitis and selected pyelonephritis cases, individualization reduces antibiotic exposure but requires vigilant follow-up, and antimicrobial stewardship with attention to local resistance patterns is essential to preserve effective options for pediatric UTIs [^114vUek1] [^114PuAxo] [^112amWAz] [^113UcpBW].

---

Treat pediatric UTI with **7–10 days** of antibiotics for febrile or upper-tract disease [^116doJUG] and **3–5 days** for lower-tract cystitis [^112SQDPL], adjusting to local resistance and culture results [^114vUek1]. Oral therapy is **effective** for most children [^114vUek1]; use IV therapy for severe illness, vomiting, or inability to tolerate oral meds [^113vNLta]. Obtain a **urine culture** before starting antibiotics when feasible [^1121mZzi], and arrange renal ultrasound after a first febrile UTI or if recurrent/complicated [^116doJUG] [^116UVaz1]. Avoid routine prophylaxis unless high-risk (e.g. high-grade VUR) [^114KFTvZ], and monitor for clinical response within 48–72 hours [^116SCarT].

---

## Diagnostic confirmation

- **Urine collection**: Obtain a clean-catch midstream specimen in toilet-trained children; use catheterization or suprapubic aspiration in infants and young children [^1121mZzi].

- **Urine analysis**: Look for pyuria and bacteriuria; leukocyte esterase and nitrite on dipstick support UTI but are not definitive [^1131GCyJ].

- **Urine culture**: Gold standard; ≥ 50,000 CFU/mL of a single uropathogen with pyuria confirms UTI [^116Gz7Mn].

---

## Empiric antibiotic therapy

Empiric therapy should be guided by **local resistance patterns** and **patient-specific factors** [^114vUek1]:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended empiric therapy** |
|-|-|
| Uncomplicated lower UTI (cystitis) | - Amoxicillin-clavulanate <br/> - Cephalosporins (cefixime, cefpodoxime) <br/> - Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (if local resistance < 20%) [^113UcpBW] |
| Febrile UTI/pyelonephritis | - Oral: amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefixime, or cefpodoxime <br/> - IV: ceftriaxone or cefotaxime [^notfound] |
| Severe illness/sepsis | IV ceftriaxone or cefotaxime; add aminoglycoside if concern for resistant organisms [^notfound] |

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

- **Febrile UTI/pyelonephritis**: 7–10 days [^115Mjooa]; shorter courses (5–7 days) may be effective in select cases [^115mn8Lz] [^112amWAz].

- **Lower UTI (cystitis)**: 3–5 days [^112SQDPL]; shorter courses are effective and reduce adverse effects [^112N8jzD].

- **Infants < 2 months**: 10–14 days, typically IV initially due to risk of bacteremia [^117DocBi].

---

## Route of administration

Oral therapy is **effective** for most children, including those with febrile UTI, if they can tolerate it [^114vUek1] [^112WBDMH]. IV therapy is indicated for severe illness, vomiting, inability to tolerate oral medications, or when absorption is questionable [^113vNLta].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

- **Clinical response**: Assess within 48–72 hours; if no improvement, reassess diagnosis, adherence, and consider imaging or alternative diagnoses [^116SCarT].

- **Imaging**: Renal and bladder ultrasound after first febrile UTI or if recurrent/complicated [^116doJUG] [^116UVaz1].

- **Prophylaxis**: Not routine; consider only in high-risk children (e.g. high-grade VUR) [^114KFTvZ] [^113wtdNf].

---

## Special considerations

- **Antibiotic resistance**: Rising resistance necessitates local surveillance and judicious antibiotic use [^113UcpBW] [^114akPFB].

- **Bladder and bowel dysfunction**: Evaluate and treat in recurrent UTIs to reduce recurrence risk [^115ads4f] [^115HaoZs].

- **Parent education**: Emphasize adherence, hydration, and prompt evaluation of recurrent symptoms [^117EQ1hM].

---

Pediatric UTI management centers on **accurate diagnosis**, **empiric therapy aligned with local resistance**, and **duration tailored to disease severity**, with close follow-up and selective imaging to guide care.

### Urinary tract infections in children [^1132FL8r]. Pediatrics in Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for the evaluation, treatment, and management of urinary tract infections (UTIs), UTI diagnosis and management remains challenging for clinicians. Challenges with acute UTI management stem from vague presenting signs and symptoms, diagnostic uncertainty, limitations in laboratory testing, and selecting appropriate antibiotic therapy in an era with increasing rates of antibiotic-resistant uropathogens. Recurrent UTI management remains difficult due to an incomplete understanding of the factors contributing to UTI, when to assess a child with repeated infections for kidney and urinary tract anomalies, and limited prevention strategies. To help reduce these uncertainties, this review provides a comprehensive overview of UTI epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies that may help pediatricians overcome the challenges associated with acute and recurrent UTI management.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® urinary tract infection-child: 2023 update [^117W3So1]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequent infection in childhood. The diagnosis is usually made by history and physical examination and confirmed by urine analysis. Cystitis is infection or inflammation confined to the bladder, whereas pyelonephritis is infection or inflammation of kidneys. Pyelonephritis can cause renal scarring, which is the most severe long-term sequela of UTI and can lead to accelerated nephrosclerosis, leading to hypertension and chronic renal failure. The role of imaging is to guide treatment by identifying patients who are at high risk to develop recurrent UTIs or renal scarring. This document provides initial imaging guidelines for children presenting with first febrile UTI with appropriate response to medical management, atypical or recurrent febrile UTI, and follow-up imaging for children with established vesicoureteral reflux. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^1116o5L4]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) present a challenge to the clinician because of the variety of clinical syndromes included and consequent difficulties in synthesizing evidence for practical guidance. The cumulative incidence of all childhood UTI by the age of 7 years is 1%–2% in boys and 7% in girls. Of those presenting to emergency, 5%–24% are deemed cUTI, so it is a common childhood infection. However, defining what makes a UTI complicated is difficult because it has been characterized by a variety of UTI syndromes, which include hosts with abnormal urology or other underlying conditions, severe clinical presentations with or without extensive tissue involvement, and unusual pathogens. For this review and guideline, cUTIs are those that require other management considerations than straightforward lower or upper tract UTIs for which evidence and guidelines exist. Accurate diagnosis and management of cUTI limit morbidity and mortality from sepsis and long-term renal damage. However, most trials of UTI in children have excluded those with cUTI, and consequently, many guidelines also exclude them. The absence of a standardized definition for cUTI has resulted in inconsistencies in treatment approaches, which may lead to increased morbidity among affected children. Existing major UTI guidelines for children either do not address complicated UTIs at all or are limited to only some complications or some age groups. –

This review aims to address the four most important controversies when managing children with cUTI and provide recommendations for definition, investigations, treatment and follow-up. The resulting guidelines offer evidence-graded recommendations specifically for the management of pediatric cUTI, addressing gaps that exist in current guidelines.

### Urinary tract infection in children: diagnosis, treatment, imaging-comparison of current guidelines [^114435LA]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequent disorder of childhood, yet the proper approach for a child with UTI is still a matter of controversy. The objective of this study was to critically compare current guidelines for the diagnosis and management of UTI in children, in light of new scientific data.

Methods

An analysis was performed of the guidelines from: American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), Italian Society of Pediatric Nephrology, Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS), Polish Society of Pediatric Nephrology, and European Association of Urology (EAU)/European Society for Pediatric Urology (ESPU). Separate aspects of the approach for a child with UTI, including diagnosis, treatment and further imaging studies, were compared, with allowance for recent research in each field.

Conclusions

The analyzed guidelines tried to reconcile recent reports about diagnosis, treatment, and further diagnostics in pediatric UTI with prior practices and opinions, and economic capabilities. There was still a lack of sufficient data to formulate coherent, unequivocal guidelines on UTI management in children, with imaging tests remaining the main area of controversy. As a result, the authors formulated their own proposal for UTI management in children.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequent diagnosis in children who are referred to the urologist. Although most infections will resolve without complication after appropriate treatment, a wide array of potential complicating factors exists, which can make difficult the rapid resolution of a UTI. Clinical scenarios involving these factors require a high index of suspicion and prompt initiation of appropriate therapy.

### Urinary tract infections in children: an overview of diagnosis and management [^117EeSio]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common and potentially serious bacterial infection of childhood. History and examination findings can be non-specific, so a urine sample is required to diagnose UTI. Sample collection in young precontinent children can be challenging. Bedside dipstick tests are useful for screening, but urine culture is required for diagnostic confirmation. Antibiotic therapy must be guided by local guidelines due to increasing antibiotic resistance. Duration of therapy and indications for imaging remain controversial topics and guidelines lack consensus. This article presents an overview of paediatric UTI diagnosis and management, with highlights of recent advances and evidence updates.

### Antibiotics for treating lower urinary tract infection in children [^114oxSmY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial infections in infants and children. Lower UTI is the most commonly presenting and in the majority of cases can be easily treated with a course of antibiotic therapy with no further complications. A number of antimicrobials have been used to treat children with lower UTIs; however is it unclear what are the specific benefits and harms of such treatments.

Objectives

This review aims to summarise the benefits and harms of antibiotics for treating lower UTI in children.

Search Methods

We searched the Renal Group's Specialised Register (April 2012), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 5), MEDLINE OVID SP (from 1966), and EMBASE OVID SP (from 1988) without language restriction. Date of last search: May 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in which antibiotic therapy was used to treat bacteriologically proven, symptomatic, lower UTI in children aged zero to 18 years in primary and community healthcare settings were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Sixteen RCTs, analysing 1,116 children were included. Conventional 10-day antibiotic treatment significantly increased the number of children free of persistent bacteriuria compared to single-dose therapy (6 studies, 228 children: RR 2.01, 95%CI 1.06 to 3.80). No heterogeneity was observed. Persistent bacteriuria at the end of treatment was reported in 24% of children receiving single-dose therapy compared to 10% of children who were randomised to 10-day therapy. There were no significant differences between groups for persistent symptoms, recurrence following treatment, or re-infection following treatment. There was insufficient data to analyse the effect of antibiotics on renal parenchymal damage, compliance, development of resistant organisms or adverse events. Despite the inclusion of 16 RCTs, methodological weakness and small sample sizes made it difficult to conclude if any of the included antibiotics or regimens were superior to another.

Authors' Conclusions

Although antibiotic treatment is effective for children with UTI, there are insufficient data to answer the question of which type of antibiotic or which duration is most effective to treat symptomatic lower UTI. This review found that 10-day antibiotic treatment is more likely to eliminate bacteria from the urine than single-dose treatments. No differences were observed for persistent bacteriuria, recurrence or re-infection between short and long-course antibiotics where the antibiotic differed between groups. This data adds to an existing Cochrane review comparing short and long-course treatment of the same antibiotic who also reported no evidence of difference between short and long-course antibiotics.

Future research should include standardized definitions of children with cUTI. Treatment duration and benefits of prophylaxis should be assessed separately for each subgroup, with outcomes not only considering treatment failure but also other factors including antibiotic resistance, side effects and home management in a more holistic way. Furthermore, studies should focus on evaluating the long-term outcomes of children treated according to these guidelines to further validate and refine these recommendations.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnostic policy considerations: Harms/risks/costs state that stringent diagnostic criteria may miss a small number of UTIs, the benefit-harms assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm, and value judgments note that treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria may be harmful; the role of patient preferences is that parents prefer no action in the absence of a UTI (avoiding false-positive results) over a very small chance of missing a UTI, with exclusions noted as none, intentional vagueness as none, and policy level as recommendation.

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of urinary tract infections in pediatrics and adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^1122dnZP]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Traditional approaches to practice guidelines frequently result in dissociation between strength of recommendation and quality of evidence.

Objective

To create a clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections that addresses the gap between the evidence and recommendation strength.

Evidence Review

This consensus statement and systematic review applied an approach previously established by the WikiGuidelines Group to construct collaborative clinical guidelines. In May 2023, new and existing members were solicited for questions on urinary tract infection prevention, diagnosis, and management. For each topic, literature searches were conducted up until early 2024 in any language. Evidence was reported according to the WikiGuidelines charter: clear recommendations were established only when reproducible, prospective, controlled studies provided hypothesis-confirming evidence. In the absence of such data, clinical reviews were developed discussing the available literature and associated risks and benefits of various approaches.

Findings

A total of 54 members representing 12 countries reviewed 914 articles and submitted information relevant to 5 sections: prophylaxis and prevention (7 questions), diagnosis and diagnostic stewardship (7 questions), empirical treatment (3 questions), definitive treatment and antimicrobial stewardship (10 questions), and special populations and genitourinary syndromes (10 questions). Of 37 unique questions, a clear recommendation could be provided for 6 questions. In 3 of the remaining questions, a clear recommendation could only be provided for certain aspects of the question. Clinical reviews were generated for the remaining questions and aspects of questions not meeting criteria for a clear recommendation.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this consensus statement that applied the WikiGuidelines method for clinical guideline development, the majority of topics relating to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of urinary tract infections lack high-quality prospective data and clear recommendations could not be made. Randomized clinical trials are underway to address some of these gaps; however further research is of utmost importance to inform true evidence-based, rather than eminence-based practice.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^112KQckX]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial therapy duration for febrile UTI — the total course of therapy should be 7 to 14 days, and there is evidence that 1- to 3-day courses for febrile UTIs are inferior to courses in the recommended range; therefore, the minimal duration selected should be 7 days. Outcomes of short courses (1–3 d) are inferior to those of 7- to 14-d courses, and there are minimal harm and minor cost effects of antimicrobial choice and duration of therapy. Aggregate quality of evidence: A/B (RCTs), intentional vagueness notes that no evidence distinguishes the benefit of treating 7 vs 10 vs 14 days, and the policy level is Strong recommendation/ recommendation.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^116x7fcQ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Over the last 5 years, new and updated pediatric UTI guidelines from around the world have become increasingly consistent for uncomplicated UTI, but either do not address or differ in definition and recommendations for complicated UTI. This is the first comprehensive guideline focused exclusively on cUTI in children that addresses its diagnosis and management according to the features making it complicated: young age, disease severity/extent and comorbidities. This guideline is comprehensive in addressing gaps in existing guidelines by first highlighting that cUTI is not a uniform entity but rather constitutes a wide range of disease processes. The guideline presents the evidence for diagnosing and managing the subgroups presenting with each of these processes to ensure more individualized patient management. It also reviews emerging evidence for conceptualizing cUTI as an amalgamation of patients' individual features and attainment of a threshold for more intense management. Regardless of the subgroup, accurate diagnosis is the critical first step in managing children with cUTI for which additional investigations, such as blood culture, serum biochemistry and USS, might be required. While several subgroups benefit from initial IV (sepsis, VUR 3–5, neonates) and broad-spectrum antibiotics (sepsis, high risk of resistance from recurrent UTI and immunocompromise), oral narrow-spectrum antibiotics are recommended for most children with cUTI who are not severely unwell. Prophylaxis is not needed universally in cUTI, and its relatively small benefits in specific subgroups need to be weighed against the risk of resistance, with at least 6-monthly reevaluation for its requirement. Longer-term follow-up should aim to assess the need for surgical intervention to reduce the risk of renal damage.

Despite cUTI being common in children, differences in definition and focus on uncomplicated infection have led to scarce high-grade evidence for management, that is also difficult to synthesize. Apart from RCT-based recommendations for CAP in children with urological abnormality, these guidelines are largely based on retrospective studies and expert consensus in areas where high-quality evidence is currently lacking. In addition, available evidence mostly comes from resource-rich settings, and in resource-limited settings there may be some barriers to accessing some investigations and treatments, for example, nuclear medicine imaging and broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, most first-line investigations in the guideline are broadly available and most antibiotic recommendations are from the World Health Organization Access list which should be available in most countries. Therefore, these guidelines can be effectively implemented in most healthcare settings, even in resource-limited environments.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^1178Ldht]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics urinary tract infection guideline — scope and treatment duration clarifies that the guideline addresses initial management of the first UTI in febrile infants 2 to 24 months of age. The text adds that some infants will have recurrent UTIs or be identified with VUR or other abnormalities and that further research on optimal management in specific situations would be valuable. It also states that the optimal duration of antimicrobial treatment has not been determined and calls for RCTs of head-to-head comparisons of various duration to limit antimicrobial exposure to what is needed to eradicate the offending uropathogen.

### Imaging in urinary tract infections: current strategies and new trends [^112Gh2k2]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The aim of imaging in a child with urinary tract infection (UTI) is to detect abnormalities that require appropriate treatment or findings that can be acted on to prevent development of complications (hypertension, chronic renal failure or pregnancy-related complications). Imaging protocols in pediatric urinary tract infections are evolving. From strategies based on extensive investigations in all children younger than 7 years of age, we are slowly moving to imaging strategies focused on children at risk of developing renal damage and possibly long-term complications. The article provides an overview on urinary tract infections, their complications and the use of imaging in their management. The different imaging strategies in children with UTIs (including the recommendation of excluding from imaging certain groups of patients) still needs full evaluation. It is interesting to note, however, a slow move from wide use of cystography in all children with UTI, which has been standard practice for many years but was probably not based on solid scientific evidence, toward a more focused use of cystograms in specific groups of children.

### Medical treatment for urinary tract infections [^113wS4eQ]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common source of morbidity and require significant health care resources for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Antimicrobials represent the mainstay for the treatment of UTIs. Established guidelines exist for the antimicrobial treatment and prevention of uncomplicated UTIs; however, antimicrobial dependence and overuse have led to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Nonantimicrobial alternatives are an ongoing area of research and should be considered when clinically appropriate based on available evidence.

### A meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials comparing short-and long-course antibiotic therapy for urinary tract infections in children [^111118Ux]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Short-course antibiotic regimens, ranging in duration from a single dose to 3 days, are the current standard of care for the treatment of acute lower urinary tract infections (UTIs) in adult women. Despite multiple small randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) showing no difference in efficacy between short-course (≤ 3 days) and long-course (7–14 days) therapy in children, concerns about occult pyelonephritis and renal scarring have prompted standard recommendations of 7 to 14 days of antibiotics for UTIs in children.

Objective

To determine whether long-course antibiotic therapy is more effective than short-course therapy for the treatment of UTIs in children, and to explore potential sources of heterogeneity in the results of existing studies.

Methods

We searched online bibliographic databases (Medline and Cochrane Clinical Trials Registry) for RCTs comparing short- and long-course therapy for the treatment of UTI in children, and examined the references of all retrieved articles. Candidate studies for meta-analysis were restricted to RCTs comparing short-course (≤ 3 days) and long-course (7–14 days) outpatient therapy for acute UTI in children age 0 to 18 years. We excluded studies that were restricted to children with recurrent UTI or included children with asymptomatic bacteriuria. Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Study quality was evaluated using a 9-item scoring system developed by the investigators. Data on the primary outcomes-treatment failure and reinfection rate-were extracted when available and reanalyzed based on intention to treat whenever possible. To determine whether anatomic level of infection (upper vs lower urinary tract) influenced the results, the meta-analysis was repeated on the subgroup of studies that attempted to restrict their participants to children with lower UTI. To determine whether there was a dose-response effect for the duration of short-course therapy, we performed separate subgroup analyses of studies of single-dose or single-day therapy and studies of 3-day therapy. To explore other potential sources of study result heterogeneity, such as study quality and patient age, we developed a random-effects regression model that included these variables as covariates.

Results

The pooled estimate for the relative risk (RR) of treatment failure with short-course antibiotic therapy was 1.94 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.19–3.15) and for the RR of reinfection was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.39–1.47). When we excluded the 3 studies that did not attempt to restrict their participants to patients with lower UTI, the pooled RR of treatment failure was 1.74 (95% CI: 1.05–2.88) and of reinfection was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.32–1.52). For the subgroup of studies comparing single-dose or 1-day therapy to long-course therapy, the pooled RR of treatment failure was 2.73 (95% CI: 1.38–5.40) and of reinfection was 0.37 (95% CI: 0.12–1.18). For the subgroup of studies comparing 3-day therapy to long-course therapy, the pooled RR of treatment failure was 1.36 (95% CI: 0.68–2.72) and of reinfection was 0.99 (95% CI: 0.46–2.13). In the meta-regression, neither study quality nor mean participant age was significantly associated with the odds ratio of treatment failure or reinfection, in either the complete set of studies or the subset of studies restricted to patients with lower UTI.

Conclusions

In pooled analyses of published studies comparing long- and short-course antibiotic treatment of UTI in children, long-course therapy was associated with fewer treatment failures without a concomitant increase in reinfections, even when studies including patients with evidence of pyelonephritis were excluded from the analysis. Until there are more accurate methods for distinguishing upper from lower UTI in children, no additional comparative trials are warranted and clinicians should continue to treat children with UTI for 7 to 14 days.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^117TwgWA]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background:

Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) present a challenge to the clinician because of the variety in clinical syndromes included and consequent difficulties in synthesizing evidence. A harmonized definition of cUTI does not exist. In national guidelines, management recommendations for cUTI are often neglected. We aimed to define the four most important controversies and formulate management recommendations for cUTI in children and adolescents.

Methods:

The European Society of Pediatric Infectious Diseases Guideline Committee convened a working group of experts from microbiology, pediatric nephrology and infectious diseases with expertise in managing children with UTI. A comprehensive literature review was done using PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane library to find studies in children under 18 years published until December 2024. Four controversies were defined from experience and available evidence. Children with cUTI were categorized into 5 subgroups: anatomical/functional urological abnormalities, multiple UTI recurrences, severe clinical presentation, nonurological underlying conditions and neonates. Respective management guidelines were formulated through the evidence and by consensus of working group members. Recommendations were made using GRADE criteria.

Results:

The term cUTI is generally used to define children with UTI with an increased likelihood of failing conventional management. The included 5 subgroups are the most likely to need additional investigations at diagnosis and during the course of infection, initial intravenous antibiotics, longer treatment duration, antibiotic prophylaxis, follow-up imaging and surgical referral. These are detailed for each subgroup.

Conclusions:

These comprehensive guidelines offer evidence-graded recommendations specifically for pediatric cUTI, addressing gaps that exist in current guidelines.

METHODS

The European Society of Pediatric Infectious Diseases Guidelines Committee convened a working group of experts from microbiology, pediatric nephrology and infectious diseases. The working group conducted a comprehensive literature review using PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane library of studies published until December 2024. Search terms included: urinary tract infection/UTI, complicated, complex, atypical, urinary tract abnormality/anomaly, recurrent/recurrence, chronic renal/kidney disease/failure, immunosuppression, adolescent, child, pediatric, infant, neonate/neonatal, definition, investigations, diagnosis, treatment, management, antibiotics, prophylaxis and imaging. Studies were included for review if they involved children under 18 years with any definition of cUTI and excluded if they focused solely on uncomplicated UTI (uUTI) or adults. Types of included studies were reviews, trials, comparative and cohort studies and existing guidelines were also reviewed for references. Four key controversies were identified from experience and available literature: definition of cUTI, investigations, treatment and follow-up. Evaluation of evidence quality and formulation of recommendations used GRADE methodology. After assessment of the literature on definition, cUTIs were categorized into 5 main subgroups, and respective management guidelines were formulated from the graded evidence by working group consensus.

Antimicrobials reach high urinary concentrations, yet barriers include adherence to a daily regimen, adverse effects, and emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Evidence of effectiveness with a well-tolerated, safe product and parent education are needed; a urinary antiseptic that could be taken indefinitely without resistance is particularly desirable, and probiotics are another possible strategy.

### Pediatric urinary tract infections [^112q8FLX]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in children are commonly seen in the emergency department and pose several challenges to establishing the proper diagnosis and determining management. This article reviews pediatric UTI and addresses epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and imaging, and their importance to the practicing emergency medicine provider. Accurate and timely diagnosis of pediatric UTI can prevent short-term complications, such as severe pyelonephritis or sepsis, and long-term sequelae including scarring of the kidneys, hypertension, and ultimately chronic renal insufficiency and need for transplant.

### Comparative effectiveness of antibiotic treatment duration in children with pyelonephritis [^115mn8Lz]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the comparative effectiveness of a short-course of antibiotic treatment for pyelonephritis in children vs a prolonged-course of antibiotics?

Findings

In this comparative effectiveness research study of 791 children (aged 6 months to 18 years) with pyelonephritis, no difference was found in the odds of treatment failure for children prescribed a short-course of antibiotics (median 8 days) vs a prolonged-course of antibiotics (median 11 days).

Meaning

Results of this study suggest that short-courses of antibiotic therapy may be as effective as prolonged-courses for the treatment of pyelonephritis in children.

Additional blood tests, and imaging can be useful depending on the subgroup of cUTI, both for initial diagnosis and subsequently (Table 2), with the rationale for their use often different at different stages in the infection. For example, USS of the kidneys and urinary tract during the acute phase can neither rule in nor rule out an upper UTI (pyelonephritis) or vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). Therefore, the role of acute USS in children with urosepsis, septic shock, poor urine flow, abdominal or bladder mass and increased creatinine is to determine whether there is acute obstruction that needs urgent surgical intervention.USS may be performed for different reasons, including failure to respond with suitable antibiotics within 48 hours to investigate for renal abscess, or for recurrent UTI to assess for other urological abnormalities needing intervention.

All children should be reassessed 48 hours after diagnosis for (1) clinical response to treatment, (2) confirmation of the diagnosis and (3) potential targeting of antibiotics according to susceptibility (aim to the narrow antimicrobial spectrum).

Treatment should be stopped if the UTI diagnosis is not confirmed, that is, most cases with a negative urine culture with no prior antibiotics to explain this. If the response to treatment is atypical and does not follow the expected trajectory after 48 hours, reassessment for the cause is imperative, rather than simply switching to IV or broader-spectrum antibiotics (although either of these could be needed). Depending on the clinical situation, repeat urine culture, inflammatory markers, serum creatinine and renal USS may be needed to confirm the UTI diagnosis and assess for complications. Other investigations may be needed to seek an alternate/additional diagnosis.

How Should Children With cUTI be Treated?

Treatment of cUTI involves consideration of antibiotic route, choice and duration and supportive management. The majority of RCTs and meta-analyses of childhood UTIs exclude those with cUTIs, so recommendations largely rely on a synthesis of retrospective studies (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 2,) and expert opinion to provide a practical empirical guideline to initiate treatment (Table 3). Due to the variability of complicating features even within subgroups, a further individualized approach is often needed, considering local antibiograms, past urine cultures, antibiotic exposure, hospital admissions, urine catheterization and other host factors, including allergies.

### Urinary tract infections in children: an overview of diagnosis and management [^111iDPLy]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Summary

UTI is a common bacterial infection of childhood. Clinical diagnosis is unreliable, and a urine sample is required for diagnosis, but collection is not straightforward in precontinent children. Dipstick leucocyte and nitrite screening can inform initial management while awaiting culture confirmation. Prompt management aims to prevent short-term morbidity such as urosepsis and long-term morbidity such as renal scarring. Recent evidence supports less aggressive imaging following uncomplicated UTI. Antibiotic resistance is an increasing challenge. International guidelines have conflicting recommendations regarding sample collection methods, antibiotic duration and imaging indications. Targeted research is required to inform knowledge gaps and inform cost-effective care for paediatric UTI.

This paper describes urinary tract infections (UTI) from the perspective of a disturbed balance between bacterial virulence and host defence. In some children, a UTI is caused by a virulent Escherichia coli, while in other cases children with abnormal renal tracts can get infected by almost any bacteria. Such knowledge can help in guiding treatment, investigations and follow-up of a child with a UTI.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^116Gz7Mn]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Conclusions — In infants and young children 2 to 24 months of age with UTI and unexplained fever, diagnosis is based on the presence of pyuria and at least 50 000 CFUs per mL of a single uropathogen in an appropriately collected specimen of urine; urinalysis alone does not provide a definitive diagnosis. Strategies for diagnosis and treatment depend on whether the clinician determines that antimicrobial therapy is warranted immediately or can be delayed safely until urine culture and urinalysis results are available. After 7 to 14 days of antimicrobial treatment, close clinical follow-up monitoring should be maintained with evaluation of the urine during subsequent febrile episodes to permit prompt diagnosis and treatment of recurrent infections.

### Revised AAP guideline on UTI in febrile infants and young children [^111Z7V9H]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

In 2011, the American Academy of Pediatrics released a revision of its 1999 clinical practice guideline on urinary tract infections in febrile infants and young children two to 24 months of age. The new clinical practice guideline has several important updates based on evidence generated over the past decade. The updated guideline includes clinical criteria for collecting urine specimens. Diagnosis now requires evidence of infection from both abnormal urinalysis results and positive urine culture results (the criterion for a positive culture has been reduced from at least 100,000 colony-forming units per mL to at least 50,000 colony-forming units per mL). Oral treatment now is considered to be as effective as parenteral treatment. Renal and bladder ultrasonography is still recommended, but the biggest change in the current guideline is that routine voiding cystourethrography is no longer recommended after the first urinary tract infection. Follow-up is based on evaluating children for urinary tract infection during subsequent febrile episodes, rather than routinely performing repeat urine cultures.

### Antibiotics for acute pyelonephritis in children [^112WBDMH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial infections in infants. The most severe form of UTI is acute pyelonephritis, which results in significant acute morbidity and may cause permanent kidney damage. There remains uncertainty regarding the optimum antibiotic regimen, route of administration and duration of treatment. This is an update of a review that was first published in 2003 and updated in 2005 and 2007.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of antibiotics used to treat children with acute pyelonephritis. The aspects of therapy considered were 1) different antibiotics, 2) different dosing regimens of the same antibiotic, 3) different duration of treatment, and 4) different routes of administration.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, reference lists of articles and conference proceedings without language restriction to 10 April 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing different antibiotic agents, routes, frequencies or durations of therapy in children aged 0 to 18 years with proven UTI and acute pyelonephritis were selected.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random-effects model and the results expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean difference (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

This updated review included 27 studies (4452 children). This update included evidence from three new studies, and following re-evaluation, a previously excluded study was included because it now met our inclusion criteria. Risk of bias was assessed as low for sequence generation (12 studies), allocation concealment (six studies), blinding of outcome assessors (17 studies), incomplete outcome reporting (19 studies) and selective outcome reporting (13 studies). No study was blinded for participants or investigators. The 27 included studies evaluated 12 different comparisons. No significant differences were found in duration of fever (2 studies, 808 children: MD 2.05 hours, 95% CI -0.84 to 4.94), persistent UTI at 72 hours after commencing therapy (2 studies, 542 children: RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.07 to 17.41) or persistent kidney damage at six to 12 months (4 studies, 943 children: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.12) between oral antibiotic therapy (10 to 14 days) and intravenous (IV) therapy (3 days) followed by oral therapy (10 days). Similarly, no significant differences in persistent bacteriuria at the end of treatment (4 studies, 305 children: RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.55) or persistent kidney damage (4 studies, 726 children: RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.29) were found between IV therapy (three to four days) followed by oral therapy and IV therapy (seven to 14 days). No significant differences in efficacy were found between daily and thrice daily administration of aminoglycosides (1 study, 179 children, persistent clinical symptoms at three days: RR 1.98, 95% CI 0.37 to 10.53). Adverse events were mild and uncommon and rarely resulted in discontinuation of treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated review increases the body of evidence that oral antibiotics alone are as effective as a short course (three to four days) of IV antibiotics followed by oral therapy for a total treatment duration of 10 to 14 days for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis in children. When IV antibiotics are given, a short course (two to four days) of IV therapy followed by oral therapy is as effective as a longer course (seven to 10 days) of IV therapy. If IV therapy with aminoglycosides is chosen, single daily dosing is safe and effective. Insufficient data are available to extrapolate these findings to children aged less than one month of age or to children with dilating vesicoureteric reflux (grades III-V). Further studies are required to determine the optimal total duration of antibiotic therapy required for acute pyelonephritis.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaUrinary tract Infection-child [^116UVaz1]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in young children and may cause pyelonephritis and renal scarring. Long-term complications from renal scarring are low. The role of imaging is to evaluate for underlying urologic abnormalities and guide treatment. In neonates there is increased risk for underlying urologic abnormalities. Evaluation for vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) may be appropriate especially in boys because of higher prevalence of VUR and to exclude posterior urethral valve. In children older than 2 months with first episode of uncomplicated UTI, there is no clear benefit of prophylactic antibiotic. Ultrasound is the only study that is usually appropriate. After the age of 6 years, UTIs are infrequent. There is no need for routine imaging as VUR is less common. In children with recurrent or complicated UTI, in addition to ultrasound, imaging of VUR is usually appropriate. Renal cortical scintigraphy may be appropriate in children with VUR, as renal scarring may support surgical intervention. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Issues in febrile urinary tract infection management [^111t2BAs]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are common occurrences in the pediatric age group and are a cause of significant morbidity and expense. The understanding of the consequences and sequelae of febrile urinary tract infections led to revision of standard protocols initiated by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in 1999. A less invasive protocol of radiologic evaluation has been the major outcome of the revised AAP guidelines. Emphasis on prevention of recurrent febrile urinary tract infections has also led to therapeutic programs that are centered less around the use of prophylactic antibiotics than has previously been the practice.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^113wtdNf]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To revise the American Academy of Pediatrics practice parameter regarding the diagnosis and management of initial urinary tract infections (UTIs) in febrile infants and young children.

Methods

Analysis of the medical literature published since the last version of the guideline was supplemented by analysis of data provided by authors of recent publications. The strength of evidence supporting each recommendation and the strength of the recommendation were assessed and graded.

Results

Diagnosis is made on the basis of the presence of both pyuria and at least 50,000 colonies per mL of a single uropathogenic organism in an appropriately collected specimen of urine. After 7 to 14 days of antimicrobial treatment, close clinical follow-up monitoring should be maintained to permit prompt diagnosis and treatment of recurrent infections. Ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder should be performed to detect anatomic abnormalities. Data from the most recent 6 studies do not support the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent febrile recurrent UTI in infants without vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) or with grade I to IV VUR. Therefore, a voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) is not recommended routinely after the first UTI; VCUG is indicated if renal and bladder ultrasonography reveals hydronephrosis, scarring, or other findings that would suggest either high-grade VUR or obstructive uropathy and in other atypical or complex clinical circumstances. VCUG should also be performed if there is a recurrence of a febrile UTI. The recommendations in this guideline do not indicate an exclusive course of treatment or serve as a standard of care; variations may be appropriate. Recommendations about antimicrobial prophylaxis and implications for performance of VCUG are based on currently available evidence. As with all American Academy of Pediatrics clinical guidelines, the recommendations will be reviewed routinely and incorporate new evidence, such as data from the Randomized Intervention for Children With Vesicoureteral Reflux (RIVUR) study.

Conclusions

Changes in this revision include criteria for the diagnosis of UTI and recommendations for imaging.

### Long-term antibiotics for preventing recurrent urinary tract infection in children [^114KFTvZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in children. Symptoms include fever, lethargy, anorexia, and vomiting. UTI is caused by Escherichia coli in over 80% of cases and treatment is a course of antibiotics. Due to acute illness caused by UTI and the risk of pyelonephritis-induced permanent kidney damage, many children are given long-term (several months to 2 years) antibiotics aimed at preventing recurrence. This is the third update of a review first published in 2001 and updated in 2006, and 2011.

Objectives

To assess whether long-term antibiotic prophylaxis was more effective than placebo/no treatment in preventing recurrence of UTI in children, and if so which antibiotic in clinical use was the most effective. We also assessed the harms of long-term antibiotic treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 30 July 2018 through contact with the Cochrane Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Randomised comparisons of antibiotics with other antibiotics, placebo or no treatment to prevent recurrent UTI in children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed and extracted information for the initial and previous updates. A random-effects model was used to estimate risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) for recurrent UTI with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

In this update sixteen studies (2036 children randomised, 1977 analysed) were included. Seven studies (612 children) compared two or more types of antibiotics, six (1088 children) compared antibiotics with placebo or no treatment, one four-armed study compared circumcision with and without antibiotic treatment, one study compared dose of antibiotic, and one three-armed study compared two different antibiotics as well as no treatment. Of the sixteen included studies only one study was judged to be at low risk of bias for all domains, with the majority judged to be at unclear risk of bias due to very poorly reported methodology. The number of studies judged to be a low risk of bias was: selection bias (7); performance bias (4); detection bias (1); attrition bias (6); reporting bias (7); and other bias (2). The number of studies judged to be at high risk of bias was: selection bias (0); performance bias (5); detection bias (1); attrition bias (4); reporting bias (6); and other bias (1). Compared to placebo/no treatment, antibiotics lead to a modest decrease in the number of repeat symptomatic UTI in children; however the estimate from combining all studies was not certain and the confidence interval indicates low precision indicating that antibiotics may make little or no difference to risk of repeat infection (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.98). When we combined only the data from studies with concealed treatment allocation, there was a similar reduction in risk of repeat symptomatic UTI in children taking antibiotics (RR 0.68) and we have greater certainty in this estimate because of the more robust study designs, the confidence interval is smaller and it does not include the point of no effect (95% CI 0.48 to 0.95). The estimated reduction in risk of repeat symptomatic UTI for children taking antibiotics was similar in children with vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.07) compared to those without VUR (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.12) however there was considerable uncertainty due to imprecision from fewer events in the smaller group of children with VUR. There was no consistency in occurrence of adverse events, with one study having more events in the placebo group and a second study having more events in the antibiotics group. Three studies reported data for antibiotic resistance with the analysis estimating the risk of a UTI caused by a bacteria resistant to the prophylactic antibiotic being almost 2.5 times greater in children on antibiotics than for children on placebo or no treatment (RR 2.40, 95% CI 0.62 to 9.26). However the confidence interval is wide, showing imprecision and there may be little or no difference between the two groups. Eight studies involving 659 children compared one antibiotic with another but few studies compared the same combination for the same outcome so little data could be pooled. Two studies reported microbial resistance data and analysis showed that treatment with nitrofurantoin may lead to a lower risk of a UTI caused by a bacteria resistant to the treatment drug compared to children given trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole as their prophylactic treatment (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.92).

Authors' Conclusions

Long-term antibiotics may reduce the risk of repeat symptomatic UTI in children who have had one or more previous UTIs but the benefit may be small and must be considered together with the increased risk of microbial resistance.

### Comparative effectiveness of antibiotic treatment duration in children with pyelonephritis [^112M3bSK]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Pyelonephritis, an infection of the upper urinary tract, can lead to both short-term and long-term morbidity, including sepsis, acute kidney injury, renal scarring, and chronic hypertension. To alleviate symptoms during the acute phase of the infection and reduce the potential for long-term consequences, pediatric guidelines recommend treating pyelonephritis with a total of 7 to 14 days of antibiotic therapy.

A growing body of evidence supports the noninferiority of short durations of therapy (in the range of 5–7 days) compared with prolonged durations for producing clinical cure in adults with pyelonephritis. However, limited data explore this question in children. Moreover, there is a need for more robust evidence in children with urological abnomalities. The benefits of a short course of antibiotic therapy for pyelonephritis include improved patient convenience, a decreased likelihood of adverse drug events, a reduced risk of the emergence of antibiotic resistant organisms, and reduced abdominal discomfort.

Since 2016, The Johns Hopkins Hospital Pediatric Antibiotic Treatment Guidelines, accessible to clinicians at all 5 of the hospitals contributing data to the current study, recommend treating children with pyelonephritis with 7 days of antibiotic therapy (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). These guidelines were developed by a multidisciplinary team including primary care clinicians, emergency medicine clinicians, hospitalists, urologists, nephrologists, intensivists, and infectious diseases clinicians based on a review of the available evidence in adult and pediatric populations and expert opinion where gaps in data were evident. However, despite the availability of local treatment guidelines, variability remains in prescribed treatment durations for children with pyelonephritis, providing an opportunity to investigate the association between varying durations of antibiotic therapy and patient outcomes. Our objective was to compare the clinical outcomes of children receiving a short-course (< 10 days) vs a prolonged-course (≥ 10 days) of antibiotics for the treatment of pyelonephritis.

### Contemporary management of urinary tract infection in children [^116doJUG]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in children, and girls are at a significantly higher risk, as compared to boys, except in early infancy. Most cases are caused by Escherichia coli Collection of an uncontaminated urine specimen is essential for accurate diagnosis. Oral antibiotic therapy for 7 to 10 days is adequate for uncomplicated cases that respond well to the treatment. A renal ultrasound examination is advised in all young children with first febrile UTI and in older children with recurrent UTI. Most children with first febrile UTI do not need a voiding cystourethrogram; it may be considered after the first UTI in children with abnormal renal and bladder ultrasound examination or a UTI caused by atypical pathogen, complex clinical course, or known renal scarring. Long-term antibiotic prophylaxis is used selectively in high-risk patients. Few patients diagnosed with vesicoureteral reflux after a UTI need surgical correction. The most consequential long-term complication of acute pyelonephritis is renal scarring, which may increase the risk of hypertension or chronic kidney disease later in life. Treatment of acute pyelonephritis with an appropriate antibiotic within 48 hours of fever onset and prevention of recurrent UTI lowers the risk of renal scarring. Pathogens causing UTI are increasingly becoming resistant to commonly used antibiotics, and their indiscriminate use in doubtful cases of UTI must be discouraged.

Urinary tract infection — methods and evidence synthesis: To provide evidence for the guideline, 2 literature searches were conducted, including surveillance of Medline-listed literature over the past 10 years and a systematic review on the effectiveness of prophylactic antimicrobial therapy to prevent recurrence of febrile UTI/pyelonephritis in children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). The search was expanded to include trials published since 1993 comparing antimicrobial prophylaxis with no treatment or placebo for children with VUR; because all except 1 recent randomized controlled trials included children more than 24 months of age and some lacked grade-specific data, the authors of the 6 RCTs were contacted and all provided raw data from their studies specifically addressing infants 2 to 24 months of age, according to grade of VUR. Meta-analysis of these data was performed, results from the literature searches and meta-analyses were provided to committee members, evidence and recommendation strength were graded according to AAP policy, and the subcommittee formulated 7 recommendations presented in text and in algorithm form in the Appendix.

### A comparison of short versus long course intravenous antibiotics when treating urinary tract infection in infants [^111NW1XW]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common reason for hospitalization in young infants, with more than 20 000 infants (< 1 year of age) hospitalized annually in the United States. In children aged 2 to 24 months, the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines from 2011 (reaffirmed in 2016) state that "initiating treatment orally or parenterally is equally efficacious". Infants younger than 60 days often initially receive parenteral antibiotics as part of an evaluation for invasive bacterial infection. The optimal approach to intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy when a UTI is diagnosed in these younger infants is not known. As a result, significant practice heterogeneity exists both within and between institutions. -

Prescribing patterns and the appropriate duration of antibiotic therapy are a priority for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hospital systems, and individual care providers alike as it has a big impact on antimicrobial resistance. Moreover, a short-course IV therapy could provide additional potential benefits compared with a long-course therapy. Shorter hospitalizations would mean lower medical costs and increased hospital bed availability and may be less disruptive to parent-infant bonding. In addition, shorter hospitalization could reduce the risk of nosocomial infectionand adverse events, such as IV infiltrates. This approach is also in keeping with value-based health care delivery.

The goal of this study was to determine the association between short-course (≤ 3 days) and long-course (> 3 days) IV antibiotic therapies and treatment failure, defined as readmission from date of discharge within 30 days. We hypothesized that a short-course IV antibiotic therapy followed by oral antibiotics is safe, with no difference in treatment failure between short-course and long-course IV antibiotic therapy.

### Long-term antibiotics for preventing recurrent urinary tract infection in children [^111ndpQQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in children. By the age of seven years, 8.4% of girls and 1.7% of boys will have suffered at least one episode. Symptoms are systemic rather than localised in early childhood and consist of fever, lethargy, anorexia, and vomiting. UTI is caused by E. coli in over 80% of cases and treatment consists of a course of antibiotics. Due to the unpleasant acute illness caused by UTI and the risk of pyelonephritis-induced permanent kidney damage, many children are given long-term antibiotics aimed at preventing recurrence. However these medications may cause side effects and promote the development of resistant bacteria.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and side effects of long-term antibiotics given to prevent recurrent UTI in children.

Search Strategy

A search of MEDLINE (1966 to Jan 2001), EMBASE (1988 to Jan 2001) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register for relevant randomised controlled trials without language restriction; reference lists of review articles; contact with content experts.

Selection Criteria

Randomised comparisons of two or more antibiotics and placebo with one or more antibiotics to prevent recurrent UTI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed and extracted information. For each trial, information was collected on the methods of the trial, participants, interventions and outcomes. A random-effects model was used to estimate a summary relative risk (RR) and a summary risk difference (RD) for recurrent UTI. Heterogeneity tests and subgroup analyses were carried out based on a priori hypothesis of plausible effect modification.

Main Results

There were three trials (n = 151) comparing antibiotics with placebo/no treatment. The duration of antibiotic prophylaxis treatment varied among the studies (10 weeks to 12 months). The method of allocation concealment in the three trials was inadequate, unclear and adequate. The overall rate of recurrent UTI in the placebo/no treatment group was 63% (48/76). Compared to placebo/no treatment, antibiotics reduced the risk of recurrent UTI (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.77; RD -46%, 95% CI -59% to -33%). No side effects were described in any of these three trials. There was one double-blinded trial (n = 120) with unclear allocation concealment that compared two different types of antibiotics to prevent recurrent UTI. Nitrofurantoin was more effective than trimethoprim in preventing recurrent UTI over a six month period (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.92; RD -18%, 95% CI -34% to -3%). However, patients receiving nitrofurantoin were more likely to discontinue the antibiotic due to side effects (mainly gastrointestinal) than patients receiving trimethoprim (RR 3.17, 95% CI 1.36 to 7.37; RD 22%, 95% CI 8% to 36%).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Most published studies to date have been poorly designed with biases known to overestimate the true treatment effect. Large, properly randomised, double blinded trials are needed to determine the efficacy of long-term antibiotics for the prevention of UTI in susceptible children.

### Treatment of UTIs in infants [^115RRx6Q]. Hospital Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infections in infants < 2 months of age. However, there are no clear guidelines on the appropriate duration of antibiotics in this age group.

Objective

In this living systematic review, we compared different durations of parenteral antibiotics (≤ 3 vs > 3 days) in neonates and young infants (< 2 months) with UTIs. The secondary objective was to compare different durations of total antibiotic courses (≤ 10 vs > 10 days).

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde, Google Scholar, and gray literature, up to March 2, 2021.

Study Selection

Citations were screened in triplicate by using a crowdsourcing methodology, to identify randomized controlled trials and observational studies.

Data Extraction

Data were extracted by 2 crowd members and verified by an expert investigator. Outcomes were pooled via random-effects models.

Results

A total of 10334 citations were screened, and 12 eligible studies were identified. A total of 59 of 3480 (1.7% [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.3% to 2.2%]) infants had a UTI recurrence within 30 days after short parenteral treatment (≤ 3 days), and 47 of 1971 (2.4% [95% CI: 1.8% to 3.2%]) after longer courses. The pooled adjusted odds ratio for UTI recurrence with a short versus long duration of parenteral antibiotics was 1.02 (95% CI: 0.64 to 1.61; P = 0.95; n = 5451). A total of 5 studies assessed the risk of recurrence on the basis of the total duration of antibiotics (≤ 10 vs > 10 days) with no significant differences (pooled odds ratio: 1.29 [95% CI: 0.45 to 3.66; P = 0.63; n = 491).

Conclusions

On the basis of retrospective studies and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation level low evidence, short and long duration of parenteral antibiotics were associated with a similar risk of UTI recurrence in infants < 2 months.

### Urinary tract infection antibiotic trial design: a systematic review [^111b7NpP]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) represent common bacterial infections in children. No guidance on the conduct of pediatric febrile UTI clinical trials (CTs) exist.

Objective

To assess the criteria used for patient selection and the efficacy end points in febrile pediatric UTI CTs.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, Cochrane central databases, and clinicaltrials.gov were searched between January 1, 1990, and November 24, 2016.

Study Selection

We combined Medical Subject Headings terms and free-text terms for "urinary tract infections" and "therapeutics" and "clinical trials" in children (0–18 years), identifying 3086 articles.

Data Extraction

Two independent reviewers assessed study quality and performed data extraction.

Results

We included 40 CTs in which a total of 4381 cases of pediatric UTIs were investigated. Positive urine culture results and fever were the most common inclusion criteria (93% and 78%, respectively). Urine sampling method, pyuria, and colony thresholds were highly variable. Clinical and microbiological end points were assessed in 88% and 93% of the studies, respectively. Timing for end point assessment was highly variable, and only 3 studies (17%) out of the 18 performed after the Food and Drug Administration 1998 guidance publication assessed primary and secondary end points consistently with this guidance.

Limitations

Our limitations included a mixed population of healthy children and children with an underlying condition. In 6 trials, researchers studied a subgroup of patients with afebrile UTI.

Conclusions

We observed a wide variability in the microbiological inclusion criteria and the timing for end point assessment. The available guidance for adults appear not to be used by pediatricians and do not seem applicable to the childhood UTI. A harmonized design for pediatric UTIs CT is necessary.

### Short versus standard duration oral antibiotic therapy for acute urinary tract infection in children [^116fi8dJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of oral antibiotic therapy for urinary tract infection (UTI) in children has not been determined. A number of studies have compared single dose therapy to standard therapy for UTI, with mixed results. A course of antibiotics longer than a single dose but shorter than the usual 7–10 days might decrease the relapse rate and still provide some of the benefits of a shortened course of antibiotics.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the benefits and harms of short-course (2–4 days) compared to standard duration (7–14 days) oral antibiotic treatment for acute UTI in children.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2002) MEDLINE (1966 - September 2002) and EMBASE (1988 -September 2002) without language restriction.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing short-term (2–4 days) with standard (7–14 days) oral antibiotic therapy were selected if they studied children aged three months to 18 years with culture proven UTI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results expressed as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).

Main Results

Ten trials were identified in which 652 children with lower tract UTI were evaluated. There was no significant difference in the frequency of positive urine cultures between the short (2–4 days) and standard duration oral antibiotic therapy (7–14 days) for UTI in children at 0–10 days after treatment (eight studies: RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.76) and at one to 15 months after treatment (10 studies: RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.29). There was no significant difference between short and standard duration therapy in the development of resistant organisms in UTI at the end of treatment (one study: RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.01) or in recurrent UTI (three studies: RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.29).

Reviewer's Conclusions

A 2–4 day course of oral antibiotics appears to be as effective as 7–14 days in eradicating lower tract UTI in children.

### Diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections in children [^1131GCyJ]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Acute urinary tract infections are relatively common in children, with 8 percent of girls and 2 percent of boys having at least one episode by seven years of age. The most common pathogen is Escherichia coli, accounting for approximately 85 percent of urinary tract infections in children. Renal parenchymal defects are present in 3 to 15 percent of children within one to two years of their first diagnosed urinary tract infection. Clinical signs and symptoms of a urinary tract infection depend on the age of the child, but all febrile children two to 24 months of age with no obvious cause of infection should be evaluated for urinary tract infection (with the exception of circumcised boys older than 12 months). Evaluation of older children may depend on the clinical presentation and symptoms that point toward a urinary source (e.g., leukocyte esterase or nitrite present on dipstick testing; pyuria of at least 10 white blood cells per high-power field and bacteriuria on microscopy). Increased rates of E. coli resistance have made amoxicillin a less acceptable choice for treatment, and studies have found higher cure rates with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Other treatment options include amoxicillin/clavulanate and cephalosporins. Prophylactic antibiotics do not reduce the risk of subsequent urinary tract infections, even in children with mild to moderate vesicoureteral reflux. Constipation should be avoided to help prevent urinary tract infections. Ultrasonography, cystography, and a renal cortical scan should be considered in children with urinary tract infections.

### Defining effective durations of antibiotic therapy for community-acquired pneumonia and urinary tract infections in hospitalized children [^112SQDPL]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and urinary tract infections (UTI) are two common childhood infections often leading to hospital admission. National guidelines for CAP and UTI in children recommend durations of antibiotic therapy of 10 days and 7–14 days, respectively. Due to concerns of rising antimicrobial resistance and an increased awareness of harms associated with prolonged courses of antibiotics, there is a renewed emphasis on reevaluating commonly prescribed durations of antibiotic therapy across bacterial infections. We describe recent clinical trials and observational studies evaluating durations of therapy for CAP and UTI in adults and children and translate the findings to our suggested approach for selecting durations of antibiotic therapy in hospitalized children.

Recent Findings

There is a growing body of evidence, primarily in adults, that shorter durations of therapy than are commonly prescribed are just as effective as longer durations for CAP and UTIs.

Summary

Combining clinical trial data from adults with available data in children, we believe it is reasonable to consider 5 days of therapy for CAP, 3–5 days of therapy for cystitis, and 7 days of therapy for pyelonephritis for most hospitalized children with uncomplicated infections.

### Efficacy and safety of individualised versus standard 10-day antibiotic treatment in children with febrile urinary tract infection (INDI-UTI): a pragmatic, open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial in Denmark [^112amWAz]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Background

The optimal antibiotic duration for febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) in children remains uncertain. We aimed to assess whether individualised treatment was non-inferior to standard 10-day treatment in terms of recurrent UTI and superior in reducing overall antibiotic exposure.

Methods

INDI-UTI was a pragmatic, open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial conducted at eight Danish hospitals. Children aged 3 months to 12 years who were febrile (≥ 38°C), within 24 h of treatment start, and with significant growth of uropathogenic bacteria were randomly assigned (1:1) using a web-based module with randomly permuted blocks to individualised or standard 10-day treatment. Main exclusion criteria included known urinary tract abnormalities, complicated medical history, bacteraemia, and elevated serum creatinine. The individualised group stopped treatment 3 days after adequate clinical improvement (ie, absence of fever, flank pain, and dysuria), with a minimum treatment duration of 4 days. The primary outcomes were recurrent UTI within 28 days after treatment cessation (non-inferiority margin 7.5 percentage points) and total antibiotic days within 28 days of treatment initiation (superiority assessment). No sample size calculation was performed for the assessment of total antibiotic days. Safety was assessed in all included patients. Main analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05301023.

Findings

Between March 28, 2022, and March 3, 2024, 694 patients were assessed for eligibility and 408 patients were randomly assigned to individualised (n = 205; median antibiotic duration 5.3 days [IQR 4.8 to 6.5]) or standard 10-day treatment (n = 203; 10.0 days [10.0 to 10.0]). Median age was 1.5 years (IQR 0.7 to 5.4), and there were 326 (80%) female and 82 (20%) male participants. Recurrent UTI within 28 days occurred in 23 (11%) of 205 patients in the individualised group and 12 (6%) of 203 patients in the standard 10-day group (difference 5.3 percentage points, one-sided 97.5% CI -∞ to 11.1, p non_inferiority = 0.24). Total antibiotic days within 28 days were 6.0 (IQR 5.3 to 7.5) in the individualised group and 10.0 (10.0 to 10.0) in the standard 10-day group (median difference -4.0 days [97.5% CI -4.5 to -3.7], p < 0.0001). The incidence rate of antibiotic-related adverse events within 28 days was 6.8 per 100 patient-days in the individualised group and 11.1 per 100 patient-days in the standard 10-day group (rate ratio 0.61 [95% CI 0.47 to 0.80], p = 0.0003). Serious adverse events occurred in 17 (8%) of 205 patients in the individualised group and 15 (7%) of 203 patients in the standard 10-day group (difference 0.9 percentage points [95% CI -4.6 to 6.5], p = 0.79).

Interpretation

Children with febrile UTI assigned to individualised treatment duration had an increased risk of recurrent UTI (by 5.3 percentage points) but reduced antibiotic use and fewer adverse event days within 28 days compared with those assigned to standard 10-day treatment. These findings highlight the potential of individualised treatment strategies to reduce antibiotic exposure and associated harms in most children with febrile UTI, supporting antimicrobial stewardship goals. Further research is needed to identify those requiring 10-day treatment to avoid compromising care for most children with febrile UTI who respond well to shorter durations.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^117DocBi]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment durations for lower and upper UTIs have gradually reduced, but randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses of shorter durations have largely excluded children with complications. Therefore, there is scant evidence for total durations shorter than 10–14 days for cUTI.

For neonates and infants < 2 months, the majority of retrospective studies in bacteremic, and nonbacteremic,– UTI used a total of 10–14 days of antibiotics with high success rates. A recent systematic review comparing the IV component in infants up to 3 months recommended: for bacteremic UTI, IV antibiotics up to 7 days; and for nonbacteremic UTI, up to 3 days. Switching from IV to oral in both situations is recommended when the infant is afebrile, well and tolerating oral intake.

For severe clinical presentations, a retrospective study of children with febrile UTI included those with initial tachycardia, hypotension and/or vomiting. It showed that 6–9 days was as effective as ≥ 10 days of total antibiotics, although it did not report numbers with severe features. Once features of sepsis resolve (usually by day 3), total antibiotic duration is dependent on bacteremia. A multicenter study of children under 6 months with UTI found bacteremia was more likely to be treated with ≥ 4 than ≤ 3 days IV (total 7–14 days). A case-control study comparing bacteremic versus nonbacteremic UTI found a difference in IV (5–7 vs. 3–4 days) but not total (11–12 days) antibiotic duration, and no differences in outcomes. For acute lobar nephronia, a review including overlapping RCTs compared 14 versus 21 days' total duration, with initial IV then switching to oral 2–3 days after defervescence. There was higher treatment failure with 14 days, but failure was associated with longer pre-presentation fever, suggesting longer treatment is necessary for more established abscesses.

Initial management

General

Children with UTI require targeted antibiotics and supportive care. Most children with UTI can be managed at home with oral fluids and antibiotics. A small percentage will require admission for intravenous therapy, including very young and very unwell children, children with significant renal tract anomalies and children not responding to oral therapy.

Antibiotic therapy

Choice of empiric antibiotics must be guided by local guidelines, as local antimicrobial sensitivities vary significantly (table 2). The suitability of the initial agent should be reviewed once culture results are available.

Table 2
Recent evidence, controversies and emerging evidence

Oral antibiotics are effective for the overwhelming majority of paediatric UTI. Previous Cochrane reviews suggest that short 2–4 days courses are as effective as longer 7–14 days for uncomplicated cystitis, while single dose therapy is less effective. American guidelines recommend treatment durations of 7–14 days for both cystitis and pyelonephritis, Canadian guidelines recommend 7–10 days, while National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines suggests 7–10 days for pyelonephritis and a shorter 3 day course for children > 3 months with cystitis. Spanish guidelines mirror NICE recommendations though single-dose therapy is recommended for children aged > 6 years with uncomplicated cystitis.

Younger and sicker children may require initial intravenous therapy. Many guidelines and centres recommend admission, intravenous antibiotics and consideration of septic work-up for infants < 3 months. Aim to switch to oral therapy after 48 hours if there is clinical improvement.

Antibiotic resistance

Antibiotic resistant UTI is becoming more common globally, increases morbidity and doubles healthcare costs. The usual mechanism is through acquisition of enhanced beta-lactamase enzyme properties. Some Gram negative uropathogens can inactivate beta-lactam ring antibiotics such as penicillin and early generation cephalosporins with inherent beta-lactamase enzymes. However, some have acquired further multidrug-resistant properties through evolution of these enzymes, including the ability to hydrolyse and inactivate extended spectrum cephalosporins and carbapenem antibiotics. Such organisms are known as extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) organisms. Prior antibiotic therapy and hospitalisation are risk factors for ESBL carriage, which then contributes to community carriage and transmission of resistance. Rates of resistant UTIs are particularly high in resource-limited settings, where resistance to common oral antibiotics such as ampicillin and cotrimoxazole can be as high as 97%–100%.

### Short compared with standard duration of antibiotic treatment for urinary tract infection: a systematic review of randomised controlled trials [^112N8jzD]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

To compare the effectiveness of short course (2–4 days) with standard duration oral antibiotic treatment (7–14 days) for urinary tract infection (UTI).

Methods

Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials using a random effects model. Ten trials were eligible, involving 652 children with lower tract UTI recruited from outpatient or emergency departments. Main outcome measures were UTI at the end of treatment, UTI during follow up (recurrent UTI), and urinary pathogens resistant to the treating antibiotic.

Results

There was no significant difference in the frequency of positive urine cultures between the short (2–4 days) and standard duration therapy (7–14 days) for UTI in children at 0–7 days after treatment (eight studies: RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.76) and at 10 days to 15 months after treatment (10 studies: RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.33). There was no significant difference between short and standard duration therapy in the development of resistant organisms in UTI at the end of treatment (one study: RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.01) or in recurrent UTI (three studies: RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.29).

Conclusion

A 2–4 day course of oral antibiotics is as effective as 7–14 days in eradicating lower tract UTI in children.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of standard-course and short-course therapy for children with UTI.

Design, Setting, Participants

The Short Course Therapy for Urinary Tract Infections (SCOUT) randomized clinical noninferiority trial took place at outpatient clinics and emergency departments at 2 children's hospitals from May 2012, through, August 2019. Data were analyzed from January 2020, through, February 2023. Participants included children aged 2 months to 10 years with UTI exhibiting clinical improvement after 5 days of antimicrobials.

Intervention

Another 5 days of antimicrobials (standard-course therapy) or 5 days of placebo (short-course therapy).

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome, treatment failure, was defined as symptomatic UTI at or before the first follow-up visit (day 11 to 14). Secondary outcomes included UTI after the first follow-up visit, asymptomatic bacteriuria, positive urine culture, and gastrointestinal colonization with resistant organisms.

Results

Analysis for the primary outcome included 664 randomized children (639 female [96%]; median age, 4 years). Among children evaluable for the primary outcome, 2 of 328 assigned to standard-course (0.6%) and 14 of 336 assigned to short-course (4.2%) had a treatment failure (absolute difference of 3.6% with upper bound 95% CI of 5.5.%). Children receiving short-course therapy were more likely to have asymptomatic bacteriuria or a positive urine culture at or by the first follow-up visit. There were no differences between groups in rates of UTI after the first follow-up visit, incidence of adverse events, or incidence of gastrointestinal colonization with resistant organisms.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, children assigned to standard-course therapy had lower rates of treatment failure than children assigned to short-course therapy. However, the low failure rate of short-course therapy suggests that it could be considered as a reasonable option for children exhibiting clinical improvement after 5 days of antimicrobial treatment.

### Incidence of pediatric urinary tract infections before and during the COVID-19 pandemic [^116oEzoE]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common bacterial infections in childrenand the leading cause of bacterial infections in infants, yet the population incidence for all children is still largely unknown. Urinary tract infections are typically treated with antibiotics and may lead to hospitalization, genitourinary imaging, follow-up visits, and surgical intervention. Controversy remains surrounding the optimal UTI diagnostic criteria, the need for prompt diagnosis, and the role of imaging and prophylactic antibiotic therapy.,

The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with substantial decreases in health care use and viral respiratory infection transmission from social distancing measures. These shifts offer a natural experiment to gain insight into testing, treatment, and outcomes for UTI. For a nontransmissible infection such as UTI, decreased diagnosis during the pandemic would likely be primarily associated with decreased pursuit of medical care and/or a reduction in the evaluation of fever as a result of the near disappearance of most circulating viruses. Fewer UTI diagnoses during the pandemic in the face of unchanged severe outcomes may suggest that overdiagnosis and/or overtreatment were previously occurring.

While many investigations have described changes in patterns of medical care use and trends in common childhood diagnoses during the pandemic, studies have not looked specifically at the incidence of UTI diagnoses in both ambulatory and inpatient settings across community and children's hospitals. The aims of this study were to provide estimates of population-level UTI incidence and assess changes in UTI diagnoses and measures of UTI severity, such as hospitalizations and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Long-term antibiotics for preventing recurrent urinary tract infection in children [^1157AfM5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in children. By the age of seven 8.4% of girls and 1.7% of boys will have suffered at least one episode. Symptoms include fever, lethargy, anorexia, and vomiting. UTI is caused by Escherichia coli in over 80% of cases and treatment consists of a course of antibiotics. Due to acute illness caused by UTI and the risk of pyelonephritis-induced permanent kidney damage, many children are given long-term antibiotics aimed at preventing recurrence.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and harms of long-term antibiotics to prevent recurrent UTI in children.

Search Strategy

We searched without language restriction MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register, reference lists of review articles and contacted content experts. Date of most recent search: January 2006

Selection Criteria

Randomised comparisons of antibiotics with other antibiotics, placebo or no treatment to prevent recurrent UTI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed and extracted information. A random-effects model was used to estimate relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD) for recurrent UTI with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Eight studies (618 children) were identified, five (406) comparing antibiotics with placebo/no treatment. The duration of antibiotic prophylaxis treatment varied from 10 weeks to 12 months. Compared to placebo/no treatment, antibiotics reduced the risk of repeat positive urine culture (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.00; RD -30%, 95% CI -56% to -4%) No side effects were reported. One study reported that nitrofurantoin was more effective than trimethoprim in preventing recurrent UTI over a six month period (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.92; RD -18%, 95% CI -34% to -3%). However, patients receiving nitrofurantoin were more likely to discontinue the antibiotic due to side effects (mainly gastrointestinal) (RR 3.17, 95% CI 1.36 to 7.37; RD 22%, 95% CI 8% to 36%). The other study found cefixime was more effective in preventing recurrent UTI than nitrofurantoin (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.13 to 4.10; RD -3%, 95% CI -17% to -12%). However, 62% of patients receiving cefixime experienced an adverse reaction during the first six months of treatment (18/29) while only 26% (8/31) of patients receiving nitrofurantoin reported an adverse reaction.

Authors' Conclusions

Large, properly randomised, double blinded studies are needed to determine the efficacy of long-term antibiotics for the prevention of UTI in susceptible children.

### Pediatric urinary tract infections: the role of fluoroquinolones [^112HqAF8]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Infections of the urinary tract (UTI) occur commonly in the pediatric population. Because of the high association of pediatric UTI with congenital structural anomalies of the urinary tract and with dysfunctional elimination syndromes, it is far more common for children to be categorized as having complicated UTI than their adult counterparts. And for children more intensive therapy is often required. Early and effective treatment of UTIs in the pediatric patient is considered essential to prevent long term morbidity and potential mortality from end stage renal disease. An oral antimicrobial is more convenient than parenteral therapy and is preferable as long as clinical efficacy and safety can be assured. Oral fluoroquinolones are an attractive alternative for the treatment of complicated UTI in children, and safety must always be a factor in considering their use in this population. Although the role of fluoroquinolones in pediatric UTI is still under investigation, the limited data available demonstrate a likelihood of efficacy and safety.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^1155TKup]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Several studies support home IV treatment through well-resourced hospital-in-the-home programs if children are stable,– including neonates. In deciding between initial IV or oral antibiotics, the concept of complicated UTI being on a spectrum may be useful. Apart from children with sepsis, the majority with a single complicating feature are initially managed orally. Increasing the number of complicating features increases IV use, so they could be combined into a clinical score with a threshold for using IV. Outside of severe presentation, severe uropathy and neonates, clinically stable children with isolated complicating features can initially be treated with oral antibiotics.

Empiric Antibiotic Choice

Regarding empiric antibiotic choice (1) different cUTI subgroups have different uropathogen prevalence and (2) an individualized risk assessment for resistance is needed based on the child's underlying condition, prior antibiotic use and hospitalization. Based on these, an empiric regimen can be chosen that covers likely pathogens and incorporates the likelihood of resistance (GRADES C and D).
Patients with recurrent infections may initially be treated based on previous cultures (GRADE D).
For children on antibiotic prophylaxis, a different antibiotic choice is needed (GRADE C).
Targeted de-escalated monotherapy is recommended according to susceptibilities once available (GRADE D).

Each cUTI subgroup is vulnerable to different pathogens, and assessment for unusual and multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria is crucial. Risk factors for ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) include recurrent UTI, VUR, recent antibiotic exposure, young age and Klebsiella spp. – Risk factors for more resistant carbapenemase-producing uropathogens are prolonged hospitalization, invasive devices and recent travel to endemic areas. – Empiric antibiotic choice needs to balance the risk of resistance with the need for antimicrobial stewardship for this common infection, potentially accepting a short delay in definitive treatment for children who are hemodynamically stable.

AAP urinary tract infection guideline — febrile infants and young children 2–24 months of age: Action Statement 1 states that if a clinician decides that a febrile infant with no apparent source for the fever requires antimicrobial therapy to be administered because of ill appearance or another pressing reason, the clinician should ensure that a urine specimen is obtained for both culture and urinalysis before an antimicrobial is administered; the specimen needs to be obtained through catheterization or suprapubic aspiration (SPA), because the diagnosis of UTI cannot be established reliably through culture of urine collected in a bag (evidence quality: A; strong recommendation).

### Evaluation and treatment of urinary tract infections in children… [^1138hAiC]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Therapeutic trials in children with UTI are rare and poorly controlled. 32 Thus, controversy regarding dosage or length of therapy with antimicrobials continues. In patients who appear toxic, it is reasonable to initiate treatment with intravenous antibiotics and follow them closely for signs and symptoms of infection; these usually resolve in three to five days. 33 Initial antibiotic therapy should be based on age, clinical severity, location of infection, presence of structural abnormalities, and allergy to certain antibiotics. Treatment generally begins with a broad-spectrum antibiotic, but it may need to be changed based on the results of urine culture and sensitivity testing. 1 Evidence is lacking for the use of short-course therapy in children with UTI. 26 Although conventional therapy lasts seven to 10 days, a three- to seven-day trial of oral antibiotics has been suggested for uncomplicated infection of the lower urinary tract.

32 Reasonable choices for initial inpatient and outpatient oral antibiotic therapy are shown in. 1 With careful monitoring for side effects, a prophylactic trial of a single nightly dose of nitrofurantoin, 1 to 2 mg per kg per day, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 2 mg per kg of trimetho-prim per day, may be used for six months or more. 8 Using low doses of antibiotics for prophylaxis has a theoretic advantage since this may minimize serum levels and subsequent enteric bacterial resistance while urinary concentration of the antibiotic remains high enough to maintain sterile urine.
14. In any child with systemic signs of illness, treatment with parenteral antibiotics should be initiated, and after clinical improvement, therapy should be switched to oral antibiotics for 10 to 14 days.

Diagnostic imaging with ultrasound and renal cortical scintigraphy should be considered to document the presence of pyelonephritis or renal scarring; voiding cystourethrography should be performed when the urine is sterile and the patient is clinically improved. Further management is dictated by the clinical course and findings on medical imaging. In all patients less than five years of age with no systemic signs and in boys over age five with no systemic signs, treatment with oral antibiotics should be carried out for 10 to 14 days. Afterward, diagnostic imaging with ultrasound and voiding cystourethrogram should be considered. Further management is dictated by findings on diagnostic imaging and clinical course.

### Urinary tract infection at the age extremes: pediatrics and geriatrics [^112KTmNx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common and generally benign conditions among healthy, sexually active young women without long-term medical sequelae. In contrast, UTIs are more complicated among those individuals at either end of the age spectrum: infants/young children and geriatrics. UTI in children younger than 2 years has been associated with significant morbidity and long-term medical consequences, necessitating an extensive and somewhat invasive imaging evaluation to identify possible underlying functional or anatomic abnormalities. Pediatric UTI should be considered complicated until proved otherwise, and treatment should reflect the severity of signs and symptoms. Management in the acutely ill child frequently involves parenteral broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, and less ill children can be treated with trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), beta-lactams, and cephalosporins.UTI among older patients (> 65 years) may be complicated by comorbidities, the baseline presence of asymptomatic bacteriuria, and benign urinary symptoms that can complicate diagnosis. The etiology of UTI encompasses a broader spectrum of infecting organisms than is seen among younger patients and includes more gram-positive organisms. Symptomatic UTI is generally more difficult to treat than among younger populations. Management should be conservative, of longer treatment durations, and cover a broad spectrum of possible uropathogens. Oral or parenteral treatment with a fluoroquinolone for 7 days is the preferred empiric approach. TMP-SMX can also be considered a first-line agent in women only, but only if the pathogen is known to be TMP-SMX sensitive.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^1141U6vd]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Common uropathogens in children with significant urologic abnormalities, including postsurgery and instrumentation, are Enterobacterales, P. aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus.– To cover these, if IV antibiotics are needed, an aminoglycoside or broad-spectrum cephalosporin is recommended, with a child's individual history guiding whether to cover rarer S. aureus or more indolent Enterococcus spp. empirically. Where multiple antibiotics have previously been used, assessment of the likelihood of resistance is part of management (see below).

Multiple recurrent UTIs, defined by 2 or more UTIs caused by different organisms, are a risk for resistant and MDR bacteria. Although recurrent UTIs might occur without anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract, other risk factors include VUR, underlying neurological conditions, prolonged hospitalization and UTI prophylaxis, and girls are at higher risk than boys. If on prophylaxis, a different treatment antibiotic is required due to breakthrough. For children at high risk of resistance, including suspected ESBL-E, empiric oral options include nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, quinolones and fosfomycin. Empirical IV options for children at moderate risk of resistance but who have never cultured ESBL-E include gentamicin and quinolones. If there has been previous ESBL-E or clinical risk is higher, IV amikacin retains high susceptibility to uropathogens, concentrates well in urine and can avoid broad-spectrum beta-lactam and carbapenem use. Most gentamicin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae exhibit cross-resistance to tobramycin but remain susceptible to amikacin, due to reduced inactivation by bacterial enzymes. If cultures grow Klebsiella pneumoniae with high bacterial inoculum, empirical B-lactam antibiotics should be switched to a different class. With a high bacterial inoculum, the stationary phase is rapidly reached, so the effect of targeting penicillin-binding proteins is rapidly diminished, and an alternative is better. In the large majority, carbapenems should be spared since their use is the greatest risk for developing carbapenem resistance. Even with a history of recurrent UTI with resistant uropathogens, empirical carbapenems are rarely needed in children with cUTI unless a child presents with sepsis (see below). – If the identified uropathogen is MDR, including carbapenem-resistant, options include a carbapenem plus amikacin combination, colistin and newer B-lactam/B-lactamase antibiotics such as ceftazidime-avibactam. Since methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is an uncommon uropathogen, this rarely needs to be covered empirically. P. aeruginosa (susceptible and resistant) is more common in recurrent UTIs, so it should be empirically treated with oral quinolones or IV aminoglycosides.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^1121mZzi]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics pediatric UTI diagnosis — Action Statement 1 states that "the clinician should ensure that a urine specimen is obtained for both culture and urinalysis before an antimicrobial agent is administered; the specimen needs to be obtained through catheterization or SPA, because the diagnosis of UTI cannot be established reliably through culture of urine collected in a bag" (evidence quality: A; strong recommendation). Urine obtained through catheterization for culture has "a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 99%", and SPA success rates have been "reported (23%–90%)" with improvement "when ultrasonographic guidance is used". For bag-collected urine, cultures "have an unacceptably high false-positive rate and are valid only when they yield negative results"; at a "prevalence of UTI of 5%" and "specificity: ~63%", a positive bag culture "would be a false-positive result 88% of the time", and in febrile boys at "2%" prevalence the false-positive rate "is 95%"; for circumcised boys at "0.2%", it "is 99%". Therefore, "in cases in which antimicrobial therapy will be initiated, catheterization or SPA is required to establish the diagnosis of UTI". Supporting judgments include "Aggregate quality of evidence: A (diagnostic studies on relevant populations)", "Harms/risks/costs: Catheterization is invasive", "Benefit-harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm", and the value judgment that "it is important to have the most-accurate test for UTI performed initially".

### Reaffirmation of AAP clinical practice guideline: the diagnosis and management of the initial urinary tract infection in febrile infants and young children 2–24 months of age [^115rWDXz]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

AAP clinical practice guideline — Action Statement 2 (assessment and initial testing pathway): If a clinician assesses a febrile infant with no apparent source for the fever as not being so ill as to require immediate antimicrobial therapy, then the clinician should assess the likelihood of UTI. If the clinician determines the febrile infant to have a low likelihood of UTI, then clinical follow-up monitoring without testing is sufficient (evidence quality: A; strong recommendation). If the clinician determines that the febrile infant is not in a low-risk group, then there are 2 choices (evidence quality: A; strong recommendation): Option 1 is to obtain a urine specimen through catheterization or SPA for culture and urinalysis; Option 2 is to obtain a urine specimen through the most convenient means and to perform a urinalysis, proceeding to catheterization or SPA and culture if urinalysis suggests UTI, whereas if urinalysis of fresh (less than 1 hour since void) urine yields negative leukocyte esterase and nitrite results, it is reasonable to monitor the clinical course without initiating antimicrobial therapy, recognizing that a negative urinalysis does not rule out a UTI with certainty. When illness severity and UTI risk are extremely low, the patient may be observed without assessing the urine, and this 2-step process (Option 2) has been shown feasible and beneficial in a pediatric emergency department, with the catheterization rate decreasing from 63% to fewer than 30% without increasing length of stay or missing UTIs.

### Comparative effectiveness of antibiotic treatment duration in children with pyelonephritis [^115553XN]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Our findings suggest that children receiving a short course (median 8 days) vs a prolonged course (median 11 days) of antibiotic therapy for the treatment of pyelonephritis experience similar clinical outcomes. Although results did not achieve statistical significance, children who received a short course of antibiotic therapy may be less likely to have subsequent infections within the following 30 days with a more resistant strain of the same uropathogen (40% vs 64%). This finding adds to the growing body of evidence supporting shorter durations of therapy than traditionally prescribed for the treatment of common bacterial infections.

To our knowledge, this is the first comparative effectiveness research study evaluating the optimal duration of therapy for pyelonephritis in children. Our data provide evidence that may help guide treatment recommendations for a common pediatric infection, particularly when combined with the high-quality randomized clinical trial data supporting shorter (5–7 days) durations of therapy for adults with pyelonephritis. Furthermore, our study included populations frequently excluded from traditional comparative effectiveness UTI studies, including those with immunocompromised systems, structural urologic abnormalities, and previous UTIs, increasing the generalizability of our findings to the pediatric population at highest risk for the development of pyelonephritis.

We found that children aged 4 to 13 years had a significantly higher odds of treatment failure (regardless of the duration of therapy prescribed) than children aged less than 4 years or greater than 14 years. We hypothesize that this finding was likely due to differences in risk factors in the aged 4 to 13 years group compared with younger and older children. A possible explanation for the development of UTIs in healthy children less than aged 4 years is evolving elimination and hygiene practices during infancy and toilet training periods; whereas children older than 14 years are more likely to experience UTIs related to sexual activity. Children between these ages, however, are less likely to develop UTIs unless there are anatomical abnormalities of the urinary tract, neurological abnormalities, or functional bowel control conditions. The presence of underlying urologic abnormalities was independently associated with treatment failure, regardless of the duration of therapy prescribed.

### AAP perspective: race-based medicine [^112DFKYg]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) urinary tract infection clinical practice guideline — retirement and rationale: In May 2021, the AAP Board of Directors voted unanimously to immediately retire the guideline "Urinary Tract Infection: Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of the Initial UTI in Febrile Infants and Children 2 to 24 Months" because of improper use of race as a factor in disease risk. The guideline was first published in 2011 and reaffirmed in 2016, and concerns raised in January 2020 stated it "systematically indicates differential care for black or non-white children based on a theoretical lower risk of UTI".

### Antibiotic resistance in children with E. coli urinary tract infection [^114akPFB]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

The World Health Organization's 2014 global action plan on antimicrobial resistance outlines a strategy to deal with the effects of these multiple individual actions. The plan asks nations to adopt "whole of society" approaches to prevention (through public health and infection control measures), to enhance and better disseminate knowledge on antimicrobial resistance, and to develop an economic case for new investments in drugs, diagnostic tools, and vaccines.

Bryce and colleagues' systematic review joins a host of recent studies, reports, and calls to action on this issue. Each adds evidence to justify change in how we protect a precious global resource. While I have no doubt that clinical practice guidelines will quickly be able to accommodate the findings, I am less confident that there is the will and commitment to deal with what the WHO has called "the post-antibiotic era".

RESULTS

What Is the Definition of cUTI?

cUTI is most usefully defined as children with UTI with an increased likelihood of failing conventional management (GRADE D).
Children with cUTI have one or more of: localized risk: significant anatomical or functional urological abnormality, multiple recurrent UTI, generalized risk: neonates, nonurological underlying condition (renal and nonrenal) and severe clinical presentations: sepsis, severe renal parenchymal disease.
We have used "complicated" to define subgroups at presentation and consequent management recommendations and "atypical" to refer to unexpected clinical progress (GRADE D).

The term "complicated UTI" has been used to describe multiple different UTI syndromes, with additional characteristics that might complicate the usual UTI course, variably including severe clinical presentations with or without extensive tissue involvement, hosts with abnormal urology or other underlying conditions and unusual pathogen properties. This variety makes it difficult to compare studies and provide consistent evidence in guidelines for the management of cUTI. UTI has traditionally been categorized as uncomplicated (uUTI) and complicated (cUTI) to standardize trial participants, but due to the lack of specific and clearly defined criteria at the outset, the definition has become increasingly broad and ambiguous. In a recent systematic review in adults, cUTI was variably defined by host factors and systemic involvement, a combination of both or neither. In children, early attempts to define cUTI variably included all neonates, most children with pyelonephritis, children with known anatomical or functional abnormalities, extensive parenchymal involvement, septicemia, nosocomial acquisition, renal impairment and recent antibiotics. The limited number of pediatric studies addressing cUTI (Table S1, Supplemental Digital Content 1a, and 1b,), have used various definitions, from comprehensive to brief to single complication.– Regarding the cUTI definition in existing guidelines for childhood UTI management, the updated National Institute for Clinical Excellence guideline for childhood UTIand recent Canadianand Swissguidelines used varying combinations of severe presentation, renal issues and failure to improve in their definitions, while the Italian Society of Pediatric Nephrologyuses severe presentation as the only criterion.

### Technical report-diagnosis and management of an initial UTI in febrile infants and young children [^112uqQgp]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in young children are clinically challenging. This report was developed to inform the revised, evidence-based, clinical guideline regarding the diagnosis and management of initial UTIs in febrile infants and young children, 2 to 24 months of age, from the American Academy of Pediatrics Subcommittee on Urinary Tract Infection.

Methods

The conceptual model presented in the 1999 technical report was updated after a comprehensive review of published literature. Studies with potentially new information or with evidence that reinforced the 1999 technical report were retained. Meta-analyses on the effectiveness of antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent recurrent UTI were performed.

Results

Review of recent literature revealed new evidence in the following areas. Certain clinical findings and new urinalysis methods can help clinicians identify febrile children at very low risk of UTI. Oral antimicrobial therapy is as effective as parenteral therapy in treating UTI. Data from published, randomized controlled trials do not support antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent febrile UTI when vesicoureteral reflux is found through voiding cystourethrography. Ultrasonography of the urinary tract after the first UTI has poor sensitivity. Early antimicrobial treatment may decrease the risk of renal damage from UTI.

Conclusions

Recent literature agrees with most of the evidence presented in the 1999 technical report, but meta-analyses of data from recent, randomized controlled trials do not support antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent febrile UTI. This finding argues against voiding cystourethrography after the first UTI.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^114u2fnH]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline — initial urinary tract infection (UTI) in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months — states that diagnosis is made on the basis of the presence of both pyuria and at least 50 000 colonies per mL of a single uropathogenic organism in an appropriately collected specimen of urine. After 7 to 14 days of antimicrobial treatment, close clinical follow-up monitoring should be maintained to permit prompt diagnosis and treatment of recurrent infections. Ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder should be performed to detect anatomic abnormalities. Data from the most recent 6 studies do not support the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent febrile recurrent UTI in infants without vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) or with grade I to IV VUR. Therefore, a voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) is not recommended routinely after the first UTI; VCUG is indicated if renal and bladder ultrasonography reveals hydronephrosis, scarring, or other findings that would suggest either high-grade VUR or obstructive uropathy and in other atypical or complex clinical circumstances, and VCUG should also be performed if there is a recurrence of a febrile UTI. This Clinical Practice Guideline was retired May 2021.

### Global prevalence of antibiotic resistance in paediatric urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli and association with routine use of antibiotics in primary care: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113UcpBW]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Policy, clinical, and research implications

Our findings detail global high level resistance to some of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics for children primary care, which could result in several drugs becoming ineffective first line treatments in many countries. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in collaboration with the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID)recommend that an antibiotic should be selected for first line empirical treatment of urinary tract infection only if the local prevalence of resistance is less than 20%. According to these guidelines, our review suggests ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, and trimethoprim are no longer suitable first line treatment options for urinary tract infection in many OECD countries and that as a result many guidelines, such as those published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), might need updating. In non-OECD countries, resistance to all first line antibiotics specified for urinary tract infections was in excess of 20% (appendix 5), suggesting that choices of first line treatment might need to be re-evaluated in less well developed countries. Our results also support the need for prescribing guidelines to reflect patterns of local resistance and that, for many areas, nitrofurantoin might be the most appropriate first line treatment for lower urinary tract infection. That said, care is needed because ruling out the use of some first line antibiotics could lead clinicians to prescribe broad spectrum second line antibiotics, such as co-amoxiclav, cephalosporins, and quinolones, resulting in a vicious cycle of increasing use of broad spectrum antibiotics and bacterial resistance.

### Fluconazole dose recommendation in urinary tract infection [^115b1hPY]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify the most appropriate dose of fluconazole for the treatment of symptomatic fungal urinary tract infection (UTI).

Data Sources

Primary literature identified through MEDLINE (1990-June 2000). Key search terms included fluconazole and urinary tract infection.

Data Synthesis

Fluconazole is approved for the treatment of candidal UTIs, but dosage recommendations are not consistent. An evaluation of clinical studies of fluconazole for the treatment of candidal UTI was performed.

Conclusions

Questions remain about the optimal dosing of fluconazole, including the most appropriate dose in non-albicans species of candida as well as the optimal duration of therapy. Until further studies are performed, a fluconazole 200-mg loading dose followed by 100 mg/d for at least four days appears to be the most appropriate dose for the treatment of symptomatic candidal UTI in patients without systemic fungal infection or severe renal failure.

AAP urinary tract infection (UTI) guideline — diagnostic thresholds and pyuria: For urine obtained by catheterization, 50 000 cfu/ml was proposed as the appropriate threshold; lower colony counts are sufficient if obtained by SPA, and most (80%) cases of UTI documented with urine obtained by SPA have 10⁵ cfu/ mL or more. Colony counts lower than 50 000 cfu/mL are currently being considered for the diagnosis of UTI if 10 000 cfu/ml is coupled with symptoms (eg, fever) and evidence of inflammation (pyuria), and significant pyuria is ≥ 10 white blood cells/mm³ on an "enhanced urinalysis" or ≥ 5 white blood cells per high power field on a centrifuged specimen of urine or any leukocyte esterase on a dipstick.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^113fPgyt]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria in infancy — An important cause of bacteriuria without pyuria is asymptomatic bacteriuria, which can occur in infants. In a study of infants 2 to 24 months of age, 0.7% of afebrile girls had 3 successive urine cultures with 105 CFUs per mL of a single uropathogen; this condition can be confused with true UTI but should be distinguished because studies suggest antimicrobial treatment may do more harm than good, and the key discriminator is the presence of pyuria.

### Empiric use of cefepime in the treatment of serious urinary tract infections in children [^111p2SHG]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in childhood. They represent a significant proportion (10%) of hospital-acquired infections in children. Bacteria causing UTIs in children vary, depending on the setting (community-acquired vs. nosocomial), underlying anatomic anomalies and concurrent medical conditions.

Objective

To review published and unpublished clinical studies that have used cefepime for the treatment of UTIs in children.

Methods and Results

In two recent multicenter, randomized trials, cefepime (50 mg/kg/dose every 8 h and every 12 h) was compared with ceftazidime (50 mg/kg/dose every 8 h) for the treatment of serious urinary tract infections including pyelonephritis in children less than 12 years of age. In these studies a favorable clinical and microbiologic response was observed in > 95% of cefepime-treated and ceftazidime-treated children assessed at the end of treatment.

Conclusions

These results indicate that cefepime represents an important therapeutic option for the treatment of serious UTIs in children.
