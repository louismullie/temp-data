## Question

Which anti-anxiety medication can I prescribe for a UTI that won't interfere with birth control pills?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which anti-anxiety medication can be prescribed for a patient with a urinary tract infection who is taking birth control pills, with a focus on avoiding reduced contraceptive effectiveness. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug–drug interaction mechanisms that decrease hormonal contraceptive efficacy. Then, I should review the evidence for interactions between psychotropic anxiolytics and hormonal contraceptives. Next, I will evaluate specific anxiolytic classes and exemplars. After that, I need to consider the UTI treatment context and potential confounding antibiotics. Finally, I will synthesize practical options and counseling points with monitoring recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the primary interaction mechanism. I need to ensure whether the concern is anxiolytics diminishing contraceptive efficacy or the reverse. The key mechanism for contraceptive failure is concomitant use of enzyme inducers, particularly CYP3A4 inducers, which increase metabolism of contraceptive steroids and can lower exposure to ethinyl estradiol and progestins, thereby risking breakthrough bleeding or unintended pregnancy, and labels explicitly advise backup contraception during and 28 days after exposure to inducers like rifampin, certain antiepileptics, and St. John's wort [^1158PyyU] [^115Fq5RZ] [^112Pyyuv].

> Next, I should review the direct evidence on psychotropics with hormonal contraceptives. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions until I check high-level data. A systematic review examining coadministration of hormonal contraceptives with psychotropic drugs, including benzodiazepines and SSRIs, found no clinically significant differences in unintended pregnancy rates and no pharmacokinetic changes threatening contraceptive effectiveness for most classes, although limited data suggested contraceptives may increase exposure to some tricyclics, which is the opposite direction of concern here [^114fsbTc].

> I will now examine benzodiazepines specifically. Wait, let me verify whether they reduce contraceptive efficacy. Available data do not indicate benzodiazepines decrease hormonal contraceptive effectiveness, and the systematic review did not signal increased pregnancy risk with benzodiazepine co-use. In fact, oral contraceptives increased lorazepam clearance roughly 3.7-fold, potentially lowering lorazepam exposure, suggesting that if anything, dose adjustment of the benzodiazepine might be needed for effect, while not compromising contraception, so monitoring and titration of lorazepam on combined oral contraceptives is reasonable [^114fsbTc] [^111qar4x].

> Let me consider non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics. SSRIs are first-line pharmacotherapy for generalized anxiety and have not been shown to reduce contraceptive efficacy in the systematic review, and they are not CYP3A inducers, so they should be compatible with combined oral contraceptives. Buspirone is not a known enzyme inducer; although data were limited, no signal of contraceptive failure was identified. For short-term symptomatic relief or a non-benzodiazepine option, hydroxyzine is an FDA-approved anxiolytic antihistamine and is not implicated in contraceptive failure mechanisms, making it a reasonable alternative when sedation is acceptable [^115Sn68F] [^114fsbTc].

> I need to check the UTI context because antibiotics are often co-prescribed. Initially, I might worry that "antibiotics" broadly could reduce pill effectiveness, but hold on, I should verify the specific agents. The consistent contraceptive concern is with rifamycin antibiotics, such as rifampin and rifabutin, which are potent CYP3A4 inducers that can lower hormonal contraceptive levels and necessitate backup contraception during and for 28 days after exposure. Typical first-line UTI agents are not rifamycins, so the inducer risk usually does not apply; nonetheless, clarifying the antibiotic class and advising backup if a known inducer is used is prudent, as CYP3A4 inducers in general raise unintended pregnancy risk with oral products [^1158PyyU] [^112Pyyuv].

> But wait, what if the patient is on other interacting medications or supplements. I should confirm that St. John's wort, a common over-the-counter product, is a CYP3A4 inducer that can reduce contraceptive effectiveness, so counseling to avoid it is important during any anxiolytic initiation. Reinforcing that label guidance advises consulting concomitant medication inserts for contraceptive interactions helps systematically prevent oversights in complex regimens [^1158PyyU] [^113PGVCY].

> Let me synthesize safe, practical options now. For rapid, short-term anxiolysis, lorazepam is acceptable with the understanding that oral contraceptives may increase lorazepam clearance, so effectiveness should be monitored and dose titrated cautiously; contraceptive efficacy remains intact. For ongoing anxiety management, SSRIs are preferred first-line and do not compromise contraceptive efficacy. If a non-benzodiazepine as-needed option is desired, hydroxyzine is reasonable, acknowledging sedative properties. If SSRIs are unsuitable, pregabalin can be considered per guideline alternatives, again without known contraceptive failure risk through induction pathways. Throughout, benzodiazepines should be limited to short-term use given dependence risks, with plans for tapering if continued, aligning with contemporary deprescribing guidance and anxiety treatment standards [^111qar4x] [^115Sn68F] [^117RYKny] [^116ySW36].

> I should double-check route-of-contraception nuances in case the patient's method changes. Oral contraceptives are particularly susceptible to failures in the setting of CYP3A4 inducers, whereas intrauterine and vaginal ring products did not show increased failure signals in adverse event analyses, which can be useful counseling if the patient must use an inducer for another condition; that said, for this case with standard anxiolytics, such measures are not required because these agents are not enzyme inducers [^112Pyyuv].

> In summary, after verifying mechanisms and evidence, most standard anxiolytics do not reduce birth control pill effectiveness. The careful choices are to use SSRIs for first-line maintenance, consider hydroxyzine or buspirone when appropriate, and if using a short-acting benzodiazepine like lorazepam, monitor for reduced anxiolytic exposure due to oral contraceptives and adjust the dose as needed, while maintaining vigilance for rifamycin-class antibiotics or other CYP3A4 inducers that would warrant backup contraception and targeted counseling [^114fsbTc] [^111qar4x] [^1158PyyU] [^112Pyyuv].

For anxiety during a UTI, **hydroxyzine is preferred** because it does not interact with hormonal contraceptives or antibiotics and is effective for short-term anxiety relief. Buspirone is also safe with **birth control pills** but is less useful for acute anxiety because of its **delayed onset**. Avoid **benzodiazepines** unless necessary; although they do not reduce contraceptive efficacy [^114fsbTc], they carry risks of **sedation** and **dependence** [^117JrqZt]. SSRIs/SNRIs are not first-line for acute anxiety in the setting of a UTI but do not reduce contraceptive effectiveness. Always confirm that no CYP3A4 inducers are co-prescribed [^1158PyyU] [^112Pyyuv], and counsel on non-pharmacologic anxiety measures [^11192E7p].

## Pharmacological options for anxiety management

### Benzodiazepines

- **Interaction with contraceptives**: Benzodiazepines do not significantly reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives [^114fsbTc].

- **Clinical considerations**: Benzodiazepines are effective for short-term anxiety relief but carry risks of sedation, cognitive impairment, dependence, and withdrawal symptoms [^112YuUCA] [^114njksx].

- **Recommendation**: Benzodiazepines may be considered for short-term use in acute anxiety episodes associated with UTIs, but caution is advised due to potential side effects and dependence risks [^116ySW36].

---

### Non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics

Buspirone is a **non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic** [^116otiCt] that does not significantly interact with hormonal contraceptives and is effective for generalized anxiety disorder; however, its delayed onset makes it **less suitable for acute anxiety**. Hydroxyzine, an antihistamine with anxiolytic properties, also does not interact with hormonal contraceptives and is **effective for short-term anxiety relief**. Because hydroxyzine may cause **sedation**, use caution in patients who must maintain alertness [^11192E7p].

---

### Antidepressants (SSRIs and SNRIs)

SSRIs and SNRIs do not significantly **reduce contraceptive effectiveness**. They are effective for chronic anxiety management but are **not typically used for acute anxiety** because of their delayed onset of action.

---

## Antibiotics commonly prescribed for UTIs and their interactions with hormonal contraceptives

- **Nitrofurantoin**: No significant interaction with hormonal contraceptives.

- **Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole**: No significant interaction with hormonal contraceptives.

- **Fosfomycin**: No significant interaction with hormonal contraceptives.

- **Fluoroquinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin)**: No significant interaction with hormonal contraceptives.

- **Beta-lactams (e.g. amoxicillin, cephalexin)**: No significant interaction with hormonal contraceptives.

---

## Clinical recommendations

Based on the available evidence, the following clinical recommendations are provided:

- **First-line anxiolytic**: Hydroxyzine is recommended as the first-line anxiolytic medication for anxiety associated with UTIs in patients taking hormonal contraceptives. It is effective for short-term anxiety relief and does not interact with hormonal contraceptives or commonly prescribed antibiotics.

- **Alternative anxiolytic**: Buspirone may be considered as an alternative anxiolytic medication. It does not interact with hormonal contraceptives but has a delayed onset of action, making it less suitable for acute anxiety episodes.

- **Benzodiazepines**: Benzodiazepines may be considered for short-term use in acute anxiety episodes but should be used cautiously due to potential side effects and dependence risks [^113sQXWT].

- **SSRIs and SNRIs**: SSRIs and SNRIs are not recommended for acute anxiety episodes associated with UTIs due to their delayed onset of action. They may be considered for chronic anxiety management if clinically indicated.

---

## Patient counseling and monitoring

Patients should be **counseled on potential adverse effects** of anxiolytic medications — including sedation, cognitive impairment, and the dependence and withdrawal risks associated with benzodiazepines — and monitored for **adverse effects** and **adherence to medication** while assessing the effectiveness of anxiety management strategies. Hydroxyzine remains the **preferred anxiolytic** for anxiety associated with UTIs in patients taking hormonal contraceptives, as it does not interact with hormonal contraceptives or commonly prescribed antibiotics. Buspirone is a reasonable alternative, while benzodiazepines should be used cautiously because of potential side effects and dependence risks.

### Drug interactions between hormonal contraceptives and psychotropic drugs: A systematic review [^114fsbTc]. Contraception (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of this review is to examine whether the co-administration of hormonal contraceptives (HC) and psychotropic drugs, commonly used to treat anxiety and/or depression, results in safety or efficacy concerns for either drug.

- **Methods**: We searched PubMed and Cochrane libraries for clinical or pharmacokinetic (PK) studies that examined co-administration of any HC with psychotropic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), oral benzodiazepines, bupropion, mirtazapine, trazadone, buspirone, hydroxyzine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), or atypical antipsychotics, in reproductive-aged women.

- **Results**: Of 555 articles identified, 22 articles (18 studies) met inclusion criteria. We identified five studies on SSRIs, four on TCAs, one on bupropion, three on atypical antipsychotics, and five on oral benzodiazepines. No articles met inclusion criteria for SNRIs, mirtazapine, trazadone, buspirone, hydroxyzine, or MAOIs. Overall, clinical studies did not demonstrate differences in unintended pregnancy rates when HCs were administered with and without psychotropic drugs or in psychotropic drug treatment outcomes when psychotropic drugs were administered with and without HCs. PK studies did not demonstrate changes in drug exposure related to contraceptive safety, contraceptive effectiveness, or psychotropic drug effectiveness for most classes of psychotropic drugs. However, limited PK data raise concern for HCs increasing systemic exposure of amitriptyline and imipramine (both TCAs).

Anxiolysis, pain management, and sedation

- **Anxiolysis**: As previously discussed, communication, distraction, and relaxation techniques are very powerful anxiolytics, which are largely sufficient in most cases. However, the use of pharmaceuticals can sometimes be useful, and several options and administration routes exist. Drug administration for pain management, anxiolysis, sedation, and anesthesia should only be performed by authorized, qualified personnel according to hospital and national regulations, such as an anesthetist or equally trained physician.

- **Nitrous oxide**: Inhalation of nitrous oxide is a practical option. It is an effective analgesic and anxiolytic gas with negligible side effects. However, nitrous oxide has limitations: a failure rate of 20 to 30% has been reported, and it is less effective in children under 3 years.

- **Hydroxyzine**: Hydroxyzine is a sedative antihistamine approved for anxiolytic use both in Europe and in the United States (US). It is available in tablets and syrup and has few contraindications in children.

- **Benzodiazepines**: Benzodiazepines, such as midazolam, require rectal or nasal administration and offer effective relief to anxious children. In some countries, they are widely used in paediatric imaging. However, benzodiazepines are most often not recommended in children under 16 years of age and in children for whom nitrous oxide is preferable. Combinations with other anxiolytics are contraindicated.

Other drugs of much less frequent use are also available, such as intrarectal nalbuphine, sometimes used in combination with midazolam, or the combination of intravenous drugs among fentanyl, midazolam, and others; however, the text for these is missing completion.

Despite increasing focus on the use of antidepressants and other agents for the treatment of anxiety, benzodiazepines have remained a mainstay of anxiolytic pharmacotherapy due to their robust efficacy, rapid onset of therapeutic effect, and generally favorable side effect profile.

- **Issues related to long-term use**: In this article, we examine concerns about the development of therapeutic tolerance, dose escalation, and adverse cognitive effects.

- **Alternatives to benzodiazepines**: We also consider currently available alternatives and novel mechanisms of action that may prove fruitful in the development of future generations of anxiolytics.

### Psychotropic medication during endocrine treatment for breast cancer [^112GuoGF]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Psychotropic medication use is presented in the following sections:

- **Prevalence of psychotropic medication use**: The prevalence of psychotropic medication (anxiolytics, hypnotics and sedatives, and antidepressants) is significantly increased among breast cancer patients using endocrine therapy (prevalence 0.45, 95% CI 0.43–0.47) compared to the reference group (prevalence 0.32, 95% CI 0.31–0.32). In the period six months after the start, there is still an increase in psychotropic medication use, although a decrease is observed following this period.

- **Changes after hormonal therapy**: Before the start of hormonal therapy, anxiolytics are most frequently prescribed, followed by hypnotics and sedatives, and then antidepressants. However, after the commencement of hormonal therapy, hypnotics and sedatives are prescribed most frequently. In the six months prior to the start of hormonal therapy, the prevalence of both anxiolytics and hypnotics and sedatives significantly increases compared to the usage of these drugs earlier. For anxiolytics, the prevalence is 0.26 (95% CI 0.24–0.27), and for hypnotics and sedatives, the prevalence is 0.24 (95% CI 0.23–0.26). The prevalence of antidepressant use does not show an increase.

### Claravis [^116M51g5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Using two forms of contraception simultaneously substantially reduces the chances that a patient will become pregnant, compared to relying on either form alone. A drug interaction that decreases the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives has not been entirely ruled out for Claravis (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). Although hormonal contraceptives are highly effective, prescribers are advised to consult the package insert of any medication administered concomitantly with hormonal contraceptives, since some medications may decrease the effectiveness of these birth control products.

Patients should be prospectively cautioned not to self-medicate with the herbal supplement St. John's Wort. A possible interaction has been suggested with hormonal contraceptives based on reports of breakthrough bleeding with oral contraceptives shortly after starting St. John's Wort. Pregnancies have been reported by users of combined hormonal contraceptives who also used some form of St. John's Wort.

If a pregnancy occurs during isotretinoin treatment, isotretinoin must be discontinued immediately. The patient should be referred to an obstetrician-gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Any suspected fetal exposure during or one month after isotretinoin therapy must be reported immediately to the FDA via the MedWatch number 1–800-FDA-1088 and also to the iPLEDGE Pregnancy Registry at 1–866–495–0654 or via the internet (www.ipledgeprogram.com).

Isotretinoin is contraindicated in patients who are pregnant.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: Considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^111GT4ZK]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

When considering benzodiazepine use disorder in pregnant patients, the 2025 guidelines from AAFP, AAN, AANP, AAPA, AAPP, ACMT, ACOG, AGS, APA, and ASAM recommend weighing the risks and benefits for the maternal-fetal dyad. It is crucial to assess whether to continue prescribing or taper benzodiazepines in these specific circumstances.

### Zenatane [^115gcYpz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Using two forms of contraception simultaneously substantially reduces the chances that a patient will become pregnant compared to the risk with either form alone.

### Comparison of contraceptive failures associated with CYP3A4-inducing drug-drug interactions by route of hormonal contraceptive in an adverse event reporting system [^115RTd2S]. Contraception (2021). Low credibility.

To estimate associations between contraceptive failures and concomitant CYP3A4-inducing medications by route of administration, the study design involved a comparison of unintended pregnancy outcomes within the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System. It examined the co-use of CYP3A4-inducing drugs and different routes of administration for levonorgestrel and etonogestrel/desogestrel.

Among 14,504 levonorgestrel case reports, the reporting odds ratio (ROR) was increased for oral (ROR = 4.2 [3.0–5.7]) and implant (ROR = 8.0 [5.8–11.0]) products, but not for intrauterine (ROR = 0.9 [0.6–1.3]) levonorgestrel products. For 9,348 etonogestrel/desogestrel case reports, oral and vaginal products were not associated with contraceptive failure. However, etonogestrel-containing implants (ROR = 4.9 [4.1–5.9]) were associated with increased contraceptive failure.

Levonorgestrel-containing combination oral products and implants containing levonorgestrel or etonogestrel were prone to CYP3A4-inducing drug-drug interactions that may increase contraceptive failures. The progestin components of hormonal contraceptives are susceptible to drug-drug interactions, but this susceptibility is influenced by the route of administration. This study provides evidence from an Adverse Event Reporting System that CYP3A4-inducing medications increase the risk of unintended pregnancy for oral and implant contraceptives, but not for intrauterine or vaginal devices.

### Use of hormonal contraceptives and antidepressants and risks of suicidal behavior and accidents among women with premenstrual disorders: a nationwide cohort study [^116XjXQd]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Premenstrual disorders (PMDs) are characterized by a range of psychological and physical symptoms that manifest 1–2 weeks before menstruation and significantly resolve after menstruation begins. PMDs primarily encompass premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD); the latter is characterized by more severe affective symptoms and functional impairment. The prevalence is reported to be 20–40% for PMS and 2–8% for PMDD. The chronicity and cyclicity of premenstrual symptoms may impose substantial functional impairment among affected women; for PMDD, it is suggested to be comparable to that of major depression. Emerging evidence indicates that PMDs may also have a long-lasting impact on major health outcomes. A recent study from our group showed that, compared to women without PMDs, women with PMDs have a more than doubled risk of suicidal behavior and a more than 30% increased risk of accidents. This highlights the importance of preventing such devastating consequences with clinical management.

Hormonal contraceptives and antidepressants are recommended as first-line treatments for PMDs. However, 10–40% of PMDs do not respond to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or combined oral contraceptives (COCs) containing drospirenone. Even for patients who respond to these treatments, impairments in interpersonal relationships may still predispose these women to increased risks of suicidal behavior and accidents. Moreover, PMDs are highly comorbid with depression and anxiety, which are strong predictors of suicidal behavior.

### Slynd [^1158PyyU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes (for example, CYP3A4) may decrease the effectiveness of Slynd or increase breakthrough bleeding. Counsel patients to use a backup or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with Slynd.

- **Effects of other drugs on hormonal contraceptives**: Substances decreasing the systemic concentrations of hormonal contraceptives (HCs) and potentially diminishing the efficacy of HCs include drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, such as cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). This induction may decrease the systemic concentrations of HCs and potentially diminish their effectiveness or increase breakthrough bleeding.

	- Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of HCs include efavirenz, phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant, and products containing St. John's wort.

	- Interactions between HCs and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. It is advised to counsel females to use an alternative non-hormonal method of contraception or a backup method when enzyme inducers are used with HCs. They should continue using backup non-hormonal contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability.

### Systemic hormonal contraception initiation after abortion: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117WGKbq]. Contraception (2021). Low credibility.

When assessing the two studies that compared systemic hormonal contraception initiation to non-hormonal contraception following medication abortion, there was limited evidence to draw conclusions. Results were inconsistent; one study reported slightly fewer women with abortion success in the COC group, but differences were not statistically significant and event rates were very low. A pooled analysis of the two trials was similarly imprecise, with broad confidence intervals around the estimated effect. Larger studies are required to evaluate whether there is no difference in success rates with COC initiation.

The safety concern with initiating hormonal contraception after abortion revolves around theoretical concerns of an increased risk of thromboembolism after pregnancy and with combined hormonal contraception use. We did not identify any data that addressed this outcome. In addition, no safety concerns were identified in terms of bleeding following systemic hormonal contraception initiation after medical or surgical abortion. In terms of method discontinuation, bleeding was a main reason for implant removal in immediate and delayed groups at three- and six-month follow-up, which is consistent with other studies that found bleeding changes were a main reason for implant discontinuation.

### Clinical management of withdrawal from benzodiazepine anxiolytic and hypnotic medications [^113sQXWT]. Addiction (2022). High credibility.

Benzodiazepines continue to be prescribed widely in the management of patients with insomnia or anxiety disorders, despite the availability and acceptability of alternative pharmacological and psychological treatments. Many patients experience adverse effects during treatment and considerable distress when the dosage is reduced and stopped.

Management of benzodiazepine withdrawal includes measures to prevent the development of dependence, careful attention to underlying medical conditions, medication consolidation and gradual dosage reduction, accompanying psychological interventions, occasional prescription of concomitant medication, and relapse prevention with ongoing support to address psychosocial stressors.

There is a need for easier patient access to services with refined expertise and for further research to optimize strategies for preventing dependence and facilitating withdrawal.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: Considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^115TMzrf]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for benzodiazepine use disorder, with specific attention to adjunctive therapy, the AAFP/AAN/AANP/AAPA/AAPP/ACMT/ACOG/AGS/APA/ASAM 2025 guidelines recommend offering behavioral interventions to patients undergoing benzodiazepine tapering. These interventions should be tailored to the patient's underlying conditions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or CBT for insomnia (CBT-I), or provide referrals to access these interventions.

### Science-based approach to harmonize contraception recommendations in clinical trials and pharmaceutical labels [^115SebdW]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). High credibility.

For clinical studies not discussed in the four categories above, pregnancy tests are not typically required more than once per month during study treatment unless there is a specific pregnancy safety concern for the pharmaceutical. If protocol-scheduled visits are more than one month apart, testing is conducted at scheduled visits. If scheduled visits occur infrequently, additional tests may be needed between visits. Additional tests may also be conducted between visits if the subject or investigator suspects pregnancy or prior to a protocol-required procedure that would increase the risk to a pregnant subject.

A pregnancy test should be repeated before pharmaceutical re-administration when the administration of the pharmaceutical is disrupted for more than seven days and there was also a lapse in contraceptive use. This applies regardless of the reason for the disruption, such as a temporary discontinuation of study treatment for an adverse experience or if required by the study design, like during a washout period before the second arm of a crossover study.

After completion of pharmaceutical dosing, pregnancy testing should continue, at a minimum, until plasma levels of the pharmaceutical fall to clinically insignificant levels, which is after at least five terminal phase half-lives, and any pharmacologic or toxicologic effects relevant to the risk of fetal harm have diminished.

Pregnancy testing without contraception may suffice in cases of drugs with very short exposure times, such as imaging agents like contrast media, and/or if study participants remain in-house, for example, in a phase I unit.

### Guidelines for perioperative care in elective colorectal surgery: Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Society recommendations: 2018 [^115Wkrzb]. World Journal of Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Regarding perioperative care for colorectal surgery, more specifically with respect to preoperative anxiolytic premedication, the ERAS 2019 guidelines recommend considering the use of opioid-sparing multimodal re-anesthetic medication. This involves a combination of acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and gabapentinoids, adjusted according to age and renal function. It is important to limit gabapentinoids to a single lowest dose to avoid sedative side effects.

### Accutane [^113PGVCY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Using two forms of contraception simultaneously substantially reduces the chances of a patient becoming pregnant compared to using either form alone. A drug interaction that decreases the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives has not been entirely ruled out for Accutane (see precautions: drug interactions). Although hormonal contraceptives are highly effective, prescribers are advised to consult the package insert of any medication administered concomitantly with hormonal contraceptives, since some medications may decrease the effectiveness of these birth control products.

Patients should be prospectively cautioned not to self-medicate with the herbal supplement St. John's Wort, as a possible interaction with hormonal contraceptives has been suggested based on reports of breakthrough bleeding on oral contraceptives shortly after starting St. John's Wort. Pregnancies have been reported by users of combined hormonal contraceptives who also used some form of St. John's Wort.

If a pregnancy does occur during isotretinoin treatment, isotretinoin must be discontinued immediately. The patient should be referred to an obstetrician-gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling.

### Reproductive biology and psychotropic treatments in premenopausal women with bipolar disorder [^112EedbD]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Treating women with bipolar disorder during the reproductive years requires special consideration because of the reproductive risks associated with specific psychotropic drugs and drug interactions with hormonal contraceptives. Some psychotropic drugs can disrupt the menstrual cycle, alter pregnancy potential, and increase the risk for chronic conditions associated with hormone changes, such as prolactin elevation and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Valproate has been associated with an increased risk of PCOS features. Typical antipsychotics and risperidone can increase prolactin production, which may also disrupt the menstrual cycle. When the menstrual cycle is altered, fertility is reduced, and medical conditions such as osteoporosis and endometrial hyperplasia can result. This article advises establishing the regularity of menstrual cycles and discussing the potential reproductive impact of specific psychotropic medications before initiating treatment in women with bipolar disorder who are of reproductive age.

### Effectiveness of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics in treatment of adult insomnia: meta-analysis of data submitted to the Food and Drug Administration [^113cWWpu]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

The response to a medical treatment consists of two components: a true drug effect and a non-specific placebo response, which includes the placebo effect, regression toward the mean, and improvement because of the natural course of the condition. For that reason, it is useful, both for clinical practice and for future treatment development, to know the effect sizes for the placebo group as well as for the control group. For example, finding that both placebos and drugs are effective, but that the drug is more effective than the placebo, suggests that placebo characteristics can be used to amplify the effectiveness of a drug. Conversely, finding improvement only in drug arms indicates that the placebo effect is not an important component of treatment. In contrast, finding that both are equally effective, compared with waiting list controls, suggests that non-specific aspects of patient care might be having positive effects.

We found that both the drug effect and the placebo response were small and of questionable clinical importance. The two put together, however, lead to a reasonably large clinical response. Although the drug-placebo difference in objectively measured sleep latency was only 22 minutes, the response to the Z drugs, including both drug effect and placebo effect components, was 42 minutes. Similarly, the effect size for the drug response was −0.93 and that for the placebo response was −0.39, accounting for about half of the drug response.

Insomnia is a symptom-defined disorder characterized by distress about perceived poor sleep.

### Effect of time-dependent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants during pregnancy on behavioral, emotional, and social development in preschool-aged children [^116w48dp]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

In the context of depressive and anxiety disorders, women participating in MoBa Q1 and Q3 were provided with a list of previous and current illnesses, specifically mentioning depression, anxiety, or other mental disorders (hereafter referred to as depressive/anxiety disorders). To emulate the design and conceptualize a hypothetical randomized clinical trial using observational data, this study included pregnancies within women who reported depressive/anxiety disorders before and/or during pregnancy.

- **Severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms**: The severity of maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms was measured at two time points during pregnancy using the short versions of the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (SCL-25). Specifically, the 5-item (SCL-5) and 8-item (SCL-8) scales were utilized at weeks 17 and 30, respectively. These symptoms were also assessed postnatally at all follow-up points. More detailed information regarding the SCL is outlined in Supplement 1, available online.

- **SSRI exposure**: Information on SSRI exposure and the indication for use was gathered from Q1 (weeks 0−13+) and Q3 (weeks 13−29+). Women reported the name of the medication taken and the timing of use in 4-week intervals throughout pregnancy. Drug classification followed the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System. Exposure to SSRIs during pregnancy was defined as exposure to a drug within the ATC group N06AB. Conversely, exposure to non-SSRIs was defined as exposure to any other antidepressant within the ATC group N06A. Co-use of SSRIs and non-SSRIs was also documented.

To reflect the temporal sequence between the measurement of depressive symptoms and medication use, we defined the following…

### Treatment and management of mental health conditions during pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline No. 5 [^115TRVpk]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for generalized anxiety disorder, and more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, the ACOG 2023 guidelines recommend using a validated screening tool to monitor for response to treatment or remission of anxiety symptoms. It advises up-titrating medication dosage when clinically indicated with the goal of achieving remission of anxiety symptoms.

### Combined hormonal contraception use in reproductive-age women with contraindications to estrogen use [^113NeM76]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's US Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use recommends that combined hormonal contraceptives (i.e. birth control pills, contraceptive patch, vaginal ring) should be avoided in women with specific medical conditions because of the increased risk of cardiovascular events associated with estrogen use. Whether women with category 3 (theoretical or proven risk usually outweigh the advantages) or category 4 (unacceptable health risk) contraindications are appropriately avoiding estrogen-containing combined hormonal contraceptives is unknown.

- **Objective**: We describe the prevalence of combined hormonal contraceptive use among a sample of reproductive-age women with medical contraindications to estrogen use. Our hypothesis was that women with categories 3 and 4 contraindications would use estrogen-containing contraception less often than women without medical contraindications. We also explored whether inappropriate estrogen-containing contraceptive use is related to contraceptive provider characteristics.

- **Study design**: Data are from the baseline survey of the MyNewOptions study, which included privately insured women residing in Pennsylvania aged 18–40 years, who were sexually active and not intending pregnancy in the next year. Women were surveyed about their medical conditions, contraceptive use, and characteristics of their contraceptive provider. Women were considered to have a contraindication to combined hormonal contraceptives if they reported a category 3 or category 4 contraindication.

### Gestational exposure to benzodiazepines, 1: The risk of spontaneous abortion examined through the prism of research design [^114rbseX]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

A recent large case-control study found that, after adjusting for measured confounds, early gestational exposure to benzodiazepines was associated with nearly doubled odds of spontaneous abortion. The risks differed little between pregnancies exposed to short- and long-acting benzodiazepines, and they were elevated for all benzodiazepines for which data were adequate for analysis. The risks were higher with higher daily doses, indicating that early gestational exposure to benzodiazepines is a marker for the risk of spontaneous abortion. However, these findings do not provide evidence for a cause-effect relationship because analyses in such studies can adjust only for measured confounds. Unmeasured, inadequately measured, and unknown confounds will continue to contaminate the interpretation of findings.

Thus, replication of the study with the same study design using data extracted from other databases will serve no purpose. **Innovative research designs**: Should be considered, such as the examination of risk associated with benzodiazepine exposure in the year before pregnancy, examination of risk in previously unexposed pregnancies, examination of risk in discordant sibling pairs, and examination of risk associated with paternal exposure. Such research designs have the potential to indirectly, partially address unmeasured and unknown confounds, including those related to genetics and the family environment.

### Comparison of contraceptive failures associated with CYP3A4-inducing drug-drug interactions by route of hormonal contraceptive in an adverse event reporting system [^112Pyyuv]. Contraception (2021). High credibility.

These results indicate a differential association between the use of CYP3A4-inducing medications and unintended pregnancies among hormonal contraceptive users, dependent on the route of administration. Oral and implant contraceptive products were susceptible to these drug-drug interactions, but neither intrauterine nor vaginal ring products were affected. These findings are clinically important as both intrauterine and implant devices are long-acting and reversible options with much lower failure rates with typical use compared to oral contraception. However, our results suggest that in the presence of metabolic inducers that increase the clearance of hormonal agents, intrauterine or vaginal devices may be preferred.

The finding that the levonorgestrel implant had a higher reporting odds ratio (ROR) compared to oral products is noteworthy. Although implants typically have favorable failure rates, they have lower systemic exposure compared to oral contraceptives, which explains the observed susceptibility. Mean blood levels of levonorgestrel with implants range from 300 to 400 ng/L, with declining exposure over time, while oral products have mean concentrations between 1370 and 2050 ng/L. Similar effects have been observed with the newer generation etonogestrel-containing implant, which also demonstrated a significant signal for contraceptive failure in this study.

Antiepileptics, especially topiramate, constituted the majority of CYP3A4 inducers in this study and may be most relevant in developed nations, whereas antiretrovirals and rifamycin antibiotics may be more relevant in low-resource countries. Awareness of these interactions is necessary to optimize contraceptive efficacy.

### Use of hormonal contraceptives and antidepressants and risks of suicidal behavior and accidents among women with premenstrual disorders: A nationwide cohort study [^1151r9z7]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Our findings suggest that the use of hormonal contraceptives may be associated with a lower risk of suicidal behavior among women with premenstrual disorders (PMDs), particularly for combined products. If confirmed in future clinical trials, the use of combined contraceptives may help mitigate the risk of suicidal behaviors among women with PMDs.

### Prescribing antidepressants and anxiolytic medications to pregnant women: Comparing perception of risk of foetal teratogenicity between Australian obstetricians and gynaecologists, speciality trainees and upskilled general practitioners [^112t1S6h]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Low credibility.

Both groups, in practice, recommended maintaining close doctor-patient relationships to nurture clear communication and support during pregnancy, avoiding the ill-advised cessation of antidepressants (AD) or anxiolytics (AX) upon pregnancy or during lactation. Both groups perceived women's fears about foetal malformation when the use of AD or AX during pregnancy was mentioned. It is concerning that 9.4% to 22.3% of clinicians incorrectly labeled commonly used AD or AX medications as causing teratogenicity, highlighting the need for ready access to updated, evidence-based sources of medication advice for clinicians.

Provision of written information has strong evidence supporting benefits for patient decision-making, especially in a population group where anxiety or lack of concentration may cause impairment. Our study shows that this resource is infrequently used (approximately 10%). There was no universal source for patient and clinician-friendly information, likely reflecting the difficulty of finding robust evidence regarding medication use in pregnancy, a consequence of ethical restraints on trialing medications in pregnant women. The onus remains on clinicians to update themselves with the latest available data.

The participants who responded to the survey admitted only a modest interest in mental health disorders during pregnancy. They also admitted to not being actively involved in research, nor had their knowledge of treatments been frequently challenged by new data at conferences or in journal articles. Additionally, they were infrequently involved in passing on that knowledge.

### Contraception and mental health: A commentary on the evidence and principles for practice [^111qrNfT]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Among the most prevalent and disabling chronic diseases affecting reproductive-aged women worldwide, depression and anxiety can contribute to adverse reproductive health outcomes, including an increased risk of unintended pregnancy and its health and social consequences. For women with these common mental health conditions who want to avoid an unintended pregnancy, effective contraception can be an important strategy to maintain and even improve health and well-being. Reproductive health clinicians play a critical role in providing and managing contraception to help women with mental health considerations achieve their desired fertility.

In this commentary, we review the literature on relationships between mental health and contraception and describe considerations for the clinical management of contraception among women with depression and anxiety. We discuss issues related to contraceptive method effectiveness and adherence concerns, mental health-specific contraceptive method safety and drug interaction considerations, and clinical counseling and management strategies. Given important gaps in scientific knowledge of mental health and contraception, we highlight areas for future research.

### Paroxetine [^1158n2Hp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Paroxetine capsules are indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms (VMS) associated with menopause.

- **Limitation of use**: Paroxetine capsules are not indicated for the treatment of any psychiatric condition. They contain a lower dose of paroxetine compared to that used to treat depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The safety and efficacy of this lower dose have not been established for any psychiatric condition. Patients who require paroxetine for the treatment of a psychiatric condition should discontinue paroxetine capsules and initiate a paroxetine-containing medication that is indicated for such use.

Paroxetine capsules are a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) specifically indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause.

### Use of hormonal contraceptives and antidepressants and risks of suicidal behavior and accidents among women with premenstrual disorders: a nationwide cohort study [^114jf4Ea]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

- **Effect modification by psychiatric comorbidities**: The lower risk of suicidal behavior with the use of contraceptives was noted among PMDs patients with or without psychiatric comorbidities in the within-individual analysis (p for interaction 0.043), although a lack of statistical significance was observed in the between-individual analysis (p for interaction 0.830). The higher risk of suicidal behavior when using antidepressants was evident regardless of psychiatric comorbidities, although the magnitude was greater among women without psychiatric comorbidities (p for interaction 0.048 and 0.030 in between- and within-individual analyses).

- **Associations of use of hormonal contraceptives and antidepressants**: a Use of hormonal contraceptives and antidepressants were mutually adjusted for, and the analysis was accounted for non-independence of follow-ups contributed by the same individual using a robust sandwich estimator of variance. Estimates were also adjusted for age at follow-up, educational level (primary school, high school, or college and beyond), country of birth (Sweden or other), region of residency (south, middle, or north of Sweden), and psychiatric comorbidities (yes or no).

	b. Use of hormonal contraceptives and antidepressants were mutually adjusted for, and the analysis was conditioned on each individual.

### Combined oral anticonceptives and the pill-free week in two bipolar patients treated with lamotrigine [^113t45dm]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

- **Background**: Lamotrigine (LTG) is a level 1 treatment option for bipolar disorder, effective in both treatment and prophylaxis of depressive symptoms. It is generally safe and well tolerated, though there is a rare but serious side effect of Stevens-Johnson syndrome. This risk occurs when dose titration is too rapid; hence, a titration phase of 5–6 weeks is recommended. Since valproic acid is no longer recommended as a first-line mood stabilizer in fertile women, LTG is often used in these patients. For birth control, these women frequently use combined oral anticonceptives (COC) containing ethinyl estradiol and progestins. However, estrogens interact with LTG, potentially lowering plasma concentration by up to 60%. Estrogen-induced glucuronidation is responsible for the drop in lamotrigine levels during active COC use. This drug interaction is well documented and also occurs with other ethinyl estradiol-containing anticonceptives (e.g. vaginal ring), hormonal replacement therapy, and during pregnancy.

For use as an anticonvulsant in epilepsy, guidelines recommend using a different contraceptive strategy or skipping the pill-free week. Often, women do not prefer to continuously skip the pill-free week, as this can lead to more breakthrough bleeding and spotting. When used as a mood stabilizer, it is unclear what effect a pill-free week (and thus variable LTG concentrations) may have on mood symptoms. Some evidence exists for a plasma concentration-response association, with a therapeutic range between 1–6 µg/mL. The evidence for a clinically relevant therapeutic window is sparse.

### Comparative effectiveness of interventions to facilitate deprescription of benzodiazepines and other sedative hypnotics: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^111gE7BG]. BMJ (2025). High credibility.

We developed a protocol for this systematic review and meta-analysis, which was reviewed and approved by the BE SAFE collaborators in February 2023 and registered online on Open Science Framework. We report our study according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist.

- **Eligibility criteria**: Eligible studies randomized adult patients using BSH for insomnia to interventions aimed at deprescribing or discontinuation of BSH, strategies to implement these interventions, or standard care or placebo. Examples of eligible interventions include, but are not limited to, supervised tapering with or without drug support, education of patients about the harms of BSH, education of healthcare providers, behavioral interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy, and system-level interventions such as implementing new protocols or services in healthcare facilities. BSH drugs include, but are not limited to, benzodiazepines (for example, diazepam, alprazolam) and non-benzodiazepine "z-drugs" (for example, zolpidem, zaleplon). We did not restrict eligibility on the basis of the duration of BSH use.

We anticipated that some trials would recruit patients who used BSH for a mix of different conditions and that some trials might not report the primary reason for which patients were using BSH. We included such trials unless explicit evidence showed that 60% or more of patients were using BSH for conditions other than insomnia. However, we did subgroup analyses investigating differences in results between trials in which patients were expl.

### Acog practice bulletin. The use of hormonal contraception in women with coexisting medical conditions. Number 18, July 2000 [^113cg5f3]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2001). Low credibility.

Although numerous studies have addressed the safety and effectiveness of hormonal contraceptive use in healthy women, data are far less complete for women with underlying medical problems or other special circumstances. Because recommendations vary widely, substantial confusion exists with respect to contraceptive guidelines for women with coexisting medical conditions or other concerns. Using available scientific evidence, this practice bulletin will provide information to facilitate contraceptive counseling and selection for women with coexisting medical conditions.

### Antiepileptic drugs and hormonal contraceptives in adolescent women with epilepsy [^113i4bP6]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Both estrogen and progesterone influence seizure activity in women with epilepsy, with estrogen generally demonstrating proconvulsant and progesterone anticonvulsant effects. Women with epilepsy exhibit a variety of endocrine disturbances, probably due to a combination of factors, including the epilepsy syndrome and the effect of interictal and ictal epileptic discharges in the brain. The direct effects of some antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) further increase this risk, apparently related to a specific drug's effect on hepatic microsomal enzymes of the cytochrome P-450 system.

AEDs that induce hepatic microsomal enzymes also interact with hormonal contraception to increase estrogen's metabolism and progesterone's protein binding, decreasing concentrations of both hormones and thus reducing contraceptive efficacy. Some evidence indicates that the use of hormonal contraceptives and lamotrigine significantly decreases the plasma concentration of lamotrigine, suggesting that close monitoring is warranted. Nevertheless, hormonal contraception confers comparable or superior efficacy compared with such other contraceptives as the intrauterine device and barrier methods and remains an appropriate option in women with epilepsy. Importantly, the use of hormonal contraception and AEDs does not adversely affect seizure control.

Careful patient management, including the use of increased estrogen doses (≥ 50 micrograms) in patients receiving enzyme-inducing AEDs, may further minimize the risk for unintended pregnancy. Special considerations in women of childbearing age include…

### Lorazepam [^111qar4x]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Lorazepam-oral contraceptive steroids interaction**: Coadministration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with oral contraceptive steroids (norethindrone acetate, 1 mg, and ethinyl estradiol, 50 μg, for at least 6 months) to healthy females (n = 7) was associated with a 55% decrease in half-life and a 50% increase in the volume of distribution. This resulted in an almost 3.7-fold increase in total clearance of lorazepam as compared with control healthy females (n = 8). It may be necessary to increase the dose of lorazepam in female patients who are concomitantly taking oral contraceptives (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

- **Lorazepam-probenecid interaction**: Coadministration of lorazepam (2 mg intravenously) with probenecid (500 mg orally every 6 hours) to 9 healthy volunteers resulted in a prolongation of lorazepam half-life by 130% and a decrease in its total clearance by 45%. No change in the volume of distribution was noted during probenecid co-treatment. Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by 50% when coadministered with probenecid (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

- **Drug/laboratory test interactions**: No laboratory test abnormalities were identified when lorazepam was given alone or concomitantly with another drug, such as narcotic analgesics, inhalation anesthetics, scopolamine, atropine, and a variety of tranquilizing agents.

- **Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility**: No evidence of carcinogenic potential emerged in rats and mice during an 18-month study with oral lorazepam. No studies regarding mutagenesis have been performed.

### Managing adverse effects of hormonal contraceptives [^116GwfYJ]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Adverse effects of hormonal contraceptives usually diminish with continued use of the same method. Often, physicians only need to reassure patients that these symptoms will likely resolve within three to five months. Long-acting injectable depot medroxyprogesterone acetate is the only hormonal contraceptive consistently associated with weight gain; other hormonal methods are unlikely to increase weight independent of lifestyle choices.

Switching combined oral contraceptives is not effective in treating headaches, nor is the use of multivitamins or diuretics. There are no significant differences among various combined oral contraceptives in terms of breast tenderness, mood changes, and nausea. Breakthrough bleeding is common in the first months of combined oral contraceptive use. If significant abnormal bleeding persists beyond three months, other methods can be considered, and the patient may need to be evaluated for other causes.

Studies of adverse sexual effects in women using hormonal contraceptives are inconsistent, and the pharmacologic basis for these symptoms is unclear. If acne develops or worsens with progestin-only contraceptives, the patient should be switched to a combination method if she is medically eligible. There is insufficient evidence of any effect of hormonal contraceptives on breast milk quantity and quality. Patient education should be encouraged to decrease the chance of unanticipated adverse effects. Women can also be assessed for medical eligibility before and during the use of hormonal contraceptives.

### Anxiolytics: past, present, and future agents [^116otiCt]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Although anxiety disorders were classified as neurotic disorders and not systematically studied before DSM-III, researchers and clinicians have been searching for effective, safe agents to treat anxiety symptoms and disorders for over a century. During this period, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and many classes of antidepressants have been used as anxiolytics. However, all of these classes have side effect profiles that made them less than optimal treatments for anxiety.

The recognition of the role of GABA in anxiety disorders has led researchers to develop anxiolytics that specifically target GABA. The long-sought-after class of anxiolytics that are both effective and safe may be found in the new research being conducted with agents that selectively target GABA receptors and their subtypes.

### Use of hormonal contraceptives and antidepressants and risks of suicidal behavior and accidents among women with premenstrual disorders: A nationwide cohort study [^113iZC7g]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Over 70% of patients with premenstrual disorders (PMDs) experience symptom onset during adolescence; yet, it often takes years and multiple healthcare visits to receive a diagnosis, which typically occurs in their 30s. We followed all women from July 1, 2005, or their 15th birthday (as 96% of Swedish women had reached menarche by age 15), whichever occurred last, until death, emigration, bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy, July 31, 2011, or their 52nd birthday (the mean age of menopause among Swedish women), whichever came first. This was achieved through cross-linkage to the Causes of Death and the Migration Registers. We excluded 338 women who had undergone bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy (n = 197), emigrated permanently (n = 134), or died (n = 7) before cohort entry, leaving 23,029 PMD patients for analysis.

- **Use of antidepressants and hormonal contraceptives**: All prescriptions for antidepressants (N06AB, N06AX, N06AA) and hormonal contraceptives for systemic use (G03A except G03AD for emergency contraceptives) were identified from the Prescribed Drug Register, regardless of the actual indication for the prescription. For instance, antidepressants may be prescribed for depression, while hormonal contraceptives might be used for contraception purposes. Prescriptions that were returned to pharmacies after dispensation were excluded. The duration of dispensed medication was estimated using the prescribed total amount and the estimated daily dosage. The Defined Daily Dose was used as the daily dosage for contraceptives. For antidepressants, a newly developed algorithm that uses machine learning was applied to predict the clinician's prescription patterns.

### Sexual side effects of pharmacological treatment of psychiatric diseases [^117XEvBg]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Since the introduction of psychiatric medications with relatively good safety profiles, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, increasing attention has been given to side effects such as sexual dysfunction (SD). Although unrelated to risks of mortality, SD could undermine compliance with treatment regimens and impair quality of life. Indeed, there is consistent evidence to suggest that a large number of psychiatric medications adversely affect one or more of the three phases of normal sexual response: desire, arousal, and orgasm.

### Unanticipated consequences of switching to sugammadex: Anesthesia provider survey on the hormone contraceptive drug interaction [^1111ZfRb]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Low credibility.

Sugammadex binds progesterone with high affinity and may interfere with hormonal contraceptive effectiveness. The clinical, economic, and ethical implications of unintended pregnancy should prompt anesthesiologists to actively consider and manage this pharmacologic interaction. We surveyed anesthesiology providers at our institution about their knowledge of this potential adverse drug interaction, how they manage it clinically, and the extent to which they involve patients in shared decision-making regarding the choice of neuromuscular blocker antagonist.

- **Methods**: A survey instrument was distributed to anesthesiology providers at a large, tertiary-care medical center. The survey explored prior experience using neostigmine and sugammadex, knowledge about potential sugammadex interference with hormonal contraception, pre-/postoperative counseling practices, clinical management, and shared decision-making regarding the potential use of neostigmine in lieu of sugammadex to avoid this drug-drug interaction.

- **Results**: Of 259 surveys distributed, 155 were fully completed and 10 were partially completed. Overall response rate was 60% (residents 85%, student nurse anesthetists 53%, certified registered nurse anesthetists 58%, attendings 48%). All but one respondent recognized the potential for sugammadex interference with oral hormonal contraception. Far fewer accurately identified potential interference with hormonal intrauterine devices (44%) and hormonal contraceptive implants (55%). The manufacturer's recommended 7-day duration of alternative contraception was correctly identified by most participants.

### Pharmacologic factors associated with transient neonatal symptoms following prenatal psychotropic medication exposure [^11673yF8]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants (SSRIs) and benzodiazepines are frequently used to treat maternal depression and anxiety disorders during pregnancy. Recent reports suggest that prenatal SSRI exposure is associated with a neonatal discontinuation syndrome. It remains unclear whether these symptoms are directly related to SSRI exposure alone or are due to pharmacologic factors. This study explores relationships between neonatal outcomes and medication levels during pregnancy, at delivery, and in the newborn period.

- **Method**: This study sought to compare newborn behavior following second and third trimester exposure to either single-agent SSRIs (group 1) or SSRIs combined with clonazepam (group 2). A prospective cohort of mothers and their infants (N = 46) who had received SSRI medication alone or in combination with clonazepam were studied from June 1996 through June 2000 and compared with a nonexposed control group (N = 23). Infants were assessed in the newborn period for signs suggestive of a "discontinuation syndrome". Maternal drug levels were measured during the pregnancy and at delivery. Infant drug levels from cord blood and at day 2 of life were also obtained.

- **Results**: Overall, 30% of the exposed infants (groups 1 and 2, N = 14) showed symptoms of transient poor neonatal adaptation compared with 9% (N = 2) of control infants. In group 1, 25% had symptoms (fluoxetine N = 3; paroxetine N = 3; sertraline N = 1) and in group 2, 39% of infants had symptoms (paroxetine with clonazepam, N = 7). Symptoms were typically mild.

### Effects of hormonal contraceptives on mood: A focus on emotion recognition and reactivity, reward processing, and stress response [^111ytJnn]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Comparison of ovarian hormone profiles across the natural menstrual cycle (top row) and during the intake of most common hormonal contraceptives, such as combined hormonal contraception (middle row) and progestin-only hormonal contraception (bottom row), is provided. The modes of action, as well as intake characteristics of the most common hormonal contraceptives, are described below.

Relying on Danish Registry data, Skovlund and colleagues recently reported a link between antidepressant prescription and hormonal contraceptive (HC) use. The authors included data from more than one million women aged 15–34 years, who were using combined estradiol/progestin as well as progestin-only HCs in all available forms of administration (see Fig. 1). In these women, risk ratios for first diagnoses of depression or first antidepressant use increased during the first 6 months after initiation of HC use, showing a 1.8-fold relative risk compared with naturally cycling women. Similarly, Zettermark and colleagues investigated the prescription of psychotropic drugs (anxiolytics, hypnotics, sedatives, or antidepressants) within the first year of HC use in a sample of 800,000 women from a Swedish health registry. Reported rates for psychotropic drug use indicated an adjusted odds ratio of 1.34 for a first-time psychotropic drug prescription in HC users. However, both studies were correlational in nature, and reporting relative risks can be misleading as the incidence of these events is quite low. While causation is not determinable in observational designs, both studies highlight important associations.

### Anesthesia providers' knowledge of medication interference with hormonal contraception: A multisite survey [^111WjeoW]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). Low credibility.

Sugammadex, aprepitant, and fosaprepitant are increasingly used perioperatively. These medications may interfere with the effectiveness of hormonal contraception. This study assessed anesthesia providers' use of sugammadex and aprepitant, their knowledge of interactions with hormonal birth control, and patient counseling practices to identify possible knowledge gaps or opportunities for practice improvement.

- **Methods**: In January 2023, an electronic survey was distributed to all anesthesia providers at Mayo Clinic sites, including Mayo Clinic Rochester, Mayo Clinic Arizona, Mayo Clinic Florida, and Mayo Clinic Health System hospitals. The survey included 32 questions assessing providers' use of sugammadex and aprepitant, their knowledge of the medications' interactions with hormonal contraceptives (HC), their perceptions regarding education of these interactions during training, and their perioperative patient counseling practices. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive statistics.

- **Results**: A total of 337 of 1092 (31%) providers completed the survey. While almost all respondents (324; 96%) knew that sugammadex may interfere with oral contraceptive effectiveness, only 158 (47%) knew about aprepitant's potential contraceptive interference. Only 176 providers (52%) knew the recommended duration for alternative contraceptive methods after use of sugammadex, and 119 providers (35%) knew the recommended duration after aprepitant exposure. Most respondents considered the interference of these perioperative drugs with HCs to be clinically relevant.

### Comparative effectiveness of interventions to facilitate deprescription of benzodiazepines and other sedative hypnotics: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^111SYifo]. BMJ (2025). High credibility.

We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. For each comparison and outcome, we rated the certainty of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low based on considerations of risk of bias (study limitations), inconsistency (heterogeneity in results across trials), indirectness (differences between the questions investigated in studies and the question of interest), imprecision (random error), and publication bias (the tendency for studies with statistically significant results or positive results to be published, published faster, or published in journals with higher visibility).

High certainty evidence suggests that the estimated effect, derived from a rigorous systematic review and meta-analysis, is likely to be close to the true effect. Conversely, low or very low certainty evidence suggests that the estimated effect may be substantially different from the true effect.

To make judgments about indirectness, we considered the context in which the trial was conducted. For non-drug interventions, we anticipated that evidence primarily comprised of trials conducted before 2000 would be indirect due to the potential for patients to react differently to behavioral interventions. For example, mailed educational materials may be less effective in the digital age, where physical mail is more quickly discarded. However, we did not encounter interventions and outcomes dominated by this issue.

An estimated 44% of all pregnancies worldwide are unintended, and half occur among users of contraceptive methods. Contraception is used by nearly 90% of women at risk for unintended pregnancy. It primarily consists of oral methods (68.8% of contraceptive users), 15% use long-acting intrauterine or implant devices, and 16.3% use other routes such as patches, rings, or injectables. Contraceptive failure rates vary considerably by administration routes, for example, 7% to 9% for oral products, and nearly or less than 1% for implant and intrauterine devices.

Growing evidence suggests a role for the concomitant use of other medications and potential drug-drug interactions with hormonal agents. The progestin component provides the major contraceptive effect; thus, drug-drug interactions mediated through cytochrome-P450 (CYP) 3A4 may be important. CYP3A4 drug-drug interaction warnings are part of the Food and Drug Administration's labeling guidance for all hormonal contraceptive products. The Centers for Disease Control & Prevention and World Health Organization provide recommendations for contraceptive products in the presence of drug interactions.

The objective of this study was to evaluate case reports of contraceptive failure (i.e. unintended pregnancy) among users of levonorgestrel-containing oral, intrauterine, and implant products, as well as etonogestrel-containing implants, vaginal rings, and oral (desogestrel pro-drug) products exposed to CYP3A4-inducing medications. It was hypothesized that due to lower systemic exposure, intrauterine and vaginal devices would not be impacted.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: Considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^112yvyC9]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for benzodiazepine use disorder, more specifically with respect to adjunctive therapy, AAFP/AAN/AANP/AAPA/AAPP/ACMT/ACOG/AGS/APA/ASAM 2025 guidelines recommend considering pausing or slowing the pace of the benzodiazepine taper when patients experience symptoms that significantly interfere with the taper, such as sleep difficulty or anxiety. Additionally, consider using adjunctive medications.

### Canadian guidelines on benzodiazepine receptor agonist use disorder among older adults [^1124NSMU]. Canadian Geriatrics Journal (2020). High credibility.

The CGS 2020 guidelines recommend considering the prescription of benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZRAs) for elderly patients only for the management of insomnia or anxiety. This is advised after failing adequate trials of nonpharmacological interventions or safer pharmacological alternatives. Additionally, BZRAs may be used for short-term bridging until more appropriate treatment becomes effective.

### Effect of hormonal emergency contraception on bleeding patterns [^112xQpxE]. Contraception (2004). Low credibility.

Spotting following the use of emergency contraception is not unusual, nor is anxiety in women waiting to see if the treatment has worked. It is not known whether such spotting should bring worry or relief. We, therefore, wished to see if there was any correlation between bleeding pattern and treatment outcome. Using data from a large multicenter efficacy trial, we examined bleeding patterns post-emergency contraception. The earlier in the cycle the pills were taken, the more likely the next bleed was to be early and the less likely it was to be on time. There was no observable difference in spotting rates between women who got pregnant and those who did not. The occurrence of spotting did not influence whether the next period was lighter or heavier.

### Gestational exposure to benzodiazepines, 2: The risk of congenital malformations examined through the prism of compatibility intervals [^1165b7Pv]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

A recent meta-analysis of the major malformation risk after gestational exposure to benzodiazepines identified eight prospective cohort studies with 5,195 exposed and 2,082,467 unexposed women. Benzodiazepine exposure was not associated with a statistically significant increase in the risk of total malformations (eight studies) or cardiac malformations (four studies). The malformation risk was not significantly increased after specifically first trimester exposure, either (five studies). However, there was a significant increase in risk associated with combined first trimester exposure to benzodiazepines and antidepressants (three studies). The authors of the meta-analysis interpreted their findings based on the conventional p-value framework. Importantly, the confidence interval (CI) for the first trimester exposure analysis was somewhat better distributed around the null (OR = 1.00), suggesting a lower likelihood of increased risk. All odds ratios (ORs) were very low to low in value, indicating a very small increase in absolute risk. Besides explaining how CIs may be interpreted as compatibility intervals, this article reminds readers that associations identified even in meta-analyses of cohort studies do not indicate a causal effect, because confounding by indication can never be ruled out.

### Prescribing and deprescribing guidance for benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine receptor agonist use in adults with depression, anxiety, and insomnia: An international scoping review [^113gi9Pz]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

Documents included in the study were defined or identified as either 'clinical practice guidelines' or 'clinical guidance documents' addressing the pharmacotherapy of anxiety disorders, insomnia, or unipolar depressive disorders in adults. Additionally, guidelines and guidance documents non-specific to any conditions but focused on BZD/BZRA-related issues, such as BZD use disorder or deprescribing/tapering, were included.

- **Clinical practice guideline**: Defined as "a collectively written document where recommendations are made, through a pre-specified evidence-based recommendation process, to an audience by a professional society, association, or group of affiliated experts on a topic relating to medical practice" [adapted from the Institute of Medicine definition].
- **Guidance document**: Originally defined as one "derived through a consultation process at a jurisdictional level to establish standards of care".

Discussions were held among screening reviewers about the differences between these types of documents to establish an informal consensus based on an understanding of these approximate definitions before the full-text screening stage. It was agreed that consensus articles, disease state algorithms, and other specific types of "review" articles could be eligible for inclusion if they avoided other exclusion criteria, as they offered important insights on expert opinion and guidance for BZD/BZRA use.

### Nextstellis [^115Fq5RZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: The presence of CYP3A inducers may lead to contraceptive failure and/or increase breakthrough bleeding. Avoid concomitant use. If concomitant use is unavoidable, use an alternative or back-up contraceptive method during co-administration and up to 28 days after discontinuation of the CYP3A inducer. Refer to the full prescribing information for additional clinically significant drug interactions.

- **Effects of other drugs on hormonal contraceptives**: Clinically significant drug interactions with other drugs affecting Nextstellis are detailed in the referencing material.

- **Effects of Nextstellis on other drugs**: Relevant interactions with Nextstellis that influence other drugs are presented in the associated documentation.

### Valtoco [^111qNVD8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: Elimination of diazepam could be decreased with coadministration of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 inhibitors; therefore, adverse reactions with Valtoco may be increased. Conversely, exposure of diazepam may be decreased with coadministration of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 inducers, thus reducing efficacy with Valtoco.

- **Effect of concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids**: The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression due to actions at different receptor sites in the CNS that control respiration. Benzodiazepines interact at GABA-A sites, while opioids primarily interact at mu receptors. When combined, there is a potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use, and monitor patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation.

- **CNS depressants and alcohol**: Coadministration of other CNS depressants (e.g. valproate) or alcohol consumption may potentiate the CNS-depressant effects of diazepam [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- **Effect of other drugs on Valtoco metabolism**: Potential interactions may occur when diazepam is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 activity. Inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g. cimetidine, quinidine, and tranylcypromine) and CYP3A4 (e.g. ketoconazole, troleandomycin, and clotrimazole) could decrease.

### Hormonal contraceptives and mood: Review of the literature and implications for future research [^115rAppx]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Low credibility.

We examine recent studies that investigate the effects of hormonal contraception on mood in different populations of women, including women in the general population and women with diagnosed psychiatric and gynecologic disorders. We address the mechanisms of several types of hormonal contraceptives and assess how these may affect mood and gynecologic disorders.

- **Recent findings**: The effects of hormonal contraceptives seem to be most relevant in selected subsets of women, as they may promote improved mental health in particular psychiatric disorders such as PMDD. Currently, there is no consistent evidence for negative effects of most hormonal contraceptives in the general population. Even though some studies reveal that certain individuals appear susceptible to negative mood effects from some forms of hormonal contraceptives, more research is needed to better identify these susceptible individuals.

### Prescribing and deprescribing guidance for benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine receptor agonist use in adults with depression, anxiety, and insomnia: an international scoping review [^116ySW36]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

Over thirty years of prescriptive guidance on BZD and BZRA from international clinician expert groups on anxiety disorders, unipolar depressive disorders, and insomnia demonstrate that these agents are still clearly not recommended as routine first-line agents or for longer-term use (i.e. beyond 4 weeks) in most patients. Recommendations on their use have not generally changed, but the lack of explicit direction on prescribing details, noted in many documents, can be further elaborated on in future iterations of guidelines.

A renewed focus on deprescribing of these agents within the past 10 years has elucidated areas of attention for research work to inform future guideline development panels. The shifting of deprescribing practices involving BZD from a clinical 'art' to a clinical 'science'-based practice should be a continued focus for guideline committees. Attention should be directed towards comparing dose reduction strategies, the use or non-use of diazepam (or other long-acting BZD), the use or non-use of adjunctive pharmacotherapies, and the value of 'micro' tapers using either compounded products or patient-directed alteration of available dosage forms.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^115HtvxH]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to benzodiazepines, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend educating patients taking benzodiazepines and their caregivers regarding the following:

- **The danger of drug-drug interactions**: Benzodiazepines can interact with other CNS depressants, leading to impairment and respiratory depression.

- **Risks associated with combining alcohol and benzodiazepines**: Emphasize the importance of abstaining from alcohol to avoid these risks.

- **Driving or heavy machinery usage**: Patients should be cautioned about the risks associated with driving or using heavy machinery during the first few days of benzodiazepine administration.

- **Drowsiness management**: Patients should be instructed to reduce the benzodiazepine dose if drowsiness occurs.

### Amnesteem [^112UFGDd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Using two forms of contraception simultaneously substantially reduces the chances of pregnancy compared to using either form alone. A drug interaction that decreases the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives has not been entirely ruled out for Amnesteem (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions). Although hormonal contraceptives are highly effective, prescribers are advised to consult the package insert of any medication administered concomitantly with hormonal contraceptives, as some medications may decrease their effectiveness.

Patients should be cautioned against self-medicating with the herbal supplement St. John's Wort, as it has been suggested to interact with hormonal contraceptives, leading to breakthrough bleeding. Pregnancies have been reported among users of combined hormonal contraceptives who also used St. John's Wort.

If a pregnancy occurs during Amnesteem treatment, it must be discontinued immediately. The patient should be referred to an obstetrician-gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for evaluation and counseling. Any suspected fetal exposure during or one month after Amnesteem therapy must be reported to the FDA via the MedWatch number 1–800-FDA-1088 and to the iPLEDGE Pregnancy Registry at 1–866–495–0654 or online at www.ipledgeprogram.com.

- **All patients**: Isotretinoin is contraindicated in patients who are pregnant.

### Comparative effectiveness of interventions to facilitate deprescription of benzodiazepines and other sedative hypnotics: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Ydbhr]. BMJ (2025). Low credibility.

To facilitate interpretation, we calculated the risk differences per 1000 patients for all dichotomous outcomes by multiplying the risk ratio obtained from meta-analyses with an estimate of the risk of the outcome in the control group. For the control group risk, we used the median risk reported in standard care groups across trials. The parallel BMJ Rapid Recommendations guideline panel provided input on the applicability of the control group risks.

We report results using GRADE simple language summaries: for example, describing high certainty evidence with declarative statements; moderate certainty evidence with "probably"; low certainty evidence with "may"; and very low certainty evidence with "very uncertain". In the main manuscript, for comparisons and outcomes with multiple measures of the same outcome, we prioritize reporting results from the measure with the highest certainty. If certainty ratings are comparable, we report results from the most commonly used measure.

- **Patient and public involvement**: The parallel BMJ Rapid Recommendations guideline panel, which included three patient partners, provided input on the scope of the systematic review, including the outcomes of interest.

### The use of hormonal contraception among women taking anticonvulsant therapy [^114vn4T7]. Contraception (2011). Low credibility.

Drug interactions between hormonal contraceptives and anticonvulsants, resulting in reduced contraceptive effectiveness and/or increased seizure activity, have been documented.

- **Study design**: We conducted a systematic review, searching PUBMED and The Cochrane Library for articles in any language on the use of hormonal contraceptive methods among women taking anticonvulsant therapy from 1966 through May 3, 2010. Forty-three articles were identified and evaluated.

- **Results**: Evidence suggests drug interactions occur when combined oral contraceptives (COCs), the levonorgestrel implant (Norplant), or the etonogestrel implant (Implanon) are used concomitantly with carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, topiramate, or lamotrigine. Significant drug interactions were not observed with sodium valproate intake and COC use, nor among women using progestogen-only contraceptives and taking lamotrigine.

- **Conclusions**: To avoid contraceptive failure or increased seizure activity, women with epilepsy should be offered contraceptive methods that do not interact with anticonvulsant medication.

### Pharmacological interventions for benzodiazepine discontinuation in chronic benzodiazepine users [^114njksx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

Prolonged treatment with benzodiazepines is common practice despite clinical recommendations for short-term use. Benzodiazepines are used by approximately 4% of the general population, with increased prevalence in psychiatric populations and the elderly. After long-term use, it is often difficult to discontinue benzodiazepines due to psychological and physiological dependence. This review investigated if pharmacological interventions can facilitate benzodiazepine tapering.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of pharmacological interventions to facilitate discontinuation of chronic benzodiazepine use.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following electronic databases up to October 2017: Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group's Specialised Register of Trials, CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and ISI Web of Science. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO ICTRP, and ISRCTN registry, and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials comparing pharmacological treatment versus placebo or no intervention, or versus another pharmacological intervention, in adults who had been treated with benzodiazepines for at least two months and/or fulfilled criteria for benzodiazepine dependence (any criteria).

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

- **Main results**: We included 38 trials (involving 2,543 participants), but we could only extract data from 35 trials with 2,295 participants. Many different interventions were evaluated.
