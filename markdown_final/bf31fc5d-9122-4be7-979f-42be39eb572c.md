## Question

Are patients with purely ocular myasthenia gravis at higher risk for complications under general anesthesia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether patients with purely ocular myasthenia gravis have a higher risk of complications under general anesthesia compared to patients without MG, and how to quantify and manage that risk. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of ocular MG and how it differs from generalized MG. Then, I should verify the specific anesthesia-related risks, especially around neuromuscular blockade and respiratory mechanics. Next, I will compare ocular MG with generalized MG and with non-MG populations to contextualize risk. After that, I need to check guideline-based perioperative management strategies that mitigate risk. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded conclusion and highlight key modifiers of risk and monitoring requirements.

> Let me first confirm the disease construct. Purely ocular MG is defined by weakness limited to the extraocular muscles and levator palpebrae, with normal strength in all other muscle groups, which distinguishes it from generalized MG that includes bulbar, limb, or respiratory involvement. Importantly, ocular MG still reflects an autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction with reduced functional acetylcholine receptors, even if symptoms are confined to the eyes.

> Now, I need to examine the core anesthesia-related risk: sensitivity to non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents. Wait, let me verify the comparative pharmacodynamics. A controlled study showed that patients with ocular MG required significantly higher doses of vecuronium to achieve the same degree of block than patients with generalized MG, suggesting relatively less sensitivity to non-depolarizers in ocular disease, though still greater than in non-MG patients; onset was also slower in ocular MG, reinforcing a graded but real vulnerability at the neuromuscular junction [^114zUBCh]. Hold on, I should also confirm the clinical implication: MG patients, including ocular forms, are broadly more sensitive to non-depolarizing agents and require dose reduction and careful titration with quantitative monitoring to avoid residual blockade and respiratory complications [^112cMoW4] [^1124eMLn].

> Next, I should review respiratory risk. Even in ocular MG, diaphragmatic and accessory respiratory muscles can be subclinically involved, and perioperative factors such as sedatives, volatile agents, opioids, and residual neuromuscular blockade can precipitate hypoventilation or airway compromise. The risk is lower than in generalized MG but not negligible, particularly if bulbar function is borderline or if deep blockade is allowed to persist [^114zBqrk] [^1124eMLn]. I should double-check the crisis framework: MGFA defines crisis as worsening weakness requiring ventilatory support, and while ocular MG patients are less likely to present in crisis, they are not immune to perioperative respiratory decompensation if mismanaged.

> Let me consider the comparative context. Compared with generalized MG, ocular MG has less pronounced sensitivity to non-depolarizers and a lower likelihood of preoperative bulbar or respiratory dysfunction, so the anesthetic risk is lower but still present. Compared with non-MG patients, ocular MG carries a clearly increased risk of prolonged or profound neuromuscular blockade and postoperative respiratory complications if standard MG precautions are not followed [^114zBqrk] [^1124eMLn]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought ocular MG might have near-normal NMBA responses, but that would be an overstatement; the correct interpretation is attenuated sensitivity relative to generalized MG, yet still pathologic compared with normal hosts, which mandates dose reduction and vigilant monitoring [^114zBqrk] [^1124eMLn].

> I will now examine guideline-based mitigation strategies. I need to ensure neuromuscular blockade is minimized or avoided when possible; if NMBAs are required, use reduced doses and titrate to train-of-four with quantitative monitoring, recognizing that eye muscle monitoring can be misleading due to faster recovery there than in respiratory muscles, so peripheral muscle monitoring is preferred for safety [^1125x9HA] [^116upXSR]. Hold on, I should verify reversal choices: sugammadex is favored over neostigmine for rocuronium or vecuronium because neostigmine may be less effective in patients on pyridostigmine, though sugammadex failures have been reported, so monitoring remains mandatory even with sugammadex [^112cMoW4] [^114qywHd]. Let me also confirm that pyridostigmine should generally be continued perioperatively to avoid withdrawal-related weakness, with the anesthesia team coordinating timing and dosing around the surgical plan [^115Nc3tC].

> Next, I should review preoperative optimization. I need to check that the patient is clinically stable, ideally in MGFA minimal manifestation status or better, before elective surgery; significant bulbar symptoms, respiratory compromise, or recent exacerbation increase risk and may warrant delaying surgery or providing short-term immunomodulation such as IVIG or plasma exchange in higher-risk scenarios, even though these are not routinely indicated for purely ocular disease without systemic features [^111sn1Aw] [^111B9ETw]. But wait, what if there is occult generalization or a thymoma? Screening for thymoma and assessing antibody status can refine risk and perioperative planning, and if thymectomy is planned, contemporary guidance supports proceeding when the patient is optimized medically to reduce perioperative morbidity [^112nKTFi] [^111aoKif].

> I should confirm medication and technique choices that reduce risk. Volatile agents potentiate neuromuscular blockade; therefore, favoring a total intravenous anesthesia approach with propofol and remifentanil, avoiding or minimizing volatile agents, and avoiding depolarizing agents such as succinylcholine when possible can reduce unpredictability; if intubation is needed without relaxants, consider deep inhalational induction or awake fiberoptic techniques in experienced hands [^113Teo76] [^112cMoW4]. Hold on, I should verify that beta-blockers can worsen MG weakness and blunt responses to anaphylaxis; if clinically safe, dose reduction or gradual withdrawal before elective surgery may be prudent, balancing cardiovascular indications against MG-related risks [^111JZfzY] [^112ZqjFh].

> Let me synthesize the risk profile. Yes, patients with purely ocular MG have a higher risk of anesthesia-related complications than patients without MG, primarily due to increased sensitivity to non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents and the potential for residual blockade leading to hypoventilation or airway issues. However, with careful preoperative optimization, avoidance or minimization of NMBAs, dose reduction with quantitative monitoring, appropriate reversal, and vigilant postoperative respiratory surveillance, this risk can be mitigated to a level that approaches non-MG patients in many elective settings [^114zBqrk] [^1124eMLn]. I should emphasize that the absolute risk is lower than in generalized MG but higher than in the general surgical population, which justifies MG-specific precautions even when symptoms are confined to the eyes [^114zBqrk].

> Finally, I need to ensure practical perioperative steps are explicit. Pre-op: confirm diagnosis and stability, screen for thymoma, review antibody profile, continue pyridostigmine, and coordinate with neurology. Intra-op: avoid NMBAs if possible, or use 30–50% reduced doses with quantitative TOF monitoring at a peripheral muscle, prefer sugammadex reversal when rocuronium or vecuronium are used, and avoid succinylcholine when feasible. Post-op: observe for delayed respiratory depression, use objective criteria for extubation, and resume outpatient MG therapy promptly with close follow-up for any delayed weakness or crisis signs [^1125x9HA] [^116upXSR] [^115Nc3tC]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about extubation readiness. Ensure quantitative recovery and clinical strength are adequate, because ocular muscle movement can normalize earlier than diaphragmatic function, creating a false sense of security if only eye movements are used to judge recovery [^116upXSR].

Patients with purely ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG) have a **lower risk of perioperative complications** under general anesthesia than those with generalized MG, but they still require **cautious anesthetic management** because of increased sensitivity to non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers and potential for respiratory compromise [^114zBqrk] [^1124eMLn]. Key risks include prolonged neuromuscular blockade, respiratory weakness, and postoperative myasthenic crisis, especially if bulbar or respiratory muscles are involved or if pyridostigmine is withheld preoperatively [^1124eMLn] [^114qywHd]. To mitigate risk, use **minimal or no neuromuscular blockade**, prefer sugammadex for reversal, and ensure quantitative neuromuscular monitoring; regional anesthesia is preferred when feasible [^116upXSR] [^112cMoW4]. Preoperative optimization and multidisciplinary planning are essential to reduce complications [^113NRHjj].

## Perioperative risks and complications

### Neuromuscular blockade and respiratory complications

- **Increased sensitivity to non-depolarizing muscle relaxants**: Patients with OMG exhibit heightened sensitivity to non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers (NMBs), such as vecuronium and rocuronium, necessitating dose reductions of 30–50% or avoidance when possible [^113Teo76] [^1124eMLn].

- **Prolonged neuromuscular blockade**: Delayed recovery from NMBs is common, increasing the risk of postoperative respiratory complications, including hypoventilation and respiratory failure [^1124eMLn].

- **Respiratory muscle weakness**: Although OMG primarily affects ocular muscles, respiratory muscles may be subclinically involved, increasing the risk of perioperative respiratory compromise [^notfound].

---

### Myasthenic crisis

Although less frequent than in generalized MG, **postoperative myasthenic crisis** can occur, particularly if preoperative management is suboptimal or if pyridostigmine is abruptly discontinued [^114qywHd] [^113QWtBi].

---

### Medication-related risks

- **Pyridostigmine withdrawal**: Discontinuation of pyridostigmine preoperatively can precipitate myasthenic crisis or exacerbate weakness, complicating anesthesia management [^1124eMLn].

- **Interaction with anesthetic agents**: Volatile anesthetics and opioids can potentiate neuromuscular blockade and respiratory depression, necessitating careful titration and monitoring [^113Teo76].

---

## Anesthetic management strategies

### Preoperative preparation

Preoperative preparation should include a **multidisciplinary approach** involving neurology, anesthesia, and surgery teams to optimize disease control and plan perioperative management [^113NRHjj]. Continue pyridostigmine up to the day of surgery to prevent withdrawal-related exacerbations, and perform a thorough assessment of respiratory function, including pulmonary function tests and arterial blood gas analysis when indicated [^1124eMLn].

---

### Intraoperative management

- **Minimize or avoid neuromuscular blockade**: Use minimal or no NMBs when possible. If NMBs are necessary, administer reduced doses (30–50% of standard doses) and monitor neuromuscular function quantitatively with train-of-four monitoring [^1124eMLn] [^1125x9HA].

- **Preferential use of sugammadex**: Sugammadex is the preferred reversal agent for rocuronium or vecuronium due to its rapid and reliable reversal, although careful monitoring is still required [^112cMoW4].

- **Regional anesthesia**: Regional anesthesia techniques, such as neuraxial blocks, are preferred when feasible to avoid systemic NMBs and reduce respiratory complications [^112Vi9LL].

---

### Postoperative care

Postoperative care should include **close monitoring** in a high-dependency or intensive care unit for patients with significant respiratory involvement or those requiring NMBs. Continue pyridostigmine and other immunosuppressive therapies as soon as feasible postoperatively, and regularly assess respiratory function, bulbar function, and overall neuromuscular status to detect early signs of myasthenic crisis or respiratory compromise [^113NRHjj].

---

## Comparison with generalized myasthenia gravis

Patients with purely ocular MG have a **lower risk of perioperative complications** than those with generalized MG, primarily due to the absence of widespread muscle involvement. However, the risk is not negligible, and careful perioperative management is still required [^117DWAs8] [^115sHx2K].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Aspect** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Preoperative preparation | - Multidisciplinary approach <br/> - Continue pyridostigmine <br/> - Assess respiratory function [^113NRHjj] [^1124eMLn] |
| Intraoperative management | - Minimize NMBs <br/> - Use sugammadex for reversal <br/> - Prefer regional anesthesia [^1124eMLn] [^112cMoW4] |
| Postoperative care | - Close monitoring <br/> - Continue immunosuppressive therapy <br/> - Regular assessment of respiratory and bulbar function [^113NRHjj] |

Patients with purely ocular myasthenia gravis have a **lower but non-negligible risk** of perioperative complications under general anesthesia compared to generalized MG. The primary concerns are increased sensitivity to non-depolarizing muscle relaxants, prolonged neuromuscular blockade, and potential respiratory complications. Careful preoperative preparation, minimal use of neuromuscular blockade, preferential use of sugammadex for reversal, and close postoperative monitoring are essential to minimize risks [^1124eMLn] [^112cMoW4].

Recommendations

Ophthalmoparesis or ptosis in ocular MG that is not responding to anticholinesterase agents should be treated with immunosuppressant agents if symptoms are functionally limiting or troublesome to the patient (median 9, range 7–9).
Corticosteroids should be used as the initial IS agent in ocular MG. Steroid-sparing IS agents may be needed when corticosteroids alone are ineffective, contraindicated, or not tolerated (median 9, range 6–9).
Data from a single small RCT suggest that low-dose corticosteroids may be effective for ocular MG and may avoid side effects associated with high-dose corticosteroids (median 9, range 4–9).
AChR-Ab+ patients with ocular MG who do not respond adequately to acetylcholinesterases and who either prefer not to take IS therapy or have contraindications to or are refractory to IS agents may be offered thymectomy (median 8, range 5–9) (table e-10).

### Myasthenia gravis: a clinical-immunological update [^116TpJuN]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Myasthenia gravis (MG) represents the archetypic disorder of both the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and autoantibody-mediated disease. In most patients, IgG1-dominant antibodies to acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) cause fatigable weakness of skeletal muscles with an ocular onset in up to 85%. A variable proportion of patients lacking AChR antibodies, termed seronegative MG (SNMG), possess antibodies to muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) and intriguingly, these antibodies are principally IgG4. The remainder of SNMG is now rapidly being explained via cell-based assays (CBAs) using a receptor-clustering technique, and, to a lesser extent, proposed new antigenic targets.

The incidence and prevalence of MG are increasing, particularly in older individuals. However, MG remains a rare disease and there are well-documented impediments to clinical trials including low participant recruitment. Indeed, the EPITOME trial in ocular MG (OMG) had to close recently due to failure to recruit adequate numbers. Nevertheless, rituximab appears to show promise in MuSK MG and a much-anticipated randomised controlled trial (RCT) of thymectomy in non-thymomatous MG is due to report in early 2016. These results will be of great value since thymectomy has been offered for many years in this setting, without incontrovertible evidence of benefit compared to purely medical management.

Expert clinical guidelines have reviewed pregnancy in MG, and management guidelines have been published for OMG and generalised MG (GMG) (with some comments on OMG). This review will focus on GMG, as recent updates on congenital myasthenia and OMG have already been published. However, in addition to the epidemiology, immunology, therapeutics and clinical management of GMG, ongoing efforts to define the risk of generalisation (ROG) from ocular to generalised MG will be described.

This finding has also a surprising effect on the relationship between MGFA class and CSR. Indeed, if we do not consider the year of surgery in the model, we find that advanced MGFA class (III‐IV) patients have a worse prognosis in terms of remission (Table S2), consistent with previous reports. On the contrary, if we introduce the era of surgery, MGFA class is no more statistically significant. Probably, the better care that we are now able to give to these patients overcomes the negative impact of severe MGFA class.

On the other side, controversy persists regarding the indication for thymectomy in patients with MGFA class I, although about 60% of them will ultimately progress to a generalization of symptoms and the significant side effects of the immunosuppressive treatments. Moreover, Li and colleagues have demonstrated that the rate of CSR in MGFA I patients is higher if operated on before generalization. Unfortunately, we can't support this finding as we don't actually know how many patients had only ocular symptoms at the beginning of the disease and eventually progressed to a generalized form, as we recorded only the preoperative MGFA. Among MGFA class I patients, we recorded just 2 (3.5%) cases that had a worsening of symptoms after surgery, one with generalization of MG. Because of these considerations, we offer thymectomy also to MGFA class I patients after thorough discussion with the patient and the referring neurologist. Furthermore, among these patients we reported only two complications (3.5%) and a CSR incidence at 5 years of 28% and at 10 years of 63% (Figure S2), therefore we are confident that we are offering them a safe and effective operation.

In our series, we failed to demonstrate the association between CSR and histology, seropositive MG, early operation after symptoms onset, weight of the specimen, and presence of ectopic thymic tissue. Regarding these two last points, we can make some considerations. First of all, the meaning of the finding of ectopic thymic tissue and of its removal is still ambiguous. According to different studies, its presence seems to negatively relate to symptoms' remission, while others did not find these results. Also, in our series, we did not find an association between the presence of ectopic tissue and the neurological outcomes. We must consider that the presence of ectopic foci is quite low in our study (18%), although this could also be related to the low number of patients with normal or atrophic thymus (in whom the ectopic foci seem to be more frequent).

### Myasthenia gravis and pregnancy: anaesthetic management – a series of cases [^112Vi9LL]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune neuromuscular disease, usually affecting women in the second and third decades. The course is unpredictable during pregnancy and puerperium. Myasthenia gravis can cause major interference in labour and partum and exacerbations of the disease frequently occur. The aim of this series of cases is to analyse retrospectively the anaesthetic management of myasthenia gravis patients and complications during the peripartum period.

Materials and Methods

Retrospective, single centre study from clinical files of female myasthenia gravis patients who delivered between 1985 and 2007 at Hospital de Santo António, Porto, Portugal.

Results

Seventeen myasthenia gravis patients delivered between 1985 and 2007 in Hospital Santo António. Two women were not included in the study as they had a spontaneous abortion in the first trimester. Four patients presented exacerbations of the disease during pregnancy, no exacerbation occurred in eight patients and three patients presented their first symptoms of myasthenia gravis during pregnancy (without diagnosis at time of delivery). Concerning the eight patients without exacerbations of the disease during pregnancy, pregnancy was brought to term in 87.5% of the cases; five women were submitted to nonurgent caesarean section (62.5%); and epidural block was performed in six patients (75%). No complications related to anaesthesia occurred in the peripartum period. Concerning the four patients with exacerbations of the disease, pregnancy was brought to term in three cases (75%); three women were submitted to nonurgent caesarean section (75%); and epidural block was performed in three patients (75%). One patient underwent an uncomplicated thymectomy under general anaesthesia during pregnancy and, in the postpartum period, there was a myasthenic crisis in another patient. Concerning the three patients without a myasthenia gravis diagnosis at partum, one woman already being followed for presenting muscular weakness had a vaginal delivery under epidural block, without complications; another patient, presenting discrete supine dyspnoea, was submitted to elective caesarean section under spinal block and developed severe dyspnoea that required mechanical ventilation and ICU admission; and in the remaining case, a woman presenting mild blurred vision was submitted to general anaesthesia, which resulted in delayed emergence, muscular weakness and respiratory failure. Pregnancy went full term in all cases (100%). No newborn had a myasthenic crisis.

Conclusion

Myasthenia gravis can interfere slightly with pregnancy and partum, although exacerbations of the disease occur frequently. Strict surveillance and therapeutic optimisation are crucial. In women with controlled disease, caesarean section should be carried out only if there are obstetric reasons. Locoregional anaesthesia is preferred, mainly epidural block. A good multidisciplinary cooperation, specific precautions and surveillance can certainly contribute to an improved outcome in myasthenia gravis patients during the peripartum period.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: 2020 update [^111tqDvM]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

A retrospective case series of 110 patients with ocular MG who underwent extended transsternal thymectomy reported that at a median follow-up of 33.5 months, 26% achieved complete remission (defined as asymptomatic without medications for 12 months). Five patients had a thymoma. A retrospective case series of 49 nonthymomatous ocular MG and 12 ocular MG with thymoma undergoing thymectomy followed for a mean duration of 9 years reported a cure defined as asymptomatic without the need for medications in 51%. In yet another retrospective case series of transcervical thymectomy in MG, 57% of 12 patients with ocular MG achieved MGFA postintervention status (PIS) of complete stable remission (CSR)at 5 years. A subsequent case series of 151 patients with MG who underwent transcervical thymectomy followed for 5 years showed a higher odds ratio for remission in ocular MG compared with generalized MG without controlling for other variables (analysis performed by P.N.). In 12 patients with ocular MG undergoing thymectomy because of an abnormal chest CT scan, all but one required additional immunosuppression after thymectomy; 6 achieved remission at a mean follow-up of 81 months. In a retrospective analysis of 50 patients with juvenile MG undergoing thymectomy, of whom 46% were ocular, 50% showed improved PIS at a mean of 3.5 years of follow-up. There was no difference between ocular and generalized MG. In a meta-analysis of 26 studies of thymectomy in nonthymomatous MG, the pooled CSR rate was 0.51. There was high heterogeneity in the meta-analysis model, indicating substantial differences among the included studies.

Myasthenia gravis — clinical objectives and thymectomy: Clinical objectives are to "Recognize the disorder to initiate an appropriate workup and referral to other subspecialties, including neurology" and to "Ensure that proper medical and surgical treatment is provided, and initiate short-term and subsequent long-term management of associated ptosis and strabismus". Thymectomy is indicated, certainly in the presence of thymoma but also for specific age-based and immune-based characteristics for which it may substantially reduce clinical symptoms.

Ongoing research into histological differences between patients might advance patient stratification or prognostication in the future. One digital analysis of thymic samples found a positive correlation between the number of ectopic germinal centers and post-operative improvement in nonthymomatous MG. However, it is important to recognize the limitations of conventional imaging to detect thymic hyperplasia; in a retrospective study of 106 cases from our center, MRI thorax missed all such cases, whereas the sensitivity of CT thorax, while better, was still only 28.6%. Therefore, histological diagnoses should not be conferred on imaging findings alone.

Around 15% of MG patients lack detectable serum AChR antibodies. Within this subgroup, immunoreactivity is directed against proteins such as muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) or low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4). There is limited evidence supporting the efficacy of thymectomy in these patients. Observational data indicate that thymectomy has a therapeutic benefit in a proportion of juvenile MG patients, but it remains to be seen whether this is sustained over extended periods. Finally, in ocular MG (OMG), thymectomy is only indicated in patients in whom pharmacological agents fail or are altogether contraindicated.

In summary, thymectomy will certainly remain a cornerstone of MG management in patients with AChR antibodies. Advances in surgical techniques, patient stratification and disease pathology will continue to influence patient outcomes. Furthermore, real-world data should provide insights into the remission rates and risk of thymoma recurrence associated with novel minimally invasive techniques. Where possible, advancements should be bolstered by evidence from prospective studies to bridge the gaps in current understanding.

The expanding treatment landscape in myasthenia gravis

Treatment goals in MG can be conceptualized as meeting three goals at the pathophysiological level: (1) protecting the neuromuscular junction; (2) removing the effector cell types responsible for producing pathogenic antibodies and/or the antibodies themselves from circulation (Figs. 1–3); and (3) reducing or even halting the process of autoimmunization which underlies the autoimmune attack. At the time of our previous review, most available treatments were accepted through retrospective use and expert opinion, although they could be broadly categorized as belonging to the first two of these groups. However, historically available immunosuppressive options come with notable side effects (corticosteroids and azathioprine), require frequent, inconvenient pulsing (intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and plasma exchange), and may be inadequate to control disease in up to 15% of cases.

### A controlled clinical study on efficacy and safety of periocular triamcinolone acetonide injection for treating ocular myasthenia gravis [^112MC8Ax]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

There are several risk factors that may affect the generalization of OMG, including patient's age of onset, degree of initial symptoms, anti-AChR-Ab positive rate, and thymoma. Among those risk factors, we found that the concentration of anti-AChR-Ab is related to the generalize conversion rate. Our finding is consistent with previous research.

Although complications with periocular injections of steroids are not common, they can still occur, such as globe perforation, arterial occlusion, toxic optic neuropathy, or atrophy of subcutaneous tissue in the face, all of which should be taken seriously. Patients should be closely monitored for any signs of complications, and healthcare providers should follow proper injection techniques to minimize the risk of complications. In this study, the patient's intraocular pressure was stable during the treatment period. There were no other complications, except for intra frame hematoma, indicating that local medication is safer than systemic medication. However, local pain and patient fear caused by injection are important factors that affect patients' long-term adherence to treatment. To this end, it is necessary to provide them with education and support to address any concerns or fears they may have about injections. Sustained-release agents with longer therapeutic durations may also be a viable option for improving patient acceptance of treatment. Ultimately, the choice of treatment should be based on individual patient factors and preferences, as well as careful consideration of the potential benefits and risks of each treatment option.

Conclusion: based on the study's findings, it seems that repeated peribulbar injection of triamcinolone acetonide can be an effective treatment for initial symptoms of ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG) and may have the potential to reduce the use of other drugs, thereby minimizing associated side effects. Additionally, it may reduce the risk of secondary generalized myasthenia gravis (GMG) in the long run. However, further research is needed to confirm the long-term efficacy of this treatment and to explore any potential complications associated with long-term local hormone injection.

5.6 Potentiation of Muscle Weakness

Beta-adrenergic blockade has been reported to potentiate muscle weakness consistent with certain myasthenic symptoms (e.g., diplopia, ptosis, and generalized weakness). Timolol has been reported rarely to increase muscle weakness in some patients with myasthenia gravis or myasthenic symptoms.

5.7 Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus

Beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be administered with caution in patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia or to diabetic patients (especially those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents may mask the signs and symptoms of acute hypoglycemia.

5.8 Masking of Thyrotoxicosis

Beta-adrenergic blocking agents may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents that might precipitate a thyroid storm.

5.9 Ocular Hypersensitivity

Ocular hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions 0.2%, with some reported to be associated with an increase in intraocular pressure [see Contraindications (4.4)].

5.10 Contamination of Topical Ophthalmic Products After Use

There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple-dose containers of topical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

5.11 Impairment of Beta-adrenergically Mediated Reflexes During Surgery

The necessity or desirability of withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents prior to major surgery is controversial. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade impairs the ability of the heart to respond to beta-adrenergically mediated reflex stimuli. This may augment the risk of general anesthesia in surgical procedures. Some patients receiving beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents have experienced protracted severe hypotension during anesthesia. Difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has also been reported. For these reasons, in patients undergoing elective surgery, some authorities recommend gradual withdrawal of beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents.

If necessary during surgery, the effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may be reversed by sufficient doses of adrenergic agonists.

### Failure of reversion of neuromuscular block with sugammadex in patient with myasthenia gravis: case report and brief review of literature [^114qywHd]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Myasthenia Gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease that affects the neuromuscular junction and neuromuscular transmission, therefore it causes muscle weakness. The most common form involves antibodies against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AchR), reaching up to 80% of the cases. The phenotype can also vary, with several muscle groups affected in different ways. The most commonly affected are the eyes muscles. The most serious manifestations are the myasthenic crisis (MC) and the cholinergic crisis.

MG patients are a challenge for anesthesiologists in several aspects. Antibiotics, sedatives, inhalational anesthetics and surgical stress can trigger its symptoms. In this scenario, neuromuscular blocking agent (NMB) use increases the risk of residual paralysis. Succinylcholine is not recommended for myasthenia as it has a slower onset of action and a delayed recovery. The myasthenic patient has greater sensitivity to nondepolarizing NMB due to the reduced number of functional AChR. Sugammadex may be a safe option in the reversal of neuromuscular blockade by rocuronium. This duet may be considered the first choice when neuromuscular block in MG patients is needed. However, there are some cases in the literature that report failures with these drugs in myasthenic patients as well as in patients without myasthenia. The purpose of this case report is to highlight the importance of cholinesterase inhibitors management and neuromuscular block monitoring in the perioperative period of myasthenic patients, even with the use of rocuronium-sugammadex. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient.

### Generalization after ocular onset in myasthenia gravis: a case series in Germany [^114eCaFT]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Approximately, 50% of myasthenia gravis (MG) patients initially present with purely ocular symptoms. Of these, about 60% will develop secondary generalized MG, typically within 2 years. Risk factors for secondary generalization are still controversial. In this study, we reviewed clinical parameters, thymic pathologies and medical treatments of MG patients with purely ocular symptoms at onset to investigate risk factors for secondary generalization.

Methods

In this monocentric retrospective study, we reviewed consecutive patients who underwent robotic thymectomy between January 2003 and October 2017 in Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin. We used univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models to identify factors associated with secondary generalization. Survival curves were plotted using Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank tests were performed to analyze the association between corticosteroids use and secondary generalization in subgroups defined by anti-AChR antibody status and thymic pathology.

Results

One hundred and eighty of 572 MG patients who underwent robotic thymectomy were eligible for inclusion, of whom 110 (61.1%) developed a secondary generalized MG over a mean follow-up time of 23.6 months. The presence of a thymoma (HR 1.659, 95% CI (1.52–2.617), P = 0.029) was the only risk factor for secondary generalization in our series. Treating with corticosteroids was associated with a lower conversion rate in ocular myasthenia patients with thymic hyperplasia (n = 55, P = 0.028), but not with other thymic pathologies including thymoma and normal or atrophic thymus.

Conclusions

The conversion rate in ocular myasthenia was high in our series, predicted by the presence of a thymoma. Our findings suggest that corticosteroids can prevent secondary generalization in ocular myasthenia patients with thymic hyperplasia, which requires further research.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: executive summary [^111aoKif]. Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for myasthenia gravis, more specifically with respect to thymectomy, MGFA 2016 guidelines recommend to perform thymectomy as an option to potentially avoid or minimize the dose or duration of immunotherapy in patients with non-thymomatous MG, or if patients fail to respond to an initial trial of immunotherapy or have intolerable side effects from that therapy. Recognize that thymectomy for MG is an elective procedure because of the long delay in onset of effect. Perform thymectomy when the patient is stable and deemed safe to undergo a procedure where postoperative pain and mechanical factors can limit respiratory function.

### Experience with programmed steroid treatment with thymectomy in nonthymomatous myasthenia gravis [^114EDLCJ]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The benefit of thymectomy in myasthenia gravis management is recognized but the perioperative course can fluctuate. The goal of this study was to assess the feasibility and clinical benefit of dose-escalated steroid therapy with thymectomy for nonthymomatous myasthenia gravis.

Methods

We reviewed the records of 69 myasthenia gravis patients who were followed up after undergoing transsternal thymectomy with extended anterior mediastinal dissection in our hospital between 1976–2000. Forty-eight patients in the programmed treatment group who had dose-escalated and de-escalated steroid therapy during the perioperative period comprised 17 patients with ocular myasthenia gravis and 31 patients with generalized myasthenia gravis. Clinical benefits and clinical remission, which was diagnosed when the patients were symptom-free without medications for at least 1 year, were compared with those of 21 patients in the occasional treatment group who received medications occasionally over the perioperative period.

Results

Postoperative respiratory failure and myasthenic crisis did not occur in the programmed treatment group but did occur in 6 patients in the occasional treatment group. Remission rates in the programmed treatment group (mean follow-up, 6.4 years) were 30% at 3 years, 38% at 5 years, and 46% at 10 years; rates in the occasional treatment group (mean follow-up, 9.6 years) were 25% at 3 years, 25% at 5 years, and 45% at 10 years.

Conclusions

Programmed steroid therapy in patients with nonthymomatous myasthenia gravis is feasible and it provides clinical benefit when fluctuating symptoms occur during the perioperative period.

### EFNS / ENS guidelines for the treatment of ocular myasthenia [^116B4VAL]. European Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The symptoms of acquired autoimmune ocular myasthenia are restricted to the extrinsic eye muscles, causing double vision and drooping eyelids. These guidelines are designed to provide advice about best clinical practice based on the current state of clinical and scientific knowledge and the consensus of an expert panel.

Search Strategy

Evidence for these guidelines was collected by searches in the MEDLINE and Cochrane databases. The task force working group reviewed evidence from original articles and systematic reviews. The evidence was classified (I, II, III, IV) and consensus recommendation graded (A, B or C) according to the EFNS guidance. Where there was a lack of evidence but clear consensus, good practice points are provided.

Conclusions

The treatment of ocular myasthenia should initially be started with pyridostigmine (good practice point). If this is not successful in relieving symptoms, oral corticosteroids should be used on an alternate-day regimen (recommendation level C). If steroid treatment does not result in good control of the symptoms or if it is necessary to use high steroid doses, steroid-sparing treatment with azathioprine should be started (recommendation level C). If ocular myasthenia gravis is associated with thymoma, thymectomy is indicated. Otherwise, the role of thymectomy in ocular myasthenia is controversial. Steroids and thymectomy may modify the course of ocular myasthenia and prevent myasthenia gravis generalization (good practice point).

### Myasthenia gravis [^113pkdFU]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on myasthenia gravis:

- **Definition**: MG is an autoimmune disorder characterized by fatigable muscle weakness which results from antibodies targeting the postsynaptic neuromuscular membrane.
- **Pathophysiology**: MG is caused by autoantibodies directed mainly against AChRs, muscle-specific kinase, and lipoprotein receptor-related peptide.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence and prevalence rate of MG is estimated at 0.53 cases per 100,000 person-years and 7.8 persons per 100,000 population, respectively.
- **Disease course**: Antibodies belonging to IgG1 and IgG3 subclass direct antibodies mainly against AChRs, which disrupt neuromuscular transmission causing ocular, oropharyngeal, limb, axial, and respiratory muscle weakness. Thymoma and myasthenia crisis may even cause death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Mortality associated with MG is about 5–14%.

### Local use of dexamethasone in the treatment of ocular myasthenia gravis [^1144rjGU]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Before formal treatment was initiated, all patients and their families were given detailed information about their condition and various treatment methods, including the advantages and disadvantages of each. After an understanding of the risks involved was achieved, all patients or their parents signed an written informed consent form approved by the institutional Review Board. We also obtained explicit written informed consent to publish all data related to the study (including individual details, images, and videos) from the patients or their parents (for children < 18 years of age).

All patients received local injections of dexamethasone in the peribulbar region or extraocular muscle, once a week, for 4–6 times. The site of injection was determined based on the patient's ocular signs. In the case of a clear limitation of ocular duction, dexamethasone was directly injected into the main paralyzed extraocular muscle. If the main symptom was ptosis, with no limitation of ocular duction, a peribulbar injection of dexamethasone was administered to the inferolateral orbital quadrant. Patients were closely observed with regard to ocular position and movement, diplopia and degree of blepharoptosis, visual acuity, intraocular pressure and general condition. If the symptoms did not improve after two injections, if the patient's condition worsened at any time, or if any sign of GMG (any muscle weakness below the neck or in the facial muscles except the orbicularis oculi) appeared, the treatment plan was discontinued, and the patient was transferred to the neurology department. After treatment, the patients were followed up monthly for 6 months, or at any sign of disease recurrence.

Extraocular muscle injection

Patients assigned to the extraocular muscle injections group received 0.5% dexamethasone (0.2 mL) and 2% lidocaine (0.2 mL). After topical anesthesia with proparacaine, the clinician disinfected the skin around the eye and the conjunctival surface with 5% povidone iodine. The eyelid was opened, and the paralyzed extraocular muscle was clamped with toothed forceps. Injections were administered with 30G needles, which were inserted at the point of extraocular muscle attachment, then advanced 8–10 mm along the muscle to inject dexamethasone directly into the muscle sheath.

Peribulbar injection

Patients assigned to the peribulbar injection group received 0.5% dexamethasone (0.5 mL), which was administered with an 27G needle. The drug was slowly injected inside the orbital rim of the inferolateral quadrant, posterior to the orbital septum.

5.6 Potentiation of Muscle Weakness

Beta-adrenergic blockade has been reported to potentiate muscle weakness consistent with certain myasthenic symptoms (e.g., diplopia, ptosis, and generalized weakness). Timolol has been reported rarely to increase muscle weakness in some patients with myasthenia gravis or myasthenic symptoms.

5.7 Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus

Beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be administered with caution in patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia or to diabetic patients (especially those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents may mask the signs and symptoms of acute hypoglycemia.

5.8 Masking of Thyrotoxicosis

Beta-adrenergic blocking agents may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents that might precipitate a thyroid storm.

RESULTS

All definitions below obtained simple consensus and all guidance statements below were agreed upon as being appropriate by the panel. Literature summaries and tables for medication dosing guidance and medication cautions are available as supplemental data at.

Preliminary definitions.

1. Goals for the treatment of MG.

MGFA Task Force Post-Intervention Status (PIS) classification Minimal Manifestation Status (MMS) or better, with no more than grade 1 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) medication side effects.

MMS: The patient has no symptoms or functional limitations from MG but has some weakness on examination of some muscles. This class recognizes that some patients who otherwise meet the definition of remission have mild weakness.

CTCAE grade 1 medication side effects: asymptomatic or only mild symptoms; intervention not indicated.

2. Definition of remission.

The patient has no symptoms or signs of MG. Weakness of eyelid closure is accepted, but there is no weakness of any other muscle on careful examination. Patients taking cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) every day with reasonable evidence to support symptomatic benefit are therefore excluded from this category.

3. Definition of ocular MG (based on dysfunction due to MG at a specified point in time, and not dependent upon the duration of disease).

MGFA Class I: Any ocular muscle weakness. May have weakness of eye closure. Strength in all other facial, bulbar, and limb muscles is normal. (It is recognized that some patients report fatigue when strength testing is normal. The physician should use clinical judgment in attributing fatigue to generalized MG in the absence of objective nonocular weakness).

4. Definition of impending myasthenic crisis.

Rapid clinical worsening of MG that, in the opinion of the treating physician, could lead to crisis in the short term (days to weeks).

5. Definition of manifest myasthenic crisis (the concept of crisis focuses on the clinical implications — it represents a serious, life-threatening, rapid worsening of MG and potential airway compromise from ventilatory or bulbar dysfunction).

MGFA Class V: Worsening of myasthenic weakness requiring intubation or noninvasive ventilation to avoid intubation, except when these measures are employed during routine postoperative management (the use of a feeding tube without intubation places the patient in MGFA Class IVB).

6. Definition of refractory MG.

PISis unchanged or worse after corticosteroids and at least 2 other IS agents, used in adequate doses for an adequate duration, with persistent symptoms or side effects that limit functioning, as defined by patient and physician.

### Thyroid eye disease and ocular myasthenia gravis [^115sUfBR]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

An overview of two ocular diseases, which significantly impact quality of life: thyroid eye disease (TED) and ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG). Additionally, we describe the clinical challenge when they occur simultaneously. We will describe the pathophysiology of both conditions, the currently available diagnostic tools, and the therapies available.

Recent Findings

Recent literature has described newer diagnostic modalities, predictors of disease severity and co-occurrence of TED and OMG, and novel therapies. There is also critical analysis of current therapeutics and risk factors.

Summary

The findings from this review suggest a need for heightened clinical awareness and early detection strategies for TED and OMG due to their overlapping clinical presentation. Emerging therapies and diagnostic techniques should be integrated into practice. Further research is warranted to explore the long-term safety and efficacy of novel treatments and the potential genetic links between these conditions.

Although the neuromuscular disorder known as myasthenia gravis was first described in the seventeenth century, 1 it was not until two centuries later that Erb2 and Goldflam3 firmly established the clinical features of this disease. During the next half century, references in the literature dealt mainly with the clinical and pathological aspects of the disease, and this information is well summarized by Keschner and Strauss. 4 Relatively little progress was made in our understanding of the pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis until the advent of the theory of chemical mediation of nerve impulses at synaptic junctions. With the recognition of the importance of acetylcholine in the transmission of the nerve impulse at the motor end plate in striated muscles, there rapidly developed intense interest in both physiologic and pathophysiologic aspects of this mechanism. This interest has been maintained and has led to many significant advances in our knowledge with SCHLEZINGER NS, FAIRFAX WA.

IVIg and PLEX.

1. PLEX and IVIg are appropriately used as short-term treatments in patients with MG with life-threatening signs such as respiratory insufficiency or dysphagia; in preparation for surgery in patients with significant bulbar dysfunction; when a rapid response to treatment is needed; when other treatments are insufficiently effective; and prior to beginning corticosteroids if deemed necessary to prevent or minimize exacerbations.
2. The choice between PLEX and IVIg depends on individual patient factors (e.g. PLEX cannot be used in patients with sepsis and IVIg cannot be used in renal failure) and on the availability of each.
3. IVIg and PLEX are probably equally effective in the treatment of severe generalized MG.
4. The efficacy of IVIg is less certain in milder MG or in ocular MG.
5. PLEX may be more effective than IVIg in MuSK-MG.
6. The use of IVIg as maintenance therapy can be considered for patients with refractory MG or for those in whom IS agents are relatively contraindicated.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: executive summary [^117Y1CKs]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop formal consensus-based guidance for the management of myasthenia gravis (MG).

Methods

In October 2013, the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America appointed a Task Force to develop treatment guidance for MG, and a panel of 15 international experts was convened. The RAND/UCLA appropriateness methodology was used to develop consensus guidance statements. Definitions were developed for goals of treatment, minimal manifestations, remission, ocular MG, impending crisis, crisis, and refractory MG. An in-person panel meeting then determined 7 treatment topics to be addressed. Initial guidance statements were developed from literature summaries. Three rounds of anonymous e-mail votes were used to attain consensus on guidance statements modified on the basis of panel input.

Results

Guidance statements were developed for symptomatic and immunosuppressive treatments, IV immunoglobulin and plasma exchange, management of impending and manifest myasthenic crisis, thymectomy, juvenile MG, MG associated with antibodies to muscle-specific tyrosine kinase, and MG in pregnancy.

Conclusion

This is an international formal consensus of MG experts intended to be a guide for clinicians caring for patients with MG worldwide.

5.5 Increased Reactivity to Allergens

While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of atopy or a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic challenge with such allergens. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic reactions.

5.6 Potentiation of Muscle Weakness

5.9 Renal and Hepatic Impairment

Dorzolamide has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min). Because dorzolamide and its metabolite are excreted predominantly by the kidney, dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is not recommended in such patients.

Dorzolamide has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment and should therefore be used with caution in such patients.

### Clinical practice guidelines for sustained neuromuscular blockade in the adult critically ill patient [^1124eMLn]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Patients with myasthenia gravis receiving neuromuscular blocking agents — dosing, monitoring, and interactions: We recommend that a reduced dose of an NMBA be used for patients with myasthenia gravis and that the dose should be based on PNS with TOF monitoring (good practice statement), and we make no recommendation on which muscle group should be monitored in patients with myasthenia gravis undergoing treatment with NMBAs (insufficient evidence). Sensitivity to NMBAs varies greatly among patients with myasthenia, and individual assessment is necessary; patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors are at risk for experiencing prolonged neuromuscular blockade due to prolonged inactivation of succinylcholine, pyridostigmine inhibits the metabolism of mivacurium and therefore delays recovery, and discontinuing the cholinesterase inhibitor on the day of surgery increases the risk of respiratory distress.

### Clinical characteristics associated with secondary generalization in patients with ocular myasthenia gravis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116W5YEX]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG) is an autoimmune disorder resulting in ocular symptoms such as diplopia and ptosis. The proportion of patients who convert to secondary generalized myasthenia gravis (SGMG) reported in the literature has been varied. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the clinical characteristics of patients with OMG and the proportion of SGMG conversion.

Methods

We conducted an electronic database search for randomized controlled trials, prospective nonrandomized studies, observational studies, and retrospective studies in EMBASE, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Web of Science. We included studies with patients with OMG who initially presented with ocular symptoms and signs only and were seen in clinical practice, reporting on the characteristics and outcomes of SGMG. We excluded studies with pediatric and congenital myasthenia gravis populations. Eligible studies included articles written in any language and containing data on patients with OMG. The main outcome measured was the proportion of patients with OMG who converted to SGMG and risk factors associated with secondary generalization of OMG. Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts and extracted data from full texts, reporting findings according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The methodology was evaluated using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal forms. PROSPERO registration number: CRD2021285257.

Results

Thirty-one studies were included in the quantitative and qualitative analysis. The proportion of generalization ranged from 11% to 84%. The pooled proportion was 39% (95% CI 32%-47%, I² = 95.86%, p < 0.001 unweighted, low certainty). The pooled risk ratio of female sex for conversion to SGMG was 1.06 (95% CI 0.96–1.17, I² = 0% p = 0.614, 21 studies included, very low certainty), and the pooled risk ratio of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) positivity was 1.30 (95% CI 1.05–1.56, I² = 0% p = 0.455, 16 studies included, very low certainty).

Discussion

Risk factors such as female sex and anti-AChR positivity have been identified to have possible associations with SGMG, but there are not enough quality observational studies. There is a need for a prospective global database of patients with OMG, including all countries with different populations.

While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of atopy or a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic challenge with such allergens. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic reactions.

5.6 Potentiation of Muscle Weakness

Beta-adrenergic blockade has been reported to potentiate muscle weakness consistent with certain myasthenic symptoms (e.g., diplopia, ptosis, and generalized weakness). Timolol has been reported rarely to increase muscle weakness in some patients with myasthenia gravis or myasthenic symptoms.

5.7 Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus

Beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be administered with caution in patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia or to diabetic patients (especially those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents may mask the signs and symptoms of acute hypoglycemia.

5.8 Masking of Thyrotoxicosis

Beta-adrenergic blocking agents may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents that might precipitate a thyroid storm.

5.9 Renal and Hepatic Impairment

Dorzolamide has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min). Because dorzolamide and its metabolite are excreted predominantly by the kidney, Dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is not recommended in such patients.

Dorzolamide has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment and should therefore be used with caution in such patients.

5.10 Impairment of Beta-Adrenergically Mediated Reflexes during Surgery

The necessity or desirability of withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents prior to major surgery is controversial. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade impairs the ability of the heart to respond to beta-adrenergically mediated reflex stimuli. This may augment the risk of general anesthesia in surgical procedures. Some patients receiving beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents have experienced protracted severe hypotension during anesthesia. Difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has also been reported. For these reasons, in patients undergoing elective surgery, some authorities recommend gradual withdrawal of beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents.

If necessary during surgery, the effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may be reversed by sufficient doses of adrenergic agonists.

### The effect of early prednisolone treatment on the generalization rate in ocular myasthenia gravis [^111dj2Wd]. European Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Several small retrospective studies have observed that patients with a purely ocular manifestation of myasthenia gravis (MG) are significantly less likely to convert to a generalized disease when treated early on with corticosteroids. However, given the limited number of reported patients in the literature these findings still remain controversial.

Methods

In order to increase the number of published cases, we performed a retrospective analysis on 44 patients with newly diagnosed ocular MG who were subsequently either treated with corticosteroids or received no immunosuppressive therapy at all. The generalization rate was assessed at the end of a 2-year follow-up period.

Results

Whereas none of 17 treated patients generalized, 11 of 27 (41%) untreated patients developed generalized symptoms. The difference between the groups was significant (P = 0.003).

Conclusions

Our results agree well with previous studies on this issue. Taken together, published data indicate risk ratios for generalization of below 0.32 under corticosteroid treatment in comparison to untreated patients.

### Use of sugammadex in patients with neuromuscular disorders: a systematic review of case reports [^112cMoW4]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Neuromuscular transmission disorders (Table 2)

Myasthenia gravis is a common autoimmune disorder that can manifest as muscle weakness that is either generalized or isolated to ocular/bulbar muscles. It may also be associated with autonomic instability. Dosing of muscle relaxants may pose challenges in patients with myasthenia gravis. They could be resistant to suxamethonium with up to twice-normal ED 50 values, with increased risk of phase II blockade at higher doses. In contrast, patients with myasthenia gravis are sensitive to non-depolarizing relaxants due to a decreased number of acetylcholine receptors and hence a dose reduction of these drugs has been recommended. In the studies reviewed, the bolus intubating dose of rocuronium used in the patients with myasthenia gravis ranged from 0.09–1.2 mg/kg. Factors such as the use of pyridostigmine and its dose may also impact on the effects and the duration of non-depolarising agents. Moreover, since the acetylcholine esterase is already inhibited by pyridostigmine, reversing residual block with neostigmine may not be fully effective. Use of sugammadex can provide fast and reliable recovery irrespective of preoperative continuation or cessation of pyridostigmine. A large retrospective cohort study has shown a significant reduction in myasthenic crisis and hospital costs following surgery when sugammadex was used.

### Can non-thymomatous late-onset myasthenia gravis benefit from thymectomy? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111V3bmi]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

We acknowledge limitations in our study. First, the age‐defining criteria of LOMG was not consistent across studies. The studies included in our review do not fully meet these criteria and may include patients with cases of EOMG, ocular MG, and seronegative MG. Therefore, a subgroup analysis was performed in the study to minimize bias. Those published researches span from 1984 to 2022, a period marked by rapid advancements in MG treatment, including both surgical management and targeted medical therapies. There is significant heterogeneity across most estimates, likely due to variations in populations, measurement conditions, and study designs. Some pooled evaluations may under‐ or overestimate the response to thymectomy. Additionally, other factors, such as the surgical approach and the preoperative and postoperative treatments, were either not documented or lacked sufficient detail; therefore, they could not be extracted. These factors may also influence the response to thymectomy. Despite these limitations, the systematic review and meta‐analysis suggest the need to assess the potential benefit of thymectomy for LOMG.

With the rising number of elderly MG patients and the notable peak in late‐onset cases, addressing the appropriate age for thymectomy has become an urgent clinical need. However, given the likely greater potential morbidity in older patients with multiple comorbidities, surgical intervention must be tailored to the individual and preoperative care of the patient.

### Difference in sensitivity to vecuronium between patients with ocular and generalized myasthenia gravis [^114zBqrk]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2001). Low credibility.

Patients with myasthenia gravis show sensitivity to non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs, but little is known about differences in this sensitivity between types of myasthenia. In 10 patients with ocular myasthenia gravis and 10 with generalized myasthenia gravis, twitch tension was monitored in the adductor pollicis muscle by supramaximal train-of-four stimulation of the ulnar nerve during anaesthesia with sevoflurane 2.5% and nitrous oxide 60%. After baseline measurement, an initial dose of vecuronium 10 microg kg⁻¹ was given. When the twitch height stabilized (maximum block after the first 10 microg kg⁻¹)), the next incremental dose of 10 microg kg⁻¹ was given and repeated until block, defined as [1−(first twitch/baseline first twitch)] × 100 reached 90%. Maximum block after the first dose of vecuronium in ocular patients was significantly less than that in generalized patients (median 51 vs 91%; P < 0.05). Onset of block after the first dose of vecuronium was significantly slower in ocular than in generalized myasthenic patients (mean 300 vs 200 s; P < 0.05). Doses required to attain a block of 90% or more were significantly higher in ocular than in generalized patients (median 20 vs 10 microg kg⁻¹; P < 0.05). Clinicians should consider the type of disease according to the Osserman classification when using non-depolarizing neuromuscular. blocking drugs in patients with myasthenia gravis.

### Ocular myasthenia: diagnostic and treatment recommendations and the evidence base [^116Z6tVW]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Increasing rigor is being applied to medical decision making, but myasthenia gravis, commonly considered the best understood autoimmune disorder from a pathophysiological basis, lags other disciplines in the evidence base used to make clinical decisions. The review attempts to provide a focused, practical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of ocular myasthenia within the limits of largely retrospective case series and expert opinion.

Recent Findings

Confirmation of clinical diagnosis continues to be challenging for ocular myasthenia. Despite the recognition of a new autoantigen, the muscle-specific kinase protein in generalized myasthenia gravis, it has been found to be only rarely identified in ocular myasthenia patients and therefore the majority of patients lack detectable autoantibodies and confirmation of a neuromuscular transmission disorder relies on specialized testing of single-fiber electromyography. The visual compromise of ocular myasthenia responds poorly to nonpharmacological and cholinesterase inhibitor therapy, and although corticosteroids are thought to be extremely effective, their toxicity is poorly defined in ocular myasthenia patients and whether they reduce the risk of development of generalized disease is not known.

Summary

Rigorous clinical trials or large databases with outcome assessments are necessary in order to allow development of rational treatment strategies.

### Failure of reversion of neuromuscular block with sugammadex in patient with myasthenia gravis: case report and brief review of literature [^114zUBCh]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

In general anesthesia, several conditions that may interfere in the recovery to the neuromuscular blockade should be considered, like the unpredictability of NMBs in patients with MG, the greater sensitivity to the non-depolarizing agents, the lack of standardized dose of NMBs in these patients and the precise magnitude of anesthetic drugs (hypnotic, opioids, volatile anesthetics) interference as well as other substances. The use of rocuronium-sugammadex may not be completely predictable without neuromuscular blockade monitoring, since patients with MG may manifest MC or even MG worsening in the perioperative period, regardless of NMB. The present report adds to the literature supporting to the use of neuromuscular blockade monitoring as mandatory for surgeries in patients with MG, especially in cases where NMB is required.

### Maintenance immunosuppression in myasthenia gravis [^111pRdmJ]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2016). Low credibility.

Therapies for myasthenia gravis (MG) include symptomatic and immunosuppressive treatment. Options for immunosuppression include corticosteroids, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, methotrexate, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, intravenous immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis, and thymectomy. The practical aspects of long-term immunosuppressive therapy in MG will be critically reviewed in this article. Treatment for ocular and generalized myasthenia gravis will be discussed. Application of these therapies needs to be considered in conjunction with their efficacy, disease subtypes and severity, and patient co-morbidities.

### Anesthesia and critical care of thymectomy for myasthenia gravis [^117DWAs8]. Chest Surgery Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease resulting from the production of antibodies against the ACh receptors of the neuromuscular synapse. The thymus gland is involved in the autosensitization process, and the disease frequently is associated with thymic morphologic abnormalities. There is a consensus that all adults with generalized MG should have a thymectomy. This recommendation has been propagated by the safety of the procedure and excellent outcome. Removal of as much thymic tissue as possible (anterior mediastinal exenteration) by transsternal approach is the logical goal of thymectomy in the treatment of MG. Transcervical approach and VATS, however, are less invasive and have been used in patients who have MG unaccompanied by thymoma. Optimization of the condition of the myasthenic patients can markedly decrease the risk of surgery and improve the outcome. Two techniques have been recommended for general anesthesia in the myasthenic patient. Because of the unpredictable response to succinylcholine and the marked sensitivity to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants, some anesthesiologists avoid muscle relaxants and depend on deep inhalational anesthesia, such as halothane, isoflurane, or sevoflurane, for tracheal intubation and maintenance of anesthesia. Others, however, use a balanced technique of anesthesia that includes the use of carefully titrated muscle relaxants. The most important preoperative factor predicting the need for postoperative mechanical ventilation is the severity of bulbar involvement (Ossermann group 3 and 4), usually indicated by significant dysphagia and dysarthria associated with borderline respiratory dysfunction. Thymectomy benefits nearly 96% of patients: 46% develop complete remission, 50% are asymptomatic or improve on therapy, and 4% remain the same. The time from diagnosis to surgery is shorter than 8 months, and mild or moderate myasthenic symptoms are the main prognostic factors that predict the best outcome after thymectomy.

### Medical and surgical treatment for ocular myasthenia [^1121ntLa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Approximately 50% of people with myasthenia gravis present initially with purely ocular symptoms, so called ocular myasthenia and between 50 to 60% of these people will progress to develop generalized disease. The vast majority will do so within the first one to two years. There is controversy surrounding the appropriate management of patients with ocular myasthenia.

Objectives

To perform a systematic review of the literature relevant to the treatment of ocular myasthenia and to answer three specific questions. Are there any medical or surgical treatments that have an impact on the risk of progression from ocular to generalized myasthenia gravis? Are there any medical or surgical treatments that improve symptoms of diplopia or ptosis in ocular myasthenia? What is the frequency of side effects associated with treatments used in people with ocular myasthenia?

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register (searched December 2004), MEDLINE (1996 to 2004) and EMBASE (1980 to 2004) for randomized controlled trials as well as case-control and cohort studies. The titles and abstracts of all articles were read by both authors and the full text of all articles that were of possible relevance was reviewed in full. The references of all manuscripts included in the review were scanned to identify additional articles of relevance and experts in the field were contacted to identify additional published and unpublished data. Where necessary and possible, we contacted authors for further information.

Selection Criteria

To be included in the review, studies had to meet three criteria: (a) randomized (or quasi-randomized) controlled study design; (b) active treatment compared to placebo, no treatment or some other treatment; and (c) results reported separately for patients with ocular myasthenia (grade 1) as defined by the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America.

Data Collection and Analysis

We collected data regarding the risk of progression to generalized myasthenia gravis, improvement in ocular symptoms, and the frequency of treatment-related side effects.

Main Results

We identified two randomized controlled trials relevant to the treatment of ocular myasthenia, only one of which reported results in terms of the pre-specified outcome measures used in this review. This study included only three participants and was of limited methodological quality. In the absence of data from randomized controlled trials, we present a review of the available observational data.

Authors' Conclusions

There are no data from randomized controlled trials on the impact of any form of treatment on the risk of progression from ocular to generalized myasthenia gravis. The available randomized controlled literature does not permit any meaningful conclusions about the efficacy of any form of treatment for ocular myasthenia. Data from several reasonably good quality observational studies suggest that corticosteroids and azathioprine may be beneficial in reducing the risk of progression to generalized myasthenia gravis.

### Intensive care due to myasthenia gravis: risk factors and prognosis [^114dfnyK]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease in which autoantibodies (Abs) disrupt neuromuscular transmission, usually targeting acetylcholine receptors (AChRs). MG can be divided into subgroups based on onset age, autoantibody status, affected muscles, and thymus pathology. Symptoms range from diplopia and ptosis in ocular MG to weakness of limbs, bulbar or respiratory muscles (generalised MG). The course of MG varies; complete remission is achieved by 22% of AChR‐Ab‐positive patients in a mean of 6 years from diagnosis, but 15%–20% of patients experience myasthenic crisis (MC), a severe exacerbation with acute respiratory failure. The prevalence of MG ranges from 5.4 to 35 per 100,000 worldwide and is 20.9 per 100,000 in Finland.

Many factors can induce MG exacerbations. Infections, especially respiratory, are the most common trigger. Other factors include surgery, pregnancy, stress, thyroid dysfunction, inadequate MG treatment and medications. Low serum potassium is speculated to worsen MG by disrupting muscle–nerve junction function. In 20%–40% of MC no precipitating factor can be identified. Patient‐specific risk factors for MG exacerbation and hospitalisation include disease onset after the age of 50 years (late‐onset MG [LOMG]), comorbidities, previous MC, Abs against muscle‐specific kinase (MuSK), thymoma and severe disease at diagnosis. Conversely, Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) minimal manifestation status after 12 months of MG diagnosis indicates lower exacerbation risk.

Bronchial asthma is another autoimmune disease sometimes requiring intensive care with mechanical ventilation. The risk factors for intensive care for asthma exacerbation partially overlap with those of MG, including infections.

Due to therapeutic advances, mortality in MC has decreased to 5%–12% in recent decades. Nevertheless, the understanding of prognostic factors for risk and outcome of severe exacerbations of MG is incomplete, and mortality among MG patients is increasing in the Nordic countries. Our study addresses the need for intensive care of people with MG (pwMG) for all reasons in our hospital district, and analyses the risk factors, features, and prognosis of MG exacerbation and MC requiring intensive care. We compare pwMG in intensive care to those admitted to regular hospital wards, those only in outpatient follow‐up, and patients requiring intensive care for bronchial asthma.

E. S. ROACHMD Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that affects the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction membrane. Acetylcholine receptor antibodies are frequently present, and the number of functioning postsynaptic receptors is reduced. Muscle-specific kinase antibodies may be identified in individuals with and without AChR antibodies. 1 Ptosis or diplopia due to ocular muscle involvement are frequently the first symptoms of the disease. 2 Approximately half of the patients are first seen with purely ocular MG; of these, 53% develop generalized MG within 2 years. Furthermore, a spontaneous remission rate of 30% has been reported in patients with OMG during a 15-year period. 3 Both AChR and muscle-specific kinase antibodies may be present in OMG.

### Risk factors of prolonged ventilation after thymectomy in thymoma myasthenia gravis patients [^113Teo76]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Although sedatives and volatile anesthetics can exacerbate MG, the best general anesthesia methods of MG patients in surgery have been contradictory. MG patients are more sensitive than normal to the neuromuscular depressant effects of halothane and isoflurane. Maddali et al. reported the safety use of sevoflurane and propofol when real-time monitoring the depth of anesthesia in a small cohort of patients undergoing transthymectomy. In contrast, Nitahara et al. have reported that sevoflurane inhibits neuromuscular transmission in a dose-dependent fashion. In our study, 60.7% of patients used intravenous-inhalational anesthesia by sevoflurane and propofol. And patients with total intravenous anesthesia have a lower risk of postoperative ventilation. Nondepolarizing NMBAs were used in 96.4% of patients, but there is no difference between two groups (p = 1.00). The complications of residual neuromuscular blockade of nodepolarizing NMBAs is common in MG patients. So, it is suggested that the amount given should be reduced to one-third or less, depending on the severity of MG disease. Regrettably, the type of nondepolarizing NMBAs we use varies among patients, so is incomparable between the drugs, and analysis their action, side effect in different anesthesia methods. Furthermore, we found more people received muscle relaxant antagonists in group 1 (p = 0.001). In general, the use of objective quantitative neuromuscular monitors is necessary when the NMBAs are used in MG patients, and the amount must be titrated to the individual.

### Expert consensus recommendations for improving and standardising the assessment of patients with generalised myasthenia gravis [^11481KYP]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Generalised myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare and chronic, immunoglobulin G (IgG)‐mediated, neuromuscular autoimmune disease, which causes debilitating and potentially life‐threatening muscle weakness. Most patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) first present with ocular symptoms only; however, approximately 80% will have gMG within 2 years of initial disease onset. gMG is classified by degree of muscle weakness, which, along with other symptoms of the disease, may vary greatly among individuals and fluctuate over time. This variation in symptoms, combined with infrequent and isolated evaluations, means accurate tracking of symptom state and full comprehension of disease burden is difficult. The impact of gMG on patient's lives can therefore be underappreciated.

In addition, the impact of gMG on key areas of patient health and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) is profound, increasing substantially with increased disease severity. Many patients also continue to experience substantial disease burden while on treatment, and poor HRQoL may persist even if gMG is considered to be well managed. Nonetheless, current measures of impairment have the potential to provide a good score‐based measure of the impact of symptoms and treatment on HRQoL in patients, if used consistently.

### Clinical features, pathogenesis, and treatment of myasthenia gravis: a supplement to the guidelines of the German Neurological Society [^113BnMrG]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is regarded an autoimmune antibody-mediated disorder of neuromuscular synaptic transmission as (a) auto-antibody depositions are detectable at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ); (b) autoantibodies from MG patients cause MG symptoms when passively transferred into rodents; (c) active immunization of animals with auto-antigens reproduces the disease; and (d) antibody-depleting therapies decrease the severity of MG symptoms.

The incidence of MG ranges from 0.25 to 2.0 per 1,000,000. Due to effective treatment strategies and normal life expectancy, the prevalence of MG has risen in recent years to about 72:1,000,000 (range 15–179). About 10% of patients are children and adolescents. There is an increased familial risk for MG. Siblings or first-grade relatives of affected patients have a risk of 4.5% for developing MG reflecting a profound genetic disposition for the disorder.

The clinical hallmark of MG consists of fluctuating fatigability and weakness affecting ocular, bulbar and (proximal) limb skeletal muscle groups. A pragmatic clinical classification distinguishes pure ocular myasthenia from generalized myasthenia with mild, moderate and severe manifestation. Ocular myasthenia exclusively affects the outer ocular muscles including the M. levator palpebrae and presents with ptosis and double vision. Ptosis and double vision may be transient, fluctuating or progressive during the day. Only 10–20% of patients show muscle fatigability and weakness persistently restricted to the outer ocular muscles. The majority of patients proceed to generalized muscle fatigability and weakness within 24 months after the disease onset. Generalized myasthenia is defined as any clinical affection of muscle groups other than outer ocular muscles independent of its severity.

The fluctuating muscle fatigability and weakness is illustrated by a typical decremental response of the amplitude and/or area under the curve of the elicited muscle compound action potential of the fifth compared to the first stimulus upon repetitive supramaximal stimulation of the accessory or facial nerve with a frequency of 3 Hz before and after isometric tetanic contraction. The lack of an incremental response of amplitudes and areas under the curve of the compound muscle action potential upon supramaximal repetitive nerve stimulation using a frequency of 30 Hz or upon pre- and post-tetanic single stimulation proofs the post-synaptic nature of the neuromuscular transmission defect. Single fiber electromyography typically shows increased jitter and intermittent conduction blocks reflecting instable neuromuscular transmission.

5.5 Increased Reactivity to Allergens

While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of atopy or a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic challenge with such allergens. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic reactions.

5.6 Potentiation of Muscle Weakness

Beta-adrenergic blockade has been reported to potentiate muscle weakness consistent with certain myasthenic symptoms (e.g., diplopia, ptosis, and generalized weakness). Timolol has been reported rarely to increase muscle weakness in some patients with myasthenia gravis or myasthenic symptoms.

5.7 Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus

Beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be administered with caution in patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia or to diabetic patients (especially those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents may mask the signs and symptoms of acute hypoglycemia.

5.8 Masking of Thyrotoxicosis

Beta-adrenergic blocking agents may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents that might precipitate a thyroid storm.

5.9 Renal and Hepatic Impairment

Dorzolamide has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min). Because dorzolamide and its metabolite are excreted predominantly by the kidney, dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution is not recommended in such patients.

Dorzolamide has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment and should therefore be used with caution in such patients.

5.10 Impairment of Beta-Adrenergically Mediated Reflexes During Surgery

The necessity or desirability of withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents prior to major surgery is controversial. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade impairs the ability of the heart to respond to beta-adrenergically mediated reflex stimuli. This may augment the risk of general anesthesia in surgical procedures. Some patients receiving beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents have experienced protracted severe hypotension during anesthesia.

Difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has also been reported. For these reasons, in patients undergoing elective surgery, some authorities recommend gradual withdrawal of beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents.

If necessary during surgery, the effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may be reversed by sufficient doses of adrenergic agonists.

### Robotic-assisted minimally invasive thymectomy for myasthenia gravis with thymoma [^115Nc3tC]. JTCVS Techniques (2022). Medium credibility.

Representative specimens.

Central Message

The robotic approach to thymectomy using bilateral simultaneous thoracoscopy provides excellent visualization to allow safe and complete dissection around critical structures.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a chronic autoimmune disorder caused by antibodies against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. This results in skeletal muscle weakness in the ocular, respiratory, bulbar, and limb distributions. Its prevalence is approximately 250 cases per 1 million people. It is medically treated primarily with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and steroids. Immunosuppressive therapy, plasmapheresis, and/or intravenous immunoglobulin may also be indicated in advanced cases. MG may occur with or without the presence of thymoma and is a recognized paraneoplastic syndrome of thymoma affecting approximately one third of patients with thymoma. On the contrary, about 10% of patients with primary MG will have an associated thymoma, and its incidence increases with age. Primary surgery is indicated in most instances of early-stage thymoma and those cases associated with any type of MG. In the case of nonthymomatous MG, current evidence and guidelines have recently strengthened the indications for surgical over medical therapy alone in the majority of cases and recommend thymectomy for patients who have positive acetylcholine receptor antibodies, general type MG, short disease duration (< 5 years), age younger than 65 years old, and/or symptoms not controlled with medication. Before surgery, patients should generally be well-recovered from acute exacerbations of MG or crisis, minimized on their steroid dose as feasible, and should be maintained on their cholinesterase inhibitors (pyridostigmine) up to the day of surgery. If indicated for advanced cases, we prefer plasmapheresis and/or immunoglobulin therapy to have been performed within one week of surgery when feasible.

### Immunomodulators and immunosuppressants for myasthenia gravis: a network meta-analysis [^112nKTFi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Individuals with MG are typically divided into different subgroups according to the age of onset (juvenile‐onset, ≤ 18 years; early‐onset, 19 to 50 years; or late‐onset, > 50 years), the associated antibodies (including AChR, MuSK, LRP4 and seronegative), the association with thymoma (thymoma‐associated MG), and the clinical phenotype (ocular or gMG).

Approximately 70% of individuals with MG have thymic follicular hyperplasia, usually benign, which is often associated with AChR antibodies. Thymoma‐associated MG is a paraneoplastic variant of the disease, occurring in approximately 10% to 20% of patients, more frequently in those over 50. Thus, all individuals with a recent diagnosis of MG should undergo screening for thymoma. Once diagnosed, a thymectomy should be performed as soon as possible, especially in those with JMG and AChR‐positive MG, due to the higher likelihood of spontaneous remission.

Description of the intervention and how it might work

gMG treatment goals include achieving minimal symptoms or improving the patient's condition while minimising treatment side effects. Timely treatment initiation is crucial to preventing physical and psychological morbidity over the long term, particularly in JMG. Pharmacological treatment for gMG typically begins with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (such as pyridostigmine). However, as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may often be insufficient, many guidelines recommend early initiation of immunosuppressive therapy. Neurologists may initiate immunosuppression in these cases, starting with corticosteroids alone or associated with a non‐steroidal immunosuppressant (NSISTs). Additionally, in cases of insufficient response to glucocorticoids, or when aiming for corticoid sparing, addressing corticoid dependence, or managing steroid intolerance, clinicians often add NSISTs like azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil. Long‐term use of NSISTs requires close monitoring due to the risk of severe adverse events (Table 1). Moreover, thymectomy is important and indicated for all AChR‐positive MG and patients with a diagnosis of thymoma, regardless of MG status, unless a contraindication exists. In addition to pharmacological treatment, avoiding known triggers (such as certain medications, infections, and surgeries) is essential to prevent exacerbations and optimise disease control.

### Thymectomy in myasthenia gravis [^115DKyvT]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Thymectomy has long been used in the treatment of patients with myasthenia gravis and antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor. However, its effectiveness has only been proven a few years ago in a randomized controlled trial in patients under the age of 65. Here, we review the current literature focusing on patient subgroups, potential biomarkers for outcome prediction and the choice of surgical approach.

Recent Findings

Long-term follow-up studies after thymectomy confirmed that the benefits regarding clinical outcome parameters and a reduced need for immunosuppressive treatment persist. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion of patients in real-world cohorts do not reach complete stable remission after thymectomy indicating that the underlying autoimmune process is sustained in the periphery. Our understanding of the responsible mechanisms has improved with recent studies. Presently, outcome data after thymectomy in several patient subgroups, such as those aged over 50years, those with juvenile onset or those with purely ocular symptoms are limited and have been the focus of recent research activities. Similarly, biomarkers guiding an appropriate patient selection for thymectomy are under investigation. A number of cohort studies demonstrated that minimal invasive surgical techniques such as extended robotic thymectomy lead to similar positive outcomes as a transsternal approach with potentially fewer short-term adverse effects.

Summary

Thymectomy is an effective treatment option in adult patients with early onset acetylcholine-receptor positive myasthenia gravis but uncertainty remains with regard to certain patient subgroups.

### Brimonidine tartrate and timolol maleate (brimonidine tartrate / timolol maleate ophthalmic solution) [^1112hctL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Potentiation of Muscle Weakness

Beta-adrenergic blockade has been reported to potentiate muscle weakness consistent with certain myasthenic symptoms (e.g., diplopia, ptosis, and generalized weakness). Timolol has been reported rarely to increase muscle weakness in some patients with myasthenia gravis or myasthenic symptoms.

5.7 Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus

Beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be administered with caution in patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia or to diabetic patients (especially those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents may mask the signs and symptoms of acute hypoglycemia.

5.8 Masking of Thyrotoxicosis

Beta-adrenergic blocking agents may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents that might precipitate a thyroid storm.

5.9 Ocular Hypersensitivity

Ocular hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions 0.2%, with some reported to be associated with an increase in intraocular pressure [see Contraindications (4.4)].

5.10 Contamination of Topical Ophthalmic Products After Use

There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple-dose containers of topical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

5.11 Impairment of Beta-adrenergically Mediated Reflexes During Surgery

The necessity or desirability of withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents prior to major surgery is controversial. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade impairs the ability of the heart to respond to beta-adrenergically mediated reflex stimuli. This may augment the risk of general anesthesia in surgical procedures. Some patients receiving beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents have experienced protracted severe hypotension during anesthesia. Difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has also been reported. For these reasons, in patients undergoing elective surgery, some authorities recommend gradual withdrawal of beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents.

If necessary during surgery, the effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may be reversed by sufficient doses of adrenergic agonists.

### Utility and practice of electrodiagnostic testing in the pediatric population: an AANEM consensus statement [^111Ck775]. Muscle & Nerve (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric neuromuscular junction electrodiagnostics — repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS), single fiber electromyography (SFEMG), and exercise tests — use slow RNS (2 to 3 Hz) with supramaximal trains of 5 or 10 pulses comparing the first and fourth (or fifth) responses, where a CMAP decrement of > 10% is considered abnormal; at least 30–65% of children with juvenile myasthenia gravis may initially present with ocular symptoms, and RNS of the facial nerve is particularly challenging for younger children and is less likely to be performed successfully without sedation or general anesthesia; adult studies have found SFEMG to be more sensitive than RNS, and fast RNS (20 to 50 Hz) is needed to assess for facilitation/increment in presynaptic disorders (infantile botulism, presynaptic CMS, pediatric LEMS); for suspected muscle channelopathies, standardized short and long exercise tests and limb cooling can differentiate sodium or chloride channelopathy patterns, and these tests are more likely to be of value in older children and adolescents.

### Ocular myasthenia gravis: updates on an elusive target [^116rDrub]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG) is a complex condition with heterogenous phenotypes and ill-defined diagnostic criteria. Understanding concomitant risk factors and autoimmune serology can help inform prognosis for generalization and guide treatment.

Recent Findings

Although antibodies to acetylcholine receptors or muscle-specific kinase likely increase risk of generalization, they are less frequent in OMG. Patients without either antibody tend to have a milder disease process and often have variable antibodies to other end-plate proteins such as LRP4, agrin, or cortactin. The treatment of OMG begins with pyridostigmine and is supplemented by oral prednisone if treatment-resistant or high risk for generalization. Variable oral prednisone regimens have been used with success and further immunosuppression may be best achieved with mycophenolate mofetil and azathioprine. Checkpoint inhibitor-induced myasthenia gravis is increasingly recognized and likely has high rates of mortality associated with myocarditis.

Summary

Our understanding of OMG and its variable phenotypes continues to evolve. Autoantibody testing increasingly provides valuable diagnostic and prognostic information. Despite these improvements, a lack of quality treatment trials creates significant challenges for evidence-based management guidelines.

New best practice guidelines have been released in the past 2 years which address ocular and generalised MG as well as pregnancy in MG. Key points are summarised in Box 2. An important message for expectant mothers is that birth plans should aim for a hospital delivery as babies are at risk of transient neonatal MG irrespective of the mother's disease status. Therefore, home births and midwife-led units are not advised.

Thymectomy

Thymectomy in MG patients should always be performed under otherwise stable clinical conditions, i.e. following an efficient pre-treatment using GCS and other immunosuppressive measures and/or plasmapheresis/immunoadsorption or IVIG which reduces the perioperative mortality to < 1%. The clinical effect of thymectomy usually appears retrospectively after several years in an individual patient.

Thymomectomy for thymomatous MG

In case of a thymoma, indication for thymomectomy exists independent of the presence or clinical severity of accompanying MG or other autoimmune conditions.

Thymectomy for non-thymomatous AChR antibody associated MG

Given the role of the thymus in the immunopathogenesis of AchR antibody-associated MG, thymectomy has been considered a treatment option as early as 1942. However, randomized controlled trials on the efficacy of thymectomy per se and in comparison to standard immunosuppressive treatment in MG are currently not available. The results of an ongoing multi-center, single-blind, randomized phase III trial comparing extended transsternal thymectomy to no thymectomy in non-thymomatous AChR antibody associated MG patients receiving prednisone (MGTX trial) are expected for 2016.

Until the results of the MGTX trial are available, thymectomy should be considered in the following clinical situations: (a) Thymectomy may be applied in patients with non-thymomatous generalized MG for which evidence exists according to a meta-analysis. (b) Patients with non-thymomatous ocular myasthenia may undergo thymectomy based on a single case decision due to a lack of sufficient evidence from clinical trials. It is supposed that thymectomy in ocular myasthenia without thymoma might prevent generalization of myasthenic symptoms during the course of the disease.

Patients at the age of 15–50 years with generalized AchR antibody-associated MG without thymoma seem to predominantly benefit from thymectomy performed within 1–2 years after disease onset. However, these age limits are arbitrary and some experts do not consider them strict. Children and adolescents at the age of 5–14 years with AchR antibody-associated MG without thymoma are preferred to undergo thymectomy only after insufficient response to symptomatic and immunosuppressive treatment because of the role of the thymus in the development of the immune system. However, some studies indicate that thymectomy at 1.5 years of age apparently does not impair immunological function.

### Anti-MuSK myasthenia gravis presenting with purely ocular findings… [^112imkdi]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Objective To report a case of ocular myasthenia due to anti-MuSK antibodies. Patient A young woman with ocular myasthenia and antibodies to MuSK. Results Anti-MuSK antibody was detected by radioimmunoassay using highly purified MuSK recombinant antigen. Conclusion Ocular myasthenia gravis is a presentation of the anti-MuSK antibody syndrome. She denied sensory symptoms, dysphagia, dysarthria, shortness of breath, or limb weakness. Her examination revealed spontaneous and fluctuating bilateral ptosis, more prominent on the left. She had subjective diplopia despite normal extraocular movements without obvious dysconjugate gaze. She had no facial or jaw weakness and full strength throughout the neck and limbs without fatigability. On examination, she had equal bilateral ptosis covering the top third of her iris, which worsened with sustained up-gaze. Extraocular movements were normal, but cover/uncover testing revealed mild bilateral esophoria producing momentary diplopia.

There was no weakness of eye closure or neck flexion or extension. Limb strength was full bilaterally without fatigability, and the remainder of her neurologic findings were normal. Repetitive stimulation testing recording from the left nasalis with 3-Hz stimulation did not reveal a decrement at baseline or after 1 minute of exercise. Comment This report extends the clinical spectrum of anti-MuSK–positive MG to include ocular myasthenia. Our patient had purely ocular symptoms develop over several months prior to the initiation of immunosuppression, which may have affected disease progression, but she could develop generalized MG in the future. The anti-MuSK receptor antibody is directed against an extracellular portion of the muscle-membrane protein and may be pathogenic in SNMG. 2 Anti-MuSK antibodies have not been found in 38 patients with ocular MG. 3, 4, 6.

The anti-MuSK MG syndrome tends to present with 1 of 3 patterns of clinical findings: severe oculobulbar syndrome; weakness of neck, shoulder, and respiratory muscles with late ocular involvement; or a presentation indistinguishable from typical generalized MG. 4 While it is apparent that ocular MG is a less common presentation, it may now be reasonable to check for anti-MuSK antibodies in all seronegative patients regardless of the clinical presentation.

### Thymectomy in the treatment of ocular myasthenia gravis [^11689SsU]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Thymectomy is an effective and accepted treatment for myasthenia gravis, but thymectomy for ocular myasthenia gravis (Osserman stage I) is controversial.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and propriety of thymectomy for the treatment of ocular myasthenia gravis.

Methods

We conducted a review and follow-up of all patients who had thymectomy for the treatment of ocular myasthenia gravis between 1970 and 1998 at the University of California, Davis, Medical Center, and the University of Rome, "La Sapienza", Rome, Italy. Patient response to thymectomy was categorized as follows: cured, patients who became symptom-free and required no further medication; improved, patients who required less medication and whose symptoms were less severe; unchanged, patients whose symptoms and medications were the same; worse, patients who had more severe symptoms, needed more medication, or died.

Results

Sixty-one patients (mean age 37 years; range 14–73 years) were followed up for a mean duration of 9 years (range 0.5–29 years). Ocular myasthenia gravis with mixed and cortical thymomas, stages I to IV, occurred in 12 patients, and ocular myasthenia without thymomas occurred in 49 patients. Transsternal thymectomy (n = 55) and transcervical thymectomy (n = 6) resulted in cure in 31 (51%) patients, improvement in 12 (20%) patients, no change in 16 (26%) patients, and worsening of symptoms (including 1 postoperative death) in 2 patients. Patient outcomes were statistically independent of the duration of preoperative symptoms (mean 9.5 months), patient age, or the presence or absence of thymoma. In patients with ocular myasthenia, 70% were cured or improved after thymectomy; in the subgroup of patients with ocular myasthenia and thymoma, 67% were cured or improved.

Conclusion

Thymectomy is an effective and safe treatment for patients with ocular myasthenia gravis.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: 2020 update [^111sbtjP]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To update the 2016 formal consensus-based guidance for the management of myasthenia gravis (MG) based on the latest evidence in the literature.

Methods

In October 2013, the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America appointed a Task Force to develop treatment guidance for MG, and a panel of 15 international experts was convened. The RAND/UCLA appropriateness method was used to develop consensus recommendations pertaining to 7 treatment topics. In February 2019, the international panel was reconvened with the addition of one member to represent South America. All previous recommendations were reviewed for currency, and new consensus recommendations were developed on topics that required inclusion or updates based on the recent literature. Up to 3 rounds of anonymous e-mail votes were used to reach consensus, with modifications to recommendations between rounds based on the panel input. A simple majority vote (80% of panel members voting "yes") was used to approve minor changes in grammar and syntax to improve clarity.

Results

The previous recommendations for thymectomy were updated. New recommendations were developed for the use of rituximab, eculizumab, and methotrexate as well as for the following topics: early immunosuppression in ocular MG and MG associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment.

Conclusion

This updated formal consensus guidance of international MG experts, based on new evidence, provides recommendations to clinicians caring for patients with MG worldwide.

### Rapid improvement of muscle weakness post-thymectomy indicates good long-term neurological outcome in patients with ocular myasthenia gravis [^11565gud]. European Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

This study was conducted to evaluate whether post-thymectomy rapid remission of ocular myasthenia gravis (oMG) is a prognostic indicator of good long-term neurological outcome.

Methods

Eighty-four oMG patients who underwent thymectomy at our institute were enrolled. The incidence of 5-year complete stable remission (CSR) was compared between patients with rapid remission of MG status (< 1 month after surgery) and those with non-rapid remission.

Results

Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that the incidence of CSR was higher in oMG patients with rapid remission than in those without rapid remission (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that rapid remission (odds ratio 16.34, 95% confidence interval 3.58–74.60, P < 0.001) is an independent prognostic factor for CSR.

Conclusion

Postoperative rapid remission of MG status predicts a higher likelihood of complete remission in patients with oMG.

### Development of generalized disease at 2 years in patients with ocular myasthenia gravis… [^115UgVZr]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

Generalized myasthenia gravis developed within 2 years in 4 of 58 treated and 13 of 36 untreated patients. The odds ratio for development of generalized disease in the treated group was 0. 13 compared with the untreated group. abnormal serum acetylcholine receptor antibody levels in up to 50% of patients suggest that subclinical systemic disease occurs in a significant minority of patients with ocular myasthenia gravis. 2, 4 In addition, abnormal findings of single fiber electromyography of the upper extremity is more common in patients with ocular myasthenia gravis in whom generalized disease develops. 5 Limb muscle end-plate injury on ultrastructural examination has also been reported in patients with ocular myasthenia gravis.
6. For the treated group, the OR for development of generalized disease was
0. 34 compared with the untreated group.

Fifteen of the 17 patients in whom generalized myasthenia gravis developed within 2 years had the generalized form within the first half of the first year. Generalized myasthenia gravis developed in 24 patients during the entire follow-up period, including 9 in the treated group and 15 in the untreated group. Figure 1 shows the Kaplan-Meier estimate comparing the 2 groups. The log-rank statistic indicated that there was a significant difference in the rate of development of generalized myasthenia gravis in the entire study period. During the entire study period, generalized myasthenia gravis occurred in 12 of 25 patients with abnormal levels of baseline AChR antibody compared with 7 of 49 patients with a normal AChR antibody level. The log-rank statistic for the difference in generalized myasthenia gravis rates in the AChR antibody groups was also significant.

We do not believe that our findings reflect inclusion of patients with other diagnoses, since all the patients were followed up, with almost all undergoing reevaluation after at least 6 months, and most undergoing follow-up for 2 years or longer. In addition, some of these patients had progression of ocular myasthenia gravis findings and symptoms, whereas generalized myasthenia gravis developed in others.

### A combination of total intravenous anesthesia and thoracic epidural for thymectomy in juvenile myasthenia gravis [^111TTu32]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

Juvenile myasthenia gravis is the acquired form of the disease in children and presents with ocular signs, fatigability, weakness and bulbar problems. The majority of patients demonstrate thymic hyperplasia and have been shown to benefit from thymectomy. The main considerations for the anesthesiologist are the degree of muscle weakness, the muscle groups involved and sensitivity to neuromuscular blocking drugs and volatile agents. Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with epidural analgesia is probably the anesthetic technique of choice, although the latter is often avoided, because of the risk of a very high block. Two cases of thymectomy are presented where anesthesia was provided using a combination of TIVA and thoracic epidural analgesia. Both patients tolerated the technique well and had an uncomplicated perioperative course.

### Myasthenia gravis-associated neuromyelitis optica-like disease… [^1136Uqjb]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

Our inclusion criteria were a definite diagnosis of MG; the presence of significant hyperreflexia and plantar extensor responses at the least, as evidence of CNS involvement; and additional indication of NMO spectrum disease, including at least 1 of the following 3 criteria: the presence of lesions in the white matter of the brain or spinal cord; a finding of pathologically increased conduction time of the optic nerves in the VEP; or the presence of serum anti-AQP4 antibodies. Our exclusion criteria were the presence of other etiologies for signs of CNS involvement, such as cervical degenerative disease and significant cerebrovascular disease, and the presence of systemic autoimmune diseases, excluding autoimmune thyroiditis. Visual evoked potentials were recorded monocularly to pattern reversal full-field checkerboards. The latency of the major positive component was measured.

Responses were considered abnormal when the latency of the P100 was above 112 ms.
20. In 1 of the 2 patients, the result of the brain MRI was abnormal, but the lesions were interpreted as vascular and were accompanied by antiphospholipid antibodies; in both patients, the VEP was pathologic and the anti-AQP4 antibodies were negative. In addition, 5 patients were excluded because they did not fulfill the criterion of having at least 1 paraclinical indication of NMO-like disease, and 2 patients were excluded because of suspicion of significant cerebrovascular disease. A total of 15 patients constituted the final study group because they fulfilled all the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

The clinical presentation of CNS involvement included pyramidal signs in all 15 patients, pyramidal weakness in 5 patients, neurogenic sphincter disturbances in 4 patients, and visual disturbance in 1 patient. The detailed clinical and paraclinical characteristics of these 15 patients are presented in Table 2. In conclusion, our study suggests that CNS involvement in MG is much more frequent than previously acknowledged; the expression and the clinical phenotype of this involvement are highly variable and may range from a very mild pyramidal syndrome or subclinical optic tract involvement to full-blown NMO.

### Local use of dexamethasone in the treatment of ocular myasthenia gravis [^111B6qBn]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A review of the medical literature did not reveal any reports about the local used of medication in the treatment of OMG. Whether uveitis is caused by systemic disease or thyroid-related ophthalmopathy, local inflammation is a contributing factor. Local inflammation may respond to anti-inflammatory medication. Notably, myasthenia is not the direct result of inflammation but, rather, an antibody-mediated weakness. The symptoms associated with myasthenia are caused by antibody production that is not necessarily localized, so local injections of corticosteroid are not expected to reduce the production of circulating antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor. This may be the main reason why few studies published to date have investigated the administration of local treatment for MG. However, Agius maintain that OMG may be associated with ocular muscle antigen structure and/or reduced susceptibility to risk factors. Soltys et al. reported that, in autoimmune MG, the neuromuscular junctions in extraocular muscles are more susceptible to complement-mediated injury than are those of other muscles. Local factors thus appear to be a major cause of OMG. Although numerous issues remain to be elucidated, the local injection of dexamethasone appears to be an effective treatment option. The local use of dexamethasone is simple, convenient, and almost risk free.

### Surgical treatment for medically refractory myasthenic blepharoptosis [^116sxj4v]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Blepharoptosis substantially reduces the quality of life of patients with MG.–Despite multiple medical treatments, patients often experience longstanding residual blepharoptosis. In such cases, surgical treatment may play an important role. However, lack of information about the efficacy and adverse effects of blepharoptosis surgery may cause many neurologists to hesitate to inform their longstanding patients about this surgical option.

Generally, blepharoptosis surgery is not very difficult for trained surgeons, and the rate of major functional complications, such as lagophthalmos and exposure keratopathy, is usually not high. Moreover, possible complications can be effectively managed by conservative therapy or additional surgeries if necessary. Bradley et al reviewed the surgical outcome of 16 blepharoptosis procedures in ten patients with MG and concluded that blepharoptosis surgery can be an appropriate treatment option for MG refractory to medical treatment. However, the indications and specific criteria for blepharoptosis surgery in patients with MG remain unclear and should be established.

The present study presents four surgical criteria according to the specific characteristics of MG. First, the patient's general condition must be considered since clinical manifestations of MG are variable, ranging from ocular myasthenia to myasthenic crisis, in which patients experience life-threatening respiratory insufficiencies. Second, medical treatment with strict follow up must be undertaken by an attending neurologist for at least 2 years before surgery. It is reported that 50% to 60% of patients who initially present with ocular symptoms progress to develop generalized muscle weakness and that the vast majority will do so within the first 1 to 2 years of diagnosis.–Third, blepharoptosis should be consistent with minimal circadian change; otherwise, the surgical effect could collapse. Finally, the patient's quality of life should certainly be weighed, with neurologists and surgeons carefully considering a patient's quality of vision. While the criteria may vary by institute, the development of uniform criteria should be fostered.

- a rapid response to treatment is needed

- other treatments are insufficiently effective

- before initiating corticosteroids if deemed necessary to prevent or minimize exacerbations.

### Treating myasthenia gravis beyond the eye clinic [^115S8G7q]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Thymectomy

In all MG patients who have a thymoma or those who are AChR antibody positive, therapeutic thymectomy is recommended. The beneficial effect of thymectomy in older patients and antibody negative MG is not fully established, and it is generally recommended in onset of disease less than 50 years of age. Practically however, it is often used until the age of 65 if the patients are otherwise fit and healthy. Thymectomy is not recommended in MuSK-MG since there are no consistent thymic abnormalities in this sub-group.

### Risk factors of prolonged ventilation after thymectomy in thymoma myasthenia gravis patients [^1119YXKE]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Limitation

There are several limitations of this study. First, the nature of retrospective and single center study had resulted in limited power of funding out all potential confounding factors. Second, our research analyzed the data of TAMG patients over 7 years as the TAMG is not a common disease, which might lead to significant heterogeneity among the study population. Nevertheless, the main management of MG patients doesn't change during the study period in our medical center. Third, we don't have a protocol on anesthesia, the method of general and regional anesthesia, the use of muscle relaxants is all dependent on the favorite of the anesthetist. So, additional prospective, large-scale, randomized and more methodologically rigorous studies are needed. In addition, although bootstrapping technology was used as an internal validation in our study, external validation is also needed.

### Blepharoptosis surgery in patients with myasthenia gravis [^117Pq8LH]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

To review our approach of cautious surgical correction of blepharoptosis in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) to minimise risk of exposure complications.

Methods

Retrospective case note review of 30 patients with symptomatic eyelid concerns despite appropriate medical treatment, who underwent eyelid surgery. The mean age at diagnosis was 47years. 13/30 patients had systemic MG, 14/30 ocular MG and 3/30 congenital MG. The main outcome measures were improvement in eyelid height and/or position, duration of a successful postoperative result, need for further surgical intervention, and intraoperative or postoperative complications.

Results

38 blepharoptosis procedures were performed on 23 patients. Mean age at time of surgery was 62years, with an average follow-up of 29months. 10 patients (16 eyelids) underwent anterior approach levator advancement, 4 patients (5 eyelids) posterior approach surgery and 8 patients (15 eyelids) brow suspension. One patient (2 eyelids) had tarsal switch surgery. An average improvement in eyelid height of 1.9mm was achieved. Postoperative symptoms or signs of exposure keratopathy occurred in 17% of patients. This necessitated lid lowering in one eyelid of one patient. During follow-up, 37% of eyelids required further surgical intervention to improve the upper eyelid height, after an average of 19months (range 0.5–49months).

Conclusions

Over a third of patients in our series required repeat surgery, which would be expected when the initial aim was to under-correct this group. In contrast to previous commentaries, the amount of eyelid excursion was not the main factor used to guide the surgical approach.

### Extended transsternal thymectomy for the treatment of ocular myasthenia gravis [^115sHx2K]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal treatment for ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG) remains controversial. We conducted a review of the long-term clinical outcomes of Chinese patients with OMG after extended transsternal thymectomy (ETT) to determine the efficacy of this procedure as a treatment for OMG.

Methods

We reviewed the cases of 115 consecutive patients with OMG who underwent ETT at our Myasthenia Gravis Research Center between January 2006 and December 2008. Extended transsternal thymectomy was done in patients who had thymoma, resistance to pyridostigmine therapy, or relapse after immunosuppressive therapy. The patients' postoperative responses were defined as strict complete remission (SCR), consisting of an asymptomatic status without medication for more than 12 months; general complete remission (GCR), consisting of an asymptomatic status with low-dose single-drug therapy or without medication for more than 12 months; or improvement, consisting of fewer symptoms or less of a need for medication than before surgery.

Results

The overall complication rate was 7.8%. None of the patients experienced a myasthenic crisis, progression to generalized myasthenia gravis, or mortality. Hyperplasia of the thymus was present in 106 of the 115 patients (92.2%). Among 110 patients on whom follow-up was done postoperatively, 29 (26.4%) were in SCR, 64 (58.2%) showed improvement, 7 (6.4%) remained unchanged, and 10 (9.1%) had a worsening of their conditions. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed rates of GCR of 41.8% at 24 months and 47.3% at 48 months after surgery, and rates of SCR of 24.5% at 24 months and 26.4% at 48 months. Both univariate analysis and multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that only preoperative duration of illness was positively associated with GCR (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

The results of the review indicate that ETT is a safe and effective treatment for OMG, especially in patients with illness of shorter duration.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^1134pb9s]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Adult strabismus — natural history and treatment rationale indicate that onset in adults is usually in the third to fourth decade of life but sometimes much later in males, and if generalized it may involve bulbar, limb, and respiratory muscles with risk of life-threatening respiratory failure. Fifty percent of patients with myasthenia present with ocular symptoms only, and 50% to 80% of these patients develop generalized systemic myasthenia within a few years. Minimizing extraocular motility impairment, diplopia, and compensatory head position that can affect visual function, quality of life, and its socioeconomic consequences warrant treatment.

### Neuromuscular disease and anesthesia [^113NRHjj]. Muscle & Nerve (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with neuromuscular disease pose many anesthetic challenges and are at greater risk for perioperative complications, including respiratory or cardiovascular dysfunction and pulmonary aspiration. Therefore, these patients require special precautions, including interdisciplinary communication between primary care physicians, neurologists, physiatrists, surgeons, and anesthesiologists. Preoperative evaluation and optimization of comorbid conditions is critical. These patients may have adverse response to neuromuscular blocking drugs and the reversal drugs (e.g., neostigmine). They should be used with caution and titrated based on objective neuromuscular monitoring. Drugs that potentiate neuromuscular blocking drugs should also be avoided or their doses limited if possible. The risk of malignant hyperthermia in certain neuromuscular diseases mandates avoidance of triggering agents such as succinylcholine and inhaled anesthetics. Patients with neuromuscular disease may also be sensitive to sedative-hypnotics and opioids, which should be used judiciously. Finally, the postoperative period requires close monitoring due to increased risk of postoperative cardiorespiratory dysfunction.

### Thymectomy and risk of generalization in patients with ocular myasthenia gravis: a multicenter retrospective cohort study [^114C9v1M]. Neurotherapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

This study aims to investigate the association between thymectomy and the risk of generalization in patients with ocular myasthenia gravis (MG). Data on patients with ocular MG from seven neurological centers in China were retrospectively reviewed. Ocular MG naïve to immunotherapy was categorized according to whether thymectomy was performed (thymectomized group vs. nonsurgical group). Patients in the thymectomized group all underwent surgery within 2 years since ocular symptom onset. The main outcome measure was the generalization. The follow-up period was defined from the date of ocular symptom onset to the date of generalization confirmation, immunotherapy initiation, or last follow-up (defined as 60 months). Of 519 eligible patients (mean [SD] age, 48.7 [15.2] years, 46.6% women), 31 (23.7%) of 131 generalized in the thymectomized group and 122 (31.4%) of 388 did in the nonsurgical group during a median follow-up of 19 months (IQR 8.0–50.0). Thymectomy was independently associated with reduced generalization risk (adjusted HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.25–0.66, P < 0.001). Multivariable stratified analysis also verified this association across the subgroups. Kaplan-Meier curves showed that the 5-year cumulative rate was significantly lower in the thymectomized group than in the nonsurgical group. To conclude, thymectomy may be considered effective in modifying the progression from ocular to generalized MG irrespective of thymoma.

### Guidelines for treatment of autoimmune neuromuscular transmission disorders [^115bhucU]. European Journal of Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for myasthenia gravis, more specifically with respect to thymectomy, EFNS 2010 guidelines recommend to recognize that the main aim of thymectomy in patients with MG with thymoma is to treat the tumor rather than for any effect on the disease. Perform thymectomy once thymoma is diagnosed, irrespective of the severity of MG.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^113XtZ9b]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Myasthenia gravis — population, incidence, and risk factors: The patient population includes adults with myasthenia gravis without geographic or racial predilection, although this disorder occurs in children as well in the form of transient neonatal myasthenia (transplacental transmission), congenital myasthenia (not immune mediated), and juvenile autoimmune myasthenia. Patients are at risk for having or developing a thymoma. The incidence ranges from 0.04 to 5/100,000 per year, and prevalence estimates are 0.5 to 12.5/100,000 per year. There is increased risk for myasthenia gravis in the presence of autoimmune thyroid disease and thymoma.

Regarding medical management for myasthenia gravis, more specifically with respect to immunosuppressants, MGFA 2016 guidelines recommend to monitor patients for potential adverse effects and complications from immunosuppressive drugs. Consider changing to an alternative immunosuppressive agent, if adverse effects and complications are medically significant or create undue hardship for the patient.

Background

Approximately 50% of people with myasthenia gravis present with purely ocular symptoms, so called ocular myasthenia. Of these between 50% to 60% develop generalized disease, most within two years. Their management is controversial. This is an update of a review first published in 2006 and previously updated in 2008 and 2010.

Objectives

To assess the effects of treatments for ocular myasthenia and to answer three specific questions. Are there any treatments that impact the progression from ocular to generalized disease? Are there any treatments that improve symptoms of diplopia or ptosis? What is the frequency of adverse effects associated with treatments used?

Search Methods

In this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (3 August 2012), CENTRAL (2012, Issue 7), MEDLINE (January 1996 to July 2012) and EMBASE (January 1974 to July 2012) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as well as case-control and cohort studies. The titles and abstracts of all articles were read by both authors and the full texts of possibly relevant articles were reviewed. The references of all manuscripts included in the review were scanned to identify additional articles of relevance and experts in the field were contacted to identify additional published and unpublished data. Where necessary, we contacted authors for further information.

Selection Criteria

Inclusion required meeting three criteria: (a) randomized (or quasi-randomized) controlled study design; (b) active treatment compared to placebo, no treatment or some other treatment; and (c) results reported separately for patients with ocular myasthenia (grade 1) as defined by the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America.

Data Collection and Analysis

We collected data regarding the risk of progression to generalized myasthenia gravis, improvement in ocular symptoms, and the frequency of treatment-related side effects.

Main Results

In the original review, we identified two RCTs relevant to the treatment of ocular myasthenia, only one of which reported results in terms of the pre-specified outcome measures used in this review. This study included only three participants and was of limited methodological quality. There were no new RCTs in searches conducted for this or previous updates. In the absence of data from RCTs, we present a review of the available observational data.

Authors' Conclusions

The available randomized controlled literature does not permit any meaningful conclusions about the efficacy of any form of treatment for ocular myasthenia. Data from several reasonably good quality observational studies suggest that corticosteroids and azathioprine may be beneficial in reducing the risk of progression to generalized myasthenia gravis.

Ocular MG

A small RCT comparing prednisone with placebo in patients with 11 ocular MG who had previously failed to achieve minimal manifestation (MM) status after 4–6 weeks of pyridostigmine found that 5 of 6 participants (83%) in the prednisone group achieved the primary end point of sustained MM status at a median of 14 weeks on prednisone (median dose 15 mg/d), compared with none of 5 in the placebo group. Three of the 5 placebo participants switched to prednisone (60 mg/d) with rapid taper; 2 attained sustained MM status. A prospective cohort study of 13 consecutive ocular and 76 generalized MG patients evaluated the effect of IS agents on ophthalmoparesis. Fifty-nine percent of patients had complete resolution of ophthalmoparesis within 12 ± 2 months of initiation of IS agents. Patients with milder ophthalmoparesis had greater odds of symptom resolution in the first year of treatment. Median time to resolution was 7 months after IS agents were started.

Evidence for the efficacy of thymectomy in ocular MG is limited by the retrospective design of most published studies. In a case-control study of 47 patients with nonthymomatous ocular MG who underwent thymectomy matched to 67 patients who refused surgery, there was no difference in the proportion of patients achieving stable remission at a median follow-up of 100–116 months. A retrospective analysis of 236 patients with thymomatous and nonthymomatous MG reported no improvement after thymectomy in 25 patients, of whom 17 (68%) were ocular or predominantly ocular, over 12 months of follow-up. In another retrospective case series of 52 patients with MG, only 2 of 11 patients with ocular MG (18%) achieved remission after thymectomy, in contrast to 28%–50% of patients with generalized MG.
