## Question

Why someone is on metoprolol succinate instead of tartrate

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why someone might be on metoprolol succinate (extended-release) rather than metoprolol tartrate (immediate-release), and what reasoning supports that choice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic differences between the two formulations. Then, I should verify the evidence base for heart failure outcomes and guideline preferences. Next, I will consider dosing convenience and adherence. After that, I need to check special populations and safety issues, including perioperative contexts. Finally, I will synthesize scenarios where succinate is preferred and note any exceptions where tartrate might still be chosen, anchoring to FDA labeling and major society guidelines throughout [^116Wg1uK] [^1155oLjF] [^1145Vb2h].

> Let me first confirm the core pharmacologic distinction. Metoprolol succinate is an extended-release formulation designed for once-daily dosing with controlled, predictable release of metoprolol over 24 hours, whereas metoprolol tartrate is immediate-release and typically requires multiple daily doses to maintain effect, especially at lower doses where 24-hour coverage can wane [^1143MSep] [^111VWm4M] [^115rjXkV].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacokinetic implications because I need to ensure I'm not overstating this. The succinate ER formulation achieves lower peak plasma concentrations but provides more uniform beta1-blockade across the dosing interval; clinically, 50–200 mg once daily of succinate can deliver comparable or greater total 24-hour beta1-blockade than divided doses of tartrate, with less peak–trough fluctuation, which is meaningful for symptom control and physiologic stability in heart failure and angina [^11478XwY] [^111VWm4M] [^111nCzf8].

> Next, I should review the heart failure evidence, since that is the strongest driver for choosing succinate. MERIT-HF demonstrated that metoprolol succinate at a target of 200 mg once daily reduced all-cause mortality by 34% and sudden death by 41% in chronic HFrEF, establishing succinate as one of the three beta-blockers with proven mortality benefit in HFrEF alongside carvedilol and bisoprolol [^116LNxde] [^116LtvZ9]. Hold on, I should verify guideline alignment: ACC/AHA guidance explicitly recommends one of these three agents for stage C HFrEF, and contemporary performance measures operationalize "guideline-recommended beta-blocker" as bisoprolol, carvedilol, or sustained-release metoprolol succinate, reinforcing the preference for succinate over tartrate in this setting [^1155oLjF] [^116LtvZ9].

> I will now examine dosing convenience and adherence, because this often tips the scale in routine care. Once-daily succinate simplifies regimens, reduces pill burden, and mitigates end-of-dose wearing that can occur with tartrate, particularly at lower divided doses; this is especially relevant in polypharmacy and in patients with adherence challenges, and it aligns with broader hypertension quality initiatives emphasizing regimen simplification to improve control rates [^115rjXkV] [^114D5GXU]. Let me double-check that the pharmacodynamics truly support once-daily equivalence: controlled studies confirm comparable or superior total 24-hour beta1-blockade with succinate versus divided tartrate dosing, which supports the adherence advantage without sacrificing efficacy [^11478XwY].

> But wait, what about special populations and safety nuances. In renal impairment, no dose adjustment is needed for succinate, which is operationally convenient compared with agents like atenolol that require adjustment, though metoprolol tartrate also generally does not require renal dose changes; in hepatic impairment, both formulations should be started low and titrated slowly due to predominant hepatic metabolism, so formulation choice is less critical there [^113VU6pM] [^114mkPDm]. I should confirm perioperative guidance: routine initiation of high-dose beta-blockade before noncardiac surgery is discouraged due to harm signals in POISE, so if a beta-blocker is already on board, continuation is reasonable, but abrupt initiation of high-dose succinate pre-op should be avoided, which is a separate issue from chronic formulation choice [^113TJZPj] [^116Et2fY].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about interchangeability in heart failure. I initially thought tartrate might be acceptable if dosed frequently enough, but I need to check the comparative data. The COMET trial showed carvedilol outperformed metoprolol tartrate at non-equipotent doses, fueling concern that tartrate may be inferior for mortality in HFrEF; subsequent observational comparisons suggest carvedilol and metoprolol succinate have similar effectiveness in practice, reinforcing that when metoprolol is chosen for HF, it should be the succinate formulation at guideline target doses rather than tartrate [^111NPja7] [^116KbMuU]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should verify guideline language again: ACC/AHA and performance measures consistently specify sustained-release metoprolol succinate for HFrEF, not tartrate, which resolves the ambiguity in favor of succinate for chronic HF therapy [^1155oLjF] [^116LtvZ9].

> Let me consider other indications where succinate is reasonable even if not mandated. For hypertension, angina, and atrial fibrillation rate control, succinate's once-daily profile can improve adherence and smooth beta-blockade, and while beta-blockers are not first-line for uncomplicated hypertension, they are appropriate when compelling indications exist such as CAD, angina, or HF, where succinate's pharmacokinetics are advantageous for maintaining 24-hour control [^1145Vb2h] [^116Wg1uK] [^1157Hi76]. I should confirm that the pharmacodynamic data support sustained effect: yes, succinate maintains relatively stable beta1-blockade over 24 hours compared with immediate-release formulations, which is clinically useful for symptom control in angina and rate management in AF [^11478XwY].

> I need to ensure I cover scenarios where tartrate might still be preferred. In acute coronary syndromes, the IV and immediate-release oral tartrate regimen is standard early therapy for hemodynamically stable patients, with transition to oral tartrate every 6 hours and later conversion to succinate for chronic management; thus, tartrate is appropriate in the acute and early post-MI window, after which succinate is favored for long-term therapy and adherence [^115rjXkV] [^113JgdFj]. Let me verify dosing specifics: tartrate 50 mg every 6 hours for 48 hours then 100 mg twice daily is the labeled sequence, with continuation for at least 3 months and often 1–3 years, before moving to succinate if continued long term, which aligns with common practice patterns [^115rjXkV] [^113JgdFj].

> Next, I should review practical administration details that can influence formulation choice. Succinate tablets are scored and can be split to aid titration, but they should not be crushed or chewed, which preserves the extended-release kinetics; tartrate is immediate-release and can be crushed if needed, though it still requires multiple daily dosing to avoid end-of-dose attenuation, which can complicate adherence in some patients [^1138DFsN] [^116yff7M] [^115rjXkV]. I should double-check food effects: succinate's absorption is not significantly affected by food, which supports flexible morning dosing, whereas tartrate is traditionally taken with meals, a minor but practical consideration in routine care [^112jyPep] [^115rjXkV].

> Putting this together, the most defensible reasons to choose metoprolol succinate over tartrate are: proven mortality benefit and guideline endorsement in HFrEF with a once-daily, adherence-friendly regimen; smoother 24-hour beta1-blockade that better matches chronic disease physiology; fewer end-of-dose fluctuations; and fewer renal or food-related administration constraints, all of which support better real-world persistence and dose attainment to targets shown to improve outcomes [^116LNxde] [^1155oLjF] [^11478XwY] [^113VU6pM]. Tartrate remains appropriate in acute settings and during early post-MI titration, with a planned transition to succinate for chronic therapy when feasible, which balances acute efficacy with long-term adherence and outcome benefits [^115rjXkV] [^113JgdFj].

---

Patients are typically prescribed **metoprolol succinate** because its once-daily, extended-release formulation improves adherence and provides steady 24-hour beta-blockade [^11478XwY], which is especially beneficial for chronic conditions like heart failure [^116LNxde], hypertension, and angina [^116Wg1uK]. In heart failure, metoprolol succinate is preferred because it has **proven mortality benefit** in large trials [^116LNxde] and is guideline-endorsed [^1155oLjF] for HFrEF [^116LtvZ9]. Metoprolol tartrate is reserved for acute settings or when rapid titration is needed, such as post–myocardial infarction [^115rjXkV] or arrhythmia management [^115LQuHt], due to its shorter half-life and more frequent dosing [^115uPp7b].

## Pharmacological differences between metoprolol succinate and tartrate

Metoprolol succinate and tartrate differ in **formulation, pharmacokinetics, and clinical applications**:

| **Feature** | **Metoprolol succinate** | **Metoprolol tartrate** |
|-|-|-|
| Formulation | Extended-release (ER) | Immediate-release (IR) |
| Half-life | Longer, allowing once-daily dosing | Shorter, requiring multiple daily doses |
| Clinical use | Chronic management of hypertension, angina, and heart failure | Acute settings, rapid titration, post-MI care |

---

## Clinical indications and guidelines

### Heart failure

Metoprolol succinate is **strongly recommended** for chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) [^1155oLjF] because it reduces mortality and hospitalizations [^116LNxde]; the MERIT-HF trial showed a 34% reduction in all-cause mortality. In contrast, metoprolol tartrate is **not preferred** for chronic heart failure management because of its shorter half-life and lack of evidence for the same mortality benefit.

---

### Hypertension and angina

Metoprolol succinate is **preferred** for chronic hypertension and angina because its once-daily dosing improves adherence and provides consistent blood pressure control [^111nCzf8]. Metoprolol tartrate is **used** when rapid dose adjustment is needed or in acute care settings.

---

### Post-myocardial infarction (MI)

Metoprolol tartrate is **preferred** in the acute post-MI setting for rapid titration and short-term management [^115rjXkV]. Metoprolol succinate may be used in the **chronic phase** post-MI for ongoing cardiovascular protection.

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing choice

Several **patient-specific factors** influence the choice between metoprolol succinate and tartrate:

- **Adherence**: Once-daily succinate improves adherence compared with multiple daily tartrate doses [^notfound].
- **Comorbidities**: Succinate is preferred in chronic heart failure, hypertension, and angina.
- **Acute settings**: Tartrate is preferred for rapid titration in acute MI or arrhythmias [^111uD5YX].

---

## Clinical outcomes and safety profiles

### Metoprolol succinate

Key benefits include **improved adherence** with once-daily dosing [^114D5GXU] and **proven mortality reduction** in HFrEF [^116LNxde]. Potential limitations include a higher risk of bradycardia and hypotension, especially at higher doses [^114CgVDb].

---

### Metoprolol tartrate

Key benefits include **rapid titration** and flexibility in acute settings [^115rjXkV]. Potential limitations include reduced adherence with multiple daily doses and less consistent beta-blockade over 24 hours [^116LNxde].

---

## Summary of reasons for prescribing metoprolol succinate

Patients are prescribed **metoprolol succinate** primarily for the following reasons:

- **Adherence**: Once-daily dosing improves adherence [^notfound].
- **Heart failure**: Proven mortality benefit in HFrEF [^116LNxde].
- **Chronic conditions**: Preferred for chronic hypertension and angina [^notfound].
- **Steady control**: Provides consistent 24-hour beta-blockade [^11478XwY].

2.1 Hypertension

Individualize the dosage of Metoprolol tartrate tablets. Metoprolol tartrate tablets should be taken with or immediately following meals.

The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily in single or divided doses. Adjust dosage at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved. In general, the maximum effect of any given dosage level will be apparent after 1 week of therapy. The effective dosage range of Metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 mg to 450 mg per day. Dosages above 450 mg per day have not been studied. While once-daily dosing can maintain a reduction in blood pressure throughout the day, lower doses (especially 100 mg) may not maintain a full effect at the end of the 24-hour period. Larger or more frequent daily doses may be required. Measure blood pressure near the end of the dosing interval to determine whether satisfactory control is being maintained throughout the day.

2.2 Angina Pectoris

The dosage of Metoprolol tartrate tablets should be individualized. Metoprolol tartrate tablets should be taken with or immediately following meals.

The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily, given in two divided doses. Gradually increase the dosage at weekly intervals until optimum clinical response has been obtained or there is a pronounced slowing of the heart rate. The effective dosage range of Metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 to 400 mg per day. Dosages above 400 mg per day have not been studied. If treatment is to be discontinued, reduce the dosage gradually over a period of 1–2 weeks [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

2.3 Myocardial Infarction

See prescribing information of intravenous metoprolol for dosage instructions for intravenous therapy.

In patients who tolerate the full intravenous dose, initiate Metoprolol tartrate tablets, 50 mg every 6 hours, 15 minutes after the last intravenous dose of metoprolol and continue for 48 hours. In the case of intolerance, reduce dose to 25 mg and administer for 48 hours. Titrate, based on tolerability, to a maintenance dosage of 100 mg twice daily. Continue therapy for at least 3 months. Although the efficacy of Metoprolol tartrate beyond 3 months has not been conclusively established, data from studies with other beta-blockers suggest that treatment should be continued for 1 to 3 years.

### Meta-analysis of the effects of carvedilol versus metoprolol on all-cause mortality and hospitalizations in patients with heart failure [^111NPja7]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Long-term treatment with appropriate doses of carvedilol or metoprolol is currently recommended for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) to decrease the risk of death, hospitalizations, and patients' symptoms. It remains unclear if the β blockers used in patients with HFrEF are equal or carvedilol is superior to metoprolol types. We performed a meta-analysis of the comparative effects of carvedilol versus metoprolol tartrate and succinate on all-cause mortality and/or hospitalization. We conducted an Embase and MEDLINE search for prospective controlled trials and cohort studies of patients with HFrEF who were received to treatment with carvedilol versus metoprolol. We identified 4 prospective controlled and 6 cohort studies with 30,943 patients who received carvedilol and 69,925 patients on metoprolol types (tartrate and succinate) with an average follow-up duration of 36.4 months. All-cause mortality was reduced in prospective studies with carvedilol versus metoprolol tartrate. Neither all-cause mortality nor hospitalizations were significantly different between carvedilol and metoprolol succinate in the cohort studies. In conclusion, in patients with HFrEF, carvedilol and metoprolol succinate have similar effects in reducing all-cause mortality.

Myocardial Infarction

Early Treatment:

During the early phase of definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction, initiate treatment with metoprolol tartrate as soon as possible after the patient's arrival in the hospital. Such treatment should be initiated in a coronary care or similar unit immediately after the patient's hemodynamic condition has stabilized.

Begin treatment in this early phase with the intravenous administration of three bolus injections of 5 mg of metoprolol tartrate each; give the injections at approximately 2-minute intervals. During the intravenous administration of metoprolol tartrate, monitor blood pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiogram.

In patients who tolerate the full intravenous dose (15 mg), initiate metoprolol tartrate tablets, 50 mg every 6 hours, 15 minutes after the last intravenous dose and continue for 48 hours. Thereafter, the maintenance dosage is 100 mg twice daily (see Late Treatment below).

Start patients who appear not to tolerate the full intravenous dose on metoprolol tartrate tablets either 25 mg or 50 mg every 6 hours (depending on the degree of intolerance) 15 minutes after the last intravenous dose or as soon as their clinical condition allows. In patients with severe intolerance, discontinue metoprolol tartrate (see WARNINGS).

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Chronic heart failure — beta-blockers with proven mortality benefit and agent selection is summarized as follows: Three beta-blockers have been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of death in patients with chronic heart failure (HF): bisoprolol, sustained-release metoprolol (succinate), and carvedilol; positive findings with these 3 agents should not be considered a class effect, and patients who have Stage C HF should be treated with 1 of these 3 beta-blockers. In one head-to-head trial, carvedilol (target dose 25 mg twice daily) versus immediate-release metoprolol tartrate (target dose 50 mg twice daily) was associated with a significantly reduced mortality, and there have been no trials to explore whether the survival benefits of carvedilol are greater than those of sustained-release metoprolol when both are used at the target doses.

### Metoprolol succinate er tablets (metoprolol succinate) [^116Wg1uK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Hypertension

Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including metoprolol.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

1.2 Angina Pectoris

Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are indicated in the long-term treatment of angina pectoris, to reduce angina attacks and to improve exercise tolerance.

1.3 Heart Failure

Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality and heart-failure hospitalization in patients with heart failure.

### Carvedilol compared with metoprolol succinate in the treatment and prognosis of patients with stable chronic heart failure: carvedilol or metoprolol evaluation study [^1122CZqt]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Background

β-Blockers exert a prognostic benefit in the treatment of chronic heart failure. Their pharmacological properties vary. The only substantial comparative trial to date-the Carvedilol or Metoprolol European Trial-has compared carvedilol with short-acting metoprolol tartrate at different dose equivalents. We therefore addressed the relative efficacy of equal doses of carvedilol and metoprolol succinate on survival in multicenter hospital outpatients with chronic heart failure.

Methods and Results

Four thousand sixteen patients with stable systolic chronic heart failure who were using either carvedilol or metoprolol succinate were identified in the Norwegian Heart Failure Registry and The Heart Failure Registry of the University of Heidelberg, Germany. Patients were individually matched on both the dose equivalents and the respective propensity scores for β-blocker treatment. During a follow-up for 17 672 patient-years, it was found that 304 (27.2%) patients died in the carvedilol group and 1066 (36.8%) in the metoprolol group. In a univariable analysis of the general sample, metoprolol therapy was associated with higher mortality compared with carvedilol therapy (hazard ratio, 1.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–1.69; P < 0.001). This difference was not seen after multivariable adjustment (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.57–1.50; P = 0.75) and adjustment for propensity score and dose equivalents (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.94–1.20; P = 0.36) or in the propensity and dose equivalent-matched sample (hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.82–1.23; P = 0.99). These results were essentially unchanged for all prespecified subgroups.

Conclusions

In outpatients with chronic heart failure, no conclusive association between all-cause mortality and treatment with carvedilol or metoprolol succinate was observed after either multivariable adjustment or multilevel propensity score matching.

2.3 Heart Failure

Dosage must be individualized and closely monitored during up-titration. Prior to initiation of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, stabilize the dose of other heart failure drug therapy. The recommended starting dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablet is 25 mg once daily for two weeks in patients with NYHA Class II heart failure and 12.5 mg once daily in patients with more severe heart failure. Double the dose every two weeks to the highest dosage level tolerated by the patient or up to 200 mg of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets. Initial difficulty with titration should not preclude later attempts to introduce metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets. If patients experience symptomatic bradycardia, reduce the dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets. If transient worsening of heart failure occurs, consider treating with increased doses of diuretics, lowering the dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets or temporarily discontinuing it. The dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets should not be increased until symptoms of worsening heart failure have been stabilized.

2.4 Administration

Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are scored and can be divided; however, do not crush or chew the whole or half tablet.

### Endothelial function is unaffected by changing between carvedilol and metoprolol in patients with heart failure – a randomized study [^116Q5pH2]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

Different groups of beta blockers might have different effects on blood pressure and heart rate. We therefore did a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate measurement in a subgroup of patients from all three treatment groups. When testing the patients on first carvedilol treatment, since treatment with either metoprolol tartrate or metoprolol succinate, we found no difference between the beta blocker treatment groups. In a study by Sanderson a 24-hour heart rate evaluation was done in patients with HF; they compared treatment with carvedilol and metoprolol tartrate and found no difference in diurnal heart rate. In our study we examined groups treated with either metoprolol tartrate or metoprolol succinate at comparable doses and found no changes in either diurnal blood pressure or heart rate. This indicates that metoprolol tartrate instead of metoprolol succinate did not cause a different effect of beta1-adrenergic blockade at doses chosen in our study. In a direct comparison among patients with HF, no differences in hemodynamic parameters were found either between treatments with metoprolol tartrate or metoprolol succinate at equal doses.

Study Limitation

Our patients were already treated with carvedilol at the first examination of endothelial function. Methodologically, it would have been an advantage to the study if patients were beta blocker naïve at entering the study. We found it unethical to withdraw beta blocker treatment in patients with a proven benefit of treatment and risk of worsening of heart failure symptoms in the situation of withdrawal of beta blocker treatment.

A limitation to the study could be the relative small number of patients included. With 9 patients in each group we were not able to show any difference in endothelial function between different beta blocker treatments. The fact that we did not find any difference in endothelial function could be explained by the short treatment period and a risk of a carry over effect.

### Antihypertensive medication regimens used by US adults with hypertension and the potential for fixed-dose combination products: the national health and nutrition examination surveys 2015 to 2020 [^114D5GXU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

The BP goal of < 130/80 mm Hg recommended by the US guidelines for most US adults with hypertension will not be achieved without improvements in how antihypertensive medications are prescribed and used. In the current study, only 52.6% of US adults with hypertension taking ≥ 2 antihypertensive medications had a measured BP below this threshold. Improving the rate of medication intensification (ie, avoiding therapeutic inertia) may be the most important factor to improve BP control rates.FDC products are one method to prevent therapeutic inertia and improve medication adherence, yet no qualitative studies have explored why FDC use is low in current practice, which is surely related to reasons beyond simple availability (eg, cost and titration difficulties). Such qualitative research may isolate if any clinician‐specific hesitations exist to using FDCs and investigate how clinicians choose to prescribe class combinations or specific medications. Further research on longitudinal treatment patterns in patients with hypertension may shed light on the appropriateness or inappropriateness of regimens and how to encourage the use of evidence‐based therapy across the treatment continuum.

The current study's strengths include robust medication data collection among participants representative of the US population. NHANES is payer agnostic, reflecting real‐world medication use and practice patterns irrespective of care delivery model. Results may differ among specific populations by age or insurance type (eg, integrated care delivery systems). The study is limited in that medication dose is unavailable in NHANES, and we could not differentiate between use of FDCs with metoprolol tartrate versus succinate. Furthermore, as the current study is cross‐sectional, we cannot determine the regimen appropriateness for each participant. This study's results are dependent on the assumption that the entire regimen had to be available as 1 FDC. It is possible that results would differ if the regimen could be achieved through ≥ 2 FDCs, although based on the infrequent use (< 0.5%) of 1 of the commercially available FDCs in the current analysis and lack of comprehensive FDCs with β‐blockers and CCB classes, we do not anticipate materially different results if this assumption were relaxed. Finally, some regimens and FDC products are favorable over others because of preferred class combinations or formulation as once‐daily dosing frequencies, but this was beyond the scope of our current analysis.

5.1 Abrupt Cessation of Therapy

Following abrupt cessation of therapy with certain beta-blocking agents, exacerbations of angina pectoris and, in some cases, myocardial infarction have occurred. When discontinuing chronically administered metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, gradually reduce the dosage over a period of 1 to 2 weeks and monitor the patient. If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary ischemia develops, promptly reinstate metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, and take measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina. Warn patients not to interrupt therapy without their physician's advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, avoid abruptly discontinuing metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets in patients treated only for hypertension.

5.2 Heart Failure

Worsening cardiac failure may occur during up-titration of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets. If such symptoms occur, increase diuretics and restore clinical stability before advancing the dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. It may be necessary to lower the dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets or temporarily discontinue it. Such episodes do not preclude subsequent successful titration of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets.

5.3 Bronchospastic Disease

Patients with bronchospastic diseases should, in general, not receive beta-blockers. Because of its relative beta1-cardio-selectivity, however, metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets may be used in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, other antihypertensive treatment. Because beta1-selectivity is not absolute, use the lowest possible dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets. Bronchodilators, including beta2-agonists, should be readily available or administered concomitantly [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

5.4 Bradycardia

Bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, and cardiac arrest have occurred with the use of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets. Patients with first-degree atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, conduction disorders (including Wolff-Parkinson-White) or on concomitant drugs that cause bradycardia [see Drug Interactions (7.3)], may be at increased risk. Monitor heart rate in patients receiving metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets. If severe bradycardia develops, reduce or stop metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets.

### Metoprolol succinate er tablets (metoprolol succinate) [^116yff7M]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 Heart Failure

Dosage must be individualized and closely monitored during up-titration. Prior to initiation of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, stabilize the dose of other heart failure drug therapy. The recommended starting dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are 25 mg once daily for two weeks in patients with NYHA Class II heart failure and 12.5 mg once daily in patients with more severe heart failure. Double the dose every two weeks to the highest dosage level tolerated by the patient or up to 200 mg of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets.

Initial difficulty with titration should not preclude later attempts to introduce metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets. If patients experience symptomatic bradycardia, reduce the dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets. If transient worsening of heart failure occurs, consider treating with increased doses of diuretics, lowering the dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, or temporarily discontinuing it. The dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets should not be increased until symptoms of worsening heart failure have been stabilized.

2.4 Administration

Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are scored and can be divided; however, do not crush or chew the whole or half tablet.

### Endothelial function is unaffected by changing between carvedilol and metoprolol in patients with heart failure – a randomized study [^115VsESQ]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Beta blocker treatment is a well-established therapy for heart failure (HF), but the drugs tested have different profiles of possible clinical consequence. In the Carvedilol Or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET) treatment with carvedilol was found superior in patients with chronic heart failure when compared to metoprolol tartrate.

Patients with heart failure are characterized by having an impaired endothelial function regardless of the etiology of heart failure. An impaired endothelial function in patients with heart failure is associated with a poor prognosis and the severity of endothelial function in HF is proportional to the New York Heart Association heart failure classification (NYHA) in HF. We therefore designed this study to investigate whether metoprolol tartrate, metoprolol succinate and carvedilol respectively affect vascular endothelial function and vascular insulin resistance differently in patients with chronic heart failure.

Patients with HF are at increased risk of developing diabetes and frequently demonstrate insulin resistance. In the Carvedilol Or Metoprolol European Trial (Comet) study it was observed that metoprolol deteriorates metabolic glucose control whereas carvedilol does not and, accordingly, there was a larger number of new-onset diabetes in patients treated with metoprolol. We have observed that vascular insulin sensitivity was deteriorated after treatment with metoprolol in patients with type 2 diabetes, whereas no change was found after treatment with carvedilol. We hypothesized that changes in endothelial insulin sensitivity might be involved in the processes by which survival is different during treatment with carvedilol and metoprolol.

The beta-1 adrenergic receptor blocking effect of metoprolol tartrate has been doubted to be as effective as the beta-1 adrenergic blocking effect of both carvedilol and metoprolol succinate. We therefore performed a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement as well as heart rate measurements in patients receiving either carvedilol, metoprolol tartrate or metoprolol succinate to evaluate potential differences in the adrenergic effects among three treatment groups. We aimed to find potential differences among beta blockers, when used in recommended doses, to obtain what is thought to be equivalent treatment doses.

### A comparison of anti-arrhythmic efficacy of carvedilol vs metoprolol succinate in patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators [^115SniH9]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

The anti‐arrhythmic superiority of carvedilol to metoprolol has been demonstrated in some clinical situations. In a meta‐analysis, carvedilol was superior to metoprolol (tartrate) in reducing the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery 14; however, little data exists to support the use of one medication over the other in prevention of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with reduced LV ejection fraction. The efficacy of carvedilol in reducing appropriate ICD therapies was previously demonstrated in a post hoc analysis of the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial with Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy. 15 In this post hoc analysis, carvedilol was associated with a reduction in incidence of ventricular arrhythmias which barely reached statistical significance (0.80 [95% CI: 0.63 to 1.00], P = 0.05) compared with metoprolol. However, 12% in the metoprolol arm used the tartrate preparation which is known to be inferior to carvedilol. 16 In addition, there were significant baseline differences (lesser number of ischemic CM in carvedilol group) which may have affected the outcome. In the current study, there was no significant difference in baseline parameters between carvedilol and metoprolol succinate and patients on metoprolol tartrate were excluded.

In the present study, carvedilol was not associated with a reduction in inappropriate ICD therapy for supraventricular tachyarrhythmias compared to metoprolol succinate. This can be explained by the fact that in clinically used doses, the effects of carvedilol and metoprolol on the atrioventricular node are similar which may result in reduced ventricular rate response in patients with supraventricular arrhythmias. 17, 18, 19 The results of this study differ from a prior post hoc analysis of the MADIT CRT study which showed that carvedilol was superior to metoprolol in reducing inappropriate ICD therapies. 20 The present study included patients with both CRT and non‐CRT devices and may have been underpowered to detect a significant difference.

### Endothelial function is unaffected by changing between carvedilol and metoprolol in patients with heart failure – a randomized study [^11316tKt]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Carvedilol has been shown to be superior to metoprolol tartrate to improve clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF), yet the mechanisms responsible for these differences remain unclear. We examined if there were differences in endothelial function, insulin stimulated endothelial function, 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate during treatment with carvedilol, metoprolol tartrate and metoprolol succinate in patients with HF.

Methods

Twenty-seven patients with mild HF, all initially treated with carvedilol, were randomized to a two-month treatment with carvedilol, metoprolol tartrate or metoprolol succinate. Venous occlusion plethysmography, 24-hour blood pressure and heart rate measurements were done before and after a two-month treatment period.

Results

Endothelium-dependent vasodilatation was not affected by changing from carvedilol to either metoprolol tartrate or metoprolol succinate. The relative forearm blood flow at the highest dose of serotonin was 2.42 ± 0.33 in the carvedilol group at baseline and 2.14 ± 0.24 after two months continuation of carvedilol (P = 0.34); 2.57 ± 0.33 before metoprolol tartrate treatment and 2.42 ± 0.55 after treatment (p = 0.74) and in the metoprolol succinate group 1.82 ± 0.29 and 2.10 ± 0.37 before and after treatment, respectively (p = 0.27). Diurnal blood pressures as well as heart rate were also unchanged by changing from carvedilol to metoprolol tartrate or metoprolol succinate.

Conclusion

Endothelial function remained unchanged when switching the beta blocker treatment from carvedilol to either metoprolol tartrate or metoprolol succinate in this study, where blood pressure and heart rate also remained unchanged in patients with mild HF.

### Long-term mortality associated with use of carvedilol versus metoprolol in heart failure patients with and without type 2 diabetes: a Danish nationwide cohort study [^117X7JiL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

The use of β‐blockers have been shown to significantly reduce the mortality risk in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Specifically, the use of bisoprolol, carvedilol, and metoprolol have proven mortality benefit (versus placebo) in several large clinical trials over the years. Furthermore, while these 3 agents have generally been shown to be equivalent in observational studies, a randomized clinical trial (COMET [Carvedilol Or Metoprolol European Trial]) comparing metoprolol tartrate 50 mg BID to carvedilol 25 mg BID suggested superiority of carvedilol. However, target dosages have been criticized for not being equipotent and differ from normal clinical practice (where metoprolol succinate is used at a target dose of 200 mg daily).

Carvedilol has been shown to have a better glycemic profile than metoprolol in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and hypertension, but it is not known if this difference is clinically important in patients with HFrEF. A secondary analysis of the COMET trial suggested that patients with HFrEF randomized to carvedilol had lower incidence of new‐onset diabetes compared with patients randomized to metoprolol. However, those with T2D had similar reductions in mortality with carvedilol treatment versus metoprolol treatment as non‐diabetic patients, suggesting that the metabolic advantages of carvedilol may not translate into additional mortality benefit in T2D.

Given the high prevalence of T2D among patients with HFrEF, the adverse outcomes associated with T2D in HFrEF, and the potential of carvedilol to mitigate some of the metabolic abnormalities in T2D, studies addressing the mortality associated with carvedilol versus metoprolol in people with T2D and HFrEF are warranted. We sought to compare mortality in patients with HFrEF and T2D taking carvedilol with those taking metoprolol (the 2 most commonly used β‐blockers in HF treatment), and to investigate potential differences in treatment effects associated with carvedilol between patients with and without T2D in a real‐world cohort of patients with new‐onset HFrEF. Additionally, we analyzed the risk of developing new‐onset T2D during follow‐up according to carvedilol versus metoprolol use in the sample free from T2D at baseline to investigate if carvedilol may have clinically beneficial effects on glucose‐metabolism in real life.

### Endothelial function is unaffected by changing between carvedilol and metoprolol in patients with heart failure – a randomized study [^112rXFQS]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

Design

Before randomization all patients were treated with carvedilol for at period of at least two months to ensure equal use of beta blockers at baseline. Patients receiving beta blocker treatment at the time they were included in the study, had their beta blocker treatment changed to carvedilol. If the patients were beta blocker naïve at the time of inclusion, they started treatment with carvedilol and titrated to the highest tolerable dose. The patients were then randomized to receive treatment with carvedilol, metoprolol tartrate or metoprolol succinate for a period of two months. The group of patients who continued on carvedilol treatment served as time-control. Patients were otherwise kept on their usual medication throughout the whole study period.

Ten patients were randomized to receive carvedilol with a target dose of 50 mg a day; ten patients were randomized to receive metoprolol succinate with a target dose of 200 mg a day and ten patients were randomized to receive metoprolol tartrate with a target dose of 200 mg a day.

The study was designed as an open parallel group study. Before and after the two months randomization period an examination of endothelial function as well as insulin stimulated endothelial function was performed by venous occlusion plethysmography as described in the following section. Forearm glucose uptake was measured during intra-arterial insulin infusion both before and after the treatment period. 24 hour blood pressure and heart rate measurements were also done before and after the two months randomization period.

### Endothelial function is unaffected by changing between carvedilol and metoprolol in patients with heart failure – a randomized study [^113dcBmA]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

Results

Both men and women were included in the study and they were at the age 46 to 80 years old at the time the study took place. Three patients were excluded from the study after randomization, one in each treatment group. Two patients were excluded due to difficulties in cannulation at the second examination day and one patient was excluded because of an episode of unstable angina during the treatment period. Therefore nine patients in each treatment group completed the study.

The carvedilol doses achieved at baseline were similar in the three groups: 37.2 ± 5.3 mg a day in the group that was randomized to continue on carvedilol, 36.8 ± 5.6 mg a day in the group that was switched to metoprolol succinate treatment and 34.0 ± 6.5 mg a day in the group that was switched to metoprolol tartrate. After randomization and through the two-month treatment period, the doses of the respective treatments were as follows: 37.2 ± 5.3 mg a day of carvedilol, 147.2 ± 22.2 mg of metoprolol succinate and 130.6 ± 24.9 mg a day of metoprolol tartrate.

Baseline data and changes after the two-month treatment period are shown in table 1 for all three treatment groups as well as baseline data for the healthy control group. Nine, seven and four patients in the carvedilol, metoprolol succinate and metoprolol tartrate group respectively, received either an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (AT II antagonist). The use of statins as well as aspirin was equal in all three treatment groups. After initial screening, patients who were using other beta blockers than carvedilol were changed to carvedilol and those who where not using any, were initiated to treatment with carvedilol and titrated to the highest tolerable dose.

Excretion

Approximately 95% of the dose can be recovered in urine. In most subjects (extensive metabolizers), less than 5% of an oral dose and less than 10% of an intravenous dose are excreted as unchanged drug in the urine. In poor metabolizers, up to 30% or 40% of oral or intravenous doses, respectively, may be excreted unchanged; the rest is excreted by the kidneys as metabolites that appear to have no beta-blocking activity. The renal clearance of the stereo-isomers does not exhibit stereo-selectivity in renal excretion.

Specific populations

Geriatric patients: The geriatric population may show slightly higher plasma concentrations of metoprolol as a combined result of a decreased metabolism of the drug in elderly population and a decreased hepatic blood flow. However, this increase is not clinically significant or therapeutically relevant.

Renal impairment: The systemic availability and half-life of metoprolol tartrate in patients with renal failure do not differ to a clinically significant degree from those in normal subjects.

Hepatic Impairment: Since the drug is primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism, hepatic impairment may impact the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol.

Drug Interactions

Metoprolol is metabolized predominantly by CYP2D6. In healthy subjects with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer phenotype, coadministration of quinidine 100 mg, a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, and immediate-release metoprolol 200 mg tripled the concentration of S-metoprolol and doubled the metoprolol elimination half-life. In four patients with cardiovascular disease, coadministration of propafenone 150 mg t.i.d. with immediate-release metoprolol 50 mg t.i.d. increased the steady-state metoprolol concentration 2-to 5-fold compared to metoprolol alone. Extensive metabolizers who concomitantly use CYP2D6 inhibiting drugs will have increased (several-fold) metoprolol blood levels, decreasing metoprolol's cardioselectivity [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

12.5 Pharmacogenomics

CYP2D6 is absent in about 8% of Caucasians (poor metabolizers) and about 2% of most other populations. CYP2D6 can be inhibited by several drugs. Poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 will have increased (several-fold) metoprolol blood levels, decreasing metoprolol's cardioselectivity.

In our study we found no changes in vascular reactivity in patients with mild HF by changing treatment from carvedilol to metoprolol tartrate or metoprolol succinate. Previous studies with metabolic advantages of carvedilol compared to metoprolol were not reflected in our study of forearm glucose uptake; no changes were seen between carvedilol or metoprolol treatment.

2.1 Hypertension

Adults: The usual initial dosage is 25 mg to 100 mg daily in a single dose. Adjust dosage at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved. In general, the maximum effect of any given dosage level will be apparent after 1 week of therapy. Dosages above 400 mg per day have not been studied.

Pediatric Hypertensive Patients ≥ 6 Years of age: The recommended starting dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are 1 mg/kg once daily, but the maximum initial dose should not exceed 50 mg once daily. Adjust dosage according to blood pressure response. Doses above 2 mg/kg (or in excess of 200 mg) once daily have not been studied in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets have not been studied in pediatric patients < 6 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

2.2 Angina Pectoris

Individualize the dosage of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets. The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily, given in a single dose. Gradually increase the dosage at weekly intervals until optimum clinical response has been obtained or there is a pronounced slowing of the heart rate. Dosages above 400 mg per day have not been studied. If treatment is to be discontinued, reduce the dosage gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.

Hypertension and Angina: Most adverse reactions have been mild and transient. The most common (> 2%) adverse reactions are tiredness, dizziness, depression, diarrhea, shortness of breath, bradycardia, and rash.

Heart Failure: In the MERIT-HF study comparing metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets in daily doses up to 200 mg (mean dose 159 mg once-daily; n = 1,990) to placebo (n = 2,001), 10.3% of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets patients discontinued for adverse reactions vs. 12.2% of placebo patients.

The table below lists adverse reactions in the MERIT-HF study that occurred at an incidence of ≥ 1% in the metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets group and greater than placebo by more than 0.5%, regardless of the assessment of causality.

Adverse Reactions Occurring in the MERIT-HF Study at an Incidence ≥ 1% in the Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets Group and Greater Than Placebo by More Than 0.5%

Post-operative Adverse Events: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8,351 patients with or at risk for atherosclerotic disease undergoing non-vascular surgery and who were not taking beta–blocker therapy, metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets 100 mg was started 2 to 4 hours prior to surgery then continued for 30 days at 200 mg per day. Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets use was associated with a higher incidence of bradycardia (6.6% vs. 2.4%; HR 2.74; 95% CI 2.19, 3.43), hypotension (15% vs. 9.7%; HR 1.55; 95% CI 1.37, 1.74), stroke (1.0% vs. 0.5%; HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.26, 3.74) and death (3.1% vs. 2.3%; HR 1.33; 95% CI 1.03, 1.74) compared to placebo.

Discussion

In this study we examined vascular and hemodynamic effects of changing beta blocker treatment from carvedilol to metoprolol succinate or metoprolol tartrate in patients with documented heart failure. In our study, endothelial function was not changed from switching beta blocker treatment from carvedilol to either metoprolol succinate or metoprolol tartrate. Previous studies have indicated that treatment with carvedilol could improve endothelial function in patients with coronary artery disease and in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Studies have shown that endothelial function is associated with NYHA class. In our study all patients were stable with mild heart failure NYHA I-II, also after changing treatment with beta blockers. This fact that patients had mild HF, could have influenced the fact that we were not able to demonstrate a change in endothelial function after switching the beta blocker treatment from carvedilol to metoprolol, neither the succinate or tartrate formulation (Figure 2). Most patients in this study were treated with both statins as well as ACE inhibitors or AT II antagonists known to improve endothelial function in patients with heart failure. The fact that we were not able to demonstrate an impaired endothelial function in patients with HF, could be explained by the concomitant medication, known to improve endothelial function. The concomitant medication could impact endothelial function throughout the study period and influence the fact that we were not able to demonstrate a difference in endothelial function after changing beta blocker treatment from carvedilol to metoprolol. Also the fact that co-existence of diabetes is associated with blunted endothelial function might have influenced the results of our study. In the group of patients randomized to a treatment with either carvedilol or metoprolol succinate there were three patients with co-existing diabetes in each group, whereas there were no patients with diabetes in the group randomized to a treatment with metoprolol tartrate. Even though, we found no change after multivariable analysis including co-existence of diabetes.

¹p < 0.05 for comparison between metoprolol tartrate and carvedilol

2 p < 0.05 for comparison between metoprolol tartrate and metoprolol succinate

3 p < 0.05 change from before and after randomization treatment

Before randomization, patients in the metoprolol tartrate group had a lower fasting glucose and HgbA1c than the other treatment groups (p < 0.05) (table 1). This could be explained by the fact that there were three patients with type 2 diabetes included in the carvedilol as well as the metoprolol succinate group and none in the metoprolol tartrate group. In the carvedilol group glycosylated hemoglobin (HgbA1c) was also lower after the two months treatment period (p < 0.01).

Patients in the metoprolol succinate as well as the time control group-the group kept on carvedilol treatment-tended to have a lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level after the two months treatment. In the carvedilol group the HDL level was 1.47 ± 0.20 mmol/l before randomization and 1.24 ± 0.20 mmol/l two months after randomisation (p < 0.05). In the metoprolol succinate group, HDL level changed from 1.44 ± 0.16 mmol/l to 1.15 ± 0.11 before and after randomization, respectively (p < 0.05). HDL level in the metoprolol tartrate group was unchanged through the study period.

14.1 Hypertension

In a double-blind study, 1092 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension were randomized to once daily metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets (25 mg, 100 mg, or 400 mg), PLENDIL® (felodipine extended-release tablets), the combination, or placebo. After 9 weeks, metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets alone decreased sitting blood pressure by 6–8/4–7 mmHg (placebo-corrected change from baseline) at 24 hours post-dose. The combination of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets with PLENDIL has greater effects on blood pressure.

In controlled clinical studies, an immediate-release dosage form of metoprolol was an effective antihypertensive agent when used alone or as concomitant therapy with thiazide-type diuretics at dosages of 100 mg to 450 mg daily. Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, in dosages of 100 mg to 400 mg once daily, produces similar β1-blockade as conventional metoprolol tablets administered two to four times daily. In addition, metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets administered at a dose of 50 mg once daily lowered blood pressure 24-hours post-dosing in placebo-controlled studies. In controlled, comparative, clinical studies, immediate-release metoprolol appeared comparable as an antihypertensive agent to propranolol, methyldopa, and thiazide-type diuretics, and affected both supine and standing blood pressure. Because of variable plasma levels attained with a given dose and lack of a consistent relationship of antihypertensive activity to drug plasma concentration, selection of proper dosage requires individual titration.

14.2 Angina Pectoris

In controlled clinical trials, an immediate-release formulation of metoprolol has been shown to be an effective antianginal agent, reducing the number of angina attacks and increasing exercise tolerance. The dosage used in these studies ranged from 100 to 400 mg daily. Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, in dosages of 100 to 400 mg once daily, has been shown to possess betablockade similar to conventional metoprolol tablets administered two to four times daily.

### Impact of CYP2D6 polymorphisms on clinical efficacy and tolerability of metoprolol tartrate [^115mQBd7]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Metoprolol is a selective β-1 adrenergic receptor blocker that undergoes extensive metabolism by the polymorphic enzyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). Our objective was to investigate the influence of CYP2D6 polymorphisms on the efficacy and tolerability of metoprolol tartrate. Two hundred and eighty-one participants with uncomplicated hypertension received 50mg of metoprolol twice daily followed by response-guided titration to 100mg twice daily. Phenotypes were assigned based on results of CYP2D6 genotyping and copy number variation assays. Clinical response to metoprolol and adverse effect rates were analyzed in relation to CYP2D6 phenotypes using appropriate statistical tests. Heart rate response differed significantly by CYP2D6 phenotype (P < 0.0001), with poor and intermediate metabolizers showing greater reduction. However, blood pressure response and adverse effect rates were not significantly different by CYP2D6 phenotype. Other than a significant difference in heart rate response, CYP2D6 polymorphisms were not determinants of variability in metoprolol response or tolerability.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

The peak plasma levels following once-daily administration of extended release metoprolol succinate are reduced by 50 to 75% on average compared to a corresponding dose of immediate-release metoprolol tartrate, both when administered once daily or in divided doses. At steady state the average bioavailability of metoprolol following administration of metoprolol succinate, across the dosage range of 50 to 400 mg once daily, was reduced by 25% relative to the corresponding single or divided doses of immediate-release metoprolol tartrate. The bioavailability of metoprolol shows a dose-related, although not directly proportional, increase with dose. The exposure (Cmaxand AUC) of metoprolol succinate extended-release capsule are similar to that of TOPROL-XL®tablet.

Absorption

Plasma levels following oral administration of metoprolol tablet approximate 50% of levels following intravenous administration, indicating about 50% first-pass metabolism. Peak plasma concentration of metoprolol is attained at 10 hours following administration of metoprolol succinate extended-release capsule.

Effect of food

Compared to fasted state administration, high-fat, high-calorie meal (54.3% fat, 15.6% proteins and 30.1% carbohydrates) did not have a significant effect on the absorption of KAPSPARGO Sprinkle.

5.1 Abrupt Cessation of Therapy

Following abrupt cessation of therapy with certain beta-blocking agents, exacerbations of angina pectoris and, in some cases, myocardial infarction have occurred. When discontinuing chronically administered metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, gradually reduce the dosage over a period of 1 to 2 weeks and monitor the patient. If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary ischemia develops, promptly reinstate metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, and take measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina. Warn patients not to interrupt therapy without their physician's advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, avoid abruptly discontinuing metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets in patients treated only for hypertension.

5.2 Heart Failure

Worsening cardiac failure may occur during up-titration of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets. If such symptoms occur, increase diuretics and restore clinical stability before advancing the dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. It may be necessary to lower the dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets or temporarily discontinue it. Such episodes do not preclude subsequent successful titration of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets.

5.3 Bronchospastic Disease

Patients with bronchospastic diseases should, in general, not receive beta-blockers. Because of its relative beta1cardio-selectivity, however, metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets may be used in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, other antihypertensive treatment. Because beta1-selectivity is not absolute, use the lowest possible dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets. Bronchodilators, including beta2-agonists, should be readily available or administered concomitantly [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

5.4 Bradycardia

Bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, and cardiac arrest have occurred with the use of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets. Patients with first-degree atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, conduction disorders (including Wolff-Parkinson-White) or on concomitant drugs that cause bradycardia [see Drug Interactions (7.3)], may be at increased risk. Monitor heart rate in patients receiving metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets. If severe bradycardia develops, reduce or stop metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets.

### Long-term mortality associated with use of carvedilol versus metoprolol in heart failure patients with and without type 2 diabetes: a Danish nationwide cohort study [^111dE5cK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

The pharmacologic mechanism behind a theorized difference in outcome between carvedilol and metoprolol in the T2D population partly relates to impaired distribution of glucose to peripheral muscles and increased insulin resistance associated with the HF state. By blockage of the alpha receptors, carvedilol is thought to improve glucose distribution to peripheral tissue, theoretically thereby having the potential to improve glycemic control and possibly outcomes in patients with T2D and HF. Consistent with this proposed pharmacologic mechanism, there was a lower rate of incident T2D in patients free from T2D at the start of follow up for carvedilol versus metoprolol users in both COMET and our study (HR, 0.78 [95% CI 0.61–0.997] in the COMET study versus 0.83 [0.75–0.91] in our study). Further, to our knowledge, a subgroup analysis of COMET is the one study to date that examined mortality differences in carvedilol versus metoprolol in patients with T2D and HF. Ultimately, COMET suggested a small but insignificant reduction in mortality for carvedilol over metoprolol in patients with T2D (HR, 0.85 [0.69–1.06], P = 0.147), but with the limitation that the target dose of carvedilol (25 mg BID) was relatively higher than the target dose of metoprolol (50 mg BID, respectively). While there was no marginal mortality benefit for carvedilol in our study, our findings are overall consistent with other observational studies in the general HF population to date. Further, our study was based on a real‐world Danish sample where titration to maximally tolerated dosing of carvedilol (50 mg BID) and metoprolol (200 mg daily) was recommended, consistent with HF guidelines. A second possible explanation for the difference between our study and the COMET trial was that the patients included in the COMET study used only metoprolol tartrate, while metoprolol succinate is the standard practice in the long‐term HF treatment in Denmark.

### Association of treatment with carvedilol vs metoprolol succinate and mortality in patients with heart failure [^116KbMuU]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

The β-blockers carvedilol and metoprolol succinate both reduce mortality in patients with heart failure (HF), but the comparative clinical effectiveness of these drugs is unknown.

Objective

To investigate whether carvedilol is associated with improved survival compared with metoprolol succinate.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Cohort study of patients with incident HF with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (≤ 40%) who received carvedilol (n = 6026) or metoprolol succinate (n = 5638) using data from a Danish national HF registry linked with health care and administrative databases.

Main Outcomes and Measures

All-cause mortality (primary outcome) and cardiovascular mortality (secondary outcome) were analyzed using Cox regression with adjustment for a propensity score, derived from a range of clinical, socioeconomic, and demographic characteristics.

Results

The mean (SD) age of the patients was 69.3 (9.1) years, 71% were men, and 51% were hospitalized at index HF diagnosis. During a median (interquartile range) 2.4 (1.0–3.0) years of follow-up, 875 carvedilol users and 754 metoprolol users died; the cumulative incidence of mortality was 18.3% and 18.8%, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio for carvedilol users vs metoprolol users was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.88 to 1.11), corresponding to an absolute risk difference of -0.07 (95% CI, -0.84 to 0.77) deaths per 100 person-years. Estimates were consistent across subgroup analyses by sex, age, levels of LVEF, New York Heart Association classification, and history of ischemic heart disease. A higher proportion of carvedilol users achieved the recommended daily target dose (50 mg; 3124 [52%]) than did metoprolol users (200 mg; 689 [12%]); among patients who reached the target dose, the adjusted hazard ratio was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.72–1.30). A robustness analysis with 1:1 propensity score matching confirmed the primary findings (hazard ratio, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.84–1.13]). The adjusted hazard ratio for cardiovascular mortality was 1.05 (95% CI, 0.88–1.26).

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings from real-world clinical practice indicate that the effectiveness of carvedilol and metoprolol succinate in patients with HF is similar.

### Extended-release metoprolol succinate in chronic heart failure [^116LNxde]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and tolerability of extended-release (ER) metoprolol succinate and its role in the management of chronic heart failure.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search of English-language literature (1990-October 2002) was conducted using congestive heart failure and metoprolol CR/XL or metoprolol CR/ZOK as search terms to identify pertinent studies.

Study Selection/Data Extraction

All of the articles identified from the data sources were evaluated, with priority given to randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies.

Data Synthesis

ER metoprolol succinate is a controlled-release tablet designed to produce even and consistent beta(1)-blockade throughout the 24-hour dosing interval, with less fluctuation in metoprolol plasma concentrations compared with immediate-release metoprolol. Three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy of ER metoprolol succinate in the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure. The MERIT-HF (Metoprolol CR/XL Randomized Intervention Trial in Congestive Heart Failure) study, the largest of these trials and the largest randomized mortality trial with beta-blockers in heart failure to date, demonstrated that ER metoprolol succinate reduced the relative risk of all-cause mortality by 34% versus placebo. Furthermore, the relative risk of the combined endpoint of mortality plus all-cause hospitalizations was reduced by 19% and sudden death was reduced by 41%. The benefits of therapy were evident in various patient subgroups, including elderly patients and those with diabetes mellitus. ER metoprolol succinate was generally well tolerated, with a similar proportion of patients discontinuing therapy due to adverse events relative to placebo (9.8% and 11.7%, respectively).

Conclusions

ER metoprolol succinate therapy provides substantial mortality and morbidity benefits in patients with New York Heart Association class II and III heart failure who are stabilized on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics. ER metoprolol succinate is administered once daily, is well tolerated, and provides consistent beta(1)-blockade over the 24-hour dosing interval.

Critical factors that contribute to the widespread failure to achieve and maintain target doses of neurohormonal antagonists

Why are most patients with chronic heart failure treated for long periods of time with only one or two drugs or with doses that are much lower than the doses that have been shown to prolong life? There are several contributory factors.

First, many physicians may be unfamiliar with the doses of neurohormonal antagonists that have been shown to prolong survival in chronic heart failure. The target doses of most neurohormonal antagonists used to treat heart failure are typically higher than the doses of the drugs when they are used to treat other cardiovascular disorders. For example, the usual doses of candesartan and valsartan used for the treatment of hypertension (4–8 mg daily and 40–80 mg daily, respectively) are far lower than the target doses in the large‐scale trials in heart failure (32 and 320 mg daily, respectively). 30, 31 Similarly, the optimal dose for losartan for heart failure (150 mg daily) is higher than that approved in the US for any cardiovascular indication 19; the commonly prescribed dose of 50 mg daily appears to be inferior to ACE inhibitors with respect to mortality reduction. 32, 33 The dose of metoprolol succinate used for hypertension or angina is 25–100 mg daily, but the target dose used in the landmark heart failure trial was 200 mg daily. 34

### Β-blockers: a review of their pharmacological and physiological diversity in hypertension [^113vQBST]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic properties of commonly used β-blockers (atenolol, carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, metoprolol tartrate, and nebivolol).

Data Sources

A MEDLINE literature search (1966-May 2013) was performed using the following key terms: hypertension, β-blockers, atenolol, carvedilol, metoprolol tartrate, metoprolol succinate, nebivolol, pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, blood pressure, metabolic, lipid, central aortic pressure, diabetes, and insulin resistance. References from publications reviewed were included.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language articles identified were reviewed. Animal studies and studies in patients for a primary diagnosis of coronary artery disease were excluded.

Data Synthesis

β-Blockers are no longer recommended first-line therapy for primary hypertension, based on data showing that β-blockers are inferior to other antihypertensives and no better than placebo, in spite of provision of blood pressure reduction. Because atenolol is the β-blocker used in 75% of these studies, uncertainty about widespread application to all β-blockers exists. Different pharmacological and physiological properties, both within β-blockers and compared with other antihypertensives, may explain divergent effects. Evidence shows that β-blockers have a truncated effect on central aortic pressure, an independent predictor of cardiovascular events, compared with other antihypertensive classes; differences within the class may exist, but the evidence is inconclusive. Metabolic effects differ within the β-blocker class, with evidence that carvedilol causes less metabolic dysregulation.

Conclusion

Emerging evidence reveals physiological differences within the β-blocker class and in comparison to other antihypertensives. These differences provide insight into the diverse clinical effects β-blockers provide in cardiovascular disease.

6 CONCLUSION

Carvedilol improves survival free of appropriate ICD therapy compared with metoprolol succinate in patients with HFrEF. Because both these drugs are now available generically, a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to study the efficacy of these drugs in HFrEF (focused on both arrhythmic and nonarrhythmic outcomes) is warranted.

Endothelium-dependent vasodilatation assessed with infusion of increasing doses of serotonin was equal in the three groups before randomization and did not change after switching beta blocker treatment from carvedilol to metoprolol succinate or metoprolol tartrate: In the group randomized to metoprolol succinate the relative forearm blood flow was 1.24 ± 0.11; 1.21 ± 0.12; 1.54 ± 0.19; and 1.82 ± 0.29 at each dose level of serotonin before randomization treatment and 1.38 ± 0.16; 1.43 ± 0.15; 1.68 ± 0.26; and 2.10 ± 0.37 after two months treatment with metoprolol succinate (p = 0.27) (Figure 2a). In the group randomized to metoprolol tartrate the relative blood flow was 1.17 ± 0.08; 1.36 ± 0.19; 1.79 ± 0.18 and 2.57 ± 0.33 before randomization and 1.38 ± 0.23; 1.30 ± 0.21; 1.79 ± 0.34 and 2.42 ± 0.55 after the treatment period (p = 0.74) (Figure 2b). The third group was kept on carvedilol treatment after randomization and blood flow did not change during the treatment period: The blood flow was 1.18 ± 0.10; 1.25 ± 0.11; 1.87 ± 0.16 and 2.42 ± 0.33 before randomization and 1.24 ± 0.07; 1.22 ± 0.08; 1.80 ± 0.12 and 2.14 ± 0.24 after randomization treatment period (p = 0.34) (Figure 2c).

Second, physicians may recognize the inadequacy of low starting doses but may nonetheless believe that medium‐range doses provide most of the benefits of target doses. Theoretically, this premise would be true if medium‐range and high target doses were on the upper flat portion of the dose–response curve. Yet, in a clinical trials, higher doses have provided greater benefits than lower doses, 19, 20, 35, 36 and there is little evidence that medium‐range subtarget doses reduce the risk of death. Interestingly, the final step in the dose‐titration process to target doses may provide unexpectedly large survival benefits. In the COMET trial, 37 carvedilol (25 mg twice daily) was compared with metoprolol tartrate (50 mg twice daily) in a large double‐blind trial of > 3000 patients who were followed for nearly 5 years. At these doses, the heart rate reduction in the metoprolol group was within 1–2 bpm of that achieved in the carvedilol group, suggesting that metoprolol tartrate provided > 75% of the beta‐1 receptor blockade produced by carvedilol. 38 Yet, when compared with metoprolol, carvedilol was accompanied by a 20% lower risk of cardiovascular death. Since beta‐blockers reduce mortality by ≈30–35% when compared with placebo, 39 these observations suggest that more than half of the mortality reduction produced by target doses of beta‐blockers may be provided by the final step in the dose titration protocol. 40

To complicate matters further, it is not possible to state with confidence that differences in dosing within the subtarget range lead to different benefits. Can we claim that 10 mg of enalapril daily is superior to 5 mg daily? Do we know that metoprolol succinate 100 mg daily is superior to 50 mg daily? Because physicians cannot answer these questions, it is not possible to make evidence‐based comparative judgments. One can only ask if the patient was treated using the forced‐titration strategies that were deployed in the landmark clinical trials. We cannot assume that subtarget strategies are ineffective or inferior, but we do know that they are untested and unproven.

Therefore, we can ask physicians to describe (i) whether patients are receiving each of the recommended neurohormonal antagonists; (ii) whether patients are being treated with target doses of each of these drugs; and (iii) if they are receiving the drug at subtarget doses, whether the patient had been tried on higher doses that could not be tolerated, despite reasonable efforts at rechallenge or adjustment of concomitant medications. Accordingly, three strata are proposed. Stratum I represents the deployment of the specific trial‐based strategies that have been shown to prolong survival, i.e. the use of target doses or the use of the highest tolerated doses using the forced‐titration regimens shown to be effective in reducing mortality. Stratum II represents the use of the drug at a subtarget dose for reasons that are unrelated to demonstrable and clinically important intolerance (e.g. patient or physician preferences, overemphasis of clinical stability, fears of the possibility of adverse effects, lack of knowledge of target doses); all of these reasons are grouped together in a non‐hierarchical manner. This stratum is intended to encompass the prescribing of drugs in all ways that do not specifically replicate the strategies that were utilized in the landmark clinical trials. Stratum III indicates that the patient is not receiving the critical drug at any dose.

Medication Information

GDMT for CAD and HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) were identified as therapies with a Class 1, Level of Evidence A recommendation using ACC/AHA clinical practice guidelines. – Class 1 recommendations are those for which the benefits significantly outweigh risks, and the treatment should be administered. Level of Evidence A means that data supporting the recommendation are derived from multiple randomized clinical trials or meta-analyses. For CAD, patient receipt of 1) either aspirin or clopidogrel and 2) a high-intensity statin was included. We also included beta-blocker prescriptions, since this class of medications is recommended (Class 1) for patients with an acute coronary syndrome, which is often the presenting marker of CAD, and these medications are also frequently used in CAD. As there are published data on underuse of statins and some patients are started at low or moderate doses, we also sought to examine if any cholesterol-lowering therapy was prescribed (including bile-acid sequestrants, fibrates, omega-3 fatty acids, and any statin dose). For HF, patient receipt of both a composite of the following medication classes and each class independently, 1) guideline-recommended beta-blocker (i.e. metoprolol [we examined any metoprolol and not just metoprolol succinate, since patients are often started and titrated on metoprolol tartrate and then transitioned to metoprolol succinate], carvedilol, or bisoprolol); 2) ACE inhibitor or ARB; and 3) mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist was included.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

The peak plasma levels following once-daily administration of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets average one-fourth to one-half the peak plasma levels obtained following a corresponding dose of conventional metoprolol, administered once daily or in divided doses. At steady state the average bioavailability of metoprolol following administration of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, across the dosage range of 50 to 400 mg once daily, was 77% relative to the corresponding single or divided doses of conventional metoprolol.

The bioavailability of metoprolol shows a dose-related, although not directly proportional, increase with dose and is not significantly affected by food following metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets administration.

The peak plasma levels following oral administration of conventional metoprolol tablets, however, approximate 50% of levels following intravenous administration, indicating about 50% first-pass metabolism.

Distribution

Metoprolol crosses the blood-brain barrier and has been reported in the CSF in a concentration 78% of the simultaneous plasma concentration. Only a small fraction of the drug (about 12%) is bound to human serum albumin.

Metabolism

Metoprolol is a racemic mixture of R- and S- enantiomers and is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6. When administered orally, it exhibits stereoselective metabolism that is dependent on oxidation phenotype.

### Effect of carvedilol vs metoprolol succinate on mortality in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^115s4B8C]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Beta blocker therapy is indicated in all patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) as per current guidelines. The relative benefit of carvedilol to metoprolol succinate remains unknown. This study aimed to compare survival benefit of carvedilol to metoprolol succinate.

Methods

The VA's databases were queried to identify 114,745 patients diagnosed with HFrEF from 2007 to 2015 who were prescribed carvedilol and metoprolol succinate. The study estimated the survival probability and hazard ratio by comparing the carvedilol and metoprolol patients using propensity score matching with replacement techniques on observed covariates. Sub-group analyses were performed separately for men, women, elderly, duration of therapy of more than 3 months, and diabetic patients.

Results

A total of 43,941 metoprolol patients were matched with as many carvedilol patients. The adjusted hazard ratio of mortality for metoprolol succinate compared to carvedilol was 1.069 (95% CI: 1.046–1.092, P value: < .001). At six years, the survival probability was higher in the carvedilol group compared to the metoprolol succinate group (55.6% vs 49.2%, P value < .001). The sub-group analyses show that the results hold true separately for male, over or under 65 years old, therapy duration more than three months and non-diabetic patients.

Conclusion

Patients with HFrEF taking carvedilol had improved survival as compared to metoprolol succinate. The data supports the need for furthering testing to determine optimal choice of beta blockers in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

POISE trial — extended-release metoprolol succinate protocol and eligibility are summarized as follows: Patients undergoing noncardiac surgery were randomly assigned to extended-release metoprolol succinate or placebo starting 2 to 4 hours before surgery and continued for 30 days, with a primary end point of a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal cardiac arrest, and eligibility included an expected hospital stay of at least 24 hours with specified cardiovascular risk criteria. The first dose was 100 mg given 2 to 4 hours preoperatively; drug administration required a heart rate of 50 bpm or higher and a systolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or greater; and if during the first 6 postoperative hours heart rate was 80 bpm or more and systolic blood pressure was 100 mm Hg or higher the first postoperative 100 mg dose was given orally, otherwise it was given at 6 hours after surgery. Twelve hours after the first postoperative dose, patients took extended-release metoprolol 200 mg or placebo every day for 30 days; if heart rate was consistently below 45 bpm or systolic blood pressure dropped below 100 mm Hg the study drug was withheld and then restarted at 100 mg once daily, and if heart rate was consistently 45 to 49 bpm with systolic blood pressure exceeded 100 mm Hg the study drug was delayed for 12 hours. Patients unable to take oral medications received intravenous infusion options of a slow infusion of 15 mg over 60 minutes or a rapid infusion of 5 mg over 2 minutes every 5 minutes up to a total of 15 mg, and the final analysis included 8351 patients from 190 hospitals in 23 countries.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Clinical pharmacology studies have confirmed the beta-blocking activity of metoprolol in man, as shown by (1) reduction in heart rate and cardiac output at rest and upon exercise, (2) reduction of systolic blood pressure upon exercise, (3) inhibition of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia, and (4) reduction of reflex orthostatic tachycardia.

The relationship between plasma metoprolol levels and reduction in exercise heart rate is independent of the pharmaceutical formulation. Beta1-blocking effects in the range of 30–80% of the maximal effect (approximately 8 to 23% reduction in exercise heart rate) correspond to metoprolol plasma concentrations from 30 to 540 nmol/L. The relative beta1-selectivity of metoprolol diminishes and blockade of beta2-adrenoceptors increases at plasma concentration above 300 nmol/L.

In five controlled studies in normal healthy subjects, extended-release metoprolol succinate administered once a day, and immediate-release metoprolol administered once to four times a day, provided comparable total beta1-blockade over 24 hours (area under the beta1-blockade versus time curve) in the dose range 100 to 400 mg. In another controlled study, 50 mg once daily for each product, extended-release metoprolol succinate produced significantly higher total beta1-blockade over 24 hours than immediate-release metoprolol. For extended-release metoprolol succinate, the percent reduction in exercise heart rate was relatively stable throughout the entire dosage interval and the level of beta1-blockade increased with increasing doses from 50 to 300 mg daily.

### Atenolol is associated with lower day-of-surgery heart rate compared to long-and short-acting metoprolol [^113Dt1rS]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The authors analyzed the association between outpatient β-blocker type and day-of-surgery (DOS) heart rate in ambulatory surgical patients. They further investigated whether differences in DOS heart rate between atenolol and metoprolol could be explained by once-daily versus twice-daily dosing regimens.

Design

Retrospective observational study.

Setting

Veterans Administration hospital.

Participants

Ambulatory surgical patients on long-term atenolol or metoprolol.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Using a propensity-score-matched cohort, DOS heart rates were compared in patients prescribed atenolol versus metoprolol. Then, once-daily and twice-daily metoprolol formulations were differentiated and DOS heart rates were compared within a general linear model. DOS heart rates in patients prescribed atenolol versus any metoprolol formulation were slower by a mean of 5.1 beats/min (66.6 v 71.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] of difference, 1.9–8.3; p = 0.002), a difference that was not observed in preoperative primary care visits. The general linear model showed that patients prescribed atenolol (typically once-daily dosing) had a mean DOS heart rate 5.6 beats/min lower compared with patients prescribed once-daily metoprolol succinate (68.9 v 74.5; 95% CI of difference, -8.6 to -2.6; p < 0.001) and 3.8 beats/min lower compared with patients prescribed twice-daily metoprolol tartrate (68.9 v 72.7; 95% CI of difference, -6.1 to -1.6; p < 0.001). DOS heart rates were similar between different formulations of metoprolol (95% CI of difference, -1.0 to +4.6; p = 0.22).

Conclusions

Atenolol is associated with a lower DOS heart rate versus metoprolol. The heart rate difference is specific to the day of surgery and is not explained by once-daily versus twice-daily dosing regimens.

### A comparison of anti-arrhythmic efficacy of carvedilol vs metoprolol succinate in patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators [^1132TPmq]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

5 STUDY LIMITATIONS

This was a retrospective, nonrandomized, single center study. We studied beta‐blocker type and dose at device implantation (a prespecified intention to treat type of analysis) and about 10% of the cohort switched between the two beta‐blockers during the course of follow‐up. Compliance with beta‐blockers could not be assessed due to the retrospective study design. Programming of ICD therapies was at the discretion of the treating electrophysiologist and may have affected the incidence of the type of therapy administered for ventricular arrhythmias. However, this did not affect the combined endpoint of ICD shocks and ATP. Though the number of patients included was relatively small, this is the first real world, well matched analysis of the efficacy of these drugs in preventing ICD therapies. We limited our analysis to time to event rather than cumulative event rates since patients who receive ICD therapies are often started on other anti‐arrhythmic drugs which preclude assessment of the efficacy of the beta‐blocker alone. We did not collect data on heart rate which is often used as a surrogate marker for efficacy of beta blockade. However, the superiority of carvedilol over metoprolol at the highest dose equivalents suggests that factors other than rate reduction by beta1 antagonism may be at play. Finally, residual confounders not included in the analyses may have biased our results.

### 2020 ACC / AHA clinical performance and quality measures for adults with heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on performance measures [^116LtvZ9]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2020). High credibility.

PM-4: Beta-blocker therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) — The performance measure defines the percentage of patients age ≥ 18 with a diagnosis of heart failure with a current or prior left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40% who were prescribed beta-blocker therapy either within a 12-mo period when seen in the outpatient setting or at hospital discharge. The numerator is patients who were prescribed beta-blocker therapy either within a 12-mo period when seen in the outpatient setting or at hospital discharge, where outpatient includes a prescription at ≥ 1 visits in the 12-mo measurement period or documentation that the patient is already taking a beta blocker, and inpatient includes a prescription at discharge or documentation to continue therapy after discharge; beta-blocker therapy should include bisoprolol, carvedilol, or sustained-release metoprolol succinate. The denominator is all patients age ≥ 18 with a diagnosis of heart failure with a current or prior LVEF ≤ 40%, with denominator exclusions of heart transplant and LVAD and denominator exceptions for documentation of medical reason(s) (e.g., intolerance) or patient reason(s) (e.g., patient refusal) for not prescribing beta-blocker therapy. Rationale states that beta blockers improve survival and reduce hospitalization for patients with stable heart failure and reduced LVEF, and treatment should be initiated as soon as a patient is diagnosed with reduced LVEF and does not have prohibitively low systemic blood pressure, fluid overload, or recent treatment with an intravenous positive inotropic agent. Clinical recommendations cited are that use of 1 of the 3 beta blockers proven to reduce mortality (bisoprolol, carvedilol, sustained-release metoprolol succinate) is recommended for all patients with current or prior symptoms of HFrEF, unless contraindicated, to reduce morbidity and mortality (Class I, Level of Evidence: A), and that initiation of beta-blocker therapy is recommended after optimization of volume status and successful discontinuation of intravenous diuretics, vasodilators, and inotropic agents; therapy should be initiated at a low dose and only in stable patients, with caution when patients have required inotropes during their hospital course (Class I, Level of Evidence: B).

8.4 Pediatric Use

One hundred forty-four hypertensive pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years were randomized to placebo or to one of three dose levels of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets (0.2 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg once daily) and followed for 4 weeks. The study did not meet its primary endpoint (dose response for reduction in SBP). Some pre-specified secondary endpoints demonstrated effectiveness including:

- Dose-response for reduction in DBP,

- 1 mg/kg vs. placebo for change in SBP, and

- 2 mg/kg vs. placebo for change in SBP and DBP.

The mean placebo corrected reductions in SBP ranged from 3 to 6 mmHg, and DBP from 1 to 5 mmHg. Mean reduction in heart rate ranged from 5 to 7 bpm but considerably greater reductions were seen in some individuals [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

No clinically relevant differences in the adverse event profile were observed for pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years as compared with adult patients. Safety and effectiveness of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets have not been established in patients < 6 years of age.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets in hypertension did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience in hypertensive patients has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients.

Of the 1,990 patients with heart failure randomized to metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets in the MERIT-HF trial, 50% (990) were 65 years of age and older and 12% (238) were 75 years of age and older. There were no notable differences in efficacy or the rate of adverse reactions between older and younger patients.

In general, use a low initial starting dose in elderly patients given their greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

No studies have been performed with metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets in patients with hepatic impairment. Because metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are metabolized by the liver, metoprolol blood levels are likely to increase substantially with poor hepatic function. Therefore, initiate therapy at doses lower than those recommended for a given indication; and increase doses gradually in patients with impaired hepatic function.

### Kidney function and population-based outcomes of initiating oral atenolol versus metoprolol tartrate in older adults [^116iHWLV]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Atenolol and metoprolol tartrate are commonly prescribed β-blockers. Atenolol elimination depends on kidney function, whereas metoprolol tartrate does not. We hypothesized that compared to metoprolol tartrate, initiating oral atenolol treatment would be associated with more adverse events in older adults, with the association most pronounced in patients with lower baseline estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs).

Study Design

Population-based matched retrospective cohort study.

Setting & Participants

Older adults (mean age, 75 years) in Ontario, Canada, prescribed oral atenolol versus metoprolol tartrate from April 2002 through December 2011. The 2 groups were well matched (n = 75,257 in each group), with no difference in 31 measured baseline characteristics. Patients with end-stage renal disease were ineligible, and 4.6% of patients had chronic kidney disease (median eGFR, 38mL/min/1.73m(2) assessed through a database algorithm).

Predictors

β-Blocker type and eGFR.

Outcomes

A composite outcome of hospitalization with bradycardia or hypotension and all-cause mortality were assessed in 90-day follow-up.

Results

Compared to metoprolol tartrate, initiating atenolol treatment was not associated with higher risk of hospitalization with bradycardia or hypotension (incidence, 0.71% vs 0.79%; relative risk, 0.90; 95%CI, 0.80–1.01). Atenolol treatment initiation was associated with lower 90-day risk of mortality than metoprolol tartrate (incidence, 0.97% vs 1.44%; relative risk, 0.68; 95%CI, 0.61–0.74). Lower eGFR did not modify either association (P for interaction = 0.5 and 0.6, respectively).

Limitations

Heart rate and blood pressure were not available in our data sources, and effects ascertained from observational studies are subject to residual confounding.

Conclusions

Contrary to our expectation, we found that atenolol versus metoprolol tartrate was associated with lower 90-day risk of mortality in patients regardless of eGFR, with no difference in risk of hospitalization with bradycardia or hypotension.

### Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, USP 25… [^1132wgpb]. FDA (DailyMed) (2010). Low credibility.

Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets administered once a day, and immediate-release metoprolol administered once to four times a day, provided comparable total beta1-blockade over 24 hours in the dose range 100 to 400 mg. At a dosage of 50 mg once daily, metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets produced significantly higher total beta1-blockade over 24 hours than immediate-release metoprolol. Plasma levels achieved are highly variable after oral administration. Only a small fraction of the drug is bound to human serum albumin. Metoprolol is a racemic mixture of R- and S-enantiomers, and is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6. When administered orally, it exhibits stereoselective metabolism that is dependent on oxidation phenotype. The combination of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets with felodipine extended-release tablets has greater effects on blood pressure.

Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are indicated for the treatment of stable, symptomatic heart failure of ischemic, hypertensive, or cardiomyopathic origin. It was studied in patients already receiving ACE inhibitors, diuretics, and, in the majority of cases, digitalis. In this population, metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets decreased the rate of mortality plus hospitalization, largely through a reduction in cardiovascular mortality and hospitalizations for heart failure. Long-term studies in animals have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of metoprolol tartrate. In 2-year studies in rats at three oral dosage levels of up to 800 mg/kg/day, there was no increase in the development of spontaneously occurring benign or malignant neoplasms of any type.

The only histologic changes that appeared to be drug related were an increased incidence of generally mild focal accumulation of foamy macrophages in pulmonary alveoli and a slight increase in biliary hyperplasia. In a 21-month study in Swiss albino mice at three oral dosage levels of up to 750 mg/kg/day, benign lung tumors occurred more frequently in female mice receiving the highest dose than in untreated control animals.

Inactive Ingredients. Tablets contain colloidal silicon dioxide, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, polysorbate, povidone, sodium starch glycolate, talc and titanium dioxide. Mechanism of Action: Metoprolol Tartrate is a beta1-selective adrenergic receptor blocker. This preferential effect is not absolute, however, and at higher plasma concentrations, Metoprolol Tartrate also inhibits beta2-adrenoreceptors, chiefly located in the bronchial and vascular musculature. Relative beta1 selectivity is demonstrated by the following: In healthy subjects, Metoprolol Tartrate is unable to reverse the beta2-mediated vasodilating effects of epinephrine. This contrasts with the effect of nonselective beta blockers, which completely reverse the vasodilating effects of epinephrine.

In asthmatic patients, Metoprolol Tartrate reduces FEV1 and FVC significantly less than a nonselective beta blocker, propranolol, at equivalent beta1-receptor blocking doses. Metoprolol Tartrate has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and membrane-stabilizing activity is detectable only at doses much greater than required for beta blockade. Animal and human experiments indicate that Metoprolol Tartrate slows the sinus rate and decreases AV nodal conduction. Metabolism: Metoprolol Tartrate is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6. Metoprolol is a racemic mixture of R- and S- enantiomers, and when administered orally, it exhibits stereoselective metabolism that is dependent on oxidation phenotype. CYP2D6 is absent in about 8% of Caucasians and about 2% of most other populations. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies in animals have been conducted to evaluate carcinogenic potential.

In a 2- year study in rats at three oral dosage levels of up to 800 mg/kg per day, there was no increase in the development of spontaneously occurring benign or malignant neoplasms of any type.
