## Question

Which is better in cirrhosis patients ffp or cryoprecptitie

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which is better in cirrhosis patients, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or cryoprecipitate, and in what situations each should be used. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of hemostasis in cirrhosis and why conventional tests mislead us. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines say about FFP and cryoprecipitate in cirrhosis. Next, I will compare the composition, volume, and clinical effects of FFP versus cryoprecipitate. After that, I need to distinguish prophylactic use before procedures from active bleeding scenarios. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and note alternatives and monitoring strategies, making sure I double-check any numeric thresholds before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the core principle: patients with cirrhosis have rebalanced hemostasis, so prolonged INR and low platelets do not reliably predict bleeding, and correcting INR with FFP rarely improves thrombin generation while adding volume and risk. Cryoprecipitate is not for "correcting INR" but for replacing fibrinogen when it is truly low and clinically relevant, which is a different problem altogether [^d76db245] [^f1361cd1] [^fc2d60fe].

> I need to check guideline positions on FFP in cirrhosis. Multiple high-credibility societies advise against routine FFP to correct INR before procedures or for prophylaxis, citing lack of benefit and potential harm from volume expansion and portal hypertension. This applies to AGA, AASLD, EASL, and ACG guidance, and extends to acute variceal bleeding where FFP is not recommended either [^bdbc4084] [^f3d15e7e] [^babc8c3e] [^da9df041] [^e3581209].

> Now, let me verify cryoprecipitate's role. Cryoprecipitate is a low-volume, fibrinogen-rich product used to treat clinically significant hypofibrinogenemia, typically when fibrinogen is below about 100–120 mg/dL in the context of active bleeding or high-risk procedures. It does not correct INR and is not indicated for routine prophylaxis, and its use should be targeted and, when possible, guided by viscoelastic testing or serial fibrinogen measurements [^e526d79b] [^03500742] [^e2df2517] [^2d8e89d5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should compare mechanisms and volumes. FFP is roughly 250 mL per unit and dosed around 10 mL/kg, so correcting INR in cirrhosis often requires 1–2 liters, which can raise portal pressure and worsen variceal dynamics. In contrast, cryoprecipitate is about 10–20 mL per unit and delivers concentrated fibrinogen, allowing meaningful fibrinogen repletion with far less volume, which is advantageous in cirrhosis where volume sensitivity is high [^1757c4f2] [^e526d79b] [^88bc34ad].

> Next, I should review the evidence base. Randomized and prospective data show FFP minimally improves thrombin generation in cirrhosis and frequently worsens it in a substantial subset, while TEG-guided strategies that avoid reflex FFP reduce transfusions without increasing bleeding. Observational data also show no reduction in procedure-related bleeding with prophylactic FFP or platelets, reinforcing a restrictive approach [^fc2d60fe] [^f24185d2] [^72aebea5] [^2fde9c7a].

> I will now examine active bleeding scenarios. In acute variceal hemorrhage, current guidance recommends restrictive transfusion targets for RBCs and avoidance of routine FFP or cryoprecipitate. Correction is reserved for specific deficits such as severe hypofibrinogenemia, and even then, evidence is limited and decisions should be individualized. In nonvariceal upper GI bleeding, TEG-guided algorithms reduce component use without compromising hemostasis, again arguing against blanket FFP [^e3581209] [^494cf6fd] [^72aebea5].

> But wait, what if the patient is about to undergo a procedure? For low-risk procedures like paracentesis, thoracentesis, routine endoscopy, or variceal banding, guidelines advise against routine FFP or cryoprecipitate. For high-risk procedures, if fibrinogen is low, targeted cryoprecipitate can be considered, whereas FFP to "correct INR" is discouraged. If available, viscoelastic testing can further reduce unnecessary transfusions [^bdbc4084] [^52092364] [^f24185d2].

> I should double-check numeric thresholds. Most liver-focused guidance uses fibrinogen less than about 100–120 mg/dL as a pragmatic trigger to consider replacement in bleeding or high-risk settings, acknowledging the evidence is indirect. Importantly, fibrinogen levels below 100 mg/dL are uncommon in stable cirrhosis and more often reflect acute decompensation, sepsis, or DIC, where the underlying driver must be treated in parallel [^e2df2517] [^03500742] [^1e4ec8b7].

> Let me consider alternatives and special situations. When fibrinogen repletion is needed and pathogen-reduced options are available, fibrinogen concentrate offers standardized dosing and lower infection risk than cryoprecipitate, though data in cirrhosis are limited. For warfarin reversal in active bleeding, 4-factor PCC is preferred over FFP for speed and volume. And for thrombocytopenia around high-risk procedures, TPO receptor agonists can be considered when time allows, rather than routine platelet transfusion [^a8d1b728] [^da16d431] [^e414b645].

> I should confirm monitoring guidance. Because INR does not reflect hemostatic competence in cirrhosis, viscoelastic testing can reduce unnecessary FFP and platelet use, but it requires institutional protocols and education to avoid misinterpretation. When cryoprecipitate is used, serial fibrinogen levels should guide redosing rather than chasing INR [^f24185d2] [^72aebea5] [^2d8e89d5].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. FFP is not "better" than cryoprecipitate in cirrhosis; in fact, routine FFP is generally discouraged because it does not meaningfully improve hemostasis and adds volume-related risks, whereas cryoprecipitate is the product of choice when there is clinically significant hypofibrinogenemia in the context of active bleeding or a high-risk procedure, used sparingly and ideally with viscoelastic or laboratory guidance [^bdbc4084] [^f3d15e7e] [^e526d79b] [^e2df2517].

In cirrhosis, **cryoprecipitate is preferred over FFP** when fibrinogen is low (< 1.5 g/L) or there is active bleeding with hypofibrinogenemia, because it provides concentrated fibrinogen with minimal volume and avoids the volume overload and portal hypertension risks of FFP [^e526d79b] [^e2df2517]. FFP is **not recommended for routine INR correction** in cirrhosis because INR does not reflect bleeding risk and FFP rarely improves thrombin generation; it may worsen portal hypertension and cause transfusion-related complications [^f3d15e7e] [^fc2d60fe] [^74de0bff]. Use FFP only for active bleeding with multiple factor deficiencies or before high-risk procedures when cryoprecipitate is unavailable, and consider fibrinogen concentrate when available [^52092364] [^a8d1b728].

## Pharmacological differences between FFP and cryoprecipitate

| **Parameter** | **Ffp** | **Cryoprecipitate** |
|-|-|-|
| Composition | Contains all coagulation factors, including fibrinogen, but at dilute concentrations | Rich in fibrinogen, factor VIII, von Willebrand factor, and factor XIII |
| Volume per unit | ~250 mL | ~10–20 mL |
| Fibrinogen content | ~2–4 mg/mL | ~15–30 mg/mL |
| Clinical use | General replacement of multiple coagulation factors | Specific replacement of fibrinogen and selected factors |

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

### FFP in cirrhosis

- **Limited efficacy**: FFP transfusion minimally improves thrombin generation and often worsens coagulopathy in cirrhosis, with only modest INR correction and no consistent clinical benefit [^fc2d60fe] [^6a7f1aad].
- **Volume overload and portal hypertension**: Large volumes of FFP can exacerbate portal hypertension, increase rebleeding risk, and cause transfusion-related complications (TACO, TRALI) [^74de0bff] [^f610a715].
- **Guideline recommendations**: Major societies (AASLD, AGA, EASL) recommend against routine FFP use for INR correction or prophylaxis in cirrhosis due to lack of benefit and potential harm [^f3d15e7e] [^babc8c3e] [^da9df041].

---

### Cryoprecipitate in cirrhosis

- **Targeted fibrinogen replacement**: Cryoprecipitate effectively raises fibrinogen with low volume, which is critical in cirrhosis where fibrinogen deficiency is common in acute bleeding or decompensation [^e526d79b] [^e2df2517].
- **Guideline support**: AASLD and EASL endorse cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen repletion in actively bleeding cirrhotic patients or before high-risk procedures when fibrinogen is low, favoring its low-volume profile over FFP [^52092364] [^e2df2517].
- **Safety considerations**: Cryoprecipitate carries risks (allergic reactions, infection) but lower volume reduces circulatory overload and portal hypertension compared with FFP [^74de0bff].

---

## Clinical scenarios and recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended product** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Active bleeding with low fibrinogen (< 1.5 g/L) | Cryoprecipitate | - Concentrated fibrinogen <br/> - Minimal volume <br/> - Avoids volume overload |
| Routine INR correction or prophylaxis before low-risk procedures | Neither FFP nor cryoprecipitate | - No benefit <br/> - Potential harm from volume overload [^bdbc4084] [^f3d15e7e] |
| Multiple factor deficiencies with active bleeding | FFP (if cryoprecipitate unavailable) | Provides broader factor replacement but with higher volume risk [^2d8e89d5] |
| High-risk procedures (e.g. liver biopsy, TIPS) with low fibrinogen | Cryoprecipitate | Targeted fibrinogen repletion with low volume [^52092364] [^e2df2517] |

---

## Alternative therapies

Fibrinogen concentrate is a **low-volume, pathogen-reduced alternative** to cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen replacement, though data in cirrhosis are limited and availability varies [^a8d1b728]. Four-factor PCC is a **low-volume option** for rapid correction of vitamin K–dependent factors, but INR-based dosing is problematic in cirrhosis and thrombotic risk remains a concern [^f35fcc2e].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Cryoprecipitate**: Preferred for low fibrinogen states in cirrhosis, especially with active bleeding or before high-risk procedures, due to concentrated fibrinogen and low volume [^52092364] [^e2df2517].
- **FFP**: Avoid routine use for INR correction or prophylaxis; consider only for active bleeding with multiple factor deficiencies when cryoprecipitate is unavailable, balancing volume risks [^f3d15e7e] [^da9df041].
- **Individualized approach**: Base transfusion decisions on clinical context, procedure risk, and laboratory parameters, prioritizing low-volume, targeted therapies to minimize complications [^d2e88691] [^b3173156].

---

Cryoprecipitate is **superior to FFP** for cirrhotic patients with low fibrinogen or active bleeding because it delivers concentrated fibrinogen with minimal volume, whereas FFP is ineffective for INR correction and poses volume-related risks. Use FFP only when multiple factor deficiencies coexist and cryoprecipitate is unavailable, and consider fibrinogen concentrate when accessible [^52092364] [^e2df2517] [^a8d1b728].

### The evidence-based use of FFP and cryoprecipitate for abnormalities of coagulation tests and clinical coagulopathy [^7ed9ce0e]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2007). Low credibility.

There continues to be a general but unfounded enthusiasm for fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or frozen plasma (FP) usage across a range of clinical specialties in hospital practice. Plasma for transfusion is most often used where there are abnormal coagulation screening tests, either therapeutically in the face of bleeding, or prophylactically in nonbleeding patients prior to invasive procedures or surgery. Little evidence exists to inform best therapeutic transfusion practice, and most studies describe plasma use in a prophylactic setting. Laboratory abnormalities of coagulation are considered by many clinicians to be a predictive risk factor for bleeding prior to invasive procedures or in other clinical situations where bleeding risk exists, and plasma for transfusion is presumed to improve the laboratory results and reduce this risk. However, most guideline indications for the prophylactic use of plasma for transfusion are not supported by evidence from good-quality randomized trials. Arguably, the strongest randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence indicates that prophylactic plasma for transfusion is not effective across a range of different clinical settings, and this is supported by data from nonrandomized studies in patients with mild to moderate abnormalities in coagulation tests. There is a need to undertake new trials evaluating the efficacy and adverse effects of plasma, both in bleeding and non-bleeding patients, to understand whether the presumed benefits outweigh the real risks. In addition, new hemostatic tests that better define the risk of bleeding and monitor the effectiveness of the use of FFP should be validated. Last, there is an opportunity to develop effective educational strategies aimed at addressing understanding and compliance with recommendations in guidelines.

AASLD Practice Guidance — procedural bleeding risk and transfusion strategies in cirrhosis/ACLF: Bleeding rates for paracentesis (0%–3.3%) and thoracentesis (2%) in patients with cirrhosis are low and do not require routine preprocedural coagulation assessment in decompensated cirrhosis or ACLF. Reported bleeding rates for liver biopsy are higher in patients with < 50 platelets/L, and transjugular liver biopsy is relatively safe even with decreased platelet counts or prolonged INR. When correction is needed, transfusion of low volume cryoprecipitate or four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate are preferred to high-volume fresh frozen plasma. TEG-guided strategies resulted in fewer blood transfusions compared with standard of care without differences in failure to control bleeding, rebleeding, or mortality; in a randomized trial of 60 patients undergoing invasive procedures, TEG-guided transfusion (fresh frozen plasma trigger: reaction time > 40 min; platelet trigger: maximum amplitude < 30 mm) decreased transfusions (16.7% vs. 100%; p < 0.0001) with no difference in bleeding or 90-day mortality.

### Procoagulant therapeutics in liver disease: a critique and clinical rationale [^1bd74151]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

The complex nature of haemostasis in patients with liver disease can result in bleeding and/or thrombosis. These opposing outcomes, which have multiple contributing factors, can pose diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas for physicians. With the high rate of haemorrhagic complications in patients with cirrhosis, we examine the various procoagulants available for use in this population. In this Review, we describe the clinical and current rationale for using each of the currently available procoagulants-vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), cryoprecipitate, platelets, recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa), antifibrinolytics, prothrombin concentrate complexes (PCC), desmopressin and red blood cells. By examining the evidence and use of these agents in liver disease, we provide a framework for targeted, goal-directed therapy with procoagulants.

### Cryoprecipitate therapy [^479b9f1f]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Liver disease

One study investigated the use of cryoprecipitate for acquired hypofibrinogenaemia after massive haemorrhage in LT. The study found that intraoperative transfusion of cryoprecipitate was associated with biliary complications, a significant source of patient morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing LT. The authors concluded that cryoprecipitate should only be used in this setting after careful consideration.

In patients with liver disease, the efficacy of cryoprecipitate was compared with that of FFP. Seventeen patients received either 4 U FFP or 5 U cryoprecipitate. Although cryoprecipitate improved coagulopathy, 4 U FFP were more efficacious, produced a significantly greater improvement in international normalized ratio and activated partial thromboplastin time parameters, and resulted in less exposure to blood products than 5 U cryoprecipitate. Patients with liver disease often have multiple deficiencies of both procoagulant and anticoagulant factors. FFP contains both procoagulant and anticoagulant factors at close to normal or below normal concentrations, which may suggest that FFP is more suitable than cryoprecipitate for haemostatic therapy in these patients. At the same time, it must be kept in mind that transfusion may aggravate portal hypertension in these patients, and may paradoxically result in an increased bleeding tendency. Therefore, the matter of the choice of haemostatic agent in this setting is still under debate.

### Prophylactic fresh frozen plasma and platelet transfusion have a prothrombotic effect in patients with liver disease [^3816648b]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Although there is increasingly broad consensus on the futility of INR correction with FFP for preventing bleeding complications in this setting, there is none on the requirement to correct cirrhotic thrombocytopenia. High‐quality research in this specific field is scarce, and clinical studies have shown contradicting results. 12, 13 Guidelines defining the indication for platelet transfusion in patients with liver disease‐associated thrombocytopenia are not uniform, although most guidelines maintain a platelet count threshold of 50 × 10 9 /L for patients with liver disease before invasive procedures. 14

In addition to doubts on whether prolonged INR and thrombocytopenia in cirrhosis are associated with bleeding risk, the efficacy of FFP and platelet transfusions in patients with liver disease has been questioned. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that although FFP improves the INR in patients with liver disease, there is no appreciable increase in hemostatic potential as estimated by thrombin generation tests. 15, 16, 17 In addition, several clinical studies have shown that FFP or platelet transfusions only minimally improve the hemostatic status of patients with liver disease and did not reduce bleeding risk. 17, 18, 19

Importantly, bleeding risk is, next to a patient's hemostatic status, determined by the procedure and operator. Extensive research has shown that many of the common procedures that patients with liver disease undergo (eg, endoscopy, paracentesis), have a low to very low bleeding risk, which further questions the need for prophylactic prohemostatic interventions. 6 Further, every transfusion is associated with the risk of transfusion‐related complications, such as circulatory overload, transfusion‐related acute lung injury, and infection, and those risks may be higher in patients with liver disease. 20, 21, 22

Here, we examined the hemostatic efficacy of prophylactic FFP and platelet transfusions to patients with chronic liver disease‐associated hemostatic changes. We specifically studied patients that were deemed to require FFP or platelet transfusion before an invasive procedure by their treating physician in a real‐life clinical setting.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the management of coagulation disorders in patients with cirrhosis [^234c2faa]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Preprocedural blood product transfusion in stable cirrhosis — For patients with stable cirrhosis undergoing common gastrointestinal procedures (eg, paracentesis, thoracentesis, variceal banding, colonic polypectomy, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [ERCP], and liver biopsy), the AGA suggests against the routine use of blood products (eg, fresh frozen plasma [FFP] or platelets [PLTs]) for bleeding prophylaxis. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty evidence). This recommendation applies to the majority of patients with stable cirrhosis who usually do not have severe thrombocytopenia or severe coagulopathy, and in those with severe derangements in coagulation or thrombocytopenia undergoing a high-risk procedure, decisions about prophylactic blood transfusions should include discussion about potential benefits and risks (including transfusion reactions and delay of procedures) in consultation with a hematologist.

### AGA clinical practice update: coagulation in cirrhosis [^f35fcc2e]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — transfusion thresholds and blood product selection in cirrhosis — blood products should be used sparingly because they increase portal pressure and carry transfusion risks; when managing active bleeding or high-risk procedures, thresholds that may optimize clot formation are hematocrit > 25%, platelet count > 50,000, and fibrinogen > 120 mg/dL, and commonly utilized thresholds for international normalized ratio correction are not supported by evidence; thrombopoietin agonists are a good alternative to platelet transfusion but require time (about 10 days) to elevate platelet levels; the utility of fresh frozen plasma is limited by large volume requirements and other drawbacks, and although the 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate offers a low-volume option, dosage is partly based on international normalized ratio (problematic in cirrhosis) and experience in liver disease is limited.

Utilization of pro-coagulants, including blood products — most hepatology practices in the past utilized fresh frozen plasma and pooled platelet transfusions to the exclusion of other agents, and it is worth reconsidering these practice patterns and incorporating other agents that have lower volume and risk while considering the immunologic and infectious risks of transfusion, volume administered, and risks for clotting.

### Guidelines for the use of fresh-frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate and cryosupernatant [^0cfc1ef5]. British Journal of Haematology (2004). Low credibility.

The indications for transfusing fresh-frozen plasma (FFP), cryoprecipitate and cryosupernatant plasma are very limited. When transfused they can have unpredictable adverse effects. The risks of transmitting infection are similar to those of other blood components unless a pathogen-reduced plasma (PRP) is used. Of particular concern are allergic reactions and anaphylaxis, transfusion-related acute lung injury, and haemolysis from transfused antibodies to blood group antigens, especially A and B. FFP is not indicated in disseminated intravascular coagulation without bleeding, is only recommended as a plasma exchange medium for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (for which cryosupernatant is a possible alternative), should never be used to reverse warfarin anticoagulation in the absence of severe bleeding, and has only a very limited place in prophylaxis prior to liver biopsy. When used for surgical or traumatic bleeding, FFP and cryoprecipitate doses should be guided by coagulation studies, which may include near-patient testing. FFP is not indicated to reverse vitamin K deficiency for neonates or patients in intensive care units. PRP may be used as an alternative to FFP. In the UK, PRP from countries with a low bovine spongiform encephalopathy incidence is recommended by the Departments of Health for children born after 1 January 1996. Arrangements for limited supplies of single donor PRP of non-UK origin are expected to be completed in 2004. Batched pooled commercially prepared PRP from donors in the USA (Octaplas) is licensed and available in the UK. FFP must be thawed using a technique that avoids risk of bacterial contamination. Plastic packs containing any of these plasma products are brittle in the frozen state and must be handled with care.

### AGA clinical practice update: coagulation in cirrhosis [^74de0bff]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Complications of blood product transfusions — fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelets — are listed across short-term, intermediate, and long-term horizons. Short-term complications include transfusion reactions, cross-match errors, prolonged ventilator time, exacerbation of portal hypertension, transfusion-related acute lung injury, increased mortality, infection transmission, and potential hypercoagulable complications (eg, portal vein thrombosis). Intermediate complications include increased intensive care unit stay, increased hospital length of stay, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, transfusion-related acute lung injury, and increased mortality. Long-term complications include HLA antibody formation, disease transmission, and increased mortality.

### Fresh frozen plasma: the most commonly prescribed hemostatic agent [^66077b50]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). Low credibility.

Although fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is one of the most commonly prescribed therapies in clinical practice throughout the world today, there is little medical evidence available supporting its use. Recent guidelines have called for limiting FFP transfusions. Despite this, FFP use does not seem to be decreasing. The reasons for this are likely to be multifactorial, and may be based on ideas regarding medical practices dating back to Galen and Hippocrates. A review of the history of the development of FFP may shed some light on current clinical practice and guide the direction of future investigations and therapies.

### Cryoprecipitate therapy [^fcd823e7]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Cryoprecipitate, originally developed as a therapy for patients with antihaemophilic factor deficiency, or haemophilia A, has been in use for almost 50 yr. However, cryoprecipitate is no longer administered according to its original purpose, and is now most commonly used to replenish fibrinogen levels in patients with acquired coagulopathy, such as in clinical settings with haemorrhage including cardiac surgery, trauma, liver transplantation (LT), or obstetric haemorrhage. Cryoprecipitate is a pooled product that does not undergo pathogen inactivation, and its administration has been associated with a number of adverse events, particularly transmission of blood-borne pathogens and transfusion-related acute lung injury. As a result of these safety concerns, along with emerging availability of alternative fibrinogen preparations, cryoprecipitate has been withdrawn from use in a number of European countries. Compared with the plasma from which it is prepared, cryoprecipitate contains a high concentration of coagulation factor VIII, coagulation factor XIII, and fibrinogen. Cryoprecipitate is usually licensed by regulatory authorities for the treatment of hypofibrinogenaemia, and recommended for supplementation when plasma fibrinogen levels decrease below 1 g litre(-1); however, this threshold is empiric and is not based on solid clinical evidence. Consequently, there is uncertainty over the appropriate dosing and optimal administration of cryoprecipitate, with some guidelines from professional societies to guide clinical practice. Randomized, controlled trials are needed to determine the clinical efficacy of cryoprecipitate, compared with the efficacy of alternative preparations. These trials will allow the development of evidence-based guidelines in order to inform physicians and guide clinical practice.

### Cryoprecipitate therapy [^944270e2]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Preparation

Each unit (U) of cryoprecipitate is commonly prepared from 1 unit of fresh frozen plasma (FFP; plasma which is frozen within 8 h of collection). FFP is thawed at 1–6°C and centrifuged to remove the supernatant. The remaining insoluble precipitate, which is enriched with clotting factors, is re-suspended in plasma and refrozen at −18°C or colder. Alternatively, cryoprecipitate can be made from FP24, plasma which is frozen within 24 h of collection.

Although cryoprecipitate is commonly believed to contain the majority of fibrinogen from plasma, in fact it contains only ∼32%; the rest remains in the cryosupernatant. However, because cryoprecipitate is re-suspended in a relatively small volume, it contains fibrinogen at a higher concentration than in plasma, although the actual concentration of fibrinogen in cryoprecipitate varies widely (∼3–30 g litre −1) because of variability between donors and institution-specific practices (Table 1). For example, one recent study measured the fibrinogen concentration of 11 different units of cryoprecipitate prepared in the same hospital; the concentrations per unit ranged from 3.2 to 8.2 g litre −1, with a mean concentration of 5.6 (1.7) g litre −1. Volume per unit was high, at 35–40 mL [mean fibrinogen content 195.3 (58.3) mg U −1].

Risks of blood product utilization in cirrhosis — blood product transfusion can be lifesaving, but the risks of exacerbating portal hypertension from volume expansion, bacterial and viral contamination, immunologic complications, and cost make it imperative to restrict their use whenever possible; serious complications include transfusion-related lung injury and development of HLA antibodies that can impact subsequent transplantation or impair the ability to receive further transfusions; transfusion-related lung injury rates increase with the number of transfusions and are higher when platelets or plasma-containing blood products are utilized.

### Prophylactic fresh frozen plasma and platelet transfusion have a prothrombotic effect in patients with liver disease [^6f1610d5]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Patients with liver disease frequently acquire complex alterations in their hemostatic system. Their conventional coagulation tests often show a prolonged international normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and/or low platelet counts, that historically were interpreted as implying an increased bleeding tendency. It is common clinical practice to correct these tests with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or platelet transfusions prior to invasive procedures. 1, 2 However, whether the prophylactic use of FFP and platelets in these patients is beneficial and truly indicated is increasingly debated. 3 This debate started after clinical and laboratory studies demonstrated patients with liver disease are not overtly coagulopathic, but rather characterized by a rebalanced hemostatic system, in which simultaneous changes in the pro‐ and antihemostatic factors result in a reset of the hemostatic balance. This balance, however, is less stable than the balance in people with intact liver function, and can be relatively easy tipped over to bleeding or thrombosis. 4

Bleeding is a particularly feared complication in patients with liver disease. Clinicians have long sought guidance on identifying which patients are at increased risk for bleeding complications and might need prophylactic blood product transfusion. However, bleeding is not necessarily related to failing hemostasis, but often related to portal hypertension or mechanical vascular injury, 5, 6 and standard diagnostic tests of hemostasis are poor predictors of bleeding risk. 7 Most recent guidelines therefore no longer recommend the use of conventional coagulation tests, such as the INR, in the assessment of bleeding risk in patients with liver disease. 8, 9, 10 The INR does not accurately reflect the hemostatic status of these patients because it is sensitive for procoagulant factors, but not for anticoagulant factors (which generally decrease to a similar extent). As a consequence, the INR overestimates the bleeding tendency in patients with liver disease. Despite the recommendations not to correct the INR with fresh frozen plasma, 8, 9, 10 threshold values for conventional coagulation tests (INR > 1.5) are often maintained by proceduralists in clinical practice, resulting in the frequent use of FFP transfusions before procedures. 1, 11

Hemostasis and coagulation in perioperative cirrhosis — The international normalized ratio (INR) is not predictive of bleeding in cirrhosis and "prophylactic" fresh frozen plasma is "not recommended"; studies indicate platelet counts "above 50,000/μL are adequate to allow clot formation", so prophylactic platelet transfusions to higher levels are "unlikely to be beneficial". For thrombocytopenia, "Only avatrombopag and lusutrombopag are approved" and were "effective in raising platelet counts above 50,000/μL", but "rates of bleeding events… were equivalent" to placebo and "thrombotic events have occurred", so they should be used "with caution", and it "would seem reasonable to consider their use" before elective high-risk procedures when baseline platelets are "less than 50,000/μL". Regarding fibrinogen, low levels are linked to bleeding and "levels < 100 mg/dL are associated with a risk of inhibiting clot formation"; "Fibrinogen can be replaced with low-volume cryoprecipitate", and "it seems physiologically reasonable to replete fibrinogen… before high-risk surgical procedures". If available, "viscoelastic testing… should be considered before and during surgical procedures" to guide transfusion strategy.

American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases practice guidance — bleeding risk and fibrinogen in cirrhosis notes that low fibrinogen levels have been associated with increased bleeding risk in critically ill patients with cirrhosis and that cryoprecipitate and fibrinogen factor replacements are low-volume products effective at increasing fibrinogen levels; concentrate before high-risk procedures could be considered for patients with cirrhosis, but data to support this strategy reducing bleeding complications are lacking, and levels of fibrinogen of < 100 mg/dL are rare in patients with cirrhosis outside of acute critical illness.

### British society of gastroenterology best practice guidance: outpatient management of cirrhosis-part 3: special circumstances [^0ec5f55f]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Correction of prolonged international normalised ratio (INR) with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is not recommended, even for high-risk procedures — in some cases plasma expansion can exacerbate PHTN and increase bleeding risk. Platelet infusion/thrombopoietin receptor (TPO-R) agonists are not recommended if platelets are > 50×10 9 or if bleeding can be treated by local haemostasis. For people with a platelet count < 50×10 9 undergoing high-risk procedures platelet transfusion/TPO-R agonists should not be required routinely but should be considered on a case-by-case basis, particularly if platelet count < 20×10 9.TPO-R agonist should be used with caution in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, and dose adjustments may be required. Consider discussing with haematology and refer to local protocols. If possible, haemoglobin, iron, folic acid and B 12 should be optimised prior to high-risk procedures.

### AGA clinical practice update: coagulation in cirrhosis [^03500742]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Fibrinogen in cirrhosis — risk assessment targets and replacement: Recently, fibrinogen levels have emerged as a predictor more meaningful than INR to couple with platelet levels as a measure of bleeding risk, although target levels (usually 120–150 mg/dL) have to be conjectured from trauma literature. When replacement of fibrinogen is desired, cryoprecipitate can be used, and because it is contained in a small volume and lacks anticoagulant proteins, and fibrinogen is synthesized in the liver with a half-life that is approximately 4 days in healthy individuals, which is shortened in cirrhosis.

### Clinical impact of choosing wisely Canada hepatology recommendations: an interrupted time-series analysis using data from GEMINI [^4345f54c]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

The evidence supporting routine prophylactic transfusion of FFP, platelets and vitamin K in cirrhosis patients undergoing minor invasive procedures is limited. The decision to transfuse blood products should be based on a careful assessment of the individual patient's bleeding risk and coagulation status. Following CWC Hepatology recommendations, we did not find a change in rates of FFP transfusions, platelet transfusions and vitamin K infusions in cirrhosis patients undergoing minor invasive procedures. There may have been existing practices of routinely administering blood products prophylactically, and decisions may be influenced by their familiarity and cumulative clinical experience. Additionally, it is plausible that the approach to prophylactic transfusions of blood products or vitamin K for cirrhosis patients can vary among physicians, potentially due to differing levels of comfort and familiarity with these practices. This variation may stem from the evolving evidence base and the complexity of managing coagulopathy in cirrhosis, which could lead to diverse clinical practices.

### Prophylactic fresh frozen plasma and platelet transfusion have a prothrombotic effect in patients with liver disease [^0153a468]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Most of the procedures that patients in this cohort underwent were associated with a low or intermediate bleeding risk, where current clinical guidance now advises against the use of prophylactic administration of blood products. 8, 9, 10, 14 It is important to note that the patients we studied represented only a small proportion of those undergoing such procedures, many of whom received no such support. Nonetheless, even in a specialized liver care center, some clinicians continue to administer blood products to selected patients with liver disease prior to low‐ or moderate‐risk procedures based on abnormal conventional coagulation tests. This illustrates the challenges in changing clinician behaviors of long standing, even when there is evidence that prophylactic transfusions are potentially harmful. 20, 21, 22 For example, transfusion of FFP may lead to volume overload and may exacerbate portal hypertension that could increase rather than prevent bleeding risk in these patients. 6 Here, we demonstrate potential prothrombotic effects of blood product transfusion. In addition, we found laboratory evidence of a potentially harmful inflammatory effect of platelet transfusion, which is in accordance with a previous study from our group that assessed inflammatory responses following platelet transfusion. 29 Adverse effects of blood product transfusion should be an integral part in the decision making of prophylactic blood product transfusion in patients with liver disease.

In conclusion, administration of FFP and platelet transfusion in a real‐life clinical setting resulted in a prothrombotic effect in some but not all patients with chronic liver disease. However, many of the transfusions were not indicated based on recent guidance documents, and it is questionable whether these transfusions had a clinically relevant effect. Our results do suggest that blood product transfusions may be useful in improving hemostatic status in some high‐risk procedures or actively bleeding patients.

### ACG clinical guideline: disorders of the hepatic and mesenteric circulation [^da9df041]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Cirrhosis — bleeding risk assessment and prophylactic plasma: International normalized ratio (INR) correlates poorly with thrombin generation and bleeding risk in cirrhosis, and conventional fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) dosing does not effectively correct coagulopathy while posing risks. There is poor correlation between INR and thrombin production, and INR correlates poorly with thrombin generation and risk of bleeding. FFP commonly given as 2–4 units is rarely able to achieve a target INR of 1.5 or less, and in vitro mixing at 10 mL/kg lowers PT without enhancing thrombin generation. High-volume plasma infusions can raise portal pressure in the range of 15–20 mm Hg, whereas paracentesis without prophylactic FFP is reported safe even with INR as high as 8.7. Accordingly, we do not recommend FFP to improve thrombin generation at conventional doses (10–15 mL/kg), and in most situations prophylactic plasma to decrease bleeding risk is futile and potentially risky (conditional recommendation, low level of evidence).

### A critical evaluation of cryoprecipitate for replacement of fibrinogen [^a8d1b728]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

Maintaining the plasma fibrinogen concentration is important to limit excessive perioperative blood loss. This article considers the evidence for this statement, and questions the justification for using cryoprecipitate rather than virus-inactivated fibrinogen concentrate to support plasma fibrinogen levels. Haemophilia was historically treated with cryoprecipitate, but specific coagulation factor concentrates are now preferred. In contrast, primary fractions of allogeneic donor blood, including cryoprecipitate, are still commonly used to treat perioperative bleeding. When compared with cryoprecipitate and fresh-frozen plasma (FFP), freeze-dried fibrinogen concentrate offers standardized fibrinogen content, faster reconstitution and improved efficacy. Pasteurization and purification processes employed in the preparation of fibrinogen concentrate reduce the risk of pathogen transmission and immune-mediated complications, in comparison with cryoprecipitate and FFP. When all costs associated with administration are taken into consideration, the cost of fibrinogen concentrate is not substantially different to that of cryoprecipitate. In conclusion, wider availability and use of fibrinogen concentrate may improve the management of perioperative bleeding. Further benefits may accrue from more rapid and accurate techniques for monitoring fibrinogen levels. Clinical studies are needed to evaluate methods of measuring fibrinogen and assessing fibrin polymerization, and to define critical haemostatic plasma fibrinogen concentrations in different perioperative situations.

### Thromboelastography-guided blood component use in patients with cirrhosis with nonvariceal bleeding: a randomized controlled trial [^72aebea5]. Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Thromboelastography (TEG) provides a more comprehensive global coagulation assessment than routine tests (international normalized ratio [INR] and platelet [PLT] count), and its use may avoid unnecessary blood component transfusion in patients with advanced cirrhosis and significant coagulopathy who have nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. A total of 96 patients with significant coagulopathy (defined in this study as INR > 1.8 and/or PLT count < 50 × 10 9 /L) and nonvariceal upper GI bleed (diagnosed after doing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, which showed ongoing bleed from a nonvariceal source) were randomly allocated to TEG-guided transfusion strategy (TEG group; n = 49) or standard-of-care (SOC) group (n = 47). In the TEG group, only 26.5% patients were transfused with all three blood components (fresh frozen plasma [FFP], PLTs, and cryoprecipitate) versus 87.2% in the SOC group (P < 0.001). Although 7 (14.3%) patients in the TEG group received no blood component transfusion, there were no such patients in the SOC group (P = 0.012). Also, there was a significantly lower use of blood components (FFP, PLTs, and cryoprecipitate) in the TEG group compared with the SOC group. Failure to control bleed, failure to prevent rebleeds, and mortality between the two groups were similar. Conclusion: In patients with advanced cirrhosis with coagulopathy and nonvariceal upper GI bleeding, TEG-guided transfusion strategy leads to a significantly lower use of blood components compared with SOC (transfusion guided by INR and PLT count), without an increase in failure to control bleed, failure to prevent rebleed, and mortality.

### Fresh frozen plasma transfusion in patients with cirrhosis and coagulopathy: effect on conventional coagulation tests and thrombomodulin-modified thrombin generation [^fc2d60fe]. Journal of Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

The efficacy of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusion in enhancing thrombin generation in patients with cirrhosis and impaired conventional coagulation tests has not been sufficiently explored. Thus, we aimed to assess the effect of FFP transfusion on thrombin generation in these patients.

Methods

Fifty-three consecutive patients receiving a standard dose of FFP to treat bleeding and/or before invasive procedures - if international normalized ratio (INR)/prothrombin time (PT) ratio were ≥ 1.5 - were prospectively enrolled. The primary endpoint was the amelioration of endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) with thrombomodulin (ETP-TM) after transfusion, which corresponds to the total amount of generated thrombin. INR/PT ratio and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) were also assessed before and after transfusion.

Results

FFP enhanced ETP-TM by 5.7%, from 973 (731–1,258) to 1,028 (885–1,343 nM × min; p = 0.019). Before transfusion, evidence of normal or high ETP-TM was found in 94% of patients, even in those with bacterial infections. Only 1 (1.9%) patient had ETP-TM values reverting to the normal range after transfusion. Notably, no patients with low ETP-TM had bleeding. The median decrease in ETP-TM was 8.3% and the mean was 12.8% in 18 (34%) patients after transfusion (from 1,225 [1,071–1,537] to 1,124 [812–1,370] nM × min; p ≤ 0.0001). Similar responses to FFP transfusion were observed in patients with compensated and acute decompensated cirrhosis, acute-on-chronic liver failure, infection or shock. FFP significantly ameliorated INR and aPTT values (p < 0.0001), but in a minority of patients the values were reduced to less than the cut-off point of 1.5.

Conclusions

FFP transfusion enhanced thrombin generation and ameliorated conventional coagulation tests to normal values in a limited number of patients, and slightly decreased thrombin generation in 34% of cases.

Lay Summary

Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma in patients with cirrhosis only slightly improves coagulation test values in a limited number of patients and even appears to worsen them in a third of cases. Transfusion for the purpose of preventing or treating bleeding events could cause inherent risks and costs without clear benefits.

### Procedural bleeding risk, rather than conventional coagulation tests, predicts procedure related bleeding in cirrhosis [^2fde9c7a]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Standard coagulation parameters are used to guide prophylactic blood product transfusion prior to invasive procedures in cirrhotic patients despite limited high-quality evidence.

Aims

We aimed to describe coagulation parameters and prophylactic blood product use in cirrhotic patients having invasive procedures, and the influence of both on periprocedural bleeding.

Methods

We conducted a cohort study of cirrhotic patients undergoing invasive procedures at a referral hospital. Procedures were classified into low or moderate-high bleeding risk. Prophylactic blood component was defined as fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate or platelet transfusion prior to procedures. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with procedure-related bleeding.

Results

We identified 566 procedures in 233 cirrhotic patients. Prophylactic blood product was given before 16% of high-risk and 11% of low-risk procedures (P = 0.18). Eight (8.3%) high-risk procedures were complicated by postprocedural bleeding, six of which occurred in patients without significant coagulopathy. The bleeding rate for low-risk procedures was 0.4%. For patients with international normalized ratio > 1.5, platelet count < 50 x 109/L, or both, the rate of bleeding was comparable between those given and not given prophylactic blood products (3.1 vs. 1.9%; P = 0.63). After adjusting for age, sex, platelet count, international normalized ratio, acute kidney injury, sepsis and model of end-stage liver disease, the only factor significantly predicting procedure-related bleeding was the procedural bleeding risk category (P < 0.01).

Conclusions

Procedure-related bleeding in cirrhotic patients cannot be accurately predicted by INR or platelet count, nor prevented by blood component prophylaxis using these parameters. Procedure-related bleeding is best predicted by the bleeding risk status of procedures.

### ACG clinical guideline: disorders of the hepatic and mesenteric circulation [^367a8123]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

ACG clinical guideline — bleeding and thrombotic risk in liver disorders advises against prophylactic fresh frozen plasma (FFP) in cirrhosis at conventional doses (10 mL/kg); if sufficient volume is given (1–2 L) to lower INR, portal pressure may rise and variceal hemorrhage may be triggered, and infusion of plasma prophylactically to decrease bleeding risk is "futile and potentially risky" (conditional recommendation). In cirrhosis, routine prophylactic platelet transfusion before common procedures is not recommended outside of "significant renal dysfunction (serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL) or sepsis"; in vitro studies show adequate thrombin production with platelet levels ≥ 50,000/mL and a single adult platelet dose does not improve thrombin generation, with TPO agonists potentially more appropriate for elective high‑risk procedures (conditional recommendation). For persistent active bleeding, the guideline states "we do not recommend antifibrinolytic agents" such as epsilon aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid in the absence of hyperfibrinolysis and cautions use if pathological clot such as portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is present (conditional recommendation).

### Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma and platelets in critically ill adults: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^aa9caf1b]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Justification

No RCT data were found on the prophylactic use of blood products prior to endoscopy. Two retrospective studies explored the effects of platelet transfusion or INR correction before GI-endoscopy in patients with active variceal bleeding. Biswas et alstudied 913 patients by developing cohorts based on platelet levels (< 20, 20–50, and > 50 × 10 9 /L) and examining whether or not patients received platelet transfusions. Mohanty et alretrospectively assessed 244 patients with variceal bleeding comparing those treated with FFP with those who were not. Patients receiving FFP had a significantly higher INR that those who did not receive treatment (1.97 vs 1.45; P < .0001). Higher mortality and rebleeding rates were noted in those transfused with platelets or FFP. Moreover, rescue transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt occurred more frequently in patients who received FFP. However, transfused patients generally were older and had higher rates of hemodynamic instability, renal dysfunction, and more severe liver disease at baseline. The unfavorable clinical outcomes were likely related to the severity of illness rather than adverse transfusion effects. No data exist on the impact of prophylactic transfusion on 30-day mortality, major bleeding, and ICU LOS.

Given the low risk of GI-endoscopy without biopsy causing further bleeding, the multiple confounders, and the uncertain risk attributable to transfusions, the evidence suggests not routinely transfusing platelets or FFP.

In the ICU, endoscopy is primarily performed for active hemorrhage, focusing on hemostatic interventions. Therefore, the decision to transfuse patients with active GI bleeding undergoing endoscopy should rely on clinical need rather than procedural risk. For instance, post-polypectomy bleeding rates are < 1%. Even in severe cases such as variceal bleeding, endoscopy is unlikely to worsen bleeding, making transfusion generally unnecessary for improving the safety of the procedure.

What Others Are Saying

Our recommendations for GI-endoscopy align with other societies that advise against INR correction in variceal hemorrhage and deem it reasonable to perform GI-endoscopy without prophylactic platelet transfusion. These statements consider the risks, lack of benefit from prophylactic FFP transfusions, and the weak evidence supporting platelet transfusions. An individualized approach is recommended for patients with severe thrombocytopenia.

Research Priorities

Studies evaluating viscoelastic blood testing to guide product administration are underway.

### AGA clinical practice update: coagulation in cirrhosis [^3e45ba34]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Description

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership. The intent is to evaluate the current data on mechanism of altered coagulation in patients with cirrhosis, provide guidance on the use of currently available testing of the coagulation cascade, and help practitioners use anticoagulation and pro-coagulants appropriately in patients with cirrhosis.

Methods

This review is framed around the best practice points, which were derived from the most impactful publications in the area of coagulation in cirrhosis and agreed to by all authors. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Global tests of clot formation, such as rotational thromboelastometry, thromboelastography, sonorheometry, and thrombin generation, may eventually have a role in the evaluation of clotting in patients with cirrhosis, but currently lack validated target levels. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: In general, clinicians should not routinely correct thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy before low-risk therapeutic paracentesis, thoracentesis, and routine upper endoscopy for variceal ligation in patients with hepatic synthetic dysfunction-induced coagulation abnormalities. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Blood products should be used sparingly because they increase portal pressure and carry a risk of transfusion-associated circulatory overload, transfusion-related acute lung injury, infection transmission, alloimmunization, and/or transfusion reactions. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: The following transfusion thresholds for management of active bleeding or high-risk procedures may optimize clot formation in advanced liver disease: hematocrit ≥ 25%, platelet count > 50,000, and fibrinogen > 120 mg/dL. Commonly utilized thresholds for international normalized ratio correction are not supported by evidence. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Thrombopoietin agonists are a good alternative to platelet transfusion, but require time (about 10 days) to elevate platelet levels. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: The large volume of fresh frozen plasma required to reach an arbitrary international normalized ratio target, limitations of the usual target, minimal effect on thrombin generation, and adverse effects on portal pressure limit the utility of this agent significantly. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: The 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate contains both pro- and anticoagulant factors that offer an attractive low-volume therapeutic to rebalance a disturbed hemostatic system. However, dosage is, in part, based on international normalized ratio, which is problematic in cirrhosis, and published experience in liver disease is limited. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Anti-fibrinolytic therapy may be considered in patients with persistent bleeding from mucosal oozing or puncture wound bleeding consistent with impaired clot integrity. Both ε-aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid inhibit clot dissolution. Neither is believed to generate a hypercoagulable state, although both may exacerbate pre-existing thrombi. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Desmopressin releases von Willebrand factor as its primary hemostatic mechanism. As this factor is usually elevated in cirrhosis, the agent lacks a sound evidence-based foundation, but may be useful in patients with concomitant renal failure. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Systemic heparin infusion is recommended for symptomatic deep vein thrombosis and portal and mesenteric vein thrombosis, but there are unresolved issues regarding monitoring with both the anti-Xa assay and the partial thromboplastin time due to cirrhosis-related antithrombin deficiency (heparin cofactor). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Treatment of incidental portal and mesenteric vein thrombosis depends on estimated impact on transplantation surgical complexity vs risks of bleeding and falls. Therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin, vitamin K antagonists, and direct-acting anticoagulants improve portal vein repermeation vs observation alone. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Direct-acting anticoagulants, such as the factor Xa and thrombin inhibitors, are relatively safe and effective in stable cirrhotic patients, but are in need of further study in patients with more advanced liver disease.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Cirrhosis occurs when scar tissue replaces normal liver tissue, causing permanent liver damage. Less common causes of cirrhosis include hepatitis B infection, diseases that cause buildup of iron or copper in the liver, diseases that cause bile duct destruction, α1 antitrypsin deficiency, and autoimmune hepatitis. Signs and Symptoms of Cirrhosis. Hepatorenal syndrome: kidney failure caused by cirrhosis Hepatocellular carcinoma: liver cancer, which affects 1% to 4% of patients with cirrhosis How Is Cirrhosis Diagnosed. Cirrhosis can be diagnosed by elastography, a noninvasive test that measures liver stiffness, or by biopsy of the liver. Some patients are first diagnosed when they develop a complication of cirrhosis, such as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, or hepatocellular carcinoma.

Treatments for Cirrhosis and Its Complications Ascites is typically treated with medications. Fluid removal with a needle or catheter provides temporary relief for patients who have a large amount of fluid buildup that is causing abdominal discomfort. Treatment of hepatic encephalopathy includes medications and a high-protein diet. The risk of variceal bleeding is reduced with medications that decrease pressure in the veins, and patients with variceal bleeding have improved 1-year survival if a stent is placed in the liver by a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedure. Although cirrhosis is rarely reversible, treatment of the underlying condition can prevent further progression. Abstinence from alcohol is recommended for all patients with cirrhosis due to alcohol use disorder.

Patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease should receive nutritional counseling, medical weight loss treatments, and, in certain cases, weight loss surgery. Hepatitis C and hepatitis B infection should be treated with antiviral medications. Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma with an abdominal ultrasound and blood testing for α-fetoprotein every 6 months can lead to early detection and increased cure rates if liver cancer is detected. Evaluation for liver transplant should be considered for patients with complications of cirrhosis.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fourth edition [^2d8e89d5]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Rationale

Plasma (thawed FFP or pathogen-inactivated plasma) is used for many years and throughout the world as a source of coagulation factors. FFP contains about 70% of the normal level of all clotting factors; therefore, it would seem to be an adequate source for replacement; however, different preparations show great variability. We recommend the use of FFP if a plasma-based coagulation strategy is applied and there is evidence of coagulation factor deficiency as evidenced by a prolonged PT and APTT greater than 1.5 times the normal control or viscoelastic measures. RCTs that investigate the utility of this approach have never been conducted, however this strategy is widely applied. Management of haemorrhage should be carefully monitored to ensure that FFP transfusion is appropriate, as it is associated with significant risks, including circulatory overload, allergic reactions and TRALI.

A prolongation of "clotting time" or "reaction time" using viscoelastic tests may also be considered an indication for the administration of FFP, however the scientific evidence for this is scarce and a normalisation of fibrinogen level as described in recommendation 28 will often normalise these parameters.

Fibrinogen and cryoprecipitate

Recommendation 28

If a concentrate-based strategy is used, we recommend treatment with fibrinogen concentrate or cryoprecipitate if significant bleeding is accompanied by viscoelastic signs of a functional fibrinogen deficit or a plasma fibrinogen level of less than 1.5–2.0 g/l. (Grade 1C)

We suggest an initial fibrinogen supplementation of 3–4 g. This is equivalent to 15–20 single donor units of cryoprecipitate or 3–4 g fibrinogen concentrate. Repeat doses must be guided by viscoelastic monitoring and laboratory assessment of fibrinogen levels. (Grade 2C)

### Practical management of major blood loss [^cbbad994]. Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of bleeding, regardless of cause, is complex and ill understood. For traumatic or sudden unexpected haemorrhage, the use of transfusion packs with red cells, fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate and platelets being given in ratios of between 1:1 and 1:3 seems reasonable. This removes the requirement for 'wait and see tests' and should be part of an overall resuscitation and stabilisation plan that may improve outcome following sudden haemorrhage. The replacement of fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate with low-volume, targeted concentrates is attractive. There is increasing evidence for the efficacy and safety of fibrinogen concentrates as a single agent. The combination of fibrinogen and prothrombin complex concentrates could be powerful and has the possibility to the management of bleeding and improve outcome in patients but, as yet, remains unproven.

### Vascular liver disorders, portal vein thrombosis, and procedural bleeding in patients with liver disease: 2020 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^f3d15e7e]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Procedural bleeding risk assessment in cirrhosis — international normalized ratio (INR), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and recombinant factor VIIa: The INR should not be used to gauge procedural bleeding risk in patients with cirrhosis who are not taking vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), and measures aimed at reducing the INR are not recommended before procedures in patients with cirrhosis who are not taking VKAs. Given the lack of effect of FFP on hemostatic capacity in cirrhosis, the authors advise against prophylactic FFP transfusion before common procedures, and FFP transfusion before procedures is associated with risks and no proven benefits. Recombinant factor VIIa use in a prophylactic setting before invasive procedures is not recommended and has been associated with increased risks of thrombosis, including arterial thromboses, while prothrombin complex concentrates are under study in liver disease but efficacy and safety data are lacking to date.

Essentials

Abnormalities in standard coagulation tests in patients with liver disease are commonly corrected with blood product transfusions prior to invasive procedures. Whether these transfusions are truly indicated is increasingly debated.
In this observational cohort study, we assessed the hemostatic status of patients with liver disease before and after transfusions.
Blood product transfusion had a prothrombotic effect, as evidenced by increased thrombin generation, in vivo activation of coagulation and platelet counts following transfusion.

Introduction

The concept of rebalanced hemostasis in cirrhosis challenges the policy of transfusing plasma or platelets before invasive procedures in patients with prolonged PT or severe thrombocytopenia. Recent guidelines recommend against plasma transfusion and suggest avoiding/minimizing platelet transfusions.

Aim

We assessed how hepato-gastroenterologists manage prolonged PT/INR or severe thrombocytopenia before invasive procedures.

Methods

On May 2021, AISF members were sent a questionnaire addressing the PT/INR and platelet thresholds required before invasive procedures, the use of other markers of bleeding risk or other hemostatic treatments and the burden of pre-emptive plasma and platelet transfusions.

Results

Of 62 respondents, 94% and 100% use PT/INR and platelet count to assess bleeding risk, respectively. Only 37% and 32% require less conservative PT/INR or platelet counts thresholds for low-risk procedures, respectively. As for those applying single thresholds, 68% require PT/INR < 1,5 and 86% require platelet counts ≥ 50 × 10 9 /L. Half respondents use additional indicators of bleeding risk and 63% other hemostatic treatments. Low-risk procedures account for 70% of procedures, and for 50% and 59% of plasma and platelets units transfused, respectively.

Conclusions

the survey indicates lack of compliance with guidelines that advise against plasma and platelet transfusions before invasive procedures and the need for prospective studies and inter-society consensus workshops.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Patient characteristics and procedural variables

From June 2019 to December 2019, a total of 19 patients with chronic liver disease and a prolonged INR that received prophylactic FFP transfusion before an invasive procedure were included in this study. In that same period, 13 patients with thrombocytopenia that received prophylactic platelet transfusion were included in this study. The decision to administer FFP or platelets was made by the treating clinical team. Patient characteristics and details of procedures and blood products transfused are summarized in Table 1. All patients underwent low‐ to intermediate‐risk procedures, as defined by expert consensus. 26 In the FFP group, 53% of the patients underwent low‐risk procedures and 47% underwent intermediate‐risk procedures, of which all except for one were transjugular liver biopsies. Of the patients receiving platelet transfusion, 62% and 38% of the patients underwent low‐ and intermediate‐risk procedures, respectively. We took blood samples before and after blood product transfusion and aimed to take the second blood sample before initiation of the procedure. However, because this was a clinical observational study in a real‐life setting, in which we did not intervene with clinical care, 9/19 and 3/13 of the second blood samples in the FFP and platelet concentrate group, respectively, were taken during or after the procedure.

### Thrombelastography-guided blood product use before invasive procedures in cirrhosis with severe coagulopathy: a randomized, controlled trial [^f24185d2]. Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Bleeding is a feared complication of invasive procedures in patients with cirrhosis and significant coagulopathy (as defined by routine coagulation tests) and is used to justify preprocedure use of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and/or platelets (PLT). Thromboelastography (TEG) provides a more comprehensive global coagulation assessment than routine tests (international normalized ratio [INR] and platelet count), and its use may avoid unnecessary blood product transfusion in patients with cirrhosis and significant coagulopathy (defined in this study as INR > 1.8 and/or platelet count < 50 × 10(9) /L) who will be undergoing an invasive procedure. Sixty patients were randomly allocated to TEG-guided transfusion strategy or standard of care (SOC; 1:1 TEG:SOC). The TEG group would receive FFP if the reaction time (r) was > 40 min and/or PLT if maximum amplitude (MA) was < 30 mm. All SOC patients received FFP and/or PLT per hospital guidelines. Endpoints were blood product use and bleeding complications. Baseline characteristics of the two groups were similar. Per protocol, all subjects in the SOC group received blood product transfusions versus 5 in the TEG group (100% vs. 16.7%; P < 0.0001). Sixteen SOC (53.3%) received FFP, 10 (33.3%) PLT, and 4 (13.3%) both FFP and PLT. In the TEG group, none received FFP alone (P < 0.0001 vs. SOC), 2 received PLT (6.7%; P = 0.009 vs. SOC), and 3 both FFP and PLT (not significant). Postprocedure bleeding occurred in only 1 patient (SOC group) after large-volume paracentesis.

Conclusions

In patients with cirrhosis and significant coagulopathy before invasive procedures, TEG-guided transfusion strategy leads to a significantly lower use of blood products compared to SOC (transfusion guided by INR and platelet count), without an increase in bleeding complications. Remarkably, even in patients with significant coagulopathy, postprocedure bleeding was rare, indicating that TEG thresholds should be reevaluated.

GI bleeding

Bleeding oesophageal and gastric varices are another important complication of cirrhosis with a high mortality rate. A recent UK-wide audit showed the overall 30-days mortality was 15% for patients with acute variceal bleeding, with higher mortality rates in subjects with more advanced cirrhosis. Airway protection is vital, particularly in patients with encephalopathy or massive GI bleeding to reduce the risk of aspiration. In patients with known varices or portal hypertension, upper GI bleeding should be regarded as variceal until proven otherwise, although a significant proportion will have non-variceal bleeding. Patients should be fluid-resuscitated according to pulse and blood pressure, aiming for a mean arterial pressure of > 65 mm Hg. Transfusion of red blood cells is indicated when the haemoglobin (Hb) falls below 7 g/dLaiming for an Hb of 8 g/dL. It has been recently shown that a restrictive blood transfusion strategy (transfuse when Hb < 7 g/dL) had lower mortality compared with a liberal strategy of transfusion (transfuse when Hb < 9 g/dL) in patients with cirrhosis and with GI bleeding. The liberal strategy also increased the portal pressure over 5 days, thus increasing the potential for rebleeding. Coagulation abnormalities are common in patients with cirrhosis and may require correction in patients with active bleeding. Although not evaluated in randomised controlled trials, correction of blood clotting abnormalities is recommended by NICE when the international normalised ratio (INR) is > 1.5 (fresh frozen plasma), platelet count is < 50×10 9 /L (platelets) or fibrinogen < 1.0 g/L (cryoprecipitate). Consider giving intravenous vitamin K in patients with cirrhosis and with a prolonged prothrombin time, as vitamin K deficiency is common due to malnutrition and chronic cholestasis.

Certainty of the evidence and clinical implications — The certainty of evidence was very low across all outcomes due to indirectness and few events. Data suggest baseline bleeding risk for common nonsurgical procedures is low in cirrhosis, and there are insufficient data to justify cutoffs of standard coagulation parameters. The technical review stratified procedure-related bleeding risk into low or high using a threshold of 1.5%. In patients with severe thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy undergoing high-risk procedures, decisions about prophylactic blood transfusions should include potential benefits and risks, the threshold for severe thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy could not be clearly defined and remains a matter of clinical judgment, and in many cases care should be managed in collaboration with an expert hematologist.

Coagulation interventions and factor assessment in cirrhosis highlight that the international normalized ratio (INR) does not predict bleeding risk and that certain corrective measures have limited utility or risks: "it is not a reliable indicator of hemostatic balance in patients with cirrhosis and is unable to predict procedural bleeding risk". Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusions "carry important risks: (1) a potential for developing transfusion-related lung injury syndromes and (2) increases in portal pressures directly proportional to the volume transfused" and "show minimal efficacy in improving thrombin generation capacity in vitro". Outside of advanced malnutrition or cholestasis, "vitamin K replacement has no measurable effect on the INR in patients with cirrhosis", and "Determination of factor V levels can aid the practitioner in differentiating vitamin K deficiency from impaired liver function".

Results

Studies included

The selection process and study flow are depicted in Figure 1. The majority of identified citations were easily excluded at the level of title or abstract on the basis of no relevance to this review. After screening, there were 91 studies that fulfilled our eligibility criteria, reported outcomes of interest and were formally included in the analysis (Tables 1, 2 and 3). There was also one meta-analysis that was used as supportive evidence. Only a minority of selected studies (n = 18) were high-quality prospective studies with randomisation procedures and a control arm (Table 4). A further 39 nonrandomised and observational studies with a comparator group were included. The majority (62%) of FFP studies involved the comparison of the intervention group against a different dosage (typically by assessing the effect of different FFP:RBC ratios), formulation (various kinds of 'pathogen-reduced' plasmas) or blood product (for example, cryoprecipitate or whole blood). There were only 20 studies in which FFP was compared with no FFP or with a non blood product (for example, colloid or crystalloid). There were five fibrinogen concentrate comparator studies, two comparing fibrinogen concentrate with no fibrinogen concentrate or with a non blood product and, importantly, three studies comparing the effect of fibrinogen concentrate directly with FFP (administered in combination with other allogeneic products).

### How I approach bleeding in hospitalized patients [^5e012832]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

In severe liver disease, fibrinogen may be low because of decreased synthesis in the setting of compromised liver function. Levels may also be decreased in the setting of ongoing consumption because of bleeding or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). In addition, plasma hyperfibrinolysis may be observed. Fibrinogen levels may be raised with cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen concentrate but an optimal goal level is not defined in liver disease. In the setting of DIC or acute bleeding, management may be dictated by guidelines for these disorders (goal typically ≥ 100 mg/dL). Tranexamic acid (TXA) is contraindicated in the setting of DIC. In patients with acute bleeding and without DIC, TXA may be considered, although a randomized, controlled trial of a high-dose 24-hour infusion of TXA failed to demonstrate a reduction in death due to bleeding among patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding. The trial also demonstrated a slight increase in venous thromboembolic risk, although overall risk was low (0.8% vs 0.4%; relative risk, 1.85; 95% confidence interval, 1.15–2.98). Of note, in general, TXA has not been associated with an increased risk of thrombosis in any study with a typical dosing (1000 mg intravenously every 8 hours or 1300 mg orally every 8 hours).

Management of acute bleeding or around procedures in patients with coagulopathy associated with liver disease must be driven by patient presentation, given only few data based on laboratory analyses provide other guidance. However, the use of thromboelastography (TEG) to guide factor repletion in liver transplant surgery has been shown to reduce red blood cell and plasma transfusion volumes.TEG has also effectively demonstrated, what is believed to be, the rebalanced hemostatic picture in compensated cirrhosis and thus may be the best available assessment of overall hemostatic balance in liver disease. Although TEG is not universally available in all hospitals, it is available in virtually all transplant centers, which may be the ideal setting for patients such as the one described in case 1, where it may serve to provide reassurance of rebalanced hemostasis and prevent circulatory overload and/or increased risk of thromboembolism from traditional, INR-based transfusion strategies.

### Comparison of three transfusion protocols prior to central venous catheterization in patients with cirrhosis: a randomized controlled trial [^8c8c616b]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Transfusion of blood components prior to invasive procedures in cirrhosis patients is high and associated with adverse events.

Objectives

We compared three transfusion strategies prior to central venous catheterization in cirrhosis patients.

Patients/Methods

Single center randomized trial that included critically ill cirrhosis patients with indication for central venous line in a tertiary private hospital in Brazil.

Interventions

Restrictive protocol, thromboelastometry-guided protocol, or usual care (based on coagulogram). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients transfused with any blood component (ie, fresh frozen plasma, platelets, or cryoprecipitate). The secondary endpoints included incidence of bleeding and transfusion-related adverse events.

Results

A total of 57 patients (19 per group; 64.9% male; mean age, 53.4 ± 11.3 years) were enrolled. Prior to catheterization, 3/19 (15.8%) in the restrictive arm, 13/19 (68.4%) in the thromboelastometry-guided arm, and 14/19 (73.7%) in the coagulogram-guided arm received blood transfusion (odds ratio [OR], 0.07; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01–0.45; P = 0.002 for restrictive versus coagulogram-guided arm; OR, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01–0.56; P = 0.006 for restrictive versus thromboelastometry-guided arm; and OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.14–4.15; P = 0.931 for thromboelastometry-guided versus coagulogram-guided arm). The restrictive protocol was cost saving. No difference in bleeding, length of stay, mortality, and transfusion-related adverse events was found.

Conclusions

The use of a restrictive strategy is associated with a reduction in transfusion prior to central venous catheterization and costs in critically ill cirrhosis patients. No effect on bleeding was found among the groups.

Evidence summary

In massively bleeding cirrhotic patients, based on two RCTs, there was uncertainty as to the effects of the implementation of viscoelastic on mortality (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.59–1.13, low certainty), rebleeding (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.47–1.07, very low certainty), transfusion associated cardiac overload (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.18–1.3, low certainty) and red cell transfusion (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.67–1.68, low certainty). In these trials, there was evidence that the use of viscoelastic testing may reduce transfusion associated lung injury (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.11–0.56, low certainty), acute respiratory distress syndrome (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01–0.81, low certainty), platelet transfusion (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.05–0.43, low certainty) and fresh frozen plasma transfusion (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11–0.77, low certainty).

In massively bleeding liver transplant patients, based on the evidence pooled from a Cochrane Systematic review and an observational study, there was uncertainty as to the effects of viscoelastic on mortality (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.13–3.4, low certainty), red cell transfusion (MD − 12.22, 95% CI − 71.08 to 46.64, very low certainty) and platelet transfusion (MD − 2.8, − 14.92 to 9.32, very low certainty). There was, however, evidence that elastic may result in less blood loss (MD -1.13, 95% CI − 1.85 to − 0.41, very low certainty) and FFP Transfusion (MD − 8.7, 95% CI − 16.3 to − 1.1, very low certainty) in massively bleeding liver transplant patients.

In massively bleeding critically ill trauma patients, in a randomised trial, the use of viscoelastic testing did not result in a significant mortality reduction (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.29–1.02, very low certainty).

### Clinical effectiveness of fresh frozen plasma compared with fibrinogen concentrate: a systematic review [^f730d4da]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Fresh frozen plasma

A total of 19 comparator studies reported 22 outcomes of the effect of FFP on allogeneic transfusion requirements. These requirements were reported as intraoperative, postoperative or total (studies in which the requirements were reported for the whole perioperative period). Of these studies, only five showed some benefit for FFP over the comparator group, with the majority of the studies finding no effect and two studies reporting an increase in allogeneic transfusion requirements in the groups receiving FFP (Table 6).

Table 6
Evidence for the effect of each intervention on allogeneic transfusions

FFP = fresh frozen plasma; RCT = randomised, controlled trial; - = no data. Allogeneic products are defined as any combination of packed red blood cells, FFP, platelets and/or cryoprecipitate.

Seven studies investigated the effect of FFP compared with a non blood product (for example, colloid and/or crystalloid). Six of these showed no difference in the intraoperative, postoperative or total requirements (requirements were measured as either RBC or any allogeneic product and excluded the study dose of FFP). A block-RCT of coronary artery bypass graft surgery patients compared those who received 4 U of FFP intraoperatively with controls who received hydroxyethyl starch (HES). The study showed that transfusion requirements for RBC were significantly higher (both intra- and postoperatively) among those patients receiving FFP compared with patients administered HES. A further (paediatric) study also found that a greater proportion of patients in the FFP group required postoperative transfusions compared with those not receiving FFP. Two studies that compared FFP with 'pathogen-reduced' plasma showed no differences between groups in the total requirements for allogeneic transfusion.

### Treatment of bleeding in patients with liver disease [^6a7f1aad]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

There is no definitive evidence that correction of thrombocytopenia, a prolonged PT, or abnormal TEG or ROTEM tests by infusion of FFP, platelet concentrates, or low volume coagulation factor concentrates is effective at achieving a more rapid hemostasis. There are no clinical studies evaluating adequate platelet thresholds for the purpose of enhancing hemostasis in the bleeding cirrhosis patient. Furthermore, transfusions with platelet concentrates are frequently complicated by febrile reactions and less commonly by potentially life‐threatening transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI) and transfusion associated circulatory overload (TACO). Importantly, the risk of TRALI appears to be increased in patients with underlying liver disease. Platelet concentrates have been dose‐dependently associated with increased mortality in the setting of liver transplantation. Similarly, there is no evidence of benefit of FFP, but transfusion‐related side effects have significant potential to harm the patient with cirrhosis. In addition, the large volumes of FFP realistically needed to improve the INR makes transfusion of FFP very likely more harmful than beneficial in the treatment of variceal bleeding. Therefore, in the cirrhosis population, the use of FFP during acute variceal bleeding cannot be recommended. Lower volume factor replacements like the prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC) and rVIIa are more effective than FFP in decreasing INR values in cirrhosisand do not carry the risk of volume overload. However, their use in acute variceal bleeding has not been adequately studied and could theoretically increase thrombotic risk.

### Clinical application of thromboelastography in patients with cirrhosis: a single center experience [^df6ee5d1]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thromboelastography (TEG) is a functional test of coagulation used to guide transfusions. Despite literature supporting its utility, its use remains limited to select populations. In patients with cirrhosis, conventional coagulation tests are notoriously inaccurate, and TEG may be a better measure of coagulopathy. We aimed to assess the utilization of TEG in patients with cirrhosis to steward blood transfusions in this high-risk group.

Methods

A single-center retrospective chart review of all patients ≥ 18 y old with a diagnosis of liver cirrhosis who had TEG results documented in the electronic medical record from January 1 to November 1, 2021.

Results

There were 277 TEG results on 89 patients with cirrhosis. Overall, 91% of the TEGs performed were associated with a clinical indication for transfusion. However, of the patients who were transfused, abnormal TEG values, including elevated R time and reduced maximum amplitude, did not correspond to transfusion of indicated blood products (fresh frozen plasma and platelets). A reduction in alpha angle showed a statistically significant association with transfusion of cryoprecipitate (P < 0.05). When assessing conventional coagulation tests, abnormal values were not significantly associated with transfusion (P = 0.07).

Conclusions

Despite TEG suggesting that transfusions could be avoided in many cirrhotic patients, patients are still being transfused platelets and fresh frozen plasma in the absence of evidence of coagulopathy on TEG. Our finding suggests the need for education about appropriate utilization of TEG. More research is needed to understand the role of these tests to guide transfusion practices in patients with cirrhosis.

### Haemostatic alterations and management of haemostasis in patients with cirrhosis [^d76db245]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients with cirrhosis frequently acquire complex changes in their haemostatic system including a decreased platelet count and decreased levels of various haemostatic proteins. Although historically patients with cirrhosis were thought to have a haemostasis-related bleeding tendency, it is now widely accepted that the haemostatic system of patients with cirrhosis remains in balance as a result of simultaneous changes in pro- and anti-haemostatic systems. The concept of rebalanced haemostasis has led to changes in clinical management, although firm evidence from well-designed clinical studies is largely lacking. For example, many invasive procedures in patients with cirrhosis and a prolonged prothrombin time are now performed without prophylaxis with fresh frozen plasma. Conversely, clinicians have become more aware of the need for anti-thrombotic therapy, even in those patients with abnormal routine coagulation tests. This paper will outline recent advances in pathogenesis, prevention and treatment of both bleeding and thrombotic complications in patients with cirrhosis. Among other topics, we will discuss the haemostatic status of acutely ill patients with cirrhosis, the various causes of bleeding in patients with cirrhosis, and how best to prevent or treat bleeding. In addition, we will discuss the hypercoagulable features of patients with cirrhosis, new insights into the pathogenesis of portal vein thrombosis, and how best to prevent or treat thromboses.

Fibrinogen and antifibrinolytics in cirrhosis — thresholds, diagnostic limits, and prophylaxis: Plasma fibrinogen levels < 100 mg/dL are associated with spontaneous and procedure-related bleeding in patients with cirrhosis, and in a case series of critically ill surgical patients without cirrhosis, a fibrinogen level of ≥ 100 mg/dL resulted in greater mechanical clot stability compared to lower levels of fibrinogen. Diagnostic laboratory tests for hyperfibrinolysis are not readily available in clinical practice, current viscoelastic testing is not sensitive for moderate or mild hyperfibrinolysis, and the diagnosis of hyperfibrinolytic postprocedural bleeding is made clinically with typical manifestations including continuous venous oozing from skin puncture sites and persistent mucosal or submucosal bleeding. The text notes that elective procedures should be delayed during states of clinically apparent pathological fibrinolysis and that, until further supportive data are published, the prophylactic use of epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) or tranexamic acid to prevent procedural bleeding cannot be recommended; moreover, a high-dose tranexamic acid trial in acute gastrointestinal bleeding showed no reduction in death or bleeding and a subgroup analysis showed the risk of VTE events to be higher in patients with cirrhosis receiving tranexamic acid. The authors also state, "Therefore, correction of plasma fibrinogen to levels > 100 mg/dL using cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen".

### Cryoprecipitate. patterns of use [^df4de44c]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

The type of coagulation factors and proteins in cryoprecipitate determine the appropriate indications for its use. To determine the pattern of use at a tertiary care medical center, we performed a retrospective audit of cryoprecipitate utilization. A total of 51 patients received 88 pools of cryoprecipitate. In 39 patients, cryoprecipitate was transfused for appropriate indications: hypofibrinogenemia (n = 19), tissue plasminogen activator reversal (n = 1), management of massive transfusion (n = 7), correction of uremic bleeding (n = 2), and for making fibrin sealant (n = 10). Overall, these patients used approximately 80% of the cryoprecipitate transfused. In 12 other patients, cryoprecipitate was transfused inappropriately to attempt reversal of the anticoagulant effects of warfarin therapy (n = 6), to treat impaired surgical hemostasis in the absence of hypofibrinogenemia (n = 4), and to treat hepatic coagulopathy with multiple factor deficiencies (n = 2). The patterns of misuse, involving 24% of all cryoprecipitate orders, suggest a widespread misunderstanding and need for focused education about the coagulation factors and proteins present in cryoprecipitate and appropriate indications for its use.

### Treatment of bleeding in patients with liver disease [^f610a715]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Urgent diagnostic and potentially therapeutic endoscopic evaluation is needed in this patient and improved outcomes are demonstrated when performed in less than 12 h after presentation. There are extensive evidence‐based management recommendations for acute variceal bleeding that are beyond the scope of this document. Endoscopic and pharmacologic therapies are the mainstays of treatment for this life‐threatening disorder and are well described elsewhere. However, this patient will be admitted to an intensive care unit and requires resuscitation prior to endoscopic or other procedural therapy. This stage of patient care suffers from less evidence‐based recommendations. During this stage, the requirement for packed red blood cells (PRBC) raises the question whether addition of FFP and platelet concentrates are also required given the elevated INR and decreased platelet count in this patient.

Data from randomized controlled trials support a lower threshold of 7 g/dl for hemoglobin values when transfusing patients with cirrhosis and acute GI bleeding with PRBC. In a prospective randomized controlled trial of 921 patients (271 with cirrhosis) with severe GI bleeding, those assigned to transfusion using a lower threshold of 7 g/dl versus those assigned to 9 g/dl had improved 6‐week survival and less recurrent bleeding. The group assigned to the higher threshold also had significantly increased portal pressure within the first 5 days of hospitalization compared to the group with the lower threshold. This increase in portal pressures is contradictory to the aim of reducing overall portal pressures in the resuscitation of these patients and was likely a significant contributor to rebleeding rates in the patients undergoing more transfusions. This phenomenon of increasing portal hypertension with volume expansion has also been shown in experimental models with blood transfusion and crystalloid infusion. Care should be taken in this population to avoid aggressive volume overexpansion not only with PRBC but also with crystalloid and FFP in order to avoid paradoxical increase in portal hypertension and rebleeding risk.

### 44th international symposium on intensive care&emergency medicine [^891fbe66]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods: This was a randomized, prospective, active-controlled, pivotal phase 3, non-inferiority trial. Adult patients undergoing major spinal or abdominal surgery with clinically relevant blood loss were randomized (1:1) for blinded intravenous administration of human fibrinogen concentrate or center's standard of care, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or cryoprecipitate. The primary efficacy endpoint was the intra-operative blood loss measured after the decision to treat until the end of surgery in the per protocol set.

Results: Of the 339 patients screened at 15 sites, 222 were randomized to receive either human fibrinogen concentrate (n = 110) or FFP/cryoprecipitate (n = 112). Baseline characteristics (full analysis set) were similar between groups (mean age 61 years; 59% female; body mass index, 27.9). Human fibrinogen concentrate demonstrated non-inferiority efficacy to FFP/cryoprecipitate in reducing intra-operative blood loss: mean (standard deviation) of 1444.4 (992.77) mL in the human fibrinogen concentrate group and 1735.1 (1029.17) mL in the FFP/cryoprecipitate group (p < 0.001; least square mean difference − 279.4 mL, 95% confidence interval [− 552.38, − 6.48]). The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar between groups. A lower incidence of thromboembolic events was observed in the human fibrinogen concentrate group.

Conclusions: Fibrinogen concentrate was hemostatically efficacious, safe, and well tolerated as a complementary therapy for the management of uncontrolled severe hemorrhage in patients with acquired hypofibrinogenemia.

### Treatment of bleeding in patients with liver disease [^80fa9c9b]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Prevention and treatment of bleeding are common clinical scenarios encountered across a broad range of medical specialties for which hematologists are often consulted. Although for specific scenarios such as treatment of bleeding in patients with trauma, post‐partum bleeding, and prevention of bleeding in patients using antithrombotic therapyevidence‐based guidelines exist, it is unclear what the value of these protocols is in other settings. For example, the CRASH‐2and WOMANtrials on the use of tranexamic acid (TXA) in massive bleeding in trauma or post‐partum hemorrhage may have led to the assumption that TXA should be part of (massive) bleeding protocols in general. However, TXA was ineffective and caused harm in the HALT‐IT trial on gastrointestinal (GI) bleedingand was ineffective in the ULTRA trial on patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Also, although blood components such as fresh frozen plasma (FFP), platelet concentrates, and coagulation factor concentrates are frequently used in prevention and treatment of bleeding, there is very little evidence these treatments are effective. Hematologists are frequently consulted for prevention or treatment of bleeding in patients with cirrhosis. Importantly, many bleeding complications are unrelated to hemostatic failure, but are a consequence of portal hypertension or related to inadvertent vessel lacerations, for example during invasive procedures (Figure 1). Nevertheless, hemostatic interventions to prevent or treat bleeding complications that are unrelated to hemostatic failure are commonly administered, for example when using a general massive bleeding protocol in variceal bleeding. Also, prophylactic prohemostatic therapy is frequently administered in patients with liver disease prior to procedures with a very low bleeding risk such as paracentesis, diagnostic endoscopy, or placement of a central venous catheter. In clinical practice, the clinician performing the procedure will often mandate prohemostatic therapy because of abnormalities in routine diagnostic tests of hemostasis.

### Treatment of bleeding in patients with liver disease [^fdc2c474]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients with cirrhosis frequently have complex alterations in their hemostatic system. Although routine diagnostic tests of hemostasis in cirrhosis (platelet count, prothrombin time, fibrinogen level) are suggestive of a bleeding tendency, it is now widely accepted that these tests do not reflect hemostatic competence in this population. Rather, patients with cirrhosis appear to have a rebalanced hemostatic system with hypercoagulable elements. Therefore, routine correction of hemostasis laboratory values, for example by fresh frozen plasma or platelet concentrates, with the aim to avoid spontaneous or procedure-related bleeding is not indicated as is outlined in recent clinical guidance documents. However, little guidance on how to manage patients with cirrhosis that are actively bleeding is available. Here we present three common bleeding scenarios, variceal bleeding, post-procedural bleeding and bleeding in a critically ill cirrhosis patient, with specific management suggestions. As patients with cirrhosis generally have adequate hemostatic competence and as bleeding complications may be unrelated to hemostatic failure, prohemostatic therapy is not the first line of management in bleeding patients with cirrhosis, even in the presence of markedly abnormal platelet counts and/or prothrombin times. We provide a rationale for the restrictive approach to prohemostatic therapy in bleeding patients with cirrhosis.

### Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma and platelets in critically ill adults: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^ee2a7c64]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

For all recommendations, high-certainty evidence directly addressing each recommendation was either absent or insufficient. Therefore, our recommendations were primarily based upon expert opinion. This document provides recommendations for platelet transfusion thresholds in non-bleeding patients stratified by risk of bleeding and those with active bleeding. In the procedural setting, the evidence for platelets and FFP is limited but favors a first-line no transfusion approach for vascular, bedside thoracic or abdominal, and endoscopic procedures without biopsy. For LP, given the potentially catastrophic complications, a less restrictive approach is suggested. Despite the lack of high-certainty evidence, these guidelines provide a framework for managing critically ill patients with thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy. Shared decision-making and the implementation of institutional guidelines to standardize transfusion practices could optimize patient care, improve equity in access to blood products and reduce costs. On a large scale, this could amount to approximately half a million less units of platelets and FFP transfused annually. These guidelines should be an opportunity for institutions to develop local policies, monitor their impact on transfusion practices, and provide a framework to longitudinally optimize platelet and FFP use.

### Recommendations on the use of recombinant activated factor VII as an adjunctive treatment for massive bleeding – a European perspective [^7a575193]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Liver surgery

Recommendation. Prophylactic administration of rFVIIa during orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) or liver resection is not recommended. Grade B

Rationale. Several studies have examined the effect of rFVIIa in liver surgery. An early single-center safety study showed that patients receiving 80 μg/kg before OLT required fewer transfusions than matched historical controls, whereas in these same patients it was shown that rFVIIa enhanced thrombin generation in a localized, time-dependent manner and did not lead to systemic activation of coagulation or fibrinolysis.

A larger multicenter, placebo-controlled trial examined the effects of a single dose of rFVIIa (20, 40, or 80 μg/kg) administered immediately before surgery in 82 patients undergoing OLT as a result of chronic liver disease. This study failed to show any effect on the primary endpoint, RBC transfusion requirements, between placebo-treated and rFVIIa-treated patients. There were also no significant differences between treatment groups in the requirement for other transfusion products, total blood loss, crystalloid and colloid replacement volume, and the requirement for other hemostatic drugs during the perioperative period.

A subsequent randomized, placebo-controlled study in 183 patients undergoing OLT as a result of cirrhosis (Child–Turcotte–Pugh class B or C) used higher rFVIIa doses (60 and 120 μg/kg) or placebo repeated every 2 hours perioperatively. This study also failed to show any significant differences between placebo and rFVIIa in perioperative RBC transfusion requirements, the primary endpoint, although significantly more rFVIIa-treated patients avoided RBC transfusions than the placebo group (6 out of 62 in the 60 μg/kg group versus 0 out of 61 in the placebo group; p = 0.03). There were also no significant differences in the requirement for any other transfusion products, including FFP, platelet concentrate, and fibrinogen. Furthermore, compared with placebo, rFVIIa failed to show any benefits on overall blood loss, the requirements for crystalloid or colloid replacement, or length of stay in hospital or on the intensive care unit.

In a randomized, placebo-controlled study, 204 noncirrhotic patients undergoing liver resection received 20 or 80 μg/kg rFVIIa. No significant reduction was observed in RBC requirements, blood loss, or the number of patients transfused.

### Fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate: can we safely reduce their use in the NICU? [^b169f53a]. Journal of Perinatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To study patterns of use of Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) and Cryoprecipitate (CRYO) in a level 4 NICU and assess what proportions were not supported by literature.

Study Design

single centered retrospective observational. Charts of neonates admitted between 1/1/2010 to 12/31/2017 to CT Children's level 4 NICU were reviewed. Transfusions were assigned as "supported" or "non-supported" based on available evidence. Groups were compared using T-tests and chi-squared analyses.

Results

of 4110 total admissions, 197 (4.8%) received a total of 461 transfusions (374 FFP, 87 CRYO). Only 59% of FFP and 60% CRYO were supported by literature. Within the "non-supported" group the largest category was neonates transfused prophylactically.

Conclusion

A large proportion of transfusions administered to neonates was not evidence-based, suggesting there are opportunities for improvement in use of these products.

### Study details | High dose albumin in refractory ascites… [^b87e570f]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

This sub-group is managed by frequent large volume paracentesis along with intravenous albumin administration and are usually considered for liver transplantation and TIPS. Nonetheless, Frequent paracentesis increases the risk of infection, bleeding, bowel perforation, paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction and renal dysfunction in this sub-group of patients. Patients with advanced liver disease often has low serum albumin level. The Infusion of human albumin is a standard of care after removal of ascitic fluid in patients with cirrhosis with refractory ascites. The objective of the study is to prove that regular infusion of albumin prevents formation of fluid in abdomen or pleural fluid and thus reduces the requirement of paracentesis or thoracentesis, and prevent complications. The research design is a prospective, parallel, randomized, open label clinical trial. The target trial population comprises of patients with advanced cirrhosis.

Eligible patients will be randomized into either one of two categories: 1) the control group will receive the standard of care including moderate sodium restriction and maximal daily tolerated doses of diuretics, and 2) the Intervention group will receive intravenous human albumin at a dose weekly plus SOC. In both groups, when large-volume paracentesis is needed, the patient will receive human albumin in the dose of 6–8 g/L of ascites removed as SOC. Inclusion Criteria:

- Age > 18 years.
- patients diagnosed with liver cirrhosis. Refractory ascites which is defined as ascites failing to resolve after maximum tolerable dose of diuretics, and usually require frequent paracentesis. Exclusion Criteria:

- Patients < 18y and patients with no history of liver cirrhosis
- patients with refractory ascites but have trans-jagular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts with previous 3 months.

Exclusion Criteria:

- Patients < 18y
- patients with no history of liver cirrhosis
- patients with refractory ascites but have transjagular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts with previous 3 months
- Patients with ascites due to other causes, including cardiac, malignant.

### Update on the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^49c1620a]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Platelets and clotting factors

Limited evidence exists regarding the need, or threshold, for platelet transfusion in UGIB. The British Society of Gastroenterology consensus bundle advises a threshold of transfusion at 50×10 9 platelets/L or less based on major haemorrhage protocols with the acknowledgment that this advice is based primarily on expert opinion. Within the context of variceal bleeding, no evidence suggests that platelet count correlates with inability to control bleeding or rebleeding. However, in the event of these outcomes, the Baveno VII consensus advises correction can be considered on an individual basis, whereas the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and British Society of Gastroenterology variceal guidelines advise transfusion at the threshold of 50×10 9 /L or less.

Clotting abnormalities and their management in patients with cirrhosis and UGIB is a complex area. Prothrombin time is often prolonged leading to the use of fresh frozen plasma; however, prothrombin is not an accurate indicator of the clotting risk in cirrhosis. Studies have not shown a clear benefit from fresh frozen plasma and the most recent iteration of US variceal guidelines did not advocate its use in patients with cirrhosis and UGIB.

### Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma and platelets in critically ill adults: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^a88d62a8]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Platelets and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) are frequently administered to critically ill patients. Considering the variability in indications and thresholds guiding these transfusions, a comprehensive review of current evidence was conducted to provide guidance to critical care practitioners. This American College of Chest Physicians guideline examined the literature on platelet transfusions in critically ill patients with thrombocytopenia, with and without active bleeding, as well as data on prophylactic platelet and FFP transfusions for common procedures in the critical care setting.

Study Design and Methods

A panel of experts developed seven Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome questions addressing platelet and FFP transfusions in critically ill patients and performed a comprehensive evidence review. The panel applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach to assess the certainty of evidence, and to formulate and grade recommendations. A modified Delphi technique was used to reach consensus on the recommendations.

Results

The initial search identified a total of 7,172 studies, and after the initial screening, 100 articles were reviewed. Sixteen studies met inclusion criteria, comprising 1 randomized controlled trial and 15 observational studies. Overall, the certainty of the evidence for all questions was very low. The panel formulated seven conditional recommendations.

Conclusions

In critically ill patients with thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy, a risk/benefit assessment should be made by providers prior to transfusion of platelets or FFP. Given the known risks of blood product transfusion, and the limited data regarding the benefits from platelet or FFP transfusion, most patients will benefit from avoiding transfusion of these blood products. In patients at high risk of bleeding, or where the bleeding complication may be catastrophic, transfusion should be considered.

### Coagulation support during perioperative bleeding management [^61785984]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Moving towards individualized coagulation support

Goal-directed therapy

MTPs provide support for perioperative bleeding management, although additional strategies are needed. Beyond procedural interventions and surgical bleeding repair, goal-directed therapy is increasingly used for major bleeding. As part of this strategy, VET-guided transfusion strategies consistently reduce allogeneic blood administration in cardiothoracic surgical patients. However, studies comparing VET with conventional coagulation testing to guide transfusion support in liver transplant surgery have demonstrated mixed results. In one recent VET-guided liver transplant surgical study, RBCs and FFP transfusions were reduced, and there were no differences in platelet transfusions, but cryoprecipitate administration was increased. After trauma-induced bleeding, transfusion strategies with VET compared to conventional coagulation assays have also been reported to reduce mortality. However, transfusion strategy with VET-augmented coagulation support did not improve survival or reduce the need for MTPs. Most studies of VET compared to conventional coagulation tests use an algorithmic approach; however, the benefits may be due to using an evidence-based, algorithmic approach to bleeding management that avoids any empiric administration of blood products. Patients with acquired coagulopathy and active bleeding may benefit the most from goal-directed coagulation support as part of established algorithms.

### Guidelines on the use of liver biopsy in clinical practice from the British society of gastroenterology, the royal college of radiologists and the royal college of pathology [^00587e91]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

The recent guidelines from the American Gastroenterology Associationinclude the recommendations that blood products should be used sparingly because they increase portal pressure and carry a risk of transfusion-associated circulatory overload, transfusion-related acute lung injury, infection transmission, alloimmunisation and/or transfusion reactions.

The following transfusion thresholds for management of active bleeding or high-risk procedures may optimise clot formation in advanced liver disease: haematocrit ≥ 25%, platelet count > 50 x 10 9 /L, and fibrinogen > 120 mg/dL. Commonly used thresholds for correction of the INR are not supported by evidence.

The large volume of fresh frozen plasma required to reach an arbitrary INR target, limitations of the usual target, minimal effect on thrombin generation, and adverse effects on portal pressure limit the usefulness of this agent considerably.

In contrast, decompensated liver disease with acute or chronic liver failure is associated with a progressive consumptive coagulopathy and hypofibrinogenaemia, often with hyperfibrinolysis. Spontaneous mucocutaneous and other bleeding manifestations may become evident at this stage. In one study, a platelet count < 30×10 9 /L, fibrinogen level < 0.6 g/L and activated partial thromboplastin time values > 100 s were the strongest independent predictors for new onset of major bleeding. All but the most essential invasive procedures should be avoided under these circumstances. Acute kidney injury has also been associated with an increased risk of bleeding after paracentesis in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.

Treatment with vitamin K should be considered in patients with an increased INR, which may in part reflect vitamin K deficiency; particularly in patients in intensive care, in patients with malnutrition, in patients using antibiotics and in patients with cholestatic liver disease.

4 DISCUSSION

In this study, the effect of prophylactic FFP and platelet transfusion on the hemostatic status of patients with liver disease was assessed in a real‐life clinical setting. Following FFP transfusion, both in and ex vivo thrombin generation was significantly increased to levels higher than those found in healthy controls. These findings in part deviate from a recent clinical study in patients with chronic liver disease, where much more moderate increases in thrombin generation (5.7% and 23.4% for ETP and thrombin peak, respectively) following FFP transfusion were shown. 17 In line with previous studies, 18 platelet transfusion resulted in a median increase in platelet count of 15 × 10 9 /L, corresponding with a platelet count of 43 [39‐64] × 10 9 /L after platelet transfusion, which was accompanied by increases in in vivo markers of coagulation activation, and IL‐6, and by a slight increase in a marker for NET formation.

### The effects of a computerized transfusion decision support system on physician compliance and its appropriateness for fresh frozen plasma use in a medical center [^66732392]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusion remains a significant issue for blood banks because of a lack of consensus regarding its appropriate use. To study the factors influencing physician compliance, we evaluated FFP transfusion episodes in the year 2008, using a computerized transfusion decision support system. A total of 10,926 episodes were reviewed. The demographic data, physician compliance, and therapeutic efficacy were investigated. The physician noncompliance rate was 46.5%. The highest number was ordered by the hepatobiliary division, which might be due to the high incidence of liver cirrhosis and hepatoma in Taiwan. Excluding the cases for plasma exchange and emergency surgery, 31.2% of episodes had abnormal coagulation results before transfusions. The therapeutic efficacy is statistically significant in patients with abnormal pretransfusion coagulation tests (P < .001). Computerization may be a favorable trend in medical management systems, but it should be more functional to improve medical quality.

### AASLD practice guidance on risk stratification and management of portal hypertension and varices in cirrhosis [^8b8bd3b4]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AASLD practice guidance — acute variceal hemorrhage (AVH), initial bleed — AVH remains an emergent complication of cirrhosis and requires timely and effective management to prevent short-term mortality; even with therapeutic advancements for AVH, 6-week mortality still ranges from 10% to 15%. Patients presenting with AVH should be transferred to a medical care unit that provides proper levels of nursing and medical care, such as an intensive care unit. Placement of adequate intravenous access and airway assessment with early endoscopy are initial measures for resuscitation. Given increased mortality risk while intubated, providers should attempt extubation as soon as deemed safely feasible. Vasoactive therapy that is aimed to reduce portal pressure and collateral blood flow as well as antimicrobial prophylaxis should be initiated immediately on presentation and maintained for 2–5 days, and intravenous antimicrobials are recommended until stability for discharge or 5 days, whichever is shorter, in the absence of active infection. Intravenous ceftriaxone dosed at 1 g every 24 hours is often preferred because of high rates of quinolone resistance; however, systemic antimicrobial choice should be tailored to local hospital antimicrobial resistance and stewardship policies. Because aspiration pneumonia is the most common infection to develop in patients admitted for variceal bleeding, routine pre-endoscopic or preintubation placement of nasogastric tubes should be discouraged. Packed red blood cell transfusion goals should be restricted for a target hemoglobin of about 7 g/dL in the absence of comorbidities or instability that might merit higher targets, and liberal transfusion of frozen plasma and other blood products should be avoided to prevent worsening survival and worsening portal pressure. Most deaths from AVH occur in patients with CTP C; patients with CTP A rarely die from variceal bleeding.

Best practice advice on perioperative hemostasis in cirrhosis — There are no established preoperative safety thresholds for common laboratory values related to bleeding and clotting, and the INR is not predictive of procedural bleeding risk in patients with cirrhosis. In vitro studies suggest that a platelet count > 50,000/μL is adequate to generate thrombin and provide stable clot formation, and clinical studies show an increased bleeding tendency in patients with a platelet count lower than this threshold; critically ill patients with plasma fibrinogen levels < 100 mg/dL may have more bleeding events. Handle coagulation management on a case-by-case basis preferably using viscoelastic testing directed therapy and avoid needless transfusions or volume overload.

### Treatment of bleeding in patients with liver disease [^d24f5d5f]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

TABLE 1
Routine laboratory findings in ACLF, acquired hyperfibrinolysis and disseminated intravascular coagulation

The overlapping features of these diagnoses are highlighted in (Table 1). There are no specific established therapies for bleeding in ACLF and the cornerstone of treatment is to address the underlying cause, in this case sepsis and associated AKI. The role of continued hemostatic support is uncertain, conventional supportive targets for bleeding patients with DIC are unlikely to be appropriate in this patient group given the specified thresholds for platelet count (< 50 000/µl), PT (< 1.5× normal) and fibrinogen (< 1.5 g/L) may be 'supranormal' compared to the individual's baseline coagulation parameters. Alternate replacement therapy such as PCC and fibrinogen concentrates should be reserved for those with volume overload where FFP/cryoprecipitate transfusion is not possible (although there is no evidence to support their use in this setting). Outside GI bleeding (HALT‐IT), there are no specific studies of antifibrinolytics in ACLF and bleeding. However, antifibrinolytics are suggested as a rescue therapy for controlling bleeding post procedurally.

For this patient, the mainstay of therapy is management of sepsis and AKI. Whilst there is no evidence, a trial of antifibrinolytics is warranted (with prompt cessation when bleeding stops). If this fails, low dose fibrinogen concentrate (for example 1 g as a single dose) may be appropriate, particularly if fluid balance is challenging. This should not be continued to achieve a specific fibrinogen target but emphasis should be on bleeding control. Given the low yield and questionable efficacy of platelet concentrates in this setting, platelet concentrates are not recommended. Similarly, as large volumes of FFP are required for a meaningful reduction of the PT/INR, its questionable efficacy, and the risk of volume overload resulting in a paradoxical increased bleeding risk, FFP is not recommended.

### AASLD practice guidance on risk stratification and management of portal hypertension and varices in cirrhosis [^e3581209]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AASLD portal hypertension — acute variceal hemorrhage (AVH) initial management guidance states that all patients with known or suspected cirrhosis presenting with acute gastrointestinal bleeding should be initiated on vasoactive therapy and intravenous antibacterial therapy prior to endoscopy; following endoscopy, vasoactive therapy should be continued for 2–5 days; intravenous antibacterial treatment should be tailored, with ceftriaxone 1 g/24 hours for up to 5 days commonly used, and therapy can be discontinued once bleeding is controlled and in absence of an active infection; packed red blood cell transfusions should target a hemoglobin ~ 7 g/dL unless higher targets are required; fresh frozen plasma and platelet transfusions should not be administered based on international normalized ratio or platelet count targets because there is no evidence of benefit and, for fresh frozen plasma, there is evidence of potential harm; upper endoscopy should be performed within 12 hours of presentation with AVH, and if esophageal variceal bleeding is confirmed, EVL should be performed.

### AGA clinical practice update: coagulation in cirrhosis [^f1361cd1]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Tests of hemostasis in cirrhosis — INR and conventional labs: All currently available laboratory measures of hemostasis have significant limitations in liver disease patients and lack adequate prospective data, especially as pre-procedure risk measures. The international normalized ratio (INR) is the most problematic because of its entrenched but unfounded position in traditional medical teaching, and the test is a mathematical manipulation of the prothrombin time that measures procoagulant factors I, II, V, VII, and X but does not measure the deficit of liver-derived anticoagulant factors, such as protein C. This causes significant variation in the INR in cirrhosis between different hospitals, depending on which thromboplastin is used in the test, and use of fresh frozen plasma to "correct" a prolonged INR in cirrhosis does not actually change thrombin production (factor II), but does exacerbate portal hypertension.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of disseminated intravascular coagulation. British Committee for Standards in Haematology [^eba4f032]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) should encompass both clinical and laboratory information. The International Society for Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) DIC scoring system provides objective measurement of DIC. Where DIC is present the scoring system correlates with key clinical observations and outcomes. It is important to repeat the tests to monitor the dynamically changing scenario based on laboratory results and clinical observations. The cornerstone of the treatment of DIC is treatment of the underlying condition. Transfusion of platelets or plasma (components) in patients with DIC should not primarily be based on laboratory results and should in general be reserved for patients who present with bleeding. In patients with DIC and bleeding or at high risk of bleeding (e.g. postoperative patients or patients due to undergo an invasive procedure) and a platelet count of < 50 x 10(9)/l transfusion of platelets should be considered. In non-bleeding patients with DIC, prophylactic platelet transfusion is not given unless it is perceived that there is a high risk of bleeding. In bleeding patients with DIC and prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), administration of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) may be useful. It should not be instituted based on laboratory tests alone but should be considered in those with active bleeding and in those requiring an invasive procedure. There is no evidence that infusion of plasma stimulates the ongoing activation of coagulation. If transfusion of FFP is not possible in patients with bleeding because of fluid overload, consider using factor concentrates such as prothrombin complex concentrate, recognising that these will only partially correct the defect because they contain only selected factors, whereas in DIC there is a global deficiency of coagulation factors. Severe hypofibrinogenaemia (< 1 g/l) that persists despite FFP replacement may be treated with fibrinogen concentrate or cryoprecipitate. In cases of DIC where thrombosis predominates, such as arterial or venous thromboembolism, severe purpura fulminans associated with acral ischemia or vascular skin infarction, therapeutic doses of heparin should be considered. In these patients where there is perceived to be a co-existing high risk of bleeding there may be benefits in using continuous infusion unfractionated heparin (UFH) due to its short half-life and reversibility. Weight adjusted doses (e.g. 10 mu/kg/h) may be used without the intention of prolonging the APTT ratio to 1.5–2.5 times the control. Monitoring the APTT in these cases may be complicated and clinical observation for signs of bleeding is important. In critically ill, non-bleeding patients with DIC, prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism with prophylactic doses of heparin or low molecular weight heparin is recommended. Consider treating patients with severe sepsis and DIC with recombinant human activated protein C (continuous infusion, 24 microg/kg/h for 4 d). Patients at high risk of bleeding should not be given recombinant human activated protein C. Current manufacturers guidance advises against using this product in patients with platelet counts of < 30 x 10(9)/l. In the event of invasive procedures, administration of recombinant human activated protein C should be discontinued shortly before the intervention (elimination half-life approximately 20 min) and may be resumed a few hours later, dependent on the clinical situation. In the absence of further prospective evidence from randomised controlled trials confirming a beneficial effect of antithrombin concentrate on clinically relevant endpoints in patients with DIC and not receiving heparin, administration of antithrombin cannot be recommended. In general, patients with DIC should not be treated with antifibrinolytic agents. Patients with DIC that is characterised by a primary hyperfibrinolytic state and who present with severe bleeding could be treated with lysine analogues, such as tranexamic acid (e.g. 1 g every 8 h).
