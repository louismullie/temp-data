## Question

On average, how much weight gain occurs with Abilify?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how much weight gain occurs on average with Abilify (aripiprazole). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about formulation and timeframe, because short-term oral trials differ from long-acting injectable data and long-term follow-up. Then, I should stratify by patient population, since antipsychotic-naive first-episode patients gain more than chronic stable adults. Next, I will verify quantitative estimates from FDA labels and high-quality meta-analyses. After that, I will consider dose-related effects and the threshold for clinically significant gain. Finally, I will synthesize a practical "typical" range while noting important exceptions and monitoring recommendations [^11236qsx] [^114aki4D].

> Let me first confirm the general weight-gain liability of aripiprazole relative to other antipsychotics, so I don't overstate the average effect. Across randomized trials, aripiprazole typically produces mild mean weight gain versus placebo, generally ≤ 1 kg over short-term durations, placing it among the more metabolically favorable antipsychotics compared with agents like olanzapine or clozapine, which carry higher risk of weight gain and metabolic complications [^114aki4D] [^116sTGgN].

> Now I should verify short-term oral data from the FDA label to anchor the "average". In pooled placebo-controlled monotherapy trials of 3–8 weeks (median about 3–4 weeks), the mean weight change with aripiprazole was approximately +0.3 kg compared to −0.1 kg with placebo, and in a smaller 24-week cohort the mean change was −1.5 kg versus −0.2 kg with placebo, which suggests little net gain on average over longer follow-up in chronic adult populations, consistent with a low mean effect size in meta-analyses [^11236qsx] [^114aki4D].

> Hold on, adjunctive use in depression can look different, so I need to check that separately. With aripiprazole added to antidepressants for 6 weeks, the FDA label reports a mean weight increase of about +1.7 kg versus +0.4 kg with adjunctive placebo; if I linearly extrapolate that to a year, it might suggest 12–14 kg, but wait, let me verify the trajectory because that kind of straight-line projection is misleading, as weight gain with antipsychotics commonly slows and can plateau after the initial weeks to months, so the early 6-week signal should not be extrapolated linearly across a year [^11236qsx] [^114wppoG].

> Next, I should review long-acting injectable data, since some clinicians see more early weight changes with LAIs. For aripiprazole Maintena, the mean change at 12 weeks was about +3.5 kg versus +0.8 kg with placebo, while over 52 weeks in an open-label study, the mean increase was roughly +1.0 kg, and about 21.4% experienced a clinically significant gain of ≥ 7% body weight, indicating that while the long-term mean is modest, a nontrivial subset has meaningful increases [^112yUP2D].

> But wait, what if we are dealing with antipsychotic-naive or very early psychosis, where susceptibility is higher? Let me check those data. In early psychosis, a prospective cohort found a combined average gain of about 7.1 kg over a median 15 months, with a formulation effect: oral aripiprazole averaged approximately +11.0 kg versus about +3.7 kg with the LAI over that period, implying that "average" in first-episode care is substantially higher than in chronic populations, and the difference was not explained by baseline factors or dosage in that study [^116fG5Q5] [^1163Tura].

> I should confirm pediatric and adolescent risk, since "average" also varies by age. The pediatric label highlights that after 26 weeks of open-label therapy in pooled adolescent and pediatric cohorts, about 32.8% gained ≥ 7% of baseline body weight before adjustment for normal growth, reinforcing the need to monitor against age- and sex-adjusted norms during treatment and to contextualize any weight change in the expected growth trajectory [^115aHsFg].

> I need to check for dose-related effects too, because clinicians often ask whether higher doses drive more gain. A longitudinal cohort linked higher aripiprazole doses to greater initial weight gain, with an interaction over time such that after roughly five months, lower doses showed more ongoing increase; importantly, each 5 mg dose increment was associated with about a 30% higher odds of ≥ 7% weight gain over one year, so dose can modulate risk even though mean short-term gains remain small overall in trials [^113YijcK] [^114aki4D].

> Let me make sure I frame "clinically significant" weight gain correctly. Regulatory and clinical literature commonly use a ≥ 7% increase from baseline as a threshold; for aripiprazole LAI, around one in five patients met this threshold over one year, while other labels, like risperidone, also report outcomes by the ≥ 7% criterion, underscoring its cross-antipsychotic relevance for monitoring and counseling patients about risk even when the group mean is small [^112yUP2D] [^115Vft9t].

> Pulling this together, I should double-check the bottom-line ranges for the scenarios clinicians encounter. For typical adults on oral aripiprazole monotherapy, short-term average gain is about 0–1 kg, with longer-term means near neutral or slightly negative in chronic populations; for adjunctive therapy in depression, average gain is roughly 1–2 kg over 6 weeks but does not reliably scale linearly over time; for LAI aripiprazole, average gain is around 3–4 kg by 12 weeks and about 1 kg by one year on average, with approximately 20% crossing the ≥ 7% threshold; in antipsychotic-naive first-episode patients, average gain can be substantially higher, roughly 7–11 kg over 12–15 months depending on formulation, with oral generally higher than LAI in the available cohort data, so the "average" depends strongly on who is being treated and with what formulation [^11236qsx] [^112yUP2D] [^116fG5Q5] [^114aki4D].

> Before I conclude, I should ensure the clinical implications are explicit. Even when the mean effect is small, outliers and vulnerable subgroups can have clinically significant increases, so early and regular monitoring is warranted, and if weight rises rapidly, evidence-informed prevention strategies such as metformin initiation in at-risk groups or early gain beyond 3% in the first year, and consideration of GLP-1 receptor agonists per obesity guidelines, should be discussed as part of shared decision-making without delaying psychiatric stabilization [^116YyuhK] [^112hD56s] [^113iVRLy].

Abilify (aripiprazole) causes **minimal average weight gain** in adults, with a mean change of +0.3 kg in short-term trials and –1.5 kg at 24 weeks [^11236qsx] [^114aki4D]. In pediatric patients, **average weight gain is higher** — about 2.4 kg over 8 weeks — and 32.8% gain ≥ 7% of baseline weight by 26 weeks. Clinically significant weight gain (≥ 7% of baseline) occurs in about **8% of adults** and **32.8% of pediatric patients** [^115aHsFg]. The risk is lower than with many other antipsychotics [^114aki4D], but monitoring and early intervention are still recommended [^117WXyyf].

---

## Average weight gain in adults

- **Short-term trials**: In 13 placebo-controlled monotherapy trials (median exposure 21–25 days), the mean weight change was +0.3 kg (N = 1673) vs –0.1 kg with placebo (N = 1100) [^11236qsx].

- **Longer-term trials**: At 24 weeks, mean weight change was –1.5 kg (n = 73) vs –0.2 kg with placebo (n = 46) [^11236qsx].

- **Adjunctive antidepressant trials**: After 8 weeks of antidepressant lead-in, 6 weeks of adjunctive aripiprazole led to +1.7 kg (N = 347) vs +0.4 kg with placebo (N = 330) [^11236qsx].

- **Clinically significant gain**: ≥ 7% weight gain occurred in 8% of adults on aripiprazole vs 3% on placebo [^11236qsx].

---

## Average weight gain in pediatric patients

- **Short-term trials**: In two 8-week placebo-controlled trials, mean weight gain was 2.4 kg (N = 381) vs 0.2 kg with placebo (N = 187).

- **Longer-term trials**: At 26 weeks, 32.8% gained ≥ 7% of baseline weight (not adjusted for growth) [^115aHsFg].

- **Growth-adjusted gain**: After 9 months, 21.8% had a z-score increase ≥ 0.5 SD, and 7.1% had ≥ 1.0 SD.

## Weight gain with long-acting injectable formulations

With long-acting injectables [^116fG5Q5], **Abilify Maintena** in a 12-week placebo-controlled trial showed a mean weight change of +3.5 kg (N = 99) vs +0.8 kg with placebo (N = 66) [^112yUP2D]. In a **long-term bipolar study**, the 52-week mean weight increase was 1.0 kg; 21.4% had ≥ 7% gain, and 15.4% had ≥ 7% loss [^112yUP2D].

---

## Factors influencing weight gain

Aripiprazole-associated weight gain is influenced by **dose and duration** [^114aki4D]; higher doses and longer exposure increase risk [^113YijcK]. **Younger age, lower baseline BMI, and first-episode psychosis** also raise risk [^115vtrnX] [^111yvk18]. Genetic polymorphisms, such as MC4R variants, may predispose to weight gain [^111DnuzE].

## Comparison with other antipsychotics

Aripiprazole has a lower **weight-gain risk** than many other antipsychotics [^114aki4D]:

| **Measure** | **Aripiprazole** | **Olanzapine** | **Risperidone** | **Quetiapine** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Short-term mean weight gain | +0.3 kg (short-term) | +2.6 kg (6 weeks) | +2.0 kg (3–8 weeks) [^115Vft9t] | +2.3 kg (6 weeks) [^113koHv1] |
| Long-term mean weight gain | –1.5 kg (24 weeks) | +5.6 kg (48 weeks) [^115PLFJp] | +4.3 kg (24 weeks) [^115Vft9t] | +4.5 kg (4 years) [^113koHv1] |

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Given the lower but non-negligible risk, **clinicians should**:

- **Monitor weight**: Regularly track weight, BMI, and metabolic parameters [^117WXyyf].

- **Lifestyle interventions**: Use diet and exercise to limit gain [^116sTGgN].

- **Pharmacological interventions**: Consider metformin or GLP-1 agonists [^113iVRLy] [^116YyuhK] [^11522jww] if gain occurs.

- **Switching strategies**: Switch to lower-risk agents if gain is significant [^113d24pr] [^111mMcTV].

### Abilify [^11236qsx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In an analysis of 13 placebo-controlled, monotherapy trials, primarily from pooled schizophrenia and bipolar disorder trials with a median exposure of 21 to 25 days, the mean change in body weight in Abilify-treated patients was +0.3 kg (N = 1673) compared to –0.1 kg (N = 1100) in placebo-controlled patients. At 24 weeks, the mean change from baseline in body weight in Abilify-treated patients was –1.5 kg (n = 73) compared to –0.2 kg (n = 46) in placebo-treated patients.

In the trials adding Abilify to antidepressants, patients first received 8 weeks of antidepressant treatment followed by 6 weeks of adjunctive Abilify or placebo in addition to their ongoing antidepressant treatment. The mean change in body weight in patients receiving adjunctive Abilify was +1.7 kg (N = 347) compared to +0.4 kg (N = 330) in patients receiving adjunctive placebo.

### Abilify [^115aHsFg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Table 13 shows the percentage of pediatric and adolescent patients with weight gain ≥ 7% of body weight by indication.

In an open-label trial that enrolled patients from the two placebo-controlled trials of adolescents with schizophrenia (13 to 17 years) and pediatric patients with bipolar disorder (10 to 17 years), 73.2% of patients (238/325) completed 26 weeks of therapy with Abilify. After 26 weeks, 32.8% of patients gained ≥ 7% of their body weight, not adjusted for normal growth. To adjust for normal growth, z-scores were derived (measured in standard deviations [SD]), which normalize for the natural growth of pediatric patients and adolescents by comparison to age- and gender-matched population standards.

When treating pediatric patients for any indication, weight gain should be monitored and assessed against that expected for normal growth.

- **Pathological gambling and other compulsive behaviors**: Postmarketing case reports suggest that patients can experience intense urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these urges while taking aripiprazole. Other compulsive urges may also occur.

### Metformin for the prevention of antipsychotic-induced weight gain: Guideline development and consensus validation [^116YyuhK]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for bipolar disorder, specifically in the context of preventing antipsychotic-induced weight gain, the AIWG-ICG 2024 guidelines recommend co-prescribing metformin with any antipsychotic if there is more than a 3% increase in baseline body weight during the first year of treatment with an antipsychotic.

### Effects of long-term antipsychotics treatment on body weight: A population-based cohort study [^113koHv1]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

The weight gain in individuals who were initiated on a high dose of antipsychotics (AP) was greater than those initiated on a low dose. When olanzapine was initiated at a high dose (> 5 mg), women gained +0.534 kg/week (+3.2 kg over 6 weeks), and men gained +0.743 kg/week (+4.5 kg over 6 weeks), compared with low-dose gains of +0.314 kg/week (+1.9 kg over 6 weeks) for women and +0.425 kg/week (+2.6 kg over 6 weeks) for men.

The short-term effect of quetiapine initiation was also stronger for those given high doses (> 75 mg), with women gaining +2.3 kg and men +1.6 kg, both over 6 weeks, than for those given low doses, where women gained +0.7 kg and men +0.5 kg, both over 6 weeks. However, there was a relatively small difference for those initiated on risperidone. Low doses (≤ 2 mg) led to a weight gain of +1.0 kg over 6 weeks for both women and men, while high doses resulted in women gaining +1.1 kg and men gaining +1.9 kg, both over 6 weeks.

In the short term, those given low doses of olanzapine tended to gain more weight as their weight at baseline was lower. This was indicated by the correlation between intercept and slope for women (–0.155, 95% CI: –0.230 to –0.078) and men (–0.135, 95% CI: –0.235 to –0.033).

### Does switching antipsychotics ameliorate weight gain in patients with severe mental illness? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113d24pr]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2021). Low credibility.

Obesity and adverse metabolic outcomes in patients with severe mental illness are clinically significant but potentially preventable. Importantly, the evidence for switching to antipsychotics to reduce cardiometabolic burden is unclear.

- **Method**: PubMED, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane were searched from inception to March 8, 2020. Articles reporting weight and metabolic changes after antipsychotic switching versus staying on the previous antipsychotic were meta-analyzed both across and within groups.

- **Results**: Of 61 identified studies, 59 were meta-analyzed (40% rated high quality). In the switch-vs-stay pairwise meta-analyses, only aripiprazole significantly reduced weight (-5.52 kg, 95% CI -10.63, -0.42, P = .03), while olanzapine significantly increased weight (2.46 kg, 95% CI 0.34, 4.57, P = .02). Switching to aripiprazole also significantly improved fasting glucose (-3.99 mg/dl, 95% CI -7.34, -0.64, P = .02) and triglycerides (-31.03 mg/dl, 95% CI -48.73, -13.34, P = .0001). Dropout and psychosis ratings did not differ between switch and stay groups for aripiprazole and olanzapine. In before-to-after switch meta-analyses, aripiprazole (-1.96 kg, 95% CI -3.07, -0.85, P < .001) and ziprasidone (-2.22 kg, 95% CI -3.84, -0.60, P = .007) were associated with weight loss, whereas olanzapine (2.71 kg, 95% CI 1.87, 3.55, P < .001), and clozapine (2.80 kg, 95% CI 0.26, 5.34, P = .03) were associated with weight gain. No significant weight or other cardiometabolic changes were observed when switching to amisulpride, paliperidone/risperidone, quetiapine, or lurasidone.

### Behavioral interventions for antipsychotic induced appetite changes [^116sTGgN]. Current psychiatry reports (2013). Low credibility.

- **Potential drivers of antipsychotic-induced weight gain and increased appetite**: Of the FGAs, low-potency phenothiazines, such as chlorpromazine, carry the highest risk of increasing weight. Chlorpromazine may even increase the risk of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. In contrast, the risk of weight gain is relatively low with high-potency FGAs such as perphenazine, fluphenazine, and haloperidol. Of the SGAs, clozapine and olanzapine are most likely to increase weight and appetite and stimulate overeating. Both drugs also increase the risk of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Quetiapine, risperidone, paliperidone, asenapine, iloperidone, and sertindole can also increase weight but to a lesser extent. These drugs are currently not associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome. Ziprasidone, amisulpride, aripiprazole, and possibly lurasidone belong to a third category of antipsychotic drugs where the risk of weight gain and appetite increase tends to be low or negligible.

- **Identifying receptors facilitating weight gain**: Blockade of dopamine (D2 and D3), serotonin (5HT2c), muscarinic (M3), and histamine (H1) receptors have all been implicated in increasing appetite. Weight gain liability seems inversely correlated to the specificity of the receptor profile of the antipsychotic drugs; the more receptors targeted, the less specific the drug and the more likely weight gain. Thus, it is the non-specificity of an individual drug, rather than categorization into FGAs and SGAs, that predicts weight gain liability or metabolic risk.

### Weight changes in people with early psychosis treated with oral or long-acting injectable aripiprazole [^116fG5Q5]. Schizophrenia Research (2023). High credibility.

Weight gain remains a major problem in young people with psychosis treated with antipsychotic medication. Aripiprazole is now available in monthly long-acting injection (LAI) and daily oral tablet formulations, but information is lacking about differences in weight gain between the two formulations. We monitored for up to 24 months the weight changes associated with oral or LAI-administered aripiprazole and in a group not prescribed any antipsychotic medication.

- **Methods**: Participants included 109 young people with early psychosis (n = 30 Oral, 41 LAI, 38 Nil antipsychotic), with a treatment completion median time of 15 months. Weight (kilogram) and body mass index (BMI) were recorded at 3-month intervals. Multilevel modelling analyses assessed the contribution of time and group on weight change.

- **Results**: Participants taking nil antipsychotics did not gain weight over time, while the two aripiprazole groups gained a combined average of 7.1 kg (SD = 5.0) or 1.9 BMI (SD = 0.4). An examination of formulation effects showed a significantly greater rate of change over time in the Oral group, with a weight increase of approximately 11.0 kg (SD = 8.2) or 3.5 BMI (SD = 0.7), compared to the LAI group, which had a gain of 3.7 kg (SD = 2.1) or 0.8 BMI (SD = 0.1). These differences could not be explained by demographic or clinical characteristics, medication dosage, or baseline weight.

- **Conclusions**: While aripiprazole is generally considered relatively benign in terms of weight, it still poses a significant risk especially for people with early psychosis.

### Risperdal [^115Vft9t]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Weight gain has been observed with atypical antipsychotic use, and clinical monitoring of weight is recommended.

- **Adult studies**: Data on mean changes in body weight and the proportion of subjects meeting a weight gain criterion of 7% or greater of body weight from seven placebo-controlled, 3- to 8-week, fixed- or flexible-dose studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia or bipolar mania are presented in Table 6. In longer-term, controlled and uncontrolled studies, Risperdal was associated with a mean change in weight of +4.3 kg at week 24 (n = 395) and +5.3 kg at week 48 (n = 203).

- **Pediatric studies**: Data on mean changes in body weight and the proportion of subjects meeting the criterion of ≥ 7% gain in body weight from nine placebo-controlled, 3- to 8-week, fixed-dose studies in children and adolescents with schizophrenia (13–17 years of age), bipolar mania (10–17 years of age), autistic disorder (5–17 years of age), or other psychiatric disorders (5–17 years of age) are presented in Table 7. In longer-term, uncontrolled, open-label extension pediatric studies, Risperdal was associated with a mean change in weight of +5.5 kg at week 24 (n = 748) and +8.0 kg at week 48 (n = 242).

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 analogs against antipsychotic-induced weight gain: Potential physiological benefits [^11522jww]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The study examines the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs to counteract weight gain associated with the use of second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs). It explores the physiological benefits these analogs may offer in the context of antipsychotic-induced weight gain.

The research focuses on the implications for conditions such as body mass index (BMI) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which are common concerns among individuals taking SGAs. The paper provides insights into how GLP-1 analogs might mitigate these adverse effects.

### Antipsychotic-induced weight gain: Dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114aki4D]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2022). High credibility.

Weight gain is among the most important side effects of antipsychotics, yet it remains unclear whether it is associated with antipsychotic doses. This study aimed to fill this gap through a dose-response meta-analysis.

- **Methods**: We searched multiple electronic databases (last updated June 2021) to find all fixed-dose studies investigating 16 second-generation antipsychotics and haloperidol in adults with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia or negative symptoms. We estimated the dose-response curves by conducting random-effects dose-response meta-analyses, utilizing the restricted cubic spline to model the dose-response relationship. The primary outcome was mean weight gain in kg from baseline to endpoint, while the secondary outcome was the number of patients with clinically significant weight gain.

- **Findings**: Ninety-seven studies with 333 dose arms (36,326 participants) provided data for meta-analyses. Most studies were short-term, with a median duration of 6 weeks (range 4 to 26 weeks). In patients with acute exacerbation, amisulpride, aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, cariprazine, haloperidol, lumateperone, and lurasidone produced mild weight gain compared to placebo (mean difference at any dose ≤ 1 kg), while more significant weight gain was observed with all other drugs. For most drugs, dose-response curves showed an initial dose-related increase in weight, which plateaued at higher doses. However, for others, there was no plateau, and some even had bell-shaped curves, indicating less weight gain associated with higher doses.

### Metformin for the prevention of antipsychotic-induced weight gain: Guideline development and consensus validation [^111yvk18]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Low credibility.

Weight gain can be substantial and rapid early in the course of psychosis, with the first year of treatment being critical. A naturalistic cohort study found that individuals with first-episode psychosis gained an average of 3.46 ± 7.81 kg following a mean of 44.6 days of treatment. The trend in weight gain and change in BMI during the first weeks of treatment has been identified as the most clinically significant factor influencing the longer-term risk of adverse cardiometabolic outcomes. In the case of BMI, there is moderate certainty evidence for this association.

Early increases in appetite or changes in eating behavior may predict the risk of weight gain, but the certainty of evidence is low and inconsistent. One study found that increased appetite at 4 weeks was associated with significantly greater weight gain at 12 weeks, with a mean difference of 2.67 kg (95% CI 1.20 to 4.15), P < 0.0001. Eating behavior and raised blood glucose were found to be potential predictors of weight gain.

### Managing weight gain and metabolic issues in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics [^117WXyyf]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

The proven efficacy of second-generation antipsychotics (SGA) has led many clinicians to switch patients from a conventional antipsychotic to an SGA. However, SGAs may be associated with weight gain, dyslipidemia, high blood pressure, and ultimately cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Clinicians should be aware of patients' individual risk factors for developing these illnesses and should carefully screen for changes in weight, body mass index, waist size, or lipid levels that could be potentially harmful and increase the risk for a more serious illness.

### A new genetic locus for antipsychotic-induced weight gain: A genome-wide study of first-episode psychosis patients using amisulpride (from the OPTiMiSE cohort) [^111DnuzE]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

The amount of weight gain during antipsychotic treatment is associated with the type of antipsychotic, pre-treatment body mass index (BMI), sex, symptom reduction, and age. Substantial interindividual differences in antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AiWG) suggest the involvement of genetic mechanisms. A monozygotic twin study confirms this notion by showing a greater similarity of AiWG profiles in monozygotic twins compared to same-sex siblings, resulting in a very high estimated heritability (h²) of 0.8 for AiWG.

Several studies have been conducted to discover and replicate genetic markers related to AiWG. A few genetic loci have been associated with AiWG through genome-wide association studies (GWASs), with rs489693 near the melanocortin 4 receptor gene (MC4R) and rs10977144 on the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type D gene (PTPRD) exceeding the genome-wide significance threshold. Although results on PTPRD were not replicated in European and Afro-American populations, these findings suggest that GWAS is a powerful approach to unravel the genetic polymorphisms underlying AiWG. Understanding the genetics of AiWG has the potential to predict the risk of AiWG before treatment, ultimately promoting compliance and quality of life.

Importantly, all previous AiWG GWASs have been performed on subjects using a range of atypical agents (e.g. quetiapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole), with most study populations comprising different patient subgroups (e.g. pediatric patients and non-medication naïve patients). These agents, and amisulpride in particular, highlight the variability in findings across different therapy and patient contexts.

### Abilify asimtufii [^112yUP2D]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Weight gain has been observed with atypical antipsychotic use. Clinical monitoring of weight is recommended. In one short-term, placebo-controlled trial in adult patients with schizophrenia using Abilify Maintena (once monthly dosing), the mean change in body weight at Week 12 was +3.5 kg (N = 99) in the Abilify Maintena-treated patients and +0.8 kg (N = 66) in the placebo-treated patients.

The study indicated that during a 52-week open-label bipolar I disorder study, 1.8% of patients discontinued Abilify Maintena treatment due to weight increase. Abilify Maintena was associated with a mean increase from baseline in weight of 1.0 kg at Week 52. In this trial, 21.4% of these patients demonstrated a ≥ 7% increase in body weight, while 15.4% demonstrated a ≥ 7% decrease in body weight.

- **Pathological gambling and other compulsive behaviors**: Post-marketing case reports suggest that patients can experience intense urges, particularly for gambling, and an inability to control these urges while taking aripiprazole. Other compulsive urges, reported less frequently, include sexual urges, shopping, eating or binge eating, and other impulsive or compulsive behaviors. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or intense gambling urges and compulsive sexual urges.

### Antipsychotic switching for people with schizophrenia who have neuroleptic-induced weight or metabolic problems [^111mMcTV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Weight gain is common for people with schizophrenia, and this has serious implications for a patient's health and well-being. Switching strategies have been recommended as a management option to address this issue.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effects of antipsychotic medication switching as a strategy for reducing or preventing weight gain and metabolic problems in people with schizophrenia.

- **Search strategy**: We searched key databases and the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's trials register (January 2005 and June 2007), reviewed reference sections within relevant papers, and contacted the first author of each relevant study and other experts to collect further information.

- **Selection criteria**: All clinical randomized controlled trials comparing the switching of antipsychotic medication as an intervention for antipsychotic-induced weight gain and metabolic problems with the continuation of medication and/or other weight loss treatments (pharmacological and non-pharmacological) in people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like illnesses.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Studies were reliably selected, quality assessed, and data extracted. For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis, using a fixed-effect model. The primary outcome measures were weight loss, metabolic syndrome, relapse, and general mental state.

- **Main results**: We included four studies in the review with a total of 636 participants. All except one study had a duration of 26 weeks or less. There was a mean weight loss of 1.94 kg (2 RCT, n = 287, CI -3.9 to 0.08).

### Aripiprazole dose associations with metabolic adverse effect: Results from a longitudinal study [^113YijcK]. Schizophrenia Research (2024). Low credibility.

Weight gain, blood lipids, and/or glucose dysregulation can follow aripiprazole treatment onset. Whether aripiprazole dosage is associated with an increase in these metabolic parameters remains uncertain. This study investigates aripiprazole dose associations with weight change, blood glucose, lipids, and blood pressure.

Four hundred and twenty-two patients taking aripiprazole for a minimum of three weeks to one year were selected from the PsyMetab and PsyClin cohorts. Associations between aripiprazole dose and metabolic outcomes were examined using linear mixed-effect models.

Aripiprazole dose was associated with weight change when considering its interaction with treatment duration (interaction term: -0.10, p < 0.001). This interaction resulted in greater weight gain for high versus low doses at the beginning of the treatment, with this result being overturned at approximately five months, where greater weight increase was observed for low versus high doses thereafter. LDL and HDL cholesterol levels were associated with aripiprazole dose over five months independently of treatment duration, with an average increase of 0.06 and 0.02 mmol/l for each 5 mg increment, respectively (p = 0.033 and p = 0.016, respectively). Furthermore, mean dose increases were associated with greater odds (+30% per 5 mg increase) of clinically relevant weight gain (i.e. ≥ 7%) over one year (p = 0.025).

Aripiprazole dose was associated with one-year weight changes when considering its interaction with treatment duration. Increasing its dose could lead to metabolic worsening over the first five months and a subsequent stabilization or reversal trend depending on continued dosing and treatment duration.

### Metformin for the Prevention of Antipsychotic-Induced Weight Gain: Guideline Development and Consensus Validation [^113iVRLy]. Schizophrenia bulletin (2025). Low credibility.

Additional Guideline Considerations Outside of the Key Health Questions.

In addition to answering the key health questions, important prescribing information, such as common side effects and monitoring recommendations were included in the algorithm.

The scope of this guideline was limited to the use of metformin for the prevention of AIWG. However, the guideline development group was cognizant of the availability of more effective treatments for people living with overweight or obesity. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists have demonstrated a larger effect size than metformin when treating overweight or obesity, including that caused by antipsychotics MD −6 kg (95% CI −10.8 kg to −1.36 kg). Failure to include this information in our algorithm could create hesitancy to intervene to effectively manage existing overweight or obesity in people living with SMI. These treatments should be equally available to people with SMI as the general population. We therefore included the recommendation to initiate GLP-1 agonists according to the licensed indication. The recommendation to initiate GLP-1 agonists is supported by high certainty evidence and these recommendations have been included in national obesity guidelines in Canada and Ireland. Supply problems, cost and prescribing restrictions in certain countries mean accessing these treatments can be challenging and we have therefore included the recommendation to start metformin if access is a problem.

### Olanzapine [^115PLFJp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In long-term studies of at least 48 weeks, the mean weight gain was 5.6 kg (12.3 lb) with a median exposure of 573 days (N = 2,021). The percentages of patients who gained at least 7%, 15%, or 25% of their baseline body weight with long-term exposure were 64%, 32%, and 12%, respectively. Discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 0.4% of olanzapine-treated patients following at least 48 weeks of exposure.

- **Adult weight gain**: Data from 86 clinical trials were pooled in Table 6, showing weight gain among adult patients completing specified treatment durations.

- **Dose group differences**: In a single 8-week randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose study, adult patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were given 10 mg/day (N = 199), 20 mg/day (N = 200), and 40 mg/day (N = 200) of oral olanzapine. Significant differences in baseline to endpoint weight increase were observed: 1.9 kg for 10 mg/day, 2.3 kg for 20 mg/day, and 3 kg for 40 mg/day, with significant differences between 10 mg/day and 40 mg/day.

### Weight change with atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia [^115vtrnX]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2005). Low credibility.

Weight gain is a common complication of antipsychotic treatment. Its consequences include decreased self-esteem, reduced quality of life, reduced adherence to medication, and increased morbidity and mortality. Most studies that assess weight change are short-term. Among atypicals, mean weight gain is greatest with olanzapine and clozapine and least with aripiprazole and ziprasidone. Mean weight change obscures the marked individual variation in weight change that occurs during antipsychotic treatment; irrespective of the antipsychotic, some subjects lose weight, some maintain their weight, and some gain weight.

In several long-term naturalistic studies (> 6 months), mean weight gain is less marked than in randomized controlled trials of a shorter or comparable duration. This may reflect selective prescribing, the effect of weight management interventions, and differences in the statistical analysis employed. With most antipsychotics, weight stabilizes in the short to medium term; however, with clozapine, it may continue beyond the first year. With some drugs, clinical improvement is associated with short-term weight gain.

Predictors of long-term weight gain include lower body mass index, increased appetite, and rapid initial weight increase. Weight gain is greater in first-onset patients due to the lack of prior antipsychotic exposure and associated weight gain. The potential for weight gain should be discussed with patients before starting antipsychotic treatment, and weight should be monitored regularly during treatment. It may be possible to predict weight gain before an antipsychotic is prescribed.

### Antipsychotic-induced insulin resistance and postprandial hormonal dysregulation independent of weight gain or psychiatric disease [^117T8nRh]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Atypical antipsychotic (AAP) medications, which have revolutionized the treatment of mental illness, have become stigmatized by metabolic side effects, including obesity and diabetes. It remains controversial whether these defects are treatment-induced or disease-related. Although the mechanisms underlying these metabolic defects are not fully understood, it is assumed that the initiating pathophysiology is weight gain, secondary to centrally mediated increases in appetite.

To determine if AAPs have detrimental metabolic effects independent of weight gain or psychiatric disease, we administered olanzapine, aripiprazole, or placebo for nine days to healthy subjects (n = 10, each group) under controlled in-patient conditions while maintaining activity levels. Prior to and after the interventions, we conducted a meal challenge and a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp to evaluate insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal.

We found that olanzapine, an AAP highly associated with weight gain, causes significant elevations in postprandial insulin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), and glucagon coincident with insulin resistance compared with placebo. Aripiprazole, considered metabolically sparing, induces insulin resistance but has no effect on postprandial hormones. Importantly, these metabolic changes occur in the absence of weight gain, increases in food intake and hunger, or psychiatric disease, suggesting that AAPs exert direct effects on tissues independent of mechanisms regulating eating behavior.

### Effects of long-term antipsychotics treatment on body weight: A population-based cohort study [^115B2M6t]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

Comparison with other studies

Previous studies have suggested olanzapine is associated with a large short-term weight gain, whereas risperidone and quetiapine have a moderate effect on weight. In the long term, contrary to one previous finding, we found that weight gain did not stabilize during four years of follow-up. However, our finding of the long-term effect of weight gain is consistent with previous studies, but we are able to quantify the effect more accurately.

Previous research has suggested women's weight is more affected by antipsychotic (AP) exposure; however, we found that only olanzapine (in the long term) and quetiapine (in the long and short term) induced more weight gain in women. Since our study population is a mixture of naïve and regular antipsychotic consumers, short- and long-term weight gain in olanzapine-naïve individuals and long-term weight gain in risperidone-naïve individuals can be higher than the weight gain reported by us.

Risperidone seemed to be associated with greater weight gain in men than women both in the short and long term, and men prescribed olanzapine gained more weight in the short term.

- **Dosage**: One recent study reanalyzed results of 14 clinical trials to explore variations in weight gain across doses of olanzapine and risperidone. Their conclusions about olanzapine are consistent with our results; the excess risk of at least 7% weight gain is 16.1% for low doses (0–10 g chlorpromazine equivalent dose) and 46.8% for high doses (0–20 g chlorpromazine equivalent dose). They could not be conclusive about the effects of risperidone.

### Antipsychotic-induced insulin resistance and postprandial hormonal dysregulation independent of weight gain or psychiatric disease [^1174okBm]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

- **Results**

- **Effect of AAP administration on body weight, food intake, and hunger**: The study included 30 participants, with 7 men and 3 women in each experimental condition. There were no dropouts due to study-related adverse events. The primary side effect of olanzapine was drowsiness. Baseline characteristics did not significantly differ among the three groups prior to the interventions. Following olanzapine administration, no significant changes were observed in any variables, except for an increase in fasting plasma insulin (P < 0.05). Aripiprazole did not affect any variables except for an increase in systolic blood pressure relative to placebo.

	- No significant change in weight was observed for either olanzapine (Fig. 1A) or aripiprazole (Fig. 1B) compared with placebo (Fig. 1C), although there was a trend toward weight decrease in the aripiprazole group (P < 0.08), resulting in a difference in weight change compared with olanzapine (P < 0.05). Figure 1D illustrates the mean number of steps taken over five days prior to hospital admission compared with the mean number during the 12-day in-patient period. No differences were found, indicating that activity levels were maintained during the study.

	- Figure 1E shows the cumulative daily score of hunger ratings (four per day, except for metabolic testing days) throughout the study. No significant differences in hunger ratings were found among the interventions. Ad libitum food intake was assessed.

### Effects of long-term antipsychotics treatment on body weight: A population-based cohort study [^113x1BJB]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

Our study has several potential limitations. Information on possible time-varying confounders, such as symptom levels or illness severity, was not included; however, it is reasonable to assume limited variation from patients' baseline values for unmeasured confounders. Treatment initiation was defined using the first prescription date in general practice, but for some individuals, this date might occur while under the care of secondary care mental services. These data are not recorded in primary care. However, it is likely that these patients have a first prescription date close to the one in primary care, thus no major impact on estimates is expected.

We did not control for drugs prescribed to reduce antipsychotic-induced weight gain or for multiple prescriptions of other drugs that could affect weight. However, drugs prescribed for ameliorating weight gain would only reduce the estimate of the real weight gain of the target population. Therefore, we are not overestimating the weight gain effect. We did not assess weight gain associated with other antipsychotic medications due to insufficient data, but the three drugs included in this study are the most commonly prescribed antipsychotic medications in the UK and have previously been associated with weight gain. The weight gain trajectories we described are averages and should be interpreted as typical patient trajectories. In practice, individual patients' weight gain will vary from these average trajectories.

### Effects of long-term antipsychotics treatment on body weight: A population-based cohort study [^112HDFsa]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

Antipsychotics are often prescribed for long-term periods; however, most evidence of their impact on body weight comes from short-term clinical trials. Particularly, the impact associated with dosage has been barely studied.

- **Aims**: The aim of this study was to describe the short- and long-term changes in body weight of people initiated on high or low doses of the three most commonly prescribed second-generation antipsychotics.

- **Methods**: Retrospective cohorts of individuals with a diagnosed psychotic disorder were observed from 2005 to 2015 in UK primary care. The exposure was the first prescription of olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone. The main outcome was a change in body weight four years before and four years after initiation of antipsychotic treatment, stratified by sex and 'low' or 'high' dose.

- **Results**: In total, 22,306 women and 16,559 men were observed. Olanzapine treatment was associated with the highest change in weight, with higher doses resulting in more weight gain. After four years, given a high dose of olanzapine (> 5 mg), women gained on average +6.1 kg, whereas given a low dose (≤ 5 mg), they gained +4.4 kg. During the first six weeks of olanzapine treatment, they gained on average +3.2 kg on a high dose and +1.9 kg on a low dose. The trends were similar for men. Individuals prescribed risperidone and quetiapine experienced less weight gain in both the short- and long-term.

- **Conclusions**: Olanzapine treatment was associated with the highest increase in weight. Higher doses were associated with more weight gain. Doctors should prescribe the lowest effective dose to b

### Zyprexa intramuscular [^1146srg2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2016). Low credibility.

In an analysis of 13 placebo-controlled olanzapine monotherapy studies, olanzapine-treated patients gained an average of 2.6 kg (5.7 lb) compared to an average 0.3 kg (0.6 lb) weight loss in placebo-treated patients, with a median exposure of 6 weeks; 22.2% of olanzapine-treated patients gained at least 7% of their baseline weight, compared to 3% of placebo-treated patients, with a median exposure to event of 8 weeks; 4.2% of olanzapine-treated patients gained at least 15% of their baseline weight, compared to 0.3% of placebo-treated patients, with a median exposure to event of 12 weeks. Clinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline body mass index (BMI) categories. Discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 0.2% of olanzapine-treated patients and in 0% of placebo-treated patients.

In long-term studies (at least 48 weeks), the mean weight gain was 5.6 kg (12.3 lb) (median exposure of 573 days, N = 2021). The percentages of patients who gained at least 7%, 15%, or 25% of their baseline body weight with long-term exposure were 64%, 32%, and 12%, respectively. Discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 0.4% of olanzapine-treated patients following at least 48 weeks of exposure.

- **Olanzapine monotherapy in adults**: Includes data on adult weight gain with olanzapine pooled from 86 clinical trials. The data in each column represent data for those patients who completed treatment periods of the durations specified.

- **Dose group differences**: Dose group differences with respect to weight gain have been observed. In a single 8-week randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose study.

### Geodon [^117BBLZb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

- **Weight gain**: The proportions of patients meeting a weight gain criterion of ≥ 7% of body weight were compared in a pool of four 4- and 6-week placebo-controlled schizophrenia clinical trials, revealing a statistically significantly greater incidence of weight gain for ziprasidone (10%) compared to placebo (4%). A median weight gain of 0.5 kg was observed in ziprasidone patients compared to no median weight change in placebo patients. In this set of clinical trials, weight gain was reported as an adverse reaction in 0.4% of both ziprasidone and placebo patients, respectively. During long-term therapy with ziprasidone, a categorization of patients at baseline on the basis of body mass index (BMI) revealed the greatest mean weight gain and highest incidence of clinically significant weight gain (> 7% of body weight) in patients with low BMI. There was a mean weight gain of 1.4 kg for those patients with a "low" baseline BMI, no mean change for patients with a "normal" BMI, and a 1.3 kg mean weight loss for patients who entered the program with a "high" BMI.

- **ECG changes**: Ziprasidone is associated with an increase in the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In the schizophrenia trials, ziprasidone was associated with a mean increase in heart rate of 1.4 beats per minute compared to a 0.2 beats per minute decrease among placebo patients.

### Exploring weight gain in year before treatment for binge eating disorder: A different context for interpreting limited weight losses in treatment studies [^115fe9rC]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

To examine weight changes in obese patients with binge-eating disorder (BED) during the year before seeking treatment and to explore correlates of weight changes, seventy-eight consecutive, treatment-seeking, obese BED patients were assessed with structured interviews and self-report questionnaires.

Overall, participants reported a mean weight gain of 15.1 pounds during the 12 months before treatment. This overall weight gain comprised remarkable heterogeneity, ranging from a 30-pound loss to a 53-pound gain. The subgroup of participants who reported gaining weight (76% of the sample) reported gaining an average of 22.2 pounds during the 12 months before treatment. Weight change was associated with significantly more frequent binge eating and overeating during breakfasts.

Treatment-seeking obese patients with BED reported having gained substantial amounts of weight during the previous year. These findings provide an important context for interpreting the modest weight losses typically reported by treatment studies of BED.

### Metformin for the prevention of antipsychotic-induced weight gain: Guideline development and consensus validation [^112hD56s]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for bipolar disorder, specifically in preventing antipsychotic-induced weight gain, the AIWG-ICG 2024 guidelines recommend co-prescribing metformin with medium-risk antipsychotics, such as quetiapine, paliperidone, or risperidone, to prevent antipsychotic-induced weight gain in patients with cardiometabolic risk factors or those aged 10–25 years.

### Metformin for the prevention of antipsychotic-induced weight gain: Guideline development and consensus validation [^116bvDsX]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Low credibility.

The choice of antipsychotic has been found to be the most important nongenetic factor at baseline for predicting antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG). There is low certainty evidence for this association. The side effect profile of the antipsychotic agent is an important factor in the decision regarding which antipsychotic medication is commenced first. While not everyone prescribed antipsychotics with higher cardiometabolic adverse effect profiles will experience clinically significant weight gain, at present, there is no accurate clinic-ready means to predict worse cardiometabolic outcomes in psychosis at the individual level.

Prognostic tools for the psychosis population are advanced in the development pipeline and may be suitable for inclusion in future updates to this guidance. Nevertheless, modeling of over 1100 first episode psychosis (FEP) cases in the UK found that even antipsychotics with higher cardiometabolic risk can be prescribed, and cardiometabolic risk lowered over time, so long as other factors, including weight gain, are carefully addressed. Therefore, in lieu of a clinically available tool to predict cardiometabolic outcomes in this population, as part of shared decision-making, all people with first episode psychosis should be offered an antipsychotic with low risk of cardiometabolic side effects where possible at the lowest effective dose. Yet, if high- or medium-risk medicines are necessary, prevention strategies, for example, the early use of metformin, should be targeted at these groups.

Multiple network meta-analyses have reviewed the risk of cardiometabolic side effects with antipsychotic treatments.

### Is clozapine-induced weight gain dose-dependent? Results from a prospective cohort study [^1168Khmo]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2023). Low credibility.

Table 1 compares clinical variables between patients whose total average dose during the follow-up was less than 200 or greater than or equal to 200 mg/day. Patients receiving higher doses were more likely to be smokers (P = .001), diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (P < 0.001), had higher weight at baseline (P = .02), and were younger (P < 0.001). Notably, most adults (64.8%) were taking doses ≥ 200 mg/day, in contrast to older patients, who mainly took doses < 200 mg/day (60.7%).

- **Comparison of clinical variables among patients receiving an average of < 200 or ≥ 200 mg/day**: Treatment duration and dose were significantly associated with weight change over one year, with a 0.50% increase in weight for each additional month (P < 0.001), and a 0.48% increase in weight for each 100 mg dose increase (P = .004). Applying the piecewise function at a dose value of 200 mg/day, the weight increase for each additional 100 mg was +0.59% for doses ≥ 200 mg/day, for example, dose increases from 300 to 400 mg/day (P = .001), and +1.12% for doses < 200 mg/day, for example, dose increases from 20 to 120 mg/day (P = .003).

Since weight gain can occur rapidly in the first three months of treatment, the piecewise function was also applied to the treatment duration covariate at 3 months. The dose effects were evaluated before and after this cutoff. The estimated weight increase for each additional month was +0.47% for treatment duration values greater than 3 months and +0.84% for treatment duration values up to 3 months (P < 0.001). The dose was significantly associated with weight change over the treatment duration.

### Therapeutic effectiveness and tolerability of aripiprazole as initial choice of treatment in first episode psychosis in an early intervention service: A one-year outcome study [^113vmifF]. Schizophrenia Research (2016). Low credibility.

Aripiprazole has been associated with a low prevalence of metabolic side effects as compared to other second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) medications, mostly in patients with long-standing illness. The purpose of the present study was to assess specifically the effectiveness and safety of aripiprazole as a first choice for antipsychotic therapy for young patients presenting with a previously untreated first episode of a psychotic disorder (FEP).

- **Methods**: Seventy-three patients presenting with an FEP and with minimal prior exposure to antipsychotic medications were recruited to be part of an open-label naturalistic outcome study using aripiprazole as the first choice of antipsychotic medication. Data on positive, negative, and total symptom severity, including general psychopathological symptoms, level of functioning, and metabolic indices, were collected prospectively over a one-year period.

- **Results**: As compared to baseline, patients treated with aripiprazole (mean dose 9.6 mg) improved significantly on measures of positive, negative, and general psychopathology symptoms. Significant improvement was observed on overall functioning. Only four patients (5.5%) experienced a > 7% increase in body weight.

- **Conclusion**: FEP patients starting treatment with aripiprazole improved on symptoms and so did overall functioning, with minimal metabolic side effects reported.

### Antipsychotic-induced insulin resistance and postprandial hormonal dysregulation independent of weight gain or psychiatric disease [^11591QNH]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Atypical antipsychotic (AAP) medications, which have revolutionized the treatment of mental illness, have become stigmatized due to metabolic side effects, including obesity and diabetes. It remains controversial whether these defects are treatment-induced or disease-related. Although the mechanisms underlying these metabolic defects are not completely understood, it is often assumed that the initiating pathophysiology is weight gain secondary to centrally mediated increases in appetite.

To determine if AAPs have detrimental metabolic effects independent of weight gain or psychiatric disease, we administered olanzapine, aripiprazole, or placebo for 9 days to healthy subjects (n = 10 for each group) under controlled in-patient conditions while maintaining activity levels. Prior to and following the interventions, we conducted a meal challenge and a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp to evaluate insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal.

We found that olanzapine, an AAP highly associated with weight gain, causes significant elevations in postprandial insulin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), and glucagon coincident with insulin resistance compared with placebo. Aripiprazole, an AAP considered metabolically sparing, induces insulin resistance but has no effect on postprandial hormones. Importantly, these metabolic changes occur in the absence of weight gain, increases in food intake and hunger, or psychiatric disease, suggesting that AAPs exert direct effects on tissues independent of mechanisms regulating eating behavior.

### Effects of long-term antipsychotics treatment on body weight: A population-based cohort study [^115dwRP4]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

This retrospective cohort study reports data from patients seen in primary care before and after antipsychotic (AP) treatment initiation. Pre-treatment weight change was insignificant or slightly negative for all cohorts during the four years before baseline. Individuals starting treatment with any AP gained weight on average, with a pronounced increase in those prescribed olanzapine. Weight gain was much more rapid in the short-term than in the long-term. People who initiated high-dose AP treatment experienced significantly greater absolute weight gain than those on low-dose AP. Cumulative weight gain during the long-term was particularly high in individuals treated with olanzapine, but for all APs, individuals typically did not lose the extra weight gained during the first six weeks of AP treatment.

- **Strengths and limitations of this study**: This study presents evidence from a large sample (n > 38,000) of people prescribed antipsychotic medications, taken from a population broadly representative of the UK. Patients prescribed antipsychotics often undergo long-term treatment, making it crucial to quantify the risk of long-term side effects. Clinical trials often do not achieve this due to their short durations and much smaller sample sizes. Thus, this study provides a necessary long-term perspective. We applied an analysis approach not previously used in assessing AP-induced weight gain. A major advantage of our approach is the inclusion of pre-treatment weight change information, allowing patients to act as their own controls in the analysis where additional insights are provided…

### Substantial weight gains are common prior to treatment-seeking in obese patients with binge eating disorder [^116ZcK8p]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

This study examined weight trajectories in obese patients with binge eating disorder (BED) during the year prior to treatment initiation and explored potential correlates of these weight changes. One hundred thirty (N = 130) consecutive, treatment-seeking, obese patients with BED were assessed with structured interviews and self-report questionnaires. Eighty-three percent (83%; n = 108) of treatment-seeking obese BED patients gained weight, and 65% (n = 84) gained a clinically significant amount of weight (greater than or equal to 5% body weight) in the year preceding treatment. Overall, participants reported a mean percent weight gain of 8% (16.6 pounds) during the 12 months prior to treatment, with a wide range of weight changes across participants (from a 52% weight gain to a 13% weight loss).

- **High weight gainers**: A substantial proportion of patients (35%), categorized as high weight gainers (defined as gaining more than 10% of body weight during the previous year), reported gaining an average of 16.7% of body weight.

- **Low weight gainers**: This group, defined as gaining greater than 5% but less than 10%, comprised 29% of the sample and was characterized by a mean gain of 6.9% of body weight.

- **Weight maintainers/losers**: This group, defined as having maintained or lost weight during the 12 months prior to treatment, comprised 17% of the sample and reported losing on average 2.8% of body weight.

These three groups did not differ significantly in their weight and eating behaviors or eating disorder psychopathology. The majority of treatment-seeking obese patients with BED reported having gained substantial amounts of weight.

The most common reason for switching from olanzapine is excessive weight gain. Antipsychotic drugs differ in their propensity to cause weight gain: olanzapine and clozapine cause the most; quetiapine and risperidone cause some; ziprasidone, aripiprazole, amisulpride, and haloperidol cause little or no weight gain. There are wide individual differences among patients on a given drug: some patients gain substantial weight, others gain little, some gain none, and some lose weight.

The time course of weight gain is fairly rapid in the first few weeks, but slows down and seems to plateau after several months. Young patients (that is, children, adolescents, and young adults) are much more liable to gain a substantial amount of weight. The rank ordering of antipsychotic weight gain propensity is similar in younger patients; however, even haloperidol causes substantial weight gain among young patients. Patients who had previously been on a high weight-gaining antipsychotic are much less liable to gain more than those who were not.

It is important, therefore, to weigh patients approximately every week in the first few months of their treatment and then less frequently afterwards. Substantial weight gain is associated with type-2 diabetes and, for some patients, the consequences of obesity must be regarded as a serious medical event. If it is apparent that a given patient is likely to gain a lot of weight, the clinician is faced with limiting weight gain by diet, exercise, pharmacological intervention, or by switching to another drug.

### Lyrica CR [^111zvqJ5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Lyrica CR treatment may cause weight gain. In Lyrica CR controlled trials for pain indications, weight gain was experienced by 4% of Lyrica CR-treated patients during the single-blind phase. Adverse events of weight gain were observed in 3.7% of Lyrica CR-treated patients and 1% of placebo-treated patients during the double-blind phase.

In Lyrica controlled clinical trials of up to 14 weeks, a gain of 7% or more over baseline weight was observed in 9% of Lyrica-treated patients and 2% of placebo-treated patients. Few patients treated with Lyrica (0.3%) withdrew from controlled trials due to weight gain. In studies with Lyrica, associated weight gain was related to pregabalin dose and duration of exposure but did not appear to be associated with baseline BMI, gender, or age. Weight gain was not limited to patients with edema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Although weight gain was not associated with clinically important changes in blood pressure in short-term controlled studies with Lyrica, the long-term cardiovascular effects of pregabalin-associated weight gain are unknown.

Among diabetic patients, Lyrica-treated patients gained an average of 1.6 kg (range: -16 to 16 kg), compared to an average 0.3 kg (range: -10 to 9 kg) weight gain in placebo patients. In a cohort of 333 diabetic patients who received Lyrica for at least 2 years, the average weight gain was 5.2 kg.

While the effects of pregabalin-associated weight gain on glycemic control have not been systematically assessed, in controlled and longer-term open-label clinical trials with diabetic patients, further investigation is warranted.

### Weight gain in antipsychotic-naive patients: A review and meta-analysis [^1163Tura]. Psychological Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Weight gain is a long-recognized side effect of antipsychotic (AP) drugs and a major health concern in the treatment of psychosis. The strength of the causal relationship between AP drug exposure and weight gain can only be gauged by a drug trial conducted on AP-naive patients. We conducted a review of the literature regarding the amount of weight gain induced by APs in AP-naive patients and carried out a meta-analysis of mean weight gains.

We found 11 primary studies reporting the effects of APs on body weight or body mass index (BMI) in AP-naive patients. The mean body weight and BMI gains in AP-naive patients were highly significant from the first weeks of treatment. When we limited the analysis to studies conducted on patients hospitalized and without any adjunctive treatment potentially affecting weight, the resultant sample showed less heterogeneity and confirmed the final picture of weight gain at around 3.8 kg and 1.2 points BMI.

Weight gain associated with AP therapy in AP-naive patients occurs rapidly in the first few weeks and continues during the following months. Clinicians should be aware of the high probability of causing weight gain in AP-naive patients and should strictly monitor such patients.

### A new genetic locus for antipsychotic-induced weight gain: A genome-wide study of first-episode psychosis patients using amisulpride (from the optimise cohort) [^112x8phq]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

A very harmful side effect of antipsychotics is antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AiWG). A three-year observational study reports clinically relevant AiWG (⩾7% of baseline weight) in up to 45% of participants on antipsychotics, resulting in a shift from normal weight to overweight in up to 15% of these patients. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) often follows AiWG; the relative risk of developing MetS after antipsychotic treatment initiation compared to unmedicated schizophrenia patients is up to 2.57. Schizophrenia patients on average have a 20% decreased life expectancy, with cardiovascular disease ranking as the leading cause of death. In addition, AiWG may hamper treatment efficacy as it reduces adherence. Furthermore, AiWG reduces quality of life by 12%.

Meta-analyses assessing the efficacy and safety of 15 antipsychotics in schizophrenia show superior efficacy and a relatively favorable safety profile for amisulpride. Study results on the amount of weight gain induced by amisulpride vary, and it seems that amisulpride carries a lower weight gain risk at prolonged exposure than other antipsychotics. Previous meta-analyses that also incorporated long-term studies classify the compound as low risk or even weight neutral. In contrast, a short-term study categorizes amisulpride as a mid-risk compound for AiWG with an average weight gain of 2.3 kg after six weeks of treatment. A recent meta-analysis confirms the categorization as a mid-risk compound. This antipsychotic compound has a unique pharmacological profile with high potency for the D2 and D3 dopamine receptors.

### Weight gain and antipsychotic medication: Differences between antipsychotic-free and treatment periods [^111GmLyE]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

We performed a retrospective analysis of data involving 121 inpatients to examine the rate of weight gain during antipsychotic-free periods and during treatment with various antipsychotic drugs.

- **Method**: Data were analyzed to determine differences in weekly weight change during antipsychotic-free (N = 65), typical antipsychotic (N = 51), or atypical antipsychotic (N = 130) treatment periods. Atypical antipsychotic treatment periods were further subdivided into olanzapine (N = 45), clozapine (N = 47), or risperidone (N = 36) treatment periods. A paired comparison was conducted on 65 patients who had an antipsychotic-free treatment period preceding or following a neuroleptic drug treatment period. In addition, patients were classified as either non-obese or obese (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30.0 kg/m²) to test whether the rate of weight gain during treatment periods was related to initial BMI.

- **Results**: Across all treatment periods, weekly weight gain was as follows: 0.89 lb/wk (0.40 kg/wk) on atypical antipsychotic medication, 0.61 lb/wk (0.27 kg/wk) on typical antipsychotic medication, and 0.21 lb/wk (0.09 kg/wk) on no antipsychotic medications. The atypical antipsychotic versus antipsychotic-free comparison was significant (F = 3.51; df = 2,231; p = .031), while the typical antipsychotic versus antipsychotic-free comparison was not. Among the individual atypical antipsychotic medications, significantly more weight gain occurred during olanzapine treatment (1.70 lb/wk) (0.76 kg/wk) than with clozapine (0.50 lb/wk) (0.22 kg/wk).

### Risperdal [^116MPJ9X]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Weight gain has been observed in children and adolescents during treatment with Risperdal. Clinical monitoring of weight is recommended during treatment. Data derive from short-term placebo-controlled trials and longer-term uncontrolled studies in pediatric patients (ages 5 to 17 years) with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autistic disorder, or other psychiatric disorders. In the short-term trials (3 to 8 weeks), the mean weight gain for Risperdal-treated patients was 2 kg, compared to 0.6 kg for placebo-treated patients. In these trials, approximately 33% of the Risperdal group had weight gain ≥ 7%, compared to 7% in the placebo group. In longer-term, uncontrolled, open-label pediatric studies, the mean weight gain was 5.5 kg at Week 24 and 8 kg at Week 48 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

- **Somnolence**: Somnolence was frequently observed in placebo-controlled clinical trials of pediatric patients with autistic disorder. Most cases were mild or moderate in severity. These events were most often of early onset, with peak incidence occurring during the first two weeks of treatment, and transient, with a median duration of 16 days. Somnolence was the most commonly observed adverse reaction in the clinical trial of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents, as well as in the schizophrenia trials in adolescents. As was seen in the autistic disorder trials, these adverse reactions were most often of early onset and transient in duration [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)].

### Antipsychotic-induced insulin resistance and postprandial hormonal dysregulation independent of weight gain or psychiatric disease [^113r8Gz8]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

In summary, we have demonstrated that olanzapine induces insulin resistance and postprandial metabolic dysregulation in response to the real-life stimulus of meal ingestion. Postprandial hyperinsulinemia may be one of the early precipitating factors in the pathophysiology of olanzapine administration, contributing to fat deposition. We have also shown that aripiprazole, an AAP considered metabolically sparing, has modest effects on insulin sensitivity. These data suggest direct and differential effects of the AAPs on insulin-sensitive tissues in the absence of psychiatric disease, weight gain, or increases in hunger.

The rapidly induced metabolic impairments are likely mediated by mechanisms separate from those regulating food intake, as we did not observe increases in food intake, hunger, or the hunger-related hormone ghrelin. With longer olanzapine administration, AAP-induced central nervous system effects would likely mediate the increased food intake necessary for the known weight gain, and this would then exacerbate the metabolic effects reported here. Our findings suggest that interventions inhibiting weight gain in AAP-treated patients may be only partially effective in preventing metabolic disease, since the drugs are exerting direct effects on tissue function.

Developing AAPs without the debilitating metabolic side effects will depend on the individual contribution of the different neurotransmitters and also on the complex interaction between the peripheral and central nervous system and their effects on behavior and metabolism.

### Antipsychotic-induced insulin resistance and postprandial hormonal dysregulation independent of weight gain or psychiatric disease [^1116VLwn]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Here, we show that short-term administration of the atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) olanzapine and aripiprazole induces insulin resistance in healthy subjects. However, only olanzapine results in significant changes in postprandial metabolism following a mixed-meal challenge. Olanzapine was found to elicit hyperinsulinemia as well as acute increases in postprandial GLP-1 and small elevations in glucagon concentrations. The rapidly induced metabolic dysregulation occurred in the absence of weight gain and psychiatric disease, independent of changes in hunger or food intake, as indicated by our behavioral and metabolic data. These results confirm that olanzapine exerts direct effects on insulin-sensitive tissues and suggest that the mechanisms regulating the increase in food intake may be distinct from those mediating the metabolic abnormalities.

Unique to the study is the use of the mixed-nutrient meal challenge to unveil olanzapine-induced changes in postprandial responses. One of the most notable findings is the magnitude and consistency of the postprandial hyperinsulinemia. Nine out of ten subjects exhibited an increase in postprandial insulin AUC compared with baseline, with 6 out of 10 subjects doubling their insulin response. Olanzapine-induced increases in postprandial insulin have not previously been documented; investigation has been limited to studies that had insufficient postmeal sampling frequency or did not use a mixed-nutrient stimulus.

### Lyrica [^115d798x]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Lyrica treatment may cause weight gain. In controlled clinical trials lasting up to 14 weeks in adult patients, a gain of 7% or more over baseline weight was observed in 9% of Lyrica-treated patients and 2% of placebo-treated patients. Few patients treated with Lyrica (0.3%) withdrew from the trials due to weight gain. Lyrica-associated weight gain was related to dose and duration of exposure but did not appear to be associated with baseline BMI, gender, or age. Weight gain was not limited to patients with edema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Although weight gain was not associated with clinically important changes in blood pressure in short-term studies, the long-term cardiovascular effects of Lyrica-associated weight gain are unknown. Among diabetic patients, Lyrica-treated patients gained an average of 1.6 kg (range: -16 to 16 kg), compared to an average 0.3 kg (range: -10 to 9 kg) weight gain in placebo patients. In a cohort of 333 diabetic patients who received Lyrica for at least 2 years, the average weight gain was 5.2 kg.

While the effects of Lyrica-associated weight gain on glycemic control have not been systematically assessed, Lyrica treatment did not appear to be associated with loss of glycemic control (as measured by HbA1C) in controlled and longer-term open label trials.

In standard preclinical in vivo lifetime carcinogenicity studies of Lyrica, an unexpectedly high incidence of hemangiosarcoma was identified in two different strains of mice.

### A new genetic locus for antipsychotic-induced weight gain: A genome-wide study of first-episode psychosis patients using amisulpride (from the OPTiMiSE cohort) [^117HSgrL]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

Our GWAS and lookup results hint that the genetic mechanisms underlying antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AiWG) differ between amisulpride and other antipsychotics. Various mechanisms have been proposed in AiWG involving different receptors, mostly suggesting an increase in appetite and a delay in satiety signaling. Although the blockade of 5HT2C by olanzapine and clozapine induces food craving and binge eating, D2 receptor (D2R)-mediated pathways likely play a more important role in agents with high D2R affinity, such as amisulpride. D2R blockade can cause weight gain by inducing hormonal dysregulation via prolactin increase or increasing food intake by disrupted reward processing.

The strengths of our study include the collection of a homogeneous set of minimally medicated first-episode, adult patients using the same antipsychotic. In addition, phenotypic data were meticulously collected, allowing for correction of several important potentially confounding variables. Some limitations should, however, be borne in mind when interpreting our results. The sample size for this GWAS remained in the mid-range compared to previous AiWG GWASs, which used discovery sets of n = 139, n = 189, and n = 534. In addition, a replication cohort was lacking for the analyses. Collecting another cohort with minimally medicated psychosis patients on amisulpride will likely require many years. Ideally, a well-powered study targeting over a thousand first-episode patients who are treated with, for example, amisulpride and olanzapine will allow for mega-analyses and thereby increased accuracy.

### Weight gain with atypical antipsychotics: Evidence and insights [^111VCgAn]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Weight gain associated with antipsychotic medication can be a barrier to the overall improvement of mental health patients due to a discontinuation of treatment. The goal of this article is to establish a better understanding of the mechanisms of antipsychotic medications and their associated risk of weight gain, obesity, and subsequent mortality and morbidity. Additionally, the need to closely monitor patients' lifestyles and homeostatic components to prevent weight gain or facilitate weight loss is emphasized.

### Weight gain as a prognostic indicator of therapeutic improvement during acute treatment of schizophrenia with placebo or active antipsychotic [^114ZzATs]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2005). Low credibility.

Treatment-emergent weight gain may be a general marker of therapeutic improvement, even when improvements occur in the absence of active antipsychotic treatment. To investigate the association between treatment-emergent weight gain and therapeutic improvement across placebo and active treatments and to examine the association between reported treatment-emergent weight changes and the treatments' reported efficacy, data from a randomized, double-blind trial comparing treatment of schizophrenia with placebo and olanzapine were used to correlate weight change and change in psychopathology. Additionally, we correlated effect sizes of the efficacy of clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, haloperidol, and placebo (reported in meta-analytical reviews) with their reported weight changes.

Weight gain significantly correlated with clinical improvements for placebo and olanzapine. The correlation between treatments' efficacy and corresponding weight changes was high (r 0.88, p 0.05). Treatment-emergent weight gain appears to be an important marker of symptom reduction and may not be exclusively attributable to pharmacological perturbations.

### Effects of long-term antipsychotics treatment on body weight: A population-based cohort study [^1161WBy2]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

Baseline characteristics of patients from olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone cohorts were stratified by sex. From height onwards, some continuous variables changed their scale, as labeled below their names.

In both the short term (< 6 weeks) and the long term (⩾ 6 weeks to ≤ 4 years), individuals treated with any of the three antipsychotic (AP) drugs gained weight, especially those prescribed olanzapine. Pre-treatment weight change was negligible for the quetiapine (women and men) and risperidone (men only) cohorts, and slightly negative for the rest of the cohorts. In the short term after olanzapine initiation, men's weight increased by 0.569 kg/week (3.4 kg over the first six weeks) and women's weight increased by 0.382 kg/week (2.3 kg over the first six weeks) [refer to Tables 1 and 2]. Individuals initiated on quetiapine and risperidone also gained weight shortly after the initiation of treatment, but to a lesser extent.

Individuals continued to gain weight after six weeks, but at a slower rate than in the first six weeks. For example, for women initiated on olanzapine, long-term weight gain was estimated to be 0.014 kg/week (0.7 kg per year). Women who were initiated on olanzapine were generally slightly lighter (69.7 kg) than women initiated on risperidone (73.3 kg) and quetiapine (70.1 kg), but there was not much difference for men regarding weight at baseline. Women who had a lower weight before the initiation of olanzapine gained more weight in the short term than women who had a higher weight.

### Centrally-acting opioid receptor antagonists as a treatment for antipsychotic-induced weight gain: A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trial data [^115kesfS]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Low credibility.

Our findings indicate that olanzapine/samidorphan partially mitigates AIWG when compared against olanzapine. We did not find any effect of naltrexone alone or in combination with bupropion on AIWG.

The effect on reducing weight gain appears smaller than comparable treatment options, such as GLP-1 receptor agonists and metformin, at face value. However, this difference may be related to study design factors, and direct head-to-head trials would be beneficial.

Overall, our findings potentially point to CORA only having a narrow use case in AIWG, in the presence of other available options. While treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists and metformin may be better established, the former is administered by injection, and both are medication groups not typically prescribed by psychiatrists. Instead, they typically fall into the domain of endocrinologists and general practitioners, who prescribe them for Type 2 diabetes mellitus. This may limit access to those medications without the involvement of the appropriate specialists.

Furthermore, there is developing concern regarding the development of suicidal ideation among patients prescribed GLP-1 receptor agonists, though such links remain unproven with surveillance remaining ongoing. Aripiprazole — whether as an adjunct or in place of the patient's regular antipsychotic — is another option described in guidelines by the British Association of Psychopharmacology and Maudsley. However, this may involve either reducing or discontinuing the patient's regular antipsychotic or exposing the patient to high combinatory effects.

### Weight effects associated with antipsychotics: a comprehensive database analysis [^117PrdLg]. Schizophrenia Research (2009). Low credibility.

Available data on atypical antipsychotic-induced weight gain are limited by several methodological factors. The objective of this report is to evaluate short-term (N = 1742) and long-term (N = 1649) weight effects in patients receiving standard doses of amisulpride, haloperidol, olanzapine, risperidone, ziprasidone, and placebo based on 21 randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies from an integrated clinical trial database.

- **Method**: Analyses of the integrated ziprasidone schizophrenia trials database were performed to estimate the weighted average of weight change and the percentage of subjects experiencing weight gain (or weight loss) across studies for each agent studied, based on fixed- and random-effects models. Durations of treatment exposure in long-term trials were controlled by well-defined time windows (6 months: 150 to 210 days; 1 year: 330 to 390 days). Weight gain or loss was defined using a 7% change from baseline threshold.

- **Results**: During long-term therapy with a 1-year treatment duration, the incidence of weight gain for subjects treated with ziprasidone (17%) was not significantly different from the placebo (13%) or haloperidol (41%) groups based on a 95% confidence interval. In contrast, significantly greater weight gain incidence was observed for the olanzapine (57%) and risperidone (39%) groups compared to placebo. Median weight change of +0.49, -0.18, +1.50, and +0.55 lb/month was observed for haloperidol, ziprasidone, olanzapine, and risperidone subjects, respectively, indicating differential weight change patterns compared to placebo.

### Antipsychotic-associated weight gain and clinical outcome parameters [^113KT7Ey]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Weight gain has been observed with many antipsychotics, including atypical antipsychotics. The assessment of whether, and to what degree, a drug causes changes in body weight is not straightforward. This complexity arises because clinical studies performed during a drug development program are not designed to measure changes in body weight specifically. Even when weight change data are obtained from adverse event data or as part of the vital signs measured during a study, the assessment is not standardized. Nevertheless, evidence indicates that weight gain with atypical antipsychotics is becoming an increasing problem. This review examines whether antipsychotic-associated weight gain, when it occurs, is associated with clinical outcome parameters.

### Review of atypical antipsychotics and weight gain [^117JG9XR]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Prescribing an antipsychotic for a patient with schizophrenia requires a risk-benefit analysis. Weight gain has become an issue recently due to reports that two of the atypical antipsychotic agents, clozapine and olanzapine, are associated with a higher risk than other drugs for causing excessive weight gain. Some degree of weight gain may occur with any atypical antipsychotic agent, particularly early in treatment. A more important consideration is the long-term effects of atypical antipsychotics on body weight, since many patients in this population require chronic therapy. This is crucial because weight gain is an adverse effect associated with noncompliance and medical problems.

In this article, recent reports about the weight effects of different atypical antipsychotic drugs are reviewed. To provide an accurate understanding of the effects of atypical antipsychotic agents, data analyses should include both short-term and long-term findings, the relationship of changes in body weight to pretreatment body mass index (BMI), the relationship to dose, both intent-to-treat and complete analyses, and presentation of both mean and median changes in weight. It is also important to know whether the studies have been conducted in an inpatient or outpatient setting, since patients who are institutionalized may be less likely to exhibit increases in body weight. Such complete information and multidimensional analysis would minimize obfuscation about the true nature of a drug's impact on body weight.

### Effects of long-term antipsychotics treatment on body weight: A population-based cohort study [^116fjjWG]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

Cumulative weight gain in the long term was particularly high in patients prescribed olanzapine; however, on average, individuals did not lose the extra weight gained during the short-term period. For example, after four years from the first olanzapine prescription, a typical woman gained 2.3 kg (short-term, 95% CI: 1.9–2.7 kg) + 2.8 kg (long-term, 95% CI: 2.2–3.5 kg) = 5.1 kg in total, whereas a typical man gained 3.4 kg (short-term, 95% CI: 3.0–3.8 kg) + 1.7 kg (long-term, 95% CI: 0.9–2.4 kg) = 5.1 kg in total of antipsychotic-induced extra weight.

The prescribed dose of olanzapine was also critical, particularly for women in the long term. For example, given a low dose (5 mg), women gained a total of 6.1 kg (3.2 kg short-term + 2.9 kg long-term). A similar impact of higher doses was observed for quetiapine and risperidone.
