## Question

Is digoxin safe with GFR of 46

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether digoxin is safe to use in a patient with an estimated GFR of 46 mL/min/1.73 m², and if so, how to dose and monitor it safely. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify this level of renal function and what that means for digoxin clearance. Then, I should verify the pharmacokinetics and toxicity risk in CKD. Next, I will review authoritative dosing guidance and reconcile any discrepancies. After that, I need to check monitoring requirements, including serum digoxin concentration targets and sampling timing. Finally, I will consider special populations, drug interactions, and synthesize a practical, risk-mitigated recommendation with caveats and follow-up plans.

> Let me first confirm the renal function category. An eGFR of 46 mL/min/1.73 m² corresponds to CKD stage 3b, which is moderate impairment, and for renally cleared drugs like digoxin this materially reduces clearance and prolongs half-life, increasing the risk of accumulation and toxicity if dosing is not adjusted [^c554c372].

> I need to check the pharmacokinetics. Digoxin is predominantly renally eliminated, with about 50–70% excreted unchanged in urine; as kidney function declines, elimination slows and the effective half-life extends, so steady state takes longer and toxicity risk rises if doses are not reduced, especially in older adults or those with low lean body mass [^8a32bc9f] [^c554c372] [^50eac19e].

> Next, I should review authoritative dosing guidance. The FDA labeling advises reducing the maintenance dose in eGFR 20–50 mL/min/1.73 m² to a maximum of 125–250 mcg (0.125–0.25 mg) once daily, with consideration of longer intervals between doses and close monitoring for toxicity; this aligns with the ACC/AHA heart failure guidance to use 0.125 mg daily or every other day in patients with impaired renal function or low lean mass, and to avoid routine loading in heart failure [^d4752db1] [^ad63c4df] [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single fixed dose. I initially thought "start 0.125 mg daily", but wait, I should verify whether 0.0625 mg daily might be safer in frail, elderly, or borderline eGFR patients; indeed, the ACC/AHA and contemporary AF guidelines endorse 0.0625–0.125 mg daily in many older adults or those with renal impairment, so 0.125 mg daily is acceptable but 0.0625 mg daily is a reasonable starting point in higher-risk patients, with titration to effect and levels [^ad63c4df] [^81abacb4].

> I should confirm monitoring requirements. Serum digoxin concentration should be checked just before the next dose (trough) after steady state is reached, which is about 5–7 days in moderate CKD, and interpreted in clinical context; therapeutic targets of 0.5–0.9 ng/mL are associated with benefit and lower toxicity risk, whereas levels above 1.2 ng/mL are linked to increased mortality and toxicity, and levels above 2.0 ng/mL are commonly toxic, especially with electrolyte disturbances [^b3021d75] [^ad63c4df] [^81abacb4] [^50eac19e].

> Let me consider electrolytes and drug interactions that amplify risk. Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypercalcemia increase digoxin toxicity even at "therapeutic" levels, and common co-therapies like loop/thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors/ARBs, and interacting drugs (e.g., amiodarone, verapamil, macrolides, dronedarone, telmisartan) can raise digoxin concentrations; I should double-check for these and correct electrolytes before and during therapy and adjust the dose when adding interacting agents [^a481efeb] [^50eac19e] [^dc6c68c6] [^7a54a8d1].

> I will now examine special populations. In older adults, the AGS Beers Criteria advise avoiding digoxin doses above 0.125 mg/day due to toxicity risk with reduced renal clearance; in nursing home cohorts, digoxin is frequently prescribed despite reduced GFR, underscoring the need for explicit dose reduction and monitoring plans in this group [^24cbcc37] [^ca356705].

> But wait, what if the patient is on dialysis or has rapidly changing renal function. I should confirm that in advanced CKD or dialysis, the maximal recommended maintenance dose is often 62.5 mcg every other day or 62.5 mcg daily, with very close monitoring; in acute kidney injury or fluctuating GFR, digoxin levels can rise quickly, so I need to reassess dose and levels frequently and consider holding or reducing therapy if GFR drops substantially [^c532c2cc] [^69918142] [^a481efeb].

> Next, I should review outcomes data to balance benefit and risk. In HFrEF, digoxin reduces heart failure hospitalizations without affecting mortality, and this benefit appears consistent across renal strata in DIG analyses; however, observational AF data link digoxin use with higher mortality, likely confounded by indication and levels, so if used for AF rate control, I should keep levels low and reassess ongoing need regularly [^dbaae99b] [^2d65ecc5] [^0f52175c].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-mitigated plan. For a patient with eGFR 46 mL/min/1.73 m², I would start digoxin at 0.125 mg orally once daily if clinically indicated, but I should confirm there is a valid indication (e.g., persistent HFrEF symptoms despite GDMT or AF with rapid ventricular response where beta-blockers are insufficient), correct potassium and magnesium, review interacting drugs, and check a baseline digoxin level if available; if the patient is elderly, frail, or has low lean mass, I would favor 0.0625 mg daily and titrate cautiously, then recheck a trough level after 5–7 days and adjust to maintain 0.5–0.9 ng/mL, with earlier checks if symptoms or interacting drugs emerge [^d4752db1] [^ad63c4df] [^ad63c4df] [^4732360b].

> In conclusion, yes, digoxin can be used safely at an eGFR of 46 mL/min/1.73 m² if I dose reduce, monitor closely, and manage modifiable risks; the key is to use the lowest effective dose, anticipate prolonged time to steady state, and keep serum concentrations in the low therapeutic range with vigilant electrolyte and renal function monitoring, adjusting promptly if kidney function or clinical status changes [^c554c372] [^ad63c4df] [^ad63c4df].

---

Digoxin is **not absolutely contraindicated** at a GFR of 46 mL/min/1.73 m², but it requires **dose reduction and close monitoring** because renal impairment increases toxicity risk [^c554c372]. The recommended maintenance dose is **0.125 mg daily or every other day**, with serum digoxin levels checked every 3–5 days initially, then periodically, targeting 0.5–0.8 ng/mL [^ad63c4df]. Monitor for bradycardia, arrhythmias, and gastrointestinal or neurologic symptoms, and adjust the dose if toxicity occurs or if GFR declines further [^50eac19e].

---

## Pharmacokinetics of digoxin in renal impairment

Digoxin is **primarily eliminated unchanged by the kidneys**; as GFR declines, clearance falls and half-life extends, increasing accumulation and toxicity risk [^c554c372]. At GFR 46 mL/min/1.73 m², dose reduction is **essential** to avoid supratherapeutic levels [^d4752db1].

---

## Recommended dosing adjustments

Current guidance recommends the following adjustments for **eGFR 20–50 mL/min/1.73 m²**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended dose** |
|-|-|
| General recommendation | 0.125–0.25 mg daily (maximum) [^d4752db1] |
| Elderly or frail patients | 0.125 mg daily or every other day [^ad63c4df] |
| Loading dose (if needed) | 0.5–0.75 mg IV/PO in divided doses over 24 hours, with caution [^b76400fa] |

---

For a GFR of 46 mL/min/1.73 m², **0.125 mg daily or every other day** is appropriate, with further reduction if toxicity emerges or GFR worsens [^d4752db1].

---

## Monitoring and safety considerations

### Serum digoxin concentration monitoring

- **Initial monitoring**: Check levels every 3–5 days after initiation or dose changes until stable [^notfound].
- **Target range**: 0.5–0.8 ng/mL; toxicity risk rises above 1.2 ng/mL [^e6de3ba5].
- **Sampling**: Obtain trough levels just before the next dose [^4732360b].

---

### Clinical monitoring

Watch for **bradycardia, heart block, and arrhythmias** — especially with concomitant AV nodal blockers or electrolyte disturbances [^50eac19e]. Also monitor for gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, anorexia) and neurologic symptoms (confusion, visual disturbances) [^317e11bb].

---

### Laboratory monitoring

Check **serum potassium and magnesium** regularly, as hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia increase toxicity risk [^a481efeb]. Monitor **renal function** periodically, with closer surveillance if GFR declines [^1030d4cf].

---

## Clinical outcomes and risks

- **Benefit**: Digoxin can reduce HF hospitalizations in HFrEF, including patients with CKD, though mortality is unaffected [^dbaae99b] [^2d65ecc5].
- **Risk**: Higher toxicity rates occur in CKD, including arrhythmias and neurologic symptoms, especially without dose adjustment [^a481efeb].
- **Mortality**: Observational data link elevated digoxin levels to increased mortality, particularly in AF and CKD, underscoring the need for conservative dosing and monitoring [^0f52175c] [^0db96497].

---

## Alternative therapies

Consider **beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or antiarrhythmics** for rate control in AF or HF symptom management when appropriate [^e6de3ba5]. Use **ARNI/ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and MRAs** as foundational therapy in HFrEF, reserving digoxin for persistent symptoms or rate-control needs [^e6de3ba5].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Start low**: Begin at 0.125 mg daily or every other day, adjusting to clinical response and serum levels [^d4752db1].
- **Monitor closely**: Check digoxin levels, electrolytes, and renal function frequently, especially early in therapy or with changes in clinical status [^1030d4cf].
- **Adjust promptly**: Reduce dose or hold therapy if toxicity occurs or if GFR declines further [^c554c372].
- **Educate**: Ensure patients recognize toxicity symptoms and seek care promptly [^notfound].

---

Digoxin can be used safely at a GFR of 46 mL/min/1.73 m² with **dose reduction and vigilant monitoring**; keep levels low, watch for toxicity, and titrate cautiously to balance benefit and risk [^d4752db1] [^e6de3ba5].

Renal dysfunction is a common complication for patients with heart failure, but its association with clinical outcomes has not been fully characterized. We evaluated the association of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) with heart failure survival and the effect of digoxin on heart failure outcomes across GFR strata. A secondary analysis from the Digitalis Intervention Group trial was conducted of 6800 outpatients with systolic heart failure. Renal function was categorized as estimated GFR (expressed in ml/min per 1.73 m²). All-cause mortality (mean, 3 yr) was inversely proportional to GFR (GFR > 60, 31% mortality; GFR 30 to 60, 46% mortality; GFR < 30, 62% mortality; P < 0.001). Among patients with a GFR < 50, lower GFR were associated with greater adjusted mortality risk (GFR < 30: hazard ratio [HR], 2.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.69 to 2.51; GFR 30 to 40: HR, 1.42, 95% CI, 1.22 to 1.67; GFR 40 to 50: HR, 1.22, 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.39; GFR 50 to 60: HR, 1.00, referent). In contrast, participants with GFR 60 to 70 had similar risk (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.14) compared with GFR 50 to 60, and those with GFR > 70 had a slightly lower mortality hazard (0.89; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.00). Linear spline analyses confirmed that GFR = 50 was the appropriate risk threshold; above 50, GFR had no association with mortality, whereas below 50, mortality risk increased sharply with declining GFR (spline coefficient, P < 0.0001). Digoxin efficacy did not differ by level of GFR (P = 0.19 for interaction). Renal dysfunction is strongly associated with mortality in stable outpatients with heart failure, notably in patients with estimated GFR < 50 ml/min per 1.73 m². The effect of digoxin did not differ by level of renal function.

Recommendations for use of cardiac glycosides in clinical practice

Cardiac glycosides should only be used with proper clinical indications according to best evidence recommended by current guidelines (ESC) as well as very recently reviewed for the increasing number of patients suffering from HF and/or AF: –

Cardiac glycosides still may be considered in symptomatic HF patients (NYHA II–IV) in sinus rhythm despite treatment with ACE inhibitor (or angiotensin receptor blocker), beta-blocker, and a mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonist to reduce risk of hospitalization (ESC HF guidelines, class IIb recommendation). Cardiac glycosides are recommended (with/without beta-blocker) for rate control of AF in HF patients with an ejection fraction ≤ 40% (ESC AF guidelines, class I recommendation). For patient safety, target serum concentrations should be 0.5–0.9 ng/mL for digoxin and 8–18 ng/mL for digitoxin, which is in the lower part of the so called 'therapeutic' range (Figure 3). Furthermore, target serum concentrations should be controlled, especially for digoxin in chronic kidney disease due to its predominant renal excretion, whereas excretion of digitoxin is still sufficient even in advanced chronic kidney disease due to its pronounced entero-hepatic recycling.

Figure 3
Recommendations for the use of cardiac glycosides in clinical practice for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and/or atrial fibrillation (AF). Therapy with cardiac glycosides should be preferred in certain populations and target serum concentrations for digoxin and digitoxin should be in the lower part of the so called 'therapeutic' range as described. *Lower daily doses of digitoxin are recommended by the authors to achieve target serum concentrations of 8–18 ng/mL digitoxin. This differs from the recommended daily dose of 0.05–0.3 mg digitoxin for rate control in ESC guidelines for management of AF, which do not recommend certain target serum concentrations for digitoxin.

### Digoxin use and outcomes in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^6aa8f499]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Heart failure is a leading cause for hospital readmission. Digoxin use may lower this risk in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), but data on contemporary patients receiving other evidence-based therapies are lacking.

Methods

Of the 11,900 patients with HFrEF (ejection fraction ≤ 45%) in Medicare-linked OPTIMIZE-HF, 8401 were not on digoxin, of whom 1571 received discharge prescriptions for digoxin. We matched 1531 of these patients with 1531 not receiving digoxin by propensity scores for digoxin use. The matched cohort (n = 3062; mean age, 76 years; 44% women; 14% African American) was balanced on 52 baseline characteristics. We assembled a second matched cohort of 2850 patients after excluding those with estimated glomerular filtration rate < 15 mL/min/1.73 m² and heart rate < 60 beats/min. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for digoxin-associated outcomes were estimated in the matched cohorts.

Results

Among the 3062 matched patients, digoxin use was associated with a significantly lower risk of heart failure readmission at 30 days (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.59–0.93), 1 year (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.72–0.92), and 6 years (HR, 0.90; 95% CI 0.81–0.99). The association with all-cause readmission was significant at 1 and 6 years but not 30 days. There was no association with mortality. Similar associations were observed among the 2850 matched patients without bradycardia or renal insufficiency.

Conclusions

Among hospitalized older patients with HFrEF receiving contemporary treatments for heart failure, digoxin use is associated with a lower risk of hospital readmission but not all-cause mortality.

### American Geriatrics Society 2023 updated AGS beers criteria® for potentially inappropriate medication use in older adults [^24cbcc37]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2023). High credibility.

Cardiovascular — Digoxin — if used for atrial fibrillation or heart failure, avoid doses > 0.125 mg/day. Decreased renal clearance of digoxin may lead to increased risk of toxicity; lower dosages used for rate control of atrial fibrillation may be necessary with stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease.

### Potential effects of digoxin on long-term renal and clinical outcomes in chronic heart failure [^b39c8957]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Digitalis glycosides are known to improve the hemodynamic and neurohormonal perturbations that contribute to heart failure (HF)-induced renal dysfunction (RD). The objective of this study was to determine if randomization to digoxin is associated with improvement in renal function (IRF) and to evaluate if patients with digoxin-induced IRF have improved clinical outcomes.

Methods and Results

Patients in the Digitalis Investigation Group (DIG) dataset with protocol-driven 1-year serum creatinine levels (performed in a central laboratory; n = 980) were studied. IRF was defined as a postrandomization ≥ 20% increase in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). IRF occurred in 15.5% of the population (mean improvement in eGFR 34.5 ± 15.4%) and was more common in patients randomized to digoxin (adjusted odds ratio 1.6; P = 0.02). In patients without IRF, digoxin was not associated with reduced death or hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.96, 95% CI 0.8–1.2; P = 0.67). However, in the group with IRF, digoxin was associated with substantially improved hospitalization-free survival (adjusted HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.3–0.8; P = 0.006; P interaction = .026).

Conclusions

In this subset of the DIG trial, digoxin was associated with long-term improvement in kidney function and, in patients demonstrating this favorable renal response, reduction in death or hospitalization. Additional research is necessary to confirm these hypothesis-generating findings.

PRECAUTIONS

Use in Patients with Impaired Renal Function: Digoxin is primarily excreted by the kidneys; therefore, patients with impaired renal function require smaller than usual maintenance doses of digoxin (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Because of the prolonged elimination half-life, a longer period of time is required to achieve an initial or new steady-state serum concentration in patients with renal impairment than in patients with normal renal function. If appropriate care is not taken to reduce the dose of digoxin, such patients are at high risk for toxicity, and toxic effects will last longer in such patients than in patients with normal renal function.

Use in Patients with Electrolyte Disorders: In patients with hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, toxicity may occur despite serum digoxin concentrations below 2.0 ng/mL, because potassium or magnesium depletion sensitizes the myocardium to digoxin. Therefore, it is desirable to maintain normal serum potassium and magnesium concentrations in patients being treated with digoxin. Deficiencies of these electrolytes may result from malnutrition, diarrhea, or prolonged vomiting, as well as the use of the following drugs or procedures: diuretics, amphotericin B, corticosteroids, antacids, dialysis, and mechanical suction of gastrointestinal secretions.

Hypercalcemia from any cause predisposes the patient to digitalis toxicity. Calcium, particularly when administered rapidly by the intravenous route, may produce serious arrhythmias in digitalized patients. On the other hand, hypocalcemia can nullify the effects of digoxin in humans; thus, digoxin may be ineffective until serum calcium is restored to normal. These interactions are related to the fact that digoxin affects contractility and excitability of the heart in a manner similar to that of calcium.

### 2011 ACCF / AHA / HRS focused update on the management of patients with atrial fibrillation (updating the 2006 guideline): a report of the American college of cardiology foundation / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines [^dc6c68c6]. Circulation (2011). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — dronedarone safety, interactions, and dosing are detailed as follows: In patients with recently decompensated heart failure and depressed LV function, dronedarone increased mortality after a median follow-up of only 2 months; 8.1% in the dronedarone group died and 3.8% in the placebo group died (HR 2.13; 95% CI, 1.07 to 4.25; P = 0.03). Therefore, dronedarone should not be administered to patients with depressed ventricular function and recent heart failure decompensation or NYHA class IV heart failure. The major adverse cardiac effects are bradycardia and QT prolongation, and torsades de pointes has been reported. Dronedarone inhibits renal tubular secretion of creatinine without reducing glomerular filtration rate and increases digoxin levels 1.7- to 2.5-fold. It is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 with a half-life of approximately 19 hours; it should not be administered with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 but can be administered with verapamil or diltiazem using low initial doses titrated to response and tolerance. Dronedarone does not alter the international normalization ratio when used with warfarin. The recommended oral dose is 400 mg twice a day with meals, and an intravenous form is not available.

### The assessment of renal function in relation to the use of drugs in elderly in nursing homes; a cohort study [^4505ca8f]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are used for the treatment of congestive heart failure, hypertension, for secondary prevention after myocardial infarction and for slowing the progression of renal disease. Hyperkalemia does not usually occur in renocompetent patients, but can be common in patients with renal impairment, diabetes and those taking medications which interfere with renal potassium secretion. Therefore potassium levels should be monitored carefully in patients at risk. There is no specific creatinine level that is an absolute contraindication to ACEI therapy. However, it is recommended to titrate the dosage slowly when initiating treatment and the target dosage may have to be reduced. An initial increase of 20 percent in the serum creatinine levels is common, but it is not an indication for discontinuing the medication. The same cautions apply when prescribing angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) as ACEI.

Digoxin is used as symptomatic treatment in subjects with heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Morbidity associated with the use of digoxin is common due to its narrow therapeutic index. The toxicity of digoxin is dose dependent and is often the result of alterations in renal function. In patients with renal impairment, digoxin therapy is associated with an increase in the risk of cardiac dysrhythmias. For this reason it is recommended to reduce the dose in these patients and the serum concentration must be monitored carefully.

There is not much research on the population of frail elderly in nursing homes, although these patients often have both many medications and reduced renal function. The aim of this study was to explore the renal function in elderly subjects in nursing homes by using different GFR estimates and to investigate the association between the estimates. We also (and firstly) wanted to assess the use of pharmaceuticals that may be harmful to patients with renal impairment. Did the clinicians take notice of the impaired renal function before prescription?

### Therapies for acute heart failure in patients with reduced kidney function: a community-based perspective [^46ee65da]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Limited data exist describing the management of patients with decreased kidney function at the time of hospital presentation for acute heart failure (HF).

Study Design

Nonconcurrent prospective study.

Setting & Participants

Patients hospitalized with clinical findings of decompensated HF (n = 4,350) at all 11 greater Worcester, MA, medical centers in 1995 and 2000. Patients were categorized into varying levels of kidney function based on their estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).

Predictor

GFR estimates from serum creatinine levels measured at the time of hospital admission.

Outcomes

Hospital receipt of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers, digoxin, and diuretics.

Measurements

Hospital charts were reviewed for prescribing of disease-modifying cardiac therapies, as well as therapies designed to provide symptomatic relief from HF.

Results

Average eGFR in our study sample was 64.4 ± 33.1 mL/min/1.73 m², and patients were categorized further into 3 eGFR levels of less than 30 (n = 569), 30 to 59 (n = 1,488), and 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or greater (n = 2,293) for comparative purposes. Patients with greater eGFRs (≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m²) were more likely to be treated with ACE inhibitors/ARBs (56% versus 39%) and digoxin (51% versus 46%) during hospitalization for HF than patients with lower eGFRs (< 30 mL/min/1.73 m²; P < 0.05). Patients with lower eGFRs (< 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) were more likely to be prescribed beta-blockers than patients with greater eGFRs (≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m²; 46% versus 39%; P < 0.01). Use of ACE inhibitors/ARBs increased between 1995 and 2000 in 2 of the 3 eGFR groups examined: eGFRs less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² (33% in 1995; 42% in 2000) and eGFRs of 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or greater (51% in 1995; 59% in 2000). Use of beta-blockers increased appreciably in all 3 eGFR groups (< 30 mL/min/1.73 m², 27% in 1995; 58% in 2000; ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m²: 25% in 1995; 49% in 2000). However, less than one third of all patients were treated with both disease-modifying therapies in 2000.

Limitations

We were unable to classify patients into those with systolic versus diastolic HF.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that use of disease-modifying therapies for patients hospitalized with clinical findings of acute HF and decreased kidney function remains less than desirable. Educational programs are needed to enhance the management of patients with decreased kidney function who develop HF.

Introduction

Digoxin is used in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) who remain symptomatic despite optimal medical treatment. Impaired renal function is commonly associated with CHF. We investigated the relation between digoxin use and change in renal function over time in patients with CHF.

Methods

One thousand two hundred forty-one patients with symptoms and signs of CHF (average age 72 years (64% male), and median NTproBNP 1426 ng/l (interquartile range 632–2897) were divided into four groups: never on digoxin (N = 394); digoxin throughout (N = 449); started digoxin at some point after baseline (N = 367); and stopped digoxin at some point after baseline (N = 31). The rate of change of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using linear regression.

Results

Patients on digoxin throughout had a significantly greater rate of decline in eGFR per year than patients not on digoxin throughout (mean (± standard deviation); − 5 (14) ml/min/1.73 m² per year v − 2 (11) ml/min/1.73 m² per year, P = 0.02). In those patients who started digoxin during follow up, there was no significant difference in the rate of decline in eGFR before and after starting digoxin. There was no correlation between baseline eGFR (or rate of decline in eGFR) and age, haemoglobin or NTproBNP. Compared to patients taking both angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and beta-blocker (BB), patients who were not taking an ACEi/ARB or BB had a numerically faster rate of decline in eGFR, although this was not statistically significant.

Conclusion

The rate of decline in renal function is greater in patients with CHF who are taking digoxin.

### Medications used routinely in primary care to be dose-adjusted or avoided in people with chronic kidney disease: results of a modified Delphi study [^fe982302]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects up to 18% of those over the age of 65 years. Potentially inappropriate medication prescribing in people with CKD is common. Objectives: Develop a pragmatic list of medications used in primary care that required dose adjustment or avoidance in people with CKD, using a modified Delphi panel approach, followed by a consensus workshop. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive literature search to identify potential medications. A group of 17 experts participated in a 3-round modified Delphi panel to identify medications for inclusion. A subsequent consensus workshop of 8 experts reviewed this list to prioritize medications for the development of point-of-care knowledge translation materials for primary care. Results: After a comprehensive literature review, 59 medications were included for consideration by the Delphi panel, with a further 10 medications added after the initial round. On completion of the 3 Delphi rounds, 66 unique medications remained, 63 requiring dose adjustment and 16 medications requiring avoidance in one or more estimated glomerular filtration rate categories. The consensus workshop prioritized this list further to 24 medications that must be dose-adjusted or avoided, including baclofen, metformin, and digoxin, as well as the newer SGLT2 inhibitor agents. Conclusion and Relevance: We have developed a concise list of 24 medications commonly used in primary care that should be dose-adjusted or avoided in people with CKD to reduce harm. This list incorporates new and frequently prescribed medications and will inform an updated, easy to access source for primary care providers.

### The effect of digoxin on renal function in patients with heart failure [^a708b18f]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our findings do not support the hypothesis that digoxin might have a protective effect against progressive renal dysfunction in patients with heart failure. We found that renal function declined with time in the whole cohort but that the rate of decline was significantly faster in patients who were already taking digoxin at baseline. Renal function declines with age, and more rapidly in patients with heart failure. Treatment of heart failure with ACEi and MRAs almost inevitably lead to a degree renal dysfunction, in part due to haemodynamic changes.

Digoxin has been used in patients with heart failure for over 200 years, but there is no clear evidence of a benefit on mortality. In the DIG trial, conducted in patients with heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction who were in sinus rhythm, digoxin reduced hospitalizations due to heart failure by 7.9% but had no significant effect on all-cause mortality.3 In a subgroup analysis, patients with more severe symptoms and signs (NYHA class III/IV or left ventricular ejection fraction less than 25% or who had a cardiothoracic ratio more than 55%) digoxin use was associated with a reduction in 2 year heart failure mortality and hospitalization.3 In contrast, meta-analyses by Vamos and colleagues and Bavishi and colleagues suggested that digoxin was associated with an increase in mortality both in patients with HF and in patients with AF by 21 and 15%, respectively: however, these meta-analyses were conducted on observational and registry studies. Digoxin had no effect on mortality in a meta-analysis of 7 randomised control trials with a control arm in both patients with HF and those with AF. As a consequence of the lack in mortality benefit, digoxin tends to be reserved particularly for those who remain symptomatic despite first line treatment with ACEi, BB and MRA.2.

8.6 Renal Impairment

The clearance of digoxin can be primarily correlated with the renal function as indicated by creatinine clearance. Tables 3 and 5 provide the usual daily maintenance dose requirements for digoxin based on creatinine clearance [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Digoxin is primarily excreted by the kidneys; therefore, patients with impaired renal function require smaller than usual maintenance doses of digoxin [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Because of the prolonged elimination half-life, a longer period of time is required to achieve an initial or new steady-state serum concentration in patients with renal impairment than in patients with normal renal function. If appropriate care is not taken to reduce the dose of digoxin, such patients are at high risk for toxicity, and toxic effects will last longer in such patients than in patients with normal renal function.

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

Plasma digoxin concentrations in patients with acute hepatitis generally fall within the range of profiles in a group of healthy subjects.

8.8 Malabsorption

The absorption of digoxin is reduced in some malabsorption conditions such as chronic diarrhea.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

General: Recommended dosages of digoxin may require considerable modification because of individual sensitivity of the patient to the drug, the presence of associated conditions, or the use of concurrent medications. In selecting a dose of digoxin, the following factors must be considered:

The body weight of the patient. Doses should be calculated based upon lean (i.e., ideal) body weight.
The patient's renal function, preferably evaluated on the basis of estimated creatinine clearance.
The patient's age. Infants and children require different doses of digoxin than adults. Also, advanced age may be indicative of diminished renal function even in patients with normal serum creatinine concentration (i.e., below 1.5 mg/dL).
Concomitant disease states, concurrent medications, or other factors likely to alter the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profile of digoxin (see PRECAUTIONS).

Serum Digoxin Concentrations: In general, the dose of digoxin used should be determined on clinical grounds. However, measurement of serum digoxin concentrations can be helpful to the clinician in determining the adequacy of digoxin therapy and in assigning certain probabilities to the likelihood of digoxin intoxication. About two-thirds of adults considered adequately digitalized (without evidence of toxicity) have serum digoxin concentrations ranging from 0.8 to 2.0 ng/mL. However, digoxin may produce clinical benefits even at serum concentrations below this range. About two-thirds of adult patients with clinical toxicity have serum digoxin concentrations greater than 2.0 ng/mL. However, since one-third of patients with clinical toxicity have concentrations less than 2.0 ng/mL, values below 2.0 ng/mL do not rule out the possibility that a certain sign or symptom is related to digoxin therapy. Rarely, there are patients who are unable to tolerate digoxin at serum concentrations below 0.8 ng/mL. Consequently, the serum concentration of digoxin should always be interpreted in the overall clinical context, and an isolated measurement should not be used alone as the basis for increasing or decreasing the dose of the drug.

Adherence to treatment

Patients with CKD were more likely to have low adherence (i.e. PDC < 80%) to guideline‐recommended therapies. For ACEi/ARB/ARNi, 85%, 87%, 89%, and 91% of patients showed low adherence for eGFR ≥ 60, 45–59, 30–44, and < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2, respectively (Figure 3). For beta‐blockers this was 46%, 52%, 55%, and 56%; for MRAs 47%, 53%, 61%, and 59%; and for triple therapy 94%, 95%, 97%, and 97%. These differences remained after multivariable analysis for ACEi/ARB/ARNi and MRAs, while no differences were observed for beta‐blockers, and confidence intervals were broad for triple therapy (Figure 3A). Results were similar for patients with HFmrEF (online supplementary Figure S4A).

### Digoxin (digox) [^b76400fa]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

A single initial dose of 500 to 750 mcg (0.5 to 0.75 mg) of digoxin tablets usually produces a detectable effect in 0.5 to 2 hours that becomes maximal in 2 to 6 hours. Additional doses of 125 to 375 mcg (0.125 to 0.375 mg) may be given cautiously at 6 to 8-hour intervals until clinical evidence of an adequate effect is noted. The usual amount of digoxin tablets that a 70 kg patient requires to achieve 8 to 12 mcg/kg peak body stores is 750 to 1250 mcg (0.75 to 1.25 mg).

Digoxin Injection is frequently used to achieve rapid digitalization, with conversion to digoxin tablets or digoxin solution in capsules for maintenance therapy. If patients are switched from intravenous to oral digoxin formulations, allowances must be made for differences in bioavailability when calculating maintenance dosages (see Table 1, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

Maintenance Dosing: The doses of digoxin used in controlled trials in patients with heart failure have ranged from 125 to 500 mcg (0.125 to 0.5 mg) once daily. In these studies, the digoxin dose has been generally titrated according to the patient's age, lean body weight, and renal function. Therapy is generally initiated at a dose of 250 mcg (0.25 mg) once daily in patients under age 70 with good renal function, at a dose of 125 mcg (0.125 mg) once daily in patients over age 70 or with impaired renal function, and at a dose of 62.5 mcg (0.0625 mg) in patients with marked renal impairment. Doses may be increased every 2 weeks according to clinical response.

### Impact of substantial weight loss on digoxin intoxication during long-term therapy [^76f8e150]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite numerous safety studies on digoxin, the association of substantial body weight loss with the development of digoxin intoxication and the transition of risk factors over time in patients on long-term digoxin treatment remain unclear.

Objective

This study aimed to reveal whether the risk factors of digoxin intoxication, including substantial body weight loss, change over the course of treatment.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted in adult patients newly prescribed digoxin between January 2010 and December 2021. Multiple logistic analysis was performed to identify clinical features associated with digoxin intoxication over time.

Results

A total of 329 patients followed for a median period of 139 (interquartile range, 29–909) days were selected for analysis. Among them, 36 patients (11%) developed digoxin intoxication. Multivariate analysis identified concomitant diuretics (odds ratio, 36.64; 95% confidence interval, 5.77–232.56), comorbid cancer (8.76; 1.95–39.31), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reduction ≥ 30% from baseline (9.01; 2.31–35.16), and hemodialysis (47.30; 5.77–387.49) as risk factors associated with digoxin intoxication occurring within 6 months of digoxin treatment; while weight loss > 6% during the last 6–12 months (16.07; 2.99–86.48), and eGFR reduction ≥ 30% from baseline (11.55; 2.37–56.35) were risk factors of intoxication occurring after 6 months of treatment.

Conclusion and Relevance

Concomitant diuretics and comorbid cancer were risk factors of digoxin intoxication during early treatment, whereas substantial body weight loss ≥ 6% became the risk factor after prolonged treatment, and impaired renal function was the risk factor spanning early to prolonged treatment. Thus, transition of risk factors of digoxin intoxication during prolonged course of treatment was observed.

### Digitalis toxicity: a fading but crucial complication to recognize [^f1fd6774]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Digoxin usage has decreased in the treatment of congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation as a result of its inferiority to beta-adrenergic inhibitors and agents that interfere with the deleterious effects of the activated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. As a result of reduction of usage and dosage, glycoside toxicity has become an uncommon occurrence but may be overlooked when it does occur. Older age, female sex, low lean body mass, and renal insufficiency contribute to higher serum levels and enhanced risk for toxicity. Arrhythmias suggesting digoxin toxicity led to its recognition in the case presented here.

### Determining the risk of elevated digoxin concentrations following loading dose in patients with acute and chronic kidney disease [^00fcb453]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal loading dose of digoxin in patients with reduced kidney function is unknown. Tertiary references recommend reduced loading doses; however, these recommendations are based on immunoassays that are falsely elevated by the presence of digoxin-like immunoreactive substances, a problem that is minimized in modern assays.

Objective

To determine whether chronic kidney disease (CKD) or acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with supratherapeutic digoxin concentrations after a digoxin loading dose.

Methods

A retrospective analysis on patients who received an intravenous loading dose of digoxin with a digoxin concentration collected 6 to 24 hours after the end of the dose. Patients were stratified into 3 groups: AKI, CKD, and non-AKI/CKD (NKI) based on glomerular filtration rate and serum creatinine. The primary outcome was frequency of supratherapeutic digoxin concentrations (> 2 ng/mL) and secondary outcomes included frequency of adverse events.

Results

A total of 146 digoxin concentrations were included (AKI = 59, CKD = 16, NKI = 71). Frequencies of supratherapeutic concentrations were similar between groups (AKI: 10.2%, CKD: 18.8%, NKI: 11.3%; P = 0.61). Pre-planned logistic regression demonstrated no significant relationship between kidney function group and the development of a supratherapeutic concentration (AKI: odds ratio [OR]: 1.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.4–4.5; CKD: OR 4.3, 95% CI: 0.7–23).

Conclusion and Relevance

This is the first study in routine clinical practice evaluating the relationship between kidney function and digoxin peak concentrations that differentiates AKI from CKD. We did not find a relationship between kidney function and peak concentrations; however, the group with CKD was underpowered.

### The assessment of renal function in relation to the use of drugs in elderly in nursing homes; a cohort study [^ca356705]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

In this study population, the investigated renal risk drugs were rather rarely prescribed, especially metformin (4 patients) and NSAID (4 patients). This may indicate awareness among the prescribers of renal impairment in the elderly population and the accompanied risk when prescribing medications. The awareness of this risk of metformin appears higher than previously reported. In an out-patient clinic in Palestine 60% of the patients treated with metformin had at least one contraindication and a Thai study showed that over 80% of patients with type 2 diabetes with contraindication for metformin were using this medication.

The exception in our study is ACE-inhibitors/ARB, which were prescribed to 40 patients. These medications however, are also renoprotective and should thus be considered for this group of patients. Many of the subjects using ACE-inhibitors/ARB had reduced GFR (65% when cystatin C-estimated). This may represent an intentional use for these patients as renoprotection. However, one has to be observant and the potassium levels should be strictly monitored. The use of diuretics was frequent, 100 patients, and this may of course also affect potassium levels.

Almost half of the subjects taking digoxin had reduced GFR (< 60 ml/min). This may be risky, due to the narrow therapeutic index of digoxin. There is an obvious risk that GFR is gradually decreasing even more, with the subsequent accumulation and adverse reactions. Sweileh et al found that digoxin was one of the most commonly prescribed inappropriate medications in patients with renal insufficiency. Accordingly, digoxin is one of the medications frequently seen in patients admitted to hospital due to adverse reactions. Probably the prescribers of the patients in our study had only observed s-creatinine before initiating the digoxin therapy, since almost half of the subjects with renal impairment had normal levels of s-creatinine. It is however not surprising that 19 patients were prescribed digoxin, since as many as 40 patients had chronic atrial fibrillation.

2.1 Important Dosing and Administration Information

In selecting a digoxin tablets dosing regimen, it is important to consider factors that affect digoxin blood levels (e.g., body weight, age, renal function, concomitant drugs) since toxic levels of digoxin are only slightly higher than therapeutic levels. Dosing can be either initiated with a loading dose followed by maintenance dosing if rapid titration is desired or initiated with maintenance dosing without a loading dose.

Consider interruption or reduction in digoxin tablets dose prior to electrical cardioversion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Use digoxin solution to obtain the appropriate dose in infants, young pediatric patients, or patients with very low body weight.

2.2 Loading Dosing Regimen in Adults and Pediatric Patients

For adults and pediatric patients if a loading dosage is to be given, administer half the total loading dose initially, then ¼ the loading dose every 6 to 8 hours twice, with careful assessment of clinical response and toxicity before each dose. The recommended loading dose is displayed in Table 1.

2.3 Maintenance Dosing in Adults and Pediatric Patients Over 10 Years Old

The maintenance dose is based on lean body weight, renal function, age, and concomitant products [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

The recommended starting maintenance dose in adults and pediatric patients over 10 years old with normal renal function is given in Table 2. Doses may be increased every 2 weeks according to clinical response, serum drug levels, and toxicity.

Table 3 provides the recommended (once daily) maintenance dose for adults and pediatric patients over 10 years old (to be given once daily) according to lean body weight and renal function. The doses are based on studies in adult patients with heart failure. Alternatively, the maintenance dose may be estimated by the following formula (peak body stores lost each day through elimination):

Total Maintenance Dose = Loading Dose (i.e. Peak Body Stores) × % Daily Loss/100 (% Daily Loss = 14 + Creatinine clearance/5)

Reduce the dose of digoxin tablets in patients whose lean weight is an abnormally small fraction of their total body mass because of obesity or edema.

### Digoxin (digox) [^4c8dff56]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

In a subset of approximately 1800 patients enrolled in the DIG trial (wherein dosing was based on an algorithm similar to that in Table 5) the mean (± SD) serum digoxin concentrations at 1 month and 12 months were 1.01 ± 0.47 ng/mL and 0.97 ± 0.43 ng/mL, respectively.

The maintenance dose should be based upon the percentage of the peak body stores lost each day through elimination. The following formula has had wide clinical use:

(Ccr is creatinine clearance, corrected to 70 kg body weight or 1.73 m² body surface area.)

Table 5 provides average daily maintenance dose requirements of digoxin tablets for patients with heart failure based upon lean body weight and renal function:

Example: Based on Table 5, a patient in heart failure with an estimated lean body weight of 70 kg and a Ccr of 60 mL/min should be given a dose of 250 mcg (0.25 mg) daily of digoxin tablets, usually taken after the morning meal. If no loading dose is administered, steady-state serum concentrations in this patient should be anticipated at approximately 11 days.

Infants and Children: In general, divided daily dosing is recommended for infants and young children (under age 10). In the newborn period, renal clearance of digoxin is diminished and suitable dosage adjustments must be observed. This is especially pronounced in the premature infant. Beyond the immediate newborn period, children generally require proportionally larger doses than adults on the basis of body weight or body surface area. Children over 10 years of age require adult dosages in proportion to their body weight. Some researchers have suggested that infants and young children tolerate slightly higher serum concentrations than do adults.

8.6 Renal Impairment

The clearance of digoxin can be primarily correlated with the renal function as indicated by creatinine clearance. Table 3 and Table 5 provide the usual daily maintenance dose requirements for digoxin based on creatinine clearance [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Digoxin is primarily excreted by the kidneys; therefore, patients with impaired renal function require smaller than usual maintenance doses of digoxin [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Because of the prolonged elimination half-life, a longer period of time is required to achieve an initial or new steady-state serum concentration in patients with renal impairment than in patients with normal renal function. If appropriate care is not taken to reduce the dose of digoxin, such patients are at high risk for toxicity, and toxic effects will last longer in such patients than in patients with normal renal function.

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

Plasma digoxin concentrations in patients with acute hepatitis generally fall within the range of profiles in a group of healthy subjects.

8.8 Malabsorption

The absorption of digoxin is reduced in some malabsorption conditions such as chronic diarrhea.

### Digoxin use and subsequent clinical outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation with or without heart failure in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial [^0f52175c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

SCD is the single most common cause of death among patients with AF, accounting for about a third of all deaths. 23, 24, 25, 26 In a recent analysis from the ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48 trial, the cause for SCD was unknown in most cases and an arrhythmia was documented in only a minority of SCD events (11.5%). 25 Digoxin is an important factor associated with SCD in this population. 25 The association between digoxin use and SCD in patients with AF appears to be more dominant in individuals without HF, yet the causality is not clear and seems complex. Digoxin has a narrow therapeutic range and is influenced by drug‐to‐drug interactions, serum electrolyte concentrations, and renal function. 3 In patients with AF, the majority of whom are elderly with concomitant medically treated conditions, digoxin concentration may fluctuate. In this study, patients without HF who were treated with digoxin were elderly (more than half were ≥ 75 years) with a high burden of comorbidities including diabetes mellitus and reduced renal function. These characteristics may have predisposed them to abnormal digoxin concentration, yet our results did not show any heterogeneity for the risk of SCD by any of these factors, perhaps owing to low statistical power. Whether the concomitant use of β‐blockers with digoxin in patients without HF has a protective effect against SCD is not known and it cannot be established from this observational study. In addition, whether digoxin's inotropic activity in patients without HF can be harmful deserves further research. Thus, revealing additional mechanisms of the association between digoxin use and SCD in patients with AF without HF is of interest.

### Digoxin initiation and outcomes in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^e14be1a0]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Digoxin reduces the risk of heart failure hospitalization in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Less is known about this association in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), the examination of which was the objective of the current study.

Methods

In the Medicare-linked OPTIMIZE-HF registry, 7374 patients hospitalized for HF had ejection fraction ≥ 50% and were not receiving digoxin prior to admission. Of these, 5675 had a heart rate ≥ 50 beats per minute, an estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or did not receive inpatient dialysis, and digoxin was initiated in 524 of these patients. Using propensity scores for digoxin initiation, calculated for each of the 5675 patients, we assembled a matched cohort of 513 pairs of patients initiated and not initiated on digoxin, balanced on 58 baseline characteristics (mean age, 80 years; 66% women; 8% African American). Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for outcomes associated with digoxin initiation were estimated in the matched cohort.

Results

Among the 1026 matched patients with HFpEF, 30-day heart failure readmission occurred in 6% and 9% of patients initiated and not initiated on digoxin, respectively (HR 0.70; 95% CI, 0.45–1.10; P = 0.124). HRs (95% CIs) for 30-day all-cause readmission and all-cause mortality associated with digoxin initiation were 0.95 (0.73–1.23; P = 0.689) and 0.93 (0.55–1.56; P = 0.773), respectively. Digoxin initiation had no association with 6-year outcomes.

Conclusion

Digoxin initiation prior to hospital discharge was not associated with 30-day or 6-year outcomes in older hospitalized patients with HFpEF.

### The effect of digoxin on renal function in patients with heart failure [^d01827e6]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Each patient's 6 monthly renal function was obtained retrospectively. For the 2 groups with no change in digoxin use, renal function was recorded over 18 months. For the other 2 groups, renal function was obtained 6 and 12 months before starting/stopping of digoxin, at the date of starting/stopping digoxin and 6, 12 and 18 months after starting/stopping digoxin.

The eGFR derived from serum creatinine was calculated using the following equation recommended by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and validated by the local biochemistry laboratory: eGFR ml/min/1.73 m² = 141 × min(S_cr/κ, 1)ᵅ × max(S_cr/κ, 1)⁻¹.²⁰⁹ × 0.993ᴬᵍᵉ × 1.018 [if female] × 1.159 [if black] (where S_cr = serum creatinine in μmol/L, κ is 61.9 for females and 79.6 for males, α is − 0.329 for females and − 0.411 for males, min indicates the minimum of S_cr/κ or 1, and max indicates the maximum of S_cr/κ or 1).

Change in renal function was calculated as a linear regression using the 6 monthly eGFR from baseline to 12 months. At least 3 values were used to produce a linear regression line. For the patients with heart failure who started/ stopped digoxin after baseline, the rate of change in renal function before and after the change in digoxin use was calculated.

The research conforms to the Helsinki declaration and ethics approval was given by the Hull and East Riding Local Research Ethics Committee for the use of the patient records. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects or if subjects are under 18, from a parent and/or legal guardian.at the point of first diagnosis of heart failure to use their medical record for research purposes.

### Digoxin use and subsequent clinical outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation with or without heart failure in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial [^6ddb067f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

This study represents an analysis from the ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48 (Effective Anticoagulation With Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation‐Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 48) trial. The ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48 trial was a 3‐group, randomized, double‐blind, double‐dummy multinational trial that compared 2 dosing regimens of the oral factor Xa inhibitor edoxaban with warfarin in 21 105 patients with AF (NCT00781391). 17 A detailed description of the study population, study design, and results of the trial have been published. 17, 18 In brief, eligible patients were 21 years and older with ECG evidence of AF within 12 months before randomization and had a CHADS 2 score ≥ 2 and planned anticoagulation. Key exclusion criteria were AF attributable to a reversible cause, presence of a mechanical valve or moderate‐severe mitral stenosis, increased risk of bleeding, recent acute coronary syndrome or stroke within 30 days before randomization, severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min), and life expectancy < 12 months. Patients with any class of HF could be enrolled provided they were clinically stable at the time of randomization. The protocol and amendments were approved by the ethics committee at each participating center. All patients provided written informed consent.

Digoxin Use and HF Definition

Digoxin use was captured by the treating physician in the concomitant medication case report form at baseline before enrollment. HF was defined as the presence or history of clinical stage C or D HF according to the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association criteria. 19 This includes structural heart disease with prior or current symptoms of HF, such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and decreased exercise tolerance (stage C), or refractory HF requiring specialized interventions (stage D). Investigators classified HF at baseline as "systolic", "diastolic", or "both", provided the New York Heart Association functional class, and when available, reported the most recent LVEF before randomization.

### The effect of digoxin on renal function in patients with heart failure [^51475d8d]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

The effect of worsening renal function on digoxin toxicity is well known. In end-stage renal disease, the fluctuating concentration of potassium during dialysis may increase the risk of digoxin toxicity. In patients with end stage renal failure, mortality increases with increasing serum digoxin levels. The sodium/potassium ATPase pump normally causes sodium to leave cells and potassium to enter cells, blocking this mechanism using digoxin results in higher serum potassium levels. In a study by Edner and colleagues of 10 healthy subjects, compared to no digitaliation, patients given 0.37–0.50 mg of digoxin daily for 10 days had an increase in serum potassium by 0.19 ± 0.23 mmol/l (p < 0.05) When renal potassium excretion is reduced due to reduction in kidney function, even slow-acting glyeosides should provoke hyperkalemia.

Whether digoxin affects renal function is not fully understood. We found that patients on digoxin had a significantly faster rate of decline in eGFR. However, in subgroup analysis of patients in the DIG trial who had their creatinine measured at 1 year, renal function improved more in patients in the digoxin group than in those taking placebo. Mortality in DIG did not vary with the use of digoxin in relation to renal function, although lower doses of digoxin were prescribed to patients with the lowest estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), presumably as a result of dose adjustment for renal function.

Digoxin is a negatively chronotropic and positively inotropic agent. It inhibits the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase resulting in an increase in intracellular sodium and calcium ions leading to its positive inotropic effect. The negatively chronotropic effect is via an incompletely understood vagotonic effect. Apart from its cardiac uses, cardiac glycosides have been implicated in the regulation of many other physiological and pathophysiological processes. The cardiac glycoside, neriifolin, reduces cerebral infarct size in rodent cerebral hypoxia–ischemia models. Digitalis blocks cell proliferation and non-toxic doses of digitalis can induce apoptosis in different malignant cell lines. Digoxin might thus be useful in diseases associated with autotic cell death or autophagy in the kidneys.

Limitations

This was a retrospective analysis of patients with heart failure and therefore there may be confounding factors contributing to the changes in renal function.

Patients may have other co-morbidities such as diabetes and hypertension which may contribute to impaired renal function. We did not categorise patients into types of renal disease.

We have not reported the level of proteinuria as this is a surrogate marker and not a hard outcome measure. It may help separate patients into sub-groups but we did not want to do this due to the possible introduction of error.

### Digoxin (digox) [^3a7e7fb0]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

If rapid digitalization is considered medically appropriate, it may be achieved by administering a loading dose based upon projected peak digoxin body stores. Maintenance dose can be calculated as a percentage of the loading dose.
More gradual digitalization may be obtained by beginning an appropriate maintenance dose, thus allowing digoxin body stores to accumulate slowly. Steady-state serum digoxin concentrations will be achieved in approximately five half-lives of the drug for the individual patient. Depending upon the patient's renal function, this will take between 1 and 3 weeks.

Rapid Digitalization with a Loading Dose: Peak digoxin body stores of 8 to 12 mcg/kg should provide therapeutic effect with minimum risk of toxicity in most patients with heart failure and normal sinus rhythm. Because of altered digoxin distribution and elimination, projected peak body stores for patients with renal insufficiency should be conservative (i.e., 6 to 10 mcg/kg) [see PRECAUTIONS].

The loading dose should be administered in several portions, with roughly half the total given as the first dose. Additional fractions of this planned total dose may be given at 6 to 8-hour intervals, with careful assessment of clinical response before each additional dose.

If the patient's clinical response necessitates a change from the calculated loading dose of digoxin, then calculation of the maintenance dose should be based upon the amount actually given.

### ACC / AHA 2005 guideline update for the diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in the adult: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (writing committee to update the 2001 guidelines for the evaluation and management of heart failure): developed in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society [^ad63c4df]. Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA 2005 chronic heart failure guideline — digoxin initiation, dosing, and therapeutic range: Therapy with digoxin is commonly initiated and maintained at a dose of 0.125 to 0.25 mg daily, with low doses (0.125 mg daily or every other day) used initially if the patient is more than 70 years old, has impaired renal function, or has a low lean body mass; higher doses (digoxin, 0.375 to 0.50 mg daily) are rarely used or needed, and there is no reason to use loading doses to initiate therapy in heart failure. Doses that achieve plasma concentrations of 0.5 to 1.0 ng per mL are suggested, with retrospective data showing prevention of worsening HF at 0.5 to 0.9 ng per mL comparable to higher concentrations and risk‑adjusted mortality increasing when concentrations exceeded 1.0 ng per mL; the most conservative interpretation is that levels greater than 1.0 ng per mL were not associated with a superior outcome. Levels previously considered therapeutic up to 2 ng per mL may exert deleterious long‑term cardiovascular effects, and therapeutic‑range serum digoxin concentrations were associated with increased hospitalizations and increased risk of death due to arrhythmias or MI; accordingly, digoxin should be used with caution or not used at all in post‑MI patients, particularly with ongoing ischemia. The Writing Committee decided to change the level of recommendation for digitalis glycosides from Class I to Class IIa.

### Efficacy and safety of digoxin in acute heart failure triggered by tachyarrhythmia [^9701204a]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Efficacy of digoxin. Panels A and B show changes in heart rate from 0 (baseline) to 24 h and 48 h after receiving digoxin (at least 0.75 mg) in all patients and stratified by sex, respectively. Panels C and D show changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline to 24 h and 48 h after receiving digoxin (at least 0.75 mg) in all patients and stratified by sex, respectively. Panels E and F show changes in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from baseline to 24 h and 48 h after receiving digoxin (at least 0.75 mg) in all patients and stratified by sex, respectively. The solid line indicates the mean. Panels G, H, and I show the median dose, interquartile range, and 25% and 75% percentiles of digoxin, beta blocker (metoprolol equivalent dose), and amiodarone at 0, 24, and 48 h, respectively. In panel I, the median dose, interquartile range, and 25% and 75% percentiles of amiodarone at 0, 24, and 48 h are all zero (0). The dots represent the outliers.

These findings extend and corroborate observations from two propensity score‐matched studies regarding long‐term outcomes in patients hospitalized for AHF and atrial fibrillation in the United States.

Digoxin initiation was associated with a lower risk of AHF readmission and not with mortality.

These findings also seem to support the safety of an unadjusted loading dose in elderly patients with mild‐to‐moderate renal dysfunction, although this was not formally tested.

Some limitations warrant consideration when interpreting the findings of this study. First, this was a single‐center study. Second, this was an uncontrolled study and co‐administration of other negative chronotropic drugs after digoxin loading could have confounded the effect of digoxin. Therefore, it is important to highlight that no relevant changes in the doses of the beta blocker occurred and less than 10% of patients received additional doses of amiodarone within the 48 h study period.

In conclusion, digoxin was very effective in reducing the heart rate among patients with AHF triggered by tachyarrhythmia with a favorable safety profile. It offers physicians a widely available and inexpensive treatment option for these patients.

### Reverse translation in PBPK and QSP: going backwards in order to Go forward with confidence [^889faa0f]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

CASE EXAMPLES

Case 1

Purpose: Increasing ability to predict drug disposition in renal impairment.

Specific question to be addressed: Does renal impairment affect active secretion as much as glomerular filtration of drugs?

Scotcher et al. 10 recently tried to delineate the role of various factors in renal disposition of digoxin by a reverse translational modeling that involved application of a physiologically based kidney model to clinically observed data (both on the plasma level of drug as well as the urinary excretion rate) from renal impairment populations. The submodel of kidney within PBPK (MechhKiM 11) contained many active processes and went beyond the classical perfusion‐limited drug distribution into organs. However, this was challenged for an inadequacy of fully bottom‐up IVIVE approaches to recover some observed data (retro‐diction). The clinical observations for the modeling exercise came from divergent patient groups (healthy and renal impairment patients). Also, the observations were made both at the systemic circulation level (plasma drug concentrations vs. time) as well as in urine (rate of elimination). Those, which were coming from different studies, were assembled for assessment of altered renal secretion vs. glomerular filtration. Hence, the study combined the in vitro knowledge of drug affinity and handling by organic anion transporting peptide 4C1 (OATP4C1) and P‐glycoprotein (P‐gp) to build components of the model on tubular secretion and investigate the impact of age and renal impairment (moderate to severe) on renal drug disposition. The observed reduction in digoxin renal excretion clearance (CLR) in subjects with moderately impaired renal function relative to healthy was not consistent with models that assumed changes only in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Two hypotheses were tested based on reduction in either proximal tubule cell number or the OATP4C1 abundance and they successfully predicted a 59% decrease in renal clearance when these changes were proportional to reduction in GFR. However, the predicted proximal tubule concentration of the drug was only affected by changes in the transporter expression. Hence, the model not only provided evidence for reduction to active secretion (in line with GFR), as it also suggested as possible differentiation of the plausible causes based on consequences that might be associated with varying tubular concentrations in two scenarios. The implications of conditions that are not studied ("Pre"‐diction) were discussed such as those involving complex cases like transporter‐mediated drug–drug interactions (DDIs) in renal impairment patients.

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 Main findings

In this real‐life, community‐based cohort of optimally treated HFrEF patients, we found that SDC‐guided digoxin therapy was associated with increased all‐cause mortality, especially with SDC ≥ 0.9 ng/mL. In patients with SR and in new digoxin users all‐cause mortality was also significantly elevated compared to patients not treated with digoxin.

4.2 Serum‐concentration‐guided digoxin therapy

The narrow therapeutic window for the use of digitalis glycosides is well known. However, most publications that demonstrated an elevated mortality risk associated with digoxin did not report data about daily digoxin dose and/or serum levels. Even in the studies that reported such information, serum digoxin measurements were not performed in a systematic fashion. In the DIG trial SDC was measured only at 4 weeks and 1 year after the start of the study, while digoxin toxicity was followed only by signs and symptoms at 4 months, and every 4 months thereafter. 1 In a study by Freeman et al. comprising 2891 newly diagnosed HFrEF patients, 17 SDC was measured at all in 70% of patients and was measured just once in 27% of patients. Consequently, the lack of regular SDC control and/or higher SDC may have contributed to the adverse mortality effect of digoxin observed in these trials.

Our retrospective study demonstrates that even with an extremely close monitoring strategy, which were performed systematically in every patient, it was only possible to maintain SDC below 0.9 ng/mL in 42% of patients during the entire follow‐up. This may be partly due to the pharmacokinetics of digoxin (it eliminates mainly through the kidneys), and the fact that the renal function of HFrEF patients is typically impaired. It therefore appears to be reasonable to use digitoxin instead of digoxin in HFrEF because of its hepatic elimination. Evidence regarding the effects of digitoxin on morbidity and mortality or data about its safe therapeutic range is even more limited. In a single‐center study of 1020 ICD recipients, treatment with digoxin or digitoxin were associated with similarly increased mortality compared to digitalis nonusers. 27 The ongoing DIGIT‐HF trial will hopefully be able to clarify the place of digitoxin in therapy for HFrEF. 28 This trial is investigating the hypothesis that digitoxin — at serum concentrations in the lower therapeutic range — reduces mortality and morbidity in patients with HFrEF with or without AF.

Results

Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. There was a total of 1241 patients, with a mean age 72 (12) years; 64% of the patients were male. The majority were in New York Heart Association class II or III, with a median NT pro BNP of 1426 (632–2897) ng/l. There was no difference between the groups in NTproBNP, haemoglobin and renal function. At baseline, 75% of patients were taking an ACEi or ARB, 58% a beta-blocker and 25% an MRA.

BMI: body mass index, NYHA class: New York Heart Association class, LV: Left Ventricular, NTproBNP: N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide, eGFR: estimated glomerular filtration rate, ACEi: angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, ARB: Angiotensin II receptor blockers, MRA: mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, IHD: ischaemic heart disease, COPD: chronic pulmonary obstructive disease. ✱ p value between patients taking digoxin and patients not taking digoxin at baseline. P value between 4 groups of patients (digoxin throughout, never on digoxin, started digoxin after baseline, stopped digoxin after baseline)

Baseline eGFR was slightly lower in patients not on digoxin at baseline than in those taking digoxin (Table 1, Fig. 1). Compared to patients not on digoxin at baseline, patients taking digoxin at baseline were less likely to be in sinus rhythm, had a higher NTproBNP and were more likely to be taking a diuretic and/or a MRA. (Table 1).

Fig. 1
Distribution of renal function at baseline in patients on digoxin or not on digoxin at baseline

In the overall population, eGFR declined at a rate of − 3.2 (11.3) ml/min/1.73 m² per year. Compared to patients never on digoxin, patients on digoxin throughout had a significantly higher rate of decline in eGFR per year. In patients who started digoxin after baseline, the rate of decline in eGFR was numerically greater after starting digoxin but the change was not statistically significant. (Table 2).

### Medication-related adverse events and discordancies in cystatin C-based vs serum creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate in patients with cancer [^f62ecefe]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

In a cohort of 1869 patients with cancer with simultaneous SCr and cystatin C measurement as a part of clinical care, discordancies between eGFRcr and eGFRcys were common. We found a considerably higher rate of supratherapeutic drug levels and AEs associated with select renally cleared medications and increased risk of death in patients with an eGFRcys that was more than 30% lower than the eGFRcr compared with patients with a concordant eGFR or those whose eGFRcys was more than 30% higher than the eGFRcr.

This study found a higher rate of supratherapeutic vancomycin levels in patients with an eGFRcys that was more than 30% lower than the eGFRcr. Several studies have demonstrated that vancomycin clearance and target trough achievement are more accurately associated with eGFRcys than eGFRcr, including 1 study that found that a vancomycin dosing algorithm using eGFRcr-cys (n = 135) was more likely to achieve therapeutic vancomycin trough levels (50% vs 28%; P < .001) compared with an algorithm using eGFRcr alone (n = 264). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is another commonly used antibiotic in patients with cancer. By inhibiting tubular secretion of potassium, patients with a reduced eGFR are more likely to develop hyperkalemia when treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. In the present study, hyperkalemia occurred more commonly in patients with eGFR discordance. Digoxin is a renally cleared medication used in congestive heart failure or atrial fibrillation that has narrow therapeutic index and dose-dependent toxic effects. There have been conflicting reports regarding the use of SCr vs cystatin C to estimate digoxin clearance. Herein, we found that patients with an eGFRcys that was more than 30% lower than the eGFRcr were more likely to have supratherapeutic digoxin trough levels, and 2 patients had symptomatic digoxin toxic effects. Baclofen is a renally cleared muscle relaxant that is used in patients with cancer and may play a role in profound central nervous system suppression in patients with reduced GFR. The present study showed that symptomatic baclofen toxic effects were common in patients with an eGFRcys that was more than 30% lower than the eGFRcr, whereas no events occurred in patients with a concordant eGFR or those with an eGFRcys that was more than 30% higher than the eGFRcr. Overall, the findings suggest that relying on SCr-based eGFR alone for medication dosing may be inadequate in patients with cancer and highlight the need to consider using eGFRcr-cys when the eGFRcys was more than 30% lower than the eGFRcr.

### Digoxin (digox) [^e78aa501]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

Daily maintenance doses for each age group are given in Table 6 and should provide therapeutic effects with minimum risk of toxicity in most patients with heart failure and normal sinus rhythm. These recommendations assume the presence of normal renal function:

In children with renal disease, digoxin must be carefully titrated based upon clinical response.

It cannot be overemphasized that both adult and pediatric dosage guidelines provided are based upon average patient response and substantial individual variation can be expected. Accordingly, ultimate dosage selection must be based upon clinical assessment of the patient.

Atrial Fibrillation: Peak digoxin body stores larger than the 8 to 12 mcg/kg required for most patients with heart failure and normal sinus rhythm have been used for control of ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation. Doses of digoxin used for the treatment of chronic atrial fibrillation should be titrated to the minimum dose that achieves the desired ventricular rate control without causing undesirable side effects. Data are not available to establish the appropriate resting or exercise target rates that should be achieved.

Dosage Adjustment When Changing Preparations: The difference in bio-availability between Digoxin Injection or Digoxin Solution in Capsules and Digoxin Elixir Pediatric or Digoxin Tablets must be considered when changing patients from one dosage form to another.

Doses of 100 mcg (0.1 mg) and 200 mcg (0.2 mg) of Digoxin Solution in Capsules are approximately equivalent to 125 mcg (0.125 mg) and

250 mcg (0.25 mg) doses of Digoxin Tablets and Elixir Pediatric, respectively (see Table 1 in CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics).

### Digoxin [^6653c57d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Digoxin has a narrow therapeutic index, increased monitoring of serum digoxin concentrations and for potential signs and symptoms of clinical toxicity is necessary when initiating, adjusting, or discontinuing drugs that may interact with digoxin. Prescribers should consult the prescribing information of any drug which is co-prescribed with digoxin for potential drug interaction information.

7.1 P-Glycoprotein (PGP) Inducers/Inhibitors

Digoxin is a substrate of P-glycoprotein, at the level of intestinal absorption, renal tubular section and biliary-intestinal secretion. Therefore, drugs that induce/ inhibit P-glycoprotein have the potential to alter digoxin pharmacokinetics.

7.3 Potentially Significant Pharmacodynamic Drug Interactions

Because of considerable variability of pharmacodynamic interactions, the dosage of digoxin should be individualized when patients receive these medications concurrently.

### Digoxin (digox) [^4732360b]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

To allow adequate time for equilibration of digoxin between serum and tissue, sampling of serum concentrations should be done just before the next scheduled dose of the drug. If this is not possible, sampling should be done at least 6 to 8 hours after the last dose, regardless of the route of administration or the formulation used. On a once-daily dosing schedule, the concentration of digoxin will be 10% to 25% lower when sampled at 24 versus 8 hours, depending upon the patient's renal function. On a twice-daily dosing schedule, there will be only minor differences in serum digoxin concentrations whether sampling is done at 8 or 12 hours after a dose.

If a discrepancy exists between the reported serum concentration and the observed clinical response, the clinician should consider the following possibilities:

Analytical problems in the assay procedure.
Inappropriate serum sampling time.
Administration of a digitalis glycoside other than digoxin
Conditions (described in WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS) causing an alteration in the sensitivity of the patient to digoxin.
Serum digoxin concentration may decrease acutely during periods of exercise without any associated change in clinical efficacy due to increased binding of digoxin to skeletal muscle.

Heart Failure: Adults: Digitalization may be accomplished by either of two general approaches that vary in dosage and frequency of administration, but reach the same endpoint in terms of total amount of digoxin accumulated in the body.

Aliskiren: Do not co-administer aliskiren with telmisartan in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with telmisartan in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min).

Digoxin: When telmisartan was co-administered with digoxin, median increases in digoxin peak plasma concentration (49%) and in trough concentration (20%) were observed. Therefore, monitor digoxin levels when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing telmisartan for the purpose of keeping the digoxin level within the therapeutic range.

Lithium: Reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists including telmisartan. Therefore, monitor serum lithium levels during concomitant use.

Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors): In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including telmisartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving telmisartan and NSAID therapy.

The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including telmisartan may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

The digoxin dose received through breastfeeding is up to 4% of the neonatal maintenance dosage, which is unlikely to be clinically relevant. There are no data on the effects of digoxin on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production.

Data

Based on data from two lactation studies in a total of 13 breastfed infants, the digoxin concentrations in breast milk were between 0.4–1.0 ng/mL following 0.25 mg once daily dose of digoxin in the lactating mother. Thus, the amount of digoxin ingested daily by the infants is estimated to be between 0.03 to 0.16 mcg/kg/day. This translates to a relative infant dose of digoxin between 1 to 7% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose and about 0.2 to 4% of the neonatal maintenance dose.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of LANOXIN in the control of ventricular rate in children with atrial fibrillation have not been established.

The safety and effectiveness of LANOXIN in the treatment of heart failure in children have not been established in adequate and well-controlled studies. However, in published literature of children with heart failure of various etiologies (e.g., ventricular septal defects, anthracycline toxicity, patent ductus arteriosus), treatment with digoxin has been associated with improvements in hemodynamic parameters and in clinical signs and symptoms.

Newborn infants display considerable variability in their tolerance to digoxin. Premature and immature infants are particularly sensitive to the effects of digoxin, and the dosage of the drug must not only be reduced but must be individualized according to their degree of maturity.

8.5 Geriatric Use

The majority of clinical experience gained with digoxin has been in the elderly population. This experience has not identified differences in response or adverse effects between the elderly and younger patients. However, this drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, which should be based on renal function, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

### Assumption versus evidence: the case of digoxin in atrial fibrillation and heart failure [^fb8b19b6]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Knowledge of digoxin levels for proper risk adjustment in post hoc analyses

Because digoxin levels were not available in any of the post hoc analyses described, it is impossible to properly adjust risk for digoxin serum concentrations and to understand potentially underlying mechanisms attributable to digoxin as previously discussed, regardless of statistical methods used to correct for relevant confounders and besides the risk of prescription bias. This risk adjustment is of high interest since data from the DIG trial indicated a reduced mortality within digoxin serum concentrations of 0.5–0.9 ng/mL and an increased mortality at serum levels above 1.0 ng/mL. Especially in the AFFIRM study population with a chosen target serum concentration of digoxin above 1.0 ng/mL to achieve rate control, this would have been important for proper risk adjustment. In contrast, investigators in RACE II (no increase in mortality with digoxin) were not encouraged to pursue high digoxin levels although medical treatment was up-titrated to achieve rate control criteria.

In the DIG trial, digoxin dosing was determined according to an algorithm taking into account age, sex, weight, and renal function. In addition, in real clinical practice, potential drug interactions as well as circumstances changing digitalis sensitivity (e.g. hypokalaemia) also have to be reflected to avoid digitalis toxicity or side effects, which can be challenging. Because of the primarily renal excretion of digoxin, dose adjustment is important especially in patients with impaired renal function to avoid increases in digoxin serum concentrations driving mortality. Even if statistical methods adjust for increased risk due to impaired renal function at baseline or during follow-up, this most likely does not reflect the effect of high digoxin serum levels due to impaired renal excretion, because impaired renal function and high digoxin serum levels are considered to independently drive mortality in these patients. Therefore, knowledge of digoxin serum levels could be crucial for proper risk adjustment and interpretation.

### Digoxin use and digoxin toxicity in the post-DIG trial era [^5f56c9fb]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The advent of medical therapies for congestive heart failure that have proven survival benefits, specifically angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-adrenergic antagonists, and the aldosterone antagonists, have called into question the use of digoxin for patients with normal sinus rhythm, left ventricular dysfunction, and symptomatic heart failure. This issue appears to have been heightened after the publication of the results of the Digitalis Investigation Group (DIG) Trial in 1997 that did not demonstrate a statistically significant impact of digoxin on mortality.

Methods and Results

We used data from a large heart failure registry to examine digoxin use at the time of hospital admission for heart failure, a surveillance system for recording toxic drug exposures to describe patterns in digoxin toxicity and industry estimates for the use of digoxin antibody. Digoxin use has decreased significantly from 31.4% in late 2001 to 23.5% in late 2004 (P < .00001) independent of patient age, gender, or baseline creatinine. Conversely, the number of toxic or potentially toxic exposures to digoxin requiring hospitalization has not decreased.

Conclusion

Digoxin use is decreasing but there has not been a similar decline in cases of toxicity. Further analyses are required to delineate the reasons underlying these trends and the appropriateness of prescribing practices for both digoxin and its antidote.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

There have been no long-term studies performed in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential, nor have studies been conducted to assess the mutagenic potential of digoxin or its potential to affect fertility.

Pregnancy

Teratogenic Effects

Pregnancy Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with digoxin. It is also not known whether digoxin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. Digoxin should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.

Nursing Mothers

Studies have shown that digoxin concentrations in the mother's serum and milk are similar. However, the estimated exposure of a nursing infant to digoxin via breast feeding will be far below the usual infant maintenance dose. Therefore, this amount should have no pharmacologic effect upon the infant. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when digoxin is administered to a nursing woman.

Pediatric Use

Newborn infants display considerable variability in their tolerance to digoxin. Premature and immature infants are particularly sensitive to the effects of digoxin, and the dosage of the drug must not only be reduced but must be individualized according to their degree of maturity. Digitalis glycosides can cause poisoning in children due to accidental ingestion.

### Digoxin associates with mortality in ESRD [^0db96497]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

The safety of prescribing digoxin in ESRD is unknown. Hypokalemia, which frequently occurs among dialysis patients, may enhance the toxicity of digoxin. Here, we analyzed the association between digoxin prescription and survival in a retrospective cohort using covariate- and propensity score-adjusted Cox models to minimize the potential for confounding by indication. Among 120,864 incident hemodialysis patients, digoxin use associated with a 28% increased risk for death (hazard ratio [HR] 1.28; 95% confidence interval 1.25 to 1.31). Increasing serum digoxin level was also significantly associated with mortality (HR 1.19 per ng/ml increase; 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.35). This increased mortality risk with level was most pronounced in patients with lower predialysis serum potassium (K) levels (HR 2.53 [P = 0.01] for K < 4.3 mEq/L versus HR 0.86 [P = 0.35] for K > 4.6 mEq/L). In conclusion, digoxin use among patients who are on hemodialysis associates with increased mortality, especially among those with low predialysis K concentrations.

### Cardio-renal syndromes: report from the consensus conference of the acute dialysis quality initiative [^9a8c6be7]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Chronic cardio-renal syndrome (type 2)

Therapeutic approaches to patients with CHF are complex and involve the elimination and treatment of the underlying cause and/or disease leading to damage of the cardiovascular system and CHF progression. Self-care management is an important strategy in CHF, encompassing adherence to treatment, symptom recognition, and lifestyle changes (diet and nutrition, smoking cessation, exercise training).

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, ARBs, and aldosterone antagonistssignificantly reduce mortality and morbidity in CHF. The optimal approach is to combine ACE-I and beta-blocker, titrate dosages, to which either an ARB or aldosterone antagonist is subsequently added depending on clinical condition and patient characteristics. In patients unable to tolerate these agents, hydralazine and nitrates may be an option. Digoxin and diuretics improve symptoms in CHF but have no effect on mortality.

Cardiac re-synchronization therapy is now recommended for symptomatic CHF patients (NYHA III–IV) with poor left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and QRS prolongation, as are implantable cardiac defibrillators for both survivors of cardiac arrest and/or sustained ventricular arrhythmias and also for symptomatic CHF patients with impaired LVEF. In selected patients who do not respond to treatment, mechanical assist devices and/or cardiac transplantation may be appropriate.

Therapy of CHF with concomitant renal impairment is still not evidence-based, as these patients are generally excluded from CHF trials. – Typically, these patients are hypervolemic, and more intensive diuretic treatment is needed. Thiazide diuretics may be less effective, and loop diuretics are preferred. To improve natriuresis, loop diuretic infusions are more potent, and combinations with amiloride, aldosterone antagonists, or metolazone may be considered, as increasing doses of loop diuretics are associated with worse outcomes. In refractory cases, RRT may be required.

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and ARB initiation may cause deterioration in renal function, which is frequently transient and reversible. Patients with CKD or renal artery stenosis are at a higher risk, and careful monitoring is recommended. If renal function declines, then other secondary causes such as excessive diuresis, persistent hypotension, prescription of nephrotoxic agents or underlying renovascular disease should be excluded. Hyperkalaemia occurs with these agents and dietary restriction may be required.

Anaemia is often present in patients with type 2 CRS, and correction of anaemia may improve symptoms without increasing survival. Renal dysfunction is associated with altered drug clearances, and some drugs, e.g. digoxin and allopurinol, require dose adjustment, and the risk of spontaneous haemorrhage with warfarin is increased.

### Digoxin (digox) [^db62e7d1]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

Special Populations: Race differences in digoxin pharmacokinetics have not been formally studied. Because digoxin is primarily eliminated as unchanged drug via the kidney and because there are no important differences in creatinine clearance among races, pharmacokinetic differences due to race are not expected.

The clearance of digoxin can be primarily correlated with renal function as indicated by creatinine clearance. The Cockcroft and Gault formula for estimation of creatinine clearance includes age, body weight, and gender. Table 5 that provides the usual daily maintenance dose requirements of Digoxin Tablets based on creatinine clearance (per 70 kg) is presented in the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section.

Plasma digoxin concentration profiles in patients with acute hepatitis generally fell within the range of profiles in a group of healthy subjects.

Pharmacodynamic and Clinical Effects: The times to onset of pharmacologic effect and to peak effect of preparations of digoxin are shown in Table 2:

Hemodynamic Effects: Digoxin produces hemodynamic improvement in patients with heart failure. Short- and long-term therapy with the drug increases cardiac output and lowers pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and systemic vascular resistance. These hemodynamic effects are accompanied by an increase in the left ventricular ejection fraction and a decrease in end-systolic and end-diastolic dimensions.

Chronic Heart Failure: Two 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies enrolled 178 (RADIANCE trial) and 88 (PROVED trial) patients with NYHA class II or III heart failure previously treated with digoxin, a diuretic, and an ACE inhibitor (RADIANCE only) and randomized them to placebo or treatment with digoxin. Both trials demonstrated better preservation of exercise capacity in patients randomized to digoxin. Continued treatment with digoxin reduced the risk of developing worsening heart failure, as evidenced by heart failure-related hospitalizations and emergency care and the need for concomitant heart failure therapy. The larger study also showed treatment-related benefits in NYHA class and patients' global assessment. In the smaller trial, these trended in favor of a treatment benefit.

### Use of renal risk drugs in a nation-wide Polish older adult population: an analysis of polSenior database [^57059d7b]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common entity among older adult subjects. After the age of 40, kidney function assessed with creatinine clearance decreases by 8–9 ml/min with each decade of life. This decrease results from a normal biological process of aging and superimposing diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension. The prevalence of CKD in the general population is estimated at approximately 11% and increases with age reaching 45% in subjects aged 80 years or more.

Numerous medications commonly used in the older adults should be avoided in subjects with impaired kidney function because of their nephrotoxic properties, e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), methotrexate, loop and thiazide diuretics, ranitidine, some antibiotics. Other drugs, e.g. digoxin, gliclazide, and atenolol are excreted by the kidney and require dose adjustment in subjects with impaired kidney function. The process of drug selection and dose-adjustment is particularly challenging in the older population, because of common comorbidity and associated polypharmacy. Incidences of adverse drug reactions in patients with renal impairment are higher than in subjects with normal kidney function. In the GIFA study (Gruppo Italiano di Farmacovigilanza nell'Anziano; the Italian Group of Farmacoepidemiology in the Elderly) low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or creatinine clearance were significantly more prevalent in hospitalized elderly patients with adverse reactions caused by hydrosoluble drugs, esp. diuretics, digoxin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), and antihyperglycemic agents. Adverse drug reactions often result from errors in prescribing or the lack of dose adjustment. Despite the recognized importance of inappropriate drug prescriptions in older adults with CKD, the appropriate choice of medication and dosage adjustment are often neglected in daily clinical practice. Partially it is caused by utilization of eGFR provided by laboratories along with serum concentration of creatinine, calculated according to the short Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (sMDRD), or the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formulas, and skipping calculation of Cockcroft-Gault creatinine clearance (CC) used in drug registration process and required for dose adjustment.

### Characteristics and outcomes of suspected digoxin toxicity and immune fAb treatment over the past two decades-2000-2020 [^0733e2a8]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

The role of digoxin in clinical practice has narrowed over time. Data on digoxin toxicity trends and outcomes are variable and lack granularity for treatment outcomes. This study aimed to address data gaps in digoxin toxicity trends and outcomes in patients treated with or without digoxin immune fab (DIF). This single-center analysis examined patients with signs/symptoms concerning digoxin toxicity, defined as hospital admission or emergency department visit with elevated digoxin serum concentrations (> 2 ng/ml) and/or a primary diagnosis code of digoxin toxicity and/or DIF order. Between 2000 and 2020, 727 patients were identified with signs concerning for digoxin toxicity with a mortality rate of 12.7% during admission and 42.7% at 1 year. DIF was ordered in 9% of cases. Incidence of digoxin toxicity per 1,000 patients with a digoxin prescription and frequency of DIF treatment fluctuated over time without a clear trend toward increase or reduction. DIF-treated patients demonstrated a heavier co-morbidity burden and lower presenting heart rates (median 53 [39.5 to 69.5] vs 77 [64.0 to 91.5] beats/min, p < 0.001), worse renal function (median estimated glomerular filtration rate, 30.3 [14.8 to 48.6] vs 40.0 [24.2 to 61.2] ml/min/1.73 m², p = 0.013), and higher potassium (median 4.5 [4.0 to 5.3] vs 4.3 [3.9 to 4.8] mEq/L, p = 0.022). Compared with a matched cohort, DIF-treated patients experienced a nonsignificant, numerically lower in-hospital mortality (8.2% vs 15.8%, p = 0.199) and 30-day all-cause hospitalization (14.3% vs 24.7%, p = 0.112) and similar 6-month and 1-year hospitalization and mortality. In conclusion, digoxin toxicity remains a pertinent public health issue despite reduction in digoxin utilization. DIF therapy is used in a medically complex population with a high-acuity illness at presentation and is associated with nonsignificant trends toward reduced in-hospital mortality and early readmission that are attenuated over time.

2.4 Maintenance Dosing in Pediatric Patients Less Than 10 Years Old

The starting maintenance dose for heart failure in pediatric patients less than 10 years old is based on lean body weight, renal function, age, and concomitant products [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The recommended starting maintenance dose for pediatric patients between 5 years and 10 years old is given in Table 4. These recommendations assume the presence of normal renal function.

2.5 Monitoring to Assess Safety, Efficacy, and Therapeutic Blood Levels

Monitor for signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity and clinical response. Adjust dose based on toxicity, efficacy, and blood levels.

Serum digoxin levels less than 0.5 ng/mL have been associated with diminished efficacy, while levels above 2 ng/mL have been associated with increased toxicity without increased benefit.

Interpret the serum digoxin concentration in the overall clinical context, and do not use an isolated measurement of serum digoxin concentration as the basis for increasing or decreasing the digoxin tablets dose. Serum digoxin concentrations may be falsely elevated by endogenous digoxin-like substances [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. If the assay is sensitive to these substances, consider obtaining a baseline digoxin level before starting digoxin tablets and correct post-treatment values by the reported baseline level.

Obtain serum digoxin concentrations just before the next scheduled digoxin tablets dose or at least 6 hours after the last dose. The digoxin concentration is likely to be 10 to 25% lower when sampled right before the next dose (24 hours after dosing) compared to sampling 8 hours after dosing (using once-daily dosing). However, there will be only minor differences in digoxin concentrations using twice daily dosing whether sampling is done at 8 or 12 hours after a dose.

2.6 Switching from Intravenous Digoxin to Oral Digoxin

When switching from intravenous to oral digoxin formulations, make allowances for differences in bioavailability when calculating maintenance dosages (see Table 6).

### Use of renal risk drugs in a nation-wide Polish older adult population: an analysis of polSenior database [^df88291c]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Numerous medications should be avoided, or require dose adjustment in subjects with impaired kidney function. We aimed to assess the prevalence of potentially inappropriate use of renal risk drugs in a nation-wide, community-dwelling Polish older adult population.

Methods

We analysed regular intake of 38 medications that should be avoided, requiring dose modification, increase the risk of pre-renal kidney injury, or may cause potassium retention in subjects with moderately to severely impaired renal function in the PolSenior data base (N = 4514, mean age 76 ± 11yrs). Kidney function was assessed with short Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula estimated glomerular filtration rate (sMDRD) and Cockcroft-Gault creatinine clearance (CC).

Results

There were 855 (19%) individuals with sMDRD < 60ml/min/1.73 m², and 1734 (38%) with CC < 60ml/min. Among drugs that should be avoided, spironolactone (20.4% of patients as classified by sMDRD and 17.5% by CC), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (13.4 and 11.3%), hydrochlorothiazide (11.1 and 11.0%), and metformin (6.9 and 8.2%) were most frequently used. The most frequently used drugs requiring dose modification were piracetam (13.9% by sMDRD, and 11.9% by CC), digoxin (8.3 and 8.8%), and gliclazide (6.8 and 5.9%). Classification of a drug use as 'appropriate' or 'inappropriate' was discordant depending on the method of kidney function assessment (sMDRD or CC) in up to 30%. Subgroups with sMDRD < 60ml/min/1.73m² and with CC < 60ml/min were taking ≥ 2 drugs increasing the risk of pre-renal kidney injury more frequently than individuals with better kidney function (46.6 vs. 23.1 and 33.0% vs. 24.4%, respectively). There were 24.7% of individuals with sMDRD < 60ml/min/1.73m 2 and 18.0% with CC < 60ml/min taking 2 or more drugs increasing serum potassium level. The proportion of subjects with hyperkalaemia increased with the number of such drugs.

Conclusions

Use of drugs that should be avoided or require dose adjustment due to renal impairment, and potentially inappropriate drug combinations is a common problem in older adults in Poland. Assessment of kidney function with sMDRD may result in overlooking of requirements for dose adjustment formulated based on creatinine clearance.

Trial Registration

### The assessment of renal function in relation to the use of drugs in elderly in nursing homes; a cohort study [^359685d2]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Renal function decreases with age. Dosage adjustment according to renal function is indicated for many drugs, in order to avoid adverse reactions of medications and/or aggravation of renal impairment. There are several ways to assess renal function in the elderly, but no way is ideal. The aim of the study was to explore renal function in elderly subjects in nursing homes and the use of pharmaceuticals that may be harmful to patients with renal impairment.

Methods

243 elderly subjects living in nursing homes were included. S-creatinine and s-cystatin c were analysed. Renal function was estimated using Cockcroft-Gault formula, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and cystatin C-estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Concomitant medication was registered and four groups of renal risk drugs were identified: metformin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), angiotensin-converting enzyme -inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers and digoxin. Descriptive statistics and the Kappa test for concordance were used.

Results

Reduced renal function (cystatin C-estimated GFR < 60 ml/min) was seen in 53%. Normal s-creatinine was seen in 41% of those with renal impairment. Renal risk drugs were rather rarely prescribed, with exception for ACE-inhibitors. Poor concordance was seen between the GFR estimates as concluded by other studies.

Conclusions

The physician has to be observant on renal function when prescribing medications to the elderly patient and not only rely on s-creatinine level. GFR has to be estimated before prescribing renal risk drugs, but using different estimates may give divergence in the results.

### DIGitoxin to improve ouTcomes in patients with advanced chronic heart failure (DIGIT-HF): baseline characteristics compared to recent randomized controlled heart failure trials [^af953178]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical characteristics in‐and comparator trials

DIGIT‐HF was designed to recruit patients with chronic HFrEF into a simple trial design, with the objective of facilitating transferability to the 'real world'. As such, the trial was not subject to selection criteria such as natriuretic peptide concentrations or recent HF hospitalizations. As natriuretic peptide determination was (and often is still) not standard in patients with HF in many countries, our design enables application of the results also in low‐ and medium‐income countries where digitalis is often used in HFrEF in clinical practice. However, to ensure the enrichment of a higher risk population inclusion criteria with combination of NYHA II/LVEF < 30% and NYHA III/LVEF < 40% were chosen. Digitoxin was selected over digoxin due to its advantageous pharmacokinetic profile, which results in more stable serum concentrations compared with digoxin, even in patients with advanced renal dysfunction. Thus, there was no need for renal function inclusion criteria and to repeatedly monitor digitoxin serum concentrations, supporting the simplicity of the trial. Importantly, during the entire trial period no safety signals regarding digitoxin dosing have been reported also supporting the defined dosing protocol and trial design. Effective digitoxin dose adjustment with the defined dosing protocol to enable a simple trial performance was supported by blinded analysis of digitoxin dosing in the first 394 patients enrolled in DIGIT‐HF previously published. This analysis demonstrated the necessity for dose adjustment in ~40% of patients, with the majority (92%) of patients having a dose reduction from 0.07 mg to 0.05 mg digitoxin once daily and only 8% having a dose increase from 0.07 to 0.1 mg digitoxin once daily. Digitoxin dose–concentration relationships in the overall trial population and associations with trial endpoints will be performed within the final trial analysis. The DIG trial indicated the beneficial effects of digoxin on outcomes especially in the subgroup of patients with LVEF < 30% or NYHA class ≥ III. Therefore, the inclusion criteria for DIGIT‐HF were matched to those of the DIG trial: NYHA class II with LVEF ≤ 30%, or NYHA classes III–IV with LVEF ≤ 40%. Consequently, the DIGIT‐HF patient population exhibited a higher proportion of patients with a pronounced HF burden (70% in NYHA classes III–IV) compared to the recent HFrEF trials PARADIGM‐HF, DAPA‐HF, and EMPEROR‐Reduced (25–32%), respectively. DIGIT‐HF may therefore close an important evidence gap for the effective treatment of patients with chronic HFrEF and a pronounced HF burden (NYHA classes III–IV). Despite the option to enrol patients up to an LVEF of 40%, a significant proportion of DIGIT‐HF patients had LVEF ≤ 30% (65%), which is comparable to EMPEROR‐Reduced (73%). The mean LVEF of 30% was similar to other recent HFrEF trials, and the median time from HF diagnosis of 5 years confirms the inclusion of patients with chronic HF.

### Digoxin therapy does not improve outcomes in patients with advanced heart failure on contemporary medical therapy [^214c86c8]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The impact of digoxin on outcomes of patients with advanced heart failure (HF) receiving optimal contemporary therapy is not known.

Methods and Results

We retrospectively reviewed data of 455 advanced HF patients referred for transplant evaluation (age, 52 ± 12 years; ejection fraction, 18.3 ± 8%); 227 (49.9%) were on digoxin at baseline. Primary outcome was death (n = 101), urgent transplantation (n = 14), or ventricular assist device implantation (n = 4); secondary outcomes included HF and all-cause hospitalizations. Digoxin use was evaluated (1) in the original cohort; (2) in a propensity score-matched subset (n = 322); (3) as a time-dependent covariate; and (4) after adjustment for Seattle Heart Failure Score. Patients were on optimal therapy: angiotensin-II modulation, 92.5%; beta-blockers, 91.2%; aldosterone antagonists, 45.6%; and devices, 71.0%. After a median of 27 months, 83 of 277 (36.6%) patients treated with digoxin versus 36 of 228 (15.8%) patients without digoxin met primary outcome (hazard ratio [HR], 2.28; 95% CI, 1.51 to 3.43; P < 0.001). This risk persisted in the matched subset (HR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.09 to 2.75; P = 0.021) and with time-varying digoxin use (HR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.23 to 3.41; P = 0.011). Digoxin was associated with higher risk among patients in sinus rhythm compared with atrial fibrillation. Digoxin was not associated with improvement in either all-cause or HF hospitalization rates. These results were similar across sex and race and when adjusted for Seattle Heart Failure Score and renal function.

Conclusions

This study suggests that digoxin therapy may be of no benefit in patients with advanced HF referred for cardiac transplantation who received optimal medical therapy. Treatment with digoxin should be used cautiously in such patients because of risk for adverse outcomes.

### Digoxin-specific fab and therapeutic plasma exchange for digitalis intoxication and renal failure [^1178d18c]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Treatment of chronic digitalis intoxication includes suspension of drug intake, which may be sufficient in case of mild manifestations, and supportive measures. Severe bradycardia requires the administration of atropine or isoproterenol; placement of a temporary pacemaker may be required in case of absent response to pharmacological therapy. Severe and life-threatening manifestations should be treated with digoxin-specific fragment antigen binding antibodies (Fab). Therapeutic plasma exchange has been suggested, in addition to Fab therapy, to maximize the clearance of Fab-digoxin complexes in patients with renal failure. To date, few case reports have described the use of such a therapeutic approach; currently, extracorporeal methods are not recommended as part of the treatment of digitalis intoxication, and stronger evidence is required to establish their benefit.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Therapy of digoxin mediated bradycardia attributable to either SND or atrioventricular block includes administration of digoxin Fab and avoidance of dialysis: In patients with bradycardia associated with symptoms or hemodynamic compromise in the setting of digoxin toxicity, digoxin Fab antibody fragment is reasonable to increase heart rate and improve symptoms, whereas in similar patients dialysis is not recommended for removal of digoxin. Each vial of 40 mg of digoxin Fab binds approximately 0.5 mg of digoxin, clinical response rates to digoxin Fab are as high as 80% to 90%, and patients with hyperkalemia or arrhythmias with digoxin serum levels of > 2 ng/mL are at increased risk of death. A systematic review reported 10 observational series including a total 2,080 patients with a clinical response of improvement to reversal of symptoms in 50% to 90% of patients within 30 to 45 minutes, with adverse effects occurring in < 10% of patients. Separately, a systematic review of 77 in vitro, animal, and human case reports and series comprising 84 patients found that dialysis is unlikely to improve the outcome of patients with digoxin toxicity; hemodialysis may be considered for treatment of associated life-threatening hyperkalemia.

✱ p < 0.05 vs. renally appropriate use

sMDRD short Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study equation; CC Creatinine clearance calculated with Cockcroft-Gault equation

Among medications that should be avoided, spironolactone (prevalence of potentially inappropriate use 17.5% by CC, and 20.4% by sMDRD), NSAIDs (11.3 and 13.4%), hydrochlorothiazide (11.0 and 11.1%), metformin (8.2 and 6.9%), and amiloride (6.4 and 4.3%) were most frequently used. The most frequently used drugs requiring dose modification at given level of renal impairment were piracetam (prevalence of potentially inappropriate use 11.9% by CC, and 13.9% by sMDRD), digoxin (8.8 and 8.3%), gliclazide (5.9 and 6.8%), and ranitidine (3.9 and 3.7%).

We identified individuals taking a combination of two or more drugs increasing the risk of pre-renal impairment of kidney function (diuretics + NSAIDs + ACEI or ARB) (Table 4). In the total population, 1251 (27.7%) of subjects were taking 2–5 of such drugs. Intake of two or more drugs was more frequent in patients with CKD stage 3–5 as compared with subjects with better kidney function, despite the method of kidney function evaluation (CC: 33.0% of patients vs. 24.4%, p < 0.05; sMDRD: 46.6 vs. 23.1%, p < 0.05). Combinations of ACEI/ARB and diuretics were more prevalent in subjects with CC < 60 ml/min or sMDRD < 60 ml/min/1.73 m² as compared to individuals with better kidney function. Combinations of NSAIDS and diuretics, as well as triple combinations, were more frequently used by subjects with sMDRD < 60 ml/min/1.73 m² as compared to those with higher sMDRD.

### ACC / AHA 2005 guideline update for the diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in the adult: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (writing committee to update the 2001 guidelines for the evaluation and management of heart failure): developed in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society [^50eac19e]. Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA 2005 chronic heart failure guideline — digoxin adverse effects, toxicity thresholds, and drug interactions: When administered with attention to dose and to factors that alter its disposition, digoxin is well tolerated by most patients with HF, but principal adverse reactions occur primarily with large doses, and the major side effects include cardiac arrhythmias, gastrointestinal symptoms, and neurological complaints. Overt digitalis toxicity is commonly associated with serum digoxin levels greater than 2 ng per mL, though toxicity may occur with lower levels, especially if hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or hypothyroidism coexists. The concomitant use of clarithromycin, erythromycin, amiodarone, itraconazole, cyclosporine, verapamil, or quinidine can increase serum digoxin concentrations and may increase the likelihood of digitalis toxicity, and the dose of digoxin should be reduced if treatment with these drugs is initiated. Spironolactone does not inhibit the disposition of digoxin; cross‑reactivity of some digoxin antibody assays with spironolactone confounded earlier attempts to assess the effect of spironolactone on digoxin clearance. In addition, a low lean body mass and impaired renal function can elevate serum digoxin levels, and one analysis suggested that women may not benefit from digoxin therapy and may be at increased risk for death with such therapy.

Europace (2018). Medium credibility.

Antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) in renal impairment and dialysis — procainamide and sotalol should be avoided in patients treated with haemodialysis; the dose of flecainide should be at least 50% of the usual recommended dose, and dialysis has little impact on amiodarone clearance with no dosage adjustment necessary. Renal function should be assessed in all patients treated with AAD. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) need to be estimated through the Cockcroft–Gault formula, the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation, or the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation, and AAD dosage adapted to specific AAD pharmacokinetics.

### The effect of digoxin on mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure [^dbaae99b]. The New England Journal of Medicine (1997). Excellent credibility.

The study DIG was published by Digitalis Investigation Group. and colleagues in 1997 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the DIG study, the trial question was: what is the role of digoxin in patients with a LVEF ≤ 0.45 being treated with diuretics and ACE inhibitors? In the DIG study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the DIG study, the population was: 6800 patients (1520 female, 5280 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with an LVEF ≤ 0.45 being treated with diuretics and ACE inhibitors. The key exclusion criteria were age < 21 years, myocardial infarction or cardiac surgery within 4 weeks, unstable or refractory angina < 1 month, acute myocarditis, HCM, cor pulmonale, or complex congenital heart disease. In the DIG study, the interventions were: n = 3397 digoxin (0.25 mg/day) n = 3403 placebo (matching placebo per day). In the DIG study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death from all causes (34.8% vs. 35.1%; RR 0.99, 99% CI 0.91 to 1.07). In the DIG study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in hospitalization for worsening HF (26.8% vs. 34.7%; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.79) No significant difference in death attributed to worsening HF (11.6% vs. 13.2%; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.01) No significant difference in death from cardiovascular causes (29.9% vs. 29.5%; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.1). In the DIG study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in VF or tachycardia. significant differences in digoxin toxicity (11.9% vs. 7.9%), supraventricular arrhythmia (2.5% vs. 1.2%) and second or third degree AV block (1.2% vs. 0.4%). In the DIG study, the conclusion was: in patients with an LVEF ≤ 0.45 being treated with diuretics and ACE inhibitors, digoxin was not superior to placebo with respect to death from all causes.
