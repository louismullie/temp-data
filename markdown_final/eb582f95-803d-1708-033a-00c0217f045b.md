## Question

Why we add vancomycin in intraabdominal infection

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why we add vancomycin in intra-abdominal infection and in which situations it is appropriate to do so. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and classification of intra-abdominal infection. Then, I should verify which pathogens vancomycin actually covers and which it does not. Next, I will review guideline positions on empiric vancomycin use, distinguishing community-acquired from healthcare-associated disease and low- versus high-risk patients. After that, I need to check the specific scenarios where vancomycin is indicated, including MRSA risk, enterococcal coverage gaps, and beta-lactam allergy. Finally, I will consider dosing, monitoring, and stewardship principles to ensure safe and effective use, and I will reconcile any conflicting guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Intra-abdominal infections are broadly categorized as community-acquired versus healthcare-associated, and management is risk-stratified by severity, patient factors, and likely pathogens, with source control and timely antibiotics as cornerstones. Vancomycin is not part of routine empiric therapy for most patients, so I need to ensure I am not overgeneralizing its use [^111UnQKp] [^115BbzDN].

> I need to verify what vancomycin actually covers. Vancomycin is active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus species, but it has no activity against gram-negative rods or anaerobes, which are common in intra-abdominal infections. Therefore, vancomycin should be added only when there is a credible risk of MRSA or when enterococcal coverage is specifically indicated and not already provided by the base regimen [^112fCLif].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm the guideline stance on empiric vancomycin. The 2024 Surgical Infection Society update recommends against vancomycin for empiric therapy in both low- and high-risk patients, reflecting concerns about overtreatment and limited benefit. Earlier SIS guidance allowed consideration in higher-risk patients, but the most recent update moves away from routine empiric vancomycin, so I should align with the 2024 recommendation as the current standard [^115BbzDN] [^112fCLif].

> Wait, let me verify the specific scenarios where vancomycin is still appropriate despite the 2024 stance. For MRSA risk in healthcare-associated intra-abdominal infection, particularly in patients colonized with MRSA or with multiple healthcare-associated risk factors, adding vancomycin is reasonable. Similarly, when the base regimen lacks reliable enterococcal activity, such as with cefepime plus metronidazole or aztreonam plus metronidazole, adding vancomycin addresses that gap. And in severe beta-lactam allergy, aztreonam plus metronidazole plus vancomycin is an accepted alternative regimen, though it should be reserved for those who truly cannot receive beta-lactams [^116tnpB2] [^notfound].

> I should double-check enterococcal nuances. Enterococcus faecalis is usually susceptible to ampicillin, so ampicillin is preferred when targeting E. faecalis, whereas Enterococcus faecium is frequently ampicillin-resistant, making vancomycin a reasonable empiric choice when E. faecium is suspected in high-risk or healthcare-associated settings. However, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus requires linezolid or daptomycin rather than vancomycin, so I need to ensure I am not assuming vancomycin will cover VRE [^112fCLif] [^115TxeUH].

> Let me consider dosing and safety. Standard vancomycin dosing in adults is 15–20 mg/kg IV every 8–12 hours, with attention to renal function and therapeutic drug monitoring to mitigate nephrotoxicity risk. In critically ill patients, altered pharmacokinetics may necessitate loading doses and consideration of continuous or extended infusions for time-dependent agents, though the evidence base in IAI is limited and should be individualized [^111GBjx7] [^112RQ6aB].

> Next, I should review stewardship and de-escalation. Obtaining intra-abdominal cultures at the time of source control enables pathogen-directed therapy and timely de-escalation. The 2024 SIS update supports de-escalation in ICU patients with healthcare-associated IAI, and broader data show de-escalation is feasible without harm in polymicrobial healthcare-associated infections, reinforcing the principle of narrowing therapy once cultures return [^116cYbat] [^112wbkZQ].

> But wait, what if the infection is community-acquired and the patient is not high risk. In that scenario, routine empiric vancomycin is not recommended, and narrower-spectrum regimens such as ceftriaxone plus metronidazole or ertapenem are preferred, with piperacillin-tazobactam or a carbapenem reserved for higher-risk community-acquired cases. This aligns with both the 2024 SIS update and contemporary stewardship frameworks [^115BbzDN] [^1168rSxh].

> I will now examine pediatric considerations briefly. In children, vancomycin may be added when MRSA or ampicillin-resistant enterococci are suspected, particularly in healthcare-associated infections or severe presentations, but again this should be risk-based and de-escalated promptly when cultures allow [^116BDQii] [^114WEp1Y].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line to ensure internal consistency. We add vancomycin in intra-abdominal infection when there is a credible risk of MRSA, when enterococcal coverage is indicated and not provided by the base regimen, or when a beta-lactam–sparing regimen is necessary due to severe allergy. Otherwise, routine empiric vancomycin is discouraged by current guidelines, and therapy should be narrowed promptly once cultures and clinical response guide pathogen-directed choices [^115BbzDN] [^116fjYA1] [^116tnpB2] [^115jp77m].

---

Vancomycin is added to intra-abdominal infection regimens when there is a **high risk of MRSA or VRE** [^116fjYA1] — such as healthcare-associated infections, severe sepsis/septic shock, prior broad-spectrum antibiotics, or known colonization — because standard regimens often lack reliable gram-positive coverage [^116tnpB2]. It is also used when **beta-lactam allergy** necessitates aztreonam-based regimens, which require vancomycin for gram-positive coverage [^115jp77m] [^113uVMbY]. Routine use is not recommended for low-risk community-acquired infections due to resistance risk and limited benefit [^115BbzDN]; vancomycin should be stopped once cultures exclude MRSA/VRE or an alternative agent is identified [^114JvWNU].

---

## Indications for vancomycin use in intra-abdominal infections

Vancomycin is **not routinely used** for all intra-abdominal infections; its use is reserved for specific clinical scenarios:

- **MRSA risk**: Healthcare-associated infections, severe sepsis/septic shock, prior broad-spectrum antibiotics, or known MRSA colonization [^116fjYA1] [^111LDuZi].
- **VRE risk**: Known VRE colonization or high-risk settings (e.g. prolonged hospitalization, prior broad-spectrum antibiotics) [^11141y12].
- **Beta-lactam allergy**: Aztreonam-based regimens require vancomycin for gram-positive coverage [^115jp77m] [^113uVMbY].

---

## Pathogens covered by vancomycin

Vancomycin provides **coverage against**:

| **Pathogen** | **Clinical significance in iai** |
|-|-|
| Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) | - Significant in healthcare-associated IAIs <br/> - Associated with severe infections and complications [^116fjYA1] |
| Vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus species (E. faecalis, E. faecium) | - Common in healthcare-associated IAIs <br/> - Associated with increased morbidity and mortality [^115TCg2P] [^114EjZiS] |
| Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) | - Rare but serious <br/> - Requires alternative agents (e.g. linezolid, daptomycin) [^115TCg2P] [^112fCLif] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **selective use** of vancomycin:

- **Routine use discouraged**: Not recommended for low-risk community-acquired IAIs due to limited benefit and resistance risk [^115BbzDN] [^112nayjC].
- **High-risk scenarios**: Recommended for severe sepsis/septic shock, healthcare-associated infections, or known MRSA/VRE colonization [^116fjYA1] [^11141y12].
- **Beta-lactam allergy**: Aztreonam-based regimens should include vancomycin for gram-positive coverage [^115jp77m] [^113uVMbY].

---

## Risks and considerations

Vancomycin use carries **potential risks and considerations**:

- **Nephrotoxicity**: Requires monitoring of renal function and drug levels [^111eRYXS] [^116wLKhk].
- **Resistance**: Overuse contributes to VRE and MRSA resistance [^113AQabE] [^115hGBDS].
- **Cost**: Higher cost compared to standard regimens [^notfound].

---

## Clinical outcomes and effectiveness

Evidence on routine vancomycin use in IAIs is **limited**; selective use in high-risk patients improves outcomes by covering resistant gram-positive pathogens, whereas routine use in low-risk patients does not improve outcomes and increases resistance risk [^113rk6F2] [^115BbzDN].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Vancomycin recommended?** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Community-acquired IAI, low risk | No | - Limited benefit <br/> - Resistance risk [^115BbzDN] [^112nayjC] |
| Healthcare-associated IAI, high risk | Yes | - MRSA/VRE risk <br/> - Improved outcomes [^116fjYA1] [^11141y12] |
| Severe sepsis/septic shock | Yes | - Broad-spectrum coverage <br/> - Improved outcomes [^111LDuZi] [^111MwnHB] |
| Beta-lactam allergy | Yes | Gram-positive coverage needed [^115jp77m] [^113uVMbY] |

---

Vancomycin is added to intra-abdominal infection regimens when there is a **high risk of MRSA or VRE**, or when beta-lactam allergy necessitates gram-positive coverage. Routine use is discouraged due to resistance risk and limited benefit in low-risk patients; therapy should be de-escalated once cultures exclude resistant gram-positive pathogens [^115BbzDN] [^114JvWNU].

An extensive literature review demonstrated some evidence in favour of using empirical therapy with enterococcal coverage for IAIs in the following cases: 1) immunocompromised patients or patients with hospital-acquired/post-operative cIAIs; 2) patients with cIAIs who have previously received cephalosporins and other broad-spectrum antibiotics selecting Enterococcus spp.; 3) patients with cIAIs and valvular heart disease or prosthetic intravascular material, at high risk of endocarditis. The ideal therapeutic regimen for these high-risk patients remains to be determined, but empirical therapy directed against enterococci should be considered.

Nearly all strains of E. faecalis, including some strains of vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis, are susceptible to ampicillin. In patients with IAIs, E. faecium is increasingly encountered, particularly in patients with hospital-acquired IAIs. In contrast to E. faecalis, nearly all strains of E. faecium are resistant to ampicillin and the growing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant strains is an area of concern, although the main clinical problem seems strictly related to BSIs. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis showed a higher mortality for vancomycin-resistant E. faecium BSIs compared with vancomycin-sensitive E. faecium BSIs (RR = 1.46; 95% CI 1.17–1.82). For patients with VanA-type vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, linezolid or daptomycin are the preferred agents. Both linezolid and daptomycin have good in vitro activity against vancomycin-resistant E. faecium although higher daily doses are needed. For VanB-type resistant strains teicoplanin should be considered the preferred drug.

What are the optimal daily doses and modality of administration of antibiotics in patients with IAIs?

19. In patients with IAIs and sepsis or septic shock, appropriate dose and administration mode of antibiotics should include: 1) proper loading dose, 2) extended or continuous infusion for beta-lactams and 3) knowledge of the peritoneal/biliary penetration rate (Low quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

20. Beta-lactam antibiotics exhibit good penetration rate in the peritoneal exudate fluid. In critically ill patients, continuous infusion should be implemented to grant optimal PK/PD target attainment at the infection site (Low quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

Administering adequate doses of antibiotics should be based on the intrinsic pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) characteristics of each antibiotic class, the specific agent, and the specific pathophysiologic characteristics of the patient.

Surgical Infection Society — anti-staphylococcal therapy in hospital-acquired intra-abdominal infection (HA-IAI) recommends risk assessment and empiric coverage for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as follows: We suggest that patients with HA-IAI known to be colonized with MRSA and those with multiple healthcare-associated risk factors for MRSA colonization, including advanced age, co-morbid medical conditions, previous hospitalization or surgery, and significant recent exposure to antibiotics or known VRE be considered at risk for infection from MRSA (Grade 2-B). For empiric therapy in patients known to be colonized with MRSA or considered at high risk, we suggest vancomycin or teicoplanin, where available, or linezolid or daptomycin as alternatives (Grade 2-B). Notably, there are no published studies specifically evaluating antimicrobial therapy for IAI related to MRSA.

Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) infections have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

Many factors can increase the risk of colonization with VRE. These include previous antibiotic therapy (the number and duration of antibiotics received) prolonged hospitalization, hospitalization in an intensive care unit severity of illness, invasive procedures and devices, gastrointestinal surgery, transplantation, proximity to another VRE-positive patient.

Affected patients usually have multiple and relevant co-morbidities, with prolonged hospital stay and received long courses of broad spectrum antibiotics.

In the survey of Montravers and coworkers no differences in frequency of isolation of Candida spp were identified in community or hospital acquired IAIs, and the overall prevalence was under 5%, in contrast with other observations, especially those related to patients with recurrent gastrointestinal perforation/anastomotic leakage.

Although the epidemiological role of Candida spp in nosocomial peritonitis is not yet defined, the clinical role is significant, because Candidal isolation is normally associated to a poor prognosis.

The same study group on 2006 published an elegant retrospective, case-control study conducted in critically ill patients admitted to 17 French ICUs where the yielding of Candida spp from peritoneal specimen was a variable independently associated to mortality in the setting of nosocomial peritonitis.

More recently Montravers and coll. reported a mortality rate of 38% in a prospective cohort of 93 patients admitted to ICU with candidal peritonitis.

Therefore, like for Enterococci, the inclusion of an anticandidal drug in the empiric regimen of severe nosocomial acquired IAIs, seems appropriate as confirmed by IDSA guidelines.

The recently published IDSA guidelines for the treatment of invasive candidiasis don't comprise a chapter specifically dedicated to candidal peritonitis. However the expert panels generically favor the use of echinocandins as first line empirical therapy in severely ill patients, recommending fluconazole for less severe conditions.

Therefore, transferring this concept to the context of IAIs we might advise the proscription of echinocandins as first line treatment in severe nosocomial IAIs. The IDSA guidelines also recommend the transition from an echinocandin to fluconazole for patients clinically stable and who have isolates of Candida spp susceptible to fluconazole; so the final recommendation would be to start with an echinocandin and to de-escalate to fluconazole as soon as possible on a clinical or microbiological basis.

In appendices 9,10 are summarized the antimicrobial regimens for hospital-acquired intra-abdominal infections, recommended by WSES consensus conference.

SIS guidelines on intra-abdominal infection — renal impairment dosing principles state that most antimicrobial agents do not require dosage adjustments until the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreases below 60 mL/min, that the initial dosage of most antimicrobial agents should not be altered in patients with impaired renal function, and that subsequent dosing is typically adjusted according to eGFR; dosing adjustments can be expedited using therapeutic drug monitoring, for which commercial assays are commonly available for vancomycin and aminoglycosides, and therapeutic drug monitoring may be particularly valuable when GFR fluctuates during therapy.

### The management of intra-abdominal infections from a global perspective: 2017 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^115hGBDS]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Resistant flora may include the non-fermenting gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa, very dangerous either in the abdominal cavity, or in hepatobiliary surgery and Acinetobacter spp, ESBL-producing K. pneumonia, E. coli and vancomycin -resistant enterococci (VRE).

During the last two decades, antimicrobial resistance has become a global threat to public health systems and some of the most common causes include erroneous use of antibiotics, and poor prevention and control with respect to infections. Particularly, infections caused by resistant gram-negative bacteria are becoming increasingly prevalent and now constitute a serious threat to public health worldwide because they are difficult to treat and are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Bacteria producing carbapenemases, such as K. pneumonia, are rapidly emerging as a major source of multidrug-resistant infections worldwide and pose a serious threat in clinical situations where administration of effective empiric antibiotics is essential to prevent mortality following bacteraemia and infections in immunocompromised patients. Non-fermenting gram-negative bacteria (P. aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Acinetobacter baumannii) have exhibited alarming rates of increased resistance to a variety of antibiotics in health facilities worldwide. Both species are intrinsically resistant to several drugs and could acquire additional resistance to other important antimicrobial agents. P. aeruginosa coverage is only generally recommended for patients with HA-IAIs.

Among gram-positive bacteria, enterococci play a significant role in IAI. Some studies have demonstrated poor outcomes among patients with documented enterococcal infections, particularly in those with post-operative IAI where enterococci coverage should be always considered.

The acquisition of glycopeptide resistance by enterococci has seriously affected the treatment and control of these organisms. Affected patients usually have multiple and relevant co-morbidities, with prolonged hospital stay and received long courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The burden of multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) infections in LMICs is difficult to quantify because in these countries, routine microbiologic culture and sensitivity testing, especially in rural hospitals, are not performed because of the lack of personnel, equipment, and financial resources. As a consequence, antimicrobial therapy is empirical and a small collection of antimicrobials may be overused. This approach, although relatively inexpensive, may increase the emergence of antimicrobial resistance and hence sub-optimal clinical outcomes.

Aztreonam-based regimen — use with metronidazole and vancomycin is conditional and reserved: Consider use of aztreonam plus metronidazole plus vancomycin as an option for empiric therapy of adults and children (Grade 2-B), but reserve this regimen primarily for higher-risk patients, particularly those with serious β-lactam allergies, because of its broader-spectrum activity (Grade 2-C).

Selection of empiric antimicrobial therapy for adult patients with HA-IAI: Because patients with HA-IAI are at risk for infection from resistant organisms, additional antimicrobial agents may lessen the risk of inadequate initial therapy and subsequent treatment failure. Assess patients with respect to their separate risks of infection from Enterococcus spp. MRSA, resistant gram-negative bacilli, and Candida spp. (Grade 2-B), and use the broader-spectrum agents recommended for higher-risk patients with CA-IAI for initial empiric therapy of patients with HA-IAI, with consideration of other empiric agents based on the patient's risk for these pathogens (Grade 2-B). For anti-enterococcal therapy, identify patients with HA-IAI who have post-operative infections, recent exposure to broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, signs of severe sepsis or septic shock, or known to be colonized with VRE as at risk for infection with Enterococcus spp. (Grade 2-B), and consider use of vancomycin or teicoplanin for empiric therapy and linezolid or daptomycin for patients known to be colonized or at high risk for infection with VRE (Grade 2-B). For anti-staphylococcal therapy, identify patients with multiple healthcare-associated risk factors for MRSA colonization or known to be colonized with MRSA as at risk (Grade 2-B), and consider use of vancomycin or teicoplanin, where available, or linezolid or daptomycin as alternatives (Grade 2-B). For resistant gram-negative organisms, identify patients with substantial previous broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, prolonged hospitalizations, multiple invasive interventions, or known colonization or infection as at risk (Grade 2-B), consult local epidemiologic data and antibiograms (Grade 2-B), and consider use of a broad-spectrum carbapenem, or ceftolozane-tazobactam or ceftazidime-avibactam as alternatives for patients at risk for infection with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae (Grade 2-B).

Intra-abdominal infection (IAI) empiric therapy in higher-risk patients — this guideline recommends use of empiric anti-enterococcal and antifungal therapy in many such patients and recommends empiric agents with broader-spectrum activity against gram-negative pathogens. It cautions that overuse of broad-spectrum agents may lead to even greater resistance problems. It further states that whether broader-spectrum empiric therapy (including anti-enterococcal, anti-MRSA, and antifungal agents) improves outcomes in severely ill patients should be evaluated prospectively, and that RCTs of new agents active against resistant microorganisms should include adequate numbers of severely ill patients.

Surgical Infection Society intra-abdominal infection guideline — methods and evidence grading state that an additional comprehensive Medline search identified studies published between 2014 and early 2016, with selected publications from before 2000 added as needed, resulting in a final database that included 778 articles identified during the primary screening process, 565 identified via secondary and supplementary searches, and 89 identified in the final search of the most recent time period. The database was screened for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) related to antimicrobial treatment of intra-abdominal infection published between 2000 and 2016; data from RCTs were available for only a small fraction of questions, and working groups were obligated to use the data from all relevant RCTs. Evidence was evaluated according to GRADE criteria for precision, directness, consistency, and risk of bias, but formal GRADE tables were not prepared, and GRADE criteria of quality of evidence, balance between desirable and undesirable effects, values and preferences, and resource allocation were used, emphasizing the first two criteria, with recommendations refined until a final consensus was achieved.

Statement 31

Antimicrobial resistance among enterococcal isolates (ampicillin, gentamcin or vancomycin resistance) is mostly found in nosocomial (postoperative or tertiary) peritonitis. In Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), treatment with linezolid (monomicrobial infection) or tigecycline (polymicrobial infection) is appropriate (Recommendation 1 B).

Among Gram-positive bacteria, Enterococci play a significant role in IAIs. Although they are found in community-acquired infections, they were far more prevalent in hospital-acquired infections. In the CIAOW Study, Enterococci (E. faecalis and E. faecium) were the most prevalent bacteria among all the aerobic Gram-positive bacteria isolated in the intra-operative samples, representing 15.9% of all aerobic isolates. Although Enterococci were also present in community-acquired infections, they were more prevalent in HA-IAIs (22.3% in HA-IAIs versus 13.9% in CA-IAIs). Some studies have demonstrated poor outcomes among patients with documented enterococcal infections, particularly in those with post-operative IAIs where Enterococci coverage should always be considered. Empirical coverage of Enterococci is not generally recommended for patients with CA-IAIs. The acquisition of glycopeptide resistance by enterococci has seriously affected the treatment and control of these organisms. Many factors can increase the risk of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) infection. These include previous antibiotic therapy, prolonged hospitalization, hospitalization in an intensive care unit, severe illness or underlying pathology, invasive procedures, gastrointestinal surgery, organ transplantation, and close proximity to other VRE-positive patients.

The majority of vancomicyn-resistant enterococcus infections have been attributed to E. faecium, though glycopeptide resistance occurs in E. faecalis and other Enterococcus spp. as well.

Options for treating vancomicyn-resistant enterococcus infections are linezolid or tigeciclyine.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^1165Vx3f]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

SIS guidelines on intra-abdominal infection — empiric therapy for higher-risk community-acquired intra-abdominal infection (CA-IAI) emphasizes broad-spectrum coverage and selective antifungal use. We suggest treatment of CA-IAI in higher-risk patients with broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial agents to ensure coverage of less common gram-negative pathogens potentially involved in these infections (Grade 2-C). Preferred agents are piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem-cilastatin, meropenem, doripenem, or cefepime plus metronidazole (Grade 2-A), with ceftriaxone plus metronidazole as an alternative regimen (Grade 2-B); for patients with a severe reaction to β-lactam agents, we suggest aztreonam plus metronidazole plus vancomycin (Grade 2-B). We do not recommend addition of an adjunctive aminoglycoside or fluoroquinolone to a β-lactam agent for empiric management of CA-IAI in higher-risk patients (Grade 1-B). Regarding antifungal therapy, we do not recommend routine addition of empiric antifungal therapy for management of CA-IAI in higher-risk patients (Grade 1-B), but we suggest empiric use of antifungal therapy for management of CA-IAI in critically ill patients with an upper gastrointestinal source (Grade 2-B), aligning with the note that empiric antifungal therapy be considered for critically ill patients with CA-IAI because of upper gastrointestinal perforations.

Higher-risk CA-IAI — empiric anti-enterococcal coverage: The task force concluded that there is rationale for providing empiric anti-enterococcal coverage in seriously ill patients with CA-IAI; based on these data, the task force judged piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin-sulbactam, and the regimen of aztreonam, metronidazole, and vancomycin as adequate for empiric treatment of Enterococcus spp. in higher-risk patients with CA-IAI; with use of other broad-spectrum carbapenems, addition of ampicillin or vancomycin could be considered; supplemental ampicillin or vancomycin for coverage of E. faecalis should be added routinely to combinations of cefepime or ceftazidime with metronidazole, because these regimens lack anti-enterococcal coverage; routine therapy directed against E. faecium was not considered necessary for higher-risk patients with CA-IAI, but if there were a high suspicion that this organism was a component of the infecting flora, supplemental vancomycin should be used.

Surgical Infection Society (SIS) intra-abdominal infection guideline — 2024 update methods and scope state that SIS previously issued evidence-based guidelines in 1992, 2002, 2010, and 2017. The update was based on a systematic review using PubMed/Medline, the Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science from 2016 until February 2024; Keywords/descriptors combined "surgical site infections" or "intra-abdominal infections" in adults limited to randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses, and additional relevant publications identified during literature review were included. Recommendations were graded with the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) system, with strength rated strong (1) or weak (2) and quality rated high (A), moderate (B), or weak (C). The guideline contains new recommendations and updates to recommendations from previous 14 guideline versions, with final recommendations developed by an iterative process and all writing group members voting to accept or reject each recommendation. The updated evidence-based guideline provides recommendations for the treatment of adult patients with IAI, including antimicrobial agent selection, timing, route of administration, duration, and de-escalation; timing of source control; and treatment of specific pathogens.

Aztreonam-based empiric regimen for intra-abdominal infection (IAI) — We suggest that the regimen of aztreonam plus metronidazole plus vancomycin is acceptable for the empiric treatment of adult and children older than one month with IAI (Grade 2-B). We suggest this regimen be reserved primarily for higher-risk patients, because of its broad-spectrum activity against gram-negative pathogens (Grade 2-C). For coverage, aztreonam should be combined with metronidazole and with an agent that has activity against aerobic gram-positive cocci, such as vancomycin.

Multidrug-resistant pathogens

The threat of antimicrobial resistance has been identified as one of the major challenges in the management of complicated intra-abdominal infections.

Over the past few decades, an increase of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus species, carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter spp. has been observed, also in intra-abdominal infections.

Management of severe intra-abdominal infections must always include a balance between optimizing empirical therapy, which has been shown to improve outcomes, and reducing unnecessary antimicrobial use. Bacterial resistance is becoming a very important problem. Despite increasing antimicrobial resistance and multi-drug resistance in clinical isolates, there are few novel antimicrobial agents in development. Some broad-spectrum agents maintain still satisfactory profiles of safety and efficacy in treatment of multidrug resistant bacteria in complicated intra-abdominal infections but they must be used judiciously to preserve their effectiveness against multidrug resistant pathogens.

Enterococcus

Enterococcus infections are difficult to treat because of both intrinsic and acquired resistance to many antibiotics.

Enterococci are intrinsically resistant to many penicillins, and all cephalosporins with the possible exception of ceftobiprole and ceftaroline, currently undergoing clinical evaluation. Besides Enterococci have acquired resistance to many other classes of antibiotics, to which the organisms are not intrinsically resistant, including fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and penicillins. Many strains of E. faecalis are susceptible to certain penicillins, carbapenems, and fluoroquinolones; however, virtually all strains of E. faecium are resistant to these agents.

Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) infections have bee associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Resistance of Enterococci to vancomycin was reported in Europe in 1986 and the prevalence of infections related to VRE has continued to increase annually.

### 2013 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^115h3vWU]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Cultures should be taken from intra-abdominal samples during surgical or interventional drainage procedures. Surgeons must ensure sufficient volume (a minimum of 1 mL of fluid or tissue) before sending the samples to a clinical laboratory by means of a transport system that properly handles the samples so as not to damage them or compromise their integrity.

The empirically designed antimicrobial regimen depends on the underlying severity of infection, the pathogens presumed to be involved, and the risk factors indicative of major resistance patterns (Recommendation 1B).

Predicting the pathogens and potential resistance patterns of a given infection begins by establishing whether the infection is community-acquired or healthcare-associated (nosocomial).

The major pathogens involved in community-acquired intra-abdominal infections are Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus species, and anaerobes (especially B. fragilis).

Contrastingly, the spectrum of microorganisms involved in nosocomial infections is significantly broader. In the past 20 years, the incidence of healthcare-associated infections caused by drug-resistant microorganisms has risen dramatically, probably in correlation with escalating levels of antibiotic exposure and increasing frequency of patients with one or more predisposing conditions, including elevated severity of illness, advanced age, degree of organ dysfunction, low albumin levels, poor nutritional status, immunodepression, presence of malignancy, and other comorbidities.

Although the transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms is most frequently observed in acute care facilities, all healthcare settings are affected by the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens.

In past decades, an increased prevalence of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus species, carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species, multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter species, and Candida species has been observed, particularly in cases of intra-abdominal infection.

Community-acquired intra-abdominal infection (CA-IAI) — higher-risk patients: Treat higher-risk patients with broader-spectrum empiric antimicrobial agents to ensure coverage of less common gram-negative pathogens potentially involved in these infections (Grade 2-C). Use piperacillin-tazobactam, doripenem, imipenem-cilastatin, meropenem, or cefepime plus metronidazole as the preferred agents for initial empiric therapy of higher-risk patients (Grade 2-A), and consider use of ceftazidime plus metronidazole as an alternative regimen (Grade 2-B) or aztreonam plus metronidazole plus vancomycin for those with a severe reaction to β-lactam agents (Grade 2-B). Do not add an adjunctive aminoglycoside or fluoroquinolone to a β-lactam agent for empiric treatment of higher-risk patients (Grade 1-B), consider use of added ampicillin or vancomycin for empiric anti-enterococcal treatment if the patient is not being treated with piperacillin-tazobactam or imipenem-cilastatin (Grade 2-B), and do not use antifungal agents routinely for empiric therapy of higher-risk patients (Grade 1-B) but consider use for critically ill patients with an upper gastrointestinal source (Grade 2-B).

### Improving empiric antibiotic selection for patients hospitalized with abdominal infection: the INSPIRE 4 cluster randomized clinical trial [^111V8vhK]. JAMA Surgery (2025). High credibility.

The study INSPIRE 4 was published by Shruti K Gohil and colleagues in 2025 in the journal JAMA Surg. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute appendicitis, Acute cholecystitis, Acute cholangitis, Acute diverticulitis and Intra-abdominal abscess. In the INSPIRE 4 study, the trial question was: what is the role of computerized provider order entry stewardship bundle in noncritically ill patients hospitalized with abdominal infection? In the INSPIRE 4 study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the INSPIRE 4 study, the population was: 105004 patients (62101 female, 42903 male). The inclusion criteria were noncritically ill patients hospitalized with abdominal infection. The key exclusion criteria were age < 18 years; ordered to receive extended-spectrum antibiotics for abdominal infection. In the INSPIRE 4 study, the interventions were: n = 50620 CPOE stewardship bundle (computerized patient order entry prompts recommending standard-spectrum antibiotics coupled with clinician education and feedback) n = 54384 routine stewardship (educational materials and quarterly coaching calls to maintain stewardship activities per national guidelines). In the INSPIRE 4 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in extended-spectrum days of therapy (169.3 days per 1,000 empiric days vs. 19.8 days per 1000 empiric days; RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.4 to 1.66). In the INSPIRE 4 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in reduction in vancomycin days of therapy (29.7 days per 1,000 empiric days vs. 11.8 days per 1000 empiric days; RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.37) Significant increase in reduction in antipseudomonal days of therapy (131.8 days per 1,000 empiric days vs. 5.6 days per 1000 empiric days; RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.49 to 1.78). In the INSPIRE 4 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in length of stay, days to ICU transfers. In the INSPIRE 4 study, the conclusion was: in noncritically ill patients hospitalized with abdominal infection, CPOE stewardship bundle was superior to routine stewardship with respect to reduction in extended-spectrum days of therapy.

But the greater significance of the use of tigecycline in empirical antibiotic regimens for IAIs is related to the possibility of saving carbapenems prescriptions. From an epidemiological point of view tigecycline should be a qualified therapeutic option in a carbapenems-sparing stewardship programs, as extended-spectrum b-lactamases become widely disseminated among the endogenous gut Enterobacteriaceae.

Distinguishing antimicrobial regimens according to the clinical patient's severity, the presumed pathogens and risk factors for major resistance patterns, the presumed/identified source of infection it is possible to standardize the empirical approach to the main clinical condition related to IAIs.

In appendices 1, 2, 3, 4 are summarized the antimicrobial regimens for extrabiliary community-acquired IAIs, recommended by WSES consensus conference.

Since the causative pathogens and the related resistance patterns can not easily be predicted (higher-risk patients), cultures from the site of infection must be always obtained (Recommendation 1 B).

Although the absence of impact of bacteriological cultures has been documented, especially in appendicitis, in this era of the broad spread of resistant microorganisms such as nosocomial and community extended-spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenemase producing gram negatives, b lactam- and vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE), the threat of resistance is a source of major concern for clinicians. Therefore the results of the microbiological analyses have great importance for the therapeutic strategy of every patient, in particular in the adaptation of the initial antibiotic treatment, and at the same time are of paramount importance to ensure adequacy of empirical antimicrobial treatment.

The habit of considering the microbiological diagnosis useless is probably responsible for the relative scarcity of microbiological data and the variability of results of the few studies appropriate to emphasize the changes in resistance in IAI patients.

Cultures should be performed at least from intra-abdominal samples from surgery or interventional drainage procedures, providing sufficient volume (at least 1 mL of fluid or tissue, preferably more) and sending them to the laboratory using an appropriate transport system.

Intra-abdominal infection (IAI) — scope and management priorities are outlined by excluding certain abdominal conditions, stating that management generally involves expeditious diagnosis, initial resuscitation, source control, and antimicrobial therapy, with source control defined as mechanical techniques aimed at decreasing the bacterial inoculum and allowing host defenses to control infection; the task force focuses on these aspects. Initial evidence-based treatment is frequently successful but fails in approximately 20% of patients, and such patients are at increased risk for further adverse outcomes. Decisions should be individualized while considering the risk of inadequate therapy and system-level impacts, recognizing that widespread use of expensive modalities may limit other therapies and that overuse of antimicrobial resources leads to resistance; accordingly, the principles of antimicrobial stewardship are stressed.

### Complicated intra-abdominal infections in Europe: preliminary data from the first three months of the CIAO study [^116BCgzU]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) include a wide spectrum of pathological conditions, ranging from uncomplicated appendicitis to fecal peritonitis.

From a clinical perspective, IAIs are classified in two major categories: complicated and uncomplicated.

In the event of a complicated IAI, the infectious process proceeds beyond a singularly affected organ and causes either localized peritonitis (intra-abdominal abscesses) or diffuse peritonitis. Effectively treating patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections involves both source control and antibiotic therapy.

Source control is a broad term encompassing all measures undertaken to eliminate the source of infection and control ongoing contamination.

The most common source of infection in community-acquired intra-abdominal infections is the appendix, followed by the colon, and then the stomach. Dehiscence complicates 5–10% of intra-abdominal bowel anastomoses and is associated with an increased mortality rate.

Antimicrobial therapy plays an integral role in the management of intra-abdominal infections; empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated as early as possible.

Bacterial antibiotic resistance has become a very prevalent problem in treating intra-abdominal infections, yet despite this elevated resistance, the pharmaceutical industry has surprisingly few new antimicrobial agents currently in development.

In the last decade, the increased emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, has foreshadowed a troubling trend and become an issue of key concern in the medical community regarding the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

In the specific context of intra-abdominal infections, ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae pose the greatest resistance-related problem. Today these pathological microorganisms are frequently found in both nosocomial and community-acquired IAIs.

The recent and rapid spread of serine carbapenemases in Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC) has become an important issue concerning antimicrobial therapy in hospitals worldwide and is of primary importance in properly optimizing the use of carbapenems based on a patient's indication and exposure criteria.

### Uncertain benefits of oral vancomycin for recurrent C. difficile infection… [^1156ahKu]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

They chose the regimen recommended by the American College of Gastroenterology guidelines. 3 Most of the prior studies dosed the vancomycin differently, with 1 study using a higher dose of 250 mg twice daily. 4 They used 2-step testing, using culture with the final diagnosis made by enzyme-linked immunoassay for both toxins A and B. If the enzyme-linked immunoassay was negative, stool was sent out for cell cytotoxicity. Positive stool cultures were tested by polymerase chain reaction, which was used to confirm the presence of the toxin B gene. The study demonstrated the benefit of daily vancomycin with a 13. 5% decrease in recurrences. 2 Although it did not reach statistical significance because the study was underpowered, the reduction appears to be a clinically meaningful result. The secondary outcome was rates of VRE carriage.

2 The rates of carriage were higher in the placebo group by rectal swab at the time of enrollment, but not significantly different. After vancomycin treatment, the rate of VRE colonization did not change in the vancomycin group but declined in the placebo group. After treatment, the vancomycin group had more VRE colonization. In addition, patients with obesity treated with vancomycin had reduction of the conversion of primary to secondary bile acids. 5 Primary bile acids are associated with promotion of C difficile spore germination and growth, which may ultimately set up the patient for more recurrences.

There are 3 treatment guidelines for management of CDI: the American College of Gastroenterology guideline, 3 which conditionally recommends vancomycin use; The European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases guideline, 6 which does not recommend routine prophylaxis but states that it may be useful in select patients; and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guideline, 7 which found insufficient evidence to recommend use of vancomycin. The current study2 supports the use of vancomycin prophylaxis for prevention of rCDI in patients receiving antibacterial treatment for alternative indications within 180 days of the CDI episode. The small sample size limits the ability to provide conclusive evidence of efficacy. A large multicenter, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial will be necessary to answer this question definitively.

It will also provide more evidence of the effects on the gut microbiota and allow clinicians to weigh the risks and benefits of vancomycin prophylaxis.

### Intra-abdominal infections survival guide: a position statement by the global alliance for infections in surgery [^114EjZiS]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Alarming rates of resistance have been described for non-fermenting gram-negative bacteria, including P. aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Acinetobacter baumanniii complex. These difficult-to-treat MDR bacteria are intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics, but also can acquire resistance to most classes of antibiotic agents. Multiple mechanisms may be present simultaneously, conferring resistance to several classes of antibiotics, including membrane permeability defects, expression of efflux pumps, and production of antibiotic-hydrolysing enzymes such as AmpC beta-lactamases or carbapenemases. S. maltophilia and A. baumanniii complex are rare cIAI pathogens, but can cause postoperative pneumonia among high-risk critically ill patients with cIAI.

Among gram-positive bacteria, Enterococcus spp. is associated with increased morbidity in IAIs, but the effect on mortality is uncertain. Whereas the role of enterococci in high-risk patients is well documented, their role in cIAIs in low-risk patients is doubtful. Zhang et al. found by meta-analysis that anti-enterococcal regimens provide no improvement in cIAI treatment success, with similar mortality and adverse effects, in RCTs enrolling young patients with lower-risk community-acquired infections (median APACHE-II score, 6 points). Malignant disease, corticosteroid use, surgery, any antibiotic treatment, admission to an ICU, and an indwelling urinary catheter each predisposed patients with cIAI to a higher risk of enterococcal infection. The prevalence of enterococcal isolation was 2- to 5-fold higher from hospital-acquired IAIs.

Empiric anti-enterococcal therapy for cIAI is not necessary for most community-acquired infections, but is indicated in hospital-acquired IAIs and may be considered for immunocompromised patients, critically ill patients with sepsis and previous antimicrobial therapy lacking enterococcal coverage, or patients with valvular heart disease or intravascular prosthetics at high risk for endocarditis or blood-borne device-associated infection. The ideal regimen for high-risk patients is undetermined. E. faecalis is generally susceptible to ampicillin whereas E. faecium, encountered increasingly, is almost always ampicillin-resistant and 70% of strains are resistant to vancomycin. The first-line treatment of glycopeptide-susceptible E. faecium is vancomycin. Linezolid or daptomycin may be used to treat vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, but occasional resistance has been reported to both agents. The glyclcyclines also have useful activity against vancomycin-resistant E. faecium.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the Italian council for the optimization of antimicrobial use [^113rk6F2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Aztreonam-avibactam is currently under clinical development for the treatment of serious infections caused by MBLs-producing Enterobacterales.

Alarming rates of resistance to many antibiotics in hospitals worldwide have been reported for non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Acinetobcter baumannii. These bacteria are intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics; moreover, they can acquire additional resistance to other important antibiotic agents.

Among Gram-positive bacteria involved in IAIs, the impact of Enterococcus spp. on mortality remains uncertain. While the role of Enterococci spp. in determining breakthroughs or superinfections in high-risk patients is well documented, their pathogenic impact on IAIs in low-risk patients is still debated. As far as Enterococcus spp. is believed to possess low virulence factors, it may be supposed that an increase in virulence may be obtained by the development of a synergistic effect with other bacteria like E. coli and anaerobes. Various observational studies highlighted the treatment failure of patients infected by Enterococcus spp. relates with a poorer outcome; however, there is no consistent evidence that routine use of adequate anti-enterococcal coverage improves the survival rate, hypothesizing that Enterococcus spp. isolation represents a negative prognostic marker rather than playing a causative role in the infection. In their meta-analysis, Zhang et al. found that enterococci-covered antibiotic regimens provided no improvement in treatment success compared with control regimens (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.00; p = 0.15), with similar mortality and adverse effects in both arms. Basic characteristic analysis revealed that most of the enrolled patients with IAIs in RCTs were young, lower-risk CA-IAIs patients with a relatively low APACHE II score. Interestingly, malignancy, corticosteroid use, surgical intervention, antibiotic treatment, admission to the ICU, and indwelling urinary catheters could predispose patients with IAI to a substantially higher risk of enterococcal infection. Also, the acquisition of an IAI in the hospital setting seemed to represent a risk factor for enterococcal infections (OR, 2.81; 95% CI, 2.34–3.39; p < 0.001). In Dupont et al. study, patients older than 75 years and admitted to ICU with Enterococcus spp. isolation presented higher SAPS2 and SOFA scores when compared with the enterococci -negative control group (p < 0.001 for both scores), confirming that the identification of these bacteria represents an independent risk factor for ICU mortality. Similarly, in Morvan et al. study ICU patients had higher 30-day mortality when Enterococcus spp. was isolated, especially when species other than Enterococcus faecalis (mostly E. faecium) or a polymicrobial infection were detected. Accordingly, to the above-described evidence, Sanders et al. concluded that the only parameter able to predict Enterococcus spp. isolation was the APACHE-II score (unadjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.07; p < 0.01). In Fabre et al. multicentre study where approximately 65% of patients in both groups had CA-IAIs, there was no difference in the 30-day composite outcome between cIAI patients with E. faecalis isolation from intra-abdominal cultures and those treated with piperacillin/tazobactam rather than receiving ertapenem therapy (which cannot guarantee an adequate anti-enterococcal coverage) (OR 0.80; 95% CI; 0.39–1.63).

### A focus on intra-abdominal infections [^114H9ZkD]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Complicated intra-abdominal infections are an important cause of morbidity and are frequently associated with poor prognosis, particularly in higher risk patients. Well defined evidence-based recommendations for intra-abdominal infections treatment are partially lacking because of the limited number of randomized-controlled trials. Factors consistently associated with poor outcomes in patients with intra-abdominal infections include increased illness severity, failed source control, inadequate empiric antimicrobial therapy and healthcare-acquired infection. Early prognostic evaluation of complicated intra-abdominal infections is important to select high-risk patients for more aggressive therapeutic procedures. The cornerstones in the management of complicated intra-abdominal infections are both source control and antibiotic therapy. The timing and the adequacy of source control are the most important issues in the management of intra-abdominal infections, because inadequate and late control of septic source may have a negative effect on the outcomes. Recent advances in interventional and more aggressive techniques could significantly decrease the morbidity and mortality of physiologically severe complicated intra-abdominal infections, even if these are still being debated and are yet not validated by limited prospective trials. Empiric antimicrobial therapy is nevertheless important in the overall management of intra-abdominal infections. Inappropriate antibiotic therapy may result in poor patient outcomes and in the appearance of bacterial resistance. Antimicrobial management is generally standardised and many regimens, either with monotherapy or combination therapy, have proven their efficacy. Routine coverage especially against Enterococci and candida spp is not always recommended, but can be useful in particular clinical conditions. A de escalation approach may be recommended in patients with specific risk factors for multidrug resistant infections such as immunodeficiency and prolonged antibacterial exposure. Therapy should focus on the obtainment of adequate source control and adequate use of antimicrobial therapy dictated by individual patient risk factors. Other critical issues remain debated and more controversies are still open mainly because of the limited number of randomized controlled trials.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the WSES 2016 consensus conference [^1128YYx6]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Recently, Montravers et al. demonstrated that de-escalation is a feasible option in patients with polymicrobial infections such as healthcare-associated IAIs. In a context of a dedicated "antibiotic stewardship" program, de-escalation should be encouraged, whenever possible, to optimize antibiotic use.

Emphasis on MDRO epidemiology is needed to better understand current strategies of prevention and management of critically ill patients in ICUs.

A rational use of antibiotics is important in order to prevent the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria, especially in ICUs. In critically ill patients, positive cultures may actually represent contamination. Antibiotic stewardship for critically ill patients may be translated into the implementation of specific guidelines, which were largely promoted by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, targeted to optimizing choice, dosage, and duration of antibiotics in order to improve outcomes and reduce the development of resistance.

### Intraabdominal vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus infections: the new threat [^114JJXcN]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Goals

To determine the clinical course and outcome in patients with intraabdominal vancomycin-resistant enterococcus infections (VRE-A) and to identify probable risk factors for VRE-A.

Background

Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus is one of the most notable nosocomial emerging pathogens. The incidence is increasing, especially in the abdominal surgery setting.

Study

A comparative study of patients with VRE-A and VRE infection in other sites (VRE-O) who were hospitalized for over 1 year. Fisher exact test and Student t test were used; a two-tailed p value of less than 0.05 was considered to be significant.

Results

Of 89 nine patients with VRE, six had VRE-A, 24 had VRE-O, and 59 had VRE colonization. The VRE-A group was comprised of one patient with an inoperable Klatskin tumor and biliary sepsis, one with acquired immune deficiency syndrome and an infected pancreatic pseudocyst, two with fecal peritonitis, and two with biliary sepsis after surgery for common bile duct stones. All six patients with VRE-A had recent surgery before VRE isolation, as compared with three in the VRE-O group (p = 0.0001). Despite adequate treatment with intravenous chloramphenicol, resulting in eradication of VRE in all six VRE-A cases, the mortality rate remained high at 50%.

Conclusions

Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus should be recognized as an emerging nosocomial pathogen that causes potentially fatal intraabdominal infections in the postsurgical setting. However, the impact of treatment on ultimate outcome needs further evaluation.

### Intra-abdominal infections survival guide: a position statement by the global alliance for infections in surgery [^1159p5qd]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in hospital settings worldwide. The cornerstones of IAI management include rapid, accurate diagnostics; timely, adequate source control; appropriate, short-duration antimicrobial therapy administered according to the principles of pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and antimicrobial stewardship; and hemodynamic and organ functional support with intravenous fluid and adjunctive vasopressor agents for critical illness (sepsis/organ dysfunction or septic shock after correction of hypovolemia). In patients with IAIs, a personalized approach is crucial to optimize outcomes and should be based on multiple aspects that require careful clinical assessment. The anatomic extent of infection, the presumed pathogens involved and risk factors for antimicrobial resistance, the origin and extent of the infection, the patient's clinical condition, and the host's immune status should be assessed continuously to optimize the management of patients with complicated IAIs.

Clinical patient's severity

This choice of the antimicrobial regimen poses serious problems for the management of critically ill patients. In patients with severe sepsis or septic shock an early correct empirical antimicrobial therapy has a significant impact on the outcome, independently by the site of infection.

This data confirm the results of Riché and coll. who demonstrated, in a prospective observational study involving 180 consecutive patients with secondary generalized peritonitis, a significantly higher mortality rate in septic shock (35 versus 8% for patients without shock).

Recent international guidelines for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock (Surviving Sepsis Campaign) recommend intravenous antibiotics within the first hour after severe sepsis and septic shock are recognized, use of broad-spectrum agents with good penetration into the presumed site of infection, and reassessment of the antimicrobial regimen daily to optimize efficacy, prevent resistance, avoid toxicity and minimize costs. Full adherence to these recommendations requires that clinicians, in order to optimize antibiotic therapy in critically ill patients, be aware that it is not sufficient to make the correct choice on the basis of the anti-biogram or of a correct epidemiological evaluation of risk factor for microorganisms and resistance patterns, but it is also mandatory to implement timely administration of the right dose on the right schedule, according to the pathophysiological and immunological status of the patient and to the pharmacokinetics properties of the chosen drugs.

This concept is correct not only from a clinical point of view; in fact sub-optimal plasma levels of antimicrobials and/or suboptimal exposure to antimicrobials in the infection site represent the best condition to favor the emergence of resistant strains, with a consequent higher probability of therapeutic failure and increased human and social costs.

For example, in critically ill patients, higher-than-standard loading doses of b-lactams, aminoglycosides or glycopeptides should be administered to ensure optimal exposure at the infection site independently of the patient's renal function.

For lipophilic antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines, the 'dilution effect' in the extracellular fluids during severe sepsis may be mitigated by the rapid redistribution of the drug from the intracellular compartment to the interstitium. In contrast to what happens with hydrophilic antimicrobials, standard dosages of lipophilic antimicrobials may frequently ensure adequate loading even in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.

Intra-abdominal infection (IAI) empiric regimen strategy — To provide adequate antimicrobial therapy to higher-risk patients, use of broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial regimens is recommended, and to avoid excessive exposure and selection of further resistant microorganisms, de-escalation of therapy based on culture results is also recommended. Culture and susceptibility results can be used to guide pathogen-directed therapy when an unexpected or resistant pathogen is encountered; even though such therapy may be delayed, it is still more likely to be successful than continued administration of an inappropriate empiric regimen. There have been substantial increases in resistance of microbial pathogens involved in IAI to previously effective antimicrobial agents, particularly in Asia and Latin America.

### Oral vancomycin for prevention of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection… [^111erHQU]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Meaning Other interventions should be investigated for their effectiveness in preventing CDI recurrence after non–CDI-indicated antibiotic therapy. Importance Systemic antibiotic use for patients with a non–Clostridioides difficile infection is a major risk factor for recurrent CDI. Increasing use of oral vancomycin for secondary prophylaxis against recurrent CDI in this context has uncertain efficacy. Intervention Participants were randomized 1: 1 to 125 mg of oral vancomycin or placebo once daily during antibiotic use for a non-CDI plus 5 days following cessation of those antibiotics. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was recurrent CDI incidence during treatment and the 8-week follow-up period. The secondary outcome was vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus carriage in stool.

We conducted a prospective randomized clinical trial to assess the effect of oral vancomycin prophylaxis on recurrent CDI incidence and VRE carriage of the gut in patients with a recent CDI who were taking systemic antibiotics for a non-CDI indication. This study aimed to evaluate whether a low dose of oral vancomycin administered during and immediately following non–CDI-indicated antibiotic treatment was effective in preventing recurrent CDI. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial, patients who had CDI in the previous 180 days who took 125 mg of prophylactic oral vancomycin during and for 5 days after a course of non–CDI-indicated antibiotic therapy had lower rates of recurrent CDI than patients taking a placebo; however, this study was underpowered to find a statistically significant difference.

Oral vancomycin prophylaxis during non–CDI-indicated systemic antibiotic therapy has been conditionally recommended for patients at high risk of CDI recurrence by the American College of Gastroenterology, which notes that this recommendation is supported by low-quality evidence and that there is a need for prospective clinical trials. In this randomized clinical trial, among patients with a recent CDI and taking a subsequent non–CDI-indicated antibiotic course, patients taking oral vancomycin had reduced rates of recurrent CDI compared with patients taking a placebo. However, our study was underpowered to identify a statistically significant difference.

There was a marginal but significant difference in VRE carriage in stool samples at 8 weeks after treatment between patients taking oral vancomycin and patients taking a placebo; however, participants taking placebo had a decrease in VRE carriage after completing treatment that was not observed in participants taking oral vancomycin.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the WSES 2016 consensus conference [^111734md]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Which interventions improve antibiotic prescribing practices for patients with IAIs?

Interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing practices for patients with IAIs should be directed at two different levels:
Patient level — which includes clinical severity, epidemiological exposures, PK/PD factors, comorbidities, prior antibiotic exposure, prior infection, or colonization with MDROs and infection source
Hospital level — including presence of in-hospital antimicrobial stewardship programs, availability of local guidelines and updated microbiological data, infection control policy, educational activities, and structural resources (like computer-assisted order entry)

Significant data supports the importance of antibiotic prescribing practices for patients with IAIs, in critically ill and non-critically ill patients and in community and hospital-acquired infections. Prescribing practices may influence the outcome and cost of treatment as well as the risk of superinfection and resistant pathogens in the individual patient and the broader environment. Components of antibiotic prescribing practices that may influence outcome and the risk of developing superinfection and antibiotic resistant infections include (a) adequacy of empiric antibiotic therapy, (b) the time to initial antibiotic therapy, (c) appropriate pharmacokinetic dosing, (d) de-escalation of antibiotic therapy, (e) length of treatment, and (f) avoidance of unnecessary antibiotic therapy.

Statement 42

Principal determinants of antibiotic choice in critically ill patients are based on three parameters: 1) Severity of illness, 2) local ecology, and 3) risk factors of the host. Previous antibiotic use is associated with a higher development of multidrug resistant organisms (MDROs). Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, including combination of different antibiotic classes should be recommended in patients with septic shock, settings with high rates of MDRO, and previous antibiotic administration (Recommendation 1B).

Abdominal sepsis is a common indication for admission to the ICU. In 2014, the EPIC II study, including 13,796 adult patients from 1265 ICUs in 75 countries, demonstrated ICU mortality was higher in patients with abdominal infections compared to those with other infections (29.4 vs. 24.4%, P < 0.001). In patients with septic shock, early appropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy has a significant impact on the outcome, independent of the site of infection. Prompt institution of antimicrobial therapy that is active against the causative pathogen(s) is crucial in the treatment of patients with severe infection and sepsis. In fact, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign strongly recommends initiating antibiotic therapy within the first hour of recognition of severe sepsis, after suitable cultures have been obtained. In a retrospective analysis of a large dataset collected prospectively for the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, Ferrer et al. demonstrated that delay in first antibiotic administration was associated with increased in-hospital mortality in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.

An antimicrobial policy of de-escalation therapy consisting of the initial use of wide-spectrum antimicrobials followed by a reassessment of treatment when culture results are available should be a principle of antimicrobial stewardship in critically ill patients. Studies have reported conflicting effects on outcomes with de-escalation in various groups of critically ill patients.

To assess the safety and the impact on in-hospital and 90-day mortality of antibiotic de-escalation in patients admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis or septic shock, a prospective study was published in 2014.

By multivariate analysis, factors independently associated with in-hospital mortality were septic shock, elevated SOFA score the day of culture results, and inadequate empirical antimicrobial therapy. In contrast, de-escalation therapy was a protective factor. However, in 2014, a multicenter randomized trial investigating a strategy based on de-escalation of antibiotics resulted in prolonged duration of ICU stay but did not affect the mortality rate.

For lower-risk patients with CA-IAI who do not have substantial renal or hepatic impairment or severe obesity, the task force believes these dosage recommendations should be fairly accurate. Critically ill patients may benefit from adjusted dosing of many antimicrobial agents, although the evidence supporting this for patients with IAI is mostly limited.

How should the correct antibiotic be chosen in patients with IAIs?

14. In patients with IAIs, empiric antibiotic therapy should be based on the local microbiological epidemiology, clinical severity, and individual patient risk factors for resistant bacteria (Low quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

15. In most patients with IAIs, agents with a narrow spectrum of activity should be preferred. In community-acquired IAIs, the most common resistance problem is posed by alarmingly prevalent extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). (Moderate quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

16. The following risk factors for ESBLs-producing Enterobacterales infections should be always considered: (a) hospitalization for 48 h within the last 90 days, (b) use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for 5 days within the last 90 days, (c) gut colonization by ESBLs within 90 days and (d) patients coming from healthcare settings with a high incidence of MDR bacteria (Low quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

17. Antibiotic therapy aimed at enterococcal coverage should not be routinely prescribed in patients with community-acquired IAIs unless they are immunocompromised (Moderate quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

18. Empirical antibiotic therapy covering MDR Gram-negative bacteria should be considered only in specific settings, and based on country-wide epidemiological conditions, clinical severity, immunological impairment, knowledge of colonization status, prolonged exposure to carbapenems and/or quinolones (Moderate quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

In the setting of IAIs, inappropriate choice of initial antibiotic therapy in patients leads to more clinical failure, resulting in a longer hospital stay and higher costs of hospitalization compared with appropriate initial antibiotic therapy. Before causative agent(s) and susceptibilities are known, the optimal choice of antibiotic therapy depends on the local prevalence of resistant bacteria and patient risk factors for them as long as available microbiological data (e.g. colonization status).

The numerical MIC number, expressed as micrograms/ml, is usually reported by microbiology laboratories as a categorical guide for clinicians, i.e. as "susceptible", "resistant", or "intermediate", according to Clinical or Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) criteria in the USA or the European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) criteria in Europe.

Knowledge of mechanisms of secretion of antibiotics into bile may be helpful in designing the optimal therapeutic regimen for patients with biliary-related intra-abdominal infections (Recommendation 1C).

Organisms most often isolated in biliary infections are those isolated in intra-abdominal infections including the gram-negative aerobes, E. coli and K. pneumonia and anaerobes, especially B. fragilis. The role of enterococci in biliary tract infections remains unclear, and specific coverage against these microorganisms is not routinely suggested for community-acquired biliary infections.

Although there are no clinical data to support the use of antibiotics with biliary penetration for these patients, the efficacy of antibiotics in the treatment of biliary infections may depend on effective biliary antibiotic concentrations too. Obviously in patients with obstructed bile ducts, the biliary penetration of antibiotics may be poor and effective biliary concentrations are reached only in a minority of patients.

Antibiotics commonly used to treat biliary tract infections and their biliary penetration ability are illustrated in Table 5.

Table 5
Antibiotics commonly used to treat biliary tract infections and their biliary penetration ability

Empirical antifungal therapy for Candida species is recommended for patients with hospital-acquired IAIs, especially those with recent abdominal surgery or anastomotic leak (Recommendation 1C).

The epidemiological profile of Candida spp in the context of nosocomial peritonitis is incompletely defined. Its clinical presence is usually associated with poor prognosis. Empirical antifungal therapy for Candida spp is typically not recommended for patients with community-acquired intra-abdominal infections, with the notable exceptions of critically ill patients or immunocompromised patients (due to neutropenia or concurrent administration of immunosuppressive agents, such as glucocorticosteroids, chemotherapeutic agents, and immunomodulators). Recently, IDSA guidelines for the treatment of invasive candidiasis were developed and addressed Candida peritonitis. IDSA guidelines suggested considering empiric antifungal therapy for patients with clinical evidence of intra-abdominal infection and significant risk factors for candidiasis, including recent abdominal surgery, anastomotic leaks, or necrotizing pancreatitis, who are doing poorly despite treatment for bacterial infections.

### Intra-abdominal infections [^117Njdxf]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Most intra-abdominal infections develop from a source in the gastrointestinal tract. They are usually caused by aerobic and anaerobic enteric bacteria. Management generally involves an invasive procedure to control the source of the infection and antimicrobial therapy directed against the causative microorganisms. In a few highly select patients, these infections may be treated without a definitive source control procedure. Antimicrobial therapy is tailored to the individual patient, with narrower spectrum agents used to treat community-acquired intraabdominal infections, and broader spectrum agents used for hospital-acquired infections. Overall, these infections remain associated with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in higher-risk patients who have impaired host defenses.

Antimicrobial therapy

Empirical antibiotic therapy plays a crucial role in the effective management of IAIs; as inadequate initial antimicrobial treatment is associated with less favourable patient outcomes and the emergence of AMR, it is crucial to prescribe antibiotics correctly, with the right spectrum of activity, at the right time, for the right duration and with the right dosage. Optimizing antibiotic prescribing in the hospital setting results in improved treatment effectiveness and patient safety. This minimizes the risk of opportunistic infections such as Clostridioides difficile infection and mitigates the risk of selecting antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. The growing emergence of MDR organisms has caused an impending crisis with alarming implications, particularly concerning Gram-negative bacteria. Antimicrobial treatment should be started when a treatable infection has been recognized or strongly suspected. Misuse and abuse of antimicrobial agents, combined with the inappropriate application of infection prevention and control measures, are recognized as major drivers of the increasing prevalence of AMR.

AMR has become a global threat to public health systems in recent decades. Italy is ranked among the lowest-performing countries in AMR control in Europe by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), primarily due to alarmingly high levels of AMR observed in Italian hospitals. In January 2017 a team of experts in antimicrobial stewardship selected by the ECDC planned a four-day visit to Italy to investigate and evaluate the situation in the country regarding prevention and control of AMR. In the report drafted by the ECDC Committee, the experts highlighted the threat represented by the AMR, and the crucial necessity to design a national plan of action to address this burden.

In 2022, the ECDC published an interesting document evaluating the health impact of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the EU/EEA. The report, covering the period from 2016 to 2020, showed that the overall burden of infections attributed to AMR pathogens, adjusted for population size, was highest in Greece, Italy, and Romania. In Italy, an alarming pattern of resistance involving MDR and extensively drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria has emerged in recent years, and multi-resistant Enterobacterales are now a major concern in daily clinical practice. This phenomenon may be partially attributed to a high average age of the population, predisposing to the development and spread of AMR. However, it is likely to be influenced by a poor perception of the AMR burden. Hence, there is a critical need to raise awareness among Italian healthcare workers regarding the importance of the management of infections, including IAIs.

In 2019 Maseda et al. published a one-year prospective observational study from 17 Spanish ICUs distributing cases of healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs), CA-IAIs and immunocompromised patients. Bacteria producing ESBLs and/or CPE, high-level aminoglycoside- and/or methicillin- and/or vancomycin- resistance were considered AMR. Mortality-associated factors were identified by multivariate regression analysis. Of 345 patients included, 51.6% presented generalized peritonitis; 32.5% were > 75 years. Overall, 11.0% of cases presented AMR (7.0% ESBLs- and/or CPE), being significantly higher in HAIs (35.4%) versus CA-IAIs (5.8%) (p < 0.001) versus immunocompromised patients (0%) (p = 0.003). Overall, the 30-day mortality was 14.5% (23.1% for HAI and 11.6% for CA-IAIs; p = 0.016) and was positively associated with age > 75 years, Candida isolation, and SAPS II level. A lower mortality rate was observed in biliary infections.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the Italian council for the optimization of antimicrobial use [^113sjCPH]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) are common surgical emergencies and are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in hospital settings, particularly if poorly managed. The cornerstones of effective IAIs management include early diagnosis, adequate source control, appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and early physiologic stabilization using intravenous fluids and vasopressor agents in critically ill patients. Adequate empiric antimicrobial therapy in patients with IAIs is of paramount importance because inappropriate antimicrobial therapy is associated with poor outcomes. Optimizing antimicrobial prescriptions improves treatment effectiveness, increases patients' safety, and minimizes the risk of opportunistic infections (such as Clostridioides difficile) and antimicrobial resistance selection. The growing emergence of multi-drug resistant organisms has caused an impending crisis with alarming implications, especially regarding Gram-negative bacteria. The Multidisciplinary and Intersociety Italian Council for the Optimization of Antimicrobial Use promoted a consensus conference on the antimicrobial management of IAIs, including emergency medicine specialists, radiologists, surgeons, intensivists, infectious disease specialists, clinical pharmacologists, hospital pharmacists, microbiologists and public health specialists. Relevant clinical questions were constructed by the Organizational Committee in order to investigate the topic. The expert panel produced recommendation statements based on the best scientific evidence from PubMed and EMBASE Library and experts' opinions. The statements were planned and graded according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) hierarchy of evidence. On November 10, 2023, the experts met in Mestre (Italy) to debate the statements. After the approval of the statements, the expert panel met via email and virtual meetings to prepare and revise the definitive document. This document represents the executive summary of the consensus conference and comprises three sections. The first section focuses on the general principles of diagnosis and treatment of IAIs. The second section provides twenty-three evidence-based recommendations for the antimicrobial therapy of IAIs. The third section presents eight clinical diagnostic-therapeutic pathways for the most common IAIs. The document has been endorsed by the Italian Society of Surgery.

### Tigecycline: the answer to β-lactam and fluoroquinolone resistance? [^114WKPLG]. The Journal of Infection (2006). Low credibility.

Patients with serious bacterial infections such as intra-abdominal infections and complicated skin and soft tissue infections are often treated empirically because a delay in appropriate initial antimicrobial therapy has been shown to significantly increase morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, pathogens that have developed resistance to mainstay therapeutic options are increasing in prevalence making these infections a challenge for physicians. Treatment guidelines for surgical and intra-abdominal infections recommend selection of an agent or a combination of agents with activity to cover both Gram-positive, Gram-negative organisms and anaerobes. Recommended agents include second-generation cephalosporins with anaerobic coverage, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor agents, fluoroquinolone/metronidazole combinations and carbapenems. However, the effectiveness of these agents has come into question as once susceptible organisms are now showing signs of resistance to such antimicrobial therapies. Alternative agents specifically designed to overcome mechanisms of microbial resistance have been sought. The result of that search has been the development of a new class of antimicrobials termed glycylcyclines. The first of these novel antibacterials is tigecycline, with a broad spectrum of activity that includes coverage against vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and many species of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Tigecycline also has activity against most penicillin-susceptible and resistant Gram-positive organisms. Clinical trial experience with tigecycline has shown it to be at least as effective as current recommended regimens for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections and complicated skin and soft tissue infections. This new agent thus holds promise as an alternative to the beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones for the initial empiric treatment of serious bacterial infections.

### Review of the guidelines for complicated skin and soft tissue infections and intra-abdominal infections – are they applicable today? [^117Hg2MC]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Difficult-to-treat infections in surgical patients, such as serious skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) and complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs), are the cause of significant morbidity and mortality, and carry an economic burden. These surgical site infections are typically polymicrobial infections caused by a plethora of pathogens, which include difficult-to-treat organisms and multiresistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains. Optimal management of SSTIs and cIAIs must take into account the presence of resistant pathogens, and depends on the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy (i.e. the correct spectrum, route and dose in a timely fashion for a sufficient duration as well as the timely implementation of source control measures). Treatment recommendations from the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Surgical Infection Society are available for guidance in the management of both of these infections, yet the increased global prevalence of multidrug-resistant pathogens has complicated the antibiotic selection process. Several pathogens of concern include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, responsible for problematic postoperative infections, especially in patients with SSTIs, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacteria, including CTX-M-type-producing Escherichia coli strains, and multidrug-resistant strains of Bacteroides fragilis. New empirical regimens, taking advantage of potent broad-spectrum antibiotic options, may be needed for the treatment of certain high-risk patients with surgical site infections.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^114JvWNU]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

SIS guidelines on intra-abdominal infection — pathogen-directed antimicrobial therapy: We recommend against changing antimicrobial therapy on the basis of culture results in lower-risk patients with CA-IAI who have a satisfactory clinical response to source control and empiric antimicrobial therapy (Grade 1-B). We suggest modifying antimicrobial therapy in higher-risk patients with CA-IAI and HA-IAI to cover identified organisms resistant to the initial empiric regimen and further antimicrobial therapy is planned (Grade 2-C). There are insufficient data to make any recommendation regarding modification of antimicrobial therapy in patients with HA-IAI who have a highly resistant organism isolated as a minor component of a mixed peritoneal culture (no recommendation). We recommend routinely de-escalating or streamlining antimicrobial therapy in higher-risk patients with CA-IAI and HA-IAI to the narrowest-spectrum agent or agents having activity against the isolated micro-organisms, once definitive culture results are available (Grade 1-B).

Enterococcus

The use of antibiotic therapy for Enterococcus in IAI is controversial. Enterococcus can often be isolated from IAI, and is associated with increased risk of treatment failure and higher mortality. However, outcomes in these patients have shown to be independent of antibiotic coverage for enterococcus. Currently, the general consensus regarding enterococcal coverage is that community-acquired infections require no coverage, however ampicillin, or vancomycin should be added to cover the following high risk patient groups: 1) patients in septic shock who have received prolonged treatment with cephalosporins or other antibiotics that select for Enterococcus, 2) immunocompromised patients, 3) patients with prosthetic heart valves, or other intravascular prosthetic devices, or 4) patients with health care associated/recurrent intra-abdominal infection. Finally, vancomycin resistant enterococcal (VRE) infections occur in patients who are immunocompromised, previously colonized with VRE or treated with vancomycin. In these circumstances VRE should be suspected and treated with alternatives such as linezolid, tigecycline, or daptomycin. In the absence of these risk factors, specific coverage for VRE is not recommended.

Candida

Candida is similar to Enterococcus, in that isolation of Candida from intra-abdominal cultures is associated with increased mortality, but anti-fungal treatment has not been shown to alter this risk. Therefore, fungal coverage is unnecessary unless the patient is immunocompromised, has a severe IAI with Candida grown from intra-abdominal cultures, or has perforation of a gastric ulcer while on acid suppressive medications. Fluconazole is an appropriate initial choice for Candida albicans peritonitis. However, increasingly, non-albicans Candida spp. with resistance to commonly used anti-fungals are responsible for candidemia. Studies have shown that echinocandins are both safe and effective in the treatment of invasive candidiasis. Therefore, in critically ill patients echinocandins, such as caspofungin or echinofungin, should be considered for primary treatment. Required treatment duration for Candida peritonitis is 2–3 weeks.

### Characteristics and outcomes of anti-infective de-escalation during health care-associated intra-abdominal infections [^112wbkZQ]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

De-escalation is strongly recommended for antibiotic stewardship. No studies have addressed this issue in the context of health care-associated intra-abdominal infections (HCIAI). We analyzed the factors that could interfere with this process and their clinical consequences in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with HCIAI.

Methods

All consecutive patients admitted for the management of HCIAI who survived more than 3 days following their diagnosis, who remained in the ICU for more than 3 days, and who did not undergo early reoperation during the first 3 days were analyzed prospectively in an observational, single-center study in a tertiary care university hospital.

Results

Overall, 311 patients with HCIAI were admitted to the ICU. De-escalation was applied in 110 patients (53%), and no de-escalation was reported in 96 patients (47%) (escalation in 65 [32%] and unchanged regimen in 31 [15%]). Lower proportions of Enterococcus faecium, nonfermenting Gram-negative bacilli (NFGNB), and multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains were cultured in the de-escalation group. No clinical difference was observed at day 7 between patients who were de-escalated and those who were not. Determinants of de-escalation in multivariate analysis were adequate empiric therapy (OR 9.60, 95% CI 4.02–22.97) and empiric use of vancomycin (OR 3.39, 95% CI 1.46–7.87), carbapenems (OR 2.64, 95% CI 1.01–6.91), and aminoglycosides (OR 2.31 95% CI 1.08–4.94). The presence of NFGNB (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.09–0.89) and the presence of MDR bacteria (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.09–0.52) were risk factors for non-de-escalation. De-escalation did not change the overall duration of therapy. The risk factors for death at day 28 were presence of fungi (HR 2.64, 95% CI 1.34–5.17), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score on admission (HR 1.29, 95% CI 1.16–1.42), and age (HR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01–1.05). The survival rate expressed by a Kaplan-Meier curve was similar between groups (log-rank test p value 0.176).

Conclusions

De-escalation is a feasible option in patients with polymicrobial infections such as HCIAI, but MDR organisms and NFGNB limit its implementation.

Aminoglycoside-based regimens — empiric management of intra-abdominal infection (IAI): We recommend against the routine use of aminoglycoside-based regimens for the empiric treatment of patients with IAI (Grade 1-B). We suggest that these regimens may be useful for treatment of IAI in neonatal patients and in adults and children because of resistant gram-negative organisms, if other agents are not suitable (Grade 2-B). The nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity of these agents as well as the need for therapeutic drug monitoring further complicates their use, and the task force concluded that these agents should not be used routinely for empiric therapy of patients with IAI, though they may be useful when a resistant gram-negative pathogen precludes other classes of agents, and they are still used when treating neonatal patients with IAI.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the Italian council for the optimization of antimicrobial use [^1175dxW3]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) are common surgical emergencies and represent an important intra-hospital cause of morbidity and mortality, especially if poorly treated. IAIs represent a notable factor contributing to the loss of both human lives and resources across global hospital settings. The WISS study reported an estimated overall mortality rate of 9.2% among patients affected by complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs) globally. The grading of the clinical severity of patients with cIAIs has been well described by the sepsis definitions. The data from WISS study showed that mortality was significantly affected by sepsis status when divided into four categories. Mortality rates increase in patients developing organ dysfunction and septic shock. Mortality by sepsis status was as follows: no sepsis 1.2%, sepsis only 4.4%, severe sepsis 27.8%, and septic shock 67.8%.

Despite still high mortality, short-term survival from sepsis of abdominal origin has improved in recent years. As a result, there is a growing population of sepsis survivors, and with rapid implementation of evidence-based care, early mortality has decreased substantially, but many sepsis survivors are now progressing into chronic critical illness with poorly defined long-term outcomes. These patients frequently experience new symptoms, long-term disability, worsening of chronic health conditions, and increased risk for death following sepsis hospitalization.

Defining the patient with IAIs at high risk for failure is difficult. "High risk" may be attributed to the patient's underlying condition(s), such as age, comorbidity or the disease severity status on presentation. However, a "low-risk" patient may be converted to "high risk" if the care provider loses the "window of opportunity" to diagnose, resuscitate, and start timely treatment. Thus, there are numerous situations that must be taken into account when addressing high-risk patients and treatment failure.

In general, high-risk IAI is attributed to patient factors (advanced age, immunosuppression, malignant disease, and pre-existing medical comorbidities) or disease factors, represented by high-risk scores (such as ASA, APACHE, SOFA scores), delay in intervention (usually > 24 h), inability to obtain source control, and an IAI that is hospital acquired (rather than community acquired).

The cornerstones of IAIs management encompass timely diagnosis, adequate source control, early and appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and expeditious physiological stabilization through intravenous fluid therapy and vasopressor agents, in critically ill patients.

Once appropriate initial loading is achieved, daily reassessment of the antimicrobial regimen is warranted, because the pathophysiological changes that may occur could significantly affect drug disposition in the critically ill patients.

Conversely, it is less evident that higher than standard dosages of renally excreted drugs may be needed for optimal exposure in patients with glomerular hyperfiltration.

Therefore, selecting higher dosages and/or alternative dosing regimens focused on maximizing the pharmacodynamics of antimicrobials might be worthwhile, with the intent being to increase clinical cure rates among critically ill patients.

Indeed, different approaches should be pursued according to the mechanism of antimicrobial activity exhibited by each antimicrobial. Two patterns of bactericidal activity have been identified: time-dependent activity (where the time that the plasma concentration persists above the MIC of the etiological agent is considered the major determinant for efficacy) and concentration-dependent activity (where the efficacy is mainly related to the plasma peak concentration in relation to the MIC of the microorganism). In addition, these agents show an associated concentration-dependent post-antibiotic effect, and bactericidal action continues for a period of time after the antibiotic level falls below the MIC.

Beta-lactams, glycopeptides, oxazolidinones, and azoles exhibit time-dependent activity: the shorter the drug elimination half-life, the more frequent the daily dose fractioning must be. For these drugs the employ of intravenous continuous infusion, which ensures the highest steady-state concentration under the same total daily dosage, may be the most effective way of maximizing pharmacodynamic exposure.

On the other hand, quinolones, daptomycin, tigecycline, aminoglycosides, polienes and echionocandins exhibit concentration-dependent activity; therefore the entire daily dose should be administered in a once daily way (or with the lowest possible number of daily administrations) with the intent of achieving the highest peak plasma level.

### Intensive care unit management of intra-abdominal infection [^117BfFRy]. Critical Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the biologic characteristics of, and management approaches to, intra-abdominal infection in the critically ill patient.

Design

Narrative review.

Setting

Medline review focussed on intra-abdominal infection in the critically ill patient.

Patients and Subjects

Restricted to studies involving human subjects.

Interventions

None.

Results

Intra-abdominal infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU). Peritonitis can be classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary, the unique pathologic features reflecting the complex nature of the endogenous gut flora and the gut-associated immune system, and the alterations of these that occur in critical illness. Outcome is dependent on timely and accurate diagnosis, vigorous resuscitation and antibiotic support, and decisive implementation of optimal source control measures, specifically the drainage of abscesses and collections of infected fluid, the debridement of necrotic infected tissue, and the use of definitive measures to prevent further contamination and to restore anatomy and function.

Conclusions

Optimal management of intra-abdominal infection in the critically ill patient is based on the synthesis of evidence, an understanding of biologic principles, and clinical experience. An algorithm outlining a clinical approach to the ICU patient with complex intra-abdominal infection is presented.

Discussion

uIAI include uncomplicated appendicitis or acute cholecystitis, traumatic bowel perforations managed within 12 hours, gastroduodenal perforations operated on within 24 hours, and resected ischemic bowel. cIAI are any IAI that extend beyond the site of origin or include the peritoneum. Treatment should involve prompt source control including emergent or urgent surgical exploration commensurate with the level of illness. Percutaneous options can be used if they achieve good source control. Any delay > 24 hours is a predictor of failure and should be avoided. In systemically ill patients or patients with sepsis, initial blood cultures are indicated. Fluid or tissue from the source control procedure should be obtained to target antimicrobial selection.

Antimicrobial therapy should be initiated as soon as an IAI is diagnosed or considered likely. The selection of antibiotics should be based on the local antibiogram and guided by a combination of culture results and the patient's clinical status. Empiric antibiotics for severe community-acquired IAIs should include broad-spectrum Gram-negative coverage. Anaerobic coverage is also needed for which metronidazole is a recommended regimen, while for patients receiving piperacillin-tazobactam metronidazole is not necessary. Dual anerobic coverage is not recommended (except in specific infections including complicated C. difficile infections with vancomycin plus metronidazole and toxic shock syndrome for which treatment includes both vancomycin and clindamycin). In healthcare-associated infections, patients should be covered for MRSA such as with vancomycin or linezolid. High-risk patients should be given enterococcal coverage such as with vancomycin if they are not being treated with piperacillin-tazobactam.

Patients with uIAI can be managed with either a single dose of perioperative antibiotic or a maximum of 24 hours of therapy. For cIAI, the most recent guidelines from the IDSA in 2010 and the Surgical Infection Society (SIS) in 2017 recommend shorter courses of antibiotics in patients who have adequate source control, 4–7 days and 4 days, respectively. The Study to Optimize Peritoneal Infection Therapy (STOP-IT trial) concluded that 4 days is sufficient. The SIS recommends a short 5–7 days course in patients without adequate source control with a reassessment of potential source control if the patient remains ill. We concur that there has not been evidence that describes a situation of IAI where courses > 7 days are recommended, even in the presence of intraperitoneal sources with secondary bacteremia, and we agree that the emphasis is on thorough diagnostic evaluation and consideration for additional procedures when there is suspected failure of source control.

### The management of intra-abdominal infections from a global perspective: 2017 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^116hVvqK]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

In the setting of cIAIs, a short course of antibiotic therapy (3–5 days) after adequate source control is a reasonable option. The recent prospective trial by Sawyer et al. demonstrated that in patients with cIAI undergoing an adequate source control, the outcomes after approximately 4 days fixed-duration antibiotic therapy were similar to those after a longer course of antibiotics that extended until after the resolution of physiological abnormalities. However, in critically ill patients with ongoing sepsis, an individualized approach should be always mandatory and patient's inflammatory response should be monitored regularly and decisions to continue, narrow, or stop antimicrobial therapy must be made on the basis of clinician judgment.

Patients who have ongoing signs of peritonitis or systemic illness beyond 5–7 days of antibiotic treatment normally warrant a diagnostic investigation to determine whether additional surgical intervention is necessary to address an ongoing uncontrolled source of infection or antimicrobial treatment failure. The prolonged and inappropriate use of antibiotics appears a key factor in the rapid rise of antimicrobial resistance worldwide over the past decade. A rational and appropriate use of antibiotics is particularly important both to optimize quality clinical care and to reduce selection pressure on resistant pathogens. Several strategies aiming at achieving optimal use of antimicrobial agents have been described, but it is important that surgeons know antibiotic administration minimal requirements. Without these minimal requirements, surgeons worldwide will increase the likelihood of treatment failures and antibiotic resistance.

The choice of empiric antibiotic regimens in patients with IAI should be based on the clinical condition of the patients, the individual risk for infection by resistant pathogens, and the local resistance epidemiology (Recommendation 1C).

Intra-abdominal infections may be managed with either single or multiple antibiotic regimens.

Beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations have an in vitro activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobe organisms. Amoxicillin/clavulanate is still an option in mild community acquired IAIs. Broad-spectrum activity of piperacillin/tazobactam, including anti- P. seudomonas effect and anaerobic coverage, still make it an interesting option for management of severe IAIs. However, the use of piperacillin/tazobactam in patients with ESBLs infections is still controversial, even if in stable patients, it may be still a therapeutic chance.

### A focus on intra-abdominal infections [^113AQabE]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Many factors can increase the risk of colonization with VRE. These include previous antibiotic therapy, the number and duration of antibiotics received, prolonged hospitalization, hospitalization in an intensive care unit and concomitant serious illness.

Several antibiotics have been implicated for VRE acquisition, but use of vancomycin and third-generation cephalosporins have appeared to be associated most commonly with the spread of VRE.

Against Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) linezolid, tigecycline, quinupristin/dalfopristin, or daptomycin should be considered.

Empirical treatment against Enterococci and has not been generally recommended for patients who have community-acquired intra-abdominal infections. However Enterococci isolation may be a risk factor for treatment failure and it has been suggested that if initial antibiotic therapy does not cover for Enterococci, patients may have an increased risk of postoperative complications and death. Recently Riché et al. published a prospective observational study involving 180 consecutive patients with secondary generalized peritonitis (community-acquired and postoperative) which analyzed clinical and bacteriological factors associated with the occurrence of shock and mortality in patients with secondary generalized peritonitis. Frequency of septic shock was 41% and overall mortality rate was 19%. Patients with septic shock had a mortality rate of 35%, versus 8% for patients without shock. Septic shock occurrence and mortality rate were not different between community-acquired and postoperative peritonitis. Age over 65, two or more microorganisms, or anaerobes in peritoneal fluid culture were independent risk factors of shock. Intraperitoneal yeasts and Enterococci were associated with septic shock in community-acquired peritonitis. Their findings supported the deleterious role of Enterococcus species in peritoneal fluid, reinforcing the need of prospective trials to evaluate systematic treatment against these microorganisms in patients with secondary peritonitis.

Enterococcal infection should be suspected in patients with post-operative or nosocomial infections, in patients with recent exposure to broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents especially cephalosporins, in immunocompromised patients and in patients with valvular heart disease or prosthetic intravascular materials. Expanded spectrum agents against enterocci should be also recommended for these patients with severe sepsis and septic shock in which a de escalation approach of an initially broad antimicrobial regimen to scale when definitive culture results are available.

For community-acquired biliary infection, antimicrobial activity against enterococci should be not required, because the pathogenicity of enterococci has not been demonstrated. For selected immunosuppressed patients, particularly those with hepatic transplantation, enterococcal infections may be significant and require treatment also for community-acquired biliary infection.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the WSES 2016 consensus conference [^115EGnER]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Early clinical diagnosis, adequate source control to stop ongoing contamination, appropriate antimicrobial therapy dictated by patient and infection risk factors, and prompt resuscitation in critically ill patients are the cornerstones in the management of IAIs. However, several critical controversies can be debated in the management of these patients. Application of management principles to the individual patient is crucial to optimize outcome. In order to clarify these major controversies in the management of IAI, many of the world's leading experts met in Dublin, Ireland, on July 23, 2016, for a specialist multidisciplinary consensus conference under the auspices of the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) and with the support of the World Society of Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (WSACS).

### The management of intra-abdominal infections from a global perspective: 2017 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^115vNQVW]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) are common surgical emergencies and have been reported as major contributors to non-trauma deaths in the emergency departments worldwide. The cornerstones of effective treatment of IAIs are early recognition, adequate source control, and appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Prompt resuscitation of patients with ongoing sepsis is of utmost important. In hospitals worldwide, non-acceptance of, or lack of access to, accessible evidence-based practices and guidelines result in overall poorer outcome of patients suffering IAIs. The aim of this paper is to promote global standards of care in IAIs and update the 2013 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections.

### Antimicrobials: a global alliance for optimizing their rational use in intra-abdominal infections (AGORA) [^113Fh5Bj]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Intra-abdominal infections (IAI) are an important cause of morbidity and are frequently associated with poor prognosis, particularly in high-risk patients. The cornerstones in the management of complicated IAIs are timely effective source control with appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Empiric antimicrobial therapy is important in the management of intra-abdominal infections and must be broad enough to cover all likely organisms because inappropriate initial antimicrobial therapy is associated with poor patient outcomes and the development of bacterial resistance. The overuse of antimicrobials is widely accepted as a major driver of some emerging infections (such as C. difficile), the selection of resistant pathogens in individual patients, and for the continued development of antimicrobial resistance globally. The growing emergence of multi-drug resistant organisms and the limited development of new agents available to counteract them have caused an impending crisis with alarming implications, especially with regards to Gram-negative bacteria. An international task force from 79 different countries has joined this project by sharing a document on the rational use of antimicrobials for patients with IAIs. The project has been termed AGORA (Antimicrobials: A Global Alliance for Optimizing their Rational Use in Intra-Abdominal Infections). The authors hope that AGORA, involving many of the world's leading experts, can actively raise awareness in health workers and can improve prescribing behavior in treating IAIs.

### Intra-abdominal infections [^112S5LVM]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Intra-abdominal infections are multifactorial, but all require prompt identification, diagnosis, and treatment. Resuscitation, early antibiotic administration, and source control are crucial. Antibiotic administration should initially be broad spectrum and target the most likely pathogens. When cultures are available, antibiotics should be narrowed and limited in duration. The method of source control depends on the anatomic site, site accessibility, and the patient's clinical condition. Patient-specific factors (advanced age and chronic medical conditions) as well as disease-specific factors (health care-associated infections and inability to obtain source control) combine to affect patient morbidity and mortality.

Once initial loading is achieved, it is recommended that clinicians reassess the antimicrobial regimen daily, given that pathophysiological changes may occur that significantly alter drug disposition in critically ill patients.

Lower-than-standard dosages of renally excreted drugs must be administered in the presence of impaired renal function, while higher-than-standard dosages of renally excreted drugs may be required for optimal exposure in patients with glomerular hyperfiltration.

Table 2 overviews recommended dosing regimens of the most commonly used renally excreted antimicrobials.

Table 2
Recommended dosing regimens (according to renal function) of the most commonly used renally excreted antimicrobials

The therapeutic approach undertaken by clinicians must take into account the activity of employed antimicrobials.

Antibiotics such as quinolones, daptomycin, tigecycline, aminoglycosides, polienes, and echinocandins exhibit concentration-dependent activity; as such, the dose should be administered in a once-a-day manner (or with the lowest possible daily administrations) in order to achieve zenithal plasma levels.

Beta-lactams, glycopeptides, oxazolidinones, and azoles exhibit time-dependent activity and exert optimal bactericidal activity when drug concentrations are maintained above the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC).

The efficacy of time-dependent antibacterial agents in severely ill patients is related primarily to the maintenance of supra-inhibitory concentrations, and therefore multiple daily dosing may be appropriate.

For these drugs, continuous intravenous infusion ensures the highest steady-state concentration under the same dosage constraints and may therefore be the most effective means of maximizing pharmacodynamic exposure.

For patients with community-acquired intra-abdominal infections (CA-IAIs), agents with a narrower spectrum of activity are preferred. However, if CA-IAI patients have prior exposure to antibiotics or serious comorbidities requiring concurrent antibioitic therapy, anti-ESBL-producer converage may be warranted. By contrast, for patients with healthcare-associated infections, antimicrobial regimens with broader spectra of activity are preferred (Recommendation 1B).

### A focus on intra-abdominal infections [^111aQ46b]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Complicated intra-abdominal infections are an important cause of morbidity and are frequently associated with a poor prognosis.

Despite advances in diagnosis, surgery, antimicrobial therapy mortality associated with complicated intra-abdominal infections remains still unacceptably high.

Early adequate source control remains the cornerstone of intra-abdominal infection management. Early control of the septic source can be achieved either by nonoperative or operative means. Timing and adequacy of source control is the most important issue in the management of intra-abdominal infections, because an inadequate and late operation may have a negative effect on outcome.

Recent advances in interventional and more aggressive techniques are debated and are not validated by limited prospective trials.

Concomitant adequate empiric antimicrobial therapy further influences patients morbidity and mortality. Inappropriate antibiotic therapy of intra-abdominal infections may result in poor patient outcome and the selection of an appropriate agent is a real challenge because of the emerging resistance of target organisms to commonly prescribed antibiotics.

### Limitations of vancomycin in the management of resistant staphylococcal infections [^116wLKhk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Vancomycin is effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and has been widely used in the past few years. However, several recent reports have highlighted the limitations of vancomycin, and its role in the management of serious infections is now being reconsidered. Vancomycin treatment failure rates are associated with an increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration as well as a decrease in the rate of bacterial killing. The intrinsic limitations of vancomycin also include poor tissue penetration, particularly in the lung; relatively slow bacterial killing; and the potential for toxicity. In addition, intermediate-level vancomycin resistance has emerged among staphylococci, as have rare cases of fully resistant strains. Because of these problems, when using vancomycin, it is probably prudent to carefully establish the diagnosis, test for antimicrobial susceptibility, and monitor serum trough concentrations to ensure adequate dosing.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the WSES 2016 consensus conference [^111bPTgq]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

The results of microbiological testing may have great importance for the choice of therapeutic strategy of every patient, in particular in the adaptation of targeted antimicrobial treatment.

They provide an opportunity to expand antimicrobial regimen if the initial choice was too narrow but also allow de-escalation of antimicrobial therapy if the empirical regimen was too broad.

Antibiotic de-escalation has been associated with lower mortality rates in ICU patients and is now considered a key practice for antimicrobial stewardship purposes.

Recently, Montravers et al. valued the characteristics and outcomes of anti-infective de-escalation during healthcare-associated IAIs. They demonstrated that de-escalation is a feasible option in patients with polymicrobial infections such as HAI-IAIs. However, MDR non-fermenting Gram-negative organisms limit its implementation in the setting of IAIs.

Statement 27

In the settings with a high incidence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, the extended use of cephalosporins should be discouraged and should be limited to pathogen-directed therapy because of its selective pressure resulting in emergence of resistance (Recommendation 1C).

In the past, cephalosporins have often been used in the treatment of IAIs. In light of the increasing prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and MRSA due to selection pressures related to overuse of cephalosporins, the routine use of these antibiotics should be strongly discouraged.

Ceftolozane/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibactam are two new cephalosporins/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations approved for IAIs.

By adding beta-lactamase inhibitor (tazobactam or avibactam), ceftozolane and ceftazidime have a strong activity against Gram-negative MDROs including ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae.
