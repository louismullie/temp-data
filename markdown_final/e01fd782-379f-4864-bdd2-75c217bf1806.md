## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which molecular target is inhibited by the wild mushroom toxin causing this patient's severe delayed hepatotoxicity, from the options RNA polymerase II, RNA polymerase III, prokaryotic RNA polymerase, and topoisomerase. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and whether it fits amatoxin poisoning. Then, I should verify the classic time course and organ-specific injury pattern. Next, I will examine the molecular mechanism of the culprit toxin. Finally, I will match the mechanism to the correct answer choice and briefly consider why the other options are incorrect.

> Let me first confirm the clinical pattern. The patient has severe right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, and markedly elevated AST and ALT in the thousands, with coagulopathy suggested by petechiae, following a several-hour delay after mushroom ingestion; this delayed-onset hepatotoxicity with a quiescent interval is classic for amatoxin-containing mushrooms such as Amanita phalloides, and the timing and laboratory pattern strongly support that diagnosis rather than early-onset GI irritants or neurotoxic species [^113fNrSi] [^113G4gX4] [^111cHwFS].

> Wait, let me verify the time course before I anchor on mechanism. Amatoxin poisoning typically presents with a latent period of roughly 6–24 hours, followed by severe gastroenteritis, then a deceptive clinical improvement, and subsequently progressive hepatocellular injury with coagulopathy and potential multiorgan failure; this staged evolution matches the vignette's delayed, severe transaminitis and jaundice, reinforcing amatoxin as the likely cause [^113fNrSi] [^113G4gX4] [^111cHwFS].

> I will now examine the molecular mechanism. The primary lethal amatoxin, α-amanitin, exerts toxicity by binding to and inhibiting DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II, thereby halting mRNA transcription and precipitating hepatocyte apoptosis and necrosis; this is the canonical mechanism described across clinical toxicology and mechanistic reviews, and it explains the profound hepatocellular injury seen in this case [^111cHwFS] [^112SR527] [^116eeiKS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check the answer choices against this mechanism. The question asks which molecule is inhibited by the most likely cause of this presentation; given the amatoxin mechanism, the correct answer is RNA polymerase II, which corresponds to option A [^111cHwFS] [^112SR527] [^116eeiKS].

> Let me consider why the other options are incorrect, just to be sure. RNA polymerase III is not the target of amatoxins; the clinically relevant inhibition is at RNA polymerase II, which is responsible for mRNA synthesis in eukaryotic cells, whereas RNA polymerase III synthesizes small RNAs like tRNAs and 5S rRNA and is not implicated in amatoxin toxicity; prokaryotic RNA polymerase is a bacterial target and is irrelevant to human eukaryotic transcription; topoisomerase enzymes regulate DNA topology and are not the principal target of amatoxins, so options B, C, and D do not fit the established mechanism [^111cHwFS] [^112SR527] [^116eeiKS].

> In summary, after verifying the clinical syndrome, time course, and molecular mechanism, the toxin responsible for this delayed, severe hepatotoxicity inhibits RNA polymerase II, making option A the correct choice [^116GAkEN] [^111cHwFS].

---

The patient's presentation is most consistent with **amatoxin poisoning** from Amanita phalloides, given the delayed onset of severe gastrointestinal symptoms followed by acute liver injury with markedly elevated transaminases and jaundice [^113G4gX4] [^113fNrSi]. Amatoxins inhibit **RNA polymerase II**, halting mRNA synthesis and causing hepatocyte apoptosis and necrosis [^111cHwFS] [^112SR527]. The correct answer is **A. RNA polymerase II**.

---

## Clinical features of amatoxin poisoning

Amatoxin poisoning typically progresses through **three distinct phases**:

- **Gastrointestinal phase**: Occurs 6–24 hours after ingestion, characterized by severe nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, often leading to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances [^113G4gX4] [^116GAkEN].

- **Latent phase**: Follows the gastrointestinal phase, lasting 24–48 hours, during which the patient may appear clinically improved, but liver enzymes continue to rise due to ongoing hepatocellular damage [^111cHwFS] [^112SR527].

- **Hepatic phase**: Occurs 48–72 hours post-ingestion, marked by acute liver failure, jaundice, coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and multi-organ failure [^111cHwFS] [^116V5iQf].

---

## Laboratory findings in amatoxin poisoning

Laboratory studies typically reveal **significantly elevated liver enzymes** (AST, ALT), hyperbilirubinemia, coagulopathy (elevated INR), and renal impairment (elevated creatinine, BUN) [^111cHwFS] [^116V5iQf]. The patient's laboratory results — AST 3278 U/L, ALT 3045 U/L, and elevated creatinine — are consistent with severe hepatocellular injury and renal impairment, further supporting the diagnosis of amatoxin poisoning [^112dTLv4].

---

## Mechanism of toxicity

Amatoxins, particularly alpha-amanitin, are the primary toxins responsible for the clinical manifestations observed in this patient. These toxins are **heat-stable bicyclic octapeptides** that are readily absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract and transported into hepatocytes via the organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP1B3) transporter [^115bGs42]. Once inside hepatocytes, amatoxins **specifically inhibit RNA polymerase II**, a crucial enzyme responsible for transcribing DNA into messenger RNA (mRNA) [^111cHwFS] [^112SR527]. This inhibition halts protein synthesis, leading to cellular apoptosis and necrosis, particularly in hepatocytes and renal tubular cells [^111cHwFS] [^116eeiKS].

---

## Molecular target of amatoxin toxicity

The question specifically asks which molecule is inhibited by the toxin responsible for the patient's clinical presentation. The correct answer is **RNA polymerase II**, which is directly inhibited by amatoxins, resulting in the cessation of mRNA synthesis and subsequent cellular death [^111cHwFS] [^112SR527].

---

## Clinical implications of RNA polymerase II inhibition

Inhibition of RNA polymerase II by amatoxins leads to **rapid depletion of essential proteins** within hepatocytes, resulting in:

- **Disruption of cellular metabolism**: Loss of critical enzymes and structural proteins impairs cellular function and integrity [^116GAkEN].

- **Induction of apoptosis and necrosis**: Cellular death pathways are activated, leading to widespread hepatocyte destruction [^112SR527].

- **Acute liver failure**: Massive hepatocyte death culminates in acute liver failure, characterized by jaundice, coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and multi-organ failure [^113fNrSi] [^116V5iQf].

---

## Treatment considerations

Management of amatoxin poisoning primarily involves **supportive care**, including aggressive fluid resuscitation, correction of electrolyte imbalances, and close monitoring of liver and renal function [^116GAkEN] [^113G4gX4]. Specific therapies such as **intravenous silibinin**, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and penicillin G have been employed, although their efficacy remains debated and largely based on limited clinical evidence [^116GAkEN] [^117LK1ir]. Liver transplantation may be necessary in cases of **irreversible acute liver failure** [^116GAkEN] [^1162RxWx].

---

## Conclusion

The patient's clinical presentation is most consistent with amatoxin poisoning from Amanita phalloides, characterized by delayed gastrointestinal symptoms followed by acute liver failure. The primary mechanism of toxicity involves **inhibition of RNA polymerase II**, leading to cessation of protein synthesis, hepatocyte apoptosis, and acute liver failure [^111cHwFS] [^112SR527]. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is **A. RNA polymerase II**.

3 How should this condition be managed?

Consider calling the local poisons control centre for advice. Generally, treatment is primarily supportive with antiemetics and analgesics. Antidiarrhoeals are not recommended as the toxin is eliminated in faeces. If the mushroom species is known or symptoms fit a specific toxidrome, management should be tailored to the toxin ingested. For example, if cholinergic symptoms are present, treat with atropine and if poisoning is related to amatoxin, treat with N-acetylcysteine and silibinin.

Patients with mild gastrointestinal symptoms and an onset of symptoms less than six hours after ingestion who are able to tolerate oral intake and have no serious medical history may be managed at home. These patients should be reassessed within 24 hours.

Learning points

Clinical presentations for mushroom toxicity range from benign to severe depending on the species, quantity ingested, and frailty of the patient.
Investigations may be required depending on clinical presentation (including time of symptom onset — hours after ingestion) and species ingested.
Supportive treatment without antidiarrhoeals is the mainstay of management; toxic specific management should be instituted in some poisonings.
Prevention and patient education remain essential.

Although mushroom poisoning is relatively uncommon, it can result in severe illness. Because most illnesses from poisonous mushroom ingestion are preventable, increased public awareness about the potential dangers of mushroom poisoning is needed. Given the potential severity and preventable nature of most poisonous mushroom ingestions, wild mushrooms should not be consumed unless identified by an expert and continued public health messaging about this topic is warranted.

### A case study: what doses of amanita phalloides and amatoxins are lethal to humans? [^11729tXh]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

There are few data estimating the human lethal dose of amatoxins or of the toxin level present in ingested raw poisonous mushrooms. Here, we present a patient who intentionally ingested several wild collected mushrooms to assess whether they were poisonous. Nearly 1 day after ingestion, during which the patient had nausea and vomiting, he presented at the emergency department. His transaminase levels started to increase starting from hour 48 and peaking at hour 72 (alanine aminotransferase 2496 IU/L; aspartate aminotransferase 1777 IU/L). A toxin analysis was carried out on the mushrooms that the patient said he had ingested. With reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography analysis, an uptake of approximately 21.3 mg amatoxin from nearly 50 g mushroom was calculated; it consisted of 11.9 mg alpha amanitin, 8.4 mg beta amanitin, and 1 mg gamma amanitin. In the urine sample taken on day 4, 2.7 ng/mL alpha amanitin and 1.25 ng/mL beta amanitin were found, and there was no gamma amanitin. Our findings suggest that the patient ingested approximately 0.32 mg/kg amatoxin, and fortunately recovered after serious hepatotoxicity developed.

Mold toxin exposure by inhalation and ingestion has significant health consequences for humans. In this article, we discuss the sources of these everyday toxins and their relevance to patient health. The effects of mycotoxins can present across all body systems, and the resulting symptoms can be acute, cumulative, and chronic. These effects can occur discretely, but they can also present alongside other clinical entities. It is important for the clinician to recognize the phenomenon of mycotoxin illness, because as a primary cause, it does not resolve with current standards of care for conditions secondary to it.

### Mycotoxins revisited: part I [^1147A6qz]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Mushrooms are ubiquitous in nature. They are an important source of nutrition; however, certain varieties contain chemicals that can be highly toxic to humans. Industrially cultivated mushrooms are historically very safe, but foraging for mushrooms or accidental ingestion of mushrooms in the environment can result in serious illness and death. The emergency department is the most common site of presentation for patients suffering from acute mushroom poisoning. Although recognition can be facilitated by identification of a characteristic toxidrome, the presenting manifestations can be variable and have considerable overlap with more common and generally benign clinical syndromes. The goal of this two-part article is to review the knowledge base on this subject and provide information that will assist the clinician in the early consideration, diagnosis and treatment of mushroom poisoning. Part I, presented in this issue of the Journal, reviews the epidemiology and demographics of mushroom poisoning, the physical characteristics of the most toxic varieties, the classification of the toxic species, and an overview of the cyclopeptide-containing mushroom class. Part II, to be published in the next issue of the Journal, will be focused on the presentation of the other classes of toxic mushrooms along with an up-to-date review of the most recently identified poisonous varieties.

Answers

1 What is the most likely diagnosis?

Mushroom poisoning. It is estimated to affect 4–22 people per million population per year in the US and Europe.

Mushroom poisoning can range from mild symptoms such as gastrointestinal disturbances and dermatitis to severe symptoms such as hypovolaemic shock, agitation, delirium, confusion, and seizure, and even secondary hepatorenal failure. The clinical presentation depends on the species of mushroom ingested, quantity, and toxin — for example, amatoxin and muscarine.

Of 5000 known mushroom species, only 200–300 have been established as safe to eat and about 50–100 are poisonous to humans. Identification of a mushroom relies on direct examination of the fungus or a photograph. Other factors that may help include the location where the mushroom was picked and its description.

Chlorophyllum brunneum (fig 1, bottom panel) and Rubroboletus satanas (fig 2, bottom panel) belong to a large, diverse group of mushrooms that cause gastrointestinal irritation. The mycotoxins in these mushrooms mainly cause gastrointestinal symptoms within six hours of ingestion and these usually last less than eight hours.

Fig 2
Neoboletus erythropus (top), an edible species of mushroom, and Rubroboletus satanas (bottom), a species that contains mycotoxin

Ingestion of Amanita phalloides (known as death cap), which contains amatoxin, typically results in persistent gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal cramps, vomiting, and profuse watery diarrhoea (with symptom onset more than six hours after ingestion and lasting more than eight hours). Symptoms may progress to hepatorenal failure.

Some other Aminata species, such as A muscaria and A pantherina, may lead to central nervous system effects such as delirium, agitation, and seizures.

Clitocybe and Inocybe species contain muscarine toxin. Affected patients present with cholinergic toxicity such as miosis, diaphoresis, hypersalivation, and bradycardia.

2 What further investigations are required?

Investigations depend on the onset and duration of the clinical presentation, medical history, and severity of presentation.

Patients with mild gastrointestinal symptoms within six hours of ingestion and no serious medical history (eg, cardiac, renal, or pregnancy) may not require further investigations. Patients with severe gastrointestinal symptoms, however, should undergo baseline tests such as for complete blood count, renal (eg, creatinine) and liver function, and electrolytes. Patients with any other symptoms require immediate referral to hospital.

### Health care utilization and outcomes associated with accidental poisonous mushroom ingestions-United States, 2016–2018 [^112AhvZn]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study, which analyzed administrative data sets, found that 1,328 accidental poisonous mushroom ingestions were treated in EDs during 2016, and during 2016–2018 serious adverse outcomes occurred in 8.6% (48 of 556) of patients who sought care for accidental poisonous mushroom ingestions. Serious adverse outcomes were more common in patients with Medicaid than in patients with commercial or Medicare insurance, suggesting that severe consequences of poisonous mushroom ingestions might be more common among patients with lower socioeconomic status. A small proportion of patients aged > 5 years (10%) received a diagnosis of hallucinogenic drug ingestion, suggesting that most accidental mushroom poisonings occurred because of consumption of foraged mushrooms for food rather than ingestion for hallucinogenic purposes.

Adverse outcomes from poisonous mushroom ingestions might occur because amateur mushroom foragers might not distinguish poisonous from nonpoisonous species. Recent immigrants are also at risk for mushroom poisonings because they might mistake poisonous mushrooms for nontoxic varieties found in other countries. Accidental mushroom poisoning diagnoses were more common in the summer and most frequently occurred in the western United States; this might reflect regional differences in the popularity of recreational mushroom foraging or the fact that Amanita smithiana, a potentially deadly and easily misidentified mushroom species that causes gastrointestinal symptoms followed by acute renal failure, is more common in this region. The public should be aware that poisonous mushrooms might resemble nonpoisonous mushrooms, cooking mushrooms does not remove or inactivate toxins, and that wild mushrooms should never be consumed unless they are identified by an expert.

Patient outcome

The patient was treated with oral rehydration. Here symptoms as well as those of her husband and daughter resolved the next day. The patient was advised to avoid mushrooms if in doubt and to photograph any ingested mushrooms in the future.

Patient involvement

One patient reminded us that it is essential to establish the link between the delay in onset of symptoms (several hours) and potential seriousness of the poisoning. She also emphasised the urgency of hospital treatment to benefit from antidote treatment, despite the presence of falsely reassuring initial test results. She highlighted that the rapid progression of the illness and the results of blood tests can be important stressors for patients.

### Acute liver failure guidelines [^113fNrSi]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Acute liver failure — amatoxin mushroom poisoning clinical course: Approximately 50 lethal exposures are reported annually in the United States, and ingestion of only 1 to 2 medium-sized mushroom caps is enough to deliver a lethal dose of amanitin; patients typically progress through three phases after ingestion with 6–12 hours of gastroenteritis, 24–36 hours of a quiescent period with evolving hepatotoxicity, and 4–7 days to progressive liver and multiorgan failure; confirmatory tests are not available, and more recent data suggest most patients (23/27 patients) survive without transplantation.

### Amanita bisporigera ingestion: mistaken identity, dose-related toxicity, and improvement despite severe hepatotoxicity [^1173pZWr]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2006). Low credibility.

Ingestion of wild mushrooms has led to unintentional poisonings caused by mistaken identity. We report 3 cases of exposure to Amanita bisporigera, demonstrating dose-related toxicity. The use of nasobiliary drainage as a novel approach to interrupting the enterohepatic circulation of amatoxins is illustrated. Pathophysiology and treatment of Amanita poisoning are reviewed.

### Case series: alcohol intolerance with coprine-like syndrome after consumption of the mushroom lepiota aspera (pers.: fr.) QuéL., 1886 (freckled dapperling) [^1141Q7rj]. Clinical Toxicology (2011). Low credibility.

Alcohol intolerance after consumption of wild mushrooms is a recognized phenomenon. This is best understood with Coprinus atramentarius. Its active component Coprine blocks enzymatic ethanol degradation at the stage of acetaldehyde, which is responsible for the well-recognized symptoms. Here, we report three events in five patients experiencing the same symptoms after consumption of self-collected Lepiota aspera. All had mistaken L. aspera for edible mushrooms as Amanita rubescens or Macrolepiota procera. In all events, L. aspera was identified by mycologists and no other mushrooms were involved. The mushrooms were well sautéed and tolerated well until an alcoholic beverage was consumed. Then within few minutes facial flushing, throbbing headache, tachycardia, and shortness of breath all occurred. The symptoms abated within a few hours with no sequelae but could be re-provoked by further alcohol consumption up to 48 h later. This syndrome appears to be identical with the one known from C. atramentarius. However, the toxin in L. aspera or its mechanism is not yet known.

### Increasing incidence of mycotoxicosis in south-Eastern Germany: a comprehensive analysis of mushroom poisonings at a university medical center [^111cHwFS]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Mushrooms, classified as eukaryotic organisms, have been integral to human nutrition and medicinal practices since ancient times, valued for their culinary attributes and therapeutic properties. Globally, an estimated 100,000 species of mushrooms exist, with their prevalence varying according to seasonal, meteorological, and regional factors. The temporal onset of symptoms post-consumption is a critical factor, with early manifestation (< 6 h) typically correlating with more favorable prognoses than delayed presentations.

Initial symptoms of toxicity often involve the gastrointestinal system, manifesting as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting, potentially escalating to multi-organ failure, particularly affecting liver and kidneys. Mushroom-induced syndromes can be categorized into six distinct groups: cytotoxic, neurotoxic, myotoxic, metabolic/endocrine poisonings, gastrointestinal irritants, and miscellaneous adverse reactions. The most perilous intoxication in Europe is attributed to the consumption of the death cap (Amanita phalloides). This mushroom contains cyclopeptide compounds, notably Amatoxins, which are heat-resistant bicyclic octapeptides. The lethal dose for adults is approximately 0.1 mg/kg body weight, underscoring the high risk associated with even minimal consumption.

Intoxication from A. phalloides unfolds in three stages, beginning with severe gastrointestinal distress (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) following a latency of 6–24 h. This is succeeded, within 12–48 h, by cytolytic hepatitis marked by elevated liver enzymes and hepatic apoptosis. Progressing liver and renal failure typically develop after 24–72 h, accompanied by coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and nephropathy. The primary toxins involved are α-Amanitin and Phallotoxines, the former being resistant to digestive enzymes and readily absorbed, inhibiting the RNA-Polymerase II subunit RPB1 in a p53- and caspase-3-dependent manner, leading to halted DNA-to-mRNA transcription, and consequently, apoptosis and necrosis in hepatocytes and kidneys. The recirculation of α-Amanitin in the enterohepatic system prolongs its presence in the body.

### Survival following investigational treatment of amanita mushroom poisoning: thistle or shamrock? [^1134XypY]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

We report the first case, to our knowledge, of amatoxin hepatotoxicity in Iowa and explore the ethical and decisional challenges of offering an investigational treatment of a rare disease. Acute liver failure due to ingestion of amatoxin-containing mushrooms is a relatively rare entity. Once amatoxin poisoning is identified, there is no clearly effective treatment, leading to a broad range of theoretically beneficial, anecdotally successful, or investigational options. The evolution of hepatotoxicity led us to offer investigational treatment with silibinin, an extract of Mediterranean milk thistle. We explore the pitfalls in medical decision-making experienced by both the patient and the physician in the face of ambiguity. The patient did well following silibinin infusion, but we are left uncertain as to whether the patient truly responded to treatment or was simply destined to recover.

### Acute liver failure guidelines [^112KrvH8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Acute liver failure — management of mushroom toxicity: The poison control center should be contacted for guidance, gastric lavage is recommended within 1 hour of toxin ingestion, and activated charcoal is also recommended soon after ingestion with doses of 50 g every 4 hours or 25 g every 2 hours that can be reduced to 12.5 g every hour; up to 60%–80% of amatoxins are filtered through the kidneys, and IV hydration to maintain urinary output of 100–200 mL/hr for up to 4–5 days is recommended; within the first 24 hours, patients should receive IV silibinin dihemisuccinate at 20–50 mg/kg/d for 48–96 hours or alternatively 5 mg/kg/d over 1 hour, followed by 20 mg/kg/d for 6 days or until the serum transaminases normalize.

### Amatoxin poisoning: case reports and review of current therapies [^115h5gbY]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnosis and management of Amanita mushroom poisoning is a challenging problem for physicians across the United States. With 5902 mushroom exposures and two resultant deaths directly linked to Amanita ingestion in 2009, it is difficult for physicians to determine which patients are at risk for lethal toxicity. Identification of amatoxin poisoning can prove to be difficult due to delay in onset of symptoms and difficulty with identification of mushrooms. Consequently, it is difficult for the Emergency Physician to determine proper disposition. Further, treatment options are controversial.

Objectives

To review current data to help health care providers effectively identify and treat potentially deadly Amanita mushroom ingestions.

Case Reports

We present two cases of Amanita mushroom ingestion in the northeastern United States treated with N-acetylcysteine, high-dose penicillin, cimetidine, and silibinin, a semi-purified fraction of milk thistle-derived silymarin, as part of their treatment regimen. The mushroom species was identified by a consultant as Amanita Ocreata.

Conclusions

We present the successful treatment of 2 patients who ingested what we believe to be an Amanita species never before identified in the northeastern United States.

### Amanita phalloides mushroom poisonings-Northern California, December 2016 [^111DbLnE]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

In California, A. phalloides species grow in a symbiotic relationship with coast live oak and other hardwood trees. They can be especially abundant in the early wet winter months, though the foggy coastal climate and warmer temperatures can support mushroom growth throughout the year. In 2016, local mycologists noted an abundance of wild mushroom growth, and California county health departments reported an increase in the incidence of mushroom poisoning. Although weather conditions and increased numbers of A. phalloides poisonings do not prove a cause and effect relationship, early seasonal rainfall and warmer subsequent temperatures made a substantial contribution to mushroom proliferation. In addition, a general increase in naïve foraging and wildcrafting (i.e.g.athering plant material from its native environment for food or medicinal purposes) activities raises risk for poisoning.

Mycologists recommend exercising caution when foraging or purchasing wild mushrooms for consumption. If wild mushrooms are to be consumed, specimens should first be examined, identified, and deemed edible by an experienced mycologist. Prompt identification of mushroom-related toxic symptoms in the ED and early, aggressive IV volume replacement are critical first steps in diminishing the significant morbidity and mortality associated with amatoxin ingestion. Antidotal therapies might also be considered in conjunction with a consultant experienced in hepatotoxic mushroom poisoning. In patients with severe poisoning, early contact with the nearest liver transplant center is recommended. Response to this outbreak included the notification of the local counties and state department of public health, which subsequently issued a widely distributed press release. Measures to disseminate information regarding the dangers of A. phalloides ingestion are ongoing.

### Amatoxin-containing mushroom poisonings: species, toxidromes, treatments, and outcomes [^116WHmE1]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Amatoxins are produced primarily by 3 species of mushrooms: Amanita, Lepiota, and Galerina. Because amatoxin poisonings are increasing, the objective of this review was to identify all amatoxin-containing mushroom species, present a toxidromic approach to earlier diagnoses, and compare the efficacies and outcomes of therapies. To meet these objectives, Internet search engines were queried with keywords to select peer-reviewed scientific articles on amatoxin-containing mushroom poisoning and management. Descriptive epidemiological analyses have documented that most mushroom poisonings are caused by unknown mushrooms, and most fatal mushroom poisonings are caused by amatoxin-containing mushrooms. Amanita species cause more fatal mushroom poisonings than other amatoxin-containing species, such as Galerina and Lepiota. Amanita phalloides is responsible for most fatalities, followed by Amanita virosa and Amanita verna. The most frequently reported fatal Lepiota ingestions are due to Lepiota brunneoincarnata, and the most frequently reported fatal Galerina species ingestions are due to Galerina marginata. With the exception of liver transplantation, the current treatment strategies for amatoxin poisoning are all supportive and have not been subjected to rigorous efficacy testing in randomized controlled trials. All patients with symptoms of late-appearing gastrointestinal toxicity with or without false recovery or quiescent periods preceding acute liver insufficiency should be referred to centers providing liver transplantation. Patients with amatoxin-induced acute liver insufficiency that does not progress to liver failure will have a more favorable survival profile with supportive care than patients with amatoxin-induced acute liver failure, about half of whom will require liver transplantation.

### Toxicology in the ICU: part 1: general overview and approach to treatment [^116XyaPe]. Chest (2011). Low credibility.

Poisonings, adverse drug effects, and envenomations continue to be commonly encountered. Patients often present critically ill and warrant ICU admission. Many other patients who are initially stable have the potential for rapid deterioration and require continuous cardiopulmonary and neurologic monitoring. Given the potential for rapid deterioration, and because patients need continuous monitoring, ICU admission is frequently required. This article is the first of a three-part series to be published in CHEST; it discusses general management, laboratory tests, enhanced elimination, and emerging therapies. The second article will address the management of specific overdoses; the last will cover plants, mushrooms, envenomations, and heavy metals.

### Laboratory confirmation of amanita smithiana mushroom poisoning [^1118sUfJ]. Clinical Toxicology (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Here we present a case of Amanita smithiana poisoning resulting in acute kidney injury requiring dialysis, and highlight laboratory methods used to confirm the diagnosis. Identification of Amanita smithiana toxin using thin-layer chromatography can provide greater diagnostic certainty than history and renal function tests alone.

Case Details

A 63-year-old male presented to hospital with anuria and gastrointestinal symptoms, two days after consuming a soup of wild mushrooms he had picked. He was found to be in acute renal failure, requiring hemodialysis. After nine days of supportive treatment, he recovered renal function, and was discharged in good health 15 days post-ingestion. The patient provided a sample of leftover soup, and examination of cooked mushroom fragments by a mycologist provided preliminary identification of A. smithiana. Thin-layer chromatography revealed the presence of A. smithiana toxin in the soup, confirming this identification.

Discussion

A. smithiana is a nephrotoxic mushroom that can be easily mistaken for the edible and highly prized Pine mushroom (Tricholoma magnivelare). It causes initial gastrointestinal symptoms, followed by acute renal failure. Treatment includes dialysis and supportive care until the patient recovers renal function. The chemical structure of the A. smithiana toxin is unknown, but it can be identified as a characteristic spot on thin-layer chromatography.

### Notes from the field: acute intoxications from consumption of amanita muscaria mushrooms-Minnesota, 2018 [^1152Svxt]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

A. muscaria mushrooms can contain ibotenic acid and muscimol, which are structurally similar to glutamate and gamma-Aminobutyric acid, respectively; ibotenic acid is capable of producing central nervous system excitation (e.g. hallucinations, agitation, or seizures), and muscimol causes central nervous system depression. Ingestion of A. muscaria can also cause gastrointestinal symptoms. An Internet search revealed multiple recipes by avid foragers for A. muscaria reported as safe for consumption; however, A. muscaria toxins might not be deactivated by cooking.

In 2006, an outbreak occurred among two Hmong † families in Minnesota who consumed Amanita bisporigera; this mushroom produces amatoxin, which is associated with gastrointestinal distress, liver failure, and high mortality. The outbreak affected nine persons and resulted in one death. Outreach efforts were focused on Hmong residents, including new arrivals in Minnesota.

Although the A. muscaria mushroom consumed by the patient in this report did not contain amatoxin, the event underscored that mushroom intoxications continue to be a concern for newly arrived persons accustomed to foraging in their home countries, who might not be familiar with local mushroom ecology. Because some local toxic mushrooms might resemble edible mushrooms found in Southeast Asia, MDH reached out to the Karen Organization of Minnesota and sought to identify additional mushroom intoxication cases, increase awareness among community leaders, and initiate community messaging about potential dangers of wild mushroom foraging. No additional mushroom intoxication cases were identified. Newly arrived persons might benefit from education concerning dangers associated with and the importance of avoiding consumption of wild mushrooms.

### The family and the fungi: a case series depicting toxic mushroom ingestion affecting a family of eight [^116v7Pif]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Most mushroom exposures are benign and rare, with approximately 7400 yearly exposures. Of these, less than 1% of annual exposures can be attributed to cyclopeptide-containing mushrooms, amatoxins, and phallotoxins, with improved outcomes with early recognition. Notably, toxic ingestion of Amanita genus mushrooms is a rare but notable cause of acute liver failure. Approximately 95% of deaths worldwide associated with mushroom ingestion have been caused by amatoxin, the causative agent found in these mushrooms.

Case Series

We present a case series involving eight family members, aged 8–44 years old, who shared a meal of these mushrooms foraged from the greater Northeast Philadelphia area. These individuals developed symptoms 8 hours postingestion and presented to the emergency department 16 hours postingestion. Three of them developed acute liver injury, and all recovered without the need for liver transplantation. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? These cases required a great deal of resources, including uncommonly utilized medications, active resuscitation, a thorough timeline investigation, and complex collaboration with pediatrics, toxicology, and a liver transplant-capable center. This community hospital involved logistical and supply challenges, including limited emergency department space, depletion of activated charcoal, and appropriate disposition despite relatively benign presentation.

### Timing of liver transplantation for pediatric acute liver failure due to mushroom poisoning: a case report and literature review [^112SR527]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

After the toxin enters the intestinal tract, amatoxin binds to DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II, inhibits protein synthesis, and induces the production of cytokines, ultimately resulting in the death of hepatocytes. The clinical course of amatoxin poisoning is classically divided into four consecutive phases. (1) Asymptomatic Phases. There are no symptoms and signs at this stage, and it lasts generally 6–40 h after ingestion with an average of about 10 h. (2) Gastrointestinal Phase. This phase is characterized by nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dehydration etc. It lasts for 12–24 h. At this time, the patient's liver function and renal function are normal. If the doctor does not get the history of mushroom ingestion, it is easy to be misdiagnosed as gastroenteritis. (3) Latent Hepatic Phase. It occurs 36–48 h after ingestion. Although gastrointestinal symptoms are significantly improved, the performance of liver involvement is gradually obvious, jaundice, transaminases and bilirubin increase. Renal function is involved. (4) Acute Liver Failure Phase. This stage is characterized by progressive deterioration of liver function (hyperbilirubinemia, coagulation dysfunction, hepatic encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome). If liver failure progresses irreversibly, multiple organ failure and death usually occur within 1–3 weeks after ingestion. The spontaneous survival rate of patients with mushroom poisoning causing acute liver injury or ALF is between 33.8% and 55.6%. ALF is characterized by apoptosis or necrosis of the parenchymal cells. The clinical manifestations and pathology of this case are consistent with those of typical mushroom poisoning.

There is no specific antidote to amatoxin. The common therapies include gastric lavage, multidose activated charcoal, cimetidine, penicillin G, silybin, and N-acetylcysteine. Artificial liver support systems are also used in some centers. However, due to the lack of randomized controlled trials, these methods have not been proven effective. When these treatments fail, LT is the only lifesaving option. Although transplantation has substantially improved the short-term survival rate, long-term rates are still lower than those of other indications. This may be due to the lack of long-term follow-up data because of a relatively recently introduction of PLT. The liver has the potential for spontaneous recovery, and some patients with PALF can survive without LT. Therefore, the specific criteria and optimal timing of LT remain to be determined.

### Current fatality rate of suspected cyclopeptide mushroom poisoning in the United States [^113S4HoY]. Clinical Toxicology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study was designed to determine the fatality rate of suspected cyclopeptide-containing mushroom ingestions reported to the National Poison Data System (NPDS).

Background

Although silibinin reportedly improves survival in suspected cyclopeptide-containing mushroom ingestions, the greater than 20% untreated fatality rate that is often cited is based on decades-old data. An ongoing open-label silibinin trial will likely use historical cases as comparators. A recent single poison control center (PCC) study showed a fatality rate of 8.3%. This study was designed to validate those findings in the NPDS.

Methods

This study was an 11-year (1/1/2008–12/31/2018) retrospective review of suspected cyclopeptide-containing mushroom ingestions reported to NPDS. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were the same as the ongoing silibinin trial: Age > 2-years-old; history of eating foraged mushrooms; gastrointestinal symptoms within 48h of mushroom ingestion; and aminotransferases above the upper limit of normal within 48h after ingestion. Each original participating PCC confirmed eligibility, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome on included cases.

Results

During the study period, 8,953 mushroom exposures were reported to NPDS, of which 296 met inclusion criteria. The PCC survey response rate was 60% (28/47 PCCs), and the individual case response rate was 59% (174/296). Twenty-six cases were subsequently excluded leaving 148 included cases. The overall mortality rate was 8.8% (13/148). Mortality in silibinin/silymarin-treated vs untreated cases was 9.5% (4/42), vs 8.5% (9/106), respectively. A mycologist identified mushrooms in 16.9% of cases (25/148), of which 80% (20/25) were cyclopeptide-containing. Among these confirmed cases, the mortality rate was 10% (1/10) in both silibinin/silymarin-treated and untreated cases.

Conclusions

The contemporary mortality rate of patients with presumed cyclopeptide-mushroom poisoning is only 8.8%. This likely represents improved supportive care for patients with acute liver injury and should be considered the current standard for historical controls in the United States.

### Amanita phalloides mushroom poisonings-Northern California, December 2016 [^116GAkEN]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Over the course of 2 weeks in December 2016, CPCS investigated 14 suspected A. phalloides ingestions in five northern California counties. Eleven patients recovered, although three required liver transplants because of irreversible fulminant hepatic failure. One of those patients, a child, developed cerebral edema and suffered permanent neurologic sequelae.

Amatoxins, consisting of alpha, beta, and gamma amanitin, account for > 90% of deaths related to mushroom poisoning worldwide. A. phalloides contains the alpha variety of amanitin, a cyclic octapeptide thought to be the primary agent of toxicity in humans. The amanitins are heat stable and are not inactivated by cooking. Once ingested, amatoxin is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract into the portal circulation where it is taken up by hepatocytes, binding to DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (II) and halting intracellular protein synthesis, ultimately resulting in cell death. A lethal dose can be as low as 0.1 mg/kg, and a single mushroom can contain up to 15 mg. The clinical course of amatoxin poisoning is described in three phases: delayed gastroenteritis with significant body fluid volume loss (after a postingestion latency of 6–24 hours), symptomatic recovery (24–36 hours after ingestion), and fulminant hepatic and multiorgan failure (typically 3–5 days after the ingestion). Patients who are evaluated early in the course of their illness might be discharged home only to return later with indications of liver failure, contributing to the relatively high case fatality rate (10%–20%). Initial treatment emphasizes early supportive care including aggressive fluid and electrolyte replacement. In the event of irreversible fulminant liver failure, liver transplant might be required. A variety of therapies including multidose activated charcoal, high-dose penicillin, N-acetylcysteine, cimetidine, biliary drainage, and octreotide have been attempted with no definitive evidence of efficacy. Uncontrolled observational studies of Amanita intoxication suggest that the early use of silibinin, a milk thistle derivative, is associated with a reduction in mortality when compared with historical controls; however, as with the other aforementioned therapies, evidence supporting efficacy is lacking because of difficulties associated with conducting randomized controlled trials. Intravenous silibinin is licensed in Europe, and a clinical trial to evaluate its efficacy in treatment of hepatic failure induced by Amanita mushroom poisoning is currently underway in the United States. § The majority of silibinin-treated patients in this report received the drug as participants of this trial. Medical providers should contact the regional poison control center or a medical toxicology consultant to assist in the management of any patient with suspected amatoxic mushroom ingestion.

### Two cases of severe amanita muscaria poisoning including a fatality [^115pG7q7]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Ingestion of Amanita muscaria mushrooms results in transient central nervous system excitation and depression mediated by its components, ibotenic acid and muscimol. The mushroom is distributed worldwide and ingestions occur with some frequency. Although these ingestions have traditionally been considered benign, serious complications can occur. We present 2 cases of serious toxicity, including a fatality. The first case was a 44-y-old man who presented to the emergency department (ED) after cardiopulmonary arrest approximately 10 h after ingesting 4 to 5 dried A muscaria mushroom caps, which he used for their mind-altering effects. Despite successful resuscitation, he remained unresponsive and hypotensive and died 9 days later. The second case was a 75-y-old man who presented to the ED after accidentally consuming one large A muscaria mushroom cap he foraged in Eastern Turkey. The patient initially presented to the ED with hallucinations followed by lethargy, and he was intubated for airway protection. The patient's condition gradually improved, and he made a full recovery. A muscaria ingestion should not be considered benign as serious outcomes do occur. An understanding of how the main neuroactive chemicals, ibotenic acid and muscimol, affect the brain can help anticipate outcomes. Several high-risk features that portend a more serious course are identified.

### Type I autoimmune hepatitis presenting with acute liver failure in the setting of wild mushroom ingestion [^112geyfT]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Type I autoimmune hepatitis usually has an indolent presentation and course, and is classically thought of as a disease of young women, but can in fact occur across all age ranges. Although its etiology remains unclear, it is hypothesized that an environmental antigen may trigger the disease in a genetically susceptible individual. Here, we report the unusual case of a woman in her seventh decade who presented with acute liver failure as her initial manifestation of autoimmune hepatitis, and who had been a long-time ingestor of hand-picked, wild mushrooms.

### Molecular identification offrom patient vomit specimens in mushroom poisoning [^115RsHo5]. Clinical Toxicology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Mushroom poisoning remains a global public health challenge, with morphological identification accuracy limited to 17%. This study aimed to demonstrate molecular identification from vomit specimens in a patient with mushroom poisoning.

Methods

Following a mushroom poisoning incident in Yamagata Prefecture, Japan (September 2018), we collected four vomit specimens from a female patient. Deoxyribonucleic acid analysis targeting the internal transcribed spacer region using polymerase chain reaction and sequencing was performed on three of four specimens, while liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry or toxin quantification was conducted on all four specimens. Species identification was conducted through sequence homology analysis.

Results

Polymerase chain reaction amplification of the 185 base pair target sequence was successful from three vomit specimens collected 7h post-ingestion, yielding identical sequences. Sequence analysis identified Amanita ibotengutake (100% homology), contradicting the initial morphological identification of Amanita pantherina. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry detected a total of 0.053mg ibotenic acid and 0.0043mg muscimol in vomit specimens, consistent with the patient's neurological symptoms.

Discussions

The discrepancy between morphological (Amanita pantherina) and molecular (Amanita ibotengutake) identification demonstrates limitations of conventional methods, particularly significant as these species were considered identical until 2002. Successful deoxyribonucleic acid amplification 7h post-ingestion, despite technical challenges from gastric degradation, suggests clinical feasibility. This integrated molecular-toxicological approach strengthens scientific understanding of species-specific toxicities and contributes to improved epidemiological investigation of mushroom poisoning.

Conclusions

We report the successful molecular identification from patient vomit specimens in a patient with mushroom poisoning. Although limited to a single case, this methodology may contribute to strengthening mushroom poisoning reports in the scientific literature to improve understanding of species-specific toxicities. Further validation in additional cases is needed for broader scientific applications.

### Amatoxin-containing mushroom (lepiota brunneoincarnata) familial poisoning [^111txHp3]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

Serious to fatal toxicity may occur with amanitin-containing mushrooms ingestions. A Lepiota brunneoincarnata familial poisoning with hepatic toxicity is reported. In such poisonings, acute gastroenteritis may be firstly misdiagnosed leading to delay in preventing liver dysfunction by silibinin or penicillin G. Mushroom picking finally requires experience and caution.

### Mycetism: a review of the recent literature [^112zxd5P]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2014). Low credibility.

Approximately 100 of the known species of mushrooms are poisonous to humans. New toxic mushroom species continue to be identified. Some species initially classified as edible are later reclassified as toxic. This results in a continually expanding list of toxic mushrooms. As new toxic species are identified, some classic teachings about mycetism no longer hold true. As more toxic mushrooms are identified and more toxic syndromes are reported, older classification systems fail to effectively accommodate mycetism. This review provides an update of myscetism and classifies mushroom poisonings by the primary organ system affected, permitting expansion, as new, toxic mushroom species are discovered.

### Increasing incidence of mycotoxicosis in south-Eastern Germany: a comprehensive analysis of mushroom poisonings at a university medical center [^117BFjb9]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Identifying toxic versus inedible mushrooms

Our data documents nine different mushroom types, illustrating the diagnostic diversity. Two primary challenges exist: accurate mushroom identification and differentiation between inedible and poisonous varieties. Mushroom collectors believe often that they can identify the mushroom correctly. However, misidentification is the most common cause of intoxications. The former often requires consulting local mycological experts, while the latter is complicated by similar early symptoms across various species. Apart from psychotropic mushrooms and Psilocybin, all documented types induced gastrointestinal symptoms, a common early sign of death cap (Amanita phalloides) ingestion. Therefore, patients presenting with such symptoms during mushroom season should be questioned about mushroom consumption. Laboratory parameters like transaminases and creatinine are critical for differential diagnosis. The study generally did not pursue toxicological verification in biological samples due to the limited availability of specific laboratory tests for various fungal toxins.

Plasmapheresis in clinical management

The non-transplant treatment options for patients with acute liver failure are very limited. Therapeutic plasma exchange is the only treatment shown to improve survival rates in these patients. In cases of liver failure leading to coagulopathy, plasmapheresis has proven effective in mitigating severe bleeding risks. A study on children with acute liver failure demonstrated an improvement in biochemical profiles. It showed that initiating plasmapheresis in the early stages of acute liver failure reduces the acute inflammatory response and can increase the likelihood of recovery. An elimination of the poison by plasmapheresis is not possible. We observed improved liver function and normalized coagulation parameters following plasmapheresis, demonstrating its utility as a "bridge to recovery" (Fig. 5). Additionally, in cases where liver transplantation is imminent, plasmapheresis can be instrumental in managing coagulation failure and maintaining patient stability, serving as a bridge to recovery or as a temporizing measure until transplantation becomes possible.

### Health care utilization and outcomes associated with accidental poisonous mushroom ingestions-United States, 2016–2018 [^115uwjDc]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

This analysis demonstrates the potential for serious adverse outcomes in young children, although they occurred less frequently than in older persons. Young children might take small, exploratory bites of mushrooms during outdoor play; older persons might be more likely to consume larger quantities of mushrooms as food or to achieve a hallucinogenic effect. Studies have documented serious adverse outcomes related to poisonous mushroom ingestions in young children, including liver failure and permanent neurologic impairment. The public should be aware that children should be supervised when playing outside in areas where mushrooms might grow, and children should not be fed wild mushrooms unless the mushrooms are identified by experts.

Previous studies have found that patients with Medicaid are less likely to use poison control centers in general, potentially resulting in higher rates of unnecessary ED visits, preventable adverse outcomes, and costly hospitalizations from accidental poisonings. The reasons for more frequent adverse outcomes from poisonous mushroom ingestions in Medicaid-insured patients merits further study. Medicaid patients might benefit from targeted public health messaging regarding mushroom poisonings.

The findings in this report are subject to at least six limitations. First, HCUP data do not allow patient-level analyses, and the MarketScan databases represent a large convenience sample. Second, using both types of data sources (HCUP and MarketScan) permitted examination of the national prevalence of mushroom poisoning and analysis of patient characteristics; however, these administrative data sets are subject to inconsistent ICD-10-CM coding and misclassification. Third, because race and ethnicity data were unavailable for patients with commercial insurance in the MarketScan database, outcome comparison by race and ethnicity was not possible for most patients in the analysis. Fourth, the broad age groups of patients compared in the MarketScan databases did not distinguish between older children and adults; to address this limitation, analyses were repeated using more discrete age categorizations, and the frequency of serious adverse events was lower in children aged ≤ 5 years compared with all other age groups. Fifth, information about deaths was not available. Finally, because many poisonous mushroom ingestions are likely not reported, this report might underestimate the actual public health effects of poisonous mushroom ingestion.

### Evolving global epidemiology, syndromic classification, general management, and prevention of unknown mushroom poisonings [^115Zp8FA]. Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the evolving global epidemiology of mushroom poisoning and to identify new and emerging mushroom poisonings and their treatments, a descriptive analysis and review of the world's salient scientific literature on mushroom poisoning was conducted.

Data Source

Data sources from observation studies conducted over the period 1959–2002 and describing 28,018 mushroom poisonings since 1951 were collected from case reports, case series, regional descriptive studies, meta-analyses, and laboratory studies of mushroom poisonings and the toxicokinetics of mycotoxins.

Study Selection

Studies included in the review were selected by a MEDLINE search, 1966–2004, an Ovid OLDMEDLINE search, 1951–1965, and a medical library search for sources published before 1951.

Data Extraction

To better guide clinicians in establishing diagnoses and implementing therapies, despite confusing ingestion histories, data were extracted to permit an expanded syndromic classification of mushroom poisoning based on presentation timing and target organ systemic toxicity.

Data Synthesis

The final 14 major syndromes of mushroom poisoning were stratified first by presentation timing and then by target organ systemic toxicity and included early (< 6 hrs), late (6–24 hrs), and delayed syndromes (≥ 1 day). There were eight early syndromes (four neurotoxic, two gastrointestinal, two allergic); three late syndromes (hepatotoxic, accelerated nephrotoxic, erythromelalgia); and three delayed syndromes (delayed nephrotoxic, delayed neurotoxic, rhabdomyolysis). Four new mushroom poisoning syndromes were classified including accelerated nephrotoxicity (Amanita proxima, Amanita smithiana), rhabdomyolysis (Tricholoma equestre, Russula subnigricans), erythromelalgia (Clitocybe amoenolens, Clitocybe acromelalgia), and delayed neurotoxicity (Hapalopilus rutilans). In addition, data sources were stratified by three chronological time periods with > 1,000 confirmed mushroom ingestions reported and tested for any statistically significant secular trends in case fatalities from mushroom ingestions over the entire study period, 1951–2002.

Conclusions

Since the 1950s, reports of severe and fatal mushroom poisonings have increased worldwide. Clinicians must consider mushroom poisoning in the evaluation of all patients who may be intoxicated by natural substances. Since information on natural exposures is often insufficient and incorrect, a new syndromic classification of mushroom poisoning is recommended to guide clinicians in making earlier diagnoses, especially in cases where only advanced critical care, including organ transplantation, may be life saving.

### Mushroom poisoning – from diarrhea to liver transplantation [^1159stgR]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Mushroom poisoning from the genus Amanita is a medical emergency, with Amanita phalloides being the most common species. The typical symptoms of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea are nonspecific and can be mistaken for gastroenteritis. If not adequately treated, hepatic and renal failure may ensue within several days of ingestion. In this case series, patients poisoned with Amanita virosa are described with a spectrum of clinical presentations and outcomes ranging from complete recovery to fulminant hepatic failure. Although there are no controlled clinical trials, a few anecdotal studies provide the basis for regimens recommended to treat Amanita poisoning. Use of i.v. penicillin G is supported by most reports. Silibinin, although preferred over penicillin, is not easily available in the United States. In those with acute liver failure, liver transplantation can be life saving.

### Acute liver failure guidelines [^111uETEQ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Key concepts and recommendation for mushroom poisoning–related acute liver failure — "In patients presenting with mushroom poisoning and acute liver injury, Escudie criteria can be used to predict the need for LT even before the development of encephalopathy". Early decontamination is stated: "Gastric lavage and activated charcoal should be administered within the first few hours after ingestion, provided no contraindications exist". Recommendation: "In patients with ALF due to mushroom poisoning, we recommend initiation of IV silibinin as soon as possible. IV penicillin G may be used if IV silibinin is unavailable. GRADE recommendation: conditional, very low quality of evidence".

### Activated charcoal for acute poisoning: one toxicologist's journey [^113hPVyB]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Greene proposes the following criteria for oral administration of AC: (1) the ingestion is potentially toxic, (2) there are no contraindications to use of AC, (3) the substance is adsorbed by AC, (4) the substance is likely to still be in the GI tract when AC is given, (5) the patient is expected to be able to maintain a patent airway or is already intubated, and(6) the GI tract is functionally and anatomically intact; and there is no safer or more effective alternate treatment. Bailey pictures a risk-benefit "gastrointestinal triangle" whose three corners are (1) the hazard posed by the ingestion, (2) the potential benefit of gastrointestinal decontamination, and (3) the risks of the procedure. Wiegand designed an algorithm incorporating the risk of aspiration, the potential toxicity of the substance, and the time since ingestion. The algorithm (presented in abstract form but not yet published in full) calls for administration of AC up to 4 h after ingestion of potentially toxic substances or up to 24 h in special circumstances: e.g. the drug is probably still present in the stomach (e.g. massive ingestion, anticholinergic, and salicylate); the poisoning could be lethal despite supportive care; a very large ingestion requiring multiple doses of AC to achieve a 10:1 AC/drug ratio; or ingestion of drug packets ("body packer" or "stuffer"). Wiegand's list of potentially lethal drugs includes cardiotoxic agents such as calcium channel blockers and chloroquine; cytotoxic agents such as amatoxin-containing mushrooms, colchicine, and chemotherapeutic agents; and other menacing poisons such as paraquat.

### Anaphylactoid reactions to acetylcysteine treatment in wild mushroom poisoning patients in yunnan, China [^113WiuWb]. Clinical Toxicology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Affiliated Hospital of Yunnan University, serving as the Poisoning Treatment Center of Yunnan Province, receives nearly all patients with wild mushroom poisoning requiring emergency treatment. We anecdotally observed a higher incidence of anaphylactoid reactions in patients admitted to our hospital for wild mushroom poisoning who received acetylcysteine.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 1, 2023, to August 31, 2024. The study included patients who received intravenous acetylcysteine. Patients were divided into two groups: the exposure group comprised patients with wild mushroom poisoning, while the comparison group included patients receiving acetylcysteine for other indications. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of anaphylactoid reactions. Subgroup analyses were performed for sex, age, weight, dose, history of allergies, total bilirubin concentration, alanine aminotransferase activity, aspartate aminotransferase activity, gamma-glutamyl transferase activity, alkaline phosphatase activity, prothrombin time, and the fastest rate of acetylcysteine infusion.

Results

One-hundred and ten patients were included: 20 with wild mushroom poisoning and 90 without. Patients with wild mushroom poisoning exhibited a significantly higher risk of anaphylactoid reactions (OR: 5.43; 95% CI: 1.63–18.13). Symptoms of anaphylactoid reactions were typically mild. Additionally, female gender (OR: 3.49; 95% CI: 1.02–11.95) and history of allergies (OR: 3.82; 95% CI: 1.11–13.20) were identified as independent risk factors. A predictive model combining these factors showed good performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.88; 95% CI: 0.81–0.95).

Discussion

A possible reason for this phenomenon is the presence of various trace mineral elements in wild mushrooms, which exhibit higher bioavailability when mushrooms are not cooked fully. Accumulated mineral elements in wild mushroom poisoning patients bind with acetylcysteine, forming substances that cause anaphylactoid reactions.

Conclusions

Patients with wild mushroom poisoning appear to be at an increased risk of anaphylactoid reactions during intravenous acetylcysteine administration compared to those who did not consume wild mushrooms.

### Identification of indocyanine green as a STT3B inhibitor against mushroom α-amanitin cytotoxicity [^116eeiKS]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Mushroom poisoning is the main cause of mortality in food poisoning incidents worldwide. A total of 10,036 exposure events, resulting in 38,676 illnesses and 788 deaths, were reported between 2010 and 2020 in China. Among all poisonous mushrooms, death caps (Amanita phalloides) are responsible for more than 90% of death. Amatoxin poisoning is commonly associated with poor outcomes, mainly owing to the irreparable acute failure of the liver or kidney.

α-Amanitin (AMA) is one of the most toxic amatoxins. The toxic effects of AMA on humans are considered to be associated with the inhibition of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II), leading to the production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Traditional therapies are often limited to the non-specific decontamination of toxins along with symptomatic and supportive care. During the past decades, several clinical drugs including silybin and penicillin have shown potent therapeutic efficacy on human amatoxin poisoning, although the exact mechanisms of action remain unclear. Moreover, polymyxin B, identified as a potential RNAP II inhibitor in a virtual docking, has been shown to block AMA toxicity in mice. However, specific antidotes targeting specific proteins that play critical roles in AMA toxicity are unavailable since a complete molecular understanding of AMA cytotoxicity is lacking.

The family friend (patient F) visited an ED 2 days after ingestion of the mushrooms, complaining of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. On hospital day 1, her LFTs peaked at AST 11,940, ALT 11,350, and INR 4.5. She was treated with aggressive IV fluid hydration, IV octreotide, and IV silibinin. Her hepatic function recovered, and she was discharged home on hospital day 6.

Additional cases. In the subsequent 2 weeks, CPCS was notified of eight additional cases of acute liver injury after consumption of wild mushrooms in northern California counties (Table). One case involved a man aged 36 years who had ingested mushrooms, later confirmed to be A. phalloides, obtained from a friend who picked them during a hike. Another case occurred in a man aged 56 years who was evaluated at an ED 2 days after ingestion of foraged mushrooms and required a liver transplant; two cases occurred in women aged 86 and 93 years who received wild-picked mushrooms from a friend; and four men aged 19–22 years who developed hepatotoxicity after ingesting what they thought were psychedelic mushrooms picked from the wild. Most of these patients had recovery of hepatic function.

### An outbreak of-like (galerina cf. sulciceps) mushroom poisoning [^115afDsH]. Clinical Toxicology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Amatoxin-containing mushroom poisoning is a significant threat to public health worldwide. We report a mass poisoning of Galerina sulciceps -like mushrooms (Galerina cf. sulciceps) in Luzhou, Sichuan Province, China, aiming to offer insights for future prevention and treatment strategies.

Methods

We performed a retrospective survey of mass mushroom poisoning patients admitted to our hospital. The demographic data, clinical presentations, laboratory findings, therapeutic measures and prognostic information were collected and analyzed. We used the 2020 Chinese consensus on the clinical diagnosis and treatment of amatoxin-containing mushroom poisoning to assess the severity of poisoning. Mushrooms were examined through morphological analysis, molecular biology identification, and toxin detection.

Results

Our patient cohort consisted of nine males and six females, with mean (± SD) age of 34.9 ± 13.0years. Gastrointestinal symptoms were the first to manifest, with mean (± SD) latency period of 13.4 ± 3.9h. The majority of patients (86.7%) experienced nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Liver dysfunction was noted in 66.7% of patients, and thrombocytopenia was present in 26.7% of patients. In terms of the severity of poisoning, there were 10 mild cases and five severe cases. The mushrooms were provisionally labeled as Galerina cf. sulciceps, containing the toxins α-amanitin, β-amanitin, and γ-amanitin. All patients eventually recovered.

Discussion

We report what appears to be a new type of mushroom that is morphologically and phylogenetically similar to the known Galerina sulciceps, but further study is required to determine if it represents a distinct species.

Conclusion

This poisoning event was caused by unintentional ingestion of Galerina cf. sulciceps, an amatoxin-containing mushroom. Early symptoms are primarily gastrointestinal, with acute liver damage and coagulopathy being the main toxic effects. Thrombocytopenia is also prominent, particularly in severe cases. Accurate assessment and prompt, individualized, and intensive treatment are crucial for managing patients with acute Galerina cf. sulciceps poisoning effectively.

Established therapies include N-Acetylcysteine, Penicillin G, and Silibinin. Silibinin, derived from the milk thistle (Silybum marianum), impedes the OATP1B3 transporter, thus blocking amanitin uptake into hepatocytes, and simultaneously promotes structural protein regeneration and enhances oxidative stress resistance (Fig. 1). Penicillin G, acting as a competitive substrate for OATP1B3, also inhibits amanitin uptake. N-Acetylcysteine, known for its use in acetaminophen poisoning, leverages its antioxidative properties in combating death cap (Amanita phalloides) intoxication. In the liver, it metabolizes to cysteine, which assists in glutathione synthesis, thereby mitigating apoptosis and inflammation. Mouse model studies have shown a decrease in leukocyte infiltration in hepatocytes following N-Acetylcysteine administration. Current consensus suggests that Silibinin, either alone or in combination with N-Acetylcysteine, is the most effective treatment modality.

Fig. 1
Impact of Amatoxins on Hepatocytes: Amatoxins specifically inhibit RNA polymerase II, thereby obstructing transcription and leading to apoptosis predominantly in hepatocytes. Silibinin acts to block the absorption of amatoxins by hepatocytes and disrupts the enterohepatic recirculation of these toxins

### Mushroom poisoning from species of genus inocybe (fiber head mushroom): a case series with exact species identification [^111P8NhA]. Clinical Toxicology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Many species of the genus Inocybe (family Cortinariaceae, higher Basidiomycetes) are muscarine-containing mycorrhizal mushrooms, ubiquitous around the world. The few published reports on the poisonous Inocybe mushrooms are often limited by the inadequate identification of the species. The clinical course of patients with typical muscarinic manifestations, in whom Inocybe spp. was unequivocally identified, is reported.

Case Series

Between November 2006 and January 2008 14 consecutive patients with typical muscarinic syndrome after mushroom ingestion were recorded. The clinical manifestations included combinations of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, hypersalivation, diaphoresis, tachycardia, bradycardia, hypotension, lacrimation, blurred vision, miosis, tremor, restlessness, flushing, and syncope. Time to onset of toxicity ranged between 15 min and 2 h after consumption, 5 h in one patient. Treatment was supportive, including intravenous fluids, antiemetics, and 1 mg atropine intravenously. Full recovery ensued within 12 h. In all the cases, an expert mycologist unequivocally identified the leftovers of the consumed mushrooms as Inocybe fastigiata, Inocybe geophylla, and Inocybe patouillardii.

Conclusion

In this case series of patients who ingested identified muscarine-containing mushrooms supportive treatment and atropine resulted in recovery in all cases.

### Investigation and analysis of galerina sulciceps poisoning in a canteen [^114ceCEU]. Clinical Toxicology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Guizhou Province in China has an abundant resource of wild mushrooms, including numerous poisonous species which contain various toxins. The mortality rate from wild mushroom poisoning has been high in this area in recent years. Galerina sulciceps is a dangerously toxic mushroom which can be fatal if ingested.

Methods

we report on an epidemiological investigation of G. sulciceps poisoning which occurred in Duyun City of Guizhou Province. The characteristics of this species, its toxicity, observed clinical features, laboratory data, treatment modality, and prognosis were investigated in order to provide a reference point for the prevention and treatment of this kind of mushroom poisoning.

Results

Thirteen employees showed toxic symptoms after ingesting wild mushrooms the previous day in a company canteen. Clinical manifestation varied from gastroenteritis to hepatic and renal dysfunction. Most of the 13 patients presented with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and elevated levels of biochemical indices of hepatic and renal function, during which transaminase concentration peaked within 48–72h. At 48hours post-ingestion, all patients had hemodialysis, in addition to supportive care for hepatic and renal injury with oral Silibinin and Shenshuaining. All acute renal injury had resolved by day 10, and liver transaminases had trended toward normal in all patients and they were discharged. At follow-up in 30 days, both liver and renal function had completely recovered in all.

Conclusion

This poisoning occurs as a result of unintentional consumption of G. sulciceps, which is relatively rare in mushroom poisonings. All patients recovered fully after timely diagnosis and treatment. To prevent wild mushroom poisoning, the best preventive measure is to educate the public not to gather and eat any unidentified wild mushrooms.

### Amanita phalloides mushroom poisonings-Northern California, December 2016 [^116cKe4P]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Amanita phalloides, colloquially known as the "death cap", belongs to the Phalloideae section of the Amanita family of mushrooms and is responsible for most deaths following ingestion of foraged mushrooms worldwide. On November 28, 2016, members of the Bay Area Mycological Society notified personnel at the California Poison Control System (CPCS) of an unusually large A. phalloides bloom in the greater San Francisco Bay Area, coincident with the abundant rainfall and recent warm weather. Five days later, CPCS received notification of the first human A. phalloides poisoning of the season. Over the following 2 weeks, CPCS was notified of an additional 13 cases of hepatotoxicity resulting from A. phalloides ingestion. In the past few years before this outbreak, CPCS received reports of only a few mushroom poisoning cases per year. A summary of 14 reported cases is presented here. Data extracted from patient medical charts revealed a pattern of delayed gastrointestinal manifestations of intoxication leading to dehydration and hepatotoxicity. Three patients received liver transplants and all but one recovered completely. The morbidity and potential lethality associated with A. phalloides ingestion are serious public health concerns and warrant medical provider education and dissemination of information cautioning against consuming foraged wild mushrooms.

### Russula subnigricans poisoning: from gastrointestinal symptoms to rhabdomyolysis [^1179RjJE]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Wild mushroom poisoning is often reported to cause acute liver or renal failure. However, acute rhabdomyolysis caused by wild mushroom poisoning has rarely been reported. We describe 7 patients of 1 family with Russula subnigricans Hongo poisoning. Their clinical manifestations varied from gastrointestinal symptoms to rhabdomyolysis, with 1 fatality. Our report provides supporting evidence that rhabdomyolysis may result from ingestion of R subnigricans mushrooms. A key to survival for patients with rhabdomyolysis caused by R subnigricans poisoning may be early recognition and intensive supportive care.

### Amanita phalloides mushroom poisonings-Northern California, December 2016 [^112dTLv4]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Initial case. A man aged 37 years (patient A) picked two wild mushrooms in Santa Rosa, California (Table). He cooked and ate one mushroom, and approximately 10 hours later developed nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. He was evaluated in a local emergency department (ED) for abdominal discomfort 20.5 hours after ingestion. A mycologist identified the uncooked mushroom sample provided by the patient as A. phalloides. Initial laboratory findings were notable for an elevated white blood cell count with lactate elevation and elevated creatinine suggesting dehydration (Table). Liver function tests (LFTs) 6 hours later showed elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (92 IU/L; normal = 15–41) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (95 IU/L; normal = 17–63) levels. He was treated with aggressive intravenous (IV) fluid hydration, IV octreotide, * and IV silibinin. † Two days after ingestion, the patient's LFTs peaked at AST = 6,159 IU/L, ALT = 3,084 IU/L, total bilirubin = 2.9 mg/dL (normal = 0.2–1.2), and international normalized ratio (INR) (standardized prothrombin time) 3.2 units (normal = 0.8–1.2). Gastrointestinal symptoms and laboratory values gradually improved, and the patient was discharged home on day 6.

### Increasing incidence of mycotoxicosis in south-Eastern Germany: a comprehensive analysis of mushroom poisonings at a university medical center [^117Gzvh7]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Study limitations

This research represents a retrospective analysis from a single center, which may limit the generalizability of its findings. Additionally, the precise identification of mushroom species often poses significant challenges. Moreover, establishing a direct causal link to climate change remains difficult due to the complexity of contributing factors. Given the relatively small number of cases and the considerable diversity of mushroom species involved, the current findings require further validation through additional studies to ensure robustness and generalizability.

### A case study: rare lepiota brunneoincarnata poisoning [^114aB3vF]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Amatoxin poisoning from the genus Lepiota may have a deadly outcome, although this is not seen as often as it is from the genus Amanita. In this report, we present a patient who was poisoned by a sublethal dose of Lepiota brunneoincarnata mushrooms. The patient was hospitalized 12 hours after eating the mushrooms. The patient's transaminase levels increased dramatically starting on day 4. Aspartate transaminase peaked at 78 hours. Starting at 1265 IU/L, alanine transaminase peaked at 90 hours at 5124 IU/L. The patient was discharged on day 8 to outpatient care, and his transaminase levels returned to normal ranges in the subsequent days. A toxin analysis was carried out on the mushrooms that the patient claimed to have eaten. Using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography analysis, an uptake of approximately 19.9 mg of amatoxin from nearly 30 g of mushrooms was calculated. This consisted of 10.59 mg of α-amanitin, 9.18 mg of β-amanitin, and 0.16 mg of γ-amanitin. In conclusion, we present a patient from Turkey who was poisoned by L. brunneoincarnata mushrooms.

### Increasing incidence of mycotoxicosis in south-Eastern Germany: a comprehensive analysis of mushroom poisonings at a university medical center [^111ebj5U]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first systematic analyses of patients treated for mushroom poisoning at a Bavarian hospital. Diagnosing mycotoxicosis poses significant challenges due to the frequent absence of mushroom remnants and the lack of rapid, reliable detection methods. In instances of suspected death cap (Amanita phalloides) ingestion, timely therapeutic intervention is critical to avert fatal outcomes. Laboratory detection is feasible in specialized facilities; however, its clinical utility is limited by substantial time delays and potential for false negatives due to symptom latency. Clinical judgment, grounded in a thorough patient history and specific inquiries about wild mushroom consumption, becomes paramount, particularly for emergency department physicians who must be adept at recognizing key indicators during mushroom season.

Climate change and seasonal trends

The study explored whether climate change has influenced the timing of mushroom poisonings since 2005. Our findings indicate no significant shift in the seasonal occurrence of these incidents, which predominantly take place between August and November. As temperatures rise, there is a corresponding increase in hydro-climatic extremes. Elevated rainfall intensity and more frequent flood maxima, coupled with warmer conditions, are conducive to fungal proliferation in autumn. The average rainfall in recent years has frequently exceeded the annual averages from many years ago. Consequently, regions previously too cold or dry are now witnessing the emergence of various new fungal species. This shift in fungal occurrence enhances the likelihood of species misidentification, thereby increasing the risk of accidental intoxications. In 2015, a correlation between rising average temperatures and mushroom poisonings was identified in Hunan Province. Another group observed a correlation between meteorological factors and mushroom poisonings as well.

Rising incidence of mushroom poisonings

An increasing number in mushroom poisonings over the past nine years was observed. This rise is probably attributed to a greater public inclination towards nature-based leisure activities, including mushroom foraging. The proliferation of digital resources and identification apps may have paradoxically fostered a false sense of security, reducing the hesitation to gather and consume wild mushrooms. This underscores the need for continued public education to highlight the risks of potentially fatal misidentifications.

### Amanita smithiana mushroom ingestion: a case of delayed renal failure and literature review [^116bSQR5]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

In the Pacific Northwest a new pattern of mushroom ingestion has emerged, attributed to Amanita smithiana, in which renal failure has been the predominant manifestation.

Case Report

A 55-year-old male ate 3 raw wild mushrooms in a salad and had onset of severe nausea and vomiting within 6 hours. His vital signs were unremarkable. His labs were significant for a BUN of 14 mg/dL (5.0 mmol/L), and a creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL (88 umol/L), transaminases were elevated with an AST of 56 U/L (nl 9–40) and an ALT of 131 U/L (nl 14–72). Treatment was initiated with N-acetyl cysteine, penicillin, and milk thistle extract on the presumption that this was an amanitin-toxin containing mushroom. He developed acute renal failure that was not responsive to our treatment. Dialysis started on day 4 with a creatinine of 6.5 mg/dL, which peaked on day 7 at 10.2 mg/dL. We were able to obtain a positive mushroom identification by a mycologist as Amanita smithiana. The patient was discharged from the hospital for outpatient dialysis on day 10 and dialysis catheter was removed 39 days after ingestion with a creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL (123.8 umol/L).

Discussion

Amanita smithiana mushroom poisoning presents within 6 hours of ingestion with GI toxicity, and develops delayed onset of renal insufficiency over the first 1 to 4 days. The early hospitalization of this case allowed a profile of the onset of liver and renal injury. Mild elevation of hepatic transaminases occurred on presentation and peaked 24 hours after the ingestion. Renal injury was detected 1 day after presentation, and progressed to require hemodialysis by 4 days postingestion. This pattern of delayed-onset renal toxic mushroom ingestion is emerging among mushroom ingestions in Western North America.

### Acute liver failure [^116LqzRM]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Acute liver failure (ALF) is defined as hepatic encephalopathy complicating acute liver injury. The most common etiologies are acute viral hepatitis A and B, medication overdose (e.g., acetaminophen), idiosyncratic drug reactions, ingestion of other toxins (e.g., amanita mushroom poisoning), and metabolic disorders (e.g. Reye's syndrome). Despite advances in intensive care management, mortality continues to be high (40–80%) and is partly related to ALF's complications, such as cerebral edema, sepsis, hypoglycemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, and acute renal failure. Several prognostic models have been developed to determine which patients will spontaneously recover. Treatment is directed at early recognition of the complications and general supportive measures. The only proven therapy for those who are unlikely to recover is liver transplantation. Therefore, recognition of ALF is paramount, and urgent referral to a transplant center is critical to assess transplantation status.

### Acute liver failure guidelines [^1162RxWx]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Mushroom (amatoxin) poisoning — care patterns and therapies in acute liver failure: Utilization data show that "only 23% of patients presenting with amanita-induced ALF received silibinin, 39% received penicillin, and 85% received NAC". Intravenous penicillin G "is also believed to block the hepatic uptake of α-amanitin" with dosing as "a continuous infusion of 1,000,000 IU/kg on day 1 and 1,500,000 IU/kg on days 2 and 3", and "penicillin G is considered the second-line therapy". N-acetylcysteine dosing is specified as "150 mg/kg over 15 minutes, followed by 50 mg/kg over 4 hours, followed by 100 mg/kg over 16 hours". Extracorporeal support notes state there is "low serum level of amatoxin… therefore, hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, and plasmapheresis are of little benefit", and that the "Molecular Adsorbent RecirculatingSystem may be beneficial, but more data are needed before this can be routinely recommended". Definitive therapy is described: "Ultimately, LT is an effective intervention for ALF due to amanita phalloides poisoning with excellent outcomes".

### Features of patients with severe hepatitis Due to mushroom poisoning and factors associated with outcome [^111LMirg]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Acute liver failure after ingestion of toxic mushrooms is a significant medical problem. Most exposures to toxic mushrooms produce no symptoms or only mild gastroenteritis, but some lead to severe hepatic necrosis and fulminant hepatic failure requiring liver transplantation. We aimed to assess mortality from mushroom poisoning and identify variables associated with survival and liver transplantation.

Methods

We collected information from 27 patients (13 male; median age, 47 years) admitted to the emergency department within 24 hours of ingesting wild mushrooms. They developed severe liver injury (serum levels of transaminases greater than 400 IU/L) and were treated with activated charcoal and N-acetylcysteine at a tertiary medical center in San Francisco, California from January 1997 through December 2014. Viral hepatitis, autoimmune liver disease, acetaminophen, salicylate toxicity, and chronic liver diseases were ruled out for all patients. We analyzed patient demographics, time since ingestion, presenting symptoms, laboratory values, and therapies administered. A good outcome was defined as survival without need for liver transplant. A poor outcome was defined as death or liver transplant. Positive predictive values were calculated, and the χ 2 test was used to analyze dichotomous variables.

Results

Liver injury was attributed to ingestion of Amanita phalloides in 24 patients and Amanita ocreata in 3 patients. Twenty-four of the patients ingested mushrooms with meals and 3 patients for hallucinogenic purpose. At 24–48 hours after ingestion, all patients had serum levels of alanine aminotransferase ranging from 554 to 4546 IU/L (median, 2185 IU/L). Acute renal impairment developed in 5 patients. Twenty-three patients survived without liver transplantation, and 4 patients had poor outcomes (1 woman underwent liver transplantation on day 20 after mushroom ingestion, and 3 women died of hepatic failure). Of the 23 patients with peak levels of total bilirubin of 2 mg/dL or more during hospitalization, only 4 had a poor outcome. Peak serum level of aspartate aminotransferase less than 4000 IU/L, peak international normalized ratio less than 2, and a value of serum factor V greater than 30% identified patients with good outcomes with 100% positive predictive value; if these peak values were used as a cutoff, 10 of 27 patients (37%), 7 of 27 patients (26%), and 6 of 12 patients (50%), respectively, could have avoided transfer to a transplant center.

Conclusions

In an analysis of 27 patients with hepatocellular damage due to mushroom (Amanita) poisoning and peak levels of total bilirubin greater than 2 mg/dL, the probability of liver transplantation or death is 17%, fulfilling Hy's law. Patients with peak levels of aspartate aminotransferase less than 4000 IU/L can be monitored in a local hospital, whereas patients with higher levels should be transferred to liver transplant centers. Women and older patients were more likely to have a poor outcome than men and younger patients.

Rhabdomyolysis resulting from mushroom poisoning previously has been unreported in the literature. We present an outbreak of Russula subnigricans poisoning with rhabdomyolysis. The most severely ill patient presented with rhabdomyolysis, severe electrolyte disturbance (hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia), respiratory failure, acute renal failure, pulmonary edema, ventricular tachycardia, and circulatory shock. Mycotoxin may be the cause of rhabdomyolysis. In areas where mushroom gathering is common, mushroom poisoning should be included in the differential diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis.

### Identification of indocyanine green as a STT3B inhibitor against mushroom α-amanitin cytotoxicity [^111cVDdC]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

In this study, we focused on 4 h interval between AMA injection and ICG treatment since this 4 h interval was the same as that used in previous studies to mimic actual human poisoning and treatment scenarios. Therefore, this will facilitate us to compare our results with others on how ICG is effective in treating AMA toxicity. ICG has shown great potential for treating AMA poisoning in mice and ICG treatment can significantly attenuate AMA-induced damage in the liver and kidney, the two major AMA-targeting organs, resulting in improved survival. Furthermore, we observed that ICG lose its treatment effect on AMA toxicity when it was delivered 8 and 12 h post AMA injection. This may be because AMA has caused irreversible damage during early hours of cytotoxicity, which is unable to be salvaged by ICG treatment. This suggests that ICG should be given as early as possible during treatment.

Overall, we show that by coupling whole-genome functional genomic characterization with in silico drug prediction, we can rapidly define and then target medically relevant processes.

Treatment modalities and outcomes

Outpatient cases typically involved the consumption of psilocybin mushrooms (Psilocybe species), champignons (Agaricus species), and bitter boletes (Tylopilus felleus). One patient who consumed spoiled champignons required endoscopic intervention and proton pump inhibitors due to Mallory-Weiss lesions.

Suspected death cap (Amanita phalloides) ingestions were promptly treated with intravenous Silibinin (20 mg/kg per day, divided into 4 doses over two hours each, until transaminase normalization or a maximum of five days). In 41,9% (18/43) cases, Silibinin was the sole therapy. Additional treatments included combinations of Silibinin with N-Acetylcysteine, activated charcoal, and Rifaximin. In situations where Silibinin was initially unavailable, Penicillin G was administered until patient transfer to our department, with N-Acetylcysteine added in two cases. Three patients exhibited highly elevated transaminase levels and significantly reduced metabolic and synthetic liver function. Among these, one patient (2.3%) died from liver failure, another received a liver transplantation, and one patient recovered spontaneously (Table 1). Psychotropic mushroom (Psilocybe semilanceata) and Psilocybin intoxications were managed with Lorazepam as needed, and activated charcoal was used in two instances. Eight patients (8,6%) with mild symptoms required no therapy.

Clinical presentations and laboratory findings

86% (37/43) of patients presented with gastrointestinal symptoms, and one experienced cramps, dizziness, and headache. Three severe cases (7%) involved reduced Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores, averaging 7.3, necessitating intubation. Elevated SOFA scores were observed in 25,6% (11/43) patients, ranging from 1–16, with an average of 4 (± 4.7).

### Analysis of mushroom exposures in Texas requiring hospitalization, 2005–2006 [^111kb2N6]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Texas has approximately 200 species of wild mushrooms, including toxic and hallucinogenic varieties. Mushroom ingestions in Texas were studied for 2005–2006.

Methods

Data was obtained via Texas Poison Control Centers and retrospectively reviewed. Case notes were reviewed individually regarding initial reporting, age, signs and symptoms, toxic effect, management, and patient outcomes.

Results

A total of 742 exposures occurred during the study period. All exposures were acute and intentional. Of these exposures, 59 (7.9%) were admitted to the hospital, with 17 (28.8% of admissions) requiring admission to a critical care unit. Four cases required inpatient psychiatric admission. The average age of admitted exposures was 20.5 years, with a male-to-female predominance of 3.3:1. Eleven (22.9%) of the admitted exposures were identified, with Psilocybin being the most common agent (n = 10, 91%). Among the admissions, co-ingestions were identified with the mushroom ingestion in eleven patients (40.7%). The most common symptoms in admitted patients were vomiting (n = 34, 57.6%), nausea (n = 19, 32.2%), altered mental status (n = 17, 28.8%), abdominal pain (n = 13, 22%), and diarrhea (n = 10, 16.9%).

Conclusions

All mushroom exposures examined were acute and intentional. Major toxic reactions were uncommon, and no deaths were reported. Serious poisoning from mushroom ingestion is rare in Texas; however, there is greater need for information dissemination on morbidity.

Mushroom poisonings can have devastating consequences. As climate change potentially extends the traditional peak mushroom seasons, physicians must be particularly vigilant. Due to climate change and an increase in nature-based leisure activities, the number of mushroom poisonings is rising. Accurate identification of the consumed mushroom is essential for initiating the correct specific therapy. Prompt initiation of treatments like Silibinin and N-Acetylcysteine is crucial in suspected death cap (Amanita phalloides) poisonings. Patients with significant liver enzyme elevation should be referred to liver transplantation centers. Our study suggests that plasmapheresis can serve as an effective bridge to recovery, potentially eliminating the need for liver transplantation in patients with acute liver failure and associated coagulopathy.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^113rEXxf]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Idiosyncratic DILI — drug-specific interventions: For valproate-associated hyperammonemia in hospitalized children, L-carnitine can be given as 100 mg/kg load followed by 50 mg/kg every 8 h for short-term use. For leflunomide cases with persistent cholestasis, cholestyramine is dosed at 1 packet every 6–8 h for 14 days with taper once cholestasis/pruritus resolves, given separately from other medications. For Amanita mushroom toxicity, penicillin (i.v.)/silymarin and dialysis are used in hospitalized patients or ALF as short-term use to remove enterohepatic toxin. For severe sinusoidal obstruction syndrome after hematopoietic cell transplant, defibrotide (i.v.) is dosed at 6.25 mg/kg every 6 h for > 21 days up to a maximum of 60 days and has been shown to improve survival in children and adults compared with historical controls.

### Toxicity of muscimol and ibotenic acid containing mushrooms reported to a regional poison control center from 2002–2016 [^115SFcPz]. Clinical Toxicology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Amanita muscaria (AM) and A. pantherina (AP) contain ibotenic acid and muscimol and may cause both excitatory and sedating symptoms. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are not classically described but have been reported. There are relatively few reported cases of poisoning with these mushrooms in North America.

Methods

This is a retrospective review of ingestions of ibotenic acid and muscimol containing mushrooms reported to a United States regional poison center from 2002–2016. Cases were included if identification was made by a mycologist or if AM was clearly described.

Results

Thirty-four cases met inclusion criteria. There were 23 cases of AM, 10 AP, and 1 A. aprica. Reason for ingestion included foraging (12), recreational (6), accidental (12), therapeutic (1), self-harm (1), and unknown (2). Of the accidental pediatric ingestions 4 (25%) were symptomatic. None of the children with a symptomatic ingestion of AM required admission. A 3-year-old male who ingested AP had vomiting, agitation, and lethargy and received benzodiazepines. He was intubated and had a 3-day ICU stay. There were 25 symptomatic patients. All but one patient developed symptoms within 6h. Six patients had symptoms for less than 6h while 15 had symptoms lasting less than 24h. Ingestions of AP were more symptomatic than AM with regard to the presence of any GI symptoms (80% vs. 35%), central nervous system (CNS) depression (70% vs. 35%), and CNS excitation (70% vs. 35%) respectively. Five patients were intubated. No patients experienced hypotension, seizures, acute kidney injury, or hepatotoxicity. No deaths were reported.

Discussion

Ingestion of ibotenic acid/muscimol containing mushrooms often produces a syndrome with GI upset, CNS excitation, and CNS depression either alone or in combination. Ingestion of AP was associated with a higher rate of symptoms compared to AM.

### Treatment of intoxication with cortinarius speciosissimus using an antioxidant therapy [^113sHZ9N]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

The authors present the case reports of a 30-year-old man and his 29-year-old wife who ingested a mushroom meal containing Cortinarius speciosissimus. Features of this intoxication include gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea as well as back pain. The toxin orellanine is nephrotoxic and can lead to acute renal failure. A long symptom-free interval of 2 to 21 days is characteristic of this poisoning. The diagnosis can be made by mycologic testing or by toxicologic analysis of a renal biopsy specimen. Reported therapeutic options include hemodialysis, plasmapheresis, or drug therapy with corticosteroids, all of which have yielded variable results. Here the authors report the use of antioxidant therapy in 2 patients with acute renal failure caused by Cortinarius speciosissimus intoxication.

### Identification of indocyanine green as a STT3B inhibitor against mushroom α-amanitin cytotoxicity [^115AMCCE]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The "death cap", Amanita phalloides, is the world's most poisonous mushroom, responsible for 90% of mushroom-related fatalities. The most fatal component of the death cap is α-amanitin. Despite its lethal effect, the exact mechanisms of how α-amanitin poisons humans remain unclear, leading to no specific antidote available for treatment. Here we show that STT3B is required for α-amanitin toxicity and its inhibitor, indocyanine green (ICG), can be used as a specific antidote. By combining a genome-wide CRISPR screen with an in silico drug screening and in vivo functional validation, we discover that N-glycan biosynthesis pathway and its key component, STT3B, play a crucial role in α-amanitin toxicity and that ICG is a STT3B inhibitor. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ICG is effective in blocking the toxic effect of α-amanitin in cells, liver organoids, and male mice, resulting in an overall increase in animal survival. Together, by combining a genome-wide CRISPR screen for α-amanitin toxicity with an in silico drug screen and functional validation in vivo, our study highlights ICG as a STT3B inhibitor against the mushroom toxin.

### ACMT position statement: medical toxicology considerations in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with concerns about mold-related inhalation exposures [^113fMDgh]. ACMT (2025). High credibility.

ACMT position statement — mycotoxins in indoor air and exposure magnitude states that mycotoxins in indoor air are large, complex molecules that are not volatile and their concentrations in indoor and outdoor air are exceedingly low, and exposure modeling indicates that even in moldy environments the maximum inhalation dose is generally orders of magnitude lower than demonstrated thresholds for adverse health effects. Human studies in agricultural environments are described as demonstrating that in moldy environments inhalation exposure results in a dose far less than what is normally encountered from dietary exposure. ACMT recommends that future studies utilize validated biomarker methods as indicators of internal dose to assess cumulative exposure and the dose-response relationship, bearing in mind the variably short elimination half-life of most mycotoxins, and states that it is inappropriate to attribute identification of mycotoxins in urine to postulated remote inhalation exposure.

### Increasing incidence of mycotoxicosis in south-Eastern Germany: a comprehensive analysis of mushroom poisonings at a university medical center [^113rkygw]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Mushrooms, an integral component of human diets, range from esteemed delicacies to potentially lethal toxins. The risk of severe poisoning from misidentified species, poses a significant challenge. For clinicians, recognizing mushroom poisoning amidst nonspecific symptoms and determining the specific mushroom ingested are critical yet complex tasks. Additionally, climate change affects the distribution and proliferation of mushroom species, potentially heightening the risk of exposure to toxic varieties. The identification of mushroom intoxication is critical for appropriate treatment. Poisoning with highly toxic species, such as Amanita phalloides (death cap), can result in acute liver and kidney failure. Considering the limited therapeutic options currently available for acute liver failure, we investigated the application of plasmapheresis, a procedure involving the replacement of the patient's plasma with donor plasma, as a potential intervention to improve clinical outcomes in severe cases of mushroom poisoning.

Methods

This study aimed to assess the trends and treatment outcomes of mushroom poisoning cases from 2005 to 2022, with a particular focus on the number of incidents and the potential impacts of climate change. We undertook a retrospective monocentric cohort study, evaluating 43 patients with mushroom poisoning. The study focused on identifying the variety of mushrooms involved, including psychotropic, spoiled, inedible, or toxic species, and closely examined patients with elevated transaminases indicative for liver damage. To assess clinical outcomes, we evaluated several aspects, including hepatic encephalopathy and other symptoms. Additionally, we monitored blood analysis results through serial measurements, including transaminases, bilirubin, INR, and creatinine levels. Furthermore, we explored the impact of climate changes on the incidence of mushroom poisoning.

Results

While the incidence of mushroom poisonings remained relatively stable during the first eight years of the study period, it nearly doubled over the past nine years. Nine distinct mushroom types were documented. The study showed no change in season patterns of mushroom poisonings. In cases of severe liver damage accompanied by coagulopathy, plasmapheresis was utilized to replace deficient clotting factors and mitigate the inflammatory response. This intervention proved effective in stabilizing coagulation parameters, such as the international normalized ratio (INR) Plasmapheresis was performed until the INR reached stable levels, preventing the occurrence of severe bleeding complications. In instances where liver failure was deemed irreversible, plasmapheresis functioned as a bridging therapy to manage bleeding risks and to stabilize the patient while awaiting liver transplantation.

Conclusion

The findings underscore the need for heightened awareness among healthcare professionals regarding mushroom poisoning and emphasize the importance of considering climate change as a factor that may alter mushroom distribution and toxicity. Additionally, this study highlights the potential of plasmapheresis in managing severe cases.

### Use of amifostine, a novel cytoprotective, in α-amanitin poisoning [^113zH3QF]. Clinical Toxicology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Mortality from ingestions of the mushroom Amanita phalloides remains as high as 20–40% with many surviving patients requiring liver transplantation. A variety of treatments for Amanita ingestion have been evaluated, yet other than supportive measures, no effective therapy has been identified. In addition, an antidote for Amanita toxicity may not be practical due to delayed patient presentation. The drug amifostine was proposed to potentially improve survival from alpha-amanitin toxicity by conferring cytoprotective effects on hepatocytes at risk for cell death. Amifostine is used as a radio — and chemo-protective agent. It protects against lipoperoxidation, interferes with the cross-linking of DNA, and may act by other mechanisms yet to be identified, making it attractive for potentially attenuating ongoing hepatic necrosis. It has not previously been studied in a toxicologic model.

Study Objective

To determine whether amifostine is an effective postexposure therapy for alpha-amanitin, the primary lethal toxin in Amanita phalloides.

Methods

Swiss mice (n = 30 in all groups) were given an approximate LD75 dose of intraperitoneal (i.p.) alpha-amanitin. Amifostine was administered i.p. 6 h after poisoning in three cumulative dosing groups: 250 mg/kg; 500 mg/kg; and 1600 mg/kg. Controls received equal volumes of i.p. sterile 0.9% saline. Mice were monitored and time of death recorded. At day 7, survival was assumed and the remaining mice were euthanized. Qualitative histologic comparisons of hepatic and renal toxicity were performed.

Results

At day 7, only 10% of the control mice survived. Survival in the amifostine 250, 500, and 1600 mg/kg groups was 20%, 20%, and 3%, respectively. No statistically significant differences were detected in Kaplan-Meier survival between the control group and those receiving 250 or 500 mg/kg; however, there was a statistically significant decrease in survival for the group receiving 1600 mg/kg (p = 0.0002).

Conclusion

No survival benefit was seen with cumulative doses between 250 and 500 mg/kg; however, higher doses may result in subsequent toxicity and decreased survival.

### Progressive organ failure after ingestion of wild garlic juice [^112TVrTr]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Wild garlic and related plants are increasingly sought after by fans of natural products. They can be confused with other plants containing colchicine and cause potentially fatal intoxications.

Case Report

We report a case of accidental poisoning by Colchicum autumnale, which was mistaken for wild garlic (Allium ursinum). The patient initially presented with mild gastrointestinal symptoms, but progressed rapidly to agranulocytosis, paraparesis, and delirium before the causative agent was identified. The laboratory tests revealed rhabdomyolysis, coagulopathy, alteration of liver tests, and prerenal azotemia. Botanical examination confirmed the incriminated plant (Colchicum autumnale). Serum and urine analysis confirmed the presence of colchicine. The patient required intensive support therapy, and she fully recovered within 8 weeks. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Colchicine poisoning should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with gastroenteritis after ingestion of wild garlic.

### Adverse experiences resulting in emergency medical treatment seeking following the use of magic mushrooms [^115UUrM1]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

There are only three known deaths attributed to magic mushroom toxicity. The estimated lethal dose of psilocybin is approximately 6 g of psilocybin drug substance, in essence 1000 times more than the threshold dose of 6 mg and equivalent to about 10 kg of fresh mushrooms. Lethal overdose from eating mushrooms is, therefore, impractical as emesis would likely occur before absorption of toxic levels of the drug. However, variations in magic mushrooms' potency between species, growing conditions and preservation can make estimating dosage difficult, hence increasing the risk of non-critical overdoses and challenging experiences.

The powerful psychological effects of psilocybin can, even in moderate doses, induce adverse reactions characterized by, for instance, anxiety, disorientation, fear, grief, paranoia and panic attacks. Symptoms usually resolve within 6 h once the substance's effects wear off, but a proportion report experiencing long-term detrimental effects on mental health and, in rarer cases, 'flashbacks', recurrences of perceptual alterations or other sensations experienced during the trip. Furthermore, psilocybin-induced panic reactions and impairments in judgement and perception can contribute to dangerous behaviour, accidents, self-harming and even suicidality. For instance, a small number of deaths from falls or jumps from tall buildings have been attributed to magic mushroom use.

### Amatoxin poisoning: a 15-year retrospective analysis and follow-up evaluation of 105 patients [^112vUvaq]. Clinical Toxicology (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Fatalities due to mushroom poisonings are increasing worldwide, with more than 90% of deaths resulting from ingestion of amatoxin-containing species.

Methods

A retrospective evaluation of the history and clinical outcome of each patient treated from 1988 to 2002 in the Toxicological Unit of Careggi General Hospital (University of Florence, Italy) for amatoxin poisoning. Data included the biological parameters monitored, the treatment protocols used (intensive fluid and supportive therapy, restitution of the altered coagulation factors, multiple-dose activated charcoal, mannitol, dexamethasone, glutathione, and penicillin G), and outpatient follow-up evaluations.

Results

The clinical data of 111 patients were evaluated; their biological parameters were monitored every 12–24 hours until discharge. Two patients died; both were admitted to the hospital more than 60 hours after mushroom ingestion. Of all the laboratory parameters evaluated, the evolution of hepatic transaminases and prothrombin activity over four days were the most predictive indicators of recovery or death. Our follow-up evaluation of 105 patients demonstrated that our survivors recovered completely.

Conclusions

Our experience indicates that the protocol used in our Toxicologicy Unit is effective for amatoxin poisoning, and that all patients treated within 36 hours after mushroom ingestion were cured without sequelae.

### Identification of indocyanine green as a STT3B inhibitor against mushroom α-amanitin cytotoxicity [^1172GvAe]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Recently, pooled clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screens have accelerated our molecular understanding of molecular mechanisms controlling cell death. These high-throughput CRISPR screens have been widely utilized to identify genes or pathways involved in drug resistance –, mechanisms of bacteria toxin –, or viral infection –. Furthermore, we have used this approach to dissect the molecular mechanisms of deadly jellyfish venom leading to a potent antidote for jellyfish toxicity.

In this study, we want to establish a systematic framework to develop antidotes by combining the identification of novel drug targets using a genome-wide CRISPR screen and a virtual screen of FDA-approved drugs. We first performed a genome-wide CRISPR loss-of-function screen to identify genes and pathways involved in AMA cytotoxicity. We found that several novel pathways including N-Glycan biosynthesis and cholesterol metabolism were involved in AMA-induced cell death. We further showed that N-Glycan biosynthesis and its catalytic enzyme STT3B were required for AMA toxicity. By combining these data with in silico screening of FDA-approved drugs and follow-up functional validation, we successfully identified ICG as a potential STT3B inhibitor. We further demonstrated that ICG could block AMA-induced cell death in vivo and in vitro, suggesting ICG may have utility in treating AMA/death cap poisoning.

### Amanitin intoxication: effects of therapies on clinical outcomes-a review of 40 years of reported cases [^117LK1ir]. Clinical Toxicology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Amanita phalloides poisoning causes severe liver damage which may be potentially fatal. Several treatments are available, but their effectiveness has not been systematically evaluated. We performed a systematic review to investigate the effect of the most commonly used therapies: N-acetylcysteine (NAC), benzylpenicillin (PEN), and silibinin (SIL) on patient outcomes. In addition, other factors contributing to patient outcomes are identified.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE and Embase for case series and case reports that described patient outcomes after poisoning with amanitin-containing Amanita mushrooms. We extracted clinical characteristics, treatment details, and outcomes. We used the liver item from the Poisoning Severity Score (PSS) to categorize intoxication severity.

Results

We included 131 publications describing a total of 877 unique cases. The overall survival rate of all patients was 84%. Patients receiving only supportive care had a survival rate of 59%. The use of SIL or PEN was associated with a 90% (OR 6.40 [3.14–13.04]) and 89% (OR 5.24 [2.87–9.56]) survival rate, respectively. NAC/SIL combination therapy was associated with 85% survival rate (OR 3.85 [2.04, 7.25]). NAC/PEN/SIL treatment group had a survival rate of 76% (OR 2.11 [1.25, 3.57]). Due to the limited number of cases, the use of NAC alone could not be evaluated. Additional analyses in 'proven cases' (amanitin detected), 'probable cases' (mushroom identified by mycologist), and 'possible cases' (neither amanitin detected nor mushroom identified) showed comparable results, but the results did not reach statistical significance. Transplantation-free survivors had significantly lower peak values of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total serum bilirubin (TSB), and international normalized ratio (INR) compared to liver transplantation survivors and patients with fatal outcomes. Higher peak PSS was associated with increased mortality.

Conclusion

Based on data available, no statistical differences could be observed for the effects of NAC, PEN or SIL in proven poisonings with amanitin-containing mushrooms. However, monotherapy with SIL or PEN and combination therapy with NAC/SIL appear to be associated with higher survival rates compared to supportive care alone. AST, ALT, TSB, and INR values are possible predictors of potentially fatal outcomes.

### Notes from the field: acute intoxications from consumption of amanita muscaria mushrooms-Minnesota, 2018 [^114NrbfL]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

In October, 2018, a middle-aged ethnic Karen * man from Burma was evaluated at a hospital emergency department with altered mental status, vomiting, diarrhea, incontinence, sweating, swelling of the lip and tongue, and excessive salivation. Signs and symptoms began approximately 2–3 hours after eating mushrooms at home. The patient was admitted for supportive treatment, including endotracheal intubation for airway protection and mechanical ventilation because of acute respiratory failure and hypoxia for 4 days. His daughter, who also ate the mushrooms, was evaluated for similar, but milder symptoms, including mild sweating and nausea; she was admitted overnight for observation, and was discharged the following day. The father recovered and was discharged 8 days after admission.

An emergency department physician suspected possible cholinergic mushroom toxicosis and notified the Minnesota Poison Control System (MPCS). MPCS notified the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH), and, together with the Minnesota Mycological Society (MMS), they initiated an investigation. The patient's medical records and exposure history were obtained and reviewed, and he was interviewed through a Karen language interpreter. He described the mushroom and collection location and later sent a photo of a mushroom that he said looked similar to the one he picked. He reported that he had picked mushrooms from an area near his workplace and cooked them in turmeric, oil, and water; only he and his daughter had eaten the mushrooms, and she reportedly consumed substantially fewer mushrooms than he did. He said this was the first time he had picked mushrooms since arriving in Minnesota in 2015 and that he had selected the mushrooms because they resembled the Ochre mushroom (Amanita hemibapha var. ochracea) from his native Burma. A site visit to the location where the mushrooms were picked identified one remaining mushroom that matched the patient's description (Figure); an MMS mycologist examined the mushroom and identified it as Amanita muscaria var. guessowii.

### Clinical guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of botulism, 2021 [^1134J9jX]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on botulism:

- **Definition**: Botulism is a rare, life-threatening disease caused by the neurotoxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum.
- **Pathophysiology**: Botulism is caused by the anaerobic, Gram-positive bacterium Clostridium botulinum and, rarely, by related species (Clostridium baratii and Clostridium butyricum). The botulinum neurotoxin inhibits acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle paralysis.
- **Epidemiology**: In 2019, the CDC has reported 219 cases of botulism in the US.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for botulism include ingestion of contaminated food, bacterial colonization of a wound, or the intestines (as in infant botulism and adult intestinal colonization botulism). High-concentration cosmetic or therapeutic injections of toxin can also lead to botulism (iatrogenic botulism).
- **Disease course**: Botulism progresses over hours to several days following toxin exposure. Neurologic symptoms typically begin within 12–36 hours but can be delayed up to several days depending on toxin dose and route of exposure. Early signs include blurred vision, diplopia, ptosis, dysarthria, dysphagia, and dry mouth, reflecting cranial nerve involvement. These are followed by progressive, symmetric, descending flaccid paralysis involving the respiratory, axial, and limb muscles. In foodborne botulism, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort often precede neurologic deficits by several hours. Vomiting occurs in up to 50% of cases. Infants may present with constipation, hypotonia, weak cry, and poor feeding within 3–30 days of ingesting contaminated food. Proximal muscles are typically affected before distal ones, though exceptions occur. Asymmetric neurologic findings are reported in 6–15% of cases. Respiratory failure typically develops several days after symptom onset and is preceded by bulbar weakness. Rarely, respiratory failure is the initial manifestation. Recovery, often over weeks to months, occurs in reverse order of symptom appearance. Atypical or nonspecific initial presentations, such as gastrointestinal complaints or nonspecific weakness, may delay diagnosis.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of botulism is generally good with appropriate medical care, which includes supportive care, intubation, mechanical ventilation when necessary, and administration of botulinum antitoxin.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines on anaphylaxis [^11521twJ]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Treatment — general considerations and decontamination: As with any potentially serious illness or injury in the field, care begins with an assessment of scene safety followed by a primary evaluation of the patient with interventions as needed to support airway, breathing, and circulation, and epinephrine should be given as soon as possible once anaphylaxis has been identified. Removal of the inciting allergen is appropriate in certain circumstances, such as immediately removing an insect stinger from the skin to prevent additional injection of venom (avoiding pressure, if possible, on the venom sac). Exposure to aerosolized, food-based allergens should be stopped by discontinuing on-site cooking of the associated food and, if feasible, distancing of the patient, and inducing vomiting for food-based allergens has not been proven effective and may delay treatment with epinephrine.

### Amanita poisonings resulting in acute, reversible renal failure: new cases, new toxic amanita mushrooms [^111JasYi]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Renal failure as a consequence of eating mushrooms has been reported repeatedly after ingestion of webcaps of the Cortinarius orellanus group. But mushrooms of the genus Amanita can also cause renal failure: Amanita smithiana (North America) and Amanita proxima (Mediterranean area). Here, we discuss poisonings caused by other white amanitas. A German and — independently — two Portuguese patients reported the ingestion of completely white mushrooms with ring. Similar to intoxications with A. smithiana or A. proxima, the clinical picture was characterized by nausea and vomiting 10–12 h after ingestion, severe acute renal failure and mild hepatitis. Renal biopsy showed acute interstitial nephritis and tubular necrosis. Two patients were given temporary haemodialysis. All have fully recovered their renal function. Poisonings caused by mushrooms containing the toxin of A. smithiana were suspected. We tested 20 Amanita species for the presence of this toxin.

Methods

Thin layer chromatography was applied to detect A. smithiana nephrotoxin in herbarium specimens using authentic material of A. smithiana as reference.

Results

A. smithiana toxin could be detected in Amanita boudieri, Amanita gracilior and in Amanita echinocephala. A. boudieri was collected by the Portuguese patients. A. echinocephala is the only nephrotoxic Amanita growing North of the Alps and is suspected to be the cause of renal failure in the German patient. No A. smithiana toxin was detectable in the nephrotoxic A. proxima.

Conclusions

A. boudieri, A. gracilior and A. echinocephala are nephrotoxic. These intoxications are clinically similar to that of A. smithiana, with acute reversible renal failure and mild hepatitis but are different in their clinical picture from Orellanus syndrome characterized by a delayed onset of severe and often irreversible renal failure.

### Timing of liver transplantation for pediatric acute liver failure due to mushroom poisoning: a case report and literature review [^1171bdSF]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Escudie et al. and Ganzert et al. studied specific criteria to assess the need for transplantation in patients with amatoxin poisoning; however, these criteria for LT are not universally accepted. The decision of LT for this patient took into account the rapid progression of the disease, poor response to treatment and high LIU score. In the future, it is expected that there will be an accurate prediction model for PALF due to mushroom poisoning.

In this study, we did not identify the causative mushroom due to the lack of laboratory equipment. In China, the identification of mushroom species consumed by patients is difficult in most hospitals. The history of mushroom ingestion is essential for diagnosis. Therefore, the patient was suspected to have ingested amatoxin-containing mushrooms.

In conclusion, mushroom poisoning can induce PALF and result in a very poor prognosis without PLT. Early identification and diagnosis of PALF is important. It is necessary to transfer patients with PALF to a hospital with a LT center as early as possible. Once conservative treatment fails, LT should be carried out. At present, optimal prognostic criteria to predict death in PALF patients without LT are still lacking. In order to find the best timing for LT, the best solution is that clinicians with experience in PALF and LT continuously evaluate the possibility of spontaneous recovery in combination with etiology and response to treatment.

### Mechanisms of toxicity of cleistanthus collinus: vacuolar ATPases are a putative target [^112VuZ34]. Clinical Toxicology (2011). Low credibility.

Ingestion of Cleistanthus collinus, a shrub native to South India, either intentionally or accidentally, is a common cause of death in the area. Consumption of a boiled decoction of leaves is highly toxic, but medical management of patients is mainly supportive because the molecular mechanisms of toxin action are unknown. Distal renal tubular acidosis is one of the symptoms of poisoning in patients and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) requiring proton pumps is important for acid secretion in the kidney. Hence, we hypothesized that these may be putative targets for C. collinus action and we tested this by exposing rat renal brush border membrane (BBM) as well as cultured kidney cells to a boiled decoction of C. collinus. Exposure to the C. collinus decoction resulted in significant inhibition of vacuolar type H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) activity in renal BBM as well as blocking of the proton pump in renal BBM vesicles. C. collinus decoction was also found to inhibit acidification of intracellular organelles in cells in culture, similar to the effect seen with either bafilomycin or concanamycin - specific inhibitors of the V-ATPase. This was accompanied by a decrease in V-ATPase activity, but an increase in protein levels. These results demonstrate that the V-ATPase in renal cells is a putative target for the toxins in C. collinus and the inhibition of this important proton pump probably plays a role in the development of distal renal tubular acidosis and subsequent renal failure seen in poisoned patients.

All persons who consumed the mushrooms developed nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea approximately 9 hours after ingestion. The mother, father and child (patients B, C, and D) visited the ED 20 hours after ingestion with dehydration and gastrointestinal distress. All patients had laboratory values consistent with hepatic injury (Table). The patients were treated with aggressive IV fluid hydration, IV octreotide, and IV silibinin. Two days after ingestion of the mushrooms, the mother's LFTs peaked at AST 11,427, ALT 9,693, total bilirubin 2.4 mg/dL, and INR 3.2 units. The father's LFTs peaked on hospital day 1 with AST 6,123 IU/L, ALT 4,401 IU/L, and total bilirubin 2.8 on hospital day 2. Both parents' symptoms improved, and they were discharged on hospital days 6 and 4, respectively. The child developed irreversible fulminant hepatic failure and required mechanical ventilation because of hepatic encephalopathy. She underwent a liver transplant 6 days after ingestion of the mushroom with a complicated postoperative course that included cerebral edema and permanent neurologic impairment.

The sister of the woman who prepared the meal (patient E) visited the ED before her other family members, but was discharged home after administration of IV fluids and antiemetic medications, with a diagnosis of gastroenteritis. She returned to the ED the following day with persistent nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping. At that time, her AST was 1,712 IU/L, ALT 1,025 IU/L, total bilirubin 2.0 mg/dL, and INR 1.8 units. She was treated with aggressive IV fluid hydration, IV octreotide, and IV silibinin, as well as the placement of a biliary drain, but developed irreversible fulminant hepatic failure and underwent liver transplant on hospital day 4, with subsequent improvement of her hepatic function.

### Clinical features and outcome of patients with amatoxin-containing mushroom poisoning [^116V5iQf]. Clinical Toxicology (2011). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE. We aimed to determine clinical and laboratory findings that were different between those patients who died and those who survived and to look for factors associated with the mortality in amatoxin-containing mushroom poisoning. METHODS. The mushroom poisoning patients who were admitted to our clinic between 1996 and 2009 were retrospectively evaluated. The diagnosis was based on a history of mushroom ingestion, clinical picture and the presence of serum alpha-amanitin. Patients were divided into two groups as the survival group and the fatality group. Clinical and laboratory findings were compared between the two groups. Relation between variables and clinical outcome was analyzed. RESULTS. A total of 144 amatoxin poisoning patients were included in this study. Patients who died were more likely to have demonstrated low mean arterial pressure, encephalopathy, mucosal hemorrhage, oliguria-anuria, hypoglycemia, and thrombocytopenia during the hospitalization. Low sodium values and high urea, AST, ALT, total bilirubin, LDH, prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, and activated partial thromboplastin time values were associated with increased likelihood of mortality. Nineteen patients developed acute renal failure. Fourteen patients developed acute hepatic failure. All the 14 patients who died developed acute hepatic failure. The mortality rate was 9.7%. CONCLUSIONS. The factors associated with mortality determined in this retrospective study may be helpful for clinical outcome assessment and monitoring of patients with amatoxin-containing mushroom poisoning.

### Amanita phalloides mushroom poisonings-Northern california… [^1167Py2a]. CDC (2019). Medium credibility.

What is added by this report. In December 2016, fourteen cases of Amanita phalloides poisoning were identified by the California Poison Control System among persons who had consumed foraged wild mushrooms. In the past few years before this outbreak, CPCS only received reports of a few mushroom poisoning cases per year. All patients in this outbreak had gastrointestinal manifestations of intoxication leading to dehydration and hepatotoxicity. Three patients received liver transplants; all patients recovered, although one had permanent neurologic impairment. What are the implications for public health practice. Wild-picked mushrooms should be evaluated by a trained mycologist before ingestion. Inexperienced foragers should be strongly discouraged from eating any wild mushrooms.

Health care providers should be aware of the potential for toxicity after wild mushroom ingestion, that gastrointestinal symptoms mimicking viral gastroenteritis can occur after ingestion and slowly progress to potentially fatal hepatotoxicity, and should contact the local poison center for reporting and assistance with management of these patients. A summary of 14 reported cases is presented here. Data extracted from patient medical charts revealed a pattern of delayed gastrointestinal manifestations of intoxication leading to dehydration and hepatotoxicity. Three patients received liver transplants and all but one recovered completely. The morbidity and potential lethality associated with A. phalloides ingestion are serious public health concerns and warrant medical provider education and dissemination of information cautioning against consuming foraged wild mushrooms. Initial case. A man aged 37 years picked two wild mushrooms in Santa Rosa, California.

He cooked and ate one mushroom, and approximately 10 hours later developed nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. He was evaluated in a local emergency department for abdominal discomfort 20. 5 hours after ingestion. A mycologist identified the uncooked mushroom sample provided by the patient as A. phalloides. Initial laboratory findings were notable for an elevated white blood cell count with lactate elevation and elevated creatinine suggesting dehydration. Liver function tests 6 hours later showed elevated aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels. Gastrointestinal symptoms and laboratory values gradually improved, and the patient was discharged home on day 6. Household cluster.

A woman aged 26 years prepared and grilled wild mushrooms for dinner for her husband, her daughter, her sister, and a female friend. The mushrooms had been given to her by a person she did not know, who reportedly picked them earlier in the day in the mountains. The mother, father, and child ate four, three, and one-half mushroom caps, respectively; the mother's sister ate one cap and stalk, and the friend ate "pieces". All persons who consumed the mushrooms developed nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea approximately 9 hours after ingestion. The mother, father and child visited the ED 20 hours after ingestion with dehydration and gastrointestinal distress. All patients had laboratory values consistent with hepatic injury. The patients were treated with aggressive IV fluid hydration, IV octreotide, and IV silibinin.

### Mushroom poisoning [^1157oDQA]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Mushroom poisoning is poisoning resulting from the ingestion of mushrooms that contain toxic substances. Symptoms can vary from slight gastrointestinal discomfort to death in about 10 days. Mushroom toxins are secondary metabolites produced by the fungus. Mushroom poisoning is usually the result of ingestion of wild mushrooms after misidentification of a toxic mushroom as an edible species. The most common reason for this misidentification is a close resemblance in terms of color and general morphology of the toxic mushrooms species with edible species. To prevent mushroom poisoning, mushroom gatherers familiarize themselves with the mushrooms they intend to collect, as well as with any similar-looking toxic species. The safety of eating wild mushrooms may depend on methods of preparation for cooking. Some toxins, such as amatoxins, are thermostable and mushrooms containing such toxins will not be rendered safe to eat by cooking.

Signs and symptoms Poisonous mushrooms contain a variety of different toxins that can differ markedly in toxicity. Symptoms of mushroom poisoning may vary from gastric upset to organ failure resulting in death. Serious symptoms do not always occur immediately after eating, often not until the toxin attacks the kidney or liver, sometimes days or weeks later. The most common consequence of mushroom poisoning is simply gastrointestinal upset. Most "poisonous" mushrooms contain gastrointestinal irritants that cause vomiting and diarrhea, but usually no long-term damage. However, there are a number of recognized mushroom toxins with specific, and sometimes deadly, effects: The period between ingestion and the onset of symptoms varies dramatically between toxins, some taking days to show symptoms identifiable as mushroom poisoning.
- **α-Amanitin**: For 6–12 hours, there are no symptoms.

This is followed by a period of gastrointestinal upset. This stage is caused primarily by the phallotoxins and typically lasts 24 hours. At the end of this second stage is when severe liver damage begins. The damage may continue for another 2–3 days. Kidney damage can also occur. Some patients will require a liver transplant. Amatoxins are found in some mushrooms in the genus Amanita, but are also found in some species of Galerina and Lepiota. Overall, mortality is between 10 and 15 percent. Recently, Silybum marianum or blessed milk thistle has been shown to protect the liver from amanita toxins and promote regrowth of damaged cells.
- **Orellanine**: This toxin generally causes no symptoms for 3–20 days after ingestion. Typically around day 11, the process of kidney failure begins, and is usually symptomatic by day 20. These symptoms can include pain in the area of the kidneys, thirst, vomiting, headache, and fatigue.
- **Muscarine**: Muscarine stimulates the muscarinic receptors of the nerves and muscles. Symptoms include sweating, salivation, tears, blurred vision, palpitations, and, in high doses, respiratory failure. Muscarine is found in mushrooms of the genus Omphalotus, notably the jack o' Lantern mushrooms.
- **Gyromitrin**: Stomach acids convert gyromitrin to monomethylhydrazine. It affects multiple body systems. It blocks the important neurotransmitter GABA, leading to stupor, delirium, muscle cramps, loss of coordination, tremors, and/or seizures. It causes severe gastrointestinal irritation, leading to vomiting and diarrhea. In some cases, liver failure has been reported. It can also cause red blood cells to break down, leading to jaundice, kidney failure, and signs of anemia. It is found in mushrooms of the genus Gyromitra. A gyromitrin-like compound has also been identified in mushrooms of the genus Verpa.

These toxic mushrooms resemble several edible species commonly consumed by humans, increasing the risk of accidental poisoning. Amatoxins, the class of toxins found in these mushrooms, are thermostable: they resist changes due to heat and cold, so their toxic effects are not reduced by cooking nor freezing. Amanita phalloides is the most poisonous of all known mushrooms. It is estimated that as little as half a mushroom contains enough toxin to kill an adult human. It is also the deadliest mushroom worldwide, responsible for 90% of mushroom-related fatalities every year. It has been involved in the majority of human deaths from mushroom poisoning, possibly including Roman Emperor Claudius in AD 54 and Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI in 1740.

Biochemistry The species is now known to contain two main groups of toxins, both multicyclic peptides spread throughout the mushroom, tissue: the amatoxins and the phallotoxins. Another toxin is phallolysin, which has shown some hemolytic activity in vitro. An unrelated compound, antamanide, has also been isolated. It may have also been anthropogenically introduced to the island of Cyprus, where it has been documented to fruit within Corylus avellana plantations. Toxicity The fungus is highly toxic, and is responsible for the majority of fatal mushroom poisonings worldwide. Its biochemistry has been researched intensively for decades, and 30 grams, or half a cap, of this mushroom is estimated to be enough to kill a human. On average, one person dies a year in North America from death cap ingestion. The toxins of the death cap mushrooms primarily target the liver, but other organs, such as the kidneys, are also affected.

Symptoms of death cap mushroom toxicity usually occur 6 to 12 hours after ingestion. Symptoms of ingestion of the death cap mushroom may include nausea and vomiting, which is then followed by jaundice, seizures, and coma, which will lead to death. The mortality rate of ingestion of the death cap mushroom is believed to be around 10–30%. Poisoning incidents usually result from errors in identification. Recent cases highlight the issue of the similarity of A. phalloides to the edible paddy straw mushroom, with East and Southeast Asian immigrants in Australia and the West Coast of the U. S. falling victim. In an episode in Oregon, four members of a Korean family required liver transplants.

In January 2012, four people were accidentally poisoned when death caps were served for dinner in Canberra; all the victims required hospital treatment and two of them died, with a third requiring a liver transplant. Detection The so-called Meixner test is used to detect the presence of amatoxins in a sample. The test gives false positive results for psilocin, psilocybin, and 5-substituted tryptamines. Signs and symptoms Death caps have been reported to taste pleasant. This, coupled with the delay in the appearance of symptoms — during which time internal organs are being severely, sometimes irreparably, damaged — makes them particularly dangerous.
