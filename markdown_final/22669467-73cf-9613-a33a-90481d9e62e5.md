## Question

A 29-year-old woman undergoes a spontaneous vaginal delivery. During the birth, shoulder dystocia is encountered and managed successfully with the McRoberts maneuver and suprapubic pressure. The baby is delivered with an Apgar score of 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes. There is no apparent neonatal injury. After the delivery, you are the junior doctor assisting the attending obstetrician, who asks you to complete the delivery notes.

According to RCOG guidelines, what is the most important principle to follow when documenting this case of shoulder dystocia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the most important principle is for documenting a shoulder dystocia case according to RCOG guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which RCOG guideline specifically addresses documentation. Then, I should verify whether RCOG provides a hierarchy of documentation priorities or if multiple principles are emphasized equally. Next, I will compare RCOG with ACOG guidance to ensure I'm not conflating recommendations. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, reference-backed answer that identifies the single most important principle and why it matters clinically and medicolegally.

> Let me first confirm the source document. RCOG Green-top Guideline No. 42 on shoulder dystocia explicitly includes a section on quality improvement that emphasizes documentation, and it states that teams should ensure accurate and comprehensive documentation of the event, which is the clearest directive from RCOG on this topic [^2b547e96].

> Wait, let me verify whether RCOG ranks documentation elements or states a single most important principle. I need to check the guideline text carefully. RCOG does not provide a ranked list of documentation elements; rather, it emphasizes that documentation should be accurate and comprehensive, and it links this to quality improvement and medicolegal clarity, which implies that completeness and accuracy are the overarching principles rather than any single data point being paramount [^2b547e96].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should compare this with ACOG to ensure I'm not importing a different priority. ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 178 repeatedly stresses contemporaneous documentation of the management of shoulder dystocia to record significant facts, findings, and observations, which reinforces the principle of timely, thorough documentation rather than elevating one element above others, and it also notes that checklists can help ensure critical information is captured at the time of delivery [^65f170f6] [^bc63248c].

> I will now examine what "accurate and comprehensive" typically entails in practice, even if RCOG does not rank items. Key elements consistently associated with high-quality documentation include: recognition and announcement of shoulder dystocia, time stamps (notably head-to-body interval), maneuvers performed and in what sequence, personnel involved, maternal and neonatal outcomes, and any injuries or complications; standardized forms and checklists improve capture of these elements, which aligns with the principle of comprehensiveness emphasized by RCOG and ACOG [^e13056d6] [^6bd159e9] [^4b53d0db].

> But wait, what if someone argues that timing is the single most important element? Let me reconsider. While the head-to-body interval is frequently highlighted for clinical and medicolegal reasons, RCOG does not explicitly rank it above other components; instead, it situates timing within the broader mandate for accurate and comprehensive documentation, so I should avoid asserting a hierarchy that the guideline does not specify [^2b547e96].

> Synthesis: The most important principle per RCOG is to ensure accurate and comprehensive documentation of the shoulder dystocia event, capturing all significant facts, findings, and observations in a timely manner; this principle encompasses precise timing, sequence of maneuvers, personnel, and outcomes, and it is the foundation for quality improvement, communication, and medicolegal clarity [^2b547e96] [^65f170f6].

---

The most important principle when documenting shoulder dystocia is to **record the event contemporaneously** [^65f170f6] with a **structured, comprehensive account** of the diagnosis, maneuvers, timing, personnel, and outcomes [^bc63248c]. This ensures clinical accuracy, supports communication, and meets medico-legal standards [^49d29e85]. RCOG emphasizes that documentation should be **accurate and comprehensive** [^2b547e96], capturing the diagnosis, sequence of maneuvers, timing, staff involved, and maternal and neonatal outcomes [^bc63248c]. Contemporaneous recording is critical because delays lead to omissions and inaccuracies [^65f170f6].

---

## Key elements of documentation

According to RCOG and ACOG, the following elements are **essential** in the documentation of shoulder dystocia:

- **Diagnosis and recognition**: Clearly state the diagnosis of shoulder dystocia and the clinical signs that prompted recognition, such as failure of delivery of the shoulders after gentle traction and the "turtle sign" [^ed39903f].

- **Time recording**: Document the exact time of recognition of shoulder dystocia and the total head-to-body delivery interval [^92afb1b1]. This timing is critical for assessing the duration of the emergency and correlating with neonatal outcomes [^0ca44971].

- **Maneuvers performed**: Record the sequence of maneuvers used, including McRoberts maneuver, suprapubic pressure, internal rotational maneuvers, delivery of the posterior arm, and any additional interventions such as episiotomy or fundal pressure [^67c08d85] [^b645c0b4] [^27c4bf42] [^1ee8cdf8].

- **Personnel involved**: Document the names and roles of all healthcare professionals involved in the management of the emergency, including obstetricians, midwives, nurses, and neonatologists [^92afb1b1].

- **Maternal and neonatal outcomes**: Record maternal complications such as postpartum hemorrhage, third or fourth-degree perineal lacerations, and neonatal outcomes including Apgar scores, presence of brachial plexus injury, clavicular or humeral fractures, and any resuscitation required [^504be945].

- **Communication with the patient**: Document the explanation provided to the patient and her family regarding the events of the delivery, including the diagnosis, management, and potential implications for future pregnancies [^71fbb7c5].

---

## Importance of contemporaneous documentation

Contemporaneous documentation is emphasized by RCOG and ACOG as a **critical principle** [^65f170f6]. Recording events immediately after they occur ensures accuracy, completeness, and reliability of the medical record [^bc63248c]. Delayed documentation increases the risk of omissions, inaccuracies, and inconsistencies, which can compromise clinical care, communication, and medico-legal defensibility [^49d29e85].

---

## Consequences of inadequate documentation

Inadequate or incomplete documentation of shoulder dystocia can have **significant consequences**, including:

- **Compromised clinical care**: Incomplete records can hinder continuity of care, leading to potential errors in subsequent management and follow-up [^bc63248c].

- **Legal implications**: Poor documentation is a common factor in medico-legal claims and litigation, often resulting in unfavorable outcomes for healthcare providers [^49d29e85].

- **Loss of critical information**: Failure to document key details such as timing, maneuvers, and personnel involved can result in loss of essential information for future reference and quality improvement initiatives [^e13056d6].

---

## Use of standardized documentation tools

To facilitate comprehensive and accurate documentation, RCOG and ACOG recommend the use of **standardized documentation tools** such as checklists or electronic templates [^bc63248c]. These tools ensure that all critical elements are captured consistently and reduce the risk of omissions [^e13056d6]. Implementation of such tools has been shown to significantly improve the quality of documentation in shoulder dystocia cases [^6bd159e9].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Documentation element** | **Importance** |
|-|-|
| Diagnosis and recognition | Essential for clinical accuracy and communication |
| Time recording | Critical for assessing duration and correlating with outcomes |
| Maneuvers performed | Essential for understanding management and identifying areas for improvement |
| Personnel involved | Important for accountability and communication |
| Maternal and neonatal outcomes | Essential for clinical care and medico-legal purposes |
| Communication with patient | Important for patient-centered care and informed decision-making |

---

The most important principle when documenting shoulder dystocia is to **record the event contemporaneously** [^65f170f6] with a **structured, comprehensive account** of the diagnosis, maneuvers, timing, personnel, and outcomes [^bc63248c]. This ensures clinical accuracy, supports communication, and meets medico-legal standards [^49d29e85].

Our objective was to compare national guidelines regarding shoulder dystocia. Along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) practice bulletin on shoulder dystocia, guidelines from England, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand were reviewed. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) guideline agrees with the ACOG definition of shoulder dystocia, but there are variances in the management of suspected macrosomia and resolution of impacted shoulders. How recommendations are categorized differ also. Only 53% (20 of 38) of eligible references are cited by both publications. The two national guidelines on shoulder dystocia have differences and disagreements with each other, raising concerns about how the literature is synthesized and which is more comprehensive.

Shoulder dystocia — summary of recommendations (Level B): The following recommendations are based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence (Level B). Although there are a number of known risk factors, shoulder dystocia cannot be accurately predicted or prevented, and clinicians should be aware of the risk factors to anticipate high-risk deliveries and be prepared to address this complication in all deliveries. Elective cesarean delivery should be considered for women without diabetes who are carrying fetuses with suspected macrosomia with an estimated fetal weight of at least 5,000 g and for women with diabetes whose fetuses are estimated to weigh at least 4,500 g. When shoulder dystocia is suspected, the McRoberts maneuver should be attempted first because it is a simple, logical, and effective technique. Contemporaneous documentation of the management of shoulder dystocia is recommended to record significant facts, findings, and observations about the shoulder dystocia event and its sequelae. Simulation exercises and shoulder dystocia protocols are recommended to improve team communication and maneuver use because this may reduce the incidence of brachial plexus palsy associated with shoulder dystocia.

Most of our knowledge pertaining to this obstetric emergency has emanated from case reports and retrospective studies that have subsequently resulted in empirical management protocols. This article has identified the existence of large gaps in our clinical knowledge base regarding the prevention and resolution of shoulder dystocia, as well as its long-term sequelae. We have attempted to challenge current recommendations regarding whether prophylactic cesarean delivery should be performed based on estimated fetal weight alone or a prior history of shoulder dystocia, shoulder dystocia management techniques, what defines "excessive" traction, and the role of simulation training for all clinicians.

### Shoulder dystocia: an update [^eadc3c42]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Shoulder dystocia has no consensus definition or management algorithm. Its incidence ranges from 0.2% to 3% and its occurrence is unpredictable. Risk factors for shoulder dystocia may include macrosomia, maternal diabetes, operative vaginal delivery, history of macrosomic infant or shoulder dystocia, labor abnormalities, post-term pregnancy, maternal obesity, advanced maternal age, fetal anthropometric variations, and male fetal gender. Once identified, multiple maneuvers can be applied in a stepwise fashion in an attempt to alleviate the dystocia. While training clinicians to manage shoulder dystocia is difficult because of its rare occurrence and lack of standardized management, all clinicians must be able to manage shoulder dystocia at any time.

Timing of delivery and induction for suspected macrosomia — guideline statements and uncertainty. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends against delivery before 39 completed weeks of gestation if not medically indicated, and whether induction is better than expectant management or what gestational age to deliver remains unclear. Although a meta-analysis is provocative, it is not clear that reduction in shoulder dystocia would persist if labor were induced after 39 weeks of gestation. At this time, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists continues to discourage induction of labor solely for suspected macrosomia at any gestational age.

### Shoulder dystocia: management and documentation [^cf96a0a7]. Seminars in Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

Shoulder dystocia is an obstetric emergency that occurs when the fetal shoulders become impacted at the pelvic inlet. Management is based on performing maneuvers to alleviate this impaction. A number of protocols and training mnemonics have been developed to assist in managing shoulder dystocia when it occurs. This article reviews the evidence regarding the performance, timing, and sequence of these maneuvers; reviews the mechanism of fetal injury in relation to shoulder dystocia; and discusses issues concerning documentation of the care provided during this obstetric emergency.

### Shoulder dystocia: definitions and incidence [^f7ab78df]. Seminars in Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

Though subjective in nature, both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists practice bulletin and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists green guideline are in agreement on the descriptor of shoulder dystocia: requirement of additional obstetric maneuvers when gentle downward traction has failed to affect the delivery of the shoulders. The rate of shoulder dystocia is about 1.4% of all deliveries and 0.7% for vaginal births. Compared to non-diabetics (0.6%), among diabetics, the rate of impacted shoulders is 201% higher (1.9%); newborns delivered by vacuum or forceps have 254% higher likelihood of shoulder dystocia than those born spontaneously (2.0% vs. 0.6%, respectively). When the birthweight is categorized as < 4000, 4000–4449, and > 4500 g, the likelihood of shoulder dystocia in the US vs. other countries varies significantly. Future studies should focus on lowering the rate of shoulder dystocia and its associated morbidities, without concomitantly increasing the rate of cesarean delivery.

Shoulder dystocia — risk of recurrence and delivery planning: Prior shoulder dystocia is identified as "a risk factor for recurrent shoulder dystocia," with reports indicating "the recurrence rate ranges from 1% to 16.7%," and "most studies report the incidence of recurrence to be at least 10%." For patients with this history, "the prior delivery events should be discussed with the patient, preferably before the intrapartum period," and "the estimated fetal weight, gestational age, maternal glucose intolerance, and the severity of the prior neonatal injury should be evaluated." Counseling should include that "universal elective cesarean delivery is not recommended for patients who have a history of shoulder dystocia," yet "careful delivery planning is recommended, taking into account available clinical information, future pregnancy plans, and patient preference."

### Practice bulletin No 178: shoulder dystocia [^ed39903f]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Shoulder dystocia — background and diagnosis — shoulder dystocia is an unpredictable and unpreventable obstetric emergency that places the pregnant woman and fetus at risk of injury, and prepregnancy, antepartum, and intrapartum risk factors have extremely poor predictive value for shoulder dystocia; several techniques to facilitate delivery exist, and there is evidence that a systematic approach and simulation training can improve outcomes and documentation. It typically occurs when the descent of the anterior shoulder is obstructed by the symphysis pubis, but it also can result from impaction of the posterior shoulder on the maternal sacral promontory, and it is most commonly diagnosed as failure to deliver the fetal shoulder(s) with gentle downward traction on the fetal head, requiring additional obstetric maneuvers to effect delivery; retraction of the delivered fetal head against the maternal perineum (the "turtle sign") is suggestive, but not diagnostic, of the presence of shoulder dystocia. The reported incidence of shoulder dystocia among vaginal deliveries of fetuses in the vertex presentation ranges from 0.2% to 3%.

### Catastrophic shoulder dystocia [^342d46b6]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this paper is to outline in a stepwise fashion a life-saving management sequence for catastrophic shoulder dystocia.

Method

Five cases of catastrophic shoulder dystocia are analyzed to determine optimal management when confronted with this terrifying obstetric complication.

Result

The management of these five cases reveals the importance of the early use of uterine relaxing agents and general anesthesia. A second physician is also ideal. The absence of a nuchal cord may result in more favorable outcomes.

Conclusion

The key to achieving improved outcomes when confronted with catastrophic shoulder dystocia include (1) immediate availability of an operating room and anesthesia personnel, (2) the willingness to use uterine relaxing agents, (3) the availability of a second physician, (4) an understanding of the best sequence of remedial measures to follow, (5) total delivery within 12–13 min of the delivery of the head (almost impossible when the delivery process begins in a birthing room) and (6) a cesarean room should be considered for delivery of all massively obese women.

### Outcomes associated with introduction of a shoulder dystocia protocol [^6bd159e9]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess outcomes that are associated with the implementation of a shoulder dystocia protocol that is focused on team response. We identified women who had a shoulder dystocia during 3 time periods: 6 months before (period A), 6 months during (period B), and 6 months after (period C) the institution of a shoulder dystocia protocol. Documentation and health outcomes were compared among the time periods. During the study period, 254 women (77, 100, and 77 in periods A, B, and C, respectively) had a shoulder dystocia. There were no differences among study periods in patient characteristics. However, complete and consistent documentation increased (14% to 50% to 92%; P < .001), and brachial plexus palsy that was diagnosed at delivery (10.1% to 4.0% to 2.6%; P = 0.03) and at neonatal discharge (7.6% to 3.0% to 1.3%; P = 0.04) declined.

Shoulder dystocia remains an unpredictable obstetric emergency, striking fear in the hearts of obstetricians both novice and experienced. While outcomes that lead to permanent injury are rare, almost all obstetricians with enough years of practice have participated in a birth with a severe shoulder dystocia and are at least aware of cases that have resulted in significant neurologic injury or even neonatal death. This is despite many years of research trying to understand the risk factors associated with it, all in an attempt primarily to characterize when the risk is high enough to avoid vaginal delivery altogether and prevent a shoulder dystocia, whose attendant morbidities are estimated to be at a rate as high as 16–48%. The study of shoulder dystocia remains challenging due to its generally retrospective nature, as well as dependence on proper identification and documentation. As a result, the prediction of shoulder dystocia remains elusive, and the cost of trying to prevent one by performing a cesarean delivery remains high. While ultimately it is the injury that is the key concern, rather than the shoulder dystocia itself, it is in the presence of an identified shoulder dystocia that occurrence of injury is most common. The majority of shoulder dystocia cases occur without major risk factors. Moreover, even the best antenatal predictors have a low positive predictive value. Shoulder dystocia therefore cannot be reliably predicted, and the only preventative measure is cesarean delivery.

Shoulder dystocia duration and fetal compromise — The duration of the shoulder dystocia alone is not an accurate predictor of neonatal asphyxia or death. In a series of neonatal deaths associated with shoulder dystocia, the head-body delivery interval was less than 5 minutes in 47% of cases of death and only 20% had a head–body interval of greater than 10 minutes, and fetal compromise was present before delivery in 25% of these cases; the authors concluded that intrapartum factors and differing mechanisms of injury may contribute.

### Shoulder dystocia: the unpreventable obstetric emergency with empiric management guidelines [^641f0f27]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Much of our understanding and knowledge of shoulder dystocia has been blurred by inconsistent and scientific studies that are of limited scientific quality. In an evidence-based format, we sought to answer the following questions: (1) Is shoulder dystocia predictable? (2) Can shoulder dystocia be prevented? (3) When shoulder dystocia does occur, what maneuvers should be performed? and (4) What are the sequelae of shoulder dystocia?

Study Design

Electronic databases, including PUBMED and the Cochrane Database, were searched using the key word "shoulder dystocia". We also performed a manual review of articles included in the bibliographies of these selected articles to further define articles for review. Only those articles published in the English language were eligible for inclusion.

Results

There is a significantly increased risk of shoulder dystocia as birth weight linearly increases. From a prospective point of view, however, prepregnancy and antepartum risk factors have exceedingly poor predictive value for the prediction of shoulder dystocia. Late pregnancy ultrasound likewise displays low sensitivity, decreasing accuracy with increasing birth weight, and an overall tendency to overestimate the birth weight. Induction of labor for suspected fetal macrosomia has not been shown to alter the incidence of shoulder dystocia among nondiabetic patients. The concept of prophylactic cesarean delivery as a means to prevent shoulder dystocia and therefore avoid brachial plexus injury has not been supported by either clinical or theoretic data. Although many maneuvers have been described for the successful alleviation of shoulder dystocia, there have been no randomized controlled trials or laboratory experiments that have directly compared these techniques. Despite the introduction of ancillary obstetric maneuvers, such as McRoberts maneuver and a generalized trend towards the avoidance of fundal pressure, it has been shown that the rate of shoulder-dystocia associated brachial plexus palsy has not decreased. The simple occurrence of a shoulder dystocia event before any iatrogenic intervention may be associated with brachial plexus injury.

Conclusion

For many years, long-standing opinions based solely on empiric reasoning have dictated our understanding of the detailed aspects of shoulder dystocia prevention and management. Despite its infrequent occurrence, all healthcare providers attending pregnancies must be prepared to handle vaginal deliveries complicated by shoulder dystocia.

Shoulder dystocia — episiotomy use: The routine use of episiotomy in the management of all shoulder dystocia cases has been advocated in the past, but with little scientific evidence to support the practice. The use of episiotomy should be based on clinical circumstances and is primarily reserved for cases in which additional access is needed to perform maneuvers because an incision into the soft tissue of the vagina and perineum will not resolve an impaction of the bony fetal shoulder(s). When direct fetal manipulation with either rotational maneuvers or delivery of the posterior arm is implemented, episiotomy may be helpful to create more room within the posterior vagina.

### Neonatal resuscitation assessment: documentation and early paging must be improved! [^14a7362d]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2012). Low credibility.

According to national clinical guidelines in obstetrics, the paediatrician should be paged before a birth in cases of imminent asphyxia, in breech and instrumental deliveries, and immediately when deliveries are complicated by shoulder dystocia. In cases of unexpected asphyxia, the target time for the arrival of skilled assistance was set at being within 4 min after birth for a paediatrician and 15 min for a neonatologist.

According to guidelines used during in the study period (revised late in 2006 and again in 2009), clearing the airways from meconium and initiating bag and mask ventilation with initially 40% oxygen should be performed immediately on all newborns with a heart rate below 100 beats/min (bpm). In cases of asystolia, endotracheal intubation and the administration of thoracic compressions should be performed immediately. Early intubation (within 2–3 min after birth) was recommended in cases with persistent bradycardia to ensure free airways and satisfactory ventilation. Administration of adrenalin was recommended if the heart rate did not rise despite satisfactory ventilation. Correction of metabolic acidosis should be performed in cases of refractory bradycardia and terminal apnoea. Interruption of resuscitation was to be considered, if there was no evidence of heart activity after 15 min or if no spontaneous breathing or body movements had occurred during the first 30 min after birth.

Based on these guidelines, we established failure events in conjunction with neonatal resuscitation, summarised in figure 1.

Indications for episiotomy — contemporary practice and recommendation: Contemporary data indicate that there are insufficient objective evidence-based criteria to define the indications for episiotomy — and specifically routine use of episiotomy — and that restrictive use of episiotomy remains the best practice. Although some guidelines have suggested an episiotomy to allow for additional access for maneuvers when shoulder dystocia is encountered, a systematic review found no evidence that supported the use of episiotomy. A randomized controlled trial of restrictive versus routine mediolateral episiotomy at operative vaginal delivery found no significant differences between groups in rates of OASIS, postpartum hemorrhage, or neonatal trauma, and its longitudinal prospective follow-up at 1-year postpartum found no differences in urinary morbidities, incontinence, or dyspareunia. Based on the existing evidence, there are no specific situations in which episiotomy is essential, the decision should be based on clinical considerations, and restrictive episiotomy use is recommended over routine episiotomy.

### First and second stage labor management: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 8 [^b1b8bdc7]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). High credibility.

Active phase arrest of labor — ACOG recommends that cesarean delivery be performed in patients with active phase arrest of labor (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). Active phase arrest is defined as absence of cervical change during the active phase of labor with 4 cm or greater cervical dilation for at least 2 hours in the presence of adequate uterine contractions (200 MVUs or greater per 10-minute period, as measured by an intrauterine pressure catheter). In a retrospective cohort, 33% went on to deliver vaginally and the rest delivered by cesarean, and mode of delivery carried different risks: cesarean delivery was associated with an increased risk of chorioamnionitis, endometritis, and postpartum hemorrhage, and vaginal delivery was associated with an increased risk for chorioamnionitis and shoulder dystocia. Prolonged first stage above the 90th percentile has been associated with increased maternal morbidities (P ≤ .02) and increased neonatal morbidities including respiratory distress syndrome, need for mechanical ventilation, and confirmed or suspected neonatal sepsis (P ≤ .03). Once a diagnosis of arrest of labor in the active phase has been made, cesarean delivery is indicated.

Clinical considerations — prediction of shoulder dystocia and risk factors: Although there are a number of known risk factors, shoulder dystocia cannot be accurately predicted or prevented, and clinicians should be aware of the risk factors for shoulder dystocia in order to anticipate those deliveries at high risk and should be prepared to address this complication in all deliveries. Increasing birth weight and maternal diabetes have been associated with an increased incidence, yet most cases occur in nondiabetic women with normal-sized infants; in one study of 221 shoulder dystocia births, more than one half of the infants weighed less than 4,000 g and 80% of women were not diabetic. Another study showed that maternal diabetes and fetal macrosomia accurately predicted only 55% of cases of shoulder dystocia, and other proposed risk factors (including excessive maternal weight or weight gain, operative vaginal delivery, oxytocin use, multiparity, epidural use, precipitous and prolonged second stage of labor alone or in combination) are poor predictors.

### Practice bulletin No 178: shoulder dystocia [^e9c117dd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Shoulder dystocia — labor abnormalities as predictors: Evidence across multiple studies indicates that common labor patterns do not reliably predict shoulder dystocia or neonatal injury; a large case–control series that "compared 276 consecutive cases of shoulder dystocia with 600 matched controls" found "labor patterns were not predictive of shoulder dystocia," a retrospective analysis of "52 cases of shoulder dystocia reported no difference in protracted dilation or mean duration of the second stage," and a case–control study of "80 cases" noted precipitous labor most common but "no difference in the rate of precipitous or prolonged labor in cases and controls." One small study "did find a significant association between active phase abnormality and shoulder dystocia; however, only 36 patients were included," and a U.S. multicenter study "with more than 100,000 women" found a prolonged second stage "was not associated with a statistically significant increase in the risk of shoulder dystocia." Clinicians "should have a heightened awareness for shoulder dystocia in these situations, although judicious use of operative vaginal delivery is reasonable even when risk factors are present."

### Practice bulletin No 178: shoulder dystocia [^92afb1b1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Shoulder dystocia — initial actions and maneuvers: Diagnosis usually occurs when there is failure of delivery of the fetal shoulder(s) after initial traction attempt(s), the time of diagnosis and completion of delivery should be noted, and additional nursing, obstetric care provider, and anesthesia assistance should be requested. The pregnant woman should be instructed not to push, the patient should be positioned so that the health care provider has adequate access, and if traction forces are applied, axial traction should be employed with a downward vector estimated to be 25–45 degrees below the horizontal plane when the laboring woman is in a lithotomy position. Laterally directed traction only should not be employed as the sole maneuver; among four cases managed only by lateral traction in one series, there were three brachial plexus injuries and one clavicular fracture. No randomized controlled trials have compared maneuvers, but when shoulder dystocia is suspected, the McRoberts maneuver should be attempted first, suprapubic pressure may be used at the same time to assist in dislodging the impacted shoulder, fundal pressure should be avoided, and if these are unsuccessful, delivery of the posterior arm can be considered and has a high degree of success in accomplishing delivery.

ACOG Committee Opinion on clinical guidelines and standardization of practice — Protocols and checklists should be recognized as guides to the management of a clinical situation or process of care that will apply to most patients. For any patient whose care cannot be managed by standardized protocols because of clinically valid reasons, the physician should document in the medical record why the protocol or checklist is not being followed. Obstetrician–gynecologists should be engaged in the process of developing guidelines and presenting data to help foster stakeholder buy-in and create consensus, thus improving adherence to guidelines and protocols.

### Shoulder dystocia [^2ffa61e4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The frequency of shoulder dystocia in different reports has varied, ranging 0.2–3% of all vaginal deliveries. Once a shoulder dystocia occurs, even if all actions are appropriately taken, there is an increased frequency of complications, including third- or fourth-degree perineal lacerations, postpartum hemorrhage, and neonatal brachial plexus palsies. Health care providers have a poor ability to predict shoulder dystocia for most patients and there remains no commonly accepted model to accurately predict this obstetric emergency. Consequently, optimal management of shoulder dystocia requires appropriate management at the time it occurs. Multiple investigators have attempted to enhance care of shoulder dystocia by utilizing protocols and simulation training.

Knowledge of the maneuvers used for the alleviation of shoulder dystocia is relevant not only for obstetric residents and attending house staff but also for family practitioners, nurses, and nurse midwives. The performance of shoulder dystocia "drills" can be helpful not only to coordinate a teamwork approach to this obstetric emergency but also to provide an opportunity to practice the maneuvers. Shoulder dystocia continues to represent an immense area of clinical interest because it typically occurs without prediction. All patients in labor should be considered at risk for the development of shoulder dystocia.

### First and second stage labor management: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 8 [^e3847734]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). High credibility.

Management of dystocia in the second stage — ACOG recommends pushing commence when complete cervical dilation is achieved (STRONG RECOMMENDATION, HIGH-QUALITY EVIDENCE). A meta-analysis of 12 trials comparing immediate with delayed pushing found that delayed pushing was associated with an increased rate of spontaneous vaginal delivery (61.5% vs 56.9%) (pooled RR 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03–1.15), whereas among only high-quality studies there was no difference (59.0% vs 54.9%) (pooled RR 1.07; 95% CI, 0.98–1.26). Delayed pushing was associated with prolongation of the second stage (weighted MD 56.92 minutes; 95% CI, 42.19–71.64) and shortened active pushing (weighted MD −21.98 minutes; 95% CI, −31.29 to −12.68). In a multicenter randomized controlled trial, delayed pushing produced an increased length of the second stage (31.8 minutes; 95% CI, 36.7–26.9; P < .001), and the study was stopped early due to increased postpartum hemorrhage, chorioamnionitis, and neonatal acidemia in the delayed pushing arm. Delayed pushing has not been studied among multiparous individuals or those without regional anesthesia; however, similar risks are anticipated, and, therefore, this approach should be avoided for these patients as well.

### Shoulder dystocia: simulation and a team-centered protocol [^c5104a07]. Seminars in Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

Shoulder dystocia is an obstetric emergency that has been reported to occur in 0.2–3% of all vaginal deliveries. Several characteristics of shoulder dystocia make it a particular challenge to manage effectively. It is relatively infrequent, the diagnosis cannot be made according to a single objective criterion that can be recognized to exist by all members of the care team who are present, it is unpredictable, and there is the need for coordinated actions of all members of the health care team who have come together on the day of the delivery and may not have worked together before or specifically during a shoulder dystocia. In general, there is evidence from different medical disciplines that checklists/protocols and simulation may be used to enhance team performance. There is also some evidence, albeit limited, that such techniques may be used to improve shoulder dystocia outcomes.

### A survey of central association members about the definition, management, and complications of shoulder dystocia [^14ef4062]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine practice patterns for shoulder dystocia and concepts dealing with brachial plexus palsy.

Methods

An Internet-based 25-question survey was electronically disseminated to all current members of the Central Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. For those individuals who did not respond, an additional opportunity to complete the assessment was provided during the 2009 annual meeting.

Results

Of 429 Central Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists members, 268 (62%) responded, with 192 (78%) filling out the survey online. Nearly 90% of those queried believed that shoulder dystocia was unpredictable and unpreventable. Thirty-seven percent felt that an elective cesarean delivery should be offered for an estimated fetal weight of 4,500 g among nondiabetics. Just 40% would have allowed a trial of labor with a documented history of shoulder dystocia. Slightly more than half answered that they never used either lateral or excessive traction and obstetrician-gynecologists were more likely than maternal-fetal medicine specialists to conclude that traction applied by the clinician doing the delivery was the cause of shoulder dystocia-related brachial plexus palsy (36% compared with 12%, P = 0.005). Maternal-fetal medicine specialists were more likely to believe that 40–50% of brachial plexus palsies occur without concomitant shoulder dystocia (21% compared with 9%, P = 0.015).

Conclusion

Differences in practice patterns exist among with regard to management recommendations of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Practice Bulletin on shoulder dystocia.

### Evaluation of multidisciplinary shoulder dystocia simulation training on knowledge, performance, and documentation [^4b53d0db]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Research has shown the utility of simulations involving individuals, yet little data exist on whether communication and documentation are impacted by the integration of all team members into a scenario. In 2018, the obstetrics department at this tertiary hospital began a multidisciplinary team-training simulation for shoulder dystocia. An educational portion was included, teaching a new practice where the provider announces delivery events (head, shoulder, body) to be marked on the delivery record, a standardized approach was introduced, and a pre- and post-simulation test was administered.

Objective

In this study, we sought to evaluate the lasting impact of this team-based tool on the outcomes and documentation of shoulder dystocia cases, specifically the recording of the exact shoulder dystocia duration in seconds. Secondary outcomes included evaluation of the documentation of shoulder dystocia maneuvers and a pre- and post-simulation knowledge test. Included in this test were questions from the validated survey, the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire, a tool focused on evaluating team dynamics and communication. It was hypothesized that this simulation would improve communication as shown by sustained improvement in documentation, competence in shoulder dystocia care, and confidence among members of the team as shown by improved scores on the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire.

Study Design

This was a retrospective cohort study of shoulder dystocia cases from 2017 and 2019 at a safety-net tertiary care hospital, 1 full year before and after the implementation of a multidisciplinary shoulder dystocia simulation in 2018. Delivery outcomes were compared, documentation of delivery event times was recorded and analyzed, and the delivery note was evaluated using the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines for shoulder dystocia. The surveys from participants were assessed for postsimulation improvement. Categorical variables were analyzed using chi-square tests and continuous variables were compared using Student t tests. Because shoulder dystocia duration is a nonparametric variable, this was compared using a Kruskal-Wallis test.

Results

There were 28 cases in the 2017 cohort and 25 in the 2019 cohort. In the 2017 cohort, 25% of delivery documentation (7 of 25) included the exact shoulder dystocia duration, which increased to 96% (24 of 25) in the 2019 cohort (P < .001). There was no significant impact on the shoulder dystocia duration (P = 0.163). On average, 2.7 maneuvers were required in the 2017 cohort, which increased to 3.4 maneuvers used in the 2019 cohort, showing a significant increase in the use of shoulder dystocia maneuvers (P = 0.030). The posttests showed no impact on shoulder dystocia background knowledge (P = 0.142) or knowledge of risk factors (P = 0.171) but did show an increased understanding of the definition and performance of shoulder dystocia maneuvers (P = 0.008). The Safety Attitudes Questionnaire revealed that simulation participants would feel safe being treated by their colleagues with a score of 4.7/5. On the paired responses after the simulation, nurses reported feeling that their input was more highly valued (P = 0.045), and participants of all disciplines felt they received adequate feedback on their performances (P = 0.041).

Conclusion

A multidisciplinary simulation on shoulder dystocia led to sustained improvement in documentation and shoulder dystocia maneuvers used, suggesting increased comfort with advanced maneuvers. Future studies should evaluate whether multidisciplinary simulations, mimicking the normal delivery team, may lead to other sustained improvements in maternal care.

Shoulder dystocia and postpartum hemorrhage represent two of the most common emergencies faced in obstetric clinical practice, both requiring prompt recognition and management to avoid significant morbidity or mortality. Shoulder dystocia is an uncommon, unpredictable, and unpreventable obstetric emergency and can be managed with appropriate intervention. Postpartum hemorrhage occurs more commonly and carries significant risk of maternal morbidity. Institutional protocols and algorithms for the prevention and management of shoulder dystocia and postpartum hemorrhage have become mainstays for clinicians. The goal of this review is to summarize the diagnosis, incidence, risk factors, and management of shoulder dystocia and postpartum hemorrhage.

'It depends on the client whether or not I would discuss a CS or induction of labour. If the shoulder dystocia was severe, I would not risk to experience that again'.
Domain II: The professional domain

Obstetricians and residents mentioned unclear documentation on previous deliveries, including advice on mode of birth in future pregnancies, as an important barrier for guideline adherence. Furthermore, they stated that incomplete counselling or unclear documentation of the decision making process for mode of birth in the current pregnancy, is an important factor for acting in line with the agreed mode of birth. For example:

You have planned a CS for a woman with a history of fetal macrosomia (4500 grams) and shoulder dystocia. If labour starts prematurely, you might advise her to undergo a vaginal birth, since the expected fetal weight is probably less than 4000 grams'.

Lack of experience regarding clinical skills in daily practice was also mentioned among all types of professionals to affect guideline adherence, mainly concerning vaginal breech deliveries, fetal scalp blood sampling and external cephalic version. A midwife adds:

'The mode of delivery in case of a breech presentation depends on the expertise of the obstetrician in attendance'.

One of the obstetricians describes:

'I believe that we perform a fetal scalp blood sampling about 5 times a year'… 'I think this is probably due to insufficient expertise among some of the obstetricians'.

Another barrier mentioned by the residents regarding the use of fetal scalp blood sampling is the large variation in policy between obstetricians as well as between hospitals. Some obstetricians favour a vacuum extraction when full dilatation of the cervix is reached, whereas others would perform fetal scalp blood sampling in order to, possibly, avoid an operational vaginal birth.

Obstetricians mentioned that the ability to evaluate a cardiotocogram during delivery on any computer as facilitator for optimal care. This improves communication between the obstetrician on call and the resident without the necessity to be present at the delivery ward.

Shoulder dystocia — brachial plexus injury is not proof of occurrence: The presence of a brachial plexus injury is not evidence that shoulder dystocia has occurred, and multiple reports indicate that not all brachial plexus injuries are related to shoulder dystocia and that the injury is multifactorial in nature. Cases of severe brachial plexus palsy have been documented in the absence of shoulder dystocia and without identifiable risk factors, and slightly more than one half of all brachial plexus injuries are associated with uncomplicated vaginal deliveries. Brachial plexus injury also has been found to occur in the posterior arm of infants whose anterior shoulder was impacted behind the symphysis pubis, as well as in vertex-presenting fetuses delivered by a traumatic cesarean.

### After shoulder dystocia: managing the subsequent pregnancy and delivery [^091ea753]. Seminars in Perinatology (2007). Low credibility.

Among risk factors for shoulder dystocia, a prior history of delivery complicated by shoulder dystocia is the single greatest risk factor for shoulder dystocia occurrence, with odds ratios 7 to 10 times that of the general population. Recurrence rates have been reported to be as high as 16%. Whereas prevention of shoulder dystocia in the general population is neither feasible nor cost-effective, intervention efforts directed at the particular subgroup of women with a prior history of shoulder dystocia can concentrate on potentially modifiable risk factors and individualized management strategies that can minimize recurrence and the associated significant morbidities and mortality.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 201: pregestational diabetes mellitus [^d9e05f7d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Delivery planning for pregestational diabetes — early delivery (36 0/7 weeks to 38 6/7 weeks of gestation, or even earlier) may be indicated in patients with vasculopathy, nephropathy, poor glucose control, or a prior stillbirth, whereas women with well-controlled diabetes with no other comorbidities may be managed expectantly to 39 0/7 weeks to 39 6/7 weeks of gestation as long as antenatal testing remains reassuring, and expectant management beyond 40 0/7 weeks of gestation generally is not recommended. Delivery of women with pregestational diabetes should occur at institutions with health care providers experienced in caring for such individuals, and during labor women with pregestational diabetes generally should undergo continuous intrapartum electronic fetal monitoring and typically are excluded from consideration for intermittent auscultation. For fetal size–based planning, prophylactic cesarean delivery may be considered if the estimated fetal weight is at least 4,500 g in women with diabetes. Women with diabetes have a higher risk of experiencing a shoulder dystocia than women without diabetes even when controlling for birth weight; clinicians should have heightened awareness, and judicious use of operative vaginal delivery is reasonable even in the presence of risk factors for shoulder dystocia.

### Assisted vaginal birth: green-top guideline no. 26 [^20621030]. BJOG (2020). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for assisted vaginal delivery, more specifically with respect to considerations for assisted vaginal delivery (forceps use), RCOG 2020 guidelines recommend to recognize the potential neonatal morbidity following a failed attempt at forceps delivery and inform the neonatologist when this occurs to ensure appropriate management of the infant.

### Is a' guideline-compliant' primary cesarean delivery associated with a modified risk for maternal and neonatal morbidity? a clinical evaluation of the 2014 ACOG / SMFM obstetric care consensus statement [^cebe93d1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Our final cohort included 827 women who delivered via primary CD during the study period. During the same period, 4938 women delivered without a history of prior CD, for a total institutional primary CD rate of 16.7%. Of our total primary CD cohort, 288 (34.8%) were determined to be guideline-compliant, 215 (26.0%) were guideline-noncompliant, and 324 (39.2%) were guideline-not addressed.

Baseline demographics of these three study groups are listed in Table 2. Statistically significant differences identified between the study groups include maternal parity, gestational age at delivery, labor status, and number of fetuses.

Table 2
Baseline demographics

Based on the 2014 Guidelines, indications for primary CD were divided into six categories (Table 1). During the study period, labor arrest (including failed induction and arrests of the first and second stages of labor) was the most common indication for primary CD, followed by (in order): non-reassuring fetal tracing; malpresentation; "other" (which included: prior myomectomy, placenta/vasa previa, cord prolapse, maternal infections [HIV with viral load > 1000 or active HSV], presumed fetal intolerance of labor, prior 3rd or 4th degree perineal laceration, prior shoulder dystocia, fetal anomaly, maternal request, maternal condition, or fetal condition); multiple gestations; and macrosomia.

### Practice bulletin No 178: shoulder dystocia [^cd45e45c]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Shoulder dystocia — role of simulation and team training: Obstetric simulation is an effective tool in preparing for shoulder dystocia because it is a high acuity/low frequency event. Studies have shown that simulation results in improved communication, use of obstetric maneuvers, and documentation of events. Evidence indicates that introduction of shoulder dystocia simulation and team training protocols at individual institutions may be associated with a reduction in transient brachial plexus injury when shoulder dystocia occurs. After the introduction of a mandatory clinical shoulder dystocia simulation for all personnel on a labor and delivery unit, the frequency of evidence-based management of shoulder dystocia was higher, and the rate of neonatal brachial injury at birth was lower. Moreover, a training protocol that included a didactic component followed by repeated simulations and debriefing resulted in a significant decrease in the frequency of brachial plexus palsy, from 10.1% before training to 4.0% during training to 2.6% after training (P = 0.03).

### Can shoulder dystocia be predicted before operative vaginal delivery using a score that includes ultrasonographic head-perineum distance measurement? [^7a70fdbc]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSIONS

Although SD remains difficult to predict, this scoring tool, which includes both maternal factors and US HPD measurement, facilitates assigning individual risk categories in OVD. This may improve the management of delivery mode, especially for high‐ and very high‐risk groups. External validation in other settings will be needed to confirm the discriminative ability of the score. Clinicians should exercise caution, as this point‐scoring system is not yet ready for clinical application until such validation takes place.

### What should be documented for an anterior shoulder dislocation? A Delphi study [^dea5e353]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Standardised consensus-based documentation following anterior shoulder dislocation in the ED might improve clinical quality, reduce heterogeneity in research and reduce workload. The aim of this study was to determine important elements and the extent of variability for the ED documentation following anterior shoulder dislocation.

Methods

An expert panel of physicians who perform the documentation (emergency physicians) of diagnosis and management of anterior shoulder dislocation and those who may read it (orthopaedic surgeons and general practitioners) was recruited in a three-round Delphi design between May and November 2022. Important elements were identified for history, physical examination, additional examinations, reduction technique and miscellaneous. These were rated on a 0–9 Likert scale. Consensus was reached when ≥ 80% scored 7–9. Another, independent, outcome was high variability in opinion, defined as at least one score between 1 and 3 and one score between 7 and 9 on an item after the third round.

Results

The expert panel consisted of 22 emergency physicians, 5 general practitioners and 3 orthopaedic surgeons. In the first round, 85 elements were identified, and consensus on importance was reached in 22 out of the 85 elements: medical history (5 out of 30), physical examination (5 out of 18), additional examinations (5 out of 9), reduction (5 out of 17) and miscellaneous (2 out of 11). High variability in importance was seen in 79 (93%) out of the 85 elements after the third round.

Conclusion

A consensus on 22 out of the 85 elements was reached and could be included in the ED documentation on anterior shoulder dislocation. Regardless of this consensus, high variability was observed in almost all the elements, highlighting the difference in opinions. Nevertheless, these elements could facilitate more concise communication among healthcare professionals and could facilitate homogenous datasets.

### Shoulder dystocia [^8e1717c3]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Shoulder dystocia can be one of the most frightening emergencies in the delivery room. Although many factors have been associated with shoulder dystocia, most cases occur with no warning. Calm and effective management of this emergency is possible with recognition of the impaction and institution of specified maneuvers, such as the McRoberts maneuver, suprapubic pressure, internal rotation, or removal of the posterior arm, to relieve the impacted shoulder and allow for spontaneous delivery of the infant. The "HELPERR" mnemonic from the Advanced Life Support in Obstetrics course can be a useful tool for addressing this emergency. Although no ideal manipulation or treatment exists, all maneuvers in the HELPERR mnemonic aid physicians in completing one of three actions: enlarging the maternal pelvis through cephalad rotation of the symphysis and flattening of the sacrum; collapsing the fetal shoulder width; or altering the orientation of the longitudinal axis of the fetus to the plane of the obstruction. In rare cases in which these interventions are unsuccessful, additional management options, such as intentional clavicle fracture, symphysiotomy, and the Zavanelli maneuver, are described.

### Practice bulletin No 178: shoulder dystocia [^ac2acc52]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Shoulder dystocia — prophylactic cesarean for suspected macrosomia: Incorporating ultrasound detection of macrosomia (4,500 g or greater), it was calculated that 3,695 cesarean deliveries would be required to prevent one permanent injury, at an additional cost of $8.7 million for each permanent injury avoided; in maternal diabetes, figures were 443 cesarean deliveries and $930,000 per permanent injury avoided. Because of the lack of well-designed and well-executed randomized clinical trials, a policy for suspected fetal macrosomia of less than 5,000 g would be economically unsound for pregnancies in the absence of maternal diabetes. Elective cesarean delivery should be considered for women without diabetes with an estimated fetal weight of at least 5,000 g and for women with diabetes whose fetuses are estimated to weigh at least 4,500 g.

### Improvement in documentation using an electronic checklist for shoulder dystocia deliveries [^e13056d6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate if using an electronic checklist improved the documentation of shoulder dystocias that occurred at our institution.

Methods

A standard checklist of key elements that should be included in the delivery note after a shoulder dystocia was added to the electronic delivery note at our institution. We identified shoulder dystocia deliveries from the department's delivery database for 3 years before and after the checklist was included and compared delivery notes written from these time periods with respect to their content.

Results

Forty-six shoulder dystocia deliveries were identified before the checklist being available and 82 after. There was a significant increase noted in the frequency with which several elements were documented after the checklist was implemented including McRoberts maneuver (before checklist 69%, compared with after checklist 90%, P = 0.003), head-to-body interval (22% compared with 84%, P < .001), which shoulder was anterior (48% compared with 96%, P < .001), and if the neonate was moving its arms after delivery (50% compared with 93%, P < .001).

Conclusion

Use of a standard checklist for shoulder dystocia in the delivery note resulted in a significant improvement in the documentation of several critical elements.

### Operative vaginal birth: ACOG practice bulletin, number 219 [^fd2bfcd7]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Operative vaginal birth with fetal macrosomia — comparative data show that among 2,924 infants, those with birth weights greater than 4,000 g versus 3,000 g to 3,999 g had an overall injury rate of 1.6% compared with 0.4%, and forceps delivery in the greater than 4,000 g group produced a 7.3-fold increase in persistent injury at 6 months (95% CI, 6.5–8.2), while the risk of persistent injury was not different from the increased risk with spontaneous vaginal birth at greater than 4,000 g (RR, 7.7; 95% CI, 7.4–8.1); preventing a single persistent injury would require as many as 258 elective cesarean deliveries. There are no studies that evaluate the risk of complications with operative vaginal birth based on estimated fetal weight, and judicious use for suspected macrosomia is not contraindicated; considerations include adequacy of the maternal pelvis and progress of labor, and caution should be used with preparations for an increased possibility of shoulder dystocia.

### Clinical guidelines-the challenges and opportunities: what we have learned from the case of misoprostol for postpartum hemorrhage [^aefbce08]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2019). Medium credibility.

The survey showed that while many MAs reported using WHO and/or FIGO guidelines as key referral documents, only approximately half then recommended the same regimen. While adaptations of international guidelines are acknowledged to be needed to make them locally appropriate and better able to meet the specific needs of each country and health service, WHO notes that: "Modifications to the recommendations, where necessary, should be limited to weak recommendations and justifications for any changes made in an explicit and transparent manner." 6 Given that modifications have been made to strong recommendations (i.e. those based on high‐quality evidence), and alternatives recommended are based on limited data and may be pharmacokinetically inferior, 17 further work is needed to examine how international guidelines are used and what additional information determines the regimen that is selected nationally.

Differences between recommendations in international and regional guidelines may create an additional challenge for countries looking for external guidance when developing their own national protocols/guidelines. Additionally, it is interesting to note that some countries or regions tend to place closer attention and allegiance to specific external recommendations than others. For example, anecdotal evidence suggests MAs in Latin America look to FLASOG for guidance and many MAs in Africa look to the RCOG for guidance. This can be problematic as the RCOG guidelines do not look at African countries when formulating their recommendations, but to their own members — obstetricians and gynecologists in the UK. Therefore, low‐resource countries that are heavily reliant on guidelines from high‐resource countries may not be making the best recommendations for their particular country. They may instead focus on reinforcing higher technologies that may not be the most feasible or sustainable in lower‐resource settings. The RCOG and other high‐resource country guidelines may not need to include misoprostol at all owing to the common usage of oxytocin and the absence of barriers that would mean referencing alternatives. Obviously, the resource setting should determine the recommendation, which is why WHO suggests countries adapt international guidelines to their specific context. When we notified the RCOG of the high proportion of MAs using RCOG guidelines, we received the following response: "In their 2016 updated guidelines, RCOG removed misoprostol for prophylaxis as evidence suggested it was no better, and possibly not quite as good as, the current well‐established prophylaxis with syntocinon. The RCOG accepts, however, that misoprostol has an important role to play in settings where oxytocin is not readily available."

### Shoulder dystocia: managing an obstetric emergency [^38314f14]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Shoulder dystocia is an obstetric emergency in which normal traction on the fetal head does not lead to delivery of the shoulders. This can cause neonatal brachial plexus injuries, hypoxia, and maternal trauma, including damage to the bladder, anal sphincter, and rectum, and postpartum hemorrhage. Although fetal macrosomia, prior shoulder dystocia, and preexisting or gestational diabetes mellitus increases the risk of shoulder dystocia, most cases occur without warning. Labor and delivery teams should always be prepared to recognize and treat this emergency. Training and simulation exercises improve physician and team performance when shoulder dystocia occurs. Unequivocally announcing that dystocia is happening, summoning extra assistance, keeping track of the time from delivery of the head to full delivery of the neonate, and communicating with the patient and health care team are helpful. Calm and thoughtful use of release maneuvers such as knee to chest (McRoberts maneuver), suprapubic pressure, posterior arm or shoulder delivery, and internal rotational maneuvers will almost always result in successful delivery. When these are unsuccessful, additional maneuvers, including intentional clavicular fracture or cephalic replacement, may lead to delivery. Each institution should consider the length of time it will take to prepare the operating room for general inhalational anesthesia and abdominal rescue and practice this during simulation exercises.

### THISTLE: trial of hands-on interprofessional simulation training for local emergencies: a research protocol for a stepped-wedge clustered randomised controlled trial [^e42b654f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

The local in-house PROMPT course is a one-day, simple, adaptable multi-professional training course that covers the management of obstetric emergencies such as eclampsia, post-partum haemorrhage, maternal collapse, sepsis and shoulder dystocia. In-house training includes a variety of teaching methods including lectures, video demonstrations, and multi-professional rehearsals of simulated obstetric emergencies, using simple tools and algorithms to make it easier to implement the correct treatment. All staff should be trained annually.

Standard care

Standard care is expected during the control period for all Maternity Units (step 0) and also the intervention periods for Units not allocated to steps 1 and 2. All Units will be considered to have stopped standard care at the start of step 4 (last intervention period).

Follow-up

Maternity Units will all be monitored for at least 12 months from the end of their intervention period, until the end of the last follow-up period (step 5). All mothers and children will receive clinical follow-up as part of their standard care, but we do not intend to continue any follow-up beyond birth for the purposes of this study.

Safety

The intervention being evaluated is available to NHS and international maternity staff. With the assistance of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), the PROMPT 'Course in a Box' was first published in 2008 (PROMPT 'Course in a Box' 2nd Edition published in 2012), and has no known safety concerns.

Outcome measure

Primary outcome measure

The primary outcome measure is the proportion of infants born with a low Apgar score (score < 7 vs. ≥ 7) at 5 min for all vaginal or emergency CS term livebirths (≥ 37 weeks). The Apgar score is routinely assigned for all births and collected at Unit level with later collation at national level. The primary outcome will not be derived for babies born at home or at other hospitals before being transferred to one of the participating Units, preterm infants and elective Caesarean Section (CS) births. Intra-uterine deaths diagnosed prior to labour will also be excluded from the analyses.

Secondary outcome measure

None

Process measures

Descriptive data from the Units will be collated:
Total number of live births per period
Total number of staff in the Unit – separated into staff groups
Total number of staff trained – separated into staff groups
Process measures: % of staff trained and time to train local staff

### Reducing obstetric litigation through alterations in practice patterns [^49d29e85]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the extent to which obstetric malpractice claims might be reduced by adherence to a limited number of specific practice patterns.

Methods

We examined all 189 closed perinatal claims between 2000 and 2005 from a single, large, professional liability insurer. Each case was subjected to three separate analyses: 1) whether the adverse outcome was caused by substandard care, 2) what changes in practice likely would have avoided the adverse outcome, regardless of standard-of-care considerations, and 3) to what extent did substandard documentation lead to payment in cases in which there was no objective evidence of substandard care.

Results

Seventy percent of claims involving obstetric practice (accounting for 79% of all costs) involved substandard care. Payments in 85% of cases involving non-vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) fetal monitoring, 16% of maternal injury cases, 80% of cases involving VBAC, and 54% of shoulder dystocia cases were avoidable had four specific practice and documentation patterns been followed.

Conclusion

Most money currently paid in conjunction with obstetric malpractice cases is a result of actual substandard care resulting in preventable injury. Well more than half of hospital litigation costs might be avoided if physician practice included: 1) delivery in a facility with 24-hour in-house obstetric coverage; 2) adherence to published high-risk medication protocols; 3) a more conservative approach to VBAC; and 4) use of a comprehensive, standardized procedure note in cases of shoulder dystocia.

### Evaluation of the quality of guidelines for the management of reduced fetal movements in UK maternity units [^9aa06cf0]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Results

Quantitative evaluation of guidelines

Of the 235 units contacted, a response was received from 98 (42%). Of those respondents, 12 (12%) did not have a guideline. Seven (8%) of the 86 guidelines received were out of date and 10 (12%) had no review date. No guideline contained all 12 key recommendations from the RCOG Guideline, the median number of recommendations included in unit guidelines was 7 (Range 3–11; Table 1). The only criterion included in all the guidelines was 'after fetal viability has been confirmed and history confirms a decrease in fetal movements, arrangements should be made for the woman to have a cardiotocograph (CTG) to exclude fetal compromise'. Eleven units continue to recommend the use of kick-charts despite national guidance to the contrary. Further detailed investigation of women presenting with RFM was recommended in up to 30% of guidelines, which increased to 53% for women with multiple presentations with RFM. There was no relationship between the strength of evidence for the recommendation and inclusion in unit guidelines.

### Practice bulletin No 178: shoulder dystocia [^36dafd63]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Gestational diabetes and suspected large-for-gestational-age fetuses — observational evidence on induction policies shows mixed effects on shoulder dystocia and cesarean delivery. In insulin-treated gestational diabetes, there were no significant differences in macrosomia or cesarean delivery between induction at 38–39 weeks and expectant management, but shoulder dystocia occurred in 10% beyond 40 weeks versus 1.4% with induction at 38–39 weeks. In a prospective study of 1,337 women with gestational or pregestational diabetes versus 1,227 historic controls using ultrasonography at 37–38 weeks to guide delivery, women with estimated fetal weight classified as large for gestational age but less than 4,250 grams underwent induction, whereas greater than 4,250 grams led to cesarean delivery. After implementation, shoulder dystocia incidence decreased from 2.8% to 1.5% (OR, 1.9; 95% CI; 1.0–3.5) while cesarean delivery increased from 21.7% to 25.1% (P < .04), and nearly one half (47%) of scheduled cesareans for estimates of at least 4,250 g delivered infants with birth weight less than 4,000 g; birth trauma was not eliminated (two versus one brachial plexus injury and 10 versus six fractures). These authors suggest that ultrasonography for estimated fetal weight may be a useful adjunct in timing delivery for women with diabetes, but the study's nonrandomized design, historic controls, multiple interventions, small sample size, and a systematic review concluding insufficient evidence limit decision making.

### Practice bulletin No 178: shoulder dystocia [^504be945]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Neonatal complications — In a large multicenter study of 2,018 cases of shoulder dystocia there were 60 cases of Erb palsy, 4 cases of Klumpke palsy, 41 cases of clavicular or humeral fractures, and 6 cases of hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy, for a total neonatal injury rate of 5.2%. Transient brachial plexus injuries vary by series, with most reporting a 10–20% injury rate immediately after the delivery. Reported recovery is heterogeneous: some authors note complete recovery rates of 80% whereas others report less than 50%, and 64% of infants with C5–C6 or C5–C6–C7 injuries had complete recovery at 6 months compared with 14% of C5–T1 injuries. Severe outcomes are uncommon; among 6,238 cases in neonates who weighed more than 3,500 grams, severe asphyxia occurred in 1% of infants of diabetic women and 0.08% of infants of non-diabetic women. In another multicenter series of 2,018 cases, the six cases of hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy were associated with the use of more than five maneuvers, and the mean time from head to body delivery was 10.75 minutes (range 3–20 minutes).

### A critical evaluation of the external and internal maneuvers for resolution of shoulder dystocia [^f8ef10b8]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

In the management of shoulder dystocia, it is often recommended to start with external maneuvers, such as the McRoberts maneuver and suprapubic pressure, followed by internal maneuvers including rotation and posterior arm delivery. However, this sequence is not based on scientific evidence of its success rates, the technical simplicity, or the related complication rates. Hence, this review critically evaluates the success rate, technique, and safety of different maneuvers. Retrospective reviews showed that posterior arm delivery has consistently higher success rates (86.1%) than rotational methods (62.4%) and external maneuvers (56.0%). McRoberts maneuver was thought to be a simple method, however, its mechanism is not clear. Furthermore, McRoberts position still requires subsequent traction on the fetal neck, which presents a risk for brachial plexus injury. The 2 internal maneuvers have anatomic rationales with the aim of rotating the shoulders to the wider oblique pelvic dimension or reducing the shoulder width. The techniques are not more sophisticated and requires the accoucher to insert the correct hand (according to fetal face direction) through the more spacious sacro-posterior region and deep enough to reach the fetal chest or posterior forearm. The performance of rotation and posterior arm delivery can also be integrated and performed using the same hand. Retrospective studies may give a biased view that the internal maneuvers are riskier. First, a less severely impacted shoulder dystocia is more likely to have been managed by external maneuvers, subjecting more difficult cases to internal maneuvers. Second, neonatal injuries were not necessarily caused by the internal maneuvers that led to delivery but could have been caused by the preceding unsuccessful external maneuvers. The procedural safety is not primarily related to the nature of the maneuvers, but to how properly these maneuvers are performed. When all these maneuvers have failed, it is important to consider the reasons for failure otherwise repetition of the maneuver cycle is just a random trial and error. If the posterior axilla is just above the pelvic outlet and reachable, posterior axilla traction using either the accoucher fingers or a sling is a feasible alternative. Its mechanism is not just outward traction but also rotation of the shoulders to the wider oblique pelvic dimension. If the posterior axilla is at a higher sacral level, a sling may be formed with the assistance of a long right-angle forceps, otherwise, more invasive methods such as Zavanelli maneuver, abdominal rescue, or symphysiotomy are the last resorts.
