## Question

What are the specific patient populations in which Augmentin is preferred over Cipro and Flagyl in diverticulitis treatment?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which specific patient populations should preferentially receive Augmentin (amoxicillin–clavulanate) rather than ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole (Cipro + Flagyl) for diverticulitis treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether antibiotics are even indicated. Then, I should verify the comparative effectiveness and safety of Augmentin versus Cipro + Flagyl. Next, I will identify patient-level factors that shift the balance toward Augmentin, including safety, comorbidities, and stewardship. After that, I should consider special populations and when to avoid Augmentin. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and note any caveats about resistance and local epidemiology.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context, because I need to ensure we are not overgeneralizing antibiotic use. Modern guidelines emphasize that many patients with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis do not require antibiotics at all, so the question of "which antibiotic" applies only when antibiotics are actually indicated, such as in complicated disease, systemic symptoms, immunocompromise, frailty, or selected cases of uncomplicated disease with concerning features or patient preference [^1921cced] [^ef59fb0a] [^ea3cb0b5].

> Next, I should review comparative effectiveness and safety. Wait, let me verify the head-to-head data. Large nationwide cohort studies show no difference in diverticulitis-specific outcomes between amoxicillin–clavulanate and metronidazole plus a fluoroquinolone, but amoxicillin–clavulanate is associated with a lower 1-year risk of Clostridioides difficile infection, which is a meaningful safety advantage in routine outpatient care [^9f0b81d1]. I should also confirm that guidelines list amoxicillin–clavulanate as an accepted outpatient option alongside fluoroquinolone-based regimens, reinforcing that both are reasonable when antibiotics are indicated [^f627c32c].

> Now, I will examine patient-level factors that favor Augmentin. Hold on, I should verify the key differentiators. Patients with elevated C. difficile risk, older adults, those with multiple comorbidities, or anyone prioritizing minimizing adverse events are reasonable candidates to prefer Augmentin given the lower CDI risk signal and the simplicity of monotherapy, which also reduces pill burden and potential drug–drug interactions compared with dual therapy [^9f0b81d1]. Let me consider stewardship as well: choosing narrower-spectrum monotherapy when clinically appropriate aligns with antimicrobial stewardship principles and may mitigate resistance selection pressures, although I need to ensure local resistance patterns still support amoxicillin–clavulanate efficacy [^f627c32c].

> But wait, what if the patient is in a special population where Augmentin is less attractive or contraindicated. I should double-check renal dosing and hepatic cautions. In significant renal impairment, Augmentin requires dose adjustment and the XR formulation should be avoided in eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m², which can complicate outpatient use; in these cases, ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole may be more practical if antibiotics are needed, assuming no contraindications and appropriate renal dosing for ciprofloxacin [^56f1c59f] [^4e451446] [^b2f54d9c]. I also need to check for beta-lactam allergy; in true immediate hypersensitivity, Augmentin is contraindicated and a fluoroquinolone-based regimen is appropriate, whereas in non-anaphylactic histories, careful selection of alternatives may still be reasonable depending on severity and prior reactions [^5a3ef84e].

> Let me synthesize the specific populations where Augmentin is preferred. I should confirm that these are grounded in evidence and guidelines. Prefer Augmentin when antibiotics are indicated in immunocompetent outpatients with uncomplicated or mildly complicated disease who have no beta-lactam allergy, normal or mildly reduced renal function, and no hepatic contraindications, particularly when C. difficile risk is a concern or when simplifying to monotherapy is desirable; this aligns with comparative effectiveness data and guideline-endorsed outpatient options [^9f0b81d1] [^f627c32c]. Also consider Augmentin in older adults with comorbidities or frailty when antibiotics are indicated, balancing renal function and monitoring needs, given the potential to reduce CDI and streamline therapy [^d66821be] [^9f0b81d1].

> Hold on, I should verify the caveats so I do not overstate universality. Local antibiograms matter; if local Enterobacteriaceae resistance to amoxicillin–clavulanate exceeds about 20%, empiric use may be inappropriate and a different regimen should be chosen per stewardship guidance, which tempers blanket preference for Augmentin in some communities [^c9d46117]. I also need to remember that many patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis do not need antibiotics at all, so the default should be selective use rather than routine antibiotics, reserving regimen choice for those who truly merit therapy [^1921cced] [^ef59fb0a].

> In summary, after checking the evidence and guidelines, Augmentin is preferred over Cipro + Flagyl in immunocompetent outpatients with uncomplicated or mildly complicated diverticulitis who require antibiotics, have no beta-lactam allergy, adequate renal function, and no hepatic contraindications, especially when C. difficile risk is a priority or when monotherapy simplifies care; conversely, consider alternatives in significant renal impairment, beta-lactam allergy, or settings with high local resistance to amoxicillin–clavulanate, and always individualize based on comorbidities and patient preferences [^9f0b81d1] [^f627c32c] [^c9d46117].

---

Augmentin (amoxicillin-clavulanate) is preferred over ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole (Cipro/Flagyl) for **uncomplicated diverticulitis in immunocompetent outpatients** [^f627c32c] because it provides equivalent clinical outcomes [^9f0b81d1] with a lower risk of C. difficile infection and fewer adverse effects. It is also preferred for patients with **beta-lactam allergy** (non-anaphylactic) [^notfound], those at **higher risk of C. difficile** [^9f0b81d1], or when **fluoroquinolone resistance is high locally** [^c1e291c3]. Augmentin is not appropriate for patients with severe beta-lactam allergy, severe renal impairment, or when local resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanate exceeds 20% [^c9d46117].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting Augmentin

Recent studies and guidelines show that Augmentin is **effective and safe** for uncomplicated diverticulitis:

- **Equivalent clinical outcomes**: Augmentin achieves similar rates of hospitalization, urgent surgery, and recurrence compared with ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole in immunocompetent outpatients [^9f0b81d1].

- **Lower risk of C. difficile infection**: Augmentin is associated with a significantly lower risk of C. difficile infection than fluoroquinolone-based regimens [^9f0b81d1].

- **Fewer adverse effects**: Augmentin has fewer adverse effects, including gastrointestinal disturbances and neurological side effects, compared with ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole [^notfound].

---

## Patient populations where Augmentin is preferred

Based on current evidence and guidelines, **Augmentin is preferred** over ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole in the following patient populations:

| **Patient population** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Immunocompetent outpatients with uncomplicated diverticulitis | - Equivalent clinical outcomes [^9f0b81d1] <br/> - Lower risk of C. difficile infection [^9f0b81d1] <br/> - Fewer adverse effects [^notfound] |
| Patients with non-anaphylactic beta-lactam allergy | - Safe alternative to fluoroquinolones <br/> - Avoids risks associated with fluoroquinolones [^notfound] |
| Patients at higher risk of C. difficile infection (e.g. elderly, recent antibiotic use, proton pump inhibitor use) | Lower risk of C. difficile infection compared with fluoroquinolones [^9f0b81d1] |
| Patients with contraindications to fluoroquinolones (e.g. QT prolongation, tendon disorders, myasthenia gravis) | Avoids adverse effects associated with fluoroquinolones [^notfound] |
| Patients in settings with high fluoroquinolone resistance | - Effective alternative <br/> - Addresses resistance concerns [^c1e291c3] |

---

## Patient populations where ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole may still be preferred

Despite the advantages of Augmentin, **ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole** may still be preferred in certain scenarios:

- **Severe beta-lactam allergy**: Patients with anaphylactic reactions to beta-lactams should avoid Augmentin.

- **Severe renal impairment**: Augmentin requires dose adjustment and may not be suitable in severe renal impairment [^56f1c59f] [^cefcd90a].

- **High local resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanate**: If local resistance rates exceed 20%, alternative regimens may be preferred [^c9d46117].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines from the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) and the American College of Physicians (ACP) support the **selective use of antibiotics** in uncomplicated diverticulitis, with Augmentin listed as an appropriate option when antibiotics are indicated [^f627c32c] [^ad42f70a]. The AGA specifically recommends antibiotics for patients with comorbidities, frailty, refractory symptoms, or elevated inflammatory markers, and Augmentin is a reasonable choice in these settings [^ea3cb0b5].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Augmentin is preferred over ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole for **uncomplicated diverticulitis in immunocompetent outpatients**, patients with non-anaphylactic beta-lactam allergy, those at higher risk of C. difficile infection, and in settings with high fluoroquinolone resistance. Ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole remains an option for patients with severe beta-lactam allergy, severe renal impairment, or when local resistance to Augmentin is high. Clinicians should individualize antibiotic selection based on patient-specific factors, local resistance patterns, and guideline recommendations.

### Progress and challenges in the management of diverticular disease: which treatment? [^c0045bbe]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Another innovative therapeutic approach is being suggested and recommended in several studies worldwide to reduce the use of antibiotics in the clinical management of these uncomplicated cases. Antibiotic treatment should be used in selected cases such as patients with signs of generalized infection, immunosuppressed patients, or conservative nonantibiotic treatment failure. Two systematic reviews have called antibiotic usage into question. The first systematic review identified three RCTs and reported that antibiotic use did not reduce the duration of symptoms or prevent subsequent complications or recurrence. However, we note that the quality of evidence from the included trials was low because of a high risk of bias, and only patients with modified Hinchey stage Ia and Ib were included, thus excluding immunocompromised patients, those with symptoms of sepsis, or significant comorbidity. Data from a RCT by Chabok and colleagues found that antibiotics may reduce complication risk during treatment [relative risk (RR) 0.49; 95% CI 0.12–1.95], but with no statistical significance. A recent systematic review including eight studies with over 2400 patients found no difference in complication rates between patients taking antibiotics and nonantibiotic usage, with only increasing length of hospital stay without antibiotics. Also, a recent multicenter RCT of systemic antibiotic treatment (1.2 g of amoxicillin clavulanic acid/6 h intravenously for a minimum of 48 h and then switched to oral administration of 625 mg/8 h) versus observation with no antibiotics for a first episode of uncomplicated AD showed that the observational arm was not associated with poorer outcomes.

Recommended antibiotic regimens include ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole, penicillin derivatives such as ampicillin or piperacillin/tazobactam, and third-generation cephalosporin to cover gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria. Data do not support intravenous antibiotic treatment over oral treatment, and duration of treatment from 4 days to over 7 days does not seem to have any advantage related to clinical outcomes. It should be emphasized, however, that the choice of antimicrobials is entirely empiric, since no trial has compared the efficacy of the different regimens mentioned above.

### Comparative effectiveness and harms of antibiotics for outpatient diverticulitis: two nationwide cohort studies [^9f0b81d1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Outpatient diverticulitis is commonly treated with either a combination of metronidazole and a fluoroquinolone (metronidazole-with-fluoroquinolone) or amoxicillin-clavulanate alone. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration advised that fluoroquinolones be reserved for conditions with no alternative treatment options. The comparative effectiveness of metronidazole-with-fluoroquinolone versus amoxicillin-clavulanate for diverticulitis is uncertain.

Objective

To determine the effectiveness and harms of metronidazole-with-fluoroquinolone versus amoxicillin-clavulanate for outpatient diverticulitis.

Design

Active-comparator, new-user, retrospective cohort studies.

Setting

Nationwide population-based claims data on U.S. residents aged 18 to 64 years with private employer-sponsored insurance (2000 to 2018) or those aged 65 years or older with Medicare (2006 to 2015).

Participants

Immunocompetent adults with diverticulitis in the outpatient setting.

Intervention

Metronidazole-with-fluoroquinolone or amoxicillin-clavulanate.

Measurements

1-year risks for inpatient admission, urgent surgery, and Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) and 3-year risk for elective surgery.

Results

In MarketScan (IBM Watson Health), new users of metronidazole-with-fluoroquinolone (n = 106 361) and amoxicillin-clavulanate (n = 13 160) were identified. There were no differences in 1-year admission risk (risk difference, 0.1 percentage points [95% CI, -0.3 to 0.6]), 1-year urgent surgery risk (risk difference, 0.0 percentage points [CI, -0.1 to 0.1]), 3-year elective surgery risk (risk difference, 0.2 percentage points [CI, -0.3 to 0.7]), or 1-year CDI risk (risk difference, 0.0 percentage points [CI, -0.1 to 0.1]) between groups. In Medicare, new users of metronidazole-with-fluoroquinolone (n = 17 639) and amoxicillin-clavulanate (n = 2709) were identified. There were no differences in 1-year admission risk (risk difference, 0.1 percentage points [CI, -0.7 to 0.9]), 1-year urgent surgery risk (risk difference, -0.2 percentage points [CI, -0.6 to 0.1]), or 3-year elective surgery risk (risk difference, -0.3 percentage points [CI, -1.1 to 0.4]) between groups. The 1-year CDI risk was higher for metronidazole-with-fluoroquinolone than for amoxicillin-clavulanate (risk difference, 0.6 percentage points [CI, 0.2 to 1.0]).

Limitation

Residual confounding is possible, and not all harms associated with these antibiotics, most notably drug-induced liver injury, could be assessed.

Conclusion

Treating diverticulitis in the outpatient setting with amoxicillin-clavulanate may reduce the risk for fluoroquinolone-related harms without adversely affecting diverticulitis-specific outcomes.

### Outcome variation in the use and duration of antibiotic therapy in patients presenting with acute diverticulitis [^a040aa81]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic duration

Of the 84.7% (n = 62,499) of individuals in the cohort who filled a prescription within three days of ED index visit, 62.4% (n = 38,999) were for a duration of ten days, while 27.5% (n = 17,179) were for seven days (Fig. 1). The most common prescription was for ciprofloxacin and metronidazole (54.8%) followed by amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (23.0%) (Table 3).

Fig. 1
Duration of antibiotic prescriptions

Table 3
Most common antibiotic prescriptions

Unadjusted comparisons of outcomes by antibiotic durations revealed significant differences (Fig. 2). Those receiving antibiotic courses of 11 + days experienced the highest rates of surgery (3.2%, vs. 1.4% for 7-days and 1.6% for no antibiotics, p < 0.001). Again, those who had 11 + day prescription durations had the highest rates of diverticulitis-related ED visits, while those with no initial prescription or only 7 days prescription had lower rates of this outcome (6.4% vs. 4.9% and 5.5%, respectively, p < 0.001). Additional antibiotic prescriptions were again different between groups, with the lowest rates observed with no antibiotic use (24.1%, p < 0.001 between all groups). No differences between groups were identified regarding need for percutaneous drainage within 90 days of index ED visit. (Fig. 2).

### Paradigm shift: the copernican revolution in diverticular disease [^a4da3465]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute uncomplicated diverticulitis (AUD)

The management of patients with AUD has undergone several modifications in terms of hospital admission, antibiotic administration and surgical intervention. A recent systematic review found that selected patients with the mild form of AUD, without relevant comorbidities or risk factors for complications, might be safely managed without hospital admission, with an average cost saving that ranged from 42–82% compared to inpatient treatment. Some recent studies highlighted that some AUD patients may be treated with conservative therapy without antibiotics. The American Gastroenterological Association's guidelines suggest that antibiotics should be used selectively, case by case, rather than routinely as in the past, but the grade of recommendation was conditional and the quality of evidence low. A recent meta-analysis of 8 studies found no difference in treatment outcome, readmission rate, diverticulitis complications, or need for elective or emergent surgery between AUD patients treated with or without antibiotics. However, only 2 randomized studies, both from Scandinavia, were included, whilst all the others were retrospective, non-randomized studies. Therefore, the data should be interpreted with caution, since at entry the enrolled patients were not comparable in terms of several clinical characteristics, based on which the choice of treatment (antibiotic or conservative) was arbitrarily applied by the clinician. Data from ongoing randomized controlled trials are awaited. When antibiotic therapy is deemed necessary, some concerns may arise about both therapy duration and route of administration. It has been found that a 5-day course of antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone and metronidazole i.v. is equally effective to a 5–10 day course. Moreover, some studies have challenged the traditional concept of treating acute diverticulitis with intravenous antibiotic therapy, instead proposing that oral antibiotic therapy may be appropriate. A randomized controlled trial found no difference in the outcome of AUD patients treated with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole administered orally or i.v.

Introduction

Diverticulitis is a common reason for presentation to the Emergency Department (ED). However, as imaging options, risk stratification tools, and antibiotic options have expanded, there is a need for current data on the changes in incidence, computed tomography (CT) performance, antibiotic usage, and disposition over time.

Methods

This was a cross-sectional study of ED patients with a diagnosis of diverticulitis from 1/1/2016 to 12/31/2023. Using the Epic Cosmos database, all ED visits for acute diverticulitis were identified using ICD-10 codes. Outcomes included total ED presentations for diverticulitis, admission rates, CTs performed, outpatient antibiotic prescriptions, and antibiotics administered in the ED for admitted patients.

Results

There were 186,138,130 total ED encounters, with diverticulitis representing 927,326 (0.50%). The rate of diverticulitis diagnosis increased from 0.40% to 0.56% over time. The admission rate declined over time from 33.6% to 27.7%, while the CT rate rose from 83.0% to 92.6%. Among those discharged, 90.4% received an antibiotic, which remained consistent over time. Metronidazole (55.1%) and ciprofloxacin (40.8%) were the most commonly prescribed antibiotics, followed by amoxicillin-clavulanate (36.1%). Among those admitted, most received either metronidazole (62.0%), a fluoroquinolone (40.4%), a third-generation cephalosporin (18.9%), or a penicillin-based agent (38.1%). Among both discharged and admitted patients, there was a marked shift to penicillin-based agents as the primary antibiotic regimen.

Conclusion

Diverticulitis remains a common ED presentation, with a gradually rising incidence over time. Admission rates have decreased, while CT imaging has become more common. Most patients receive antibiotics, though the specific antibiotic has shifted in favor of penicillin-based agents. These findings can provide key benchmarking data and inform future initiatives to guide imaging and antibiotic use.

Table 4.
Mesalazine for treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease and primary prevention of diverticulitis: results from a systematic review of randomized-controlled trials (data from Picchio et al.).

The apparent colonic hypermotility in diverticular disease, suggests that antispasmodic agents might improve abdominal pain, by decreasing muscular contraction. No randomized clinical trials are, however, available to confirm this benefit.

In acute uncomplicated diverticulitis (Hinchey, stage 0 or Ia), an outpatient management is now considered the optimal approach for most patients. Oral antimicrobials are often prescribed, but recent studies found no support to the routine use of antibiotics. A recent meta-analysisactually found that antibiotic use increases the length of hospital stay but is not associated with a reduction in overall or individual complication rates. The combination of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole is probably the most prescribed oral treatment. Admission to hospital and intravenous antibiotics are only recommended when the patient cannot tolerate oral feeding, is affected by severe comorbidities or does not improve with outpatient treatment. Most diverticulitis-associated abscesses can be treated with broad-spectrum antimicrobials or percutaneous drainage. Emergency surgery is considered standard treatment only in patients with acute peritonitis (Hinchey, stages III and IV).

Acute diverticulitis — antibiotic regimen and coverage guidance notes no preferred regimen or route/duration, indicates antibiotics for all complicated cases, and advises spectrum based on stewardship principles. There is no evidence to support a particular antibiotic regime, route, or duration for complicated acute diverticulitis. Antibiotics are indicated in all complicated acute diverticulitis cases. If a drainage procedure is indicated, there is no evidence to support a prolonged course of antibiotics after source control is achieved. Our expert panel recommended that antibiotic use covers gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria based on institutional protocols and antibiotic stewardship principles. (LoE: very low. Strength of recommendation: strong).

Amoxicillin–clavulanic acid — empiric therapy considerations for intra-abdominal infection (IAI): The literature search did not identify any RCTs published since 2000 evaluating this agent, and a small prospective trial comparing IV amoxicillin–clavulanic acid plus metronidazole versus IV ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole found lower success rates with the amoxicillin–clavulanic acid regimen, although not statistically significant. An observational study from The Netherlands reported amoxicillin–clavulanic acid-resistant E. coli was increasingly common and use of this agent in such patients was associated with increased death. Susceptibility of E. coli to amoxicillin–clavulanic acid was 50%–51%, only marginally better than ampicillin–sulbactam (45%–47%). Because of these efficacy and resistance concerns and lack of recent RCTs, the task force does not support use of amoxicillin–clavulanic acid for empiric treatment of patients with IAI; IV preparation is not available in the United States.

### Observational versus antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis: an individual-patient data meta-analysis [^74395565]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

The decision to treat patients with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis with antibiotics or not does not depend on a single outcome measure. All reasons in favour of using antibiotics and all reasons in favour of omitting them should be taken into account. Omitting antibiotics did not increase the risk of ongoing diverticulitis, recurrent diverticulitis, complicated diverticulitis or sigmoid resection, and is therefore a safe treatment strategy. Insufficient statistical power to detect small differences in complicated diverticulitis and sigmoid resection may leave some room for discussion if these small differences are considered clinically relevant. Furthermore, the use of antibiotics should be limited as much as possible to minimize the global threat of rising microbial resistance and to prevent antibiotic‐related morbidity (8·3 per cent of all patients in DIABOLO 2), including potentially life‐threatening allergic reactions. In the end, individual‐patient characteristics or preferences may be deciding factors in the decision‐making process. However, in subgroups of patients with independent risk factors for adverse outcome (high pain scores, high WBC and a history of acute diverticulitis at presentation) no beneficial role for antibiotics in the prevention of such adverse outcomes was found.

### Outpatient treatment of patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis [^773b6ff6]. Colorectal Disease (2010). Low credibility.

Aim

Evidence supporting outpatient treatment with oral antibiotics in patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis is limited. Our aim was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an ambulatory treatment protocol in patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis.

Method

All patients diagnosed with uncomplicated diverticulitis based on abdominal computed tomography findings from June 2003 to December 2008 were considered for outpatient treatment. Admission was indicated in patients not able to tolerate oral intake and those with comorbidity or without adequate family support. Treatment consisted of oral antibiotics for 7 days (amoxicillin-clavulanic or ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole in patients with penicillin allergy). Patients were seen again at between 4 and 7 days after starting treatment to confirm symptom improvement.

Results

Ninety-six patients were diagnosed with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis and 26 presented at least one criterion for admission. Ambulatory treatment was initiated in 70 (73%) patients. Only two (3%) required admission because of persisting abdominal pain and vomiting, respectively. Intravenous antibiotics resolved the inflammatory process in both cases. In the remaining 68 (97%), ambulatory treatment was completed without complication.

Conclusion

Ambulatory treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is safe, effective and applicable to most patients with tolerance to oral intake and without severe comorbidity and having appropriate family support.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: routine use of antibiotics for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis [^5b5edf6b]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The treatment of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis (UD) with antibiotics remains common despite substantial evidence supporting the non-inferiority of nonantibiotic outpatient management. In the past 15 years, there have been two landmark randomized-controlled clinical trials, follow-up studies, and numerous retrospective studies that have supported the non-inferiority of nonantibiotic management of UD. Multiple medical societies including the American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Physicians recommend using antibiotics selectively rather than routinely in UD. We aim to raise physician awareness of the latest guideline recommendations through our article, potentially improving antibiotic stewardship and reducing related healthcare costs.

### A proposal for a CT driven classification of left colon acute diverticulitis [^53ef0487]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Stage 1 A

Stage 1 A diverticulitis is a confined inflammatory process that may include a microperforation but excludes an abscess, and/or peritonitis. CT findings include pericolic air in the form of air bubbles or little pericolic fluid without abscess. Pericolic air is defined as air bubbles or air collection within 5 cm of the inflamed bowel segment without distant air (Figure 3). Patients have left iliac fossa pain, initial localized tenderness and there are usually signs of sepsis. Small locules of pericolic air is a feature of a (micro) perforation of a diverticulum. Stage 1 A diverticulitis may progress to more complicated clinical forms if it is not treated promptly. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are therefore indicated in stage 1 A patients. Antibiotics should be always given to the patients with pericolic air or small fluid collection. Various antimicrobial regimens may be used in the treatment of acute diverticulitis in order to ensure complete coverage against Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and aerobic–anaerobic bacterial strains. Antimicrobial regimens with beta-lactamase inhibiting antibiotics such as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole are appropriate for community acquired acute diverticulitis, although high rates of resistance to quinolones have reported in many countries. In critically ill patients or in immunocompromised patients broader-spectrum regimens should be used. An appropriate antimicrobial therapy given for an appropriate duration has minimal impact on the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.

Figure 3
Diverticular disease, colonic wall thickening, fat stranding and pericolic fluid and air bubbles.

Patients with CT findings of pericolic air and signs of sepsis and initial tenderness should require bowel rest, intravenous fluid hydration and empirical intravenous antimicrobial therapy. In these patients to optimize antimicrobial therapy and minimize hospital stay, antimicrobial therapy may be started initially intravenously and switched to oral therapy as soon as clinical conditions improve.

Patients with pericolic air or small fluid collection should be managed by antimicrobial therapy. Patients with signs of sepsis and initial tenderness should demand bowel rest, intravenous fluid hydration and empirical intravenous antimicrobial therapy. In these patients intravenous antimicrobial therapy may be switched to oral therapy as soon as clinical conditions improve.

Clinical findings should be sufficient to monitor resolution of the acute episode. In patients who have persistent or recurrent clinical evidence of intra-abdominal infection after 4–6 days of therapy, new CT imaging should be undertaken.

### Observational versus antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis: an individual-patient data meta-analysis [^913d93b4]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Uncomplicated acute diverticulitis has been treated routinely with antibiotics for decades, although several guidelines have adapted their recommendations meanwhile. These now state that antibiotics should not be used routinely or can be avoided 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Some guidelines, however, state that antibiotics 'should be used selectively' (American Gastroenterological Association Institute guideline 11), antibiotics 'should be given to patients with risk indications of a complicated course' (German guideline 9), or antibiotics 'on a case‐by‐case basis should possibly be considered' (Italian guideline 8).

Little is known, however, about risk factors for a complicated course of initially uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. Therefore, guidelines cannot recommend antibiotics for specific patient subgroups, besides subgroups that were excluded from studies on this topic such as immunocompromised patients and women. The present meta‐analysis identified several risk factors for one or more adverse outcomes that can guide the selection of patients who may benefit from antibiotics. However, the results showed that omitting antibiotics does not increase the risk of adverse outcomes in these high‐risk patients. Therefore, prevention of these adverse outcomes with antibiotic treatment may not be warranted.

### Randomized controlled trial of oral vs intravenous therapy for the clinically diagnosed acute uncomplicated diverticulitis [^a97a5a3e]. Colorectal Disease (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Despite the high prevalence of hospitalization for left iliac fossa tenderness, there is a striking lack of randomized data available to guide therapy. The authors hypothesize that an oral antibiotic and fluids are not inferior to intravenous (IV) antibiotics and 'bowel rest' in clinically diagnosed acute uncomplicated diverticulitis.

Method

A randomized controlled trial was constructed in two District General Hospitals. All clinically diagnosed patients presenting with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis were eligible for the study. Oral and IV regimens utilizing ciprofloxacin and metronidazole were compared. The primary outcomes studied were surrogates for resolution of symptoms (including tenderness on day 3 and length of stay) and failure of oral therapy. Secondary endpoints studied were serial constitutional and biomarker trends.

Results

There were 41 patients in the oral arm and 38 in the IV arm (n = 79). No patient had to be converted to IV antibiotics from the oral group. There was a complete resolution of symptoms in both groups. Tenderness was equivalent in both groups on day 3. Among secondary endpoints, a serial decrease in C reactive protein was the best serological predictor of resolution for both groups.

Conclusion

Oral antibiotics are not inferior to intravenous antibiotics in achieving resolution of clinically diagnosed diverticulitis.

The study DINAMO-study was published by Laura Mora-López and colleagues in 2021 in the journal Ann Surg. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute diverticulitis. In the DINAMO-study study, the trial question was: is nonantibiotic outpatient treatment noninferior to antibiotic treatment in patients with mild acute diverticulitis? In the DINAMO-study study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the DINAMO-study study, the population was: 480 patients (256 female, 224 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients consulting the emergency department with symptoms of acute diverticulitis. The key exclusion criteria were age < 18 years or > 80 years; allergy to any of the study drugs; modified Neff grade I or upper acute diverticulitis; acute diverticulitis episode in the last 3 months; antibiotic treatment for any reason in the last 2 weeks; presence of significant comorbidities. In the DINAMO-study study, the interventions were: n = 242 non-antibiotic (anti-inflammatory and symptomatic treatment with 600 mg/8 hour ibuprofen alternating with 1 g/8 hour acetaminophen) n = 238 antibiotic (875 mg/125 mg/8 hour amoxicillin/clavulanate apart from anti-inflammatory and symptomatic treatment). In the DINAMO-study study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in hospital admission (3.3% vs. 5.8%; ARD -2.58, 95% CI -1.17 to 6.32). In the DINAMO-study study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in emergency department revisits (7% vs. 6.7%; AD 0.3%, 95% CI -4.83 to 4.22) No significant difference in patients with poor pain control at 2 days (2.3% vs. 5.7%; ARD -3.39, 95% CI -0.18 to 6.96). In the DINAMO-study study, the conclusion was: in adult patients consulting the emergency department with symptoms of acute diverticulitis, non-antibiotic was noninferior to antibiotic with respect to hospital admission.

### WSES guidelines for the management of acute left sided colonic diverticulitis in the emergency setting [^f44cb444]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

A multi-centre randomized trial involving ten surgical departments in Sweden and one in Iceland recruited 623 patients with computed tomography-verified acute uncomplicated left-sided diverticulitis was published in 2012 by Chabok et al. Patients were randomized to treatment with (314 patients) or without (309 patients) antibiotics. Antibiotic treatment for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis neither accelerated recovery nor prevented complications or recurrence. It should therefore be reserved for the treatment of complicated diverticulitis.

A recent prospective single-arm study analyzed the safety and efficacy of symptomatic (nonantibiotic) treatment for CT-proven uncomplicated diverticulitis during a 30-day follow-up period. Overall, 161 patients were included in the study, and 153 (95%) completed the 30-day follow-up. A total of 14 (9%) patients had pericolic air. Altogether, 140 (87%) patients were treated as outpatients, and 4 (3%) of them were admitted to the hospital during the follow-up. None of the patients developed complicated diverticulitis or required surgery, but, 2 days (median) after inclusion, antibiotics were given to 14 (9%, 6 orally, 8 intravenously) patients.

However the high mortality associated with sepsis, requires clinicians to maintain a high index of clinical suspicion, in the conditions that predispose to sepsis. WSES expert panel suggests antimicrobial therapy covering Gram negative and anaerobes in patients with radiological documented uncomplicated acute diverticulitis associated with systemic manifestations of infection.

An appropriate antimicrobial regimen administered for an adequate duration has minimal impact on the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.

If antimicrobial therapy is necessary oral administration of antibiotics may be equally as effective as intravenous administration.

A randomized controlled trial of oral versus intravenous therapy for clinically diagnosed acute uncomplicated diverticulitis was published in 2009. Oral and intravenous regimens utilizing ciprofloxacin and metronidazole were compared. There were 41 patients in the oral arm and 38 in the IV arm (n = 79). No patients had to be converted to intravenous antibiotics from the oral group. There was a complete resolution of symptoms in both groups.

More importantly, it will review the emerging body of evidence supporting the use of 5-aminosalicylic acid and probiotics for symptomatic or complicated DD. Possible mechanisms supporting the role of 5-aminosalicylates will also be discussed. On the basis of strength of the evidence supporting each medical intervention, recommendations will be graded in an evidence-based fashion. Finally, an evidence-based algorithmic approach is proposed for the medical management of DD. This paper does not discuss the use of absorbable antibiotics such as ciprofloxin and metronidazole, which are discussed in all standard textbooks.

Specific Populations

Elderly

Pharmacokinetic studies of the oral (single dose) and intravenous (single and multiple dose) forms of ciprofloxacin indicate that plasma concentrations of ciprofloxacin are higher in elderly subjects (older than 65 years) as compared to young adults. Although the Cmaxis increased 16% to 40%, the increase in mean AUC is approximately 30%, and can be at least partially attributed to decreased renal clearance in the elderly. Elimination half-life is only slightly (~20%) prolonged in the elderly. These differences are not considered clinically significant [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

Renal Impairment

In patients with reduced renal function, the half-life of ciprofloxacin is slightly prolonged. Dosage adjustments may be required [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Hepatic Impairment

In preliminary studies in patients with stable chronic liver cirrhosis, no significant changes in ciprofloxacin pharmacokinetics have been observed. The kinetics of ciprofloxacin in patients with acute hepatic insufficiency, have not been fully studied.

Pediatrics

Table 14 summarizes pharmacokinetic parameters in pediatric patients aged less than 1 to less than 12 years of age receiving intravenous treatment.

These values are within the range reported for adults at therapeutic doses. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis of pediatric patients with various infections, the predicted mean half-life in children is approximately 4 hours –5 hours, and the bioavailability of the oral suspension is approximately 60%.

Antacids

Concurrent administration of antacids containing magnesium hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide may reduce the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by as much as 90% [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7)].

Histamine H2-receptor antagonists

Histamine H2-receptor antagonists appear to have no significant effect on the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin.

Metronidazole

The serum concentrations of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole were not altered when these two drugs were given concomitantly.

Tizanidine

In a pharmacokinetic study, systemic exposure of tizanidine (4 mg single dose) was significantly increased (Cmax7-fold, AUC 10-fold) when the drug was given concomitantly with CIPRO (500 mg twice a day for 3 days). Concomitant administration of tizanidine and CIPRO is contraindicated due to the potentiation of hypotensive and sedative effects of tizanidine [see Contraindications (4.2)].

### Nonoperative treatment of diverticulitis and appendicitis: which antibiotic regimen fails? [^657fa36a]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diverticulitis and appendicitis are common emergency general surgical conditions. Both can be treated with antibiotics alone; however, no antibiotic regimen has been identified as superior to others. In this study, we review different antibiotic regimens and their rates of failure.

Methods

Retrospective cohort study of patients treated empirically with antibiotics for diverticulitis or appendicitis from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2020, at an independent academic hospital in the Midwest.

Results

A total of 587 (appendicitis, n = 43; diverticulitis, n = 544) patients were included in the cohort. They were equally male (49%) and female (51%) with a median age of 59 y. Three major antibiotic classes were compared: cephalosporin + metronidazole (C + M), penicillins, and quinolone + metronidazole. Appendicitis patients were more likely to receive C + M for empiric treatment (73%, P < 0.001), while diverticulitis patients were more likely to receive quinolone + metronidazole (45%, P < 0.001). Patients empirically treated with antibiotics for appendicitis were more likely than those treated for diverticulitis to require additional antibiotics or procedure within 90 d (33% versus 13%, respectively; P = 0.005). Empiric treatment with C + M for diverticulitis was more likely to be associated with the need for additional antibiotics or procedures within 90 d than treatment with other regimens (P = 0.003). Choice of antibiotic for empiric treatment did not correlate with death at 90 d for appendicitis or diverticulitis. Diverticulitis patients who were initially treated as inpatients and were prescribed C + M at hospital discharge had a higher rate of death than those who were prescribed the other antibiotics (P = 0.04).

Conclusions

Empiric antibiotic treatment of appendicitis is more likely to be associated with additional antibiotics or procedure when compared with diverticulitis; however, antibiotic choice did not correlate with any of the other outcomes. Empiric treatment with a C + M for diverticulitis was more likely to be correlated with the need for additional antibiotics or procedure within 90 d.

Acute diverticulitis — antibiotic use and generalizability of evidence are described: Two recent randomized trials and 2 systematic reviews have reported no clear benefit and questioned the routine use of antibiotics, as does this guideline, suggesting selective and individualized use. Further, the patients studied were inpatients with uncomplicated disease confirmed by computed tomography (CT); therefore, the results should not be generalized to complicated patients (those with abscesses or fistulas), those with severe infection or sepsis, immunosuppressed patients, or patients with significant comorbidities. Outpatient management without antibiotics has not been studied, although we would expect these patients to have generally milder disease and logically equal or better outcomes.

### Diverticulitis: a review [^b80db9c7]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Diverticulosis is defined by the presence of multiple outpouchings (diverticula) originating from the intestinal lumen. Diverticulitis is defined as inflammation of these diverticula. The annual incidence of diverticulitis in the US is approximately 180 per 100 000 people, resulting in approximately 200 000 hospital admissions annually and an estimated health care expenditure of more than $6.3 billion/year.

Observations

Risk factors for diverticular disease include age older than 65 years, genetic factors such as variant in the tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 15 (TNFSFI5) gene; connective tissue diseases such as polycystic kidney disease, Marfan syndrome, or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome; body mass index 30 or greater; use of opioids, steroids, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications; hypertension; and type 2 diabetes. Approximately 1% to 4% of patients with diverticulosis will develop acute diverticulitis in their lifetime, which typically presents as left lower quadrant pain associated with nausea, vomiting, fever, and leukocytosis. A contrast-enhanced abdominal and pelvic computed tomography scan is the recommended diagnostic test and has a sensitivity of 98% to 99% and specificity of 99% to 100%. Approximately 85% of people with acute diverticulitis have uncomplicated diverticulitis (absence of abscess, colon strictures, colon perforation, or fistula formation). Management of patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis consists of observation with pain management (typically acetaminophen) and dietary modification with a clear liquid diet. Antibiotics should be reserved for patients with systemic symptoms such as persistent fever or chills, those with increasing leukocytosis, those older than 80 years, those who are pregnant, those who are immunocompromised (receiving chemotherapy, or high-dose steroids, or have received an organ transplant), and those with chronic medical conditions (such as cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, or poorly controlled diabetes). First-line antibiotics consist of oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or cefalexin with metronidazole. For patients who cannot tolerate oral intake, intravenous antibiotic therapy (ie, cefuroxime or ceftriaxone plus metronidazole or ampicillin/sulbactam) is appropriate. Complicated diverticulitis is managed with intravenous antibiotics such as ceftriaxone plus metronidazole or piperacillin-tazobactam and additional invasive management as indicated (ie, percutaneous drainage of associated intra-abdominal abscess or colon resection). Patients with generalized peritonitis should undergo emergent laparotomy with colonic resection. Postoperative mortality for diverticulitis managed electively or emergently is 0.5% for elective colon resection and 10.6% for emergent colon resection.

Conclusions and Relevance

In the US, diverticulitis affects approximately 180 per 100 000 people annually. For uncomplicated diverticulitis, first-line therapy is observation and pain control, and antibiotics should be initiated for patients with persistent fevers, increasing leukocytosis, sepsis or septic shock, advanced age, pregnancy, immunocompromise, and certain chronic medical conditions. Treatment of complicated diverticulitis includes intravenous antibiotics, such as ceftriaxone plus metronidazole or piperacillin-tazobactam, and, if indicated, percutaneous drainage of abscess or resection of diseased segment of colon.

The new study provides useful insights on the natural history of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. The most intriguing data compared rates of elective sigmoid resection between the groups. There was a trend toward more elective surgery in the observation group compared to those in the antibiotic group. It might be too soon to abandon antibiotics for uncomplicated diverticulitis.

### Outcome variation in the use and duration of antibiotic therapy in patients presenting with acute diverticulitis [^96f61aeb]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

With some institutions adopting a no-antibiotics approach to patients with acute diverticulitis, our data suggest comparable or even improved outcomes in patients who are selected for this approach. Among those who receive antibiotics, shorter- vs. longer-durations of treatment do not seem to reduce episodes of recurrent disease. Indeed, those given longer courses were more likely to require eventual surgery than those with shorter durations. These data support institutional consideration for antibiotic-sparing protocols in appropriately selected patients with diverticulitis. Further, they suggest that longer courses of antibiotics are associated with worse outcomes, including higher rates of subsequent antibiotic use and surgery. Finally, there is a persistent need for investigation into obese, older, and comorbid individuals and the viability of antibiotic sparing approaches in these cohorts that increasingly represent the US population.

### Patient and physician preferences for antibiotics in acute uncomplicated diverticulitis: a Delphi consensus process to generate noninferiority margins [^7cd4b8d8]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite the existing evidence, the omission of antibiotics in the management of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis has not gained widespread acceptance.

Objective

This study aims to incorporate the input of both patients and physicians on the omission of antibiotics in uncomplicated diverticulitis to generate noninferiority margins for 3 outcomes.

Design

This was a mixed-methods study, including in-person interviews with patients and a Delphi process with physicians.

Settings

North American patients and physicians participated.

Patients

Consecutive patients undergoing colonoscopy, 40% of whom had a previous history of diverticulitis, were selected.

Interventions

Informational video (for patients) and evidence summaries (for physicians) regarding antibiotics in diverticulitis were reviewed.

Main Outcomes Measures

Noninferiority margins were generated for time to reach full recovery, persistent diverticulitis, and progression to complicated diverticulitis in the context of a nonantibiotic strategy. Consensus was defined as an interquartile range < 2.5.

Results

Fifty patients participated in this study. To avoid antibiotics, patients were willing to accept up to 5.0 (3.0–7.0) days longer to reach full recovery, up to an absolute increase of 4.0% (4.0–6.0) in the risk of developing persistent diverticulitis, and up to an absolute increase of 2.0% (0–3.8) in the risk of progressing to complicated diverticulitis. A total of 55 physicians participated in the Delphi (round 1 response rate = 94.8%; round 2 response rate = 100%). Consensus noninferiority margins were generated for persistent diverticulitis (4.0%, 4.0–5.0) and progression to complicated diverticulitis (3.0%, 2.0–3.0), but could not be generated for time to reach full recovery (5.0 days, 3.5–7.0).

Limitations

Patients were recruited from a single institution, and Delphi participants were invited and not randomly selected.

Conclusion

Noninferiority margins were generated for 3 important outcomes after the treatment of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis in the context of a nonantibiotic strategy.

We suggest use of oral amoxicillin–clavulanic acid as an acceptable regimen for adults and children older than one month (Grade 2-B). We suggest use of oral moxifloxacin as an acceptable regimen for adults (Grade 2-B), and we do not recommend the use of oral moxifloxacin for the treatment of IAI in children, unless no other option is available (Grade 1-B). We recommend use of oral ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole as an acceptable regimen for adults (Grade 1-B), and we suggest that oral ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole may be used in children older than one month, if other options are not suitable (Grade 2-B). We suggest that oral levofloxacin plus metronidazole, an oral first-, second-, or third-generation cephalosporin plus metronidazole, or oral trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole plus metronidazole are potential regimens that could be used selectively to complete a short course of antibiotic therapy in adults and children older than one month, if other oral agents are not suitable (Grade 2-C).

HAVE BEEN REPORTS OF INDIVIDUALS WITH A HISTORY OF PENICILLIN HYPERSENSITIVITY
WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED SEVERE REACTIONS WHEN TREATED WITH CEPHALOSPORINS. BEFORE
INITIATING THERAPY WITH AUGMENTIN, CAREFUL INQUIRY SHOULD BE MADE CONCERNING

REACTIONS REQUIRE IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE. OXYGEN,
INTRAVENOUS STEROIDS, AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING INTUBATION, SHOULD ALSO
BE ADMINISTERED AS INDICATED.

Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD)
has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including
AUGMENTIN, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis.
Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading
to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which
contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile. cause increased morbidity and mortality, as
these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require
colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea
following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has
been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial
agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed
against C. difficile. may need to be discontinued.
Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation,
antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical
evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

AUGMENTIN should be used with caution in patients with evidence of hepatic
dysfunction. Hepatic toxicity associated with the use of AUGMENTIN is usually
reversible. On rare occasions, deaths have been reported (less than 1 death
reported per estimated 4 million prescriptions worldwide). These have generally
been cases associated with serious underlying diseases or concomitant
medications. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Liver.)

### The WSES / SICG / ACOI / SICUT / AcEMC / SIFIPAC guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of acute left colonic diverticulitis in the elderly [^c1e291c3]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

According to the WSES guidelines, the empirically planned antimicrobial regimen is based on the patient's underlying clinical condition, the microorganisms suspected of being involved, and risk factors for significant resistance patterns.﻿ The principles of empiric antibiotic treatment should be developed based on the most commonly isolated microorganisms, while also taking into account the local trend of antibiotic resistance. The presence of anaerobes and Gram-negative bacteria in the lower gastrointestinal tract should be taken into account while choosing empirical therapy for acute diverticulitis. In addition, quinolone and carbapenem resistance, as well as the presence of ESBL-producing bacteria in the local environment and the location of recent travel, should always be taken into account.

Because inoculation in a healthcare facility, corticosteroid usage, organ transplantation, baseline pulmonary or hepatic disease, and past anti-microbial therapy are the most relevant factors in predicting the presence of resistant bacteria, elderly individuals frequently fall into this category. One of the factors that is significantly linked to poor outcomes in critically ill patients is an ineffective or inadequate antimicrobial treatment. In patients with organ dysfunction and septic shock, broad empiric antimicrobial therapy should be started as soon as possible.

Furthermore, for individuals at risk for resistant bacteria, intraperitoneal samples for microbiological evaluation are always indicated from the site of infection. When the findings of microbiological tests are available, the patient should be reviewed, and antimicrobial de-escalation or withdrawal should be considered.
15 When should discontinuation of anti-microbial treatment be considered?

Statement 15.1 In elderly patients with complicated diverticulitis a short course of antibiotic therapy (3–5 days) after adequate source control is a reasonable option. [Conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence]
Statement 15.2 In elderly patients with complicated diverticulitis who have ongoing signs of peritonitis or systemic illness (ongoing infection) beyond 5 to 7 days of antibiotic treatment, further diagnostic investigation is indicated. [Conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence]

The outcomes after 4 days of antibiotic therapy were similar to those following a longer course of antibiotics in patients with intraabdominal infections who completed an acceptable source control regimen.

Although discontinuation of anti-microbial treatment should be based on clinical criteria, a 4–6 day period of postoperative anti-microbial therapy in complicated ALCD is suggested if source control has been adequate. Patients who have persistent symptoms of peritonitis or systemic sickness (ongoing infection) after 5 to 7 days of antibiotic treatment should be re-evaluated.

What is the best treatment for patients with a small diverticular abscess (< 4–5 cm)? What is the best treatment for patients with large diverticular abscess?

For patients with a small (< 4–5 cm) diverticular abscess, we suggest an initial trial of non-operative treatment with antibiotics alone (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

We suggest to treat patients with large abscesses with percutaneous drainage combined with antibiotic treatment; whenever percutaneous drainage of the abscess is not feasible or not available, we suggest to initially treat patients with large abscesses with antibiotic therapy alone, clinical conditions permitting. Alternatively, an operative intervention is required (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

Approximately 15–20% of patients admitted with acute diverticulitis have an abscess on CT scan. The treatment of abscess always requires antibiotic therapy. If the abscess is limited in size, systemic antibiotic therapy alone is considered safe and effective in removing the abscess and solving acute inflammation with a pooled failure rate of 20% and a mortality rate of 0.6%.

Prevention of recurrence following an episode of AD

After one episode of AD, 15–30% of patients will develop a recurrent episode, although a recent large population-based cohort study reported a lower 11.2% recurrence rate of hospital admission, lower than previously reported, which seems greater in women and younger people. The second episode carries another 30% risk of having a third event, but the first episode seems the most severe. Patients also present often chronic abdominal pain after an AD event that may be difficult to manage. Although quality evidence is still insufficient to identify the best preventive treatment, several secondary prevention strategies have been suggested and include a high-fiber diet, cyclic antibiotic treatment with rifaximin, probiotics, mesalazine treatment, and avoiding NSAIDs. The role of surgery is discussed below (Table 4).

Baseline characteristics

The mean(s.d.) age of the patients was 61(13) years and 40·7 per cent were men. The mean BMI of the total cohort was 27·8(5·7) kg/m 2. Some 271 patients (60·6 per cent) had co‐morbidities and 123 (27·5 per cent) had an ASA fitness grade above II. The mean CRP level was 168(106) mg/l for the total cohort and mean WBC was 14·8(5·2) × 10⁹ /l.

Most patients were treated with amoxicillin–clavulanic acid (90 of 289, 31·1 per cent), cefuroxime and metronidazole (88 of 289, 30·4 per cent), ceftriaxone and metronidazole (41 of 289, 14·2 per cent), or other antibiotics (70 of 289, 24·2 per cent) such as clindamycin, co‐trimoxazole or piperacillin tazobactam; median duration of antibiotic treatment was 7 (i.q.r. 5–12) days. Information on route of antibiotic administration was available for 174 of 332 patients in the no‐PCD group and 67 of 115 in the PCD group; 36 (20·6 per cent) and six (9 per cent) patients respectively received oral antibiotics. Most patients (332, 74·3 per cent) were initially treated without PCD; the remaining 115 patients (26·7 per cent) underwent PCD for a median of 6 (3–16) days. The PCD approach was mainly transabdominal (86 of 115, 74·8 per cent), guided by either ultrasound imaging (49 of 115, 42·6 per cent) or CT (63 of 115, 54·8 per cent). Median duration of hospital stay was 7 (5–13) days and median follow‐up was 72 (55–93) months.

### A phase 3 randomized trial of sulopenem vs. ertapenem in patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections [^5cfe5bb7]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To demonstrate the non-inferiority of intravenous (IV) sulopenem to IV ertapenem, each followed by an oral regimen, in adults with complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI).

Methods

Hospitalized adults with cIAI were randomly assigned to 5 days of IV sulopenem followed by oral sulopenem etzadroxil/probenecid twice daily or 5 days of IV ertapenem followed by oral ciprofloxacin/metronidazole or amoxicillin-clavulanate depending on baseline pathogen susceptibility. The target treatment duration was 7–10 days. The primary (FDA [Food and Drug Administration]-specified) endpoint was clinical response at day 28 (test-of-cure) in the micro-modified intent-to-treat (micro-MITT) population.

Results

A total of 674 patients were randomly assigned. The two treatment arms were well balanced. Escherichia coli (395 patients) and Bacteroides fragilis (111 patients) were the most frequently isolated pathogens. Clinical success rates in the micro-MITT population were 81.9% (204/249) for sulopenem-treated patients and 87.9% (233/265) for ertapenem-treated patients. The lower bound of the CI for the treatment difference of the primary endpoint was below the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -10.0 (treatment difference -6.0%, 95% CI, [-12.2 to 0.2]). In all other analysis populations, the lower limit of the 95% CI was above -10.0. Treatment-emergent adverse events (all, 26.0% [87/335] vs. 23.4% [78/333]; related, 6.0% [20/335] vs. 5.1% [17/333]) were similar for sulopenem and ertapenem, respectively. Most events were mild to moderate in severity. There were more serious adverse events in the sulopenem arm (7.5% [25/335] vs. 3.6% [12/333]), only two of which were considered possibly drug-related.

Discussion

Sulopenem IV followed by oral sulopenem etzadroxil/probenecid was not non-inferior to ertapenem followed by oral step-down in treating cIAI in the micro-MITT population. This finding should be interpreted in the context of country regulations, as endpoint timing, primary analysis population and non-inferiority margin may vary regionally. Both IV and oral sulopenem were well-tolerated; the oral formulation allowed patients with resistant pathogens to step-down from IV therapy.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute diverticulitis, more specifically with respect to blood cultures, IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend to avoid obtaining routine blood cultures in non-immunocompromised adult
and pediatric patients with suspected intra-abdominal infections having a normal/elevated temperature without hypotension, tachypnea, or delirium, and there is no concern for antibiotic-resistant organisms that would inform the treatment regimen.

### Observational versus antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis: an individual-patient data meta-analysis [^ce5c5876]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

This individual‐patient data meta‐analysis included 1109 patients, 545 in the observational group and 564 in the antibiotics group. Duration of follow‐up was comparable between the groups: 12·3 (i.q.r. 12·1–13·0) months in the observational group and 12·4 (12·1–13·0) months in the antibiotics group. Baseline characteristics were mostly comparable; however, primary diverticulitis was slightly but significantly more common in the antibiotics group (Table 2).

Observational versus antibiotic treatment

The duration of stay for the initial hospital admission was slightly but non‐significantly shorter in the observational group compared with the antibiotics group (median 2 versus 3 days respectively; P = 0·037) (Table 3). Some 33 of 1109 patients (3·0 per cent) were treated as outpatients from the start of treatment. The rate of ongoing diverticulitis differed somewhat, but this difference failed to reach statistical significance: 7·2 per cent (39 of 545) in observational group versus 5·0 per cent (28 of 564) in the antibiotics group (P = 0·062). The rates of recurrent diverticulitis were comparable: 8·6 per cent (47 of 545) versus 9·6 per cent (54 of 564) respectively (P = 0·610). Complicated diverticulitis and sigmoid resection rates were recorded during the acute disease stage (within 1 month) and at 1‐year follow‐up. Rates of complicated diverticulitis within 1 month were comparable between groups: 1·8 per cent (10 of 545) in the observational group versus 1·1 per cent (6 of 564) in antibiotics group (P = 0·204); at 1‐year follow‐up they differed somewhat (by 10 patients), but non‐significantly: 4·0 per cent (22 of 545) versus 2·1 per cent (12 of 564) respectively (P = 0·079). Rates of sigmoid resection were no different between the groups at 1 month (0·6 per cent (3 of 545) versus 0·7 per cent (4 of 564); P = 0·818) or 1 year (5·0 per cent (27 of 545) versus 2·5 per cent (14 of 564); P = 0·214).

### Antibiotics for uncomplicated diverticulitis [^337c5213]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Diverticulitis is a complication of the common condition, diverticulosis. Uncomplicated diverticulitis has traditionally been treated with antibiotics, as diverticulitis has been regarded as an infectious disease. Risk factors for diverticulitis, however, may suggest that the condition is inflammatory rather than infectious which makes the use of antibiotics questionable.

Objectives

The objectives of this systematic review were to determine if antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis affects the risk of complications (immediate or late) or the need for emergency surgery.

Search Methods

For this update, a comprehensive systematic literature search was conducted in Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trial Registry Platform on February 2021.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including all types of patients with a radiologically confirmed diagnosis of left-sided uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. Comparator and interventions included antibiotics compared to no antibiotics, placebo, or to any other antibiotic treatment (different regimens, routes of administration, dosage or duration of treatment). Primary outcome measures were complications and emergency surgery. Secondary outcomes were recurrence, late complications, elective colonic resections, length of hospital stay, length to recovery of symptoms, adverse events and mortality.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors performed the searches, identification and assessment of RCTs and data extraction. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or involvement of the third author. Authors of trials were contacted to obtain additional data if needed or for preliminary results of ongoing trials. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias was used to assess the methodological quality of the identified trials. The overall quality of evidence for outcomes was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Effect estimates were extracted as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed with the Mantel-Haenzel method.

Main Results

The authors included five studies. Three studies compared no antibiotics to antibiotics; all three were original RCTs of which two also published long-term follow-up information. For the outcome of short-term complications there may be little or no difference between antibiotics and no antibiotics (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.30 to 2.62; 3 studies, 1329 participants; low-certainty evidence). The rate of emergency surgery within 30 days may be lower with no antibiotics compared to antibiotics (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.13, 1.71; 1329 participants; 3 studies; low-certainty evidence). However, there is considerable imprecision due to wide confidence intervals for this effect estimate causing uncertainty which means that there may also be a benefit with antibiotics. One of the two remaining trials compared single to double compound antibiotic therapy and, due to wide confidence intervals, the estimate was imprecise and indicated an uncertain clinical effect between these two antibiotic regimens (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.11 to 4.58; 51 participants; 1 study; low-certainty evidence). The last trial compared short to long intravenous administration of antibiotics and did not report any events for our primary outcomes. Both trials included few participants and one had overall high risk of bias. Since the first publication of this systematic review, an increasing amount of evidence supporting the treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis without antibiotics has been published, but the total body of evidence is still limited.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence on antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated acute diverticulitis suggests that the effect of antibiotics is uncertain for complications, emergency surgery, recurrence, elective colonic resections, and long-term complications. The quality of the evidence is low. Only three RCTs on the need for antibiotics are currently available. More trials are needed to obtain more precise effect estimates.

### Emerging evidence and recent controversies in diverticulitis: a 5-year review [^8a572a50]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite the longtime prevalence of diverticulitis as one of the most common gastrointestinal diseases in both the inpatient and outpatient setting, its etiology, prevention, and treatment remain hotly contested. Once viewed as a disorder of primarily older people in western populations, diverticulitis has rapidly increased its presence in all age groups worldwide, prompting researchers to reexamine the pathophysiology of the disease process. Clinicians continue to push the envelope with novel approaches to management, from avoiding antibiotics for uncomplicated cases to identifying subsets of patients with complicated diverticulitis who may not require an operation. Here, we review the most recent literature on a wide array of topics in diverticulitis, with an emphasis on publications within the last 5 years.

6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Two clinical trials evaluated the safety of a 10-day treatment course of AUGMENTIN ES-600 90/6.4 mg/kg/day, divided every 12 hours, in pediatric patients with acute otitis media [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The first trial involved 521 pediatric patients (3 months to 50 months) and the second trial involved 450 pediatric patients (3 months to 12 years). In the intent-to-treat population of the first trial of 521 patients, the most frequently reported adverse events were vomiting (7%), fever (6%), contact dermatitis (i.e., diaper rash) (6%), upper respiratory tract infection (4%), and diarrhea (4%). Protocol-defined diarrhea (i.e., 3 or more watery stools in one day or 2 watery stools per day for 2 consecutive days as recorded on diary cards) occurred in 13% of patients.

The primary objective of the second study was to compare the safety of AUGMENTIN ES-600 (90/6.4 mg/kg/day, divided every 12 hours) to AUGMENTIN (45/6.4 mg/kg/day, divided every 12 hours) for ten days. There was no statistically significant difference between treatments in the proportion of patients with 1 or more adverse events. The most frequently reported adverse reactions for AUGMENTIN ES-600 and the comparator of AUGMENTIN were coughing (12% versus 7%), vomiting (7% versus 8%), contact dermatitis (i.e., diaper rash, 6% versus 5%), fever (6% versus 4%), and upper respiratory infection (3% versus 9%), respectively. The frequencies of protocol-defined diarrhea with AUGMENTIN ES-600 (11%) and AUGMENTIN (9%) were not statistically different. Two patients in the group treated with AUGMENTIN ES-600 and one patient in the group treated with AUGMENTIN were withdrawn due to diarrhea.

5 Uncomplicated Diverticulitis

Little data exists to support optimal medical management of diverticulitis in older or frail adults. Historically, management of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis involved inpatient admission with intravenous antibiotics and bowel rest. Following several large randomized controlled trials of younger patients (mean age ~57) with few, if any comorbidities, outpatient management with omission of antibiotics has become the recommendation for young patients with mild uncomplicated diverticulitis. However, this treatment strategy has not been evaluated in older or frail adults. As such, the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) and American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) guidelines recommend selected use of antibiotics in cases of uncomplicated diverticulitis in patients who are frail or have significant comorbidities. Close clinical follow‐up is essential in older adults, and antibiotics and/or inpatient observation should be considered in older, frail patients with systemic symptoms, fever, leukocytosis, multiple comorbidities, or unreliable follow‐up.
