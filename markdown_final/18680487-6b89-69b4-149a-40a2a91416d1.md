## Question

A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency department with sudden onset left-sided chest pain and mild shortness of breath. He is otherwise healthy, with no history of lung disease or smoking. On examination, he is alert and comfortable at rest. His vital signs are: respiratory rate 18/min, heart rate 88 bpm, blood pressure 124/76 mmHg, oxygen saturation 96% on room air. Chest auscultation reveals reduced breath sounds on the left side. A chest X-ray confirms a moderate left-sided pneumothorax. The patient is stable and the decision is made to observe him in hospital without immediate chest drain insertion.

According to the BTS guideline, what is the appropriate oxygen therapy for this patient during hospital observation, and what is the target oxygen saturation range?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate oxygen therapy and target oxygen saturation range for a 27-year-old man with a primary spontaneous pneumothorax who is being managed conservatively without immediate chest drainage, according to BTS guidance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and whether the patient is at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure. Then, I should verify the BTS-recommended oxygen delivery method and flow rate for pneumothorax under observation. Next, I will confirm the target oxygen saturation range and how it differs if hypercapnia risk is present. After that, I should review practical monitoring and titration steps, including when to obtain blood gases. Finally, I will consider any nuances or exceptions and synthesize a clear, actionable recommendation with citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk stratification. This is a young, otherwise healthy, non-smoker with a primary spontaneous pneumothorax and no known lung disease, which places him in the category of patients not at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure, so the standard oxygenation targets should apply rather than the lower range used for COPD or other ventilatory disorders [^113dDQtU] [^116MWJjq].

> Now, I should verify the specific oxygen delivery recommendation for pneumothorax managed conservatively. The BTS oxygen guideline advises administering high-concentration oxygen at 15 L/min via a reservoir (non-rebreather) mask for patients with pneumothorax under hospital observation without drainage, unless the patient is at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure, in which case a lower target and controlled oxygen are indicated [^111jWjxj] [^111Ru3N3] [^113dDQtU].

> Wait, let me verify the target saturation range. For most acutely ill adults not at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure, including pneumothorax, BTS recommends aiming for an oxygen saturation of 94–98%, and this applies here given his low risk profile and current stability on room air with SpO2 96% [^114G3eCH] [^116bZLBC] [^113dDQtU].

> Hold on, I should confirm monitoring and titration details so we don't over-oxygenate. Continuous pulse oximetry is appropriate in the acute setting, and oxygen should be titrated to keep saturations within the prescribed target range; if saturations rise above the target and the patient is stable, the flow should be reduced, and if saturations fall below the target, the delivery system or flow should be increased, with clinical reassessment for any deterioration [^116MWJjq] [^111jL5VM] [^113c7HR8].

> I need to check whether arterial blood gases are required in this scenario. In stable patients without risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure who are maintaining target saturations, repeat blood gases are not routinely required; however, if oxygen needs increase or the patient deteriorates, then blood gases and clinical review are indicated to reassess the course and exclude complications [^111jL5VM] [^113c7HR8].

> But wait, what if someone argues for a lower target range like 92–96% to avoid hyperoxia? Let me reconsider that. While some contemporary studies and systems have explored 92–96% as a standard range to reduce hyperoxia, the BTS 2017 guideline explicitly recommends 94–98% for most acutely ill adults not at risk of hypercapnia, including pneumothorax, so adhering to BTS guidance here supports 94–98% as the appropriate target in this patient [^114G3eCH] [^113dDQtU] [^112WshmM].

> Putting this together, I should double-check that the final recommendation aligns with both delivery and target. For this 27-year-old with a primary spontaneous pneumothorax under observation without drainage and no hypercapnia risk, the BTS-concordant approach is high-concentration oxygen at 15 L/min via a reservoir mask with a target oxygen saturation of 94–98%, titrated to stay within that range and adjusted based on continuous oximetry and clinical status [^111jWjxj] [^114G3eCH] [^116MWJjq].

---

Per BTS guidance, a stable 27-year-old with a moderate primary spontaneous pneumothorax should receive **high-concentration oxygen at 15 L/min via a reservoir mask** [^111jWjxj] during hospital observation, unless there is a risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure. The **target oxygen saturation is 94–98%** [^114G3eCH]; if the patient is at risk of hypercapnia, use a lower target of 88–92% [^115KgzJP] and monitor with blood gases. Oxygen should be titrated to maintain the target saturation, with regular reassessment of respiratory status and readiness for weaning [^113c7HR8].

## BTS-recommended oxygen therapy for pneumothorax

The BTS guideline recommends **high-concentration oxygen therapy** for patients with pneumothorax who are under hospital observation without drainage, unless they are at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure [^111jWjxj]. Specifically, the guideline advises administering oxygen at a flow rate of 15 L/min via a reservoir mask (non-rebreather mask) [^111Ru3N3]. This high-concentration oxygen therapy aims to increase the rate of pneumothorax resolution by accelerating the absorption of pleural air.

---

## Target oxygen saturation range

The BTS guideline recommends a **target oxygen saturation range of 94–98%** for most patients with pneumothorax who are not at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure [^114G3eCH]. This target range aligns with the general recommendation for acutely ill adults without hypercapnic risk [^113dDQtU]. For patients at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure (e.g. COPD, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, neuromuscular disease), a lower target saturation range of 88–92% is recommended [^115KgzJP], with careful monitoring of arterial blood gases to avoid carbon dioxide retention and respiratory acidosis [^111jL5VM].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting high-concentration oxygen therapy

Although direct randomized controlled trials specifically evaluating high-concentration oxygen therapy in adult pneumothorax are limited, the BTS recommendation is based on physiological principles and observational evidence suggesting that increasing the inspired oxygen concentration accelerates the absorption of pleural air. High-concentration oxygen therapy reduces the partial pressure of nitrogen in the pleural space, thereby **increasing the rate of nitrogen absorption** and facilitating pneumothorax resolution [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment of oxygen therapy

During oxygen therapy, the patient's oxygen saturation should be **monitored continuously or at frequent intervals** (e.g. every 4 hours) [^111jL5VM] to ensure that the target saturation range is maintained. If the oxygen saturation exceeds the upper limit of the target range (98%), the oxygen flow rate should be reduced to avoid hyperoxia-related complications [^113c7HR8]. Conversely, if the saturation falls below the lower limit (94%), the flow rate should be increased or the delivery device adjusted to achieve the target range [^113c7HR8].

---

## Potential risks and complications of high-concentration oxygen therapy

While high-concentration oxygen therapy is generally safe in patients without hypercapnic risk, potential risks include:

- **Oxygen toxicity**: Prolonged exposure to high concentrations of oxygen can cause oxidative stress and lung injury, although this is rare in short-term use.

- **Hyperoxia-induced hypercapnia**: In patients with underlying chronic respiratory conditions, excessive oxygen can suppress ventilatory drive, leading to carbon dioxide retention and respiratory acidosis [^112Uz73V].

- **Dry mucous membranes**: High-flow oxygen can cause dryness and discomfort, which can be mitigated by humidification if necessary.

---

## Weaning and discontinuation of oxygen therapy

Oxygen therapy should be gradually weaned once the patient stabilizes and the pneumothorax shows signs of resolution on serial chest radiographs. The weaning process involves **reducing the oxygen flow rate incrementally** while monitoring oxygen saturation and respiratory status [^113c7HR8]. Oxygen therapy can be discontinued once the patient maintains stable oxygen saturation within the target range while breathing room air and shows no signs of respiratory distress.

---

## Summary of BTS recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended oxygen therapy** | **Target oxygen saturation** |
|-|-|-|
| Pneumothorax under observation without drainage, no hypercapnic risk | High-concentration oxygen at 15 L/min via reservoir mask | 94–98% |
| Pneumothorax with hypercapnic risk (e.g. COPD, obesity hypoventilation syndrome) | Controlled oxygen therapy (e.g. Venturi mask at 24–28% or nasal cannula at 1–2 L/min) | 88–92% |

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

For a 27-year-old male with a moderate primary spontaneous pneumothorax under hospital observation without drainage, the BTS recommends **high-concentration oxygen therapy at 15 L/min via a reservoir mask** [^111jWjxj], with a target oxygen saturation range of 94–98% [^114G3eCH]. This approach aims to accelerate pneumothorax resolution while maintaining adequate oxygenation. Regular monitoring and titration of oxygen therapy are essential to ensure patient safety and optimal outcomes.

### Effect of a lower target oxygen saturation range on the risk of hypoxaemia and elevated NEWS2 scores at a university hospital: a retrospective study [^115PtRCN]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

In those observations made on patients at risk of hypercapnia who were prescribed the recommended target range of an SpO 2 between 88% and 92%, there was no difference in the proportion of observations with SpO 2 below range, < 88%, or markedly below range, < 85%. In patients for whom no target range was prescribed, there was an increase in the proportion of SpO 2 observations between 92% and 93% and a decrease in the proportions for SpO 2 between 97% and 98%. This is consistent with an institutional-level change in oxygen delivery practice.

The most desirable standard target range is the option that offers the safest profile of clinical risk in the condition for which it is prescribed. Hypoxaemia is given primary consideration on account of its well-described physiological effect and because severe hypoxaemia has a clear association with harm, ranging from transient compromise of cellular function to severe tissue ischaemia, organ dysfunction and death. The most common definition for hypoxaemia is an SpO 2 below 90%and when a 90% threshold was used, no clinically relevant difference in the risk of hypoxaemia between the two standard target ranges was observed. The current 2017 BTS-recommended standard saturation range of between 94% and 98% has been justified on the premise that this range more closely reflects normal SpO 2 values in a healthy population and a 4% margin of safety is warranted to account for variability in saturation levels; yet as reflected in the results of this trial, a margin of 2% may be sufficient.

### Chest pain evaluation: updated guidelines from the AHA / ACC… [^1158u1Hw]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

- In patients with known CAD, focus on controlling blood pressure and cholesterol. Consider CCTA to document CAD progression in patients with previous testing demonstrating nonobstructive lesions. From the AFP Editors. Initial Evaluation Chest pain can present as pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort in the chest, shoulders, arms, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw and less commonly as shortness of breath, nausea, or fatigue without pain. Chest pain is considered acute with new onset or if it involves a change in pattern, intensity, or duration; it is considered stable if it is chronic with unchanging triggers such as exertion or emotional stress. Initial evaluation should focus on ruling out life-threatening illnesses such as acute coronary syndrome, aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolism, which are often not indicated by pain severity. Response to nitroglycerin is not an accurate means of ruling in cardiac chest pain.

Patients with diabetes mellitus, women, and older patients more often present with associated nausea, fatigue, and shortness of breath. ACS should be considered when patients older than 75 years present with shortness of breath, syncope, mental impairment, or abdominal pain, or if they experience an unexplained fall. Diagnostic Evaluation Initial evaluation should involve 12-lead electrocardiography, which is recommended within 10 minutes of arrival in clinic and emergency settings. Because up to 6% of patients with cardiac ischemia are discharged from the emergency department after a single normal ECG, repeat testing should be considered in patients with normal ECG but a higher index of suspicion. Adding leads V7 to V9 should be considered on repeat testing to assess for posterior wall ischemia. ST elevation, hyperacute T waves, left bundle branch block, and ST depression are the most concerning findings for cardiac chest pain.

Physical examination can sometimes demonstrate life-threatening causes of chest pain, including diaphoresis and tachypnea suggesting ACS, tachycardia and dyspnea suggesting pulmonary embolism, and subcutaneous emphysema suggesting esophageal rupture. Chest tenderness on palpation or pain with inspiration suggests a noncardiac etiology. Nonischemic Chest Pain Immediate echocardiography should be used in patients with suspected nonischemic causes of chest pain such as aortic dissection, pericardial effusion, and pulmonary embolism. If echocardiography rules out life-threatening injury, computed tomography or cardiovascular MRI can be used to confirm a suspected diagnosis.

Good practice points related to administration of oxygen therapy
✓ For hypoxaemic patients, oxygen therapy should continue during other treatments such as nebulised therapy. Clinicians should assess the clinical status of the patient prior to prescribing oxygen and the patient's condition should be reassessed frequently during oxygen use (see recommendations B1–B3).
✓ The administering healthcare professional should note the oxygen saturation before starting oxygen therapy wherever possible but never discontinue or delay oxygen therapy for seriously ill patients (see recommendation B2).
✓ The healthcare professional should start oxygen therapy using an appropriate delivery system and flow rate as specified in sections 8–10 of this guideline. The target oxygen saturation should be documented on the respiratory section of the observation chart.
✓ Whenever possible, patients should be given an oxygen information sheet (example in web appendix 6 on the BTS website).
✓ Staff should check the oxygen supply and connections on a regular basis because there have been serious incidents due to disconnection or misconnection of oxygen supplies.
✓ Staff must ensure that adequate oxygen is provided during transfers and while patients are in diagnostic departments. Additionally, oxygen saturation should be monitored continuously for seriously ill patients who require escorted transfers. This is because there have been serious incidents involving accidental discontinuation of oxygen or cylinders running out during interward transfers or transfers to other departments such as for X-rays.

Baseline measurement

The initial Trust baseline measurement was undertaken in 2010 by junior doctors working within the respiratory department under the supervision of two senior consultants. Data was collected using the BTS emergency oxygen audit data collection form during an eight-week period and returned to the BTS for analysis; all eligible patients were included to minimise selection bias. Results were returned at local (hospital) and national level.

In 2010, oxygen use in the Trust was 13% compared to 15% nationally. Baseline data for each of the four standards is presented below (national data):

Valid oxygen prescription: 55% (56%)?
Documented target saturation range: 50% (44%)?
Oxygen saturations documented at observations rounds: 84% (99%)

### Clinical evaluation… [^111nTTLT]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical Evaluation Symptoms of acute coronary syndrome include chest pain, referred pain, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, diaphoresis, and light-headedness. Some patients may present without chest pain; in one review, 2 sudden dyspnea was the sole presenting feature in 4 to 14 percent of patients with acute myocardial infarction. Pain may be referred to either arm, the jaw, the neck, the back, or even the abdomen. Pain radiating to the shoulder, left arm, or both arms somewhat increases the likelihood of acute coronary syndrome.
3. Typical angina is described as pain that is substernal, occurs on exertion, and is relieved with rest. Patients with all three of these features have a greater likelihood of having acute coronary syndrome than patients with none, one, or even two of these features.

Chest pain that occurs suddenly at rest or in a young patient may suggest acute coronary vasospasm, which occurs in Prinzmetal's angina or with the use of cocaine or methamphetamine. Only about 2 percent of patients with cocaine-associated chest pain have acute coronary syndrome. The physical examination in patients with acute coronary syndrome frequently is normal. Ominous physical findings include a new mitral regurgitation murmur, hypotension, pulmonary rales, a new third heart sound, and new jugular venous distention. Chest-wall tenderness reduces the likelihood of acute coronary syndrome.
3. Any patient with a history suggestive of acute coronary syndrome should be evaluated in a facility that has ECG and cardiac monitoring equipment. 7 Patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome who have chest pain at rest for more than 20 minutes, syncope/presyncope, or unstable vital signs should be referred to an emergency department immediately.

7 The diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, which includes both STEMI and NSTEMI, requires at least two of the following: ischemic symptoms, diagnostic ECG changes, and serum cardiac marker elevation. 8, 9. A suggested approach to the evaluation of patients with chest pain or symptoms consistent with acute coronary syndrome is provided in Figure

1. When a patient presents with chest pain or symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome, vital signs should be obtained, the patient should be monitored, and a focused but careful history should be obtained. A 12-lead ECG should be obtained within 10 minutes of presentation. 7.

### Pneumothorax management: current state of practice in the UK [^115YAopv]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Whilst there has always been allowance for individual clinician preference in guidelines, there needs to be consensus on the optimum management strategy. The challenge the new guidelines face is to design a simple and pragmatic approach, using this new evidence base. It may be that a more personalised, stratified approach to treatment decision-making in PSP could minimise this variation, but as yet, there are no good predictors of early treatment failure. Failure of medical management (i.e. ongoing air leak at Day 4) may be predicted by digital airflow measurement but whether this can be translated into a new clinical pathway needs to be confirmed in an RCT. Further data and the updated ERS and BTS guidelines are eagerly awaited. The real test, however, will be in the future education and implementation.

### Oxygen delivery on medical wards [^115GbFiJ]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This project has highlighted that we are struggling to meet the guidelines set out by the BTS on oxygen prescribing. The benefits of adhering to these are twofold. Firstly, it is important for patient safety to ensure patients have the appropriate oxygen delivered to them. Secondly, more diligent use of oxygen should result in a shorter time patients are on oxygen and in theory reduce the length of stay for patients. The current system is failing because of the lack of linking the observation of saturations to the thought to reduce oxygen supply. The main factor involved with this is the general perception that if saturations are high then no further action is required.

Use of electronic observation charts should allow the use patient specific saturation targets which will also then allow for escalation of their early warning score and hopefully prompt action. This will be explored and if feasible will hopefully result in a greater improvement. This should result in a direct response as if someone's early warning score is increased when saturations are outside the target range, this is difficult to ignore.

### A new oxygen prescription produces real improvements in therapeutic oxygen use [^112qREYW]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

Oxygen is a treatment for hypoxaemia and its safe and effective use is set out in national guidelines devised by the BTS and implemented in 2008. The guideline can be summarised as "a requirement for oxygen to be prescribed according to a target saturation range and for those who administer oxygen therapy to monitor the patient and keep within the target saturation range".

A key objective of the BTS was to audit oxygen use in the UK before implementation of the guidelines, and annually thereafter. Four standards, each with a target of 100%, were identified:

Unless in emergency for the critically ill patient, when its use should be documented after administration, oxygen should be prescribed on a designated drug chart or oxygen order
The prescription should include a documented target saturation range of 94–98% for most acutely ill patients or 88–92% for those at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure
Oxygen saturation should be documented on the patient's observations chart at each observations round
Oxygen should be signed for on the drug chart on each drug round

The results of the BTS audits in 2008 (prior to implementation of the guideline) and 2010 (after implementation) demonstrated that the number of patients using oxygen fell from 17.5% to 15.5%, whilst the number with a prescription rose from 32% to 56%. Of those with a prescription, only 10% had a documented target range in 2008, rising to 41% by 2010. Documentation of oximetry on observation charts was 94% in 2008 and improved to 99% in 2010. Oxygen was rarely signed for at drug rounds, rising from 5% in 2008 to 16% in 2010.

Despite the above modest improvements, the authors of these studies noted that difficulty in changing established practice was the main reason that more rapid improvements in oxygen use were not observed. Several explanations for this were suggested including poor quality oxygen prescription and bedside observation charts, and inadequate training of healthcare professionals.

### Determination of oxygen saturation compared to a prescribed target range using continuous pulse oximetry in acutely unwell medical patients [^115grmBo]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Oxygen is a commonly administered drug in hospital. Despite the therapeutic use of oxygen for over 100 years, to our knowledge the first guideline to be published addressing the use of oxygen in the acute care setting was the 2008 British Thoracic Society (BTS) guideline for emergency oxygen use in adults. This guideline was the first to clearly state that oxygen should be administered as a treatment for hypoxaemia and should not be administered indiscriminately to all acutely unwell patients or as a universal treatment for breathlessness. Specifically, the most recent BTS guideline recommends the titration of oxygen to achieve a target peripheral oxygen saturation of 94–98%, with a lower target saturation range of 88–92% in patients at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure. The Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand (TSANZ) recommend a target range of 92–96% in patients without risk factors for hypercapnic respiratory failure, and the same 88–92% range in patients at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure. These recommendations are supported by evidence for harm relating to the administration of excessive concentrations of oxygen in acute illnesses, particularly in patients at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure, as well as the known association between hypoxaemia and mortality.

Despite strong evidence to support the avoidance of over and under-oxygenation, detailed information to determine whether this is being achieved in current clinical practice is limited. The 2015 BTS national emergency oxygen audit demonstrated only 69% of patients receiving oxygen had SpO 2 within a prescribed range when evaluated at a single timepoint and a 2017 Australian audit demonstrated SpO 2 matched a prescribed range in 61% of patients admitted to an Acute Medical Unit. However, these studies were limited by either single timepoint evaluation of SpO 2 or evaluation according to intermittent SpO 2 measurements by nursing staff. To our knowledge, there are no studies using continuous SpO 2 monitoring, investigating the proportion of time patients spend with SpO 2 within a prescribed target range and the time-exposure to oxygen saturation above and below range. This is important in order to understand the risk associated with oxygen therapy in current clinical practice and how this risk can be reduced.

We therefore conducted a non-interventional two-centre study using continuous oximetry for a period of 24 h to determine SpO 2 compared to a prescribed target range in acutely unwell medical patients, and investigated which factors influenced the time spent in target range. Our hypothesis was that care in a high-dependency area, more frequent adjustments to oxygen delivery and prescription of a reduced hypercapnic target range would be associated with a greater proportion of time in range.

### S (p) O (2) values in acute medical admissions breathing air – implications for the British thoracic society guideline for emergency oxygen use in adult patients? [^113Jwhfe]. Resuscitation (2012). Low credibility.

S(p)O(2) is routinely used to assess the well-being of patients, but it is difficult to find an evidence-based description of its normal range. The British Thoracic Society (BTS) has published guidance for oxygen administration and recommends a target S(p)O(2) of 94–98% for most adult patients. These recommendations rely on consensus opinion and small studies using arterial blood gas measurements of saturation (S(a)O(2)). Using large datasets of routinely collected vital signs from four hospitals, we analysed the S(p)O(2) range of 37,593 acute general medical inpatients (males: 47%) observed to be breathing room air. Age at admission ranged from 16 to 105 years with a mean (SD) of 64 (21) years. 19,642 admissions (52%) were aged < 70 years. S(p)O(2) ranged from 70% to 100% with a median (IQR) of 97% (95–98%). S(p)O(2) values for males and females were similar. In-hospital mortality for the study patients was 5.27% (range 4.80–6.27%). Mortality (95% CI) for patients with initial S(p)O(2) values of 97%, 96% and 95% was 3.65% (3.22–4.13); 4.47% (3.99–5.00); and 5.67% (5.03–6.38), respectively. Additional analyses of S(p)O(2) values for 37,299 medical admissions aged ≥ 18 years provided results that were distinctly different to those upon which the current BTS guidelines based their definition of normality. Our findings suggest that the BTS should consider changing its target saturation for actively treated patients not at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure to 96–98%.

### A new oxygen prescription produces real improvements in therapeutic oxygen use [^117VrtZE]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Medical Oxygen is a drug. The BTS requires that oxygen be prescribed according to a target saturation range and for those who administer oxygen therapy to monitor the patient and keep within the target saturation range.

The 2014 QIP was devised following the recognition that oxygen use within the Trust did not meet required national standards. Over several PDSA cycles, carried out between 2012 and 2014, we implemented several new interventions that resulted in substantial improvements in the use of medical oxygen therapy. The negative impact of poor oxygen therapy is likely to have reduced as a result of these improvements however it is not possible to quantify this effect directly. Although not the main aim of this QIP, it is estimated that these results equate to an annual financial saving of £30,400.

The 2014 QIP demonstrates the importance of creating interventions that produce sustained results. It also highlights the importance of targeting all healthcare professionals involved in medical oxygen therapy and not individual groups such as doctors. A further cycle of audit in 2015 will provide data about the impact of the new oxygen prescription chart. The results of this audit will identify where further improvements can be made.

### Effect of a lower target oxygen saturation range on the risk of hypoxaemia and elevated NEWS2 scores at a university hospital: a retrospective study [^112WshmM]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Oxygen therapy is common in hospital settings. Clinical guidelines recommend that oxygen is prescribed and delivered to achieve a particular oxygen saturation (SpO 2) target range. The prescribed target range defines SpO 2 values that minimise clinical risks to patients with hypoxaemia, when saturation falls below rangeor hyperoxaemia, when saturation rises above range. Oxygen guidelines broadly align with advocating the use of two possible target ranges. First, a low target range prescribed for those at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure. Second, a standard target range for those who are not at such risk. There is consensus that the low target range should be an SpO 2 between 88% and 92%. There is less consensus about an appropriate standard range. The 2017 British Thoracic Society (BTS) and 2022 American Association for Respiratory Care guidelines recommend a standard SpO 2 target range of 94–98%, whereas the 2015 Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand (TSANZ) and 2022 German National S3 guidelines recommend a target range of 92–96%. The evidence suggesting a reduced clinical risk for the lower compared with higher standard target rangehas led to a strong recommendation for maintaining SpO 2 of no more than 96% in acutely ill medical patients on supplemental oxygen. Additionally, with oxygen conservation given increased priority during the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 UK National Health Service (NHS) recommendation was for a standard target range of 92–96% for all hospital patients; while the 2020 WHO guidance was to target > 94% during resuscitation, followed by > 90% in non-pregnant adults with COVID-19 once stable.

Measurement of SpO 2 with pulse oximeters guides oxygen titration and safe oxygen delivery, but also contributes directly to assessment of physiological derangement and the risk of adverse patient outcomes. Consequently, SpO 2 has been widely adopted as a 'vital sign' and integrated into early warning scores (EWSs) that are used to standardise the assessment and responses to acute illness. Composite EWSs also include measurements of respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, temperature and level of consciousness, in addition to SpO 2 and supplemental oxygen use, and accurately predict important adverse outcomes, including in-hospital cardiac arrestand death. The National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) is widely used in NHS trusts. It was revised in 2017 to distinguish between the low (88–92%) and standard (94–98%) SpO 2 target ranges.

Good practice points related to oxygen use in perioperative care
✓ A target saturation of 94–98% is recommended for most surgical patients except those at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure when a range of 88–92% should be achieved.
✓ Pulse oximetry monitoring is recommended for postoperative patients despite the lack of evidence from randomised studies.
✓ Patients using patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) should have two-hourly oximetry observations because of the risk of hypoxaemia. Oxygen should be administered to keep patients within the appropriate target saturation range.
✓ A target saturation of 94–98% is advised in most patients having PCA except those at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure when a range of 88–92% should be achieved.
✓ There is conflicting evidence concerning the balance of potential benefits and risks of perioperative hyperoxaemia to reduce the risk of surgical site infection in elective surgery and there is no evidence for this practice in patients having emergency surgical procedures. More trials are required for specific procedures, and more information is required concerning long-term mortality risks to patients with cancer. In the meantime, oxygen should not be used for this indication outside of clinical trials.

U. Weaning and discontinuation of oxygen therapy
U1. Lower the oxygen concentration if the patient is clinically stable and the oxygen saturation is above the target range or if it has been in the upper zone of the target range for some time (usually 4–8 hours) (grade D).
U2. If the target saturation is maintained, the new delivery system and flow should be continued. Repeat blood gas measurements are not required. If the patient is stable, the process can be repeated and the patient can eventually be weaned off oxygen (see section 12) (grade D).
U3. Most stable convalescent patients will eventually be stepped down to 2 L/min via nasal cannulae prior to cessation of oxygen therapy. Patients at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure may be stepped down to 1 L/min (or occasionally 0.5 L/min) via nasal cannulae or a 24% Venturi mask at 2 L/min as the lowest oxygen concentration prior to cessation of oxygen therapy (grade D).
U4. Oxygen therapy should be stopped once a patient is clinically stable on low-concentration oxygen, and the oxygen saturation is within the desired range on two consecutive observations (but the prescription for a target saturation range should remain active in case of future deterioration). It may be appropriate to alter the target range following senior review in patients with chronic cardiopulmonary disease who either have saturations < 94% when stable or in whom it is deemed sensible to discharge from hospital with saturations < 94% pending an outpatient oxygen assessment. Oxygen should also be stopped if the patient has come to the end of a written protocol of timed oxygen (eg, postoperatively) (grade D).
U5. Oxygen saturation on air should be monitored for 5 min after stopping oxygen therapy. If it remains in the desired range, it should be rechecked at 1 hour (grade D).
U6. If the oxygen saturation and physiological 'track and trigger' score (eg, NEWS) is satisfactory at 1 hour, the patient has safely discontinued oxygen therapy. However, saturation and physiology should continue to be monitored on a regular basis according to the patient's underlying clinical condition (grade D).
U7. If the saturation falls below the patient's target range on stopping oxygen therapy, restart the lowest concentration that maintained the patient in the target range and monitor for 5 min. If this restores the saturation into the target range, continue oxygen therapy at this level and attempt discontinuation of oxygen therapy again at a later date provided the patient remains clinically stable (grade D).
U8. If a patient requires oxygen therapy to be restarted at a higher concentration than before to maintain the same target saturation range, the patient should have a clinical review to establish the cause for this deterioration (grade D).
U9. Some patients may have episodic hypoxaemia (eg, after minor exertion or due to mucus plugging) after they have safely discontinued oxygen therapy. An on-going prescription for a target saturation range will allow these patients to receive oxygen as the need arises but transient asymptomatic desaturation does not require correction (grade D).

### Oxygen-saturation targets for critically ill adults receiving mechanical ventilation [^112ChXUm]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

Invasive mechanical ventilation in critically ill adults involves adjusting the fraction of inspired oxygen to maintain arterial oxygen saturation. The oxygen-saturation target that will optimize clinical outcomes in this patient population remains unknown.

Methods

In a pragmatic, cluster-randomized, cluster-crossover trial conducted in the emergency department and medical intensive care unit at an academic center, we assigned adults who were receiving mechanical ventilation to a lower target for oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry (Spo 2) (90%; goal range, 88 to 92%), an intermediate target (94%; goal range, 92 to 96%), or a higher target (98%; goal range, 96 to 100%). The primary outcome was the number of days alive and free of mechanical ventilation (ventilator-free days) through day 28. The secondary outcome was death by day 28, with data censored at hospital discharge.

Results

A total of 2541 patients were included in the primary analysis. The median number of ventilator-free days was 20 (interquartile range, 0 to 25) in the lower-target group, 21 (interquartile range, 0 to 25) in the intermediate-target group, and 21 (interquartile range, 0 to 26) in the higher-target group (P = 0.81). In-hospital death by day 28 occurred in 281 of the 808 patients (34.8%) in the lower-target group, 292 of the 859 patients (34.0%) in the intermediate-target group, and 290 of the 874 patients (33.2%) in the higher-target group. The incidences of cardiac arrest, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, stroke, and pneumothorax were similar in the three groups.

Conclusions

Among critically ill adults receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, the number of ventilator-free days did not differ among groups in which a lower, intermediate, or higher Spo 2 target was used.

### BTS clinical statement on air travel for passengers with respiratory disease [^1157966N]. Thorax (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice points

In patients with comorbidity, including PH and/or cardiovascular disease, attention should also be paid to the impact of air travel on these conditions.
Physicians may wish to consider HCT in those whom SpO2 falls to < 95% on exercise, and/or in those in whom either TLCO ≤ 50% or PaO 2 ≤ 9.42 kPa (if available).
Patients with TLco < 50% of predicted or PaO 2 ≤ 9.42 kPa are likely to need in-flight oxygen. If there are no concerns about hypercapnia it may be reasonable to recommend 2 L/min without recourse to HCT. In those in whom there are concerns about CO2 retention, titration HCT is advised to determine the oxygen flow rate.

Thoracic surgery and other interventional procedures

There is no high-quality evidence in this area and further research and/or data collection are needed. The following are suggested time periods before which a medically unaccompanied commercial flight can safely be undertaken after the specific thoracic interventions described below. The advice is conservative. Shorter recovery periods may be appropriate in individual cases, but only if approved by the doctor/surgeon carrying out the procedure. It is also important to note that the potential risks of travel are not just those associated with a postprocedure pneumothorax, but include wound infection and pain, which could require medical attention at destination and would need approval by the travel insurer.

Thoracic surgery, including VATS procedures

In the absence of published evidence, we advocate a conservative and safe minimum time interval, with the caveat that flying sooner after such procedures may be possible and/or desirable, but that this should be agreed with the surgeon and discussed with the airline. At least two UK centres independently advise against non-essential air travel for 4 weeks after removal of drains (Jon Naylor, personal communication). If air travel is essential, a minimum delay of 2 weeks is advised, depending on the type of surgery and the surgeon's advice.

Clinical practice points

The opinion of the surgeon or interventionalist should be obtained before the patient travels by air. Patients, professionals, and their carers should be aware that this may result in a delay of 4 weeks for non-essential air travel and 2 weeks for essential air travel.
Careful clinical assessment of the patient is required. This should include consideration of their baseline status including comorbidities, SpO2, postprocedure complications such as infection and/or pain, flight duration and destination.

### Initiative to improve oxygen prescribing and oxygen delivery to patients in the emergency department of a national referral hospital [^114ZfEj2]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Current state

Our emergency department (ED) does not have proper guidelines about oxygen prescription regarding what a doctor should write when prescribing oxygen therapy, what a nurse should document and what the patient's target is. We assessed the prescription of oxygen categorically in the following main areas: (1) physician prescription according to BTS guidelines, (2) nursing note after physician order and (3) evaluation of patients at bedside if they are receiving oxygen based on the BTS guidelines. A baseline survey done in our ED for a period of 2 weeks showed that only 20% of the physician prescriptions and 22% of nurses' notes are complete, where one or more components were missing in the rest of the sheets. The survey also showed that only 34% of the patients were receiving oxygen consistent with target saturation at a correct flow rate with proper oxygen devices based on the BTS guidelines.

### British thoracic society guideline for oxygen use in adults in healthcare and emergency settings [^116MWJjq]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2017). Medium credibility.

Philosophy of the guideline

✓ Oxygen is a treatment for hypoxaemia, not breathlessness. Oxygen has not been proven to have any consistent effect on the sensation of breathlessness in non-hypoxaemic patients.
✓ The essence of this guideline can be summarised simply as a requirement for oxygen to be prescribed according to a target saturation range and for those who administer oxygen therapy to monitor the patient and keep within the target saturation range.
✓ The guideline recommends aiming to achieve normal or near-normal oxygen saturation for all acutely ill patients apart from those at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure or those receiving terminal palliative care.

Assessing patients For critically ill patients, high concentration oxygen should be administered immediately (table 1 and figure 1) and this should be recorded afterwards in the patient's health record. Clinicians must bear in mind that supplemental oxygen is given to improve oxygenation, but it does not treat the underlying causes of hypoxaemia which must be diagnosed and treated as a matter of urgency. The oxygen saturation should be checked by pulse oximetry in all breathless and acutely ill patients, 'the fifth vital sign' (supplemented by blood gases when necessary), and the inspired oxygen concentration should be recorded on the observation chart with the oximetry result. (The other vital signs are pulse rate, blood pressure, temperature and respiratory rate). Pulse oximetry must be available in all locations where emergency oxygen is used. Clinical assessment is recommended if the saturation falls by ≥ 3% or below the target range for the patient. All critically ill patients outside of a critical care area (e.g. intensive care unit (ICU), high dependency unit (HDU), respiratory HDU), should be assessed and monitored using a recognised physiological track and trigger system such as the National Early Warning Score (NEWS).
Target Oxygen prescription Oxygen should be prescribed to achieve a target saturation of 94–98% for most acutely ill patients or 88–92% or patient-specific target range for those at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure (tables 1–4). Best practice is to prescribe a target range for all hospital patients at the time of admission so that appropriate oxygen therapy can be started in the event of unexpected clinical deterioration with hypoxaemia and also to ensure that the oximetry section of the early warning score (EWS) can be scored appropriately. The target saturation should be written (or ringed) on the drug chart or entered in an electronic prescribing system (guidance on figure 1).
Oxygen administration Oxygen should be administered by staff who are trained in oxygen administration. These staff should use appropriate devices and flow rates in order to achieve the target saturation range (figure 2). Staff should be trained in the use of a range of different oxygen delivery devices to ensure oxygen is delivered safely.
Monitoring and maintenance of target saturation Oxygen saturation and delivery system (including flow rate) should be recorded on the patient's monitoring chart. Oxygen delivery devices and flow rates should be adjusted to keep the oxygen saturation in the target range. Prompt clinical assessment is required if oxygen therapy needs to be initiated or increased due to a falling saturation level. Oxygen should be prescribed and a signature should be entered on the drug chart on each drug round.
Weaning and discontinuation of oxygen therapy Oxygen should be reduced in stable patients with satisfactory oxygen saturation. Oxygen should be discontinued once the patient can maintain saturation within or above the target range breathing air but the prescription for a target range should be left in place in case of future deterioration and to guide early warning scores (EWS/NEWS).

### Initiative to improve oxygen prescribing and oxygen delivery to patients in the emergency department of a national referral hospital [^114wfrDo]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Background

The BTS guideline states that all patients requiring oxygen must have valid orders on admission and target saturations must be stipulated on the prescription chart. Audits of oxygen use and oxygen prescription have shown consistently poor performance in many countries, and most clinicians who deal with medical emergencies have encountered adverse incidents and occasional deaths due to underuse and overuse of oxygen.

Rose et al in their project showed that 25% of patients receiving oxygen did not have any prescription order and 75% with order were only via verbal orders, and most were incomplete as per the BTS guidelines. A project done in India showed that though 50% of audited charts had written prescriptions, only 1.4% were completed and valid. Martin et al in their quality improvement project (QIP) saw a baseline review that only 23% of the charts had oxygen prescriptions. To effectively provide appropriate oxygen to the patients, three components should be present: complete oxygen order from a doctor, nurses' inpatient chart and the delivered oxygen to the patient is consistent with the order. Based on BTS guidelines, a doctor's oxygen prescription should document the indication for starting oxygen, target range, device and flow rate, and any change in the prescription should also be documented. Similarly, the nurse's charting should copy the target saturation, device and the flow rate of oxygen. At the end, the patient should be assessed whether the correct oxygen is being delivered as per the note.

A QIP done elsewhere had shown that incomplete oxygen prescription and inappropriate oxygen delivery are consistent when prescribers are not aware of the guidelines about oxygen therapy, there is a communication gap between nurses and doctors and lack of proper monitoring of oxygen therapy. From the available literature, it is clear that oxygen therapy prescription is a universal issue, and several audits and QIPs have been performed to identify the areas of non-compliance and improve the prescription safely. We also found similar compliance issues as seen in other projects.

However, several quality improvements (QI) done have introduced BTS guidelines and educated health professionals as an intervention in their Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle, which have improved oxygen prescription. A QIP done in the UK showed oxygen prescription improved from initial 58% to 86% and patients receiving the correct range of oxygen saturation improved from 69% to 100% by the end of the 4-year clinical audit.

For acute exacerbations on board, the passenger's own bronchodilator inhaler should be given, with a spacer if appropriate.
Passengers with severe COPD are advised to carry a copy of their COPD management plan and/or relevant clinic letters. This information can be held securely as scanned copies on their mobile phone A history of previous pneumothorax or bullous lung disease necessitates assessment by a respiratory specialist to determine the potential risk of complications from reduced cabin pressure.
Patients with COPD are at greater risk of VTE as a direct consequence of the underlying condition, as well as after an exacerbation. They should be advised accordingly, especially if planning longer flights when the risk is further enhanced.
Patients requiring long-term oxygen therapy should also plan for oxygen supplementation at their destination (see online supplemental appendix 1).
Wherever possible, those who have had a recent exacerbation of their condition should not fly until their condition is stable and use of reliever therapy has returned to their usual baseline. If their condition deteriorates while overseas, medical advice should be sought before undertaking the return flight.

Cystic fibrosis

All medications and spacer devices should be carried in hand luggage to mitigate the risk of missing hold baggage.
Patients with CF under the age of 6 are likely to be well enough to fly at the paediatrician's discretion.
In those with CF who are old enough for spirometry and whose FEV1 is < 50% predicted, HCT is recommended. If SpO2 falls below the 90% cut-off, as outlined above, in-flight oxygen is advised.
In children with chronic lung disease able to perform spirometry whose FEV 1 is consistently < 50% predicted, HCT should be considered. This includes children with CF and non-CF bronchiectasis. Children with chronic lung disease who are too young to reliably perform spirometry should have a clinical assessment of assess disease severity and their likely tolerance of hypoxia. For children with CF disease is rarely severe enough to severely compromise lung function at this age.

### British thoracic society guideline for oxygen use in adults in healthcare and emergency settings [^116QAGsU]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2017). Medium credibility.

Against this background, the Standards of Care Committee of the British Thoracic Society (BTS) established a working party in association with 21 other societies to produce an evidence-based guideline for emergency oxygen use in the UK. This led to the production of the 2008 BTS Guideline for emergency oxygen use in adult patients which was the world's first guideline for emergency oxygen therapy. This guideline has been implemented throughout the UK and in many other countries leading to over 500 citations in the medical literature up to the end of 2016.

The purpose of the update to the 2008 guideline is to strengthen the evidence base of the previous guideline based on revised methodology (which meets criteria contained in the AGREE II Instrument) and to extend the evidence base to the end of 2013. Additionally, the remit of the 2008 Guideline has been broadened to cover several new aspects of oxygen use and a broader range of locations where oxygen might be used.

Intended users of the guideline and target patient populations

This guideline is mainly intended for use by all healthcare professionals who may be involved in emergency oxygen use. This will include ambulance staff, first responders, paramedics, doctors, nurses, midwives, physiotherapists, pharmacists and all other healthcare professionals who may deal with ill or breathless patients. Advice is also provided for first responders belonging to voluntary organisations or other non-NHS bodies. Information based on this guideline is available on the BTS website for use in the following situations:
Hospital use.
Primary care use.
Ambulance use (supplemented by Ambulance service guidance based on this guideline).
Use by nursing staff and allied health professions.

These abbreviated versions of the guideline contain the key recommendations and tables and charts that are relevant to the particular situation.

Areas covered by this guideline

The guideline addresses the use of oxygen in three main categories of adult patients in the prehospital and hospital setting and in other settings such as palliative care:
Critically ill or hypoxaemic patients.
Hypoxaemic patients and patients at risk of hypoxaemia.
Non-hypoxaemic patients who may benefit from oxygen (eg, carbon monoxide poisoning).

### BTS clinical statement on air travel for passengers with respiratory disease [^114jPhmi]. Thorax (2022). Medium credibility.

Non-CF bronchiectasis

Regular airway clearance is essential for those dealing with overproduction of mucus.
Advice from a respiratory physiotherapist on adapting airway clearance techniques should be sought for long-haul flights.
Portable nebulisers and positive expiratory pressure (PEP) devices may be considered, but use of these devices in-flight must be approved by the airline before travel.

Interstitial lung disease

In patients with comorbidity, including PH and/ or cardiovascular disease, attention should also be paid to the impact of air travel on these conditions.
Physicians may wish to consider HCT in those whom SpO2 falls to < 95% on exercise, and/or in those in whom either Transfer Factor Carbon Monoxide (TLCO) ≤ 50% or PaO 2 ≤ 9.42 kPa (if available).
Patients with TLCO < 50% of predicted or PaO 2 ≤ 9.42 kPa are likely to need in-flight oxygen. If there are no concerns about hypercapnia it may be reasonable to recommend 2 L/min without recourse to HCT. In those in whom there are concerns about CO2 retention, titration HCT is advised to determine the oxygen flow rate.

Thoracic surgery

The opinion of the surgeon or interventionalist should be obtained before the patient travels by air. Patients, professionals and their carers should be aware that this may result in a delay of 4 weeks for non-essential air travel and 2 weeks for essential air travel.
Careful clinical assessment of the patient is required. This should include consideration of their baseline status including comorbidities, SpO2, postprocedure complications such as infection and/or pain, flight duration and destination.

Other interventional procedures

The opinion of the interventionalist should be obtained before the patient travels by air.
Careful clinical assessment of the patient is required. This should include consideration of baseline status including co-morbidities, SpO2, postprocedure complications such as infection or pain, flight duration and destination.
Patients with no pneumothorax seen on the postprocedure chest X-ray should wait for 1 week before air travel.
Patients with a pneumothorax seen on the post-procedure chest X-ray should wait for one1 week after resolution on chest X-ray before air travel.

Trapped lung

The opinion of the interventionalist should be obtained before the patient travels by air.
Patients should be assessed carefully and advised on a case-by-case basis.
Patients should be clinically stable before air travel.

W. Practical aspects of oxygen dispensing, documentation and monitoring
W1. Registered nurses and others who dispense drugs in hospitals should sign the drug chart or electronic prescribing record at every drug round and check that the patient is receiving oxygen therapy. This is to check that the patient is within the target saturation and also to check whether weaning and discontinuation should be instituted (grade D).
W2. Most patients are prescribed an oxygen target range. If patients are on air at the time of the drug round, registered nurses should sign the drug chart using a code such as 'A' for air and the observation chart should also be filled in using the code A for air (see table 5 and figure 19 in the full guideline) (grade D).
W3. All patients should have their oxygen saturation observed for at least 5 min after starting oxygen therapy or for patients who require an increased concentration of oxygen and after oxygen therapy has been decreased or stopped (grade D).
W4. If the oxygen saturation is above the target saturation range and the patient is stable, the delivery system or oxygen flow rate should be modified to return the saturation to within the target range (grade D).
W5. Patients who have a target saturation of 88–92% should have their blood gases measured within 30–60 min. This is to ensure that the carbon dioxide level is not rising. This recommendation also applies to those who are at risk of developing hypercapnic respiratory failure but who have a normal PCO 2 on the initial blood gas measurement (grade D).
W6. Stable patients whose oxygen saturation is within their target saturation range of 94–98% do not need repeat blood gas measurements within 30–60 min if there is no risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure and acidosis and may not need any further blood gas measurements unless there should be further deterioration including symptoms or signs of possible hypercapnia (grade D).
W7. Stable patients on oxygen treatment should have SpO 2 and physiological variables (eg, NEWS) measured four times a day (grade D).
W8. In those who have signs of critical illness (eg, NEWS score 7 or above), oxygen saturation should be monitored continuously and the patient may require level 2 or level 3 care on a high-dependency unit or critical care unit (grade D).
W9. If the patient is clinically stable and the oxygen saturation is within the target range, treatment should be continued (or eventually lowered) depending on the clinical situation (grade D).
W10. Oxygen therapy should be increased if the saturation is below the desired range and decreased if the saturation is above the desired range (and eventually discontinued as the patient recovers) (grade D).
W11. The new saturation (and the new delivery system) and flow rate should be recorded on the patient's observation chart after 5 min of treatment at the new oxygen concentration. Each change should be recorded by the clinician trained to administer oxygen by signing the observation chart (only changes should be signed for) (grade D).
W12. Repeat blood gas measurements are not required for stable patients who require a reduced concentration of oxygen (or cessation of oxygen therapy) to maintain the desired target saturation (grade D).
W13. Patients with no risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure do not always need repeat blood gas measurements after an increase in oxygen concentration. However, the patient requires clinical review to determine why the oxygen saturation has fallen (grade D).
W14. Patients at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure (usually those with a target range of 88–92%; see table 4) require repeat blood gas assessment 30–60 min after an increase in oxygen therapy (to ensure that the carbon dioxide level is not rising) (grade D).
W15. For patients with no risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure, monitoring by pulse oximeter is sufficient (repeated blood gases not required) provided the patient is clinically stable and the oxygen saturation remains in the desired range, usually 94–98% (grade D).
W16. If a patient's oxygen saturation is lower than the prescribed target range, first check all aspects of the oxygen delivery system and the oximeter device for faults or errors (grade D).
W17. If a patient's oxygen saturation is consistently lower than the prescribed target range, there should be a medical review and the oxygen therapy should be increased according to an agreed written protocol (grade D).
W18. If the oxygen saturation fails to rise following 5–10 min of increased oxygen therapy or if there is clinical concern following medical review, then blood gas measurements should be repeated (grade D).

Good practice point

Management of hypercapnia or respiratory acidosis due to excessive oxygen therapy (avoidance of life-threatening rebound hypoxaemia):
✓ If a patient is suspected to have hypercapnic or respiratory failure due to excessive oxygen therapy, the oxygen therapy must be stepped down to the lowest level required to maintain a saturation range of 88–92%. This may be achieved using 28% or 24% oxygen from a Venturi mask or 1–2 L/min via nasal cannulae depending on oxygen saturation and subsequent blood gas measurements.
✓ Sudden cessation of supplementary oxygen therapy can cause life-threatening rebound hypoxaemia with a rapid fall in oxygen saturations below the starting oxygen saturation prior to the start of supplementary oxygen therapy.

G3. Initial oxygen treatment of cystic fibrosis exacerbations should be similar to the initial oxygen treatment of COPD exacerbations with target saturation 88–92% (see sections 8.12.1–8.12.2) (grade D).
G4. In the initial management of musculoskeletal and neurological disorders with acute respiratory failure, or acute-on-chronic respiratory failure, aim at an oxygen saturation of 88–92% and measure blood gases to determine if NIV will be required (grade D).

Good practice point regarding patients with neurological disorders

✓ Patients with respiratory failure due to neurological disorders or muscle disease are at high risk of dying and require urgent assessment to determine if they are likely to require non-invasive or invasive ventilator support rather than oxygen therapy. Monitor these patients with blood gases and regular spirometry (forced vital capacity). Patients' wishes regarding this form of treatment should established as early as possible in the course of the illness, ideally before an acute episode has developed.
G5. Morbidly obese patients (body mass index (BMI) > 40 kg/m 2), even without evidence of coexistent obstructive sleep apnoea are at risk of hypoventilation and should be given titrated oxygen to maintain a target saturation of 88–92% (grade D).
G6. NIV should be considered for hypercapnic patients with COPD, CF, neuromuscular disorders or morbid obesity who are at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure if the pH is < 7.35 or [H+] > 45 nmol/L (grade D) (see BTS/ICS Guidelines for the Ventilatory Management of Acute Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure in Adults).

### Radiologic evaluation of acute chest pain-suspected… [^116gVSmi]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

Persons presenting to the emergency department with chest pain may be experiencing acute coronary syndrome, dissecting aortic aneurysm, pulmonary embolism, or possibly a less serious event. Timing is important when diagnosing these patients, so it is vital to quickly and accurately establish a diagnosis. The American College of Radiology recently elected to evaluate and assign appropriateness ratings for selected imaging tests used in the evaluation of acute chest pain — suspected myocardial ischemia. 1 In most patients with acute coronary syndrome, the initial evaluation is done with electrocardiography and measurement of serum creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme or serum cardiac troponin levels. Electrocardiography and elevated cardiac markers may be all that are needed to establish a diagnosis and initiate treatment; however, if these tests are indeterminate, other imaging tests need to be considered.

Most of the 5 million patients with chest pain presenting to the emergency department do not have a cardiac etiology and, therefore, other imaging tests are usually needed. Illustrative Case A 54-year-old man with diabetes presents to the emergency department with dyspnea on exertion and a remote history of chest pain. He is a two-pack-per-day smoker and has a strong family history of heart disease. Two weeks ago, he experienced an episode of chest pressure that was accompanied by diaphoresis. His physical examination was normal with the exception of a recorded blood pressure of 149/87 mm Hg and a fasting blood glucose level of 275 mg per dL. An electrocardiogram, chest radiograph, and initial set of enzymes were normal; however, the patient was still admitted for further evaluation because of the classic cardiac symptoms and risk factors for coronary artery disease.

The preliminary diagnosis was chest pain of suspected ischemic origin, and it was decided that the patient should undergo conventional coronary angiography. TTE Myocardial ischemia may be the etiology for chest pain, especially if abnormalities of left ventricular wall motion are detected. 5–8 The most significant advantages of TTE are its portability and noninvasiveness. Depending on the location, wall-motion abnormalities are often, but not always, identifiable with TTE. 6 In addition to wall-motion abnormalities, other helpful findings would be the identification of a left ventricular aneurysm or the presence of valvular dysfunction. TTE also is helpful in diagnosing pericardial effusions.

Baseline data

Patient characteristics

A total of 72 patients were included in the baseline audit.

Mean age was 62 ± 18 years (median – 67 years).
49% were male (35/72), 51% were female (37/72).
None of the patients had a valid prescription on CERNER (electronic database).
The duration, target range and indications for oxygen therapy were documented through communication orders in 25% (18/72), 45.8% (33/72) and 42% 30/72 patients, respectively.
Data collection was time period bound, meaning all patients admitted to acute medical admission unit (AMAU) requiring oxygen therapy in a 4 weeks time.
All patients were non-critically ill admitted to AMAU or the medical floor.

Our baseline study shows that there is limited awareness of BTS guidelines in the following aspects:

Initiation of oxygen therapy — rate, route and type.
Target saturation specific about each condition.
Weaning-off oxygen therapy.

Our initial audit survey results showed that none of the patients had appropriate oxygen therapy orders as per standard.

A total of 75% of patients had oxygen prescribed as only communication order, and 25% had no orders.
A total of 47% of the patients on oxygen therapy had their oxygen saturations out of their recommended range.
A total of 55% of the patients had no indication for oxygen therapy documented in their notes.

### A new oxygen prescription produces real improvements in therapeutic oxygen use [^113aJcHg]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

In the UK, safe use and administration of oxygen therapy was unsatisfactory prior to the implementation of national guidelines in 2008. Each year since then the British Thoracic Society (BTS) has conducted a national audit that has demonstrated a slow but steady improvement in oxygen use across four key standards. Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Hospitals Trust has participated in this audit process but has failed to show consistent improvements. The aim of this quality improvement project was to produce meaningful and sustained improvements in oxygen use across each of the four standards. Four interventions were developed over three PDSA cycles and included: 1. a new oxygen prescription chart, 2. oxygen 'alert' stickers for use on drug and MEWS charts, 3. point of care resources, and 4. senior led educational sessions for healthcare staff. Each intervention was tested on the Acute Medical Unit over seven days and data collected using the BTS data collection form. The QIP improved oxygen use across each of the standards: baseline measurement for standard one demonstrated that 55% of patients using oxygen had a valid oxygen prescription, improving to 94% after PDSA cycle three. For standard two, baseline measurement demonstrated that 50% of patients had a documented oxygen target saturation range, improving to 94% after PDSA cycle three. For standard three, baseline measurement demonstrated that 84% patients using oxygen had saturations documented on the MEWS chart, improving to 100% after PDSA cycle three. Finally, baseline measurement of standard four demonstrated that 0% patients with a valid oxygen prescription had it signed for at drugs rounds, improving to 18% after PDSA cycle three. Oxygen use was substantially improved during the QIP. Following engagement with stakeholders a new oxygen prescription will be rolled out within the Trust with projected annual savings of £30,400.

### BTS clinical statement on air travel for passengers with respiratory disease [^115fPF9y]. Thorax (2022). Medium credibility.

Infants and children

In general, similar considerations apply to both adults and children if they have severe chronic airway disease, or require chronic supplementary oxygen, or non-invasive or tracheostomy ventilation. Both children and adults with these conditions require a preflight assessment. Similarly, unless otherwise stated, recommendations for individuals with previous thoracic surgery, pneumothorax or empyema apply to both adults and children. There are, however, some specific considerations for infants and younger children since several factors place infants at greater risk of developing hypoxia. These factors include left shift of the oxygen dissociation curve (due to the presence of foetal haemoglobin), smaller airway diameter, relatively fewer alveoli, compliant rib cage and increased tendency to pulmonary vasoconstriction and bronchoconstriction and thus ventilation–perfusion mismatch under hypoxic conditions. Moreover, preterm infants and infants under 2 months of age may develop apnoea/hypoventilation in response to hypoxia or infection. Beyond 3 months of age there is no evidence that ex-preterm infants, without bronchopulmonary dysplasia, are at significantly greater risk of desaturation during a HCT than term infants.

In addition to very young and ex-preterm infants, the children most at risk of hypoxia are those with anaemia, congenital heart disease with an actual or potential right to left shunt, neuromuscular disorders or chronic or acute lung disease. Low humidity during air travel can also present a problem for children with respiratory conditions such as CF. Those most at risk of complications associated with reduced air pressure are children with upper respiratory tract infections, or trapped intrathoracic air, including those with recent pneumothorax or cystic lung disease.

For infants born at term (> 37 weeks) it is prudent to delay flying for 1 week after birth to ensure they are healthy. In view of their greater risk of apnoea and hypoxia, infants born prematurely (< 37 weeks) with or without a history of respiratory disease who have not reached their expected date of delivery at the time of flying should have in-flight oxygen available. HCT may not be a reliable guide of oxygen requirement in this group. If air travel is essential, they should travel with oxygen at a tolerable low flow, recognising that this may be a minimum of 1 L/min depending on equipment.

The following Clinical Practice Points are specific to infants and children.

### AARC clinical practice guideline: management of adult patients with oxygen in the acute care setting [^1126Mjg4]. Respiratory Care (2022). High credibility.

AARC clinical practice guideline — oxygen saturation targets in acute and critical illness recommends population-specific ranges with supporting evidence. The committee recommends SpO2 94–98% for acutely and critically ill adults, 88–92% for critically ill adults with CO2 retention and/or COPD, and 88–93% for critically ill patients requiring FIO2 of 0.70 or higher who are not invasively ventilated with a high PEEP strategy. Supporting evidence cited includes that liberal oxygen targets led to higher 30-d mortality across 25 RCTs including 16,000 subjects with median SpO2 96% in the liberal oxygen group, and that an optimal SpO2 target of 94–98% was found in another study.

### Determination of oxygen saturation compared to a prescribed target range using continuous pulse oximetry in acutely unwell medical patients [^111oUYhi]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

There are no previous studies using continuous oximetry to determine time exposure to SpO 2 outside of a prescribed target range, however our results are consistent with other work demonstrating over-oxygenation is common in a general ward setting. The BTS national emergency oxygen audit in 2015 demonstrated 21% of patients with a prescribed target range had SpO 2 above this range when measured at a single timepoint. A retrospective study of patients admitted to hospital with an acute exacerbation of COPD demonstrated over-oxygenation in 62% of admissions. A further study using random pulse oximetry measurements in hospitalised patients receiving oxygen on a ward setting demonstrated oxygen was not required in 61% of cases. The percentage of time spent in range is also in keeping with the control arm of studies comparing automated to manual oxygen titration in a ward setting, although these results were obtained in the context of a randomised controlled trial and may not represent usual clinical practice. Our finding that under-oxygenation is also common, particularly overnight, reflects the use of continuous SpO 2 measurement over a 24-h period which detected desaturation which may otherwise go unnoticed between nursing observations. The novel aspects of this study include: the non-interventional use of continuous oximetry to accurately reflect the "real world" practice of manual oxygen titration in a ward setting, the evaluation of clinical factors which influence time spent in range and finally the detailed description of time exposure to significant deviation from a prescribed SpO 2 target range.

### Changing an ingrained culture: improving the safety of oxygen therapy at university hospitals bristol NHS foundation trust [^114LuG9b]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Baseline measurement

Oxygen prescriptions are routinely audited across the UK by the BTS emergency oxygen prescription audit. We selected a number of different parameters from the BTS audit to form our project data:

Is the oxygen prescribed on the drug chart?
Has oxygen been appropriately signed for in the last 24 hours?
Was the patients last oxygen saturation within the target range?

Our data was collected at approximately monthly intervals over a period of 16 months. During this time two trust-wide audits were completed. At the other time points data was collected from wards with a high number of patients receiving oxygen. These wards became our "target wards". They included the:

- Medical admissions unit

- Older persons admissions unit

- Surgical and trauma admissions unit

- Respiratory wards

- Thoracic surgery ward.

At our first data collection point we found that 74 patients were receiving oxygen therapy within the hospital (not including accident and emergency department). 44.4% of patients receiving oxygen had a valid prescription. Of the patients who were receiving oxygen therapy with target ranges indicated, three were > 2% above the target range, placing them at serious risk of type 2 respiratory failure. Oxygen was signed for by nursing staff on 26.6% of drug rounds. 61.8% of patients were within their target range.

### British thoracic society guidelines for home oxygen use in adults [^1157g7sH]. Thorax (2015). Low credibility.

The British Thoracic Society (BTS) Home Oxygen Guideline provides detailed evidence-based guidance for the use of home oxygen for patients out of hospital. Although the majority of evidence comes from the use of oxygen in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the scope of the guidance includes patients with a variety of long-term respiratory illnesses and other groups in whom oxygen is currently ordered, such as those with cardiac failure, cancer and end-stage cardiorespiratory disease, terminal illness or cluster headache. It explores the evidence base for the use of different modalities of oxygen therapy and patient-related outcomes such as mortality, symptoms and quality of life. The guideline also makes recommendations for assessment and follow-up protocols, and risk assessments, particularly in the clinically challenging area of home oxygen users who smoke. The guideline development group is aware of the potential for confusion sometimes caused by the current nomenclature for different types of home oxygen, and rather than renaming them, has adopted the approach of clarifying those definitions, and in particular emphasising what is meant by long-term oxygen therapy and palliative oxygen therapy. The home oxygen guideline provides expert consensus opinion in areas where clinical evidence is lacking, and seeks to deliver improved prescribing practice, leading to improved compliance and improved patient outcomes, with consequent increased value to the health service.

### Automated audit of hospital oxygen use devised during the COVID-19 pandemic [^116fLkot]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Methods

Salford Royal Hospital (now part of the Northern Care Alliance NHS Foundation Trust) is a 900-bed urban university hospital. The hospital has used the Sunrise EMR system since August 2000. The current version is Sunrise-Altera (formerly Sunrise-Allscripts) Release 18.4. This EMR routinely records demographic data and clinical data in addition to patient location within the hospital. Hospital policy since 2010 is that all in-patients should have a prescription with a target oxygen saturation range so that, in the event of deterioration, nursing staff will know what oxygen levels are appropriate for each patient.

Prescribing at Salford Royal is undertaken within the EMR. Oxygen prescriptions specify a target range of 92–96% for the majority of patients and a target range of 88–92% or an individualised target range for patients who are at risk of developing hypercapnia in response to oxygen therapy (most commonly patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). The 'standard' target range for patients with no risk of hypercapnia was previously 94–98% in line with the BTS Oxygen Guideline prior to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Since then, it has been changed to 92–96% in line with NHS Pandemic guidance and in line with the 2015 Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand guidance and the 2018 guideline by Siemieniuk et al which predated the pandemic. Manual audits from the introduction of online oxygen prescribing at Salford Royal in 2011 up to the BTS audit in 2015 have shown that about 90% of Salford patients using supplemental oxygen had an appropriate prescription, compared with an average of about 55% across the UK.

### Impact of oxygen concentration on time to resolution of spontaneous pneumothorax in term infants: a population based cohort study [^113NJV1X]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Based on initial fraction of inspired oxygen concentration used at admission for the treatment of SP, neonates were divided into three groups: high fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2)/nitrogen washout (HO: FiO 2 ≥ 60%), moderate oxygen (MO: FiO 2 < 60%) or room air (RA: FiO 2 = 21%). The decision to treat a patient with room air, high or moderate oxygen concentration was based on individual attending neonatologist preference.

The initial concentration of oxygen used for treatment of spontaneous pneumothorax was the primary exposure variable. Duration of oxygen therapy was calculated from the initiation of oxygen therapy until clinical resolution of pneumothorax or till treatment failure (development of tension pneumothorax within 72 hours of diagnosis and treatment of SP). Data on maximum O 2 concentration inspired during the treatment period was based on the highest recorded dose documented in the chart. The method of oxygen delivery at the time of admission was either via oxyhood, or nasal cannula. The concentration of inspired oxygen via oxyhood was analyzed through an oxygen analyzer. The concentration of inspired oxygen through nasal prongs was calculated according to the "STOP- ROP effective FiO 2 conversion table", a modified equation described by Benaron and Benitz. The severity of respiratory distress was classified according to the validated "Acute care of at-risk newborn (ACoRN)" respiratory score. The estimation of pneumothorax size was abstracted from the radiologist report; radiologists were blinded to the treatment group. There was no validated method available to measure the size of pneumothorax on CXR in neonates so an estimation was made according to adult guidelines as mentioned in the British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines, and from the neonatal literature.

Clinical resolution of pneumothorax was defined as cessation of respiratory distress and discontinuation of oxygen treatment with maintenance of SpO 2 ≥ 95%. Nitrogen washout was defined in our NICU as the use of 60 to 100% of inspired O 2 continuously for at least 6 hours.

Time to clinical resolution of spontaneous pneumothorax, measured in hours was the primary outcome variable. Neonates were followed from admission until clinical resolution of pneumothorax as documented in the patient chart. The secondary outcome variables were length of hospital stay for the treatment of pneumothorax and treatment failure (development of tension pneumothorax within 72 hours of diagnosis and treatment of SP). Tension pneumothorax was characterized by rapid instability of vital signs and shifting of the mediastinum on CXR, requiring thoracocentesis, chest tube insertion or mechanical ventilation.

### Home oxygen therapy for adults with chronic lung disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111HAx24]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

What others are saying

A 2015 British Thoracic Society (BTS) guideline recommends that patients with stable COPD and severe resting hypoxemia (Pa O 2 ≤ 55 mm Hg [7.3 kPa]), or with a resting Pa O 2 ≤ 60 mm Hg (8.0 kPa) with evidence of peripheral edema, hematocrit ≥ 55, or PH, should be considered for LTOT because of its survival benefits and potential to improve pulmonary hemodynamics. They recommend LTOT be used for 15–24 h/d. The Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand (TSANZ) recommends titrating oxygen to maintain a Pa O 2 > 60 mm Hg (8.0 kPa) or an Sp O 2 > 90% during waking at rest. The Global Initiative for Chronic Lung Disease (GOLD) report recommends LTOT if Sp O 2 is ≤ 88% and recommends oxygen titration to maintain a saturation of ≥ 90% in patients with COPD.

Implementation considerations

Severe hypoxemia was defined using different thresholds in the two RCTs that reported our critical outcome of survival (Pa O 2 ≤ 55 mm Hg [7.3 kPa] or Pa O 2 ≤ 59 mm Hg [7.9 kPa] plus one of the following: edema, hematocrit ≥ 55%, or P pulmonale on ECG; vs. Pa O 2 40–60 mm Hg [5.3–8.0 kPa]). Because a mortality benefit was demonstrated in both studies, the panel concluded that either definition of severe hypoxemia is clinically justified.

Neither clinical trial reported Sp O 2 -based thresholds for severe hypoxemia. We recognize that the relationship between Sp O 2 and Pa O 2 can vary because of an individual's pH, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate concentration, Pa CO 2, and temperature. However, the guideline panel concluded that providing approximate thresholds for Sp O 2 that correspond to the Pa O 2 thresholds used in the NOTT and MRC studies would improve the usability of the guideline report in circumstances in which arterial blood gas measurements were not available. The panel suggests titrating the level of LTOT to achieve a target saturation of 90%, as opposed to 88% in some guidelines, to avoid prolonged episodes of desaturation with minimal activity.

### When should I be considering home oxygen for my patients? [^117MRSFX]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Should oxygen be used in breathless patients, in the absence of hypoxaemia?

This is a typical COPD presentation, with first symptoms occurring in late adulthood following a significant smoking history and accompanied by supporting changes on spirometry. In this context, patients often experience frightening and debilitating breathlessness. Of note, his saturations remain well preserved on air (i.e. > 92%), demonstrating that he is not hypoxaemic at rest. What is the role, if any, of oxygen in this setting?

The British Thoracic Society (BTS) oxygen guideline summarises the evidence for, and provides recommendation on, the different options for home oxygen therapy (listed in Table 1). Box 1 summarises the key recommendations from the guideline. Previously, both short-burst oxygen therapy (SBOT) and ambulatory oxygen therapy (AOT) have been considered for nonhypoxaemic patients with disabling breathlessness. The evidence to support this, however, is limited.

### Time for change in practice of in-patient oxygen therapy: a period-limited, multidimensional approach to improve oxygen prescription compliance: quality improvement project at hamad general hospital, Qatar [^1163nsQe]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Prescription of oxygen therapy has traditionally poor compliance across the globe and mostly given to patients on verbal orders leading to under or overuse. The British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines (2017) recommend that oxygen therapy must be prescribed. Our study aimed to assess the prescription practice of oxygen therapy for patients admitted to acute medical assessment unit and general medical wards at Hamad General Hospital, Qatar and to achieve 80% compliance of valid oxygen therapy prescription implementing the quality improvement model against the BTS guidelines. The prescription practice of oxygen therapy was audited between April 2019 and August 2019. Using a Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) model of improvement and multiple interventions was performed in the eight PDSA cycles, including (1) educational sessions for residents/fellows/nurses, (2) introduction of electronic prescription, (3) emails, posters/flyers, (4) nurse-led reminders and (5) re-enforced teaching for new residents. Data were then collected using a questionnaire assessing electronic prescriptions and documentation. Our baseline study regarding oxygen therapy showed limited awareness of BTS guidelines regarding the documentation of initiation and further adjustment of oxygen therapy. There was a lack of compliance with oxygen prescription; none of the patients had a valid prescription on our computer-based prescription (Cerner). The duration, target range and indications of Oxygen therapy were documented in 25% (18/72), 45.8% (33/72) and 42% (30/72) patients, respectively. Oxygen was initiated by communication order only. In a total of 16 weeks period, the repeated PDSA cycles showed significant improvement in safe oxygen prescription practices. Following intervention, oxygen electronic prescription, documentation of indications for oxygen therapy, target oxygen saturation and wean-off plan improved to 93%, 85%, 86% and 80%, respectively. We concluded that poor compliance to oxygen therapy Orders is a universal issue, which can be successfully managed using small-scale PDSA cycles to ensure sustained improvement through multidimensional interventions, continuous reinforcement and frequent reassessments.

### Administration of 100% oxygen does not hasten resolution of symptomatic spontaneous pneumothorax in neonates [^115AFiRL]. Journal of Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of 100% oxygen therapy vs oxygen treatment with targeted pulse oximetry in the management of symptomatic small to moderate spontaneous pneumothorax (SP). In total, 100% oxygen treatment for SP has been a common practice in neonatology, albeit there is little evidence to validate its efficacy.

Study Design

A retrospective chart review of 83 neonatal records with the diagnosis of pneumothorax was conducted. Infants < 35 weeks gestation, those with large pneumothoraces requiring chest tube drainage and/or ventilatory support were excluded. Data gathered included demographics, vital signs, treatment information and clinical indicators of resolution of symptoms.

Result

In total, 45 neonates with SP were included in the study. Groups were similar for gestational age, birth weight, Apgar scores, gravidity, parity, gender, race, pneumothorax size and location. Patients in the 100% oxygen therapy group received a significantly longer oxygen treatment (21.3 vs 8 h, P < 0.001), required longer intravenous fluid treatment (48.6 ± 29.9 vs 31.3 ± 18.8 h, P = 0.03) and were delayed in reaching full feeds (44.1 ± 25.7 vs 29.5 ± 18.8 h, P = 0.03) compared with the oxygen-targeted treatment group. Time to first oral feeding, time to resolution of tachypnea and length of stay were similar in both groups.

Conclusion

There are no clinically significant advantages to using 100% oxygen in the treatment of symptomatic small to moderate SP. In fact, it may result in longer exposure to unnecessary oxygen treatment and toxicity. Oxygen should be reserved for those who are hypoxic and adjusted to comply with accepted saturation levels in neonates.

### British thoracic society guideline for oxygen use in adults in healthcare and emergency settings [^111uzeny]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2017). Medium credibility.

Good practice point: patients requiring increased concentration of oxygen
✓ The requirement for an increased concentration of oxygen is an indication for urgent clinical reassessment of the patient (and repeat blood gas measurements in most instances, see recommendations W13 and W18 for exceptions).

D. Initial oxygen therapy; initial choice of equipment for patients who do not have critical illness (see figures 1–2 and table 2 and full Guideline sections 8.9 and 10) i

Initial oxygen therapy in critical illness is covered in the next section.
D1. For acutely breathless patients not at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure who have saturations below 85%, treatment should be started with a reservoir mask at 15 L/min in the first instance. The oxygen concentration can be adjusted downwards (using nasal cannulae at 1–6 L/min or a simple face mask at 5–10 L/min) to maintain a target saturation of 94–98% once the patient has stabilised (grade D).
D2. In other cases of acute hypoxaemia without critical illness or risk factors for hypercapnic respiratory failure, treatment should be started with nasal cannulae (or a simple face mask if cannulae are not tolerated or not effective) with the flow rate adjusted to achieve a saturation of 94–98% (grade D).
D3. If medium-concentration therapy with nasal cannulae or a simple face mask does not achieve the desired saturation, change to a reservoir mask and seek senior or specialist advice (grade D).

### British thoracic society guideline for oxygen use in adults in healthcare and emergency settings [^113StP19]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2017). Medium credibility.

Areas not covered by this guideline

Oxygen use in paediatrics: the present guideline applies only to patients aged > 16 years.
Oxygen use for high altitude activities.
Oxygen use during air travel.
Underwater diving and diving accidents.
Oxygen use in animal experiments.
Oxygen use in high-dependency units.

Self-initiated use of oxygen by patients who have home oxygen for any reason.
Ongoing care of hypoxaemic patients at home.

Limitations of the guideline

This guideline is based on the best available evidence concerning oxygen therapy. However, a guideline can never be a substitute for clinical judgement in individual cases. There may be cases where it is appropriate for clinicians to act outwith the advice contained in this guideline because of the needs of individual patients, especially those with complex or interacting disease states. Furthermore, the responsibility for the care of individual patients rests with the clinician in charge of the patient's care and the advice offered in this guideline must, of necessity, be of a general nature and should not be relied on as the only source of advice in the treatment of individual patients. In particular, this guideline gives very little advice about the management of the many medical conditions that may cause hypoxaemia (apart from the specific issue of managing the patients' hypoxaemia). Readers are referred to other guidelines for advice on the management of specific conditions such as COPD, pneumonia, heart failure etc. Some of these disease-specific guidelines may suggest slightly different approaches to emergency oxygen therapy whereas the present guideline aims to provide simple all-embracing advice about oxygen therapy.

Definitions of terms used in the guideline (and normal values)

Terms such as hypoxaemia and normal values for oxygen and carbon dioxide in blood gases are provided in the full Guideline (sections 3–6).

Planned review and updating of the guideline

The 2017 guideline will be reviewed by BTS within 5 years from publication.

### Impact of oxygen concentration on time to resolution of spontaneous pneumothorax in term infants: a population based cohort study [^111tuN7y]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This study has been the first to determine the time to clinical resolution of spontaneous pneumothorax in term neonates treated with room air and different concentrations of inhaled oxygen. We found that supplemental oxygen use was not associated with faster resolution of SP in HO and MO groups. Neonates who were treated with room air rather than supplemental oxygen did not have longer recovery times. Oxygen treatment for pneumothorax should be viewed as a prescribed drug, with documentation for its indication, target saturation and titration goals. Future prospective trials for the treatment of symptomatic spontaneous pneumothorax using 100% inspired oxygen concentration vs. room air in sick neonates with targeted SpO 2 goal, will be beneficial in developing an acceptable treatment guideline for term neonates.

### BTS clinical statement on air travel for passengers with respiratory disease [^111kpHNB]. Thorax (2022). Medium credibility.

Bronchoscopic procedures

The risks associated with air travel are not only those of a possible pneumothorax, but also the effects of sedation, exacerbation of pre-existing or new symptoms such as cough, hoarse voice haemoptysis and dyspnoea, respiratory infection and the consequences of arrhythmias observed during the procedure.

Clinical practice points

The opinion of the interventionalist should be obtained before the patient travels by air.
Patients should be clinically stable before they travel.
After interventional bronchoscopy including TBNA, TBB, EBUS and endobronchial valve insertion, those with no pneumothorax seen on the postprocedure chest X-ray should wait for 1 week before air travel.
After interventional bronchoscopy including TBNA, TBB and EBUS, those with a pneumothorax seen on the postprocedure chest X-ray should wait for 1 week after resolution on chest X-ray before air travel.

Pleural disease

Pleural effusion

Patients with stable pleural disease and normal resting oxygen saturations should be able to fly without further precautions. Those who have indwelling long-term drainage catheters should be reminded that the manufacturers do not advise air travel. Those who choose to travel should be encouraged to take a supply of drainage bottles for their time away.

In those with a recent onset pleural effusion, investigation should be delayed if air travel is planned within 2 weeks, since intervention may increase the risk of pneumothorax. The risk of delaying investigation should be discussed with the individual to determine whether travel plans can be modified.

### Effect of a lower target oxygen saturation range on the risk of hypoxaemia and elevated NEWS2 scores at a university hospital: a retrospective study [^116KZT7Z]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Background

The optimal target oxygen saturation (SpO 2) range for hospital inpatients not at risk of hypercapnia is unknown. The objective of this study was to assess the impact on oxygen usage and National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) of changing the standard SpO 2 target range from 94–98% to 92–96%.

Methods

In a metropolitan UK hospital, a database of electronic bedside SpO 2 measurements, oxygen prescriptions and NEWS2 records was reviewed. Logistic regression was used to compare the proportion of hypoxaemic SpO 2 values (< 90%) and NEWS2 records ≥ 5 in 2019, when the target SpO 2 range was 94–98%; with 2022, when the target range was 92–96%.

Results

In 2019, 218 of 224 936 (0.10%) observations on room air and 162 of 11 328 (1.43%) on oxygen recorded an SpO 2 < 90%, and in 2022, 251 of 225 970 (0.11%) and 233 of 12 845 (1.81%), respectively (risk difference 0.04%, 95% CI 0.02% to 0.07%). NEWS2 ≥ 5 was observed in 3009 of 236 264 (1.27%) observations in 2019 and 4061 of 238 815 (1.70%) in 2022 (risk difference 0.43%, 0.36% to 0.50%; p < 0.001). The proportion of patients using supplemental oxygen with hyperoxaemia (SpO 2 100%) was 5.4% in 2019 and 3.9% in 2022 (OR 0.71, 0.63 to 0.81; p < 0.001).

Discussion

The proportion of observations with SpO 2 < 90%or NEWS2 ≥ 5 was greater with the 92–96% range; however, absolute differences were very small and of doubtful clinical relevance, in contrast to hyperoxaemia for which the proportion was markedly less in 2022. These findings support proposals that the British Thoracic Society oxygen guidelines could recommend a lower target SpO 2 range.

### BTS clinical statement on air travel for passengers with respiratory disease [^111c1Mja]. Thorax (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice points: HCT results

PaO 2 ≥ 6.6 kPa (≥ 50 mm Hg) or SpO 2 ≥ 85%: in-flight oxygen not required.
PaO 2 < 6.6 kPa (< 50 mm Hg) or SpO 2 < 85%: in-flight oxygen recommended.
Where required, titrate oxygen to maintain PaO 2 ≥ 6.6 kPa or SpO 2 ≥ 85% in adults, SpO 2 90% in children aged 1 year or more.

Air travel may be contraindicated in infrequent cases when supplementary oxygen, at the flow rate needed to maintain PaO 2 ≥ 6.6 kPa or SpO 2 ≥ 85%, causes significant changes to pH and pCO 2. The 2015 BTS Guidelines for Home Oxygen Use in Adultsconsider that a pH < 7.35, and a PaCO 2 increase > 1 kPa from baseline (within 20 min) is significant. Specialist respiratory physicians should use their discretion to determine the risk in individual cases and advise accordingly. Where hyperventilation is suspected, especially in response to anxiety rather than hypoxaemia, results should be interpreted with caution as there is a risk of false negative results.

HCT methods

### Initiative to improve oxygen prescribing and oxygen delivery to patients in the emergency department of a national referral hospital [^113FbhyQ]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Strategy and results

We completed five PDSA cycles during the 12-week period. The team held regular progress meetings fortnightly. These meetings were initiated by the leader and reviewed the progress and effectiveness of the PDSA cycle.

PSDA cycle 1: sensitisation and education about oxygen therapy and BTS guidelines (weeks 1 and 2; n = 59)

The first intervention was to educate the staff about the indication and use of oxygen, BTS guidelines and the importance of oxygen prescription in patients. This intervention was planned since lack of knowledge/awareness was identified as one of the causes of poor oxygen prescription in the survey. All the staff working in the ED were divided into three groups, and the didactic session was carried out by one of the team members. Sensitisation included indication of oxygen, oxygen devices and use, importance of oxygen prescription and monitoring of the oxygen use. BTS guidelines with details of target saturation and effects of hypoxaemia and hyperoxaemia were described and how we can improve oxygen prescription and oxygen use. They were also shown the initial baseline survey and what we need to do to improve our indicators.

Starting with the lecture and didactic session helped challenge the common misconception that oxygen is not a drug and emphasised the requirement of prescription like any other drug. At the end of the cycle, process indicators 1 and 2 have completion of 36% and 45% from initial baselines of 20% and 23%. The outcome measurement saw an increase from 33% to 67%.

### BTS clinical statement on air travel for passengers with respiratory disease [^113REYDb]. Thorax (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice points

The patient's condition should be optimised before travel, with attention paid to inhaler technique and smoking cessation referral where appropriate.
All medications and spacer devices should be carried in hand luggage to mitigate the risk of missing hold baggage.
Emergency medications, including salbutamol inhalers and spacers, must be immediately accessible.
For acute exacerbations on board, the passenger's own bronchodilator inhaler should be given, with a spacer if appropriate.
Passengers with severe COPD are advised to carry a copy of their COPD management plan and/or relevant clinic letters. This information can be held securely as scanned copies on their mobile phone A history of previous pneumothorax or bullous lung disease necessitates assessment by a respiratory specialist to determine the potential risk of complications from reduced cabin pressure.
Patients with COPD are at greater risk of VTE as a direct consequence of the underlying condition, as well as after an exacerbation. They should be advised accordingly, especially if planning longer flights when the risk is further enhanced.
Patients requiring long-term oxygen therapy should also plan for oxygen supplementation at their destination (see online supplemental appendix 1).
Wherever possible, those who have had a recent exacerbation of their condition should not fly until their condition is stable and use of reliever therapy has returned to their usual baseline. If their condition deteriorates while overseas, medical advice should be sought before undertaking the return flight.
