## Question

What does perichrondritis mean?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what perichondritis means. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the literal definition and anatomic substrate. Then, I should verify the most common clinical context and key distinguishing bedside features. Next, I will review pathophysiology and microbiology, followed by etiologies and risk factors. After that, I need to examine clinical presentation and the differential, including mimics. Then, I should confirm complications and why urgency matters. Finally, I will outline evidence-aligned management and place the entity in a broader context beyond the ear, ending with a concise synthesis.

> Let me first confirm the literal meaning and tissue involved. Perichondritis literally denotes inflammation of the perichondrium, the fibrous connective tissue that envelops cartilage; because cartilage is avascular, the perichondrium is crucial for its nutrition and viability, so inflammation here has outsized structural consequences if not promptly treated.

> Next, I should verify the most common clinical context. Although perichondritis can theoretically occur wherever cartilage and perichondrium exist, the external ear is by far the typical site discussed in practice, specifically auricular perichondritis of the cartilaginous pinna; it characteristically spares the lobule because the lobule lacks cartilage, and the referenced otolaryngology summary even notes sparing of the lobule and tragus, but wait, let me verify — classically the tragus is cartilaginous and may be involved, so I will note that some sources emphasize lobule sparing as the key discriminator, while the cited article describes sparing of both lobule and tragus in their context [^117V6nXF].

> Hold on, I should verify the pathophysiology before jumping to causes. Because cartilage depends on diffusion from the perichondrium, infection or inflammation in the perichondrial layer can cause edema and microvascular compromise; auricular hematomas in the subperichondrial plane physically separate perichondrium from cartilage, starving it of nutrients and predisposing to perichondritis, necrosis, and fibrocartilaginous deformity if not promptly addressed [^111tSnhM] [^117V6nXF].

> I will now examine etiologies and risk factors. Direct trauma, contact sports, and auricular hematoma are common antecedents; high ear cartilage piercings are a major modern driver and are frequently associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa; perichondritis can also follow surgical manipulation of auricular cartilage, particularly when perichondrial integrity is violated; recurrent episodes should prompt me to check for host factors such as diabetes or immunosuppression, as illustrated by a pediatric case in whom recurrent auricular perichondritis heralded undiagnosed type 1 diabetes mellitus [^113AVCPD] [^115WsPJV] [^111tSnhM] [^1156E45q].

> Let me think about the clinical phenotype and key bedside clues. Patients typically report disproportionate ear pain with erythema, warmth, and tender swelling confined to the cartilaginous auricle with sparing of the soft, noncartilaginous lobule; fever and systemic symptoms can occur in more severe disease; abscess formation is a pivotal turning point and strongly correlates with complications, so I should palpate for fluctuance and consider imaging or needle aspiration if uncertain [^117V6nXF] [^113AVCPD].

> Next, I should review the differential and not jump to conclusions. Relapsing polychondritis is an autoimmune mimic with auricular chondritis that classically spares the lobes and often coexists with nasal, airway, ocular, or joint involvement, and requires immunomodulatory rather than antibiotic therapy; cauliflower ear reflects chronic sequelae of un-evacuated hematoma rather than active infection; cellulitis tends to involve the lobule and overlying skin rather than the cartilage; tophaceous gout can deposit on the helical rim and antihelix but presents with chalky nodules; even rare neoplasms such as squamoid eccrine ductal carcinoma can mimic perichondritis clinically, so I need to keep atypical, nonresolving, or recurrent cases under diagnostic scrutiny [^115FYUvi] [^117FmXqi] [^113dg3Cg].

> I should confirm why time-sensitive treatment matters. Persistent perichondrial inflammation and superinfection risk ischemia, suppurative chondritis, cartilage necrosis, and permanent auricular deformity; in the hematoma-perichondritis spectrum, delay increases the likelihood of structural collapse and the characteristic "cauliflower ear" deformity, underscoring the need for early evacuation, antibiotics, and close follow-up [^117V6nXF] [^111tSnhM] [^115WsPJV].

> Let me now outline management principles and double-check antimicrobial choices. Empiric antibiotics should cover Pseudomonas in adults, with fluoroquinolones often used when appropriate, and therapy is commonly continued for about 7–10 days with adjustments based on culture and clinical course; if an abscess is present, prompt incision and drainage are indicated, with cartilage-sparing debridement reserved for severe cases to reduce deformity; when a concomitant auricular hematoma is identified, evacuation with compression bolsters and early reassessment at 24–48 hours help prevent recurrence; activity restriction, such as avoiding contact sports for at least two weeks, reduces re-injury risk while healing proceeds [^111tSnhM] [^117V6nXF] [^113AVCPD].

> But wait, what if the inflammation is not in the pinna at all? Perichondritis can also involve laryngeal structures, occasionally presenting with voice change, airway symptoms, and Pseudomonas infection on culture, and should be distinguished from malignancy or tuberculosis; conversely, costochondritis is an anterior chest wall pain syndrome of the costochondral junctions and is typically noninfectious and self-limited, so I need to ensure I'm not conflating a sterile inflammatory process with a bacterial perichondritis of cartilage elsewhere [^111tSnhM] [^11326LTh].

> Final synthesis: Perichondritis is inflammation, most often infection, of the perichondrium surrounding cartilage, classically affecting the auricular cartilage of the external ear and sparing the noncartilaginous lobule; trauma, cartilage piercing, surgical manipulation, hematoma, and metabolic host factors predispose, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa commonly implicated; the clinical picture is painful erythematous swelling of the cartilaginous pinna, and urgent recognition matters because avascular cartilage rapidly progresses to ischemic necrosis and deformity without timely antibiotics, drainage when indicated, and structural protection, while mimics such as relapsing polychondritis, cellulitis, and crystalline or neoplastic conditions must be considered if the course is atypical or refractory [^117V6nXF] [^111tSnhM] [^113AVCPD].

Perichondritis is an **inflammation of the perichondrium**, most often affecting the auricle and sparing the earlobe [^117V6nXF]. It is usually caused by **trauma, piercings, or surgery**, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa as the most common pathogen [^113AVCPD]. Clinically, it presents with erythema, swelling, tenderness, and sometimes purulent discharge; if untreated, it can progress to **cartilage necrosis and cauliflower ear deformity** [^111tSnhM]. Diagnosis is clinical, with imaging reserved for complications [^117TcAWZ]. Management requires prompt antibiotics with antipseudomonal coverage (e.g. fluoroquinolones) [^117DbwAm], and surgical drainage or debridement if abscess or necrosis is present [^117V6nXF], and **early treatment is essential to prevent permanent deformity** [^117V6nXF].

---

## Etiology and risk factors

The most common **etiologies and risk factors** include:

- **Trauma**: Blunt or penetrating trauma to the auricle, including sports injuries and accidents [^111tSnhM].

- **Piercings**: High ear cartilage piercings [^116jcKsu] significantly increase the risk of perichondritis [^113AVCPD].

- **Surgical procedures**: Manipulation of auricular cartilage during surgical procedures, such as Mohs reconstructions, can lead to perichondritis [^115WsPJV].

- **Infections**: Bacterial infections, particularly by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, are common causative agents [^113AVCPD].

- **Systemic conditions**: Immunocompromised states, such as diabetes mellitus, increase susceptibility to perichondritis [^117DbwAm] [^1156E45q].

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical **clinical features** include:

- **Erythema and swelling**: Redness and swelling of the affected cartilage, sparing the earlobe [^113AVCPD].

- **Pain and tenderness**: Significant pain and tenderness upon palpation.

- **Purulent discharge**: In severe cases, purulent discharge may be present [^117V6nXF].

- **Cartilage deformity**: If untreated, chronic inflammation can lead to cartilage necrosis and deformity, commonly known as "cauliflower ear" [^111tSnhM].

---

## Diagnostic methods

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, based on the history and physical examination. Imaging studies, such as ultrasound or MRI, may be used in complicated cases to assess the extent of cartilage involvement or abscess formation [^117TcAWZ].

---

## Treatment strategies

Effective management involves **prompt initiation of antibiotic therapy** and surgical intervention for severe cases:

- **Antibiotic therapy**: Empirical antibiotic treatment targeting Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus is essential [^113AVCPD]. Fluoroquinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin) are commonly used due to their effectiveness against Pseudomonas species [^117DbwAm].

- **Surgical intervention**: In cases of abscess formation or cartilage necrosis, surgical drainage and debridement are necessary to prevent permanent deformity [^117V6nXF].

- **Supportive care**: Analgesics and anti-inflammatory medications may be used to manage pain and inflammation.

---

## Potential complications

Untreated perichondritis can lead to **cartilage necrosis**, with cartilage destruction and **permanent deformity** [^117V6nXF]. It may also cause cauliflower ear due to chronic inflammation and fibrosis [^111tSnhM]. Chronic infection can occur, necessitating prolonged antibiotic therapy and possible surgical intervention.

---

## Prevention

Prevention focuses on **minimizing auricular trauma** by using protective gear during sports and handling the auricle carefully. Safe piercing with sterile technique and diligent aftercare reduces infection risk [^116jcKsu]. Prompt treatment of auricular hematomas and infections helps prevent progression to perichondritis [^111tSnhM].

Perichondritis is an inflammation of the perichondrium, most commonly affecting the auricle [^117V6nXF]. It is often caused by trauma, piercings, or infections, particularly by Pseudomonas aeruginosa [^113AVCPD]. Prompt **antibiotic treatment** and **surgical intervention** in severe cases are essential to prevent complications such as cartilage necrosis and cauliflower ear deformity [^111tSnhM].

## References

### Surgery as a last resort for persistent auricular perichondritis [^117V6nXF]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Auricular perichondritis is a severe bacterial inflammation of the cartilaginous part of the external ear, sparing the lobule and the tragus. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are necessary to avoid necrosis of the underlying cartilage and permanent auricular deformity. Management includes antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Occasionally, surgery is required to control the inflammation. Wide cartilage and subcutaneous tissue debridement, with preservation of the helical rim to minimize the resulting auricular deformity, is necessary.

### Managing auricular hematoma: An emergency medicine narrative review [^111tSnhM]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Auricular hematoma is a condition commonly seen in the emergency department among patients presenting with trauma to the ear. It may result in several complications, such as perichondritis and cauliflower ear, if not managed appropriately.

This narrative review provides an evidence-based summary of the evaluation and management of auricular hematoma. Auricular hematoma is most commonly associated with shearing or blunt trauma to the ear, resulting in the formation of a hematoma within the subperichondrial space. This hematoma obstructs the nutrient supply from the perichondrium to the avascular cartilage. Without a nutrient supply, the ear is at risk for infection, necrosis, and fibrocartilaginous deposition causing cauliflower ear.

If a fluctuant hematoma is present within the cartilaginous auricle within 7 days of injury, evacuation should be offered. Prior to the procedure, analgesia should be performed using an auricular block. The hematoma can then be evacuated via needle aspiration or incision and drainage, followed by a bolster compression dressing to prevent the reaccumulation of blood within this potential space. Despite limited data, 7–10 days of antibiotics are currently recommended with coverage for *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* (e.g. fluoroquinolones in adults, amoxicillin-clavulanate in children). This may mitigate the risk of perichondritis. Patients should be reevaluated at 24–48 hours and abstain from contact sports for at least 2 weeks.

Emergency clinicians must be knowledgeable regarding the evaluation and management of auricular hematoma to prevent complications effectively.

### Auricular perichondritis in the cartilage piercing era [^113AVCPD]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Low credibility.

To describe the demographics, clinical presentation, treatment, and complications of piercing-induced auricular perichondritis (P-IAP) and non-PIAP, we reviewed the medical records of consecutive patients diagnosed and treated for P-IAP and P-FAP between 2006 and 2021. The retrieved data included demographics, comorbidities, etiology, location, treatment, complications, and outcome, and were compared between the two groups.

In total, 217 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Among them, 120 (55.3%) comprised the P-IAP group, characterized by significantly younger age and fewer comorbidities. The 97 non-PIAP patients tended to present with more systemic and regional signs, while the P-IAP group presented with localized signs and significantly more abscess formation and colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Time from causative event to symptom onset was significantly shorter in the P-IAP group (18.9 ± 38.7 days) compared to the non-PIAP group (29.8 ± 62.9 days, p < 21 days of antibiotic treatment, or requirement of a central line). Abscess formation was the most significant variable associated with complications (OR 35.75 [95% CI: 13.12–97.35, p < 0.001] for the entire cohort, OR 35.59 [95% CI: 10.84–116.84, p < 0.001] for the P-IAP group, and OR 47.30 [95% CI: 5.33–419.67, p = 0.001] for the non-PIAP group). No other variables reached a level of significance.

### Long-term outcomes of pericardiectomy for constrictive pericarditis [^114Z7oAp]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on constrictive pericarditis:

- **Definition**: Constrictive pericarditis is a chronic disease characterized by symptoms of fluid overload, progressive reduction in cardiac output, and congestive heart failure (HF).

- **Pathophysiology**: Constrictive pericarditis is caused by fibrous thickening of the pericardium due to idiopathic reasons, prior cardiac surgery, post-radiotherapy, post-infection (tuberculosis and non-tuberculous bacterial infection), connective tissue disease, malignancy, uremia, and sarcoidosis.

- **Disease course**: Chronic fibrous thickening of the pericardium due to various infectious and non-infectious causes results in constrictive pericarditis, which leads to clinical manifestations such as dyspnea, peripheral edema, chest pain, palpitations, abdominal distension, fever, fatigue, weight loss, jugular venous distension, pulsus paradoxus, hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, Kussmaul's sign, and pericardial shock.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: In-hospital mortality associated with constrictive pericarditis is 2.1%.

### External and middle ear diseases: Radiological diagnosis based on clinical signs and symptoms [^113odNCo]. Insights into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Non-traumatic opacified middle ear is characterized by chronic inflammation or infection. When the inflammation persists for at least 6 weeks and is associated with otorrhea through a perforated tympanic membrane, chronic otitis media (COM) is diagnosed.

- **Symptoms**: These include conductive hearing loss, sometimes pain, vertigo, and otorrhea.

Many patients with COM will undergo diagnostic imaging studies. Among the main indications are:

- **Long-standing inflammation**: Unresponsive to medical treatment.
- **Evaluation of possible causes of conductive hearing loss**: Such as ossicle erosion or fixation.
- **Clinical suspicion of cholesteatoma**.
- **Suspected intratemporal complications**: Such as petrositis, labyrinthitis, subperiosteal abscess, and labyrinthine fistula.
- **Suspected intracranial complications**: Such as brain abscess and meningitis.

- **Preferable imaging methods**: Both CT and MRI are used in the evaluation of COM and its complications. HRCT is the best tool to evaluate the ossicular chain and tympanic cavity walls. However, CT is unable to differentiate between different types of effusions in the tympanic cavity. Evaluation of cholesteatoma can also be challenging. MRI plays a role in the detection of primary and residual cholesteatoma, especially when intracranial and some intratemporal complications are suspected.

Since some ears with chronic inflammation develop cholesteatoma, COM may be classified into two groups: with or without cholesteatoma.

### Proceedings of the 31st European Paediatric Rheumatology Congress: part 2 [^113TKqD7]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis syndrome (CACP) is a rare genetic condition characterized by the development of progressive severe arthropathy, coxa vara, and noninflammatory serositis from early childhood. It is often initially misdiagnosed as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). However, the synovial changes in CACP result from impaired synthesis of lubricin (proteoglycan 4, PRG4), whose physiological function is the lubrication of the joint. The arthropathy in CACP is considered non-inflammatory and often does not improve with anti-inflammatory treatment or immune modulation.

- **Objectives**: To share with the pediatric rheumatology community our experience with a unique case of CACP in a 16-year-old girl.

- **Methods**: Case presentation.

- **Results**: We present the case of a 16-year-old Arab female referred to our clinic because of an abnormal hand MRI suggesting severe chronic inflammatory arthropathy of both hands and flexion deformities of all fingers. The initial signs of arthropathy were noted during her first three months of life. She had minimal joint pain complaints despite significant swelling of multiple joints. She experienced functional impairment from camptodactyly and chronic arthropathy of her wrists and underwent tendon release surgery twice for trigger fingers. There was a family history of consanguinity, autoimmune thyroiditis, Crohn's disease, and similar arthropathy in her first-degree relatives. Laboratory results showed positive ANA at 1:1280 and elevated serum IgG at 1.61 g/L.

### The incidences of chondritis and perichondritis associated with the surgical manipulation of auricular cartilage [^115WsPJV]. Dermatologic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The cartilage and soft tissues of the ear are frequently employed as donor sites for tissue used in the repair of defects of the nose and external ear after Mohs surgery. Enthusiasm for using these auricular donor sites is occasionally tempered by surgeons' concerns for the development of Pseudomonal suppurative chondritis, a complication that has been described to follow cartilage manipulation.

- **Objective**: To quantify the incidence of postoperative perichondritis and chondritis after Mohs reconstructions involving auricular cartilage manipulations.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed 341 Mohs reconstructions that involved cartilage and soft-tissue donor sites located on the ear. Procedures included full-thickness skin grafts (295) harvested from the conchal bowl and flap repairs (46) incorporating cartilage batten grafts from conchal or anthelix donor sites. When the perichondrium was compromised, patients were routinely prescribed perioperative prophylactic antibiotics with Pseudomonal coverage. Postoperative examinations were performed at 1 week and 4 to 12 weeks. Patients not seen in clinic were interviewed by telephone regarding complications.

- **Results**: Complete follow-up information was obtained in 337 of 341 (98.8%) cases. Inflammatory perichondritis was observed in 19 (5.6%) patients. There were no cases of suppurative chondritis.

- **Conclusion**: The incidence of inflammatory perichondritis is low after Mohs reconstructions involving auricular cartilage manipulation. When prophylactic antibiotics and appropriate operative technique are used, the historic concerns regarding this complication are minimal.

### A rare case of endochondral pseudocyst of the auricle [^117NmGp2]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Endochondral pseudocyst of the auricle is a very rare, benign, non-inflammatory cystic lesion. It most commonly develops in the scaphoid or triangular fossa of the ear. In this case report, we present a 46-year-old man with a painless lesion on the scaphoid fossa of the right ear. We removed the hypertrophic perichondrium forming the anterior wall of the pseudocyst, curetted the ear cartilage, and dressed it with compression. No complications, such as infection, seroma, or hematoma, occurred during the postoperative period. A good cosmetic result was ultimately obtained. The patient experienced no recurrence within a 14-month follow-up period.

### Relapsing polychondritis: State of the art on clinical practice guidelines [^1159hDsr]. RMD Open (2018). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for relapsing polychondritis, specifically in the context of auricular or nasal chondritis, the ERN ReCONNET 2018 guidelines recommend offering NSAIDs and corticosteroids to patients with nasal or auricular chondritis. They also advise considering colchicine, dapsone, methotrexate, or other conventional immunosuppressive agents or biologics for patients with relapsing disease.

### Monogenic disorders as mimics of juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^114m9XrU]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is the most common chronic rheumatic disease of childhood. The term JIA encompasses a heterogeneous group of diseases. The variability in the phenotype of patients affected by the disease means it is not uncommon for mimics of JIA to be misdiagnosed.

- **Case presentation**: We present four cases who were treated in a single tertiary rheumatology center for JIA, who were subsequently diagnosed with a rare monogenic disease. All four patients shared the unifying features of presenting in early childhood and subsequently suffered from refractory disease, not amenable to usual standards of treatment. Multicentric Carpotarsal Osteolysis Syndrome and Camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis syndrome are non-inflammatory conditions, and patients typically present with arthropathy, normal inflammatory markers, and atypical radiological features. Blau syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition, and patients will typically have symmetrical joint involvement with a strong family history of arthritis, signifying the genetic etiology.

- **Conclusions**: We share our learning from these cases to add to the growing portfolio of JIA mimics and to highlight when to consider an alternative diagnosis. In cases of refractory disease and diagnostic uncertainty, further imaging and genetic testing can play a crucial role in establishing the etiology. In all of these cases, the correct diagnosis was made due to careful, longitudinal clinical phenotyping and a close working relationship between rheumatology, radiology, and clinical genetics; highlighting the importance.

### Colcrys [^113hRJ4c]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The clinical studies provide substantial evidence for the efficacy of colchicine in patients with chronic gout. This evidence is derived from the published literature, including two randomized clinical trials that evaluated colchicine 0.6 mg administered twice daily for the prophylaxis of gout flares in patients starting urate-lowering therapy. In both trials, colchicine effectively reduced the frequency of gout flares.

Furthermore, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, one-week dose-comparison study assessed the efficacy of a low-dosage regimen of oral colchicine (COLCRYS total dose 1.8 mg over one hour) for treating gout flares. Patients meeting the American College of Rheumatology criteria for gout were randomly assigned to three groups:

- **High-dose colchicine**: 1.2 mg, followed by 0.6 mg hourly for six hours (4.8 mg total).
- **Low-dose colchicine**: 1.2 mg, followed by 0.6 mg in one hour (1.8 mg total) and five placebo doses hourly.
- **Placebo group**: Two capsules initially, followed by one capsule hourly for six hours.

Patients took the first dose within 12 hours of flare onset, recording pain intensity on an 11-point Likert scale and adverse events over 72 hours. The efficacy of colchicine was measured by the response in the target joint, using patient self-assessment of pain at 24 hours after administration of the first dose, as recorded in a diary. A responder was defined as a patient who achieved at least a 50% reduction in pain score at the 24-hour post-dose assessment relative to the pretreatment score, without using rescue medication before the 24-hour post-dose time.

### 2022 ESC guidelines on cardio-oncology developed in collaboration with the European Hematology Association (EHA), the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ESTRO) and the International Cardio-Oncology Society (IC-OS) [^111zbz1F]. European Heart Journal. Cardiovascular Imaging (2022). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute pericarditis, particularly concerning patients with radiation pericarditis, the EHA/ESC/ESTRO/IC-OS 2022 guidelines recommend considering echocardiography surveillance every five years. This is advised for patients who have developed acute pericarditis during radiotherapy to a volume that includes the heart, as these patients are at higher risk of developing chronic constrictive pericarditis.

### Joint chondrolysis [^11799CFy]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2011). Low credibility.

Although the disease was first described in the hip, reports of chondrolysis in nearly all diarthrodial joints have since emerged, with considerable variations in the literature. Despite speculation among clinicians and researchers about the implicit causal pathways and etiologic contributors associated with chondrolysis, definitive answers remain elusive. The term chondrolysis has been applied to varied levels of joint cartilage destruction, from focal chondral defects to diffuse cartilage loss, revealing a lack of consistency in the application of diagnostic criteria to guide differential disease classification. Differentiating between the various potential etiologies associated with chondrolysis provides opportunities for the prevention of the disease.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute pericarditis, more specifically with respect to patients with chemotherapy-induced pericarditis, the EHA/ESC/ESTRO/IC-OS 2022 guidelines recommend diagnosing and managing acute pericarditis in patients with cancer according to published guidelines for the diagnosis and management of pericardial diseases. Arrange a multidisciplinary discussion before interrupting cancer therapy.

### A case to hear: Ears hard as rock [^117FmXqi]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Answers:

- **Relapsing polychondritis**: Incorrect. Relapsing polychondritis is a rare autoimmune condition characterized by inflammation of the auricular, articular, nasal, and tracheal cartilage. Auricular involvement is present in 90% of cases and often presents with discoloration and pain, sparing the ear lobes. Our patient's lack of ear inflammation, symptoms, and imaging findings are not consistent with this diagnosis.

- **Cauliflower ear deformity**: Incorrect. Cauliflower ear deformity is due to hematoma formation within the outer ear after mechanical trauma. If not evacuated, the hematoma can disrupt the blood supply to the auricular cartilage, leading to necrosis, inflammation, and fibrocartilaginous overgrowth. Ear examination will show contour irregularity and swelling. A history will often reveal recent blunt trauma.

- **Tophaceous gout**: Incorrect. Tophaceous gout results in tophi — tissue deposits of monosodium urate crystals associated with granulomatous inflammation. They present as hard, chalky, yellow-white papules and nodules, commonly on the joints of the hands and feet but can present on the helical rim and antihelix of the ears. Risk factors include age, male sex, postmenopausal status, immunosuppressive agents, and myeloproliferative disease.

- **Petrified ears**: Correct. Petrified ears are a clinical entity which describe auricular cartilage hardening due to ectopic calcification or ossification. Many causes have been reported, including frostbite, local trauma, inflammation, and endocrine disorders, particularly adrenal insufficiency.

### Bone within a bone [^116ZXowV]. Clinical Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

The "bone within a bone" appearance is a well-recognized radiological term with a variety of causes. It is important to recognize this appearance and to be aware of the differential diagnosis. A number of common conditions infrequently cause this appearance. Other causes are rare, and some remain primarily of historical interest, as they are no longer encountered in clinical practice. In this review, we illustrate some of the conditions that can give the bone within a bone appearance and discuss the physiological and pathological aetiology of each, where known.

### Ofloxacin [^113A8jH6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

It is very important to use the ear drops for as long as the doctor has instructed, even if the symptoms improve. If ofloxacin otic solution ear drops are not used for as long as the doctor has instructed, the infection may be more likely to return.

- **Missed dose**: In patients with an ear canal infection ("swimmer's ear"), it is important that you take the drops every day. If you miss a dose, which may have been scheduled for earlier in the day (for example, 8 AM), you should take that day's dose as soon as possible and then return to your regular daily dosing schedule. In patients with a middle ear infection, if a dose of ofloxacin otic solution is missed, it should be given as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and return to the regular dosing schedule. Do not use a double dose unless the doctor has instructed you to do so. If the infection is not improved after one week, you should consult your doctor. If you have two or more episodes of drainage within six months, it is recommended that you see your doctor for further evaluation.

- **Activities to avoid**: It is important that the infected ear(s) remain clean and dry. When bathing, avoid getting the infected ear(s) wet. Avoid swimming unless the doctor has instructed otherwise.

### Relapsing polychondritis: A review and guide for the dermatologist [^115FYUvi]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Relapsing polychondritis, or RP, is a rare connective tissue disease characterized by relapsing-remitting destructive inflammation of the cartilaginous and other proteoglycan-rich structures in the body. Given the relatively low incidence of RP, a concise clinically relevant guide, focusing on the cutaneous manifestations of this serious disease, is lacking. In this review, we provide the dermatologist with an approach to diagnosing RP and a guide to its initial work-up and management. We close with an overview of the currently available treatment modalities for RP.

### Diagnosis of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition disease by ultrasonography: How many and which sites should be scanned [^111H23Mh]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Each participant underwent a systematic, bilateral, and multiplanar ultrasound examination of the following joints: shoulders, elbows, wrists, metacarpophalangeal joints, hips, knees, ankles, and feet. A total of 22 anatomical targets, which included nine hyaline cartilages, six fibrocartilages, five tendons, one joint capsule, and one ligament, were scanned bilaterally in each patient:

- **Shoulder**: Glenoid fibrocartilage, humeral hyaline cartilage, and acromioclavicular fibrocartilage.
- **Elbow**: Humeral hyaline cartilage and triceps tendon.
- **Wrist**: Triangular fibrocartilage, dorsal part of the scapho-lunate ligament, and volar capsule of the radio-lunate joint.
- **Hand**: Hyaline cartilage of the metacarpophalangeal joints from the second to fifth finger.
- **Hip**: Acetabular fibrocartilage and femoral hyaline cartilage.
- **Knee**: Femoral condyles' hyaline cartilage, meniscal fibrocartilages, patellar, and quadriceps tendons.
- **Ankle/Foot**: Talar hyaline cartilage, Achilles tendon, and plantar fascia.

Supplementary Table S1 (available at Rheumatology online) provides a detailed description of the scanning protocol based on the 2017 EULAR standardized procedures for ultrasound imaging in rheumatology.

The grey scale setting parameters were not standardized; they were manually adapted to enhance the recognition of calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal deposits as recommended. CPP crystal deposition, located within hyaline cartilages, fibrocartilages, tendons, and ligaments, was defined according to the Outcome Measure in Rheumatology (OMERACT) definitions (see Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary Data S1, available at Rheumatology online). It was scored in a binary fashion.

### Development of simple clinical criteria for the definition of inflammatory arthritis, enthesitis, dactylitis, and spondylitis: A report from the GRAPPA 2012 annual meeting [^114SrjnM]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Dermatologists and primary care clinicians are in an ideal position to identify the emergence of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in patients with psoriasis. Yet, these clinicians are not well-trained to distinguish inflammatory musculoskeletal disease from other more common problems such as osteoarthritis, traumatic or degenerative tendonitis and back pain, or fibromyalgia. A simple set of clinical criteria to identify inflammatory disease would aid in the recognition of PsA.

At its 2012 annual meeting, the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) discussed the development of evidence-based, practical, and reliable definitions of inflammatory arthritis, enthesitis, dactylitis, and spondylitis. This project will involve a sequential process of expert clinician nominal-group technique, patient surveys and focus groups, and Delphi exercises to identify core features of inflammatory disease. These features will be tested in a small group of patients with and without inflammatory disease, and finally, the criteria will be validated in larger groups of patients.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute pericarditis, specifically with respect to cardiac MRI/CT, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend considering obtaining non-contrast or contrast cardiac CT. This helps determine the presence and degree of pericardial thickening in patients with acute chest pain with suspected acute pericarditis.

### On defining musculoskeletal inflammation: A report from the GRAPPA 2011 annual meeting [^1136NyfD]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

At the 2011 annual meeting of the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA), members discussed the need to develop a framework for defining inflammatory arthritis, enthesitis, dactylitis, and spondylitis, particularly as they relate to psoriatic arthritis (PsA). GRAPPA members first addressed this subject at their 2010 meeting, where the CASPAR (Classification of Psoriatic Arthritis) criteria were discussed. Although these are classification criteria, the CASPAR are also often applied as a diagnostic measure by clinicians screening for PsA, particularly its core criterion: recognizing the presence of inflammatory musculoskeletal disease. In breakout group discussions, GRAPPA members discussed the difficulties in recognizing overlapping or mimicking features that may result in underdiagnosing or misdiagnosing PsA.

### Costochondritis: Diagnosis and treatment [^11326LTh]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Costochondritis, an inflammation of the costochondral junctions of ribs or chondrosternal joints of the anterior chest wall, is a common condition seen in patients presenting to the physician's office and emergency department. Palpation of the affected chondrosternal joints of the chest wall elicits tenderness. Although costochondritis is usually self-limited and benign, it should be distinguished from other, more serious causes of chest pain. Coronary artery disease is present in 3 to 6 percent of adult patients with chest pain and chest wall tenderness to palpation.

History and physical examination of the chest that document reproducible pain by palpation over the costal cartilages are usually all that is needed to make the diagnosis in children, adolescents, and young adults. Patients older than 35 years, those with a history or risk of coronary artery disease, and any patient with cardiopulmonary symptoms should have an electrocardiograph and possibly a chest radiograph. Consider further testing to rule out cardiac causes if clinically indicated by age or cardiac risk status.

Clinical trials of treatment are lacking. Traditional practice is to treat with acetaminophen or anti-inflammatory medications where safe and appropriate, advise patients to avoid activities that produce chest muscle overuse, and provide reassurance.

### Classification vs diagnostic criteria: The challenge of diagnosing axial spondyloarthritis [^112U8SuV]. Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

Good response to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

NSAIDs are considered the first-line therapy in patients diagnosed with axial SpA due to their strong effect on main symptoms, such as back pain and stiffness, as confirmed in numerous clinical trials. The usual definition of a good response to NSAIDs is included in the classification criteria: 24–48 hours following a full dose of an NSAID, back pain is either absent or significantly improved. A good response to NSAIDs is often considered in the context of inflammatory back pain, and it is expected that inflammatory back pain related to axial SpA increases the likelihood of a good treatment response to anti-inflammatory therapy.

- **Peripheral manifestations (arthritis, enthesitis, dactylitis)**: In contrast to rheumatoid arthritis, SpA-like arthritis is characterized by mono- or oligoarthritis predominantly involving the lower extremities, though polyarticular disease is also possible. Arthritis in SpA is generally non-erosive and is considered secondary to enthesitis in SpA. The frequency of peripheral arthritis in SpA ranges significantly (26–62%) and appears more common in the South American population compared to the European one. Hip joint involvement (coxitis) is often categorized as axial rather than peripheral disease. In contrast to other forms of SpA-associated peripheral arthritis, it may have a severe destructive course and is frequently linked with a younger age of disease onset and more severe axial disease.

### Calcium deposits in the hand and wrist [^1161Y1s1]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Calcium, or calcific, deposition disease in the form of acute calcific periarthritis of the hand and wrist is an uncommon entity that may be confused with more common crystalline or inflammatory arthropathies as well as infection. It is important for the clinician to be aware of this disease process and to include it in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with acutely painful, focal inflammation of the hand or wrist. Nonsurgical management is often sufficient; however, considering the self-limited nature of the disease, accurate diagnosis is essential to avoid unnecessary antibiotic or surgical treatment.

In the context of acute pericarditis, particularly among patients with chemotherapy-induced pericarditis, the 2022 EHA/ESC/ESTRO/IC-OS guidelines suggest the consideration of a surgical pericardial window if a percutaneous approach is not feasible or in cases of malignant pericardial effusions. Additionally, intrapericardial instillation of cytostatic or sclerosing agents should be considered to prevent recurrence.

### Uncommon CT findings in relapsing polychondritis [^114Yx1kX]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2005). Low credibility.

Relapsing polychondritis is a rare inflammatory disorder of cartilage with well-established clinical features and imaging characteristics. Abnormal calcification and erosion of cartilaginous structures are the traditional radiographic findings. As with any disease, aberrancies of the expected clinical presentation may lead to a delayed (or missed) diagnosis. We discuss a rare case of relapsing polychondritis in which the diagnosis was suggested on the basis of CT findings, despite uncharacteristic clinical and radiographic manifestations of the disease.

### Kinesin-1 promotes chondrocyte maintenance during skeletal morphogenesis [^115soeDc]. PLoS Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

Intramembranous ossification, the formation of bone within connective tissue, and endochondral or perichondral ossification, the formation of bone via mineralization and reabsorption of cartilage anlage (endochondral) or mineralization around a persisting cartilage scaffold (perichondral), serve as templates for later bone formation. Additionally, apoptotic remodeling of unmineralized cartilage contributes to skeletal tissue morphogenesis.

The zebrafish jaw is a genetically tractable system to investigate the molecular and genetic basis of cartilage and bone morphogenesis. During morphogenesis, the chondrocytes of long bones, endochondral or perichondral bones in teleost fish, including those in the jaw, elongate and orient their primary cilia and microtubule organizing centers (MTOC). Through oriented intercalation, the discoid cells align in a stacked configuration. Disruption of Wnt Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) genes, pipetail (wnt5b) and knypek (gpc4), or Fat/Dachsous depletion disrupts cartilage cell polarity and stacking.

Mutations in vesicular trafficking machinery components impair cellular secretion and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. In some cases, this leads to ER stress response activation and disrupts chondrogenesis. Although unmineralized cartilage remodels via conserved PCP-mediated polarization and cell rearrangements, the mechanisms that maintain the chondrocyte template supporting perichondral ossification remain unclear.

### Laryngeal perichondritis: Unexpected diagnosis [^117DbwAm]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

A 57-year-old male chronic smoker with underlying diabetes mellitus presented with dysphonia associated with cough, dysphagia, and reduced effort tolerance of three months' duration. Videoendoscope findings revealed bilateral polypoidal and erythematous true and false vocal folds with a small glottic airway. The patient was initially treated as having tuberculous laryngitis and started on antituberculous drugs; however, no improvement was observed. A CT scan of the neck showed erosion of thyroid cartilage, which suggested laryngeal carcinoma as a differential diagnosis. Nevertheless, the erosion was more diffuse and appeared systemic in origin. The diagnosis of laryngeal perichondritis was made when the histopathological examination revealed features of inflammation, and the tracheal aspirate isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The patient made a good recovery following treatment with oral ciprofloxacin.

### Relapsing polychondritis [^1165D8uQ]. Clinics in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Relapsing polychondritis is a rare disease most commonly presenting as inflammation of the cartilage of the ears and nose. Auricular chondritis, with red ears resembling infectious cellulitis, is the most common initial finding. Antibodies to type II collagen in cartilage are found, and the earlobes are classically spared.

Chronic disease may result in a flabby, droopy ear, cauliflower ear, or saddle nose deformity. Acute involvement of the tracheal cartilage may cause collapse of the airway with obstruction and pulmonary infections. Arthritis may be oligoarticular or polyarticular, most often involving the costochondral junctions.

Other manifestations include audiovestibular damage; heart valve disease; and neurologic, ocular, and renal disease. Corticosteroids remain the major treatment. Other therapies include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, dapsone, colchicine, azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, hydroxychloroquine, cyclosporine, and infliximab.

### Enthesitis in psoriatic arthritis (part 2): Imaging [^112w6JtX]. Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

High-resolution peripheral quantitative CT imaging for entheses has shown promise, despite the limitations of plain radiography. There has been considerable interest in characterizing bone formation, particularly at entheseal sites around small joints. High-resolution peripheral quantitative CT can visualize bone microstructure in great detail and has been validated in osteoporosis research.

In a study involving 30 PsA patients compared with 58 RA patients, high-resolution CT (HRCT) of the hand demonstrated differences in erosion morphology between the two groups. Additionally, a higher number of 'osteophytes' were observed in the PsA group, which seemed to surround the entire bone circumference as a corona. A subsequent study by the same authors used HRCT to examine 25 PsA patients compared with 25 patients with hand OA and 20 healthy controls. HRCT of the dominant hand revealed that patients with PsA and OA had similar numbers of bone spurs. However, the location of bone formation in PsA patients was primarily at the radial aspect of the second MCP joint, whereas patients with OA had a predominance of bone formation on the dorsal and palmar aspects. Anatomic correlation suggested that bone formation in PsA subjects was prominent in the entheseal regions, while subjects with hand OA had bone spurs at the cartilage–bone margin and the joint margins.

Interestingly, HRCT was used to examine 55 psoriasis patients without musculoskeletal complaints and 47 healthy volunteers. More enthesophytes were found in psoriasis patients compared with controls. These tended to be larger and occur on the dorsal and palmar surfaces of the metacarpals.

### Prevalence of arthritis — United States, 1997 [^111kyQYc]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2001). Low credibility.

Arthritis and other rheumatic conditions (i.e. arthritis) are among the most prevalent diseases in the United States and are the most frequent cause of disability. In 1985, an estimated 35 million persons were affected by arthritis; in 1990, a study using a broader arthritis definition estimated that 38 million were affected. To better characterize these conditions, the CDC analyzed a variety of data for 1997 using common definitions from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM).

The findings of one such analysis in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) indicated that, in 1997, the prevalence of persons with arthritis had increased by approximately 750,000 per year since 1990. Findings also support earlier projections that by 2020, 60 million persons may be affected by arthritis and that the activities of 11.6 million persons may be limited by arthritis. More widespread implementation of existing interventions may reduce the occurrence and progression of arthritis.

### Definitions for the sonographic features of joints in healthy children [^112cPsew]. Arthritis Care & Research (2015). Low credibility.

Musculoskeletal ultrasonography (US) has potential in the assessment of disease activity and structural damage in childhood arthritides. To assess pathology, the US characteristics of joints in healthy children need to be defined first. The aim of this study was to develop definitions for the various components of the normal pediatric joint.

- **Methods**: The definitions were developed by an expert group and applicability was assessed on a collection of standardized scans of the knee and ankle joints by scoring the scans on a Likert scale. The definitions were then modified and applicability was reassessed before sending the definitions for approval to a larger panel of experts. A final scoring on stored images of all relevant joints at different ages followed.

- **Results**: Five definitions were developed addressing the articular bone, cartilage, joint capsule, epiphyseal ossification center, and synovial membrane. In total, 224 US images of knees and ankles were acquired, of which 172 were selected for scoring. An agreement of ≥ 80% was not met for any of the definitions, but after modifications, 81–97% agreement was reached. This version of the definitions was approved by 15 US experts. In the final validation exercise, all definitions reached an agreement of ≥ 80% for the shoulder, elbow, wrist, metacarpophalangeal, hip, knee, ankle, and metatarsophalangeal joint.

- **Conclusion**: US definitions for the normal pediatric joint were successfully developed through a Delphi process and validated in a practical exercise. These results provide the basis to develop definit

### A case of squamoid eccrine ductal carcinoma of the auricle mimicking perichondritis [^113dg3Cg]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2024). Low credibility.

The subtype of eccrine carcinoma known as squamoid eccrine ductal carcinoma (SEDC) is rare; only 38 cases, including only 6 cases in the ear, have been documented in the literature. This may be the first case to focus on the fact that SEDC, located within the dermal and subcutaneous layers, spares the epidermis histopathologically. This characteristic can cause clinicians to confuse SEDC with acute perichondritis.

### Prevalence of specific types of arthritis and other rheumatic conditions in the ambulatory health care system in the United States, 2001–2005 [^116fADWs]. Arthritis Care & Research (2010). Low credibility.

To estimate the overall prevalence of medically-treated arthritis and other rheumatic conditions (AORC) for adults, the prevalence of specific medically-treated conditions, and the overall annual number of visits for these conditions in the ambulatory health care system, data were used from the 2001–2005 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the 2001–2005 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. The surveys were designed to estimate annual ambulatory health care visits for the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes thought to represent AORC. Using data on the number of prior annual visits per patient per condition, visit estimates were converted into prevalence estimates of adults aged 18 years or older with medically-treated AORC overall and for specific conditions.

The results showed that the overall prevalence estimate of adults with medically-treated AORC was 29,150,000 adults (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 26,473,000–31,826,000), accounting for 77,887,300 ambulatory care visits (95% CI 71,266,000–84,508,000). The five most prevalent conditions identified were osteoarthritis and allied disorders, unspecified joint disorders, peripheral enthesopathies, unspecified arthropathies, and other disorders of synovium, tendon, or bursa.

The advantage of this approach is that it uses existing, rather than expensive new surveys, for tracking the prevalence of medically-treated AORC overall and tracking the prevalence of difficult-to-measure specific conditions. These estimates are data-based and national in scope. More relevantly, they provide a better understanding of the prevalence of these conditions.

### Relapsing polychondritis [^1164uB4N]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Relapsing polychondritis is a unique, rare autoimmune disorder in which the cartilaginous tissues are the primary targets of destruction. However, the immune damage can also spread to involve noncartilaginous tissues such as the kidneys and blood vessels. The manifestations of the disease can take many different forms, and its pathogenesis is still unclear. It may occur in a primary form or be associated with other disease states. This article summarizes important aspects of the disease, with a focus on recent information regarding clinical manifestations, disease associations, pathogenesis, and advances in therapeutics.

### Recurrent auricular perichondritis in a child as the initial manifestation of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus: A case report [^1156E45q]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2014). Low credibility.

An 8-year-old boy presented to our otolaryngology clinic three times in a 3-month period for treatment of acute auricular perichondritis. At each visit, he was treated with an antibiotic and responded quickly in each case, with a complete resolution of his infection. The results of standard autoimmune laboratory tests were negative. Three months after his initial presentation, the patient developed the classic signs and symptoms of diabetes mellitus, including polydipsia, polyuria, and weight loss. He was diagnosed with and treated for type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes, and his reinfections ceased. There has been no recurrence over a 4-year follow-up period.

This case report serves to illustrate that reinfections may be the first sign of diabetes. Since diabetes and perichondritis are known to be associated, we recommend that for patients who present with re-episodes of perichondritis, a basic metabolic panel and measurement of the glycosylated hemoglobin level be added to standard autoimmune laboratory testing to possibly identify undiagnosed diabetes.

- **Study population characteristics**: A total of 56 patients were analyzed in this study, with a predominance of 69.6% females and 30.4% males. The mean age of the patients was 38.18 ± 9.57 years. Clinical characteristics such as age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) were significantly similar between the study groups. However, compared with those in the control group, a significantly greater proportion of patients in the M-TAPA group underwent ASA 3 assessment (25% vs. 3.12%, p = 0.010).

- **Characteristics of the surgical event**: Surgical and anesthetic times were significantly longer in the M-TAPA group than in the control group (119.75 vs. 81.25, p = 0.0004 and 153.25 vs. 107.06, p = 0.0001, respectively). Additionally, there was a greater use of anesthetic adjuvants in the control group (8.33% vs. 78.12%, p = 0.0001), as well as increased opioid consumption (341.58 vs. 577.53, p = 0.0001).

- **M-TAPA**: Modified perichondral approach to thoracoabdominal nerve block

Atypical infections may manifest in the setting of low clinical suspicion and, due to similarities with other inflammatory conditions in their clinical and imaging findings, misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis is not infrequent. This delay can lead to an elevated risk of severe bone and joint destruction, and higher morbidity. This review addresses the challenging subject of discussing the imaging characteristics of atypical infections and a variety of inflammatory conditions of the hand. It emphasizes key points that assist in differentiating between the two broad clinical categories of infections versus inflammatory causes.

### External and middle ear diseases: Radiological diagnosis based on clinical signs and symptoms [^117TcAWZ]. Insights into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Pathology of the external and middle ear is the most frequent reason to prescribe antibiotics and perform surgery in children and young adults. In the majority of cases, imaging studies are not performed; the need for imaging arises when complications are suspected or when treatment is not effective. This paper discusses indications for temporal bone imaging studies and presents the most frequent pathological conditions, together with differential diagnosis, clinical symptoms, and methods of treatment.

- **Objective**: Pathology of the external and middle ear is the principal reason for prescribing antibiotics and performing surgery in children and young adults. Imaging studies are typically not conducted unless complications are suspected or treatment is ineffective. This paper discusses temporal bone imaging study indications and presents frequent pathological conditions, differential diagnoses, clinical symptoms, and treatment methods.

- **Methods and Results**: This pictorial review describes major external and middle ear diseases, with special regard to clinical findings and appropriate reporting.

- **Conclusions**: Apprehension of the complete clinical picture, together with imaging clues, narrows differential diagnosis and helps avoid mistakes. Evaluation of temporal bone pathologies requires close cooperation between the clinician and radiologist.

### Monogenic disorders as mimics of juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^115QR5DA]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common chronic rheumatic disease of childhood. The term JIA encompasses a heterogeneous group of diseases. The variability in phenotype among patients affected by the disease means that it is not uncommon for mimics of JIA to be misdiagnosed.

- **Case presentation**: We present four cases treated in a single tertiary rheumatology center for JIA, who were subsequently diagnosed with a rare monogenic disease. All four patients shared the unifying features of presenting in early childhood and subsequently suffering from refractory disease not amenable to usual standards of treatment. Multicentric carpotarsal osteolysis syndrome and camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis syndrome are non-inflammatory conditions. Patients typically present with arthropathy, normal inflammatory markers, and atypical radiological features. Blau syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition where patients typically have symmetrical joint involvement with a strong family history of arthritis, signifying a genetic etiology.

- **Conclusions**: We share our learning from these cases to add to the growing portfolio of JIA mimics and to highlight when to consider an alternative diagnosis. In cases of refractory disease and diagnostic uncertainty, further imaging and genetic testing can play a crucial role in establishing the etiology. In all of these cases, the correct diagnosis was made due to careful longitudinal clinical phenotyping and a close working relationship between rheumatology, radiology, and clinical genetics, highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration.

### Acute calcific periarthritis of the hand and wrist: a series and review of the literature [^1136M8Qh]. Emergency Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

This article presents three patients with acute calcific periarthritis (ACP) of the hand and wrist. ACP is an unusual, painful, monoarticular, periarticular inflammatory process associated with juxtaarticular deposits of amorphous calcium hydroxyapatite. ACP is a distinct clinical subset of hydroxyapatite deposition disease. **High rate of misdiagnosis**: ACP has a high rate of misdiagnosis because of its rare occurrence and its clinical resemblance to other entities. Clinical presentation may simulate infection, and the associated periarticular calcifications may be mistaken for gout, pseudogout, or other entities. One third of patients with ACP provide a history of antecedent trauma.

- **Treatment**: Treatment is conservative. Patients typically will have a reduction in symptoms within 4–7 days after the acute onset of pain. Radiographically, the periarticular mineralization usually resolves or markedly decreases within 2–3 weeks, although on occasion, some calcifications may remain visible for months. Failure to recognize and correlate the typical clinical and radiographic presentation of this disease may lead to unnecessary diagnostic tests, invasive procedures, and inappropriate medication.

### A case to hear: Ears hard as rock [^11189kZS]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

- **Question 2**: This patient's condition is associated with which of the following?
	- A. Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 2
	- B. Nasal chondritis
	- C. Cutaneous vasculitis (may be seen with relapsing polychondritis)
	- D. Positive antiproteinase 3 (anti-PR3)
	- E. Myelodysplastic syndrome

- **Answers**:
	- A. Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 2 – Correct. Calcification of articular cartilage, or petrified ears, is associated with endocrinopathies such as autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 2 and adrenal insufficiency. Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 2 is characterized by at least two of the three following endocrinopathies: type 1 diabetes mellitus, autoimmune thyroiditis, and Addison's disease. Endocrinopathies have been reported to cause ectopic calcium deposition, but the mechanism is unknown. There is no standardized protocol for assessing patients with petrified ears; however, evaluation may include assessing for underlying thyroid, adrenal, and pituitary disorders. Our patient's lab work, including parathyroid hormone, phosphorus, glutamic acid decarboxylase, and procollagen type 1, to rule out other causes of ossification, was unremarkable.
	- B. Nasal chondritis – Incorrect. Nasal chondritis is a common sign of relapsing polychondritis. There is no association of petrified ears with nasal chondritis.
	- C. Cutaneous vasculitis (may be seen with relapsing polychondritis) – Incorrect. Petrified ears are not associated with cutaneous vasculitis.
	- D. Positive antiproteinase 3 (anti-PR3) – Incorrect. Antiproteinase 3 antibodies are associated with granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

### The need to define musculoskeletal inflammation: a report from the GRAPPA 2010 annual meeting [^114GUxtz]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a form of spondyloarthritis, a group of conditions that share a spectrum of components, including arthritis, enthesitis, dactylitis, and spine inflammation. In PsA, however, the unpredictable, heterogeneous, and often insidious involvement of joints or juxta-articular tendons and ligaments can sometimes make clinical recognition of the disease a challenge. Underrecognition of PsA may be due to the absence of a single sensitive and specific diagnostic measure. Although the Classification of Psoriatic Arthritis (CASPAR) criteria introduced in 2006 have improved disease classification, they are designed to be applied to cases already diagnosed with inflammatory arthritis. Therefore, in order for these criteria to be applied, the clinician is required to recognize the presence of inflammatory arthritis, enthesitis, or spondylitis.

At the 2010 annual meeting of GRAPPA (Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis), the need to define inflammatory arthritis, enthesitis, dactylitis, and spondylitis, especially for nonrheumatologists, was discussed. Conclusions from breakout group discussions are summarized.

### Silent tracheobronchial chondritis in a patient with a delayed diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis [^1163Q8YC]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Relapsing polychondritis is a very rare autoimmune disease characterized by relapsing inflammation of hyaline, elastic, and fibrous cartilaginous tissues. The incidence is estimated to be between 3.5 and 4.5 per million people per year. Clinical signs and symptoms can be very subtle, and if left undiagnosed for a prolonged period, airway involvement can cause fibrosis of the tracheobronchial wall, leading to a fixed tracheobronchial stenosis. Eventually, this can progress to life-threatening tracheobronchomalacia due to irreversible damage and loss of tissue integrity.

We report an elderly man who presented with bilateral ear inflammation and intermittent polyarthritis and was diagnosed with relapsing polychondritis, showing asymptomatic involvement of his large airways.

### Relapsing polychondritis: Clinical updates and new differential diagnoses [^1177iRmc]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Relapsing polychondritis is a rare inflammatory disease characterized by the inflammation of cartilaginous structures, primarily affecting the ears, nose, and respiratory tract, along with a broad spectrum of accompanying systemic features. Despite its rarity, prompt recognition and accurate diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis are crucial for appropriate management and optimal outcomes.

Our understanding of relapsing polychondritis has changed significantly in recent years with the identification of three distinct patient clusters that exhibit different clinical manifestations and prognostic outcomes. With advancements in pangenomic sequencing and the discovery of new somatic and monogenic autoinflammatory diseases, new differential diagnoses have emerged, notably the vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic (VEXAS) syndrome, as well as autoinflammatory diseases and immune checkpoint inhibitor-related adverse events.

In this review, we present a detailed update of the newly identified clusters and highlight red flags that should raise suspicion of these alternative diagnoses. The identification of these different clusters and mimickers has a direct impact on the management, follow-up, and prognosis of patients with relapsing polychondritis and autoinflammatory syndromes.

### Mutations in fam20b and xylt1 reveal that cartilage matrix controls timing of endochondral ossification by inhibiting chondrocyte maturation [^116ad7Xk]. PLoS Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

The observed increase in perichondral bone might result from three possible scenarios: 1) osteoblasts differentiate at the correct time but exhibit enhanced secretory activity; 2) osteoblasts differentiate at the correct time, but a larger pool of pre-osteoblasts exists in mutant perichondria; or 3) osteoblasts differentiate early. Examination of skeletal phenotypes and cellular and molecular markers of osteoblasts at time points prior to 6 dpf demonstrated that the increase in mutant perichondral bone resulted from early initiation of osteogenesis. While neither mutants nor wild types showed signs of perichondral bone at 3 dpf (Figure 9A–9C), Alizarin red staining was observed in chondral bones of fam20b and xylt1 mutants, but not wild types, at 4.5 dpf (Figure 9D–9F, arrows). Bone formation was not accelerated in time further in fam20b; xylt1 double mutants, as perichondral bone was not detected at 3 dpf, but was prominent by 4.5 dpf (data not shown).

To address the cellular basis for early perichondral bone, fam20b and xylt1 mutants were bred into transgenic zebrafish expressing EGFP under a promoter that is restricted to osteoblasts (Tg(sp7:EGFP)b1212). Transgenic mutants showed GFP expression and Alizarin red fluorescence in the perichondrium of chondral bones by 4.5 dpf, whereas their wild-type siblings showed neither of these markers at this time point (Figure 9G, 9H, arrows). Further support for the temporal shift in bone development came from similar analyses at 6 dpf, when wild types demonstrated levels of GFP and Alizarin red staining that were comparable.

### External and middle ear diseases: Radiological diagnosis based on clinical signs and symptoms [^116Yi4Nb]. Insights into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Pathology of the external and middle ear is the most frequent reason to prescribe antibiotics and perform surgery in children and young adults. In the majority of cases, imaging studies are not performed; the need for imaging arises when complications are suspected or when treatment is not effective. This paper discusses indications for temporal bone imaging studies and presents the most frequent pathological conditions, together with differential diagnosis, clinical symptoms, and methods of treatment.

- **Methods and results**: This pictorial review describes major external and middle ear diseases, with special regard to clinical findings and appropriate reporting.

- **Conclusions**: Apprehension of the complete clinical picture, together with imaging clues, narrows differential diagnosis and helps avoid mistakes. Evaluation of temporal bone pathologies requires close cooperation between the clinician and radiologist.

### 2022 ESC guidelines on cardio-oncology developed in collaboration with the European Hematology Association (EHA), the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ESTRO) and the International Cardio-Oncology Society (IC-OS) [^111gZyTr]. European Heart Journal: Cardiovascular Imaging (2022). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute pericarditis, more specifically with respect to patients with chemotherapy-induced pericarditis, the EHA/ESC/ESTRO/IC-OS 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining multimodality cardiovascular imaging (echocardiography, cardiac MRI, and CT), ECG, and measurement of cardiac biomarkers to confirm the diagnosis, assess the hemodynamic consequences of pericardial disease, and rule out associated myocarditis.

### Risk of autoimmune diseases in patients with COVID-19: A retrospective cohort study [^1164jaLt]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

The main outcomes of the study were newly diagnosed autoimmune diseases identified by the corresponding ICD-10 codes in the database. These diseases included rheumatoid arthritis (ICD-10 code M05-M06), ankylosing spondylitis (ICD-10 code M45), systemic lupus erythematosus (ICD-10 code M32), dermatopolymyositis (ICD-10 code M33), systemic sclerosis (ICD-10 code M34), Sjögren's syndrome (ICD-10 code M35.0), mixed connective tissue disease (ICD-10 code M35.1), Behçet's disease (ICD-10 code M35.2), polymyalgia rheumatica (ICD-10 code M35.3), vasculitis (ICD-10 code M30–31 or L95), psoriasis (ICD-10 code L40), inflammatory bowel disease (ICD-10 code K50–52), celiac disease (ICD-10 code K90.0), and type 1 diabetes mellitus (ICD-10 code E10).

To address competing risks, mortality was included as a secondary outcome. A 30-day timeframe was used as a washout period for the outcome measures to alleviate protopathic bias, which refers to increased vigilance and earlier diagnosis of an autoimmune disease following a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both cohorts were followed after 30 days from the index date up to 6 months to estimate the risks of incident autoimmune disease.

### The 2023 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease [^115RFeHk]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

Calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease is prevalent and has diverse presentations, but there are no validated classification criteria for this symptomatic arthritis. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and EULAR have developed the first-ever validated classification criteria for symptomatic CPPD disease.

Supported by the ACR and EULAR, a multinational group of investigators followed established methodology to develop these disease classification criteria. The group generated lists of candidate items and refined their definitions, collected de-identified patient profiles, evaluated strengths of associations between candidate items and CPPD disease, developed a classification criteria framework, and used multi-criterion decision analysis to define criteria weights and a classification threshold score. The criteria were validated in an independent cohort.

Among patients with joint pain, swelling, or tenderness (entry criterion) whose symptoms are not fully explained by an alternative disease (exclusion criterion), the presence of crowned dens syndrome or calcium pyrophosphate crystals in synovial fluid are sufficient to classify a patient as having CPPD disease. In the absence of these findings, a score > 56 points using weighted criteria — comprising clinical features, associated metabolic disorders, and results of laboratory and imaging investigations — can be used to classify as CPPD disease. These criteria had a sensitivity of 92.2% and specificity of 87.9% in the derivation cohort (190 CPPD cases, 148 mimickers).

### Relapsing polychondritis: A clinical review for rheumatologists [^111gJgUe]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Relapsing polychondritis (RPC) is a rare autoimmune rheumatic disorder traditionally classified as a systemic vasculitis. It is characterized by inflammation of cartilage, with typical presenting features including chondritis of the nasal bridge, auricular chondritis, ocular inflammation, and involvement of the bronchial tree. Its rarity often leads to considerable delays in establishing a diagnosis and poses significant management challenges to clinicians, as no conventional guidelines exist. This review summarizes the clinical features of RPC and provides guidance for rheumatologists on making the diagnosis and assessing organ involvement.

The state of RPC management is reviewed with a focus on the use of anti-TNF-α agents in patients with pulmonary involvement, the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in RPC.

### The auricular perichondrium sleeve (APS) for nasal dorsum refinement [^115PUWNj]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

During rhinoplasty, there is often a need to perform camouflage and aesthetic augmentation of the nasal dorsum. Some of the most well-studied methods include the use of deep temporal fascia and diced cartilage in fascia. Due to less trauma, taking the rectus abdominis fascia in combination with rib harvesting is becoming widespread. However, in cases where only camouflage or augmentation of the nasal dorsum is required, it is possible to avoid taking the rib and the mentioned fascia by using auricular materials successfully through a single incision.

- **Objectives**: The article describes the use of the auricular perichondral sleeve for camouflage and dorsal augmentation, both in empty conditions and when filled with auricular cartilage, in the modeling of diced cartilage auricular perichondral sleeve grafts.

- **Methods**: For camouflage and augmentation of the nasal dorsum in primary, post-traumatic, and secondary cases of rhinoplasty, both open and closed approaches were used. Auricular perichondrium was used in three conditions: (1) empty auricular perichondral sleeve, (2) full-length filled with diced auricular cartilage, and (3) partially filled sleeve. The techniques for applying these grafts were described depending on the clinical situation.

- **Results**: The authors report their experience with 122 clinical cases from February 2019 to March 2022. The patients were divided into three groups based on the types of grafts used.

- **Conclusion**: Autologous auricular perichondrium can be used for camouflage and dorsum augmentation in primary, post-traumatic, and secondary cases.

### Definition and classification of early osteoarthritis of the knee [^112oUBhR]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2012). Low credibility.

With the emerging interest in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering, new treatment modalities are being developed for joint disorders, including joint surface lesions and articular cartilage defects. The clinical outcome of these novel approaches appears rather unpredictable due to many reasons, but it is definitely also linked to patient profiles. For example, symptomatic articular cartilage lesions can present in an otherwise normal joint or be associated with several other joint tissue alterations, including meniscal lesions and abnormalities of the underlying bone. The outcome of novel treatments may be influenced by the status of the whole joint and the potential to develop osteoarthritis.

To better identify patients at risk and responders to certain treatments, it is useful to define and classify patients with "early osteoarthritis". Here, classification criteria for this group of patients are presented, allowing for a more defined and accurate inclusion in clinical trials in the future.

### External and middle ear diseases: Radiological diagnosis based on clinical signs and symptoms [^112ko4kV]. Insights into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Pathology of the external and middle ear is the third most common reason for visiting a general practitioner or family doctor. In children and teenagers, inflammatory conditions of the middle ear are the most frequent reasons to prescribe antibiotics and perform surgery.

In the majority of these cases, a proper diagnosis is made by clinical examination alone, and patients will not benefit from additional diagnostic imaging studies. However, the prevalence of ear infections increased significantly between 1980 and 1996, suggesting that the approach to preventing and treating middle ear inflammation is not adequate. Therefore, especially in complicated and recurrent conditions, imaging plays an important role; imaging findings may fundamentally influence the treatment.

In non-inflammatory conditions of the external and middle ear, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide a diagnosis and/or necessary information for surgery in a significant number of cases. Usually, patients with temporal bone pathology first undergo clinical examination, often with audiology tests. Information obtained this way, when combined with imaging findings, provides an accurate and trustworthy diagnosis, allowing for the avoidance of misinterpretation and ensuring appropriate treatment.

### ESCMID rapid guidelines for assessment and management of long COVID [^11492aXm]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). High credibility.

Regarding acute pericarditis, especially in patients with long COVID, the ESCMID 2022 guidelines recommend excluding other serious or life-threatening conditions. These include previously overlooked conditions such as malignancy and complications of acute COVID-19, like thromboembolic events, myopericarditis, and encephalitis, before diagnosing long COVID in symptomatic patients. Evaluation for other conditions should be guided by symptoms, signs, and other tests, according to the physician's discretion.

### External and middle ear diseases: Radiological diagnosis based on clinical signs and symptoms [^115dxUzg]. Insights into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

The middle ear is located behind the tympanic membrane, which makes direct non-invasive evaluation limited in many cases. Although the pathology itself can be well estimated through otoscopic examination, further questions concerning the extent of the disease, exact location, structures involved, and possible bone erosion are best addressed in detail with CT and/or MRI.

The majority of everyday practice cases involve inflammatory diseases, either chronic or acute, and sometimes tumors. On CT examination, these entities appear as a mass or a diffuse opacification of the middle ear cavity. Since an opacified middle ear is a common finding on imaging studies, a practical classification has been used to facilitate differential diagnosis.

### Kinesin-1 promotes chondrocyte maintenance during skeletal morphogenesis [^116cAReD]. PLOS Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

Because deficient proteoglycan (PG) secretion by chondrocytes can cause premature ossification due to precocious differentiation of perichondrium, we examined ossification at 6 days post-fertilization (dpf) using Alizarin Red. Compared to wild type (Wt) (Fig 3A), membranous ossification was apparent; however, kif5Blof mutants exhibited diminished perichondral ossification (Fig 3D). Bone collars (BC), which develop around Wt cartilage, were not evident in kif5Blof, although some mineralization was detectable. Significantly, perichondral ossification was not precocious, indicating that either the mutant extracellular matrix (ECM) contains sufficient PG or mutant perichondrium/osteoblasts are nonresponsive or dysfunctional. To distinguish between failed and delayed ossification, we examined bone formation at a later stage, 11 dpf. In Wt, membranous and perichondral ossification had progressed (Fig 3B), and vertebrae were apparent (Fig 3C). In kif5Blof, membranous ossification had also progressed (Fig 3E); for example, the dentary bone was thicker (compare Fig 3D and 3E), and vertebrae (Fig 3F) were apparent, although not completely normal. However, the bone collars were not detectable (Fig 3E), suggesting that the mutant cartilage template was unable to support ossification.

- **Impeded mineralization in kif5Blof**: Confocal projections of images of live embryos at 6 dpf (A, D) and 11 dpf (B, C, E, F) showed that GFP stained chondrocytes and Alizarin Red stained mineralized matrix. Intramembranous bones (MD, P, and B) displayed mineralization but were shorter at 6 dpf (A, D). BC, the only endochondral bone at this stage, showed deficient mineralization.

### Imaging features of calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease: Consensus definitions from an international multidisciplinary working group [^114fvE7d]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Low credibility.

To develop definitions for imaging features being considered as potential classification criteria for calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease, additional to clinical and laboratory criteria, and to compile example images of CPPD on different imaging modalities.

- **Methods**: The American College of Rheumatology and European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology CPPD classification criteria Imaging Advisory Group (IAG) and Steering Committee drafted definitions of imaging features that are characteristic of CPPD on conventional radiography (CR), conventional computed tomography (CT), dual-energy CT (DECT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An anonymous expert survey was undertaken by a 35-member Combined Expert Committee, including all IAG members. The IAG and 5 external musculoskeletal radiologists with expertise in CPPD convened virtually to further refine item definitions and voted on example images illustrating CR, CT, and DECT item definitions, with ≥ 90% agreement required to deem them acceptable.

- **Results**: The Combined Expert Committee survey indicated consensus on all CR definitions. The IAG and external radiologists reached consensus on CT and DECT item definitions, which specify that calcium pyrophosphate deposits appear less dense than cortical bone. The group developed an MRI definition and acknowledged limitations of this modality for CPPD. Ten example images for CPPD were voted acceptable (4 CR, 4 CT, and 2 DECT), and 3 images of basic calcium phosphate deposition were voted acceptable to serve as contrast against imaging features of CPPD.

### Mutations in fam20b and xylt1 reveal that cartilage matrix controls timing of endochondral ossification by inhibiting chondrocyte maturation [^114f5UPo]. PLOS Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

Early chondrocyte maturation promotes precocious perichondral bone in PG mutants. Our expression data (Figure 4C, 4F), biochemical data (Figure 5F, Figure S3), and rescue experiments (Figure 3C, 3D) suggest that the premature perichondral bone in fam20b and xylt1 mutants is caused by chondrocyte defects. Indian hedgehog (Ihh) is an osteo-inductive signal expressed by chondrocytes as they mature and is required for perichondral bone formation. Therefore, we hypothesized that Ihh and other markers of chondrocyte maturation would appear earlier in fam20b and xylt1 mutants.

The transcription factor Runx2 positively regulates chondrocyte maturation through transcriptional activation of such genes as col10a1 and ihh, so our hypothesis predicted premature up-regulation of runx2 genes and their downstream targets. In support, transcript levels for runx2b were up-regulated in mutant chondrocytes at 3 dpf compared to wild-type chondrocytes (Figure 10A–10C), and col10a1, ihha, and ihhb expression was up-regulated in mutant chondrocytes earlier than in chondrocytes of wild-type siblings (Figure 10D–10L). Expression of sox9a and col2a1a was high in both xylt1 mutant and wild-type chondrocytes at 3 dpf (data not shown).

On the other hand, both transcripts were down-regulated in mature chondrocytes by 6 dpf (data not shown), suggesting that some markers of chondrocyte gene expression were not affected in PG mutants. Importantly, the initiation of chondrocyte differentiation was not accelerated overall in mutants, as Alcian blue staining of pharyngeal cartilages was absent at 48 hpf.
