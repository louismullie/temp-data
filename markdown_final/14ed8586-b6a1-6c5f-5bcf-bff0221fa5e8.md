## Question

What are the potential side effects of alpha blockers in patients with BPH?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the potential side effects of alpha blockers in patients with BPH. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic mechanism that explains both benefit and adverse effects. Then, I should categorize side effects by organ system and frequency, distinguishing class effects from agent-specific differences. Next, I will quantify risks where possible and flag high-risk populations and time windows. After that, I should integrate guideline-based counseling and monitoring recommendations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, patient-centered risk–benefit framework and highlight what would change my conclusions if new evidence emerges.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic foundation, because side effects map directly to receptor subtype selectivity and tissue distribution. Alpha-1 blockers antagonize alpha-1 adrenoceptors, relaxing smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck to improve flow, but they also block vascular alpha-1 receptors, which lowers systemic vascular resistance and can cause orthostatic hypotension, and they interfere with sympathetic tone involved in ejaculation, explaining ejaculatory dysfunction, with the magnitude of these effects varying by subtype selectivity and dose [^1054f296] [^b1d54f40].

> I will now examine cardiovascular effects, since these are the most clinically consequential in older adults. Orthostatic hypotension and dizziness are class effects, with a pronounced first-dose phenomenon and heightened risk during initiation and dose escalation; tamsulosin has a labeled hypotension warning even though it is more uroselective, and large pharmacoepidemiology shows a 1.5–2.5-fold increase in severe hypotension requiring hospitalization in the first 8 weeks of new use or restart, with a smaller but persistent risk during maintenance therapy, which aligns with the known first-dose phenomenon seen with nonselective agents like terazosin and doxazosin [^1063d0ab] [^995aa5cf] [^32ba62e8] [^1054f296].

> Wait, let me verify the comparative cardiovascular safety across agents, because this drives selection in patients with hypertension or polypharmacy. Nonselective quinazoline alpha-1 blockers such as terazosin and doxazosin have higher rates of orthostatic hypotension and syncope and require dose titration, whereas tamsulosin and alfuzosin have lower blood pressure effects, and silodosin has minimal impact on blood pressure but a higher rate of ejaculatory adverse effects; guidelines advise choosing agents with minimal hemodynamic effects in patients on multiple antihypertensives or with orthostatic symptoms [^1054f296] [^56700aa1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about heart failure risk. I initially thought the signal was uniformly increased with alpha blockers, but I should double-check the mixed evidence. Observational population data associate alpha blocker use with increased heart failure diagnoses, with higher risk for nonselective agents, yet a large cohort comparing alpha blockers to 5-ARIs did not find increased heart failure hospitalizations, and a heart failure cohort showed no increased mortality or rehospitalization overall, though risk rose when beta-blockers were absent; reconciling this, the balance suggests a modest signal for incident heart failure in some datasets, with uncertainty and likely confounding, so I should counsel cautiously in patients with established heart failure and ensure beta-blocker co-therapy when alpha blockers are necessary [^70b95bf1] [^53b82520] [^9737850f].

> Next, I should review sexual adverse effects, because these commonly drive discontinuation in younger men. Ejaculatory dysfunction, including retrograde ejaculation and anejaculation, is more frequent with alpha-1A–selective agents such as tamsulosin and especially silodosin, with meta-analytic estimates around 7–8% versus 1% with placebo and higher in some silodosin trials, and the risk is dose-related and more bothersome in sexually active men; importantly, incidence declines with age, which can inform agent selection and counseling [^b1d54f40] [^c587b56a] [^bcf5c19d].

> I need to check ocular risks, because they are often overlooked yet clinically actionable. Alpha blockers can cause intraoperative floppy iris syndrome during cataract surgery, with tamsulosin carrying the strongest signal; guidelines recommend discussing this risk preoperatively and coordinating with ophthalmology, and although stopping the drug preoperatively is reasonable, evidence is limited on whether timing mitigates risk, so shared decision-making is essential [^63290bd4] [^e11d57c57].

> Let me consider central nervous system and miscellaneous effects, which are usually mild but can impair function. Dizziness, asthenia, fatigue, and headache are common class effects, rhinitis is more frequent with tamsulosin, and some patients report insomnia or nervousness; these effects are typically dose-related and often attenuate with continued use, but they can contribute to falls in older adults, reinforcing the need for cautious dosing and fall-risk mitigation [^24e6eced] [^1054f296].

> I should confirm the magnitude of fall and fracture risk, because this affects real-world safety. Population-based studies show an increased risk of hip fracture and falls around the time of alpha blocker initiation, consistent with hypotension-related events; this is particularly salient in men aged 65 and older, and while uroselective agents reduce hypotension, the fracture signal persists, so I need to screen for fall risk, counsel on orthostatic precautions, and consider slower titration or alternative agents in high-risk patients [^7fab1889] [^995aa5cf].

> But wait, what if the patient is on combination therapy or has storage symptoms. Adding antimuscarinics to alpha blockers can improve storage symptoms but increases dry mouth, constipation, and the risk of acute urinary retention, albeit with low absolute risk; mirabegron with an alpha blocker appears to have a safety profile comparable to antimuscarinics in men with mixed LUTS, though data are limited and PVR should be monitored in those at retention risk [^c8eefc45] [^17e7d696] [^aad57768].

> Next, I should review guideline-based counseling and monitoring to translate this into practice. The AUA advises selecting alpha blockers based on adverse event profiles, explicitly warning about ejaculatory dysfunction and blood pressure effects, and recommends informing patients with planned cataract surgery about IFIS risk; follow-up should occur 4–12 weeks after initiation to reassess IPSS, quality of life, and adverse effects, with earlier contact if symptomatic hypotension or sexual effects occur [^f008cc52] [^e11d57c57] [^3e895080].

> I will now examine special populations and drug–drug interactions, because these modify risk. In older adults, especially those with frailty, the risks of hypotension, falls, and cognitive or mood effects may outweigh benefits, so I should individualize therapy and consider deprescribing when feasible; coadministration with PDE5 inhibitors can potentiate hypotension, particularly with nonselective alpha blockers, whereas tamsulosin 0.4 mg appears less likely to interact, though counseling on dizziness remains prudent [^975d3904] [^6005b5b1].

> Let me synthesize a practical risk–benefit framework, and I should double-check that it aligns with evidence. For most men with bothersome moderate-to-severe LUTS, alpha blockers provide a 5–8 point IPSS improvement over 4–12 weeks with relatively rapid onset, but I must balance cardiovascular and sexual adverse effects; in men with hypertension, orthostasis, or high fall risk, tamsulosin or alfuzosin are preferred over terazosin or doxazosin, whereas in sexually active men concerned about ejaculatory effects, agents with lower alpha-1A selectivity may be preferable, acknowledging that no alpha blocker is entirely free of sexual effects [^58f1071f] [^1054f296] [^b1d54f40].

> Finally, I should confirm what would change my conclusions if new data emerge. Head-to-head randomized trials powered for hard outcomes like fractures, major adverse cardiovascular events, and quality-adjusted outcomes are still needed, as most comparative safety data are observational and confounded; additionally, clearer guidance on preoperative alpha blocker management for cataract surgery and on the net clinical benefit of combination strategies in frail older adults would refine selection and counseling, so I will continue to monitor evolving evidence and update recommendations accordingly [^notfound].

Alpha-blockers for BPH commonly cause **orthostatic hypotension** [^1054f296], dizziness, and fatigue, with a notable first-dose effect [^1063d0ab]; tamsulosin and silodosin have less blood pressure impact than terazosin or doxazosin [^1054f296]. Ejaculatory dysfunction (retrograde ejaculation, anejaculation) is frequent with tamsulosin and silodosin [^b1d54f40] [^c587b56a], especially in younger men [^bcf5c19d], and can lead to discontinuation [^b1d54f40]. Other effects include headache, nasal congestion, and rare syncope [^24e6eced]; **cataract surgery risk** (IFIS) [^63290bd4] is a key ophthalmic concern [^e11d57c57]. Serious adverse events (e.g. falls, fractures, cardiovascular events) are uncommon but more likely in older adults or those on multiple antihypertensives [^7fab1889] [^975d3904]. Overall, side effects are usually mild and reversible, but agent selection should be individualized to minimize risks [^f008cc52].

---

## Common side effects

- **Orthostatic hypotension**: Dizziness, lightheadedness, and syncope, particularly with non-selective agents (terazosin, doxazosin) [^1054f296] and during initiation or dose escalation [^1063d0ab].

- **Fatigue and asthenia**: Generalized weakness and tiredness are common, especially early in therapy [^24e6eced].

- **Headache**: Mild to moderate headaches are frequently reported [^24e6eced].

- **Nasal congestion**: Rhinitis-like symptoms, particularly with tamsulosin [^24e6eced].

---

## Sexual side effects

- **Ejaculatory dysfunction**: Retrograde ejaculation, anejaculation, and decreased ejaculate volume are common with tamsulosin and silodosin [^b1d54f40], with silodosin having the highest incidence (approximately 22–28%) [^c587b56a] [^da15d31a].

- **Erectile dysfunction**: Less common than ejaculatory issues, but reported with some agents [^notfound].

- **Decreased libido**: Occasionally reported, though less frequent than ejaculatory dysfunction [^notfound].

---

## Cardiovascular side effects

- **First-dose phenomenon**: Marked hypotension and syncope can occur shortly after the first dose or when restarting therapy, particularly with non-selective agents [^1063d0ab] [^b961a2d2].

- **Palpitations and tachycardia**: Reflex tachycardia may occur due to vasodilation and hypotension [^8178b131].

- **Heart failure**: Observational data suggest a possible increased risk of heart failure with alpha-blockers, particularly non-selective agents, though evidence is mixed and confounded [^70b95bf1] [^7ba3d149].

---

## Ophthalmic side effects

Intraoperative floppy iris syndrome (**IFIS**) is a well-documented risk during cataract surgery, particularly with tamsulosin [^63290bd4]; patients should inform their ophthalmologist before surgery [^e11d57c57].

---

## Rare but serious adverse events

- **Falls and fractures**: Increased risk, particularly in older adults initiating therapy, likely related to orthostatic hypotension [^7fab1889] [^995aa5cf].

- **Depression and cognitive effects**: Some observational studies suggest increased risks of depression, dementia, and suicidal ideation with long-term use, though causality remains uncertain [^975d3904].

- **Allergic reactions**: Rare hypersensitivity reactions, including rash and angioedema, have been reported.

---

## Patient-specific considerations

- **Age**: Older adults are more susceptible to orthostatic hypotension, falls, and cognitive effects [^975d3904].

- **Comorbidities**: Patients with cardiovascular disease, renal impairment, or hepatic dysfunction may require dose adjustments and closer monitoring [^da15d31a].

- **Concurrent medications**: Caution is advised when combining with other antihypertensives, PDE5 inhibitors, or CYP3A4 inhibitors due to potential interactions [^6005b5b1] [^899054b6].

---

## Management strategies

- **Start low, go slow**: Begin at the lowest effective dose and titrate gradually to minimize hypotension and dizziness [^7fab1889].

- **Patient education**: Counsel on orthostatic precautions, potential sexual side effects, and the importance of adherence [^e11d57c57].

- **Regular follow-up**: Monitor blood pressure, symptom control, and adverse effects, adjusting therapy as needed [^3e895080].

- **Alternative therapies**: Consider 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, beta-3 agonists, or minimally invasive procedures for patients with significant side effects or inadequate response [^d89138b6] [^ff5e8c62] [^d89138b6].

---

Alpha-blockers are effective for BPH but have a characteristic side-effect profile; **individualized selection and monitoring** optimize outcomes and tolerability [^f008cc52].

### Does benign prostatic hyperplasia treatment with α-blockers affect prostate cancer risk? [^ee255f0a]. Current Opinion in Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To determine whether alpha-blockers, commonly used for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, are associated with prostate cancer risk.

Recent Findings

Alpha-blockers have been associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer aggressiveness in some observational studies and an increased risk in other studies. However, this relationship is complex as different alpha-blockers have divergent effects in laboratory studies and there are many confounders in daily practice such as differential screening practices.

Summary

Both benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer are common conditions in the aging male population, such that an interaction between alpha-blockers and prostate cancer risk is clinically relevant. Prospective evidence is necessary to establish a definitive link.

Selective alpha1-adrenergic blockade is now a well accepted and widely used therapeutic treatment for patients presenting with symptomatic bladder outlet obstruction thought to be associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia. This review summarizes the recent developments in this field relating to the subject of receptor subtype selectivity and the potential relevance of this to clinical usefulness of existing drug therapy. Whilst a number of unanswered questions remain as to the exact mechanisms of both drug action and side-effect profile, nevertheless it is clear that existing clinically available alpha1-antagonists provide a safe, effective and generally well tolerated therapy for patients with lower urinary tract symptoms thought to be associated with benign prostatic obstruction. The implications of the ALLHAT study are discussed.

### Silodosin for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^c587b56a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

A variety of alpha-blockers are used for treating lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Silodosin is a novel, more selective alpha-blocker, which is specific to the lower urinary tract and may have fewer side effects than other alpha-blockers.

Objectives

To assess the effects of silodosin for the treatment of LUTS in men with BPH.

Search Methods

We performed a comprehensive search using multiple databases (Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science), trials registries, other sources of grey literature, and conference proceedings with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status up until 13 June 2017.

Selection Criteria

We included all parallel, randomized controlled trials. We also included cross-over designs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies. We performed statistical analyses using a random-effects model and interpreted them according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We rated the quality of evidence according to the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 19 unique studies with 4295 randomized participants across four comparisons for short-term follow-up. The mean age, prostate volume, and International Prostate Symptom Score were 66.5 years, 38.2 mL, and 19.1, respectively. Silodosin versus placeboBased on four studies with a total of 1968 randomized participants, silodosin may reduce urologic symptom scores in an appreciable number of men (mean difference (MD) -2.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.23 to -2.08; low-quality evidence). Silodosin likely does not result in a clinically important reduction in quality of life (MD -0.42, 95% CI -0.71 to -0.13; moderate-quality evidence). It may not increase rates of treatment withdrawal for any reason (relative risk (RR) 1.08, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.66; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of silodosin on cardiovascular adverse events (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.45; very low-quality evidence). Silodosin likely increases sexual adverse events (RR 26.07, 95% CI 12.36 to 54.97; moderate-quality evidence); this would result in 180 more sexual adverse events per 1000 men (95% CI 82 more to 388 more). Silodosin versus tamsulosinBased on 13 studies with a total of 2129 randomized participants, silodosin may result in little to no difference in urologic symptom scores (MD -0.04, 95% CI -1.31 to 1.24; low-quality evidence) and quality of life (MD -0.15, 95% CI -0.53 to 0.22; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain about treatment withdrawals for any reason (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.69; very low-quality evidence). Silodosin may result in little to no difference in cardiovascular adverse events (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.12; low-quality evidence). Silodosin likely increases sexual adverse events (RR 6.05, 95% CI 3.55 to 10.31; moderate-quality evidence); this would result in 141 more sexual adverse events per 1000 men (95% CI 71 more to 261 more). Silodosin versus naftopidilBased on five studies with a total of 763 randomized participants, silodosin may result in little to no differences in urologic symptom scores (MD -0.85, 95% CI -2.57 to 0.87; low-quality evidence), quality of life (MD -0.17, 95% CI -0.60 to 0.27; low-quality evidence), treatment withdrawal for any reason (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.93; low-quality evidence), and cardiovascular adverse events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.56; low-quality evidence). Silodosin likely increases sexual adverse events (RR 5.93, 95% CI 2.16 to 16.29; moderate-quality evidence); this would result in 74 more sexual adverse events per 1000 men (95% CI 17 more to 231 more). Silodosin versus alfuzosinBased on two studies with a total of 155 randomized participants, silodosin may or may not result in a clinically important increase in urologic symptom scores (MD 3.83, 95% CI 0.12 to 7.54; low-quality evidence). Silodosin likely results in little to no difference in quality of life (MD 0.14, 95% CI -0.46 to 0.74; moderate-quality evidence). We found no event of treatment withdrawal for any reason. Silodosin may not reduce cardiovascular adverse events (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.24; low-quality evidence) but likely increases sexual adverse events (RR 37.21, 95% CI 5.32 to 260.07; moderate-quality evidence); this would result in 217 more sexual adverse events per 1000 men (95% CI 26 more to 1000 more).

Authors' Conclusions

Silodosin may reduce urologic symptom scores in an appreciable number of men compared to placebo. Quality of life and treatment withdrawals for any reason appears similar. Its efficacy appears similar to that of other alpha blockers (tamsulosin, naftopidil and alfuzosin) but the rate of sexual side effects is likely higher. Our certainty in the estimates of effect was lowered due to study limitations, inconsistency and imprecision.

### What tests are… [^5e88415b]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Which Medical Therapies Are Effective in the Management of BPH. Alpha blockers are effective for bothersome, moderate to severe BPH and are recommended in men not undergoing planned cataract surgery. The combination of alpha blockers and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors is effective for long-term management of BPH and demonstrated large prostates. Anticholinergic agents can benefit selected patients with predominantly irritative lower urinary tract symptoms and a normal postvoid residual urine measurement. EVIDENCE SUMMARY Alpha Blockers. Alpha blockers antagonize alpha 1-receptors in the prostatic urethra and bladder neck, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and improvement of lower urinary tract symptoms, typically within two to four weeks after initiation. 2 The AUA recommends the alpha blockers alfuzosin, doxazosin, tamsulosin, and terazosin as first-line treatments for men with BPH and bothersome, moderate to severe symptoms.

2 A meta-analysis of 21 studies comparing these four alpha blockers with placebo demonstrated 30% to 45% improvement in symptom scores over one month to one year; the alpha blockers were equally effective. 15 Silodosin is another alpha blocker with demonstrated effectiveness in BPH management. 19 The evidence for phenoxybenzamine and prazosin is insufficient, and these medications are not recommended.
2. Adverse effect profiles vary among selective and non-selective alpha blockers. 2, 3, 15, 19, 20, 23, 24 The AUA recommends avoidance of all alpha blockers in men with planned cataract surgery because of the risk of intraoperative floppy iris syndrome. 2, 20 It is unclear if the dose, duration of therapy, or stopping the alpha blocker lowers this risk. 2 There is an increased risk of urinary retention with a post-void residual urine measurement greater than 250 mL.

2 A meta-analysis of seven randomized controlled trials comparing combination anticholinergic and alpha-blocker therapy with alpha-blocker mono-therapy demonstrated greater reduction of I-PSS scores in the combination group. There was one additional episode of acute urinary retention for every 101 men treated in the combination group. 24.

### WITHDRAWN: terazosin for benign prostatic hyperplasia [^450a4f72]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic obstruction (BPO) occur in up to 70% of men over the age of 60 years. To relieve these bothersome symptoms, treatment options include alpha-antagonists, also know as alpha-blockers.

Objectives

We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness and adverse effects of the alpha-blocker, terazosin, for treatment of urinary symptoms associated with BPO.

Search Strategy

Trials were searched in computerized general and specialized databases (MEDLINE, Cochrane Library), by checking bibliographies, and by contacting manufacturers and researchers.

Selection Criteria

Studies were included if they (1) were randomized trials of at least 1 month duration, and (2) included men with symptomatic BPO and compared terazosin with placebo or active controls.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study, patient characteristics and outcomes data were extracted in duplicate onto standardized forms utilizing a prospectively developed protocol. The main outcome measure for comparing the effectiveness of terazosin with placebo or other BPO medications was change in urological symptoms as measured by validated symptom scores. Secondary outcomes included urodynamic measures. The main outcome measure for adverse effects was the number of men reporting side effects. We also evaluated the number of men withdrawing from treatment and the number withdrawing due to adverse effects.

Main Results

Seventeen studies involving 5151 subjects met inclusion criteria (placebo-controlled (n = 10); alpha-blockers (n = 7); finasteride alone or in combination with terazosin as well as placebo (1); microwave therapy (TUMT) (1). Study duration ranged from 4 to 52 weeks. Mean age was 65 years and 82% of men were white. Baseline urologic symptom scale scores and flow rates demonstrated that men had moderate BPO. Efficacy outcomes were rarely reported in a fashion that allowed for data pooling but indicated that terazosin improved symptom scores and flow rates more than placebo or finasteride and similarly to other alpha antagonists. The pooled mean percentage improvements for the Boyarsky symptom score was 37% for terazosin versus 15% for placebo (n = 4 studies). The mean percentage improvement for the American Urological Association symptom score (AUA) was 38% compared to 17% and 20% for placebo and finasteride, respectively (n = 2 studies). The pooled mean improvement in the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) (40%) was similar to tamsulosin (43%). Peak urine flow rates improved greater with terazosin (22%), than placebo (11%) and finasteride (15%) but did not differ significantly from the other alpha-blockers. The percentage of men discontinuing terazosin was comparable to men receiving placebo and finasteride but was greater then with other alpha-antagonists. Adverse effects were greater than placebo and included dizziness, asthenia, headache, and postural hypotension.

Authors' Conclusions

The available evidence suggests that terazosin improves urinary symptoms and flow measures associated with BPO. Effectiveness is superior to placebo or finasteride, similar to other alpha-blockers but less than TUMT. Adverse effects were generally mild but more frequent than other alpha-blockers and associated with between a two-to-four fold increase in treatment discontinuation.

### Role of the newer alpha,-adrenergic-receptor antagonists in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia-related lower urinary tract symptoms [^0511c3f5]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Although initially introduced for the management of hypertension, alpha(1)-adrenergic-receptor antagonists (alpha1-blockers) have become the standard of care for the medical management of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)-related lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). However, these agents have the potential to produce orthostatic hypotension and other blood pressure-related adverse effects in normotensive patients and in those receiving concurrent treatment with other antihypertensive agents. As a result, more "uroselective", less vasoactive alpha(1)-blockers have been developed.

Objective

This article reviews current information on the role of alpha(1)-blockers in the treatment of BPH-related LUTS. The focus is on tamsulosin and alfuzosin, newer "uroselective" agents in this class that have a decreased potential for cardiovascular adverse effects.

Methods

Relevant articles were identified through a search of the English-language literature indexed on MEDLINE and the proceedings of scientific meetings from 1976 to 2003. The search terms were benign prostatic hyperplasia treatment, alpha(1)-adrenergic-receptor blocker, uroselectivity, lower urinary tract symptoms, complications, and cardiovascular.

Results

Tamsulosin has selectivity for the a alpha(1) and alpha(1d) receptor subtypes. Alfuzosin, although not receptor subtype selective, is clinically "uroselective" and does not significantly affect vascular alpha-adrenergic receptors. Both agents are efficacious in relieving LUTS and have a decreased potential for such cardiovascular adverse effects as postural hypotension. Common adverse events with these agents include dizziness and asthenia.

Conclusion

Based on the available data, "uroselective" alpha(1)-blockers should be considered over older, more vasoactive agents for the medical management of LUTS, particularly in patients with BPH and hypertension.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^bcf5c19d]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Patient-reported anejaculation and age-related trends — Anejaculation is noted by patients and may lead to dissatisfaction and treatment discontinuation. In the phase III silodosin studies, the number of men reporting EjD as an adverse event decreased from 46% to 11% for men in their 50s versus 70s, respectively, and the number of men discontinuing treatment due to the adverse events decreased from 4.7% to 0%. Based on these examples, it is reasonable to select alpha blockers with equal efficacy based on expected adverse events, and younger sexually active men are more likely to discontinue due to EjD; therefore, it would be prudent to select alpha blockers with a low incidence of EjD.

5-alpha reductase inhibitor (5-ARI) therapy — indications and counseling: For the purpose of symptom improvement, 5-ARI monotherapy should be used as a treatment option in patients with LUTS/BPH with prostatic enlargement as judged by a prostate volume of > 30g on imaging, a prostate specific antigen (PSA) > 1.5ng/mL, or palpable prostate enlargement on digital rectal exam (DRE). (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B) 5-ARIs alone or in combination with alpha blockers are recommended as a treatment option to prevent progression of LUTS/BPH and/or reduce the risks of urinary retention and need for future prostate-related surgery. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A) Before starting a 5-ARI, clinicians should inform patients of the risks of sexual side effects, certain uncommon physical side effects, and the low risk of prostate cancer.

### Terazosin for benign prostatic hyperplasia [^3c18960a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic obstruction (BPO) occur in up to 70% of men over the age of 60 years. To relieve these bothersome symptoms, treatment options include alpha-antagonists, also know as alpha-blockers.

Objectives

We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness and adverse effects of the alpha-blocker, terazosin, for treatment of urinary symptoms associated with BPO.

Search Strategy

Trials were searched in computerized general and specialized databases (MEDLINE, Cochrane Library), by checking bibliographies, and by contacting manufacturers and researchers.

Selection Criteria

Studies were included if they (1) were randomized trials of at least 1 month duration, and (2) included men with symptomatic BPO and compared terazosin with placebo or active controls.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study, patient characteristics and outcomes data were extracted in duplicate onto standardized forms utilizing a prospectively developed protocol. The main outcome measure for comparing the effectiveness of terazosin with placebo or other BPO medications was change in urological symptoms as measured by validated symptom scores. Secondary outcomes included urodynamic measures. The main outcome measure for adverse effects was the number of men reporting side effects. We also evaluated the number of men withdrawing from treatment and the number withdrawing due to adverse effects.

Main Results

17 studies involving 5,151 subjects met inclusion criteria (placebo-controlled (10); alpha-blockers (7); finasteride alone or in combination with terazosin as well as placebo (1); microwave therapy (TUMT) (1). Study duration ranged from 4–52 weeks. Mean age was 65 years and 82% of men were white. Baseline urologic symptom scale scores and flow rates demonstrated that men had moderate BPO. Efficacy outcomes were rarely reported in a fashion that allowed for data pooling but indicated that terazosin improved symptom scores and flow rates more than placebo or finasteride and similarly to other alpha antagonists. The pooled mean percentage improvements for the Boyarsky symptom score was 37% for terazosin versus 15% for placebo (n = 4 studies). The mean percentage improvement for the American Urological Association symptom score (AUA) was 38% compared to 17% and 20% for placebo and finasteride, respectively (n = 2 studies). The pooled mean improvement in the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) (40%) was similar to tamsulosin (43%). Peak urine flow rates improved greater with terazosin (22%), than placebo (11%) and finasteride (15%) but did not differ significantly from the other alpha-blockers. The percentage of men discontinuing terazosin was comparable to men receiving placebo and finasteride but was greater then with other alpha-antagonists. Adverse effects were greater than placebo and included dizziness, asthenia, headache and postural hypotension.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The available evidence suggests that terazosin improves urinary symptoms and flow measures associated with BPO. Effectiveness is superior to placebo or finasteride, similar to other alpha-blockers but less than TUMT. Adverse effects were generally mild but more frequent than other alpha-blockers and associated with between a two-four fold increase in treatment discontinuation.

### Role of antimuscarinics combined with alpha-blockers in the management of urinary storage symptoms in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^c8eefc45]. The Journal of Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We evaluate the efficacy and safety of combining antimuscarinics with alpha-blockers to treat storage symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Materials and Methods

Searches were carried out on PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases to identify randomized, placebo-controlled trials published before February 15, 2022, assessing the efficacy or safety of antimuscarinics in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia treated with alpha-blockers. Further meta-analyses were performed using standardized mean difference and risk ratio.

Results

A total of 12 randomized trials were included in the systematic review. The meta-analysis showed no impact of antimuscarinics on the number of urgencies per day (SMD -0.23 [95%CI: -0.64; -0.17]; P = 0.21). However, the use of antimuscarinics was associated with a small reduction of micturition episodes per day (SMD -0.19 [95%CI: -0.37; -0.01]; P = 0.045). With regard to side effects, post-void residual increased slightly in patients treated with antimuscarinics (SMD 0.26 [95%CI: 0.15; 0.37]; P < .01). In addition, there was a higher risk of acute urinary retention (RR 3.26 [95%CI: 1.35; 7.86]; P = 0.02), dry mouth (RR 3.43 [95%CI: 1.86; 6.32]; P < .001), and constipation (RR 2.92 [95%CI: 1.48; 5.73]; P < .001) with the use of antimuscarinics. Finally, the risk of treatment interruption due to adverse events was higher for the patients treated with antimuscarinics (RR 1.74 [95%CI: 1.27; 2.38]; P < .01).

Conclusions

The addition of antimuscarinics to alpha-blockers was not associated with a substantial reduction in urgencies and micturition episodes in benign prostatic hyperplasia patients with storage symptoms. In addition, the toxicity profile was not in favor of antimuscarinic use in these patients.

### Α-blockers for benign prostatic hyperplasia: the new era [^6dacc8a9]. Current Opinion in Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

α1-Adrenoceptor blockers are the most frequently prescribed medical therapy in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptom suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (LUTS/BPH). The purpose of this review is to highlight the evolution of adrenoceptor blockers with emphasis on newly approved drugs.

Recent Findings

Over the past years new formulations of several α1-adrenoceptor blockers were introduced to the market. Five long-acting α1-blockers are currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of symptomatic LUTS/BPH: terazosin, doxazosin, tamsulosin, alfuzosin and silodosin. Silodosin is the only adrenoceptor blocker that exhibits true selectivity for the α1-adrenoceptor subtypes. This unique adrenoceptor selectivity profile likely accounts for the very favorable cardiovascular safety profile.

Summary

Tamsulosin, alfuzosin slow release and silodosin do not require dose titration. Alfuzosin, terazosin, doxazosin and silodosin have all been shown to be effective in relieving LUTS/BPH independent of prostate size. Low incidence of orthostatic hypotension has been reported for silodosin, but abnormal ejaculation is the most commonly reported adverse effect.

### Impact of alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist use for benign prostatic hypertrophy on outcomes in patients with heart failure [^9737850f]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Previous clinical trials have shown that alpha(1)-adrenergic antagonists are not effective in subjects with heart failure (HF) and might increase HF rates when used for hypertension. However, alpha(1)-adrenergic antagonists may be prescribed to subjects with HF who have symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia. We sought to determine any association between alpha(1)-adrenergic antagonist use, commonly prescribed for benign prostatic hyperplasia, and the clinical outcomes of subjects with HF receiving contemporary therapy. An existing database of 388 subjects with decompensated HF admissions from 2002 to 2004 at the Veterans Affairs Hospital was analyzed according to the use of alpha(1)-adrenergic antagonists at discharge. Covariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine any association with future admissions for decompensated HF and total mortality. Alpha-1-adrenergic antagonist therapy was prescribed in 25% of our HF population, predominantly for benign prostatic hyperplasia, and was not associated with significant increases in the combined risk of all-cause mortality and rehospitalization for HF (hazard ratio 1.24, 95% confidence interval 0.93 to 1.65, p = 0.14), HF hospitalization (hazard ratio 1.20, 95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.70, p = 0.31), or all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 1.10, 95% confidence interval 0.78 to 1.56, p = 0.57). In patients not receiving beta-blocker therapy, alpha(1)-adrenergic antagonist therapy was significantly associated with increased HF hospitalizations (hazard ratio 1.94, 95% confidence interval 1.14 to 3.32, p = 0.015). In conclusion, in patients with chronic HF, the use of alpha(1)-adrenergic antagonists was significantly associated with more HF hospitalizations when prescribed without concomitant beta blockade. Thus, background beta-blocker therapy appears to be protective against the potential harmful effects of alpha(1)-adrenergic antagonist therapy in patients with HF.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^1054f296]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) alpha-1 blockers — Given the similar efficacy of the approved alpha-1-adrenergic antagonists, the choice of specific agent should consider the differing adverse events profiles of each. The quinazolin derivatives, terazosin and doxazosin, are non-specific alpha-1 receptor blockers that are both approved for the treatment of hypertension, as well as BPH, while tamsulosin, alfuzosin, and silodosin have lower potential to cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope than either terazosin or doxazosin; tamsulosin may further have slightly less effect on blood pressure than alfuzosin, and the only two alpha blockers with selectivity for the alpha 1a versus the alpha 1b receptor are tamsulosin (10:1) and silodosin (161:1).

Conclusions

This cohort study is the largest study of the association of ABs with cardiovascular events to date, to our knowledge. We found that new prescription of ABs compared with 5-ARIs was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality and MACE among patients with BPH. Although we present the most extensive analysis, to our knowledge, of the cardiovascular safety of ABs heretofore, further investigation with more detailed clinical data is warranted to guide ongoing clinical practice.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^d89138b6]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) treatment — goals, medications, and procedural indications/classification are outlined as follows: Traditionally, the primary goal of treatment has been to alleviate bothersome LUTS that result from BPO, and more recently treatment has also focused on the prevention of disease progression and complications such as AUR; pharmacologic classes used to treat LUTS/BPH include alpha-adrenergic antagonists (alpha blockers), 5-ARIs, PDE5, and anticholinergics, which may be utilized alone or in combination to take advantage of their different mechanisms of action, and an additional class of agent that may be considered in combination with alpha blockers is beta-3 agonists; there exist clinical scenarios in which conservative or pharmacological management are either inadequate or inappropriate and long-term use of medications for LUTS/BPH have been implicated in cognitive issues and depression, and these situations merit consideration of one of the many invasive procedures available for the treatment of LUTS/BPH; indications include a desire by the patient to avoid taking a daily medication, failure of medical therapy to sufficiently ameliorate bothersome LUTS, intolerance to pharmaceutical side effects, and conditions for which medical therapy is insufficient such as acute and/or chronic renal insufficiency, refractory urinary retention, recurrent UTIs, recurrent bladder stones, and recalcitrant gross hematuria; acute and chronic adverse events associated with each class of medical therapy can include cardiovascular and sexual effects; surgical treatment of symptomatic BPH may be classified into three general types: 1. MIST; 2. Simple prostatectomy; and 3. Transurethral surgery, with transurethral surgery involving removal of the obstructing adenomatous tissue via the transurethral route, classically with monopolar electrocautery TURP, and alternatives developed including bipolar TURP and various laser-based therapies to achieve similar clinical efficacy while reducing the risks of perioperative bleeding and short- and long-term complications; in appropriate patients for whom the physical size of the prostate cannot be addressed due to the expertise of the surgeon via a safe or efficacious transurethral approach, simple prostatectomy (i.e., adenoma enucleation) may be considered.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) — anticholinergic plus alpha blocker combinations show mixed symptom benefits and variable adverse events: Trials of tolterodine 4 mg with an alpha blocker versus alpha blocker alone improved the proportion with > 3-point IPSS decrease, but mean IPSS change was -5.9 versus -5.6 and withdrawals due to adverse events were slightly higher. In a 12-week add-on study of fesoterodine 4 or 8 mg plus alpha blocker versus placebo plus alpha blocker in patients with moderate LUTS (baseline IPSS 19; PVR < 200 mL), IPSS change was -4.4 for both groups with higher adverse-event–related withdrawals for fesoterodine. An older 12-week double-blind RCT of oxybutynin 10 mg + tamsulosin 0.4 mg versus tamsulosin + placebo reported baseline IPSS 20; response defined as ≥ 3 point reduction was 75% versus 65%, mean IPSS change -6.9 versus -5.2, and no difference in adverse events or withdrawals. Since there are increased adverse events, one can consider initially starting with alpha blocker alone and adding anticholinergics in selected cases.

Rates of depression in men on 5-ARI compared to a non-exposure group demonstrated slightly higher rates that were sustained after 3 years. In contrast, analyses using a cohort and case control design comparing finasteride or dutasteride, alone or with an alpha blocker, to a placebo group largely demonstrated similar rates of treated depression independent of drug regimen. Other psychological effects, such as increased suicidality and psychological adverse events, have also been examined.

### A review of combination therapy in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^64b3d0e6]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Trials of monotherapy with alpha(1)-adrenergic-receptor antagonists (alpha(1)ARAs) and 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) have found that the former drug class is effective in managing benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)-related lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and improving the maximal urinary flow rate in shortand long-term treatment, regardless of prostate size, whereas the latter drug class is effective in reducing prostate size and preventing disease progression in longer-term treatment. The differing mechanisms of action and areas of efficacy of these 2 drug classes make them promising candidates for combination therapy.

Objective

This article reviews key trials of monotherapy and combination alpha(1)ARV5ARI therapy in the treatment and prevention of BPH-related voiding dysfunction.

Methods

MEDLINE (1976–2006) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1976–2006) were searched for relevant clinical trials and reviews using the terms benign prostatic byperplasia, lower urinary tract symptoms, LUTS, alpha-adrenergic-receptor antagonists, alpha-blockers, 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors, combination therapy, MTOPS, SMART, PREDICT, adverse events, alfuzosin, doxazosin, tamsulosin, terazosin, dutasteride, and finasteride. Abstracts from selected professional conferences also were reviewed.

Results

Three previous trials of alpha(1)ARA/5ARI therapy found no therapeutic benefit for combination therapy relative to monotherapy, but their conclusions were limited to some extent by their designs, particularly the duration of treatment. Data from the Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) study, however, indicated a potential role for long-term use of alpha(1)ARA/5ARI therapy, particularly in patients with greater symptom severity (mean score of 17 on the American Urological Association symptom index), larger prostate volume (mean, 32 g), and higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels (> 1.5 ng/mL) at baseline. In the MTOPS study, combination therapy with the alpha(1)ARA doxazosin and the SARI finasteride was significantly more effective than either component alone in reducing BPH-related symptoms (P = 0.006 vs doxazosin monotherapy; P < 0.001 vs finasteride monotherapy) and lowering the rate of overall clinical progression (P < 0.001 vs either monotherapy). In addition, there are data from a subgroup analysis of MTOPS suggesting that the presence of prostatic inflammation may indicate a greater likelihood of treatment efficacy with combination alpha(1)ARA/5ARI therapy.

Conclusions

The available data suggest that combination alpha(1)ARA/5ARI therapy is beneficial in the treatment of BPH and the associated symptoms. The greatest efficacy was evident in patients with an enlarged prostate, more severe symptoms, and higher PSA levels. There are limited data suggesting that the presence of prostatic inflammation may indicate a greater likelihood of treatment efficacy with combination therapy.

### Phosphodiesterase inhibitors for lower urinary tract symptoms consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^31bb6392]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) refers to non-malignant enlargement of the prostate gland that may cause bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Alpha-blockers (ABs) and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) are the mainstay of medical treatment. Recently, phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDEIs) that so far have been used mainly to treat erectile dysfunction were introduced to treat male LUTS.

Objectives

To assess the effects of PDEIs compared to placebo and other standard of care drugs (ABs and 5-ARIs) in men with LUTS consistent with BPH.

Search Methods

We conducted a systematic search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and clinical trials registries of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (updated 2 August 2018). We performed citation tracking and handsearching of abstracts and conference proceedings. We also contacted study authors to ask for additional information.

Selection Criteria

We considered for inclusion in this systematic review randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PDEIs versus placebo, ABs, or 5-ARIs for at least four weeks in men with BPH-LUTS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently screened the literature and extracted data. Primary outcomes were effects on urinary symptoms as assessed by the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS-total; score ranging from 0 to 35, with higher values reflecting more symptoms), urinary bother as assessed by the Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Impact Index (BPHII; score ranging from 0 to 13, with higher values reflecting more bother), and adverse events (AEs). We used GRADE to rate the quality of evidence. We considered short-term (up to 12 weeks) and long-term (12 weeks or longer) results separately.

Main Results

We included a total of 16 randomised trials in this review. The results for primary outcomes are as follows.PDEI versus placebo: PDEIs may result in a small improvement in IPSS-total score (mean difference (MD) 1.89 lower, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.27 lower to 1.50 lower; n = 4293; low-quality evidence) compared to placebo, and may reduce the BPHII score slightly (MD 0.52 lower, 95% CI 0.71 lower to 0.33 lower; n = 3646; low-quality evidence). Rates of AEs may be increased (risk ratio (RR) 1.42, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.67; n = 4386; low-quality evidence). This corresponds to 95 more AEs per 1000 participants (95% CI 47 more to 151 more per 1000). Study results were limited to a treatment duration of six to 12 weeks.PDEI versus AB: PDEIs and ABs probably provide similar improvement in IPSS-total score (MD 0.22 higher, 95% CI 0.49 lower to 0.93 higher; n = 933; moderate-quality evidence) and may have a similar effect on BPHII score (MD 0.03 higher, 95% CI 1.10 lower to 1.16 higher; n = 550; low-quality evidence) and AEs (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.30; n = 936; low-quality evidence). This corresponds to 71 more AEs per 1000 participants (95% CI 41 fewer to 264 more per 1000). Study results were limited to a treatment duration of six to 12 weeks.PDEI and AB versus AB alone: the combination of PDEI and AB may provide a small improvement in IPSS-total score (MD 2.56 lower, 95% CI 3.92 lower to 1.19 lower; n = 193; low-quality evidence) compared to AB alone. We found no evidence for BPHII scores. AEs may be increased (RR 2.81, 95% CI 1.53 to 5.17; n = 194; moderate-quality evidence). This corresponds to 235 more AEs per 1000 participants (95% CI 69 more to 542 more per 1000). Study results were limited to treatment duration of four to 12 weeks.PDEI and AB versus PDEI alone: the combination of PDEI and AB may provide a small improvement in IPSS-total (MD 2.4 lower, 95% CI 6.47 lower to 1.67 higher; n = 40; low-quality evidence) compared to PDEI alone. We found no data on BPHII or AEs. Study results were limited to a treatment duration of four weeks.PDEI and 5-ARI versus 5-ARI alone: in the short term (up to 12 weeks), the combination of PDEI and 5-ARI probably results in a small improvement in IPSS-total score (MD 1.40 lower, 95% CI 2.24 lower to 0.56 lower; n = 695; moderate-quality evidence) compared to 5-ARI alone. We found no evidence on BPHII scores or AEs. In the long term (13 to 26 weeks), the combination of PDEI and 5-ARI likely results in a small reduction in IPSS-total score (MD 1.00 less, 95% CI 1.83 lower to 0.17 lower; n = 695; moderate-quality evidence). We found no evidence about effects on BPHII scores. There may be no difference in rates of AEs (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.36; n = 695; low-quality evidence). This corresponds to 19 more AEs per 1000 participants (95% CI 43 fewer to 98 more per 1000). We found no trials comparing other combinations of treatments or comparing different PDEI agents.

Compared to placebo, PDEI likely leads to a small reduction in IPSS-total and BPHII sores, with a possible increase in AEs. There may be no differences between PDEI and AB with regards to improvement in IPSS-total, BPHII, and incidence of AEs. There appears to be no added benefit of PDEI combined with AB compared to PDEI or AB alone or PDEI combined with 5-ARI compared to ARI alone with regards to urinary symptoms. Most evidence was limited to short-term treatment up to 12 weeks and of moderate or low certainty.

### Silodosin for benign prostatic hyperplasia [^da15d31a]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical trials, and safety of silodosin, a recently approved alpha(1A)-adrenergic receptor (AR) antagonist for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

Data Sources

English-only articles obtained from MEDLINE (1966-October 2009) using the search terms silodosin and KMD-3213 were reviewed. In addition, a search of International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-October 2009) was conducted.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Available English-language articles were reviewed, as well as abstracts from available non-English articles.

Data Synthesis

Silodosin reduces urinary symptoms associated with BPH in as little as 1 day after initiation. The largest clinical trial conducted to date demonstrated a decrease in International Prostate Symptom Score of -6.4 ± 6.63 points compared to -3.5 ± 5.84 in patients receiving placebo (p < 0.0001). Silodosin also improved urinary flow rates by approximately 2.8 ± 3.44 mL/sec, which is comparable to other alpha(1)-AR antagonists. The usual dose of silodosin is 8 mg once daily and should be reduced to 4 mg for patients with moderate renal dysfunction. Use is contraindicated in patients with severe renal and hepatic impairment or taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. In clinical trials, the most prevalent adverse effects were ejaculatory disturbances, occurring in approximately 28% of patients, although only 2.8% of patients discontinued treatment due to this adverse effect. Preliminary data suggest that, similar to other third-generation alpha(1A)-AR antagonists, silodosin has little potential to cause significant cardiovascular adverse effects such as orthostatic hypotension or syncope. To confirm these findings, long-term studies are still needed, especially in patients taking antihypertensive agents and in those with a history of intolerance to other alpha(1)-AR antagonists.

Conclusions

Silodosin was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2008. Long-term studies demonstrating improvement in clinically important outcomes of BPH have yet to be published. In addition, pharmacoeconomic analyses would assist in defining its current place in therapy. Until this information is available, silodosin may be best reserved as an alternative to other second- and third-generation alpha(1)-AR antagonists.

### New innovative therapies for benign prostatic hyperplasia: any advance? [^4d2d4d35]. Current Opinion in Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Benign prostatic hyperplasia is the most common human neoplasm and it is the most frequent tumour requiring surgical treatment in men. Not surprisingly, interest centres on either understanding of prostatic growth during ageing or on various medical or interventional treatments.

Recent Findings

Recent publications describe the interaction of various 5alpha-reductase inhibitors on the two 5alpha-reductase isoforms type 1 and 2, giving a potential new insight into the pathogenesis of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Likewise, chronic inflammation increases growth patterns of fibromuscular tissue in benign prostatic hyperplasia similar to wound healing, and a paracrine loop for chronic inflammation with overexpression of interleukin could be identified. This could be of particular importance in the further understanding of prostatic enlargement. Herbal drug treatment for lower urinary tract symptoms seems to be more effective than previously thought. According to recent publications the effectiveness is well beyond placebo effects. Likewise, alpha-blockers play an important role in treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms with alpha-1 adrenoreceptor antagonists preventing cell proliferation and apoptotic imbalances in prostatic tissue. The effect of alpha-blockers, however, may be limited by severe bladder outlet obstruction with patients at increased risk of treatment failure. Laser prostatectomy and microwave thermotherapy are under consideration as alternative treatments of benign prostatic hyperplasia. The efficacy of urodynamically proven de-obstruction as compared with transurethral resection of the prostate needs to be evaluated. Newer alternative treatments like ethanol installation or bipolar plasma kinetic vaporization have been described, but long-term results and larger patients cohort are still lacking.

Summary

New insights into prostatic growth and pathogenesis of benign prostatic hyperplasia are presented. Medical treatment and interventional therapies are evaluated for their safety and efficacy. Only a few new therapeutical options, however, have been published during this review period.

### Tamsulosin treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia and risk of severe hypotension in men aged 40–85 years in the United States: risk window analyses using between and within patient methodology [^1063d0ab]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

We observed an increased rate ratio for severe hypotension requiring admission to hospital with tamsulosin treatment. The greatest increase in risk — varying in magnitude from 151% to 256% — was observed during the first eight weeks of new drug use and the first eight weeks after restarting drug treatment. A smaller increase in risk for hypotension, varying from 19% to 36%, persisted during maintenance tamsulosin treatment.

Antagonism of α1 adrenoreceptors by tamsulosin relaxes the smooth muscles in the bladder neck and prostate to improve urine flow rate and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Although hypertension is not an approved indication for tamsulosin, α blockers are also known to decrease systemic vascular resistance and reduce blood pressure. Clinical trials observed a 12% incidence for orthostatic hypotension among patients taking 0.4 mg tamsulosin, and a 6% incidence among patients taking placebo between four to eight hours after dosing; however, no treatment emergent hypotensive events were observed. In these trials, patients were retained at the treating site for eight hours after the first dose and received counseling on the effects of orthostatic hypotension. This environment may not apply to treatment practice in the real world. Three currently approved selective α1 adrenergicantagonists (doxazosin, prazosin, terazosin) have black boxed warnings for severe hypotension and syncope, particularly at the first dose. Tamsulosin has a warning for hypotension, but without a black box or information on a potential first dose phenomenon. Our data add to the current literature to better define and quantify the first dose phenomenon of tamsulosin on risk for hypotension.

### Comparative effectiveness of newer medications for lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^3feaa8eb]. European Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Alpha-blockers (ABs) and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors have an established role in treating male lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Recently, newer drugs have shown promise for this indication.

Objective

To assess the comparative effectiveness and adverse effects (AEs) of newer drugs to treat LUTS attributed to BPH through a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Evidence Acquisition

Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Ovid Embase bibliographic databases (through June 2016) were hand searches for references of relevant studies. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials published in English of newer ABs, antimuscarinics, a beta-3 adrenoceptor agonist, phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors, or combination therapy with one of these medications as an active comparator. Observational studies of the same agents with a duration ≥ 1 yr that reported AEs were also included.

Evidence Synthesis

We synthesized evidence from 43 randomized controlled trials as well as five observational studies. Based on improvement of mean International Prostate Symptom Score and quality of life scores, the effectiveness of the newer ABs was not different from the older ABs (moderate strength of evidence [SOE]), but had more AEs (low SOE). Antimuscarinics/AB combination therapy had similar outcomes as AB monotherapy (all moderate SOE), but often had more AEs. Phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors alone or in combination with ABs had similar or inferior outcomes than ABs alone. Evidence was insufficient for the beta-3 adrenoceptor agonist. For all newer agents, the evidence was generally insufficient to assess long-term efficacy, prevention of symptom progression, or AEs.

Conclusions

None of the drugs or drug combinations newly used to treat LUTS attributed to BPH showed outcomes superior to traditional AB treatment. Given the lack of superior outcomes, the studies' short time-horizon, and less assurance of their safety, their current value in treating LUTS attributable to BPH appears low.

Patient Summary

In this paper, we reviewed the evidence of newer drugs to treat men with urinary problems attributable to an enlarged prostate. We found none of the new drugs to be better but there was more concern about side effects.

### Efficacy and safety of adrenergic α-1 receptor antagonists in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis supporting the development of recommendations to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing [^67ba693b]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Adrenergic alpha-1 receptor antagonists (alpha-1 antagonists) are frequently used medications in the management of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and in the management of therapy-resistant arterial hypertension, two conditions frequently found in older adults. This systematic review aims at presenting a complete overview of evidence over the benefits and risks of alpha-1 antagonist treatment in people ≥ 65 years, and at deriving recommendations for a safe application of alpha-1 antagonists in older adults from the evidence found.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was performed (last update March 25 th 2022) including multiple databases (Medline/Pubmed, Embase, the Cochrane Library) and using the PICOS framework to define search terms. The selection of the studies was done by two independent reviewers in a two-step approach, followed by a systematic data extraction. Quality appraisal was performed for each study included using standardised appraisal tools. The studies retrieved and additional literature were used for the development of recommendations, which were rated for strength and quality according to the GRADE methodology.

Results

Eighteen studies were included: 3 meta-analyses, 6 randomised controlled trials and 9 observational trials. Doxazosin in the management of arterial hypertension was associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, particularly heart failure, than chlorthalidone. Regarding treatment of LUTS suggestive of BPH, alpha-1 antagonists appeared to be effective in the relief of urinary symptoms and improvement of quality of life. They seemed to be less effective in preventing disease progression. Analyses of the risk profile indicated an increase in vasodilation related adverse events and sexual adverse events for some agents. The risk of falls and fractures as well as the effects of long-term treatment remained unclear. All meta-analyses and 5 out of 6 interventional studies were downgraded in the quality appraisal. 7 out of 9 observational studies were of good quality.

Conclusions

It cannot be recommended to use doxazosin as first-line antihypertensive agent neither in older adults nor in younger patients. In the management of BPH alpha-1 antagonists promise to effectively relieve urinary symptoms with uncertainty regarding their efficacy in preventing long-term progression events.

### Tamsulosin treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia and risk of severe hypotension in men aged 40–85 years in the United States: risk window analyses using between and within patient methodology [^995aa5cf]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

A study in the US Food and Drug Administration's adverse events reporting system used data mining strategies of spontaneous reports to assess potential safety signals with α adrenergic antagonists. Concern for dizziness or vertigo and orthostatic hypotension were raised for tamsulosin in addition to alfuzosin, doxazosin, and terazosin. A recent Cochrane review also found higher rates of dizziness with larger tamsulosin dosages (0.8 mg, 17% dizziness; 0.4 mg, 9%; 0.2 mg, 3%), suggesting a dose dependent effect.

In a prospective cohort study of 5872 participants, Parsons and colleagues found a significantly increased risk of falls at one year in community dwelling men aged 65 years and older with moderate or severe lower urinary tract symptoms, based on the validated American Urological Association symptom index. But they did not find any difference when stratifying patients on the basis of use of urological drug treatments. However, all urological drugs were grouped together in the analysis (α blockers, 5ARIs, anticholinergics), and more importantly, drug use was only collected at baseline — therefore, a first dose phenomenon could not be assessed. The population based case-control study by Jacobsen and colleagues found an increased risk of hip fractures among men with benign prostatic hyperplasia taking α blockers but not 5ARIs. Notably, this risk was only observed in men initiating treatment with an α blocker within 30 days (odds ratio 2.04, 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 3.49). Our study suggests that this increased risk of hip fractures with α blockers use could be secondary to falls as a result of severe hypotensive events at initiation.

### The efficacy and safety of combined therapy with α-blockers and anticholinergics for men with benign prostatic hyperplasia: a meta-analysis [^5152fcf9]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

We performed a meta-analysis to compare treatment with α-blockers and anticholinergics (ie combination therapy) to α-blocker monotherapy to clarify the efficacy and safety of this treatment approach among men with storage urinary symptoms related to benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Materials and Methods

We searched for trials of men with benign prostatic hyperplasia/lower urinary tract symptoms that were randomized to combination treatment or α-blockers alone. We pooled data from 7 placebo controlled trials meeting inclusion criteria. Primary outcomes of interest included changes in International Prostate Symptom Score (storage subscores) and urinary frequency. We also assessed post-void residual volume, maximal flow rate and the incidence of urinary retention. Data were pooled using random effects models for continuous outcomes and the Peto method to generate odds ratios for acute urinary retention.

Results

Combination therapy had a significantly greater reduction in International Prostate Symptom Score storage subscores (Δ -0.73, 95% CI -1.09 - -0.37) and voiding frequency (Δ -0.69 voids, 95% CI -0.97 - -0.41). There was also a greater reduction in maximal urinary flow rate (Δ -0.59 mL per second, 95% CI -1.04 - -0.14) and increase in post-void residual urine volume (Δ 11.60 ml, 95% CI 8.50–14.70) with combination therapy. The number needed to treat with combination therapy to cause 1 acute urinary retention episode was 101 (95% CI 60–267).

Conclusions

Combination treatment with α-blockers and anticholinergics significantly improved storage voiding parameters compared to men treated with α-blocker therapy alone. This treatment approach is safe with a minimal risk of increased post-void residual urine volume, decreased maximal urinary flow rate or acute urinary retention.

### Cardiovascular outcomes of α-blockers vs 5-α reductase inhibitors for benign prostatic hyperplasia [^7ba3d149]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Our findings regarding HF potentially contrast with those of ALLHAT, wherein a 2-fold risk of incident HF led to discontinuation of the nonselective AB group. Initial hypotheses regarding adverse effects of doxazosin pointed to less effective blood pressure control in this population compared with individuals receiving chlorthalidone. However, further analyses did not support this. Apparent differences between the 2 studies also could arise from ALLHAT's examination of hospital and home-treated HF, whereas we considered only HF hospitalization. Furthermore, our cohort's mean age was approximately 7 years older than that of participants in ALLHAT and included only male patients with an established diagnosis of BPH, whereas ALLHAT included male and female participants.

Our finding that ABs were not associated with HF hospitalization risk may also appear to contrast with an RR of 1.10 among users of ABs compared with those using 5-ARIs reported by Lusty et al. However, the Ontario study focused on new diagnosis of HF, whereas we studied HF hospitalization. Furthermore, they indexed patients into the study at the time of BPH diagnosis, introducing potential selection bias that our approach avoids. A meta-analysis of randomized trials among patients with indications for ABs by Sousa et alfound that patients receiving ABs compared with those in active or placebo control groups had increased risk of acute HF (odds ratio = 1.78 [95% CI, 1.46–2.16]). They found no association with mortality (odds ratio = 1.10 [95% CI, 0.84–1.42]), although they did not analyze outcomes with respect to a relevant comparator group as we have done with patients taking 5-ARIs.

In contemporary practice, the most prescribed ABs for BPH are α-1A subtype-selective antagonists that have minimal impact on blood pressure. We found that increased risks of adverse cardiovascular outcomes were maintained when the exposure was limited to subtype-selective ABs in sensitivity analyses. This finding was unsurprising given that 141 398 ABs (86.3%) prescribed in our study were subtype selective. Collectively, these data align with the concept that activation of endogenous cardiac α1-A-ARs is cardioprotective, as demonstrated in preclinical studies.

### New alpha blockers to treat male lower urinary tract symptoms [^a81c8516]. Current Opinion in Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To date it is unclear whether the selectivity of new alpha-blockers to alpha-adrenergic receptor subtypes translates into more clinical benefits and less adverse effects in clinical practice. We performed a systematic review of the two new Abs silodosin and naftopidil. With the availability of numerous alpha-blockers to treat lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia, the findings of this review will be highly relevant to the field of urology.

Recent Findings

Silodosin was found to be more effective than placebo in improving International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and quality of life scores and as effective as other alpha-blockers. Although the incidence of cardiovascular adverse events of silodosin was similar compared with placebo and other alpha-blockers (tamsulosin, naftopidil, alfuzosin), the sexual adverse events were more common with silodosin. No placebo-controlled randomized trial exists investigating the effects of naftopidil in men with lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia. Naftopidil had similar efficacy with regards to IPSS and quality of life compared with tamsulosin. The rate of adverse events was similar compared with tamsulosin.

Summary

The two new selective alpha-blockers, silodosin, and naftopidil showed similar efficacy in IPSS and quality of life compared with other alpha-blockers. However, silodosin has more sexual adverse events.

### Assessment of frailty and association with progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms and serious adverse events among men using drug therapy [^975d3904]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Bladder outlet obstruction due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), the histological process that leads to an enlarged prostate, is a common cause of male lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Currently, one-third of men older than 75 years with newly diagnosed LUTS will receive BPH drug therapy, twice the rate of younger men.

Combination therapy with α-adrenergic-receptor antagonist (α-blocker) plus a 5α-reductase inhibitor has been the standard drug therapy for BPH for over 2 decades since the landmark Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) trial demonstrated lower rates of clinical BPH progression, primarily symptom progression and acute urinary retention, compared with men receiving placebo. Drug therapy decreases the risk of clinical BPH progression by decreasing smooth-muscle tone in the prostate and bladder neck (via α-blockers) and decreasing prostate volume (via 5α-reductase inhibitors). However, LUTS among older men with and without BPH are extremely common and heterogenous, with multifactorial causes, contributing to widespread and long-term use of BPH medications. Medical BPH therapy is also associated with several important adverse drug events that are particularly harmful for older men, including orthostatic hypotension, falls, depression, dementia, and suicidal ideation. Still unknown is whether there are identifiable subsets of older men (eg, those that are frail) for whom the risks of long-term drug therapy for BPH outweigh benefits.

Frailty, as defined by the accumulation of health and functional problems (ie, deficit accumulation frailty), is associated with morbidity and mortality because of a greater vulnerability to stressors and is considered a marker of biological, rather than chronological, age. Although associations between chronological age and male LUTS or BPH are well established, including data from the MTOPs trial, frailty and other markers of biological age may represent more important risk factors than chronological age alone. However, prior studies are limited by cross-sectional design, lack of a clinical diagnosis or objective measures of benign prostatic obstruction and frailty, BPH interventions that were neither randomized nor placebo controlled, and no formal interaction testing.

This cohort study using data from the MTOPS trial evaluates the longitudinal association of a deficit accumulation frailty index with risk of clinical BPH progression and serious adverse events (SAEs), using standardized definitions for both. We hypothesized that greater frailty index assessed at baseline would be independently associated with higher rates of both clinical BPH progression and SAE and that both associations would be highest among men receiving combination therapy.

### Managing benign prostatic hyperplasia [^18bca6dc]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Medical and surgical options for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia have expanded in recent years. Saw palmetto, the most widely used complementary medication, is less effective than standard medical therapy but has fewer side effects. Although non-selective alpha blockers provide rapid relief of symptoms and are relatively inexpensive, they can cause dizziness and orthostatic hypotension. These effects occur less often with tamsulosin, a more selective alpha blocker. Finasteride, a 5alpha-reductase inhibitor, slowly reduces prostatic volume but is not as effective as alpha blockers, especially in men with a smaller prostate. Dutasteride, a new 5alpha-reductase inhibitor, has recently been labeled for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Surgery may be appropriate initial treatment in patients with severe symptoms who are not at high risk for complications. Surgery may also be indicated in patients who have failed medical therapy or have recurrent infection, hematuria, or renal insufficiency. Transurethral resection of the prostate is effective in most patients, but it carries some risk of sexual dysfunction, incontinence, and bleeding. Surgical procedures that use thermal microwave or laser energy to reduce hyperplastic prostate tissue have recently become available. In general, the newer procedures are less expensive than transurethral resection of the prostate and have fewer complications; however, the need for retreatment is somewhat greater with these less invasive techniques.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) initial medical therapy — trial duration and next-step evaluation are specified as follows: "An initial trial of medical management over 4 weeks with an alpha blocker or PDE5, and over 6–12 months with a 5-ARI is reasonable in men with bothersome LUTS." "Referral to a specialist is recommended for men who either do not improve with medical management, or have symptomatic improvement but intolerable medication-related side effects." If "initial medical management does not lead to symptomatic improvement," clinicians should consider "performance of studies, such as urodynamics, to confirm BOO versus DO," noting that "Understanding the contribution of DO versus BOO can aid in patient counseling and in the selection of additional medication options." In men "with LUTS predominantly due to BPH," "procedural or surgical options may be considered," whereas in "complicated LUTS… additional medication classes should be considered along with procedural options."

Medical therapy — alpha blockers for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) — Clinicians should offer one of the following alpha blockers as a treatment option for patients with bothersome, moderate to severe LUTS/BPH: alfuzosin, doxazosin, silodosin, tamsulosin, or terazosin. (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A) Multiple phase III RCTs, Phase IV studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses have demonstrated the efficacy of alpha blockers for the treatment of LUTS and BPH, and there is nearly universal agreement that they are all relatively equally effective in terms of IPSS improvement, with an expected range of improvement of 5–8 points, compared to an expected effect of placebo from 2–4 points, with data demonstrating equal efficacy across all alpha blockers and no particular subset more or less suited for such treatment.

### Medical and minimally invasive therapies for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^dcd1ca01]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Over the last decade, management of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) has changed with a substantial decrease in the use of transurethral prostatectomy (TURP) and a simultaneous increase in the use of medical therapy and minimally invasive surgical therapy (MIST). The goal of management of this chronic progressive condition is not only to provide relief of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) but also to reduce the lifetime risk of adverse outcomes. Recent clinical evidence has demonstrated a clear role for medical therapy, particularly with 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) either alone or in combination with alpha-blockers, to reduce the risk of acute urinary retention and need for surgery and provide symptom relief. Clinical data on MISTs also indicate a more pronounced short-term effect; however, the long-term durability of these therapies remains uncertain. Minimally invasive surgical therapies confer treatment benefits in a single 1-h treatment session under local anesthesia. Recovery times and adverse events are improved compared with TURP, but issues such as hematuria, prolonged catheterization, urinary tract infection and retreatment remain commonly reported issues. Today, urologists are faced with the challenge of identifying the most appropriate treatment option for the long-term management of BPH. The initial choice for any given patient will depend on his presenting circumstances and the influence of treatment risks on these circumstances. Providing patients with informed treatment decisions is a key element of management.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) follow-up evaluation — patients should be evaluated by their providers 4–12 weeks after initiating treatment (provided adverse events do not require earlier consultation) to assess response to therapy, and reevaluation should include the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS); further evaluation may include a post-void residual (PVR) and uroflowmetry (Clinical Principle). For shorter duration of onset drugs such as alpha blockers, beta-3 agonists, PDE5s and anticholinergics the first follow-up visit can be as early as four weeks, whereas for longer acting drugs such as 5-ARIs, the first follow-up visit may be within three to six months if adverse events do not necessitate an earlier visit. During the follow-up visits, patients should be queried regarding the occurrence of typical adverse events of the medication taken, the IPSS and quality of life (QoL) score should be re-administered, and uroflowmetry and residual urine determination is advised. There are no thresholds in the literature for monitoring changes in PVR to help guide therapy, and there are no thresholds in the literature for monitoring changes in Qmax to help guide therapy; on average, an improvement between 1 and 5 mL/s may be expected, while other patients may experience no changes or even a minor deterioration. There are also no thresholds in the literature for monitoring changes in the IPSS/QoL to help guide therapy.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) 5‑alpha reductase inhibitors — gynecomastia: The multinational 4‑year REDUCE trial found an increased incidence of gynecomastia (1.9% versus 1.0%; ARD: 0.8; 95%CI: 0.3, 1.3), with a larger between‑group difference in the post hoc analysis of a subset of 1,617 men (2.4% versus 0.7%; ARD: 1.7; 95%CI: 0.5, 2.9). During the 2‑year observational extension phase conducted in 2,751 participants, no new cases of gynecomastia were reported. Conversely, a 2‑year study conducted in Asia did not demonstrate any increased risk of gynecomastia in men on dutasteride, and an observational study reported a greater incidence of gynecomastia in men who used finasteride or dutasteride, alone or with an alpha blocker, when compared to non‑exposure to LUTS/BPH medications.

### Who will benefit from combination therapy? The role of 5 alpha reductase inhibitors and alpha blockade: a reflection from MTOPS [^8e4e2a60]. Current Opinion in Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to revisit the medical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia in the light of the most recent data concerning the association of alpha-blockers and 5alpha-reductase inhibitors. Combining these two drugs is not a new concept in treating benign prostatic hyperplasia patients. Alpha blockers are believed to improve symptoms and flow rate by inducing relaxation of the smooth muscle neck and prostate area (dynamic component), while 5alpha-reductase inhibitors are believed to improve symptoms and flow rate by shrinking the transition zone of the prostate through hormonal mechanisms (static component). The proof of this concept, however, could not be clinically demonstrated up until now. The design of previous studies investigating combination therapy with the 5alpha-reductase inhibitor finasteride has been questionable.

Recent Findings

Extrapolated from the Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) study, not yet fully published, again raises the question of the effectiveness of such a combination. There is now some evidence to suggest that combining alpha-blockers and finasteride may be more effective in relieving and preventing the progression of symptoms than either of the two drugs alone.

Summary

Patients most likely to benefit from combination therapy are those in whom baseline risk of progression is significantly higher, generally patients with larger glands and higher prostatic specific antigen values.

### The risk of fall and fracture with the initiation of a prostate-selective α antagonist: a population based cohort study [^7fab1889]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

As men age, many will develop bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms such as urinary frequency, urgency, nocturia, and a weak urinary stream. These symptoms are often attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia and are treated because of their negative impact on quality of life. The introduction of several α antagonist medications in the 1990s fundamentally changed the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia and lower urinary tract symptoms. These medications relax the prostatic smooth muscle and improve urinary flow rates and symptoms.

Non-specific (first generation) α antagonists, such as doxazosin and terazosin, act on all α 1 receptor subtypes (α 1A, α 1B, α 1D) and are used for the treatment of both benign prostatic hyperplasia and hypertension. This non-selective α 1 receptor activity requires dose titration over 1–2 weeks to avoid symptomatic hypotension from α 1B antagonism. These non-specific α antagonists have generally fallen into disfavor as antihypertensives since the ALLHAT trial. In this randomized, double blind trial traditional antihypertensive medicines (including non-specific α antagonists) were compared with newer classes of antihypertensives; the doxazosin arm was stopped early because of a higher rate of cardiac dysfunction.

Similarly, among men with benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms, these non-specific α antagonists have largely been replaced by prostate-specific (second generation) α antagonists. These newer drugs do not need dose titration and are solely indicated for male urinary symptoms from benign prostatic hyperplasia. They include alfuzosin (which exhibits clinical uroselectivity), and tamsulosin and silodosin (which exhibit true α 1A receptor selectivity, which is the primary α receptor in the prostate). Their selectivity for the prostate hypothetically reduces the risk of hypotension due to reduced α 1B antagonism.

However, as a class, all α antagonists have been associated with side effects such as hypotension and dizziness. For this reason, α antagonists in general have been identified as a class of medication to discontinue in a patient who falls. However, this recommendation is primarily based on perceptions of the hypotension risk associated with non-specific α antagonists, and the potentially lower risk, prostate-specific drugs have not been widely studied. In addition, previous research has failed to demonstrate a consistent conclusion regarding the risk of falls and fractures with α antagonists used for benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms. Studies have both demonstratedand failed to demonstratethis risk.

### Alfuzosin for treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms compatible with benign prostatic hyperplasia: a systematic review of efficacy and adverse effects [^1b3aa5e7]. Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and adverse effects of alfuzosin for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

Methods

The included studies were randomized controlled trials involving men with symptomatic BPH treated with alfuzosin versus placebo or active control for at least 4 weeks.

Results

The search strategy identified 11 trials involving 3901 men with a mean age of 64 years. Eight trials were placebo-controlled studies, two were alfuzosin versus alternative alpha-blockers, and one was alfuzosin versus finasteride and combination alfuzosin/finasteride therapy. The study durations were short term, 4 to 26 weeks. The mean baseline symptom scores and peak urinary flow rates were indicative of moderate BPH. Alfuzosin (7.5 or 10 mg) improved lower urinary tract symptoms assessed by the International Prostate Symptom Score compared with placebo. The mean absolute change from baseline was -5.4 points for alfuzosin compared with -3.6 points for placebo, a weighted mean difference of 1.8 points (three studies). Alfuzosin increased the peak urinary flow more than did placebo, although the improvement varied across the eight studies. Symptom and flow improvements were generally comparable to that with combination therapy and with other alpha1-blockers. Alfuzosin had good short-term tolerability, and the numbers of study withdrawals were comparable to those with placebo and controls. Efficacy and short-term safety were similar across the various (immediate-release, sustained, and once-daily) formulations.

Conclusions

The results from short-term studies have indicated that alfuzosin improves lower urinary tract symptoms and urinary flow more than does placebo and is generally well tolerated in men with symptomatic BPH. Long-term efficacy and safety studies in combination with a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor should be initiated.

### Are all α-blockers created equal? An update [^31b30f41]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

alpha-Receptor blockers, used to treat lower urinary tract symptoms, exert effects on areas of the body other than the prostate where alpha-receptors are located, including the blood vessels and the central nervous system. alpha-Receptors in the central and peripheral nervous system may be involved in bladder activation. alpha(1a)-Receptors are the appropriate target in men with obstructive symptoms, although alpha(1d)-receptors may also be important in patients with irritative symptoms. There is conflicting evidence about the selectivity of alpha-blockers. Clinical trials of these agents do not necessarily reflect results observed in animal and laboratory studies on uroselectivity. The few published comparator studies of alpha-blockers indicate similar efficacies, although side-effect profiles differ somewhat. Randomized, controlled studies of different alpha-blockers with sufficient power to detect differences in side effects between agents are needed.

### Lower urinary tract symptoms / benign prostatic hyperplasia: minimizing morbidity caused by treatment [^ced976dc]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

The beneficial effects of treatment for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), or LUTS/BPH, have to be balanced against the morbidity associated with treatment. Invasive surgery, such as transurethral resection of the prostate, has been associated with irreversible complications (eg, impotence and retrograde ejaculation). Alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists provide effective and fast relief of LUTS/BPH. In contrast to finasteride, they are not associated with sexual dysfunction (eg, decreased libido or impotence). Alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists induce adverse events associated with interference with blood pressure regulation. The alpha(1A)/alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor antagonist tamsulosin has the lowest potential to interfere with blood pressure regulation and induce related adverse events. In addition, tamsulosin seems to be as well tolerated as phytotherapy, except for a higher incidence of abnormal ejaculation. Abnormal ejaculation occurs in 4% to 11% of patients receiving a alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, which is, however, well tolerated; < 1% of patients discontinue because of this adverse event. In placebo-controlled trials, abnormal ejaculation has been predominantly reported for tamsulosin, but in most direct comparative studies, the incidence was comparable to that of other alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists. Men with LUTS/BPH have an increased risk of impaired sexual function. However, alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists, such as tamsulosin, may slightly improve sexual dysfunction together with LUTS problems. Combination therapy of an alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist and finasteride has a similar adverse-event profile as each monotherapy, except for an increased risk of abnormal ejaculation. The discontinuation rate because of adverse events does not seem to be higher than with monotherapy. Medical therapies, and particularly alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists such as tamsulosin, can be considered a first-line treatment option for LUTS/BPH because they provide effective relief of bothersome LUTS with excellent tolerability.

### Silodosin: a selective alpha1A-adrenergic receptor antagonist for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^fb2addf7]. Clinical Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Silodosin is a new alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor antagonist that is selective for the alpha(1A)-adrenergic receptor. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2008 for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

Objective

This article reviews the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, drug interactions, and dosage and administration of silodosin in adult male patients with BPH.

Methods

A search of MEDLINE (1950-October 8, 2009), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-October 8, 2009), and the Iowa Drug Information Service database (1966-October 8, 2009) was conducted using the terms silodosin, KMD-3213, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor antagonist. Reports of research and review articles published in English were identified and evaluated, and the bibliographies of these articles were reviewed for additional relevant publications. A search of the FDA Web site was performed, and abstracts and posters presented at scientific meetings of the American Urological Association were reviewed.

Results

By antagonizing alpha(1A)-adrenergic receptors in the prostate and urethra, silodosin causes smooth muscle relaxation in the LUT. Silodosin has greater affinity for the alpha(1A)-adrenergic receptor than for the alpha(1B)-adrenergic receptor (by a factor of 583), minimizing the propensity for blood pressure-related adverse effects mediated by alpha(1B) blockade. In 3 controlled clinical studies in patients with BPH-related LUTS (1 published; 2 presented in the prescribing information and published in a pooled analysis), patients receiving silodosin at a total daily dose of 8 mg had significant improvements in the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and maximum urinary flow rate (Q(max)) compared with those receiving placebo (both, P < 0.05). The most commonly reported adverse effect was abnormal or retrograde ejaculation (> 22%), and the incidence of orthostatic hypotension was low (< 3%).

Conclusions

In the small number of clinical trials reviewed, silodosin was associated with significant reductions in IPSS and Q(max) compared with placebo. To determine whether silodosin's selectivity for the alpha(1A)-adrenergic receptor translates into a clinical advantage relative to other available agents, long-term studies evaluating the comparative efficacy and tolerability of silodosin and other alpha(1)-blockers (specifically tamsulosin) are necessary.

### Alfuzosin for symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia: long-term experience [^1feda590]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Evidence of the long-term efficacy and safety of alfuzosin treatment for LUTS indicative of BPH was examined.

Materials and Methods

An English literature search of MEDLINE, PubMed and proceedings from scientific meetings from 1974 to 2004 was done. Search terms included benign prostatic hyperplasia, alfuzosin, treatment, alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor blocker, long-term, followup, lower urinary tract symptoms, complications or adverse events, sexual, retention and cardiovascular.

Results

Currently alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor blocking agents are first line treatment for BPH. Although all alpha-blocking compounds show similar levels of efficacy for LUTS treatment, newer agents such as alfuzosin tend to demonstrate improved selectivity for the prostate and bladder with few vasodilatory effects and they have tolerability advantages over older alpha-blocking compounds. Immediate, sustained and newer extended release alfuzosin formulations significantly improve LUTS indicative of BPH but extended release alfuzosin may be more convenient to administer and it tends to show better vasodilatory tolerability than the older immediate release formulation.

Conclusions

When used to treat BPH, alfuzosin provides symptom relief, decreased residual post-void urine volume and a decreased risk of acute urinary retention, which are maintained during long-term use. Most vasodilatory side effects occur early in treatment and they become less frequent thereafter. Patient quality of life also improves with maximal improvements observed after 12 months of treatment. Continued study will further clarify the physiological, clinical and personal benefits produced by alfuzosin when used for the management of LUTS indicative of BPH.

Ejaculatory dysfunction (EjD) with alpha blockers — It has long been understood that alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade may induce EjD, and those drugs more selective for the alpha 1a versus the alpha 1b receptor are more prone to induce EjD (i.e., tamsulosin, silodosin); in a recent comprehensive meta-analysis, EjD events were significantly more common with alpha blockers than with placebo (7.7% versus 1.1%; OR: 5.88; P < 0.0001).

### Effect of dutasteride on clinical progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia in asymptomatic men with enlarged prostate: a post hoc analysis of the REDUCE study [^e57e072b]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

The choice of treatment for symptomatic patients is often based on prostate size: α blocker monotherapy for patients with small prostates and combination therapy of 5α reductase inhibitors plus α blockers for patients with enlarged prostates. Obviously, asymptomatic men with small prostates do not require any treatment. However, it is not uncommon in clinical practice to encounter men with enlarged prostates but minimal lower urinary tract symptoms. These men are identified because of digital rectal examination or transrectal ultrasound findings for men with elevated prostate specific antigen levels. Because these patients have not been included in pivotal trials of treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia, both the risk of clinical progression and the potential benefit of preventive treatment with 5α reductase inhibitors are unknown. The Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) cancer prevention trialis a large multinational prospective randomised study that measured prostate volume and urinary symptoms at baseline and included men with minimal or no lower urinary tract symptoms. We can therefore use this dataset to determine if there is any role for 5α reductase inhibitors in the treatment of asymptomatic men with enlarged prostates.

### Tamsulosin treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia and risk of severe hypotension in men aged 40–85 years in the United States: risk window analyses using between and within patient methodology [^32ba62e8]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

A comparison of hypotension risk with tamsulosin to other α blockers would be of clinical interest, but low use of other α blockers for benign prostatic hyperplasia and confounding by a coindication for hypertension would decrease interpretability of this comparison. In our study, we used two analytical techniques to increase robustness of our study results. The magnitude of the point estimates were not completely synonymous using the cohort and self controlled case series approaches, particularly with regards to weeks 9–12 of new tamsulosin use. These differences are probably attributable to differences in the underlying number of person years in each risk window of exposure among all patients (cohort analysis) versus only those who experienced outcomes (self controlled case series analysis), and to differences in the reference comparator for these techniques. However, both analyses agreed on time varying risks of larger magnitude at new use and restarting tamsulosin treatment than observed with maintenance treatment. Future work is needed to determine whether genetic characteristics or other non-measured risk factors may modify susceptibility to hypotension with tamsulosin.

### Medical therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia: sexual dysfunction and impact on quality of life [^cd5fba93]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2003). Low credibility.

Therapies for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) may either improve or exacerbate sexual function with an ensuing impact on quality of life. Here we review a total of 73 papers on medical therapies for BPH with a focus on the effects of different pharmacological agents on sexual function. For example, certain alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor blockers may improve erectile function; however, ejaculatory dysfunction with one of these agents, tamsulosin, occurs at a rate of 4–18%, rising to 30% with long-term use. In addition, treatment with the 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor finasteride is associated with problems of ejaculation (2.1–7.7%), erection (4.9–15.8%), and libido (3.1–5.4%). Such significant and undesirable complications in relation to sexual function produce a well-documented negative impact on quality of life. Thus, optimal treatment for men with BPH requires the use of agents that demonstrate efficacy and safety with fewer sexual side effects.

### Cardiac failure associated with medical therapy of benign prostatic hyperplasia: a population based study [^70b95bf1]. The Journal of Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Increased risk of cardiac failure with α-blockers in hypertension studies and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors in prostate studies have raised safety concerns for long term management of benign prostatic hyperplasia. The objective of this study was to determine if these medications are associated with an increased risk of cardiac failure in routine care.

Materials and Methods

This population based study used administrative databases including all men over 66 with a diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia between 2005 and 2015. Men were categorized based on 5-alpha reductase inhibitor exposure and/or α-blocker exposure with a primary outcome of new cardiac failure utilizing competing risk models. Explanatory variables examined included exposure thresholds, formulations, age, and comorbidities associated with cardiac disease.

Results

The data set included 175,201 men with a benign prostatic hyperplasia diagnosis with 8,339, 55,383, and 41,491 exposed to 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, α-blocker and combination therapy, respectively. Men treated with 5-alpha reductase inhibitor and α-blocker, alone or in combination, had a statistically increased risk of being diagnosed with cardiac failure compared to no medication use. Cardiac failure risk was highest for α-blockers alone (HR 1.22; 95% CI 1.18–1.26), intermediate for combination α-blockers/5-alpha reductase inhibitors (HR 1.16; 95% CI 1.12–1.21) and lowest for 5-alpha reductase inhibitors alone (HR 1.09; 95% CI 1.02–1.17). Nonselective α-blocker had a higher risk of cardiac failure than selective α-blockers (HR 1.08; 95% CI 1.00–1.17).

Conclusions

In routine care, men with a benign prostatic hyperplasia diagnosis and exposed to both 5-alpha reductase inhibitor and α-blocker therapy had an increased association with cardiac failure, with the highest risk for men exposed to nonselective α-blockers.

### Prostate cancer incidence and mortality in men exposed to α ₁-adrenergic receptor antagonists [^f4f83013]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2024). Medium credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common age-related medical condition among men. It affects up to 50% of men older than age 50 years and up to 80% of men older than age 80 years, leading to lower urinary tract symptoms. BPH prevalence is increasing, largely because of rising modifiable metabolic risk factors such as obesity. Medical treatment often involves α1-adrenergic receptor antagonists to relax the smooth muscles at the bladder neck and prostatic urethra by blocking sympathetic activity at these sites.

α1-Adrenergic receptor antagonists target 2 types of α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist receptors: α1A and α1B. Adrenoceptors are G-protein–coupled receptors, functionally bound by catecholamines: epinephrine and norepinephrine. The α1A subtype primarily regulates the contraction of smooth muscles in the prostatic urethra and bladder neck; the α1B subtype mainly controls muscle contraction in peripheral blood vessels. Prazosin was the first selective α1A blocker but has largely been replaced by US Food and Drug Administration–approved longer-acting α1-adrenergic receptor antagonists, such as terazosin, doxazosin, tamsulosin, and alfuzosin. The selective α1A antagonists have fewer cardiovascular side effects and are preferred for lower urinary tract symptoms associated with BPH. Silodosin is a newer selective α1A antagonist with a significantly greater affinity for the α1A receptor than the α1B receptor, making it a promising option with fewer side effects.

### Effect of dutasteride on clinical progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia in asymptomatic men with enlarged prostate: a post hoc analysis of the REDUCE study [^b84fb516]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Implications of study results

Treating asymptomatic patients is not an uncommon approach in medicine. Primary prevention with drugs is used to prevent cardiovascular complications and to reduce the risk of cardiac events. While not as lethal, the 10 year cumulative risk of acute urinary retention is estimated to be twice that of stroke or myocardial infarction. Further, research has found an episode of urinary retention to have a substantial impact on patients' health related quality of life. Lower urinary tract symptoms affect almost three quarters men in their 60s, and direct costs in the US exceed $1bn a year, excluding outpatient prescription costs. For men found to have a large prostate gland during routine rectal examination or imaging, this information may be used to select those for whom preventive medication may improve their quality of life and also yield economic benefits.

The trade-offs to the patient in this scenario are the side effects and cost of treatment. Side effects (table 3) include erectile dysfunction, decreased ejaculate volume, decreased libido, and gynaecomastia. Despite a greater patient preference against sexual side effects among those with mild symptoms, trade-off questionnaires suggest men prefer 5α reductase inhibitors compared with no treatment or α blockers. The concern over risk of high grade prostate cancer remains an issue of controversy, though the incidence of high grade cancer seems to be lower relative to small prostate glands. The current drug costs of dutasteride per patient in the UK are £238 a year (€281, $365), with total direct costs estimated at £325 per year. A recent cost effectiveness study suggested that lifelong monotherapy with dutasteride in unselected patients has a cost per QALY gained of €7274. Our data suggest that its preventive use in asymptomatic men with enlarged prostates would have a lower cost per QALY, given the similar relative risk reduction used in this cost analysis and the significantly higher incidence of complications related to benign prostatic hyperplasia in our study population. By comparison, the estimated cost of transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) in the NHS was £2080, and the estimated cost of one admission for acute urinary retention was £1040. However, cost effectiveness research to assess the use of dutasteride as a preventive agent in this population is unlikely to occur given that its patent expires in 2013. While some patients will not generally be receptive to preventive drug treatment, the magnitude of risk reduction seen in our study warrants further study of patient preferences for choosing optimal management. Certainly, the potential relative harms to each patient need to be discussed and weighed against the expected potential benefits.

### Tamsulosin for benign prostatic hyperplasia [^24e6eced]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a nonmalignant enlargement of the prostate which can result in bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms. The treatment goal for men with BPH is to relieve these bothersome symptoms.

Objectives

This systematic review assessed the effects of tamsulosin in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) compatible with BPH.

Search Strategy

Trials were searched in computerized general and specialized databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library), by checking bibliographies, and by contacting manufacturers and researchers.

Selection Criteria

Trials were eligible if they (1) randomized men with BPH to receive tamsulosin in comparison with placebo, other BPH medications or surgical interventions and (2) included clinical outcomes such as urologic symptom scales, symptoms, or urodynamic measurements, and (3) had a treatment duration of 30 days or longer. Eligibility was assessed by at least two independent observers.

Data Collection and Analysis

Information on patients, interventions, and outcomes were extracted by at least two independent reviewers using a standard form. The main outcome measure for comparing the effectiveness of tamsulosin with placebo, medical or surgical interventions was the change in urologic symptom scale scores. Secondary outcomes included changes in urinary flow measures (peak urine flow rate). The main outcome measure for adverse effects was the number of men reporting adverse effects.

Main Results

Fourteen studies involving 4,122 subjects met inclusion criteria. Study duration ranged from 4–26 weeks, and no placebo-controlled study lasted longer than 13 weeks. The mean age of subjects was 64 years. Baseline symptom scores and urine flow rates demonstrated that men had moderate LUTS. Tamsulosin improved symptoms and peak urine flow relative to placebo. The weighted mean differences (WMD) for mean change from baseline for the Boyarsky symptom score for 0.4 mg and 0.8 mg doses of tamsulosin relative to placebo were -1.1 points (95% CI = -1.49, -0.72; 12% improvement) and -1.6 points (95% CI = -2.3, -1.0; 16% improvement), respectively. The WMD for mean change from baseline in peak urine flow were 1.1 mL/sec (95% CI = 0.59, 1.51) and 1.1 mL/sec (95% CI = 0.65, 1.48) for 0.4 mg and 0.8 mg, respectively. Tamsulosin (0.2 mg-0.4 mg) was as effective as other alpha antagonists and the phytotherapeutic agent Permixon in improving symptoms and flow rates though the doses of all alpha-antagonists studied may not have been optimal. Discontinuations from treatment for any reason and discontinuations "due to adverse events" were similar in the low dose tamsulosin (0.2 mg) and placebo groups but increased to 16% in trials utilizing a 0.8 mg dose of tamsulosin. Low dose tamsulosin was generally well tolerated although not all the trials reported specific adverse events. The most frequently reported adverse events that were significantly greater than placebo included dizziness, rhinitis and abnormal ejaculation. Adverse effects increased markedly as tamsulosin dosing increased, and were reported in 75% of men receiving the 0.8 mg dose. Men receiving a 0.2 mg dose tamsulosin were less likely to discontinue treatment compared to men receiving terazosin.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Tamsulosin provided a small to moderate improvement in urinary symptoms and flow compared to men receiving placebo in men with BPH. Effectiveness was similar to other alpha antagonists and increased only slightly with higher doses. Long term effectiveness and ability to reduce complications due to BPH progression could not be determined. Adverse effects were generally mild but their frequency, including withdrawals, increased substantially with the higher doses that are generally available for treatment.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) combination therapy — In an Asian cohort using a 0.2 mg tamsulosin dose, men with characteristics of disease progression had better symptomatic benefit from combination therapy than tamsulosin monotherapy, with a 24-month study reporting more prominent improvements in maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax) and prostate volume reduction and reductions in the risk of acute urinary retention (AUR) and BPH related surgery; another study found that initial combination dutasteride and tamsulosin improved quality of life compared to later initiation of tamsulosin after disease progression; Providers may start combination therapy with the intention of later discontinuing the alpha blocker (sometimes called "Withdrawal Therapy"). While this is a reasonable strategy, the concept has not been studied rigorously, and there are insufficient data to gauge the utility of this approach or the duration at which combination therapy should be continued before cessation of the alpha blocker. As stated previously, providers do not need to obtain a PSA solely for determination of 5-ARI efficacy as part combination therapy, although knowledge of a pre-existing value may help guide treatment options.

### WITHDRAWN: tamsulosin for benign prostatic hyperplasia [^17e8ae24]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a nonmalignant enlargement of the prostate which can result in bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms. The treatment goal for men with BPH is to relieve these bothersome symptoms.

Objectives

This systematic review assessed the effects of tamsulosin in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) compatible with BPH.

Search Strategy

Trials were searched in computerized general and specialized databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library), by checking bibliographies, and by contacting manufacturers and researchers.

Selection Criteria

Trials were eligible if they (1) randomized men with BPH to receive tamsulosin in comparison with placebo, other BPH medications or surgical interventions and (2) included clinical outcomes such as urologic symptom scales, symptoms, or urodynamic measurements, and (3) had a treatment duration of 30 days or longer. Eligibility was assessed by at least two independent observers.

Data Collection and Analysis

Information on patients, interventions, and outcomes were extracted by at least two independent reviewers using a standard form. The main outcome measure for comparing the effectiveness of tamsulosin with placebo, medical or surgical interventions was the change in urologic symptom scale scores. Secondary outcomes included changes in urinary flow measures (peak urine flow rate). The main outcome measure for adverse effects was the number of men reporting adverse effects.

Main Results

Fourteen studies involving 4122 subjects met inclusion criteria. Study duration ranged from 4 to 26 weeks, and no placebo-controlled study lasted longer than 13 weeks. The mean age of subjects was 64 years. Baseline symptom scores and urine flow rates demonstrated that men had moderate LUTS. Tamsulosin improved symptoms and peak urine flow relative to placebo. The weighted mean differences (WMD) for mean change from baseline for the Boyarsky symptom score for 0.4 mg and 0.8 mg doses of tamsulosin relative to placebo were -1.1 points (95% CI = -1.49 to -0.72; 12% improvement) and -1.6 points (95% CI = -2.3 to -1.0; 16% improvement), respectively. The WMD for mean change from baseline in peak urine flow were 1.1 mL/sec (95% CI = 0.59 to 1.51) and 1.1 mL/sec (95% CI = 0.65 to 1.48) for 0.4 mg and 0.8 mg, respectively. Tamsulosin (0.2 mg to 0.4 mg) was as effective as other alpha antagonists and the phytotherapeutic agent Permixon® in improving symptoms and flow rates though the doses of all alpha-antagonists studied may not have been optimal. Discontinuations from treatment for any reason and discontinuations "due to adverse events" were similar in the low dose tamsulosin (0.2 mg) and placebo groups but increased to 16% in trials utilizing a 0.8 mg dose of tamsulosin. Low dose tamsulosin was generally well tolerated although not all the trials reported specific adverse events. The most frequently reported adverse events that were significantly greater than placebo included dizziness, rhinitis and abnormal ejaculation. Adverse effects increased markedly as tamsulosin dosing increased, and were reported in 75% of men receiving the 0.8 mg dose. Men receiving a 0.2 mg dose tamsulosin were less likely to discontinue treatment compared to men receiving terazosin.

Authors' Conclusions

Tamsulosin provided a small to moderate improvement in urinary symptoms and flow compared to men receiving placebo in men with BPH. Effectiveness was similar to other alpha antagonists and increased only slightly with higher doses. Long term effectiveness and ability to reduce complications due to BPH progression could not be determined. Adverse effects were generally mild but their frequency, including withdrawals, increased substantially with the higher doses that are generally available for treatment.

### Long-term risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia-related surgery and acute urinary retention in men treated with 5-alpha reductase inhibitor versus α-blocker monotherapy in routine clinical care [^9264a315]. The Prostate (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To assess the risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)-related surgery and acute urinary retention (AUR) in men treated with 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor (5-ARI) versus alpha-blocker monotherapy in routine clinical care over 15 years of follow-up.

Methods

Using population-based Danish Health registries, we identified all new-users of 5-ARI or alpha-blocker monotherapy in Denmark, 1997–2017. We defined an index date 180 days after the date of first prescription and included men who redeemed at least one additional prescription before the index date. We used multiple imputation to replace missing prostate-specific antigen values. We performed propensity score-weighted Cox regression to estimate weighted hazard ratios (wHRs) and cumulative incidence function to estimate weighted cumulative risks of BPH-related surgery and AUR in intention to treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analyses.

Results

We included 18,421 and 95,984 men treated with 5-ARI and alpha-blocker monotherapy, respectively. Overall, treatment with 5-ARI monotherapy was associated with a reduced risk of BPH-related surgery (ITT wHR = 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.68–0.78), PP wHR = 0.77 (95% CI: 0.70–0.84) and AUR (ITT wHR = 0.73 (95% CI: 0.67–0.78), PP wHR = 0.75 (95% CI: 0.66–0.84). The 15-year risk of BPH-related surgery in men treated with 5-ARI versus alpha-blocker monotherapy was 14.8% (95% CI: 14.1%-15.5%) versus 19.1% (95% CI: 18.7%-19.5%) in the ITT analysis and 13.8% (95% CI: 12.6%-14.9%) versus 17.5% (95% CI: 16.9%-18.0%) in the PP analysis. The 15-year risk of AUR in men treated with 5-ARI versus alpha-blocker was 13.0% (95% CI: 12.3%-13.6%) versus 16.6% (95% CI: 16.3%-17.0%) in the ITT analysis and 12.6% (95%: 11.3%-14.0%) versus 16.9% (95% CI: 16.3%-17.6%) in the PP analysis.

Conclusion

Treatment with 5-ARI versus alpha-blocker monotherapy in routine clinical care was associated with a reduced risk of BPH-related surgery and AUR for up to 15 years of follow-up. After 15 years of follow-up, the relative risk reduction was 21%-25% and the absolute risk reduction was 4%.

### Finasteride for benign prostatic hyperplasia [^7a312167]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a non-malignant enlargement of the prostate in aging men, can cause bothersome urinary symptoms (intermittency, weak stream, straining, urgency, frequency, incomplete emptying). Finasteride, a five-alpha reductase inhibitor (5ARI), blocks the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, reduces prostate size, and is commonly used to treat symptoms associated with BPH.

Objectives

To compare the clinical effectiveness and harms of finasteride versus placebo and active controls in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Library (which includes CDSR (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews), DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects), HTA (Heath Technology Assessments), and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and which includes EMBASE and MEDLINE), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information) and Google Scholar for randomized, controlled trials (RCTs). We also handsearched systematic reviews, references, and clinical-practice guidelines.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials in the English language with placebo and/or active arms with a duration of at least 6 months.

Data Collection and Analysis

JT extracted the data, which included patient characteristics, outcomes, and harms. Our primary outcome was change in a validated, urinary symptom-scale score, such as the AUA/IPSS. A clinically meaningful change was defined as 4 points. We also categorized outcomes by trial lengths of ≤ 1 year (short term) and > 1 year (long term).

Main Results

Finasteride consistently improved urinary symptom scores more than placebo in trials of > 1 year duration, and significantly lowered the risk of BPH progression (acute urinary retention, risk of surgical intervention, ≥ 4 point increase in the AUASI/IPSS). In comparison to alpha-blocker monotherapy, finasteride was less effective than either doxazosin or terazosin, but equally effective compared to tamsulosin. Both doxazosin and terazosin were significantly more likely than finasteride to improve peak urine flow and nocturia, versus finasteride. Versus tamsulosin, peak urine flow and QoL improved equally well versus finasteride. However, finasteride was associated with a lower risk of surgical intervention compared to doxazosin, but not to terazosin, while finasteride and doxazosin were no different for risk of acute urinary retention. Two small trials reported no difference in urinary symptom scores between finasteride and tamsulosin. Finasteride + doxazosin and doxazosin monotherapy improved urinary symptoms equally well (≥ 4 point improvement). For finasteride, there was an increased risk of ejaculation disorder, impotence, and lowered libido, versus placebo. Versus doxazosin, finasteride had a lower risk of asthenia, dizziness, and postural hypotension, and versus terazosin, finasteride had a significant, lower risk of asthenia, dizziness, and postural hypotension.

Authors' Conclusions

Finasteride improves long-term urinary symptoms versus placebo, but is less effective than doxazosin. Long-term combination therapy with alpha blockers (doxazosin, terazosin) improves symptoms significantly better than finasteride monotherapy. Finasteride + doxazosin improves symptoms equally - and clinically - to doxazosin alone. In comparison to doxazosin, finasteride + doxazosin appears to improve urinary symptoms only in men with medium (25 to < 40 mL) or large prostates (≥ 40 mL), but not in men with small prostates (25 mL). Comparing short to long-term therapy, finasteride does not improve symptoms significantly better than placebo at the short term, but in the long term it does, although the magnitude of differences was very small (from < 1.0 point to 2.2 points). Doxazosin improves symptoms better than finasteride both short and long term, with the magnitude of differences ∼2.0 points and 1.0 point, respectively. Finasteride + doxazosin improves scores versus finasteride alone at both short and long term, with mean differences ∼2.0 points for both time points. Finasteride + doxazosin versus doxazosin improves scores equally for short and long term. Drug-related adverse effects for finasteride are rare; nevertheless, men taking finasteride are at increased risk for impotence, erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and ejaculation disorder, versus placebo. Versus doxazosin, which has higher rates of dizziness, postural hypotension, and asthenia, men taking finasteride are at increased risk for impotence, erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and ejaculation disorder. Finasteride significantly reduces asthenia, postural hypotension, and dizziness versus terazosin. Finasteride significantly lowers the risk of asthenia, dizziness, ejaculation disorder, and postural hypotension, versus finasteride + terazosin.

### Tamsulosin treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia and risk of severe hypotension in men aged 40–85 years in the United States: risk window analyses using between and within patient methodology [^b961a2d2]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Benign prostatic hyperplasia is an enlargement of the transition zone of the prostate that can cause lower urinary tract symptoms and could lead to bladder outlet obstruction in men. Lower urinary tract symptoms can include urinary frequency, urgency, hesitancy, or nocturia, and can result in a marked decrease in quality of life. It has been estimated that 50% of men in the United States over the age of 50 have this condition.

First line medical treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia consists of α1 adrenergic receptor antagonists (α blockers) and 5α reductase inhibitors (5ARI). α blockers relieve bladder outlet obstruction by relaxing the periurethral prostatic smooth muscle and allowing for improved urinary flow. 5ARIs have shown to reduce disease progression, prevent complications from benign prostatic hyperplasia (including acute urinary retention and prostate related surgery), and improve lower urinary tract symptoms starting after six months of treatment. Although effective, when initiated, α blockers can induce marked orthostatic hypotension and syncope. This effect was labeled the "first dose phenomenon" by Bendall and colleagues in men using prazosin in 1975, and subsequently has been reported in antagonists to the α1 adrenergic receptor, terazosin and doxazosin. This effect is a consequence of inadvertent vasodilation and a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. A recent study found an increased risk of hip fracture among men taking α blockers but not 5ARIs, suggesting that it may have resulted from an increased risk of hypotension induced falls. Tamsulosin is a uroselective α blocker owing to its selectivity as an α1a receptor antagonist, which is the predominant receptor that mediates prostate smooth muscle tension. Compared to non-selective α1 blockers such as terazosin and doxazosin, tamsulosin has a lower rate of asthenia, dizziness, and severe hypotension in clinical trials. As a result, it has a warning for hypotension and syncope, but not a black box warning similar to less selective α blockers in its class.

It is unknown whether tamsulosin treatment induces a first dose phenomenon in clinical practice and confers increased risk for hypotension, requiring admission to hospital immediately after initiating or restarting drug treatment. Our study aimed to characterize the risk of severe hypotension at time varying intervals during the course of tamsulosin treatment in middle aged and older men with benign prostatic hyperplasia.

### Naftopidil for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms compatible with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^01802d40]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common condition in ageing men that may cause lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Treatment aims are to relieve symptoms and prevent disease-related complications. Naftopidil is an alpha-blocker (AB) that has a high affinity for the A1d receptor that may have advantages in treating LUTS in this setting. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2009. Since that time, several large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been reported, making this update relevant.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of naftopidil for the treatment of LUTS associated with BPH.

Search Methods

We performed a comprehensive search using multiple databases (the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, LILAC, and Web of Science), trials registries, other sources of grey literature, and conference proceedings with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status up to 31 May 2018 SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all parallel RCTs. We also included cross-over design trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently classified and abstracted data from the included studies. We performed statistical analyses using a random-effects model and interpreted them according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Primary outcomes were urological symptom scores, quality of life (QoL) and treatment withdrawals for any reason; secondary outcomes were treatment withdrawals due to adverse events, acute urinary retention, surgical intervention for BPH, and cardiovascular and sexual adverse events. We considered outcomes measured up to 12 months after randomisation as short term, and later than 12 months as long term. We rated the certainty of the evidence according to the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 22 RCTs with 2223 randomised participants across four comparisons for short-term follow-up. This abstract focuses on only two of four comparisons for which we found data since two comparators (i.e. propiverine and Eviprostat (phytotherapy)) are rarely used. One study comparing naftopidil to placebo did not report any relevant outcomes and was therefore excluded. There were no trials that compared to combination therapy with naftopidil or any 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) to combination therapy with other ABs and any 5-ARIs. All included studies were conducted in Asian countries. Study duration ranged from four to 12 weeks. Mean age was 67.8 years, prostate volume was 35.4 mL, and International Prostate Symptom Score was 18.3. We were unable to perform any of the preplanned subgroup analyses based on age and baseline symptom score. Naftopidil versus tamsulosinBased on 12 studies with 965 randomised participants, naftopidil may have resulted in little or no difference in urological symptom score (mean difference (MD) 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.09 to 1.04 measured on a scale from 0 to 35 with higher score representing increased symptoms), QoL (MD 0.11, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.30; measured on a scale from 0 to 6 with higher scores representing worse QoL), and treatment withdrawals for any reason (risk ratio (RR) 0.92, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.34; corresponding to 7 fewer per 1000 participants, 95% CI 32 fewer to 31 more). Naftopidil may have resulted in little to no difference in sexual adverse events (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.22); this would result in 26 fewer sexual adverse events per 1000 participants (95% CI 43 fewer to 13 more). We rated the certainty of evidence as moderate for urological symptom score and low for the other outcomes. Naftopidil versus silodosinBased on five studies with 652 randomised participants, naftopidil may have resulted in little or no difference in the urological symptom scores (MD 1.04, 95% CI -0.78 to 2.85), QoL (MD 0.21, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.66), and treatment withdrawals for any reason (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.23; corresponding to 26 fewer per 1000 participants, 95% CI 62 fewer to 32 more). We rated the certainty of evidence as low for all these outcomes. Naftopidil likely reduced sexual adverse events (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.42; corresponding to 126 fewer sexual adverse events per 1000 participants, 95% CI 139 fewer to 86 fewer). We rated the certainty of evidence as moderate for sexual adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

Naftopidil appears to have similar effects in the urological symptom scores and QoL compared to tamsulosin and silodosin. Naftopidil has similar sexual adverse events compared to tamsulosin but has fewer compared to silodosin.

### Efficacy and safety of adrenergic α-1 receptor antagonists in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis supporting the development of recommendations to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing [^6c58d876]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Alpha-1 antagonists are widely used agents predominantly in the treatment of arterial hypertension and, since the late 1980s and early 1990s, LUTS suggestive of BPH. Both conditions are very common worldwide, especially prominent in the older population and expected to further increase in prevalence.

LUTS suggestive of BPH only concerns male patients, mostly older, and includes a number of symptoms such as frequency, nocturia, urgency, weak stream or interruption during micturition, high post-void residual volume in the urinary bladder or the difficulty initiating micturition. Recent estimates indicate that almost 50% of men aged 50 years or older suffer from LUTS as a consequence of BPH and 80% of males over the age of 80 years. In the US, prevalence numbers have developed substantially over the past years and it is expected that this trend will continue as the population ages.

A similar picture can be drawn for hypertension. According to Chow et al. global prevalence figures for hypertension in adults are around 30% to 45% with this number being similar across the world and independent of the country's income status. Age, however, does play an important role in the prevalence of hypertension as rates increase with progressing age. This results in shares of more than 60% in people with 60 years or more and about 75% in people over the age of 75 years. It is currently forecasted that the number of people with hypertension will rise by 15% to 20% until 2025 resulting in approximately 1.5 billion affected people worldwide.

The use of alpha-1 antagonists in the therapy of hypertension is based on the modulation of vessel tone and systemic vascular resistance, which results in an increase in venous capacitance and lowering of blood pressure. As alpha-1 adrenergic antagonists cause a relaxation of smooth muscle both in the vascular system and in the prostate, they are also effective in the therapy of LUTS suggestive of BPH reducing the symptoms by up to 50%. Long-term studies showed no reduction in prostate size nor prevention of acute urinary retention events, though. The most common adverse side effects include dizziness, postural hypotension, asthenia, headache, rhinitis and ejaculatory dysfunction occurring in about 5% to 9% of the patients.

### Safety and efficacy of an α-blocker plus mirabegron compared with an α-blocker plus antimuscarinic in men with lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia and overactive bladder: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^17e7d696]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

Antimuscarinics and the β3-adrenoreceptor agonist, mirabegron, are commonly used for treating patients with overactive bladder (OAB) and α 1 -adrenoreceptor antagonists (α 1 -blockers) are the main pharmacological agents used for treating lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). As these conditions commonly occur together, the aim of this systematic review was to identify publications that compared the use of an α 1 -blocker plus mirabegron with an α 1 -blocker plus antimuscarinic in men with LUTS secondary to BPH and OAB. A meta-analysis was subsequently conducted to explore the safety and efficacy of these combinations.

Methods

Included records had to be from a parallel-group, randomized clinical trial that was ≥ 8 weeks in duration. Participants were male with LUTS secondary to BPH and OAB. The indirect analyses that were identified compared an α 1 -blocker plus OAB agent with an α 1 -blocker plus placebo. The PubMed/Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, the Excerpta Medica Database, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the ClinicalTrials.gov registry were searched for relevant records up until March 5, 2020. Safety outcomes included incidences of overall treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and urinary retention, postvoid residual volume, and maximum urinary flow (Q max). Primary efficacy outcomes were micturitions/day, incontinence episodes/day, and urgency episodes/day, and secondary outcomes were Overactive Bladder Symptom Score and International Prostate Symptom Score. A Bayesian network meta-analysis approach was used for the meta-analysis.

Results

Out of a total of 1039 records identified, 24 were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. There were no statistically significant differences between the α 1 -blocker plus mirabegron and α 1 -blocker plus antimuscarinic groups in terms of the comparisons identified for all the safety and efficacy analyses conducted. Numerically superior results were frequently observed for the α 1 -blocker plus mirabegron group compared with the α 1 -blocker plus antimuscarinic group for the safety parameters, including TEAEs, urinary retention, and Q max. For some of the efficacy parameters, most notably micturitions/day, numerically superior results were noted for the α 1 -blocker plus antimuscarinic group. Inconsistency in reporting and study variability were noted in the included records, which hindered data interpretation.

Conclusion

This systematic review and meta-analysis showed that an α 1 -blocker plus mirabegron and an α 1 -blocker plus antimuscarinic have similar safety and efficacy profiles in male patients with LUTS secondary to BPH and OAB. Patients may, therefore, benefit from the use of either combination within the clinical setting.
