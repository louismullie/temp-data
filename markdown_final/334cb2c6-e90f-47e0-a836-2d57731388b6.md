## Question

What is the best initial test to determine if a patient has a pulmonary embolism?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which initial test is best to determine if a patient has a pulmonary embolism (PE). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about establishing pretest probability with a validated clinical decision rule. Then, I should verify when a high-sensitivity D-dimer is the best initial test versus when to proceed directly to imaging. Next, I will review assay selection and age-adjusted thresholds. After that, I should consider special populations and alternative algorithms such as PERC and YEARS. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, scenario-based conclusion that aligns with guideline-supported standards of care.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: no single test is universally "best" as the initial step for all patients; the diagnostic pathway must be anchored to pretest probability estimation using a validated tool like the Wells or Geneva scores, because safety and efficiency depend on coupling clinical probability with appropriate testing, particularly D-dimer in low-risk patients [^115bZcvh] [^112wD9UV] [^1142RkTj].

> I need to check how to stratify patients practically. Using the dichotomized Wells rule, a score ≤ 4 defines "PE unlikely", and a score > 4 defines "PE likely"; this dichotomy has been widely adopted and is supported by robust outcome data showing that "PE unlikely" combined with a normal D-dimer safely excludes PE with very low 3‑month venous thromboembolism rates, enabling imaging to be avoided when the D-dimer is negative [^115bZcvh] [^112wD9UV] [^1142RkTj].

> For patients categorized as "PE unlikely", I should verify the best initial test: a highly sensitive, quantitative D-dimer assay is preferred because its very high sensitivity and low negative likelihood ratio yield a high negative predictive value when pretest probability is low, supporting safe exclusion of PE without imaging when the result is negative [^114NcPTj] [^111YD3Bi] [^112wD9UV].

> Hold on, I should confirm assay selection details. Quantitative high-sensitivity assays (ELISA, ELFA, or quantitative latex/immunoturbidimetric) consistently outperform qualitative point-of-care D-dimer tests for ruling out PE, and guideline summaries emphasize knowing the specific assay's characteristics; using age-adjusted thresholds in patients 50 years or older (age × 10 μg/L FEU) improves specificity while maintaining safety when combined with an "unlikely" Wells rule [^115P1Co8] [^115RZgK9] [^11452w79] [^1142RkTj].

> Let me think about result-driven next steps to avoid misapplication. If the highly sensitive D-dimer is negative in a "PE unlikely" patient, PE is excluded and anticoagulation can be withheld without further imaging; if positive, the pathway proceeds to imaging, typically CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA), a strategy that has a very low failure rate and reduces unnecessary imaging overall [^112wD9UV] [^112rULpX].

> For patients with "PE likely" (high pretest probability), I should confirm that the initial test is imaging, not D-dimer. CTPA is the appropriate first-line diagnostic test when clinical probability is high; using D-dimer in this context is discouraged because the post-test probability remains too high even with a negative result to safely exclude PE, according to guideline syntheses and pragmatic emergency literature [^112rULpX] [^1132f2Qg].

> Hmm, wait a minute — earlier I thought a negative highly sensitive D-dimer in high pretest probability patients could have an NPV as low as 82–96%, potentially missing up to 18% of PEs, which would argue strongly against its use to exclude PE in this group [^112yKvLd] [^114UCWnd]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions, I should double-check those data: ancillary analyses actually reported zero observed failures among high-risk patients with negative age-adjusted or fixed 500 ng/mL D-dimer, but with wide confidence intervals and meaningful design limitations, so they cannot overturn the long-standing caution against using D-dimer alone in high-probability patients; hence, direct imaging remains the standard in high pretest probability despite these exploratory findings [^113ycCZu] [^116575yR] [^112rULpX].

> I need to ensure I cover alternatives when CTPA is unsuitable. If iodinated contrast is contraindicated or renal function is severely impaired, ventilation–perfusion scanning and/or lower-extremity compression ultrasonography are reasonable alternatives; a negative D-dimer may occasionally support deferral in atypical cases, but this is not standard in high-probability presentations, where imaging confirmation is still required for safe decision-making [^112rULpX].

> Next, I should review streamlined rules that further reduce testing in very low-risk patients. In PERC-negative patients with very low clinical suspicion, D-dimer may be omitted; and the YEARS algorithm with adjusted D-dimer thresholds reduces imaging while maintaining safety, including in the cluster-randomized trial that combined YEARS with PERC and age-adjusted D-dimer to minimize unnecessary CTPA without increasing 3‑month VTE events [^117HdvTK].

> But wait, what if the patient is older, pregnant, or has concurrent COVID-19 where D-dimer specificity is problematic? For patients 50 years or older, I should use the age-adjusted D-dimer to safely increase specificity; in pregnancy, the pregnancy-adapted YEARS algorithm allows many to avoid imaging safely; in COVID-19, sensitivity remains high but specificity is very low, so I should interpret positive results cautiously and rely on clinical probability to guide imaging decisions [^11452w79] [^115nHpBc] [^112XguGC].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line and ensure it aligns with outcome and guideline data. The best initial test is not a single assay but a strategy: first, apply a validated clinical decision rule (e.g. Wells) to determine whether PE is "unlikely" or "likely"; then, if "unlikely", the best initial test is a highly sensitive, quantitative D-dimer using an age-adjusted cutoff in patients 50 years or older, with negative results excluding PE without imaging, whereas if "likely", proceed directly to CTPA as the initial diagnostic test; specialized algorithms (YEARS, pregnancy-adapted YEARS) and age-adjusted D-dimer can further optimize safety and reduce unnecessary imaging in appropriate populations [^1142RkTj] [^112wD9UV] [^112rULpX] [^11452w79] [^115nHpBc].

The best initial test to determine if a patient has a pulmonary embolism is to **assess clinical probability using a validated tool (Wells or Geneva)** [^1142RkTj], then **perform a high-sensitivity D-dimer test if probability is low or intermediate** [^11452w79]. A negative D-dimer in this context **safely excludes PE** without imaging [^114NcPTj] [^112wD9UV]. If clinical probability is high, proceed directly to imaging (CTPA) [^112rULpX] without D-dimer testing [^1132f2Qg].

---

## Clinical probability assessment

Clinical probability assessment is the **essential first step** in evaluating suspected PE. Validated clinical prediction rules — such as the Wells or Geneva scores [^115bZcvh] — stratify patients into low, intermediate, or high probability categories based on clinical features and risk factors [^1142RkTj]. This stratification guides subsequent diagnostic testing and management [^112rULpX].

---

## D-dimer testing

D-dimer is a fibrin degradation product [^113CguKd] elevated in thrombotic conditions, including PE. High-sensitivity D-dimer assays have high sensitivity and negative predictive value [^114NcPTj], making them **useful for excluding PE** in low- and intermediate-risk patients [^112wD9UV]. Among patients with **low or intermediate probability**, a negative D-dimer test (< 500 ng/mL or age-adjusted threshold) [^11452w79] [^117HdvTK] safely excludes PE [^1142RkTj] without further imaging. In those with **high probability**, D-dimer testing is not recommended [^112rULpX] due to a high false-negative rate; proceed directly to imaging [^1132f2Qg].

---

## Imaging studies

Imaging is **required** when clinical probability is high or when D-dimer is positive in low- or intermediate-risk patients [^112rULpX]. Options include **Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA)**, the gold standard for PE diagnosis with high sensitivity and specificity, and **Ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan**, an alternative when CTPA is contraindicated (e.g. contrast allergy, pregnancy) [^115nHpBc].

---

## Summary of diagnostic approach

| **Clinical probability** | **Initial test** | **Next step if positive** |
|-|-|-|
| Low or intermediate | High-sensitivity D-dimer [^114NcPTj] | CTPA or V/Q scan [^112rULpX] |
| High | CTPA or V/Q scan [^112rULpX] | Immediate imaging [^1132f2Qg] |

---

The best initial test for suspected PE is **clinical probability assessment followed by D-dimer testing** in low- or intermediate-risk patients [^117HdvTK]. This approach efficiently excludes PE without unnecessary imaging and guides management [^112wD9UV].

### Outcomes of high pretest probability patients undergoing D-dimer testing for pulmonary embolism: A pilot study [^1132f2Qg]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) D-dimer testing is commonly used in the evaluation of possible pulmonary embolism (PE) in the emergency department but is not recommended in high pretest probability patients. The question of whether a negative ELISA D-dimer can safely rule out PE in these patients remains unanswered, as no large studies have compared ELISA D-dimer results and outcomes in patients with high pretest probability. This research involved a prospective observational pilot study of emergency department patients evaluated for PE.

Patients evaluated for PE were assessed for pretest probability using the Wells PE Score. High pretest probability was defined as a dichotomized Wells Score greater than 4 points and a trichotomized Wells Score greater than 6 points. In these cases, the treating physician ordered an ELISA D-dimer test. Pulmonary embolism was confirmed by a positive computed tomography scan, a high probability ventilation/perfusion scan, a positive pulmonary angiogram, or PE on 3-month follow-up.

- **Study results**: We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and likelihood ratios for the ELISA D-dimer. We prospectively enrolled 541 patients who underwent D-dimer testing for PE; of these, 130 patients had a Wells Score greater than 4, and 33 patients had a Wells Score greater than 6 (not mutually exclusive).

Of the subjects with a Wells Score greater than 4, 23 (18%) were diagnosed with PE, and 40 (31%) had a negative D-dimer. No patient with a Wells Score greater than 4 (sensitivity 100%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 82%-100%; specificity 37%, 95% CI 28%-47%) or a Wells Score greater than 6 (sensitivity 100%, 95% CI 63%-100%; specificity 56%, 95% CI 35%-76%) who had a negative result was found.

### The original and simplified Wells rules and age-adjusted D-dimer testing to rule out pulmonary embolism: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^1142RkTj]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). High credibility.

Essentials evidence for the simplified Wells rule in ruling out acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is scarce. This was a post-hoc analysis on data from 6 studies comprising 7,268 patients with suspected PE. The simplified Wells rule combined with age-adjusted D-dimer testing may safely rule out PE. Given its ease of use, the simplified Wells rule is to be preferred over the original Wells rule.

- **Background**: The Wells score and D-dimer testing can safely rule out pulmonary embolism (PE). A simplification of the Wells score has been proposed to improve clinical applicability, but evidence on its performance is scarce.

- **Objectives**: To compare the performances of the original and simplified Wells scores alone and in combination with age-adjusted D-dimer testing.

- **Methods**: Individual patient data from 7,268 patients with suspected PE enrolled in six management studies were used to evaluate the discriminatory performances of the original and simplified Wells scores. The efficiency and failure rate of the dichotomized original and simplified scores combined with age-adjusted D-dimer testing were compared by use of a one-stage random effects meta-analysis. Efficiency was defined as the proportion of patients in whom PE could be considered to be excluded on the basis of a "PE unlikely" Wells score and a negative age-adjusted D-dimer test result. Failure rate was defined as the proportion of patients with symptomatic venous thromboembolism during a 3-month follow-up.

- **Results**: The discriminatory performances of the original and simplified Wells scores were comparable (c-statistic 0.73 [95.

### Safety of excluding acute pulmonary embolism based on an unlikely clinical probability by the Wells rule and normal D-dimer concentration: A meta-analysis [^112wD9UV]. Thrombosis Research (2010). Low credibility.

The Wells clinical decision rule (CDR) and D-dimer tests can be used to exclude pulmonary embolism (PE). We performed a meta-analysis to determine the negative predictive value (NPV) of an "unlikely" CDR (≤ 4 points) combined with a normal D-dimer test and the safety of withholding anticoagulants based on these criteria.

- **Methods**: Prospective studies that withheld anticoagulant treatment from patients with clinically suspected PE and an "unlikely" CDR in combination with a normal D-dimer concentration without performing further tests were searched for in Medline, Cochrane, and Embase. The primary endpoints were the recurrence rate of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and PE-related mortality during 3-month follow-up.

- **Results**: Four studies including 1660 consecutive patients were identified. The pooled incidence of VTE after initial exclusion of acute PE based on an "unlikely" CDR and normal D-dimer was 0.34% (95% CI 0.036–0.96%), resulting in a NPV of 99.7% (95% CI: 99.0–99.9%, random effects model). The risk for PE-related mortality was very low: 1/1660 patients had fatal PE (0.06%, 95% CI 0.0017–0.46%).

- **Conclusion**: Acute PE can be safely excluded in patients with clinically suspected acute PE who have an "unlikely" probability and a negative D-dimer test, and anticoagulant treatment can be withheld. There is no need for additional radiological tests in these patients to rule out PE.

### Diagnostic accuracy of D-dimer test for exclusion of venous thromboembolism: A systematic review [^115P1Co8]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2007). Low credibility.

The reported diagnostic accuracy of the D-dimer test for exclusion of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) varies. It is unknown to what extent this is due to differences in study design or patient groups or to genuine differences between D-dimer assays.

- **Methods**: Studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of the D-dimer test in the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism were systematically searched for in the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases up to March 2005. Reference lists of all included studies and reviews related to the topic of the present meta-analysis were manually searched for other additional potentially eligible studies. Two reviewers independently extracted study characteristics using standardized forms.

- **Results**: In total, 217 D-dimer test evaluations for DVT and 111 for PE were analyzed. Several study design characteristics were associated with systematic differences in diagnostic accuracy. After adjustment for these features, the sensitivities of the D-dimer enzyme-linked immunofluorescence assay (ELFA) (DVT 96%; PE 97%), microplate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (DVT 94%; PE 95%), and latex quantitative assay (DVT 93%; PE 95%) were superior to those of the whole-blood D-dimer assay (DVT 83%; PE 87%), latex semiquantitative assay (DVT 85%; PE 88%), and latex qualitative assay (DVT 69%; PE 75%). The latex qualitative and whole-blood D-dimer assays had the highest specificities (DVT 99%, 71%; PE 99%, 69%).

- **Conclusions**: Compared to other D-dimer assays, the ELFA, microplate ELISA, and latex quantitative assays have higher sensitivities.

### Excluding venous thromboembolism using point of care D-dimer tests in outpatients: a diagnostic meta-analysis [^1174474d]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to review the evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of the currently available point of care D-dimer tests for excluding venous thromboembolism.

- **Design**: Systematic review of research was conducted on the accuracy of point of care D-dimer tests, utilizing bivariate regression to examine sources of variation and estimate sensitivity and specificity.

- **Data sources**: The analysis included studies on the diagnostic accuracy of point of care D-dimer tests published between January 1995 and September 2008, available in both Medline and Embase.

- **Review methods**: The studies incorporated into the analysis compared point of care D-dimer tests with predefined reference criteria for venous thromboembolism, enrolled consecutive outpatients, and permitted the construction of a 2×2 table.

Results included 23 studies with a total of 13,959 patients, where the mean age ranged from 38 to 65 years, and the prevalence of venous thromboembolism ranged from 4% to 51%. The studies reported on two qualitative point of care D-dimer tests (SimpliRED D-dimer with 12 studies and Clearview Simplify D-dimer with 7 studies) and two quantitative point of care D-dimer tests (Cardiac D-dimer with 4 studies and Triage D-dimer with 2 studies). Overall sensitivity ranged from 0.85 (95% confidence interval 0.78 to 0.90) to 0.96 (0.91 to 0.98) and overall specificity ranged from 0.48 (0.33 to 0.62) to 0.74 (0.69 to 0.78). Notably, the two quantitative tests, Cardiac D-dimer and Triage D-dimer, scored most favorably.

In conclusion, for outpatients suspected of venous thromboembolism, point of care D-dimer tests can provide significant information and guide patient management, especially in low-risk patients.

### Selective D-dimer testing for diagnosis of a first suspected episode of deep venous thrombosis: a randomized trial [^116NJWJD]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). High credibility.

D-dimer testing is sensitive but not specific for diagnosing deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Changing the use of testing and the threshold level for a positive test result based on the risk for DVT might improve the tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity and reduce the need for testing.

- **Objective**: To determine whether using a selective D-dimer testing strategy based on clinical pretest probability (C-PTP) for DVT is safe and reduces diagnostic testing compared with using a single D-dimer threshold for all patients.

- **Design**: Randomized, multicenter, controlled trial. Patients were allocated using a central automated system. Ultrasonographers and study adjudicators, but not other study personnel, were blinded to trial allocation. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00157677).

- **Setting**: Five Canadian hospitals.

- **Patients**: Consecutive symptomatic patients with a first episode of suspected DVT.

- **Intervention**: Selective testing (n = 860) was defined as D-dimer testing for outpatients with low or moderate C-PTP (DVT excluded at D-dimer levels < 1.0 µg/mL [low C-PTP] or < 0.5 µg/mL [moderate C-PTP]) and venous ultrasonography without D-dimer testing for outpatients with high C-PTP and inpatients. Uniform testing (n = 863) was defined as D-dimer testing for all participants (DVT excluded at D-dimer levels < 0.5 µg/mL).

- **Measurements**: The proportion of patients not diagnosed with DVT during initial testing who had symptomatic venous thromboembolism during a 3-month follow-up and the proportion of patients undergoing D-dimer testing and ultrasonography.

### Excluding venous thromboembolism using point of care D-dimer tests in outpatients: a diagnostic meta-analysis [^116SZDpS]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

This is the first meta-analysis of studies on the currently available point of care D-dimer tests. Measuring D-dimer levels is an important step in the diagnostic investigation of patients suspected of having venous thromboembolism. A negative D-dimer test result, in combination with a low pre-test probability of venous thromboembolism, is widely used to exclude the diagnosis, thus safely reducing the number of unnecessary referrals for imaging. A meta-analysis performed by Fancher et al. in 2004 concluded that a negative result on SimpliRED D-dimer could exclude venous thromboembolism in low-risk patients; however, after 2004, various newer point of care D-dimer tests (qualitative as well as quantitative) have become available. We summarized the literature on the diagnostic accuracy of these point of care assays, including the older SimpliRED D-dimer.

Our meta-analysis shows that the qualitative assays, such as SimpliRED D-dimer and Clearview Simplify D-dimer, have a lower sensitivity (i.e. a higher number of false negatives) but higher specificity (i.e. a lower number of false positives) than the quantitative assays, such as Cardiac D-dimer and Triage D-dimer. The latter seem, therefore, better suited to rule out deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in suspected patients as they decrease the pre-test probability of venous thromboembolism more effectively. In this regard, Cardiac D-dimer outperforms Triage D-dimer, as it is able to rule out DVT both in patients with a low pre-test risk and in those with a moderate pre-test risk.

### Effect of a diagnostic strategy using an elevated and age-adjusted D-dimer threshold on thromboembolic events in emergency department patients with suspected pulmonary embolism: A randomized clinical trial [^117HdvTK]. JAMA (2021). High credibility.

Uncontrolled studies suggest that pulmonary embolism (PE) can be safely ruled out using the YEARS rule, a diagnostic strategy that uses varying D-dimer thresholds.

- **Objective**: To prospectively validate the safety of a strategy that combines the YEARS rule with the pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria (PERC) rule and an age-adjusted D-dimer threshold.

- **Design, settings, and participants**: This was a cluster-randomized, crossover, noninferiority trial conducted in 18 emergency departments in France and Spain. Patients (N = 1414) who had a low clinical risk of PE not excluded by the PERC rule or a subjective clinical intermediate risk of PE were included from October 2019 to June 2020 and followed up until October 2020.

- **Interventions**: Each center was randomized for the sequence of intervention periods. During the intervention period (726 patients), PE was excluded without chest imaging in patients with no YEARS criteria and a D-dimer level less than 1000 ng/mL, and in patients with 1 or more YEARS criteria and a D-dimer level less than the age-adjusted threshold (500 ng/mL if age < 50 years or age in years × 10 in patients ≥ 50 years). In the control period (688 patients), PE was excluded without chest imaging when the D-dimer level was less than the age-adjusted threshold.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary endpoint was venous thromboembolism (VTE) at 3 months. The noninferiority margin was set at 1.35%. There were 8 secondary endpoints, including chest imaging, ED length of stay, hospital admission, nonindicated anticoagulation treatment, all-cause death, and all-cause readmission.

### The D-dimer assay [^113CguKd]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Low credibility.

D-dimer is an indirect marker of fibrinolysis and fibrin turnover; this molecule exhibits unique properties as a biological marker of hemostatic abnormalities and as an indicator of intravascular thrombosis. D-dimer is a soluble fibrin degradation product that results from the systematic degradation of vascular thrombi through the fibrinolytic mechanism. Because of this, the D-dimer serves as a valuable marker of activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis in a number of clinical scenarios. Most commonly, D-dimer has been extensively investigated for excluding the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and is used routinely for this indication. In addition, D-dimer has been evaluated for determining the optimal duration of anticoagulation in VTE patients, for diagnosing and monitoring disseminated intravascular coagulation, and for monitoring other conditions in which the patient is at high risk of bleeding or thrombosis. Limitations of the assay include D-dimer elevation in a constellation of clinical scenarios (age, pregnancy, and cancer) and lack of clinical standardization.

### Excluding venous thromboembolism using point of care D-dimer tests in outpatients: a diagnostic meta-analysis [^112yKvLd]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

Table 3 shows the extent to which different point-of-care D-dimer assays changed the post-test probability of venous thromboembolism — that is, the incidence of venous thromboembolism following normal results from a point-of-care D-dimer test — for various clinically relevant pre-test probabilities. For example, if the prevalence of venous thromboembolism is high (50%) in a suspected population, a negative Clearview Simplify D-dimer test yields a post-test probability of 18%. However, if the prevalence of venous thromboembolism in the population is low (5%), a negative Clearview Simplify D-dimer test reduces this prevalence to a post-test probability of 1.1%. Figure 4 can be used to estimate post-test probabilities for other pre-test probabilities.

- **Fagan's nomogram**: Figure 4 shows Fagan's nomogram for Cardiac D-dimer (dashed red line) and Clearview Simplify D-dimer (solid blue line), with a fixed post-test probability of 2%. If the post-test probability is fixed at the accepted safety standard of 2%, the Cardiac D-dimer can exclude venous thromboembolism in patients with a pre-test probability of up to 27%, compared with 9% with the Clearview Simplify D-dimer. For other pre-test probabilities, the post-test probability can be calculated by simply drawing a line through the negative likelihood ratio of the respective point-of-care D-dimer test (see Table 3) and the chosen pre-test probability.

- **Table 3 summary**: Analysis of the negative predictive value of point-of-care D-dimer tests for patients at low, moderate, and high risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Low risk = 5%, moderate risk = 20%, and high risk = 50%.

### D-dimer to rule out venous thromboembolism during pregnancy: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115or3pN]. Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis (2021). High credibility.

This systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and the Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies (PRISMA-DTA) guidelines.

- **Criteria for study selection**: Prospective and retrospective studies that used plasma D-dimer measurement to rule out VTE in pregnant women with suspected PE and/or DVT were considered. We included studies using D-dimer (index test), combined or not with PTP assessment, in which an imaging test (V/Q lung scan, CTPA, pulmonary angiography, lower limb venous CUS) or clinical follow-up at 3 months were used as the reference standard. Studies were eligible if a 2 × 2 contingency table was supplied or could be back-calculated (true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives), or if the sensitivity and NPV of D-dimer could be calculated.

- **Population**: The study's population consisted of adult (≥ 18 years) pregnant women during their first, second, or third trimester of pregnancy presenting to an outpatient clinic or emergency department with symptoms and/or signs suggestive of acute PE and/or DVT, namely acute or new-onset dyspnea and/or chest pain or lower limb pain and/or edema without an obvious explanation. The present analysis targets a population of pregnant women estimated with a disease prevalence consistent with a low/intermediate or unlikely PTP according to a CDR (prespecified PTP) or irrespective of PTP when a CDR had not been applied (PTP not used) in the original study.

### The clinical significance of ultra-high D-dimer levels [^115BXMBZ]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2022). High credibility.

Plasma D-dimer levels > 5000 ng/mL are encountered in a number of conditions other than venous thromboembolism (VTE). Recent studies have used plasma D-dimer levels as a prognostic indicator for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. The implications of abnormal levels are less clear for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with a baseline elevation in plasma D-dimer levels. In the present study, we reviewed the occurrence of plasma D-dimer levels > 5000 ng/mL and investigated the clinical significance of this finding before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

- **Methods**: Inpatient records for a 4-year period were screened for laboratory results of plasma D-dimer levels > 5000 ng/mL. The patient data were reviewed for the clinical identifiers commonly associated with elevated plasma D-dimer levels, including VTE, cancer, sepsis, pneumonia, other infections, bleeding, and trauma. The patients were then categorized into groups stratified by the plasma D-dimer level to allow for comparisons between the various clinical diagnoses.

- **Results**: A total of 671 patients were included in the present study. VTE was the most common diagnosis for patients with a plasma D-dimer level > 5000 ng/mL, followed by cancer and pneumonia. Multiple clinical diagnoses were present in 61% of the patients. No clear cause for the ultra-high plasma D-dimer level could be identified in 11.3% of the patients. Among the patients lacking a clinical diagnosis at discharge, mortality was 24% in the 5000- to 10,000-ng/mL group, 28.6% in the 10,000- to 15,000-ng/mL group, and 75% in the > 15,000-ng/mL group.

### D-dimer to rule out venous thromboembolism during pregnancy: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111BAkcE]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

Study characteristics:

Characteristics of included studies and baseline characteristics of patients enrolled in the studies are summarized in the text. Study size ranged from 149 to 498 patients. The total overall population of the four studies was 1,194 patients, of whom 836 were eligible for the present analysis. Of the four studies included, three were prospective, and only one had a retrospective design. Only one study was specifically designed for suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT), whereas the other three focused on suspected pulmonary embolism (PE).

Regarding the D-dimer test, highly sensitive quantitative assays - ELISA and immuno-turbidimetric assays, expressing results as fibrinogen equivalent units - were used in three studies. Of these, two used the same commercial assay for all their patients, whereas one allowed different types of commercially available assays. The prespecified D-dimer cutoff used was the standard cutoff of 500 ng/mL in two studies: for all patients in one and for low-intermediate pretest probability (PTP) patients in the other. One study used a higher prespecified cutoff (< 1000 ng/mL) in patients with low PTP and the standard 500 μg/L cutoff in other patients, based on a defined diagnostic algorithm. Only one study utilized a red blood cell agglutination assay (qualitative assay), known to have a lower sensitivity (the SimpliRED test).

### Safe exclusion of pulmonary embolism using the Wells rule and qualitative D-dimer testing in primary care: Prospective cohort study [^115KwZS8]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Combining the Wells rule with point of care D-dimer testing, results for the point of care D-dimer test were not interpretable in 39 patients (6.5% of all patients). According to the study protocol, these tests were evaluated as positive test results in all analyses.

If a threshold Wells score of ≤ 4 was combined with a negative D-dimer test result, then 4 out of 272 patients in this low-risk category would be diagnosed as having pulmonary embolism, resulting in a failure rate of 1.5% (95% confidence interval 0.4% to 3.7%). The efficiency of this strategy was 45.5% (272/598). The sensitivity and specificity of a score of ≤ 4 combined with a negative D-dimer test result were 94.5% (86.6% to 98.5%) and 51.0% (46.7% to 55.4%), respectively.

In 168 patients with a Wells score of < 2, the D-dimer test result was also negative. In these very low-risk patients, two cases of pulmonary embolism were observed, yielding a failure rate of 1.2% (0.1% to 4.2%) and an efficiency of 28.1% (168/598). The sensitivity and specificity of this strategy were 97.3% (90.5% to 99.7%) and 31.6% (27.7% to 35.8%), respectively.

### Advocating prudent D-dimer testing: Constructive perspectives and comments on 'How we manage a high D-dimer' [^111rctNM]. Haematologica (2024). Low credibility.

We read with great interest the narrative review, "How we manage a high D-dimer", authored by Massimo Franchini and colleagues and published in a recent issue of Haematologica. This review offers didactic and informative content, and although we generally agree with the perspectives and recommendations presented, we would like to address two specific issues that are vital to good clinical practice: the correct understanding of the properties of diagnostic tests and the need for reduction of unnecessary test prescription.

- **Diagnostic tests**: Regarding the first issue, the review mentions the intrinsically low positive predictive value (PPV) of D-dimer testing. It is essential to clarify that PPV is not an intrinsic characteristic of the test. Rather, PPV is determined by the interaction between the pre-test probability and the test's positive likelihood ratio. Therefore, even a test like D-dimer, which has a low positive likelihood ratio, can exhibit a high PPV if applied in a setting with a very high pre-test probability.

- **Test prescriptions**: Regarding the second issue, the review highlights that ubiquitous physiological conditions such as aging, pregnancy, and physical activity are among the main causes of elevated D-dimer levels. It also states that D-dimer testing has limited clinical utility in the random asymptomatic ambulatory patient and appropriately suggests that it should only be prescribed in specific clinical situations. Yet, it also asserts that an elevated D-Dimer ordered in the random asymptomatic ambulatory patient cannot be ignored and warrants further consideration. The review proposes an algorithm for managing such cases.

### D-dimer testing to determine the duration of anticoagulation therapy [^112EBy6G]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). High credibility.

The optimal duration of oral anticoagulation in patients with idiopathic venous thromboembolism is uncertain. Testing of D-dimer levels may play a role in assessing the need for prolonged anticoagulation.

- **Methods**: We performed D-dimer testing one month after the discontinuation of anticoagulation in patients with a first unprovoked proximal deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism who had received a vitamin K antagonist for at least three months. Patients with a normal D-dimer level did not resume anticoagulation, whereas those with an abnormal D-dimer level were randomly assigned either to resume or to discontinue treatment. The study outcome was the composite of recurrent venous thromboembolism and major bleeding during an average follow-up of 1.4 years.

- **Results**: The D-dimer assay was abnormal in 223 of 608 patients (36.7%). A total of 18 events occurred among the 120 patients who stopped anticoagulation (15.0%), as compared with 3 events among the 103 patients who resumed anticoagulation (2.9%), for an adjusted hazard ratio of 4.26 (95% confidence interval, 1.23 to 14.6; P = 0.02). Thromboembolism recurred in 24 of 385 patients with a normal D-dimer level (6.2%). Among patients who stopped anticoagulation, the adjusted hazard ratio for recurrent thromboembolism among those with an abnormal D-dimer level, as compared with those with a normal D-dimer level, was 2.27 (95% CI, 1.15 to 4.46; P = 0.02).

- **Conclusions**: Patients with an abnormal D-dimer level one month after the discontinuation of anticoagulation have a significant incidence of recurrent venous thromboembolism.

### Serum D-dimer is a sensitive test for the detection of acute aortic dissection: a pooled meta-analysis [^111sFxEb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Acute aortic dissection is a rare but devastating condition with high mortality. Unfortunately, there is no sensitive screening indicator of disease in common use. The objective of this study was to assess the sensitivity and utility of the serum D-dimer as a test for acute aortic dissection. A pooled analysis was performed on all original research studies testing the sensitivity of serum D-dimer for acute aortic dissection.

A search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Register using the terms "aortic dissection" and "D-dimer" was made of all English language publications. All original reports of consecutively enrolled patients with acute aortic dissection and a measured serum D-dimer were included, while case reports were excluded. A value of 0.5 microgram per milliliter was defined as the threshold for a positive D-dimer. The primary outcome was the pooled sensitivity of the D-dimer test for acute aortic dissection.

There were 21 original reports of patients with acute aortic dissection and D-dimer measurements. Eleven studies were included, describing a total of 349 acute aortic dissection patients. The sensitivity of the D-dimer test was 327/349, 94% (95% confidence interval: 91–96), and the point estimate was essentially unchanged in a sensitivity analysis, 183/192, 95% (95% confidence interval: 91–98). Specificity ranged from 40% to 100%. Serum D-dimer is sensitive for acute aortic dissection and potentially represents a useful test for patients who present with a low likelihood of this disease.

### Effect of two different FDA-approved D-dimer assays on resource utilization in the emergency department [^115uhsik]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The D-dimer assay is an appropriate test to rule out pulmonary embolism (PE) in low-risk patients in the emergency department (ED). Multiple assays are approved to measure D-dimer levels, and studies have shown that a newer assay, Tina-quant, has similar diagnostic accuracy to the VIDAS assay.

- **Objectives**: The objective was to determine the effects of transitioning from the VIDAS assay to the Tina-quant D-dimer assay on the need for computed tomography angiogram (CTA) and ED length of stay (LOS) in patients being evaluated for PE in the ED.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study was conducted of patients who had D-dimer levels ordered at an urban, academic, Level I trauma center with over 55,000 annual ED visits. D-dimer levels in the ED were recorded over a period of 6 months prior to and 6 months after the transition to the new D-dimer assay. The numbers of positive and negative D-dimers and the need for subsequent CTAs were recorded for comparison. LOS was also recorded to determine time saved. Medians were calculated and compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.

- **Results**: During the initial period, 875 D-dimers were ordered, with a positive rate of 41.5%. After the introduction of the Tina-quant assay, 859 tests were ordered, with 25.5% yielding positive results. An absolute decrease of 16% in the number of necessary CTAs was observed after the transition to the Tina-quant assay (p < 0.003). LOS data showed a mean LOS of 481 minutes in the ED for patients tested with the Tina-quant assay compared to 526 minutes with the previous assay.

### D-dimer for the exclusion of acute venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism: A systematic review [^114NcPTj]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Despite extensive literature, the diagnostic role of d-dimer for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) remains unclear, reflecting multiple d-dimer assays and concerns about differing sensitivities and variability.

- **Purpose**: To systematically review trials that assessed sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, and variability among d-dimer assays.

- **Data sources**: Studies in all languages were identified by searching PubMed from 1983 to January 2003 and EMBASE from 1988 to January 2003.

- **Study selection**: The researchers selected prospective studies that compared d-dimer with a reference standard. Studies of high methodological quality were included in the primary analyses; sensitivity analysis included additional weaker studies.

- **Data extraction**: Two authors collected data on study-level factors: d-dimer assay used, cutoff value, and whether patients had suspected DVT or PE.

- **Data synthesis**: For DVT, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and quantitative rapid ELISA dominate the rank order for these values: sensitivity, 0.96 (95% confidence limit [CL], 0.91 to 1.00), and negative likelihood ratio, 0.12 (CL, 0.04 to 0.33); and sensitivity, 0.96 (CL, 0.90 to 1.00), and negative likelihood ratio, 0.09 (CL, 0.02 to 0.41), respectively. For PE, the ELISA and quantitative rapid ELISA also dominate the rank order for these values: sensitivity, 0.95 (CL, 0.85 to 1.00), and negative likelihood ratio, 0.13 (CL, 0.03 to 0.58); and sensitivity, 0.95 (CL, 0.83 to 1.00), and negative likelihood ratio, 0.13 (CL, 0.02 to 0.84), respectively.

### Failure rate of D-dimer testing in patients with high clinical probability of pulmonary embolism: Ancillary analysis of three European studies [^113ycCZu]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

The failure rate of D-dimer testing was evaluated in patients with a high clinical probability of pulmonary embolism (PE). Seventy patients had D-dimer levels below the age-adjusted threshold, and none of them had a PE after follow-up, indicating a failure rate of 0.0% (95% CI 0.0%–6.5%). Bayesian analysis reported a credible interval of 0.0%–4.1%, with a 76.2% posterior probability of a failure rate below 2%.

Additionally, 48 patients had D-dimer levels below the fixed 500 ng/mL threshold, and none of them had a PE after follow-up, resulting in a failure rate of 0.0% (95% CI 0.0%–7.4%). Bayesian analysis reported a credible interval of 0.0%–5.9%, with a 62.8% posterior probability of a failure rate below 2%. The positive predictive value (PPV) observed with the age-adjusted D-dimer strategy is higher compared to the fixed 500 strategy. The difference in denominators — 581 for the age-adjusted strategy versus 603 for the fixed 500 strategy — reflects the total number of patients who tested positive under each approach. This difference suggests that the fixed 500 strategy produces more false positives. The age-adjusted D-dimer strategy, by yielding fewer false positives, consequently enhances its PPV compared to the fixed 500 strategy.

Among the 651 patients with a high clinical risk, including patients with negative and positive D-dimer values, no PE was missed at follow-up.

### Role of fibrin D-dimer testing in emergency medicine [^114Q7wUS]. Emergency medicine journal (2003). Low credibility.

Systemic values of the fibrinolytic plasma marker fibrin D-dimer are raised in a variety of acute clinical conditions. D-dimer values can now be rapidly determined and used to aid diagnosis in emergency medicine. However, despite clinical guidelines, inappropriate and unnecessary measurement of D-dimer values is a significant clinical problem. An understanding of the pathophysiological basis and limitations of the value of D-dimer values may help reduce this problem.

- **Objectives**: This review discusses the pathophysiology of the fibrinolytic system. The currently used assays, clinical indications, and limitations of D-dimer measurement are reviewed. Finally, the potential future clinical indications for measurement of D-dimer values in emergency medicine are discussed.

- **Methods**: Literature on D-dimer was identified from Medline, along with cross-referencing from the reference lists of major articles on the subject.

- **Results**: Systemic D-dimer values aid diagnosis and are potentially a prognostic indicator in a variety of clinical conditions in emergency medicine. However, D-dimer values have limited specificity in patients with comorbid conditions. Although, currently, there is no standard D-dimer assay, immunoturbidimetric assays are the most suitable for use in emergency medicine.

### Safety of using the combination of the Wells rule and D-dimer test for excluding acute recurrent ipsilateral deep vein thrombosis [^116eA5fT]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Low credibility.

The diagnostic accuracy of clinical probability assessment and D-dimer testing for clinically suspected recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of ruling out acute recurrent DVT based on an unlikely Wells score for DVT and a normal D-dimer test.

This was a predefined endpoint of the Theia study in which the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance direct thrombus imaging in acute recurrent ipsilateral DVT was validated. The Wells rule and D-dimer test, performed as part of the study protocol, were not used for management decisions. The primary outcome of this analysis was the incidence of recurrent DVT at baseline or during a 3-month follow-up for patients with an unlikely Wells score and a normal D-dimer test.

Results of both Wells score and D-dimer tests were available in 231 patients without anticoagulant treatment. The recurrent DVT prevalence was 45% (103/231). Forty-nine patients had an unlikely Wells score and a normal D-dimer test, of whom 3 (6.1%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3%-18%) had recurrent DVT at baseline/follow-up, yielding a sensitivity of 97% (95% CI 92%-99%) and specificity of 36% (95% CI 28%-45%). Thus, if clinical probability scoring and D-dimer testing had been applied, radiological imaging could have been omitted in 21% of patients with a diagnostic failure rate of 6.1%.

By applying clinical probability scoring and D-dimer testing, radiological imaging could be spared in one fifth of patients with suspected recurrent ipsilateral DVT.

### European Stroke Organization guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of cerebral venous thrombosis - endorsed by the European Academy of Neurology [^111vvojr]. European Journal of Neurology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for cerebral venous thrombosis, more specifically with respect to D-dimer testing, ESO 2017 guidelines recommend considering obtaining D-dimer before neuroimaging in patients with suspected CVT, except in patients with isolated headache or prolonged duration of symptoms (> 1 week) before the test.

### A new rapid bedside assay for quantitative testing of D-dimer (cardiac D-dimer) in the diagnostic work-up for deep vein thrombosis [^115T65zb]. Thrombosis Research (2003). Low credibility.

The accuracy of a new bedside, rapid, and quantitative D-dimer assay (Cardiac D-Dimer) was evaluated in outpatients with clinically suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The VIDAS test was used as the reference method. Eighty consecutive outpatients with suspected DVT of a lower limb were included in the study. Patients were classified as DVT positive or negative according to the results of objective tests (serial CUS), pretest clinical probability, and 3-month follow-up. DVT was diagnosed in 32 out of 80 patients (40%).

The performance of the two D-dimer assays was comparable, as indicated by the areas under the ROC curves (0.89 and 0.88, for Cardiac D-Dimer and VIDAS, respectively) and the coefficient of correlation (r = 0.91). The reproducibility of the test was acceptable, ranging from 6.2% to 12.0%. The sensitivity and negative predictive values were 100% for both tests. The specificity (SP) and positive predictive values (PPV) were similar (SP: 50.0% and 52.0%, PPV: 57.1% and 58.2%, for Cardiac D-Dimer and VIDAS, respectively).

The Cardiac D-Dimer test proved to be very accurate and produced results fully comparable to those obtained with the VIDAS test. Since the test can be directly performed in the emergency room within a few minutes, it seems to have great clinical potential. The place of this assay in the diagnostic strategy of DVT remains to be determined in prospective management studies.

### Emergency department D-dimer testing [^117FvG6L]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Since the early 1980s, much attention has been paid to the development of a biochemical marker for venous thromboembolism. D-dimers are derivatives of fibrinolysis and recently have been touted as a means of screening for thromboembolism. We review the physiologic, pathologic, and chemical bases for this new test, and outline the specific D-dimer assays currently available. We conclude with a discussion of the clinical utility of D-dimer in the evaluation of patients with venous thromboembolism.

### The impact of Covid-19 on the sensitivity of D-dimer for pulmonary embolism [^112XguGC]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

This study seeks to evaluate the test characteristics of D-dimer for pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with a concurrent diagnosis of Covid-19. We hypothesized that the sensitivity of D-dimer for PE at institutional cut points would be similar to those without Covid-19.

This is a multicenter retrospective observational cohort study conducted across five urban and suburban emergency departments (EDs) within the same healthcare system. The electronic health record was queried for all computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) studies from December 1, 2019, to October 22, 2020. All ED patients who underwent CTPA and had D-dimer and Covid-19 testing completed in a single encounter were included in the study. Baseline demographics were obtained, and the test characteristics of D-dimer for PE were calculated for patients with and without Covid-19. Additionally, receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curves were constructed for two different D-dimer assays.

There were 1,158 patient encounters that met criteria for analysis. The performance of D-dimer testing for PE was similar between Covid-19-positive and -negative patients. In Covid-19-positive patients, the sensitivity was 100% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 87.6%-100%), specificity was 11.9% (95% CI = 7.9%-17.1%), and negative predictive value (NPV) was 100%. In Covid-19-negative patients, the sensitivity was 97.6% (95% CI = 91.5%-99.7%), specificity was 14.4% (95% CI = 12.1%-17%), and NPV was 98.3% (95% CI = 93.8%-99.6%). For assay 1, the area under the curve (AUC) for Covid-19-positive patients was 0.76 (95% CI = 0.68–0.83).

### D-dimer as a potential biomarker for disease severity in COVID-19 [^113eQED6]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

This study seeks to determine the utility of D-dimer levels as a biomarker in determining disease severity and prognosis in COVID-19.

- **Methods**: Clinical, imaging, and laboratory data from 120 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 via RT-PCR were evaluated retrospectively. The severity of COVID-19 was clinically classified as non-complicated, mild, or severe pneumonia. Radiologically, lung areas affected by viral pneumonia on computed tomography were classified as either 0–30% or ≥ 31% of the total lung area. D-dimer values and laboratory data of COVID-19 patients were compared with inpatient status, duration of hospitalization, and lung involvement during treatment and follow-up. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted to assess the predictive value of D-dimer.

- **Results**: D-dimer elevation (> 243 ng/ml) was detected in 63.3% (76/120) of patients. The mean D-dimer value for inpatients with severe pneumonia in the intensive care unit was calculated as 3144.50 ± 1709.4 ng/ml (range 1643–8548). D-dimer values showed positive correlations with age, duration of stay, lung involvement, fibrinogen, neutrophil count, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR). A threshold D-dimer value of 370 ng/ml in the ROC analysis exhibited 77% specificity and 74% sensitivity for lung involvement in COVID-19 patients.

- **Conclusion**: D-dimer levels in patients with COVID-19 correlate with outcomes; however, further studies are needed to determine their utility in clinical settings.

### Knowledge of the D-dimer test result influences clinical probability assessment of pulmonary embolism [^115fEtc2]. Thrombosis Research (2010). Low credibility.

In patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE), an unlikely or non-high probability assessment combined with a normal D-dimer test can safely exclude the diagnosis. We studied the influence of early D-dimer knowledge on clinical probability assessment.

- **Methods**: A questionnaire was sent to 150 randomly selected pulmonologists and internists in the Netherlands, presenting six hypothetical case descriptions of patients with suspected PE. Physicians were randomized to receive one of three versions. The version contained a normal, an abnormal, or no D-dimer result with each case description. Each version included two cases with an abnormal D-dimer result, two cases with a normal D-dimer result, and two cases with no D-dimer result.

- **Results**: A total of 71 physicians (47%) returned the questionnaire; the three versions were equally represented. Compared to the control cases in which no D-dimer was given, knowledge of an abnormal D-dimer resulted in more "likely" clinical scores using the Wells' score (absolute increase in "likely" of 25–37%, p = 0.005, 0.111, and 0.144), while knowledge of a normal D-dimer resulted in more "unlikely" scores (absolute increase in "unlikely" of 27–44%, p = 0.001 and 0.070). D-dimer knowledge did not influence the probability assessment when the clinical suspicion was very high.

- **Conclusion**: Knowledge of the D-dimer test influences the physician in how the clinical probability for PE is scored. This will have direct clinical consequences, such as unnecessary imaging testing or inappropriate exclusion of the diagnosis.

### The accuracy of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay D-dimer test in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism: a meta-analysis [^111YD3Bi]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

We sought to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) D-dimer test in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) in the adult emergency department population.

- **Methods**: A search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and bibliographies of previous systematic reviews was conducted, with no language restriction. Experts in the field of PE research were contacted to identify unpublished studies. Prospective investigations involving a predominantly outpatient population suspected of PE that used ELISA D-dimer tests were included. Two authors extracted data independently and assessed study quality based on the patient spectrum and reference standard. Consensus was reached by means of a conference. The analysis was based on a summary receiver operating characteristic curve and pooled estimates for sensitivity and specificity using a random-effects model.

- **Results**: The search yielded 52 publications, and no unpublished studies were found. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria and provided a sample of 2,126 patients. The summary receiver operating characteristic curve analysis found significant heterogeneity among the 11 studies. Subgroup analysis of the 9 studies that used traditional ELISA D-dimer methods yielded the most valid pooled estimates, with a sensitivity of 0.94 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88 to 0.97) and a specificity of 0.45 (95% CI 0.36 to 0.55). Advanced age resulted in a lower specificity. A prolonged duration of symptoms decreased the sensitivity and specificity.

The ELISA D-dimer test is highly sensitive but has variable specificity, especially impacted by factors such as age and duration of symptoms.

### A highly sensitive ELISA D-dimer increases testing but not diagnosis of pulmonary embolism [^116VPUZn]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of introducing a rapid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) D-dimer on the percentage of emergency department (ED) patients evaluated for pulmonary embolism (PE). This includes the use of associated laboratory testing, pulmonary vascular imaging, and the diagnoses of PE.

- **Methods**: Patients evaluated for PE during three 120-day periods were enrolled: immediately before (period 1), immediately after (period 2), and one year after the introduction of a rapid ELISA D-dimer in the hospital. The frequency of ED patients evaluated for PE with any test, with D-dimer testing, with pulmonary vascular imaging, and the frequency of PE diagnosis during each time period were determined.

- **Results**: The percentage of patients evaluated for PE nearly doubled from 1.36% (328/24,101) in period 1, to 2.58% (654/25,318) in period 2, and 2.42% (583/24,093) in period 3. The percentage of patients who underwent D-dimer testing increased more than fourfold from 0.39% (93/24,101) in period 1, to 1.83% (464/25,318) in period 2, and 1.77% (427/24,093) in period 3. The percentage of patients who underwent pulmonary vascular imaging increased from 1.02% (247/24,101) in period 1, to 1.36% (344/25,318) in period 2, and to 1.39% (334/24,093) in period 3. There was no significant difference in the percentage of patients diagnosed as having PE in period 1 (0.20% [47/24,101]), period 2 (0.27% [69/25,318]), and period 3 (0.24% [58/24,093]).

- **Conclusions**: In the study's academic ED, the introduction of ELISA D-dimer testing was accompanied by an increase in PE evaluations, D-dimer testing, and pulmonary vascular imaging; however, there was no significant change in the diagnosis rate of PE.

### How we manage a high D-dimer [^1144PcsQ]. Haematologica (2024). Low credibility.

The proposed management of ambulatory individuals with high D-dimer levels presents unique challenges. While the role of D-dimer in diagnosing acute illnesses such as venous thromboembolism (VTE), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and sepsis is well-established, managing patients with high D-dimer levels but no evidence of thrombosis, especially in ambulatory care, requires careful consideration. This challenge has gained attention due to the widespread and indiscriminate use of D-dimer testing, particularly during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

When an ostensibly healthy and asymptomatic person is found to have persistently high D-dimer levels, it is important to reassure them by explaining all non-disease-related causes of this abnormality. However, an elevated D-dimer should not be ignored in symptom-free individuals. Such patients should undergo differential diagnostic procedures to rule out any conditions associated with increased D-dimer, ensuring all possible contributing factors are considered in the diagnostic process.

### The diagnostic value of D-dimer with simplified Geneva score (SGS) pre-test in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) [^11288ARg]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a fatal condition induced by a thromboembolus occluding the main pulmonary artery or its branches. It is the third most common acute cardiovascular syndrome after myocardial infarction and stroke. In America, it is estimated that venous thromboembolism, including PE and deep-vein thrombosis (DVT), may induce 300,000 deaths every year using a modeling method. Owing to the use of more effective interventions and better adherence to guidelines, the mortality rate of acute PE has been reduced in many areas of the world. However, there is also a report of over-diagnosis in the current diagnosis of PE. This over-diagnosis may, in turn, induce a false decline in the mortality rate to a certain extent. It is considered that improving the efficiency of PE detection methods and optimizing the detection process would greatly benefit clinical outcomes of acute PE.

A highly sensitive D-dimer test is available for venous thromboembolism diagnosis by exclusion without further testing. Less sensitive, but more specific, D-dimer detection exhibits advantages in identifying patients with low thromboembolism risk. Recent research has indicated that patients with D-dimer levels higher than 2.15 mg/L have a notably increased risk of PE. It is suggested that the role of D-dimer in PE diagnosis should be expanded, beyond just the exclusion diagnosis of PE. According to the ESC guidelines, CTPA is the clinical "gold standard" for the diagnosis of PE.

The Geneva score is a clinical prediction rule to assess PE pre-test probability. The original

### Analytical and clinical validation of a new point-of-care testing system for determination of d-dimer in human blood [^1112T9gQ]. Thrombosis Research (2010). Low credibility.

D-dimer testing is used for exclusion of deep venous thrombosis (DVT). AQT90 FLEX D-dimer (AQT D-dimer) is a novel time-resolved fluorescence-based point-of-care test for quantification of D-dimer in whole blood or plasma. Presently, we have determined the analytical and clinical performance of AQT D-dimer and compared it with four routine D-dimer assays. The within-run CV of AQT D-dimer was 3.8–7.2%, and the between-run CV was 5.7–9.7%. Excellent agreement was found between the D-dimer concentrations recorded in citrate-, heparin-, and EDTA-stabilized blood.

The plasma concentration of D-dimer was determined with AQT D-dimer, AxSYM, Biopool Auto-Dimer, STA-Liatest, and Vidas New in 170 consecutive patients suspected of having DVT. Phlebograms were positive in 64 patients (22 distal, 42 proximal). ROC-curves (ROC), the negative and positive predictive values (NPV, PPV), the sensitivity, and specificity of the tests were compared. The area under the ROC was comparable for all tests. NPV for all DVT was 87–88%, the sensitivity was 88–92%, and the PPV was 45–55%.

- **Proximal DVT**:
	- **NPV and sensitivity**: 100% for all tests
	- **PPV**: 37–48%

- **Distal DVT**:
	- **NPV**: 87–88%
	- **Sensitivity**: 64–77%
	- **PPV**: 19–24%
	- **Specificity**: 32–58%

The AQT D-dimer demonstrates excellent analytical and diagnostic performance. The test is rapidly performed, and the measuring range of the assay is wide. The NPV, PPV, specificity, sensitivity, and AUC of AQT D-dimer for both proximal and distal DVT are comparable to routine D-dimer assays.

### Excluding venous thromboembolism using point of care D-dimer tests in outpatients: a diagnostic meta-analysis [^112vF4ND]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

According to our analysis, using a diagnostic strategy that includes point of care D-dimer testing to rule out venous thromboembolism without the need for imaging, could achieve a post-test probability of 2% or less. This probability threshold is generally accepted as safe because the incidence of venous thromboembolism following normal imaging tests, such as compression ultrasonography in patients suspected of DVT, is also around 1–2%. Applying this "safety threshold" to our results indicates that all point of care D-dimer tests are sufficiently safe in low-risk patients, as they achieved a post-test probability of 0.4–1.1%. Cardiac D-dimer seems to be the only test with the capacity to exclude DVT in patients with a moderate pre-test probability (up to 27%), although only four studies on Cardiac D-dimer were available and thus the 95% confidence interval exceeds 2%.

The decision on which point of care D-dimer test to use depends on the setting. In primary care, the Clearview Simplify D-dimer test has the advantage that it can be performed with capillary blood and does not require any other equipment. This makes it possible to have a test result even when making a house call, although at the expense of a lower sensitivity than the quantitative tests. This user-friendliness is less important in an emergency department setting, where Cardiac D-dimer and Triage D-dimer may be preferable. These two tests might be a better option not only because of their superior accuracy, but also because of other cardiovascular biomarkers, such as brain natriuretic peptides.

### D-dimer level is associated with the severity of COVID-19 [^1135G5h3]. Thrombosis Research (2020). High credibility.

Abnormal coagulation function has been demonstrated to be involved in the disease progression of COVID-19; however, the association between D-dimer levels and the severity of COVID-19 is not yet clear. This study aimed to investigate the association between D-dimer levels and the severity of COVID-19 based on a cohort study and meta-analysis.

- **Materials and methods**: Demographic and clinical data from all confirmed cases of COVID-19 admitted to Tongji Hospital from January 27 to March 5, 2020, were collected and analyzed. Coagulation function parameters were described and compared between patients with severe and non-severe infections. Cohort studies reporting risk estimates for the association between D-dimer levels and the severity of COVID-19 were searched and included to perform a meta-analysis.

- **Results**: In our cohort study, patients with severe disease were more likely to exhibit dysregulated coagulation function. A significantly higher D-dimer level (median 1.8 μg/ml [interquartile range 0.9–4.6] vs. 0.5 [0.3–1.1], p < 0.001) was found in severe cases compared to mild ones upon admission. In the meta-analysis of 13 cohort studies, patients with severe disease had an increase in mean D-dimer value by 0.91 μg/ml (95% confidence interval, 0.51–1.31, p < 0.001) compared to those with non-severe disease. The odds of severe infection were associated with a D-dimer greater than 0.5 μg/ml (odds ratio = 5.78, 95% confidence interval, 2.16–15.44, p < 0.001) upon admission.

- **Conclusions**: Patients with severe COVID-19 have a higher level of D-dimer on admission.

### D-dimer to rule out venous thromboembolism during pregnancy: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1131ESAF]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

We identified 662 potentially relevant studies through the electronic search strategy. Additionally, three more studies were found through other sources. After title and abstract screening using the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, 620 studies were excluded. The remaining 45 studies were retrieved in full for detailed evaluation.

Of the retrieved studies, 41 were excluded for various reasons: duplicate data (n = 10), not addressing our question (n = 21), unclear selection criteria of the study population with suspected selection bias for a population with very high prevalence of PE (n = 2), study design not meeting our inclusion/exclusion criteria (n = 6), including three publications of the same cohort of patients and its secondary analysis, and a validation study of a diagnostic algorithm using the same cohort already analyzed in another paper (n = 1).

We also excluded one study due to concerns about overlapping groups of subjects in two different publications (n = 1), choosing only the first publication (prospective cohort). Therefore, four studies were finally included in this systematic review. The study identification and selection process is detailed in a PRISMA flow diagram of study selection, including included and excluded studies.

### D-dimer levels for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism: Making sense of international guideline recommendations [^112rULpX]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). High credibility.

Several international guidelines provide recommendations around the use of D-dimer testing for exclusion of pulmonary embolism, including the appropriate D-dimer threshold (or cutoff), but there is no consensus among them. We briefly discuss guideline variation, performance characteristics, and limitations of commercially available D-dimer assays in this setting, referencing the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines that recommend immunoassays with high sensitivity (≥ 97%) and negative predictive value (≥ 98%). While age-adjusted D-dimer and pretest-adjusted D-dimer are considered a safe strategy across predefined patient subgroups, clinicians need to recognize the different performance characteristics of D-dimer assays to enable safe clinical decisions for their patients. Importantly, D-dimer values must be correlated not only to clinical findings but also interpreted within the context of the accuracy and precision of the specific testing modality, adhering to manufacturer specifications that are approved by regulatory authorities.

### Rapid quantitative D-dimer to exclude pulmonary embolism: A prospective cohort management study [^117Ls7tB]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

It is not known if D-dimer testing alone can safely exclude pulmonary embolism (PE). We studied the safety of using a quantitative latex agglutination D-dimer to exclude PE in 808 patients. Notably, 52% of patients with suspected PE had a negative D-dimer test and were followed for 3 months. The negative predictive value of D-dimer testing alone was 99.8%, suggesting it may safely exclude PE.

Strategies are needed to exclude pulmonary embolism (PE) efficiently without the need for imaging tests. Although validated rules for clinical probability assessment can be combined with D-dimer testing to safely exclude PE, the rules can be complicated or partially subjective, which limits their use. Thus, our objective was to determine if PE can be safely excluded in patients with a negative D-dimer without incorporating clinical probability assessment.

We enrolled consecutive outpatients and inpatients with suspected PE from four tertiary care hospitals. All patients underwent D-dimer testing using the MDA D-dimer test, a quantitative latex agglutination assay. PE was excluded in patients with a D-dimer less than 750 μg FEU L(-1) without further testing.

Patients with D-dimer levels of 750 μg FEU L(-1) or higher underwent standardized imaging tests for PE. All patients in whom PE was excluded had anticoagulant therapy withheld and were followed for 3 months for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Suspected events during follow-up were adjudicated centrally.

Eight hundred and eight patients were enrolled, of whom 99 (12%) were diagnosed with…

### Appropriate use of D-dimer in hospital patients [^111XAuCs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

D-dimer, the final product of plasmin-mediated degradation of fibrin-rich thrombi, has emerged as a simple blood test that can be used in diagnostic algorithms for the exclusion of venous thromboembolism. It is also used as part of the diagnostic tests for disseminated intravascular coagulation, where excessive thrombin generation is the key pathophysiological factor. However, there are no robust data available at present on the use of this test to exclude venous thromboembolism in hospital inpatients. Considerable confusion also exists among physicians about its appropriate use and interpretation in disseminated intravascular coagulation. This article focuses on the available evidence to guide the appropriate use of D-dimer in patients admitted to a hospital.

### Pregnancy-adapted YEARS algorithm for diagnosis of suspected pulmonary embolism [^115nHpBc]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is one of the leading causes of maternal death in the Western world. Due to the low specificity and sensitivity of the D-dimer test, all pregnant women with suspected pulmonary embolism undergo computed tomographic (CT) pulmonary angiography or ventilation-perfusion scanning, both of which involve radiation exposure to the mother and fetus. Whether a pregnancy-adapted algorithm could be used to safely avoid diagnostic imaging in pregnant women with suspected pulmonary embolism is unknown.

- **Methods**: In a prospective study involving pregnant women with suspected pulmonary embolism, we assessed three criteria from the YEARS algorithm: clinical signs of deep-vein thrombosis, hemoptysis, and pulmonary embolism as the most likely diagnosis. We also measured the D-dimer level. Pulmonary embolism was ruled out if none of the three criteria were met and the D-dimer level was less than 1000 ng per milliliter, or if one or more of the three criteria were met and the D-dimer level was less than 500 ng per milliliter. The adaptation of the YEARS algorithm for pregnant women involved compression ultrasonography for women with symptoms of deep-vein thrombosis; if the results were positive (i.e. a clot was present), CT pulmonary angiography was not performed. All patients in whom pulmonary embolism had not been ruled out underwent CT pulmonary angiography. The primary outcome was the incidence of venous thromboembolism at 3 months, and the secondary outcome was the proportion of patients in whom CT pulmonary angiography was not indicated to safely rule out pulmonary embolism.

### Failure rate of D-dimer testing in patients with high clinical probability of pulmonary embolism: Ancillary analysis of three European studies [^114RSZMV]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Patients were included if they had a high clinical probability of PE and a D-dimer measurement in the ED. Patients who had a high clinical probability of PE and underwent D-dimer testing were sourced from the PROPER, MODIGLIANI, and TRYSPEED databases. In the PROPER and MODIGLIANI cohorts, a high PE clinical probability was defined as having either a Wells score greater than 6 or a revised Geneva score greater than 10. Although these cohorts aimed to evaluate patients with a low clinical probability of PE assessed through clinical gestalt, some patients were still classified as high risk because the Wells and Geneva scores objectively quantify risk, sometimes revealing a higher risk level than the clinician's initial assessment. The revised Geneva score was solely used for patients in the TRYSPEED database due to the lack of the "absence of alternative diagnosis" item required for the Wells score.

The PROPER cohort consisted of 1916 patients from 14 EDs in France, who visited the ED between 2015 and 2016 with a low gestalt clinical probability of PE. The MODIGLIANI cohort included 1414 patients from 16 EDs in France and two in Spain, who had low to moderate clinical gestalt probability of PE and did not have a negative PERC. The TRYSPEED study included 8970 patients who underwent CTPA in the ED for suspected PE, from 26 European EDs across six countries, during the first 7 days of each month from January 2015 to December 2019. Patients were excluded if they had a missing D-dimer value or no Wells and no revised Geneva score available and if there was no assessment.

### Diagnostic value of D-dimer in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism: Results from a multicentre outcome study [^111JLWhS]. Thrombosis Research (2007). Low credibility.

D-dimer tests are used in various diagnostic strategies to exclude pulmonary embolism (PE); however, their role as an exclusionary first-line test is still uncertain, mainly because the accuracy of the test varies according to the assay and the studied population.

- **Methods**: The aim of this multicentre study was to evaluate the accuracy of D-dimer testing in patients with suspected PE. Diagnosis of PE was based on pre-test clinical probability (PCP) evaluation and both single-detector spiral CT (CT) and lower limbs compression ultrasonography (CUS). Lung scanning and/or pulmonary angiography was mandatory when CT or CUS was inconclusive and when both CT and CUS were normal in a patient with a high PCP. All patients were followed-up for 3 months, looking for VTE recurrence. D-dimers were collected within 24 hours of inclusion and stored in each local hematology unit, to be analyzed at the end of all inclusions; physicians in charge of the patient were blinded to D-dimer results.

- **Results**: Three hundred and fifty-two patients were included in four centers. The prevalence of PE was 38.6%. PCP was low in 82 (23.3%), intermediate in 176 (50%), and high in 94 (26.7%) patients. Sensitivity of D-dimer was 96.3% (95% CI: 93–99) and the negative predictive value reached 94.4% (95% CI: 90–99). Five patients with a confirmed PE had a D-dimer level below 500 ng/ml (two patients with a high PCP). Among 258 patients with low or intermediate PCP, 80 (31%) had a negative D-dimer test result; three of them had a false negative result and the number needed to test was 3.3.

### A prospective evaluation of a quantitative D-dimer assay in the evaluation of acute pulmonary embolism [^111PeDXK]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

A prospective study was designed to determine if a screening quantitative serum D-dimer measurement of 1.0 microg/mL or less precludes pulmonary computed tomographic (CT) angiography in patients with possible acute pulmonary embolism (PE).

- **Materials and methods**: Over a period of 16 months, every patient seen in the emergency department with clinical suspicion of PE, warranting pulmonary CT angiography, was also requested to have a quantitative serum D-dimer level measurement taken. All pulmonary CT angiography procedures were performed on a four-slice scanner, and every examination was overread by a radiologist blinded to the D-dimer assay results. Three-month medical record and telephone follow-up were carried out for all participants with a serum D-dimer level of 1.0 microg/mL or less to verify no new diagnosis or death from PE.

- **Results**: In this prospective study, 361 consecutive patients who received pulmonary CT angiography had a D-dimer level of 1.0 microg/mL or less. There were 310 patients with negative pulmonary CT angiography results and 50 patients with indeterminate CT angiography results. Only one patient had positive pulmonary CT angiography findings. Minimum 3-month follow-up information was available for 349 patients, none of whom reported subsequent PE, including those with indeterminate pulmonary CT angiography results.

- **Conclusion**: The use of a screening D-dimer measurement of 1.0 microg/mL or less precludes pulmonary CT angiography in patients with possible acute PE.

### How we manage a high D-dimer [^112DozZL]. Haematologica (2024). High credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a severe, often life-threatening syndrome characterized by diffuse and persistent activation of the hemostatic system with intravascular thrombin generation and fibrin formation and degradation. Early recognition of DIC is crucial to allow prompt treatment, the primary aim of which is to eliminate the underlying condition (i.e. sepsis, malignancy, trauma, obstetric diseases). D-dimer has become a cornerstone in the diagnosis of DIC because, thanks to its excellent negative predictive value, the use of D-dimer measurement in this context has been endorsed by all national and international guidelines. For example, the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) not only validated a scoring system (including prothrombin time, platelet count, fibrinogen, and D-dimer levels) for its diagnostic and prognostic value, but also recommended sequential D-dimer measurements to monitor DIC evolution and to guide clinical and therapeutic management.

- **Cancer, inflammation, and infection**: The activation of coagulation is a common finding in malignant tumors, being associated with growth and progression. As a consequence, up to 20% of cancer patients develop VTE, which is the second leading cause of death. D-dimer is over-produced in the presence of active malignancy and levels are increased in a variety of tumors. However, the common finding of high D-dimer in cancer, even in the absence of thrombosis, limits the diagnostic usefulness of this test. Nevertheless, incorporating D-dimer measurement is crucial in the management of such cases.

### Potential of an age adjusted D-dimer cut-off value to improve the exclusion of pulmonary embolism in older patients: a retrospective analysis of three large cohorts [^11452w79]. BMJ (2010). High credibility.

Measurement of D-dimer concentration in the blood is a valuable tool in the diagnostic investigation of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. A D-dimer concentration below the conventional cut-off point of 500 μg/l, combined with a "low/intermediate" or "unlikely" clinical probability, can safely rule out the diagnosis in about 30% of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. However, the D-dimer concentration increases with age and its specificity for embolism decreases, which makes the test less useful to exclude pulmonary embolism in older patients. Indeed, the test is able to rule out pulmonary embolism in 60% of patients aged 80.

If the D-dimer test is combined with an "unlikely" clinical probability to rule out pulmonary embolism, 10% of patients over 75 years old versus 32% of patients of all ages do not need further diagnostic testing; the number needed to test for one negative test result is 10.6 and 3.1, respectively. Raising the cut-off value to various points between 600 μg/l and 1000 μg/l increased specificity, but this came at the cost of safety, with more false-negative test results. In this analysis, however, no stratification was made for clinical probability.

By constructing receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves, we derived a new, age-dependent D-dimer cut-off value and analyzed its safety and clinical utility, in combination with clinical probability assessment, for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism in two large prospective cohort studies of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism.

### An evaluation of D-dimer in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism: A randomized trial [^115J9k13]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

It may be safe to omit additional diagnostic testing in selected patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) who have a negative D-dimer test, but this approach has never been evaluated in a randomized, controlled trial.

- **Objective**: To determine if additional diagnostic testing can be safely withheld in patients with suspected PE who have negative erythrocyte agglutination D-dimer test results.

- **Design**: Randomized comparisons in two subgroups of a prospective multicenter study.

- **Setting**: Seven university hospitals.

- **Patients**: 1,126 outpatients or inpatients with suspected PE; of these, 456 patients with negative erythrocyte agglutination D-dimer test results were randomly assigned to the intervention groups. Patients were classified into two clinical probability groups: those with a low clinical probability of PE (low-probability group), and those with a moderate or high clinical probability of PE, a nondiagnostic ventilation-perfusion lung scan, and no evidence of proximal deep venous thrombosis on bilateral ultrasonography (moderate- or high-probability group).

- **Interventions**: The experimental intervention for both probability groups was no further diagnostic testing for PE. The control intervention for the low-probability group was a ventilation-perfusion lung scan followed by ultrasonography of the proximal deep veins of the legs on the same day. If the lung scan was nondiagnostic, ultrasonography of the legs was repeated 7 and 14 days later. The control intervention for the moderate- or high-probability group was ultrasonography of the proximal deep veins of the.

### Advocating prudent D-dimer testing: Constructive perspectives and comments on 'How we manage a high D-dimer' [^113VjdMm]. Haematologica (2024). Low credibility.

For these reasons, we suggest that instead of recommending an evaluation algorithm for elevated D-dimer tests in asymptomatic ambulatory individuals, the focus should shift back towards avoiding unnecessary medical tests. Such efforts could lead to the better education of healthcare professionals on the rational prescription of these tests, ensuring effective and appropriate use based on solid clinical reasoning and a specific patient context.

### Failure rate of D-dimer testing in patients with high clinical probability of pulmonary embolism: Ancillary analysis of three European studies [^116575yR]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Our study presents some limitations. First, the post hoc nature of the analysis may introduce biases inherent to retrospective analyses. Another limitation to consider is the heterogeneity of the included studies. One study relies solely on retrospective CTPA data without a 3-month follow-up, while the others include prospective follow-up. The lack of follow-up and the exclusion of inconclusive CTPA in the TRYSPEED study might result in an underestimation of the strategy's failure rate. Since most of the patients are from the TRYSPEED study, which is retrospective with no subsequent follow-up, D-dimer levels are compared mostly to CTPA results rather than to the usual clinical follow-up period. However, it is important to note that if a patient had a PE at 3 months but not at the initial evaluation on CTPA (i.e. patients from the TRYSPEED study), this would correspond to a failure of CTPA and not related to our aim of assessing the failure rate of D-dimer.

Although patients in the analysis have been identified as having a high probability of PE based on the Wells or revised Geneva scores, they might still be inherently at lower risk because the original studies (PROPER and MODIGLIANI) were designed to evaluate patients with a low probability of PE as assessed by clinical gestalt. This difference occurs because the Geneva and Wells scores objectively quantify risk by incorporating specific criteria, offering a more consistent approach to risk assessment that can reveal a higher risk level than the clinician's initial impression.

### Excluding venous thromboembolism using point of care D-dimer tests in outpatients: A diagnostic meta-analysis [^115RZgK9]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

Overall analysis

The pooled sensitivity and specificity of all studies combined were 0.88 (95% confidence interval 0.83 to 0.92) and 0.70 (0.62 to 0.77), respectively. The between-study variability, beyond what could be expected by sampling error, was substantial, with an I² of 80% for the sensitivity results and 96% for the specificity results. Analysis of small study effects, potentially a result of publication bias, yielded no significant evidence for such effects (P = 0.23).

Per-test analyses

The pooled sensitivity (based on the bivariate model) of SimpliRED, Clearview Simplify, and Cardiac D-dimer was 0.85 (95% confidence interval 0.78 to 0.90), 0.87 (0.81 to 0.91), and 0.96 (0.91 to 0.98), respectively; the overall specificity was 0.74 (0.69 to 0.78), 0.62 (0.54 to 0.69), and 0.57 (0.52 to 0.62), respectively. As only two studies evaluated Triage D-dimer, an overall sensitivity and specificity could not be calculated using the bivariate approach. The traditional sample size weighted approach yielded an average sensitivity of 0.93 (0.88 to 0.97) and specificity of 0.48 (0.33 to 0.62).

### Evaluation of D-dimer in the diagnosis of suspected deep-vein thrombosis [^116GVzsh]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2003). High credibility.

Several diagnostic strategies using ultrasound imaging, measurement of D-dimer, and assessment of clinical probability of disease have proved safe in patients with suspected deep-vein thrombosis; however, they have not been compared in randomized trials.

- **Methods**: Outpatients presenting with suspected lower-extremity deep-vein thrombosis were potentially eligible. Using a clinical model, physicians evaluated the patients and categorized them as likely or unlikely to have deep-vein thrombosis. The patients were then randomly assigned to undergo ultrasound imaging alone (control group) or to undergo D-dimer testing (D-dimer group). If the D-dimer test was negative and the patient was considered clinically unlikely to have deep-vein thrombosis, ultrasound imaging was not performed.

- **Results**: A total of 530 patients were randomly assigned to the control group, and 566 to the D-dimer group. The overall prevalence of deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism was 15.7 percent. Among patients for whom deep-vein thrombosis had been ruled out by the initial diagnostic strategy, there were two confirmed venous thromboembolic events in the D-dimer group (0.4 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.05 to 1.5 percent) and six events in the control group (1.4 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.5 to 2.9 percent; P = 0.16) during three months of follow-up. The use of D-dimer testing resulted in a significant reduction in the use of ultrasonography, from a mean of 1.34 tests per patient in the control group to 0.78.

### D-dimer testing to determine the duration of anticoagulation therapy [^116Mqtnj]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). High credibility.

The PROLONG study, published by Palareti G and colleagues in 2006 in The New England Journal of Medicine, focuses on pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. The trial investigates the role of D-dimer testing in determining the duration of anticoagulation therapy for patients with a first idiopathic episode of venous thromboembolism (VTE).

The study design was a multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 223 patients (118 female, 105 male). Patients included had a first unprovoked proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) and had received a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for at least three months before undergoing D-dimer testing. Key exclusion criteria were serious liver disease, renal insufficiency, other indications or contraindications for anticoagulation, or a limited life expectancy.

- **Interventions**:
	- 120 patients with an abnormal D-dimer level discontinued anticoagulation (discontinuation of VKA therapy).
	- 103 patients with an abnormal D-dimer level resumed anticoagulation (resumption of VKA therapy).

- **Outcomes**:
	- **Primary outcome**: There was a significant increase in the recurrence of thromboembolism (15% versus 2.9%; adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 4.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23 to 14.6).
	- **Safety outcomes**: No significant difference in deaths was observed.

The study concluded that in patients with a first unprovoked proximal DVT or PE who had received a VKA for at least three months and underwent D-dimer testing, an abnormal D-dimer level followed by discontinuation of anticoagulation was inferior to resumption in terms of preventing thromboembolism recurrence.

### Is stand-alone D-dimer testing safe to rule out acute pulmonary embolism [^114UCWnd]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). Low credibility.

A stand-alone D-dimer below 750 μg/L has been proposed to rule out acute pulmonary embolism (PE). This was a post-hoc analysis of data from six studies comprising 7,268 patients with suspected PE. The negative predictive value (NPV) of a D-dimer < 750 μg/L ranged from 79% to 96% in various subgroups. Stand-alone D-dimer testing seems to be unsafe to rule out PE in all patients.

- **Background**: Recently, stand-alone D-dimer testing at a positivity threshold of 750 μg/L has been proposed as a safe and efficient approach to rule out acute pulmonary embolism (PE) without additional imaging, but this approach needs validation.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate stand-alone D-dimer testing at a positivity threshold of 750 μg/L to rule out PE.

- **Methods**: Individual data from 7,268 patients with suspected PE previously enrolled in six prospective management studies were used. Patients were assessed using the Wells rule followed by quantitative D-dimer testing in those with a 'PE unlikely' score. Patients were classified post hoc as having a negative (< 750 μg/L) or positive (≥ 750 μg/L) D-dimer. Using a one-stage meta-analytic approach, the NPV of stand-alone D-dimer testing was evaluated overall and in different risk subgroups.

- **Results**: The pooled incidence of PE was 23% (range, 13–42%). Overall, 44% of patients had a D-dimer < 750 μg/L, of whom 2.8% were diagnosed with PE at baseline or during the 3-month follow-up (NPV, 97.2%; 95% confidence interval, 94.9–98.5). The NPV was highest in patients with a low probability of PE according to the Wells score.

### Clinical prediction rules for pulmonary embolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115bZcvh]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2010). Low credibility.

Pretest probability assessment is essential for identifying patients in whom pulmonary embolism (PE) can be safely ruled out by a negative D-dimer without further investigations. The objective of this study is to review and compare the performance of available clinical prediction rules (CPRs) for PE probability assessment.

We identified studies that evaluated a CPR in patients with suspected PE from Embase, Medline, and the Cochrane database. We determined the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the prevalence of PE in the various clinical probability categories of each CPR, and statistical heterogeneity was tested.

We identified nine CPRs and included 29 studies representing 31,215 patients.

- **Pooled prevalence of PE for three-level scores**:
	- **Wells score**: Low, 6% (95% CI, 4–8); Intermediate, 23% (95% CI, 18–28); High, 49% (95% CI, 43–56)
	- **Geneva score**: Low, 13% (95% CI, 8–19); Intermediate, 35% (95% CI, 31–38); High, 71% (95% CI, 50–89)
	- **Revised Geneva score**: Low, 9% (95% CI, 8–11); Intermediate, 26% (95% CI, 24–28); High, 76% (95% CI, 69–82)

- **Pooled prevalence for two-level scores**:
	- **Wells score**: PE likely, 34% (95% CI, 29–40); PE unlikely, 8% (95% CI, 6–11)
	- **Charlotte rule**: PE likely, 23% (95% CI, 11–36); PE unlikely, 6% (95% CI, 3–9)

Available CPRs for assessing clinical probability of PE show similar accuracy. Existing scores are not equivalent, howev
