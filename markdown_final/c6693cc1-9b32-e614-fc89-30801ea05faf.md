## Question

A fracture is seen relating to the proximal aspect of the left third proximal phalange. Minimal displacement. The joint does not appear involved. There is no evidence of any rotational deformity. Callus formation is present consistent with the timing of the original injury. Treatment recommendations

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment recommendations for a minimally displaced, extra-articular proximal phalanx fracture of the left ring finger with callus formation and no rotational deformity. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fracture pattern and stability. Then, I should verify the indications for nonoperative versus operative management. Next, I will review the best nonoperative approach, including splinting, buddy taping, and rehabilitation. After that, I need to check follow-up imaging needs and timelines. Finally, I will consider special scenarios, counseling points, and summarize a practical plan with citations.

> Let me first confirm the injury pattern and stability. A proximal phalanx fracture that is minimally displaced, extra-articular, and without rotational deformity is typically stable and amenable to nonoperative care, especially when callus is already forming, indicating early healing and reduced risk of secondary displacement [^f7796aa3] [^a1a63e89].

> Wait, let me verify the indications for surgery before jumping to conclusions. Operative fixation is generally reserved for unstable patterns, intra-articular involvement, marked angulation or displacement, rotational deformity, or failure of closed reduction; none of those are present here, so surgery is not indicated in this case [^f7796aa3] [^a1a63e89].

> I will now examine the nonoperative approach. For a stable proximal phalanx fracture, immobilization with a hand-based splint that keeps the metacarpophalangeal joint flexed and the interphalangeal joints free, combined with buddy taping to an adjacent finger to control rotation, is appropriate; this balances protection with early motion to limit stiffness [^f7796aa3] [^c166cdf4].

> Hold on, I should verify the duration of immobilization. Initially, I thought 4–6 weeks might be needed, but wait, let me reconsider in light of pediatric data suggesting that many clinically healed proximal phalangeal fractures can safely stop immobilization at 3 weeks; while this RCT is in children, it supports the principle that early motion can be introduced once clinical stability is evident, and in adults, 3–4 weeks is commonly sufficient for extra-articular proximal phalanx fractures with early callus, followed by progressive motion [^b3eb552a] [^f7796aa3].

> Next, I should review rehabilitation. Early active range of motion within a protected arc, tendon-gliding exercises, and gradual strengthening are essential to prevent adhesions and stiffness; buddy taping during early motion helps control rotation and pain while allowing function [^c166cdf4] [^f7796aa3].

> I need to ensure follow-up and imaging are appropriate. For a stable, minimally displaced extra-articular fracture with early callus, routine repeat radiographs are not mandatory if the patient remains asymptomatic and clinically aligned; however, a single follow-up at about 2–3 weeks to confirm maintenance of alignment and to transition to motion is reasonable, with earlier imaging if pain worsens or deformity is suspected [^d4fb4e01] [^f7796aa3].

> But wait, what if the patient is a child or has unique risk factors? In children, most proximal phalangeal fractures heal reliably with nonoperative care, and early functional protocols can be effective; in adults with high-demand hand use, the same principles of stability assessment and early motion apply, with shared decision-making if concerns about stiffness or subtle malalignment arise [^8e869d64] [^b42a3226] [^f7796aa3].

> I should double-check potential complications and counseling. The main risks are stiffness, mild angular or rotational malunion, and rarely nonunion; given the early callus and stable pattern, nonunion is unlikely, and stiffness risk is mitigated by early motion; the patient should be counseled to watch for progressive deformity, increasing pain, or loss of motion that would prompt reassessment [^f7796aa3] [^a1a63e89].

> Let me summarize the practical plan. Continue with a hand-based splint for approximately 3–4 weeks, keeping the MCP joint flexed and IP joints free, with buddy taping to the middle finger to control rotation; initiate early active range of motion once pain and swelling allow, typically after 2–3 weeks; advance to strengthening and gradual return to full activity by 6–8 weeks as tolerated; arrange a single follow-up at 2–3 weeks to confirm alignment and guide rehabilitation progression, with earlier evaluation if symptoms worsen [^f7796aa3] [^c166cdf4] [^b3eb552a].

For a minimally displaced, extra-articular proximal phalanx fracture with callus and no rotation, **nonoperative management is appropriate** [^f7796aa3]. Use a **short splint or buddy taping for 3–4 weeks**, then advance to gentle active range of motion and strengthening. No routine repeat radiographs are needed unless pain, deformity, or function declines. Expect full recovery in 6–8 weeks with low risk of stiffness or nonunion.

---

## Clinical significance of findings

- **Minimal displacement**: Indicates stable alignment and low risk of secondary displacement.
- **No joint involvement**: Reduces risk of arthritis and preserves motion.
- **No rotational deformity**: Prevents functional impairment and cosmetic issues.
- **Callus formation**: Confirms early healing and low risk of nonunion.

---

## Indications for nonoperative management

Nonoperative care is indicated for **stable, minimally displaced, extra-articular proximal phalanx fractures without rotational deformity** [^f7796aa3]. Key criteria include:

- **Stability**: Minimal displacement and intact cortices.
- **Alignment**: Acceptable angulation (< 10–15 degrees) and no rotation.
- **Function**: No tendon or ligament injury affecting motion.

---

## Recommended nonoperative treatment

### Immobilization

Use a **short splint** (e.g. aluminum foam) or buddy taping to an adjacent finger for 3–4 weeks [^53d2f340]. Maintain the MCP joint in 20–30 degrees of flexion and the PIP/DIP joints free to preserve motion.

---

### Rehabilitation

Begin **gentle active range of motion** after 3–4 weeks and progress to strengthening and functional exercises. Early motion helps prevent stiffness and tendon adhesions [^c166cdf4].

---

### Follow-up

Arrange clinical follow-up at 2–3 weeks to confirm alignment and function; **routine repeat radiographs are not needed** unless pain, deformity, or function worsens [^d4fb4e01].

---

## Expected outcomes and prognosis

- **Healing**: Union typically occurs in 4–6 weeks.
- **Function**: Full recovery of motion and strength expected by 6–8 weeks.
- **Complications**: Low risk of stiffness, malunion, or nonunion with stable, minimally displaced fractures [^notfound].

---

## Potential complications and risks

- **Stiffness**: Mild stiffness may occur but usually resolves with therapy.
- **Malunion**: Rare with stable, minimally displaced fractures.
- **Nonunion**: Rare in this pattern.

---

## Patient education and counseling

Explain the **injury and healing** to set expectations. Emphasize adherence to immobilization and the rehabilitation plan. Instruct on warning signs that require urgent review, such as increasing pain, deformity, or loss of function.

---

## Summary of treatment plan

| **Phase** | **Intervention** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Immobilization | Short splint or buddy taping | 3–4 weeks |
| Rehabilitation | Active ROM, strengthening | Weeks 4–8 |
| Follow-up | Clinical check at 2–3 weeks | Once |
| Return to activity | Full function | 6–8 weeks |

---

Nonoperative care is appropriate for a minimally displaced, extra-articular proximal phalanx fracture with callus and no rotation; **immobilize for 3–4 weeks**, then advance to motion and strengthening, with a single clinical follow-up and excellent expected outcomes.

### Proximal phalanx fracture management [^f7796aa3]. Hand (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The goal of proximal phalangeal fracture management is to allow for fracture healing to occur in acceptable alignment while maintaining gliding motion of the extensor and flexor tendons.

Methods

We reviewed the most current literature on various treatment methods of proximal phalanx fractures, focusing on the indications and outcomes of nonoperative as well as operative interventions.

Results

Stable fractures can be successfully treated nonoperatively, whereas unstable injuries benefit from surgery. Regardless of the surgical intervention employed, the overriding goal is to restore anatomy and impart enough stability to allow for early motion. The surgical dissection contributes to soft tissue scarring and should be minimized.

Conclusions

Clinical success is achieved when acceptable fracture alignment and stability occur in the setting of unobstructed tendon gliding and early active range of motion.

Phalangeal fractures of the foot are very rare in children. They are treated with closed reduction and splinting. Cases reported of non-union in children are rare. We report on treatment of a 4-year-old child with non-union of the proximal phalanx of the great toe foot following an open fracture caused by a motor vehicle accident 4 months prior. No graft was used. We present this case with good clinical outcome at 1 year follow-up.

### Diagnosis and management of common foot fractures… [^808519d0]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Examination of the metatarsals should include palpation of the metatarsal base, shaft, and head, as well as examination of the proximal tarsometatarsal and distal metatarsophalangeal joints. Adjacent metatarsals should be examined, and neurovascular status should be assessed. MANAGEMENT Nondisplaced acute metatarsal shaft fractures generally heal well without complications. Minimally displaced fractures of the second to fifth metatarsal shafts. and fractures with less than 10° of dorsoplantar angulation in the absence of other injuries can generally be managed in the same manner as nondisplaced fractures. 2–4, 6 Initial management includes immobilization in a posterior splint, use of crutches, and avoidance of weight-bearing activities. Patients should be instructed to apply ice, elevate the foot above heart level, and use analgesics as needed.

Follow-up should occur within three to five days to allow for reduction of soft tissue swelling. At the first follow-up visit, radiography should be performed to assure fracture stability. If stable, the patient can be transitioned to a short leg walking cast or boot. MANAGEMENT: TUBEROSITY AVULSION FRACTURES Minimally displaced avulsion fractures typically require immobilization and support with a short leg walking boot. Evidence has shown that, depending on symptoms, short leg walking boots are superior to short leg walking casts. MANAGEMENT: JONES FRACTURES Initial management of a Jones fracture includes a posterior splint and avoidance of weight-bearing activity, with follow-up in three to five days. After that, nonsurgical treatment options include six to eight weeks of short leg non–weight-bearing cast with radiographic follow-up to document healing at six to eight weeks.

MANAGEMENT: LESSER TOE FRACTURES Initial management of lesser toe fractures includes buddy taping to an adjacent toe, use of a rigid-sole shoe, and ambulation as tolerated. Initial follow-up should occur within one to two weeks, then every two to four weeks for a total healing time of four to six weeks. 6, 23, 24 Radiographic follow-up in seven to 10 days is necessary for fractures that required reduction or that involve more than 25% of the joint. 6.

### An evidence-based guide for managing phalangeal fractures [^a1a63e89]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Learning Objectives

After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Describe treatment options for phalangeal fractures. 2. Choose an appropriate fracture management plan that optimizes patient goals and range of motion. 3. Describe closed and open reduction techniques of commonly encountered phalangeal fracture patterns.

Summary

Phalangeal fractures are the second most common upper extremity fracture. Although many can be treated with splinting, operative intervention may be required for unstable fracture patterns and those involving the articular surface. Failure to appropriately treat these fractures can result in finger stiffness, loss in range of motion, and functional deficits. The type of fixation method can range from percutaneous pinning to open reduction and internal fixation. This article presents a series of cases to illustrate the appropriate management of phalangeal fractures using an evidence-based approach.

### What middle phalanx base fracture characteristics are most reliable and useful for surgical decision-making? [^337cbc9c]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Fracture-dislocations of the proximal interphalangeal joint are vexing because subluxation and articular damage can lead to arthrosis and the treatments are imperfect. Ideally, a surgeon could advise a patient, based on radiographs, when the risk of problems merits operative intervention, but it is unclear if middle phalanx base fracture characteristics are sufficiently reliable to be useful for surgical decision making.

Questions/Purposes

We evaluated (1) the degree of interobserver agreement as a function of fracture characteristics, (2) the differences in interobserver agreement between experienced and less-experienced hand surgeons, and (3) what fracture characteristics and surgeon characteristics were associated with the decision for operative treatment.

Methods

Ninety-nine (33%) of 296 hand surgeons evaluated 21 intraarticular middle phalanx base fractures on lateral radiographs. Eighty-one surgeons (82%) were in academic practice and 57 (58%) had less than 10 years experience. Participants assessed six fracture characteristics and recommended treatment (nonoperative or operative: extension block pinning, external fixation, open reduction and internal fixation, volar plate arthroplasty, or hemihamate autograft arthroplasty) for all cases.

Results

With all surgeons pooled together, the interobserver agreement for fracture characteristics was substantial for assessment of a 2-mm articular step or gap (kappa, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.60–0.86; p < 0.001), subluxation or dislocation (kappa, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.58–0.86; p < 0.001), and percentage of articular surface involved (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC], 0.67; 95% CI, 0.54–0.81; p < 0.001); moderate for comminution (kappa, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.39–0.70; p < 0.001) and stability (kappa, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.39–0.69; p < 0.001); and fair for the number of fracture fragments (ICC, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.27–0.57; p < 0.001). When recommending treatment, interobserver agreement was substantial (kappa, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.50–0.88; p < 0.001) for the recommendation to operate or not to operate, but only fair (kappa, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.21–0.47; p < 0.001) for the specific type of treatment, indicating variation in operative techniques. There were no differences in agreement for any of the fracture characteristics or treatment preference between less-experienced and more-experienced surgeons, although statistical power on this comparison was low. None of the surgeon characteristics was associated with the decision for operative treatment, whereas all fracture characteristics were, except for stable and uncertain joint stability. Articular step or gap (β, 0.90; R-squared, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.75–1.05; p < 0.001), likelihood of subluxation or dislocation (β, 0.80; R-squared, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59–1.02; p < 0.001), and unstable fractures (β, 0.88; R-squared, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.67–1.1; p < 0.001), are most strongly associated with the decision for operative treatment.

Conclusions

We found that assessment of a step or gap and likelihood of subluxation were most reliable and are strongly associated with the decision for operative treatment. Surgeons largely agree on which fractures might benefit from surgery, and the variation seems to be with the operative technique. Efforts at improving the care of these fractures should focus on the comparative effectiveness of the various operative treatment options.

### Adequate union rates for the treatment of acute proximal fifth metatarsal fractures [^5138de7a]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Non-displaced acute tuberosity (zone 1) avulsion fractures are preferably treated conservatively given comparable union rates and clinical outcomes were found, regardless of chosen management, and fracture healing is typically uncomplicated. Ideal management of displaced zone 1 fractures remains unclear due to the small number of cases identified, although available evidence suggests that both conservative and surgical treatment demonstrate comparable union rates. Acute zone 2 fractures were found to have higher union rates and faster time to union when managed surgically, which the current literature supports as the treatment of choice for all such injuries. Acute zone 3 fractures continue to be rarely reported in the literature, so treatment outcomes remain insufficiently documented and thus preclude any formal management recommendation. Higher level of evidence research on proximal fifth metatarsal fractures will be necessary to provide more definitive conclusions.

### Operative fractures of the phalangeal head and neck in children-does open reduction affect outcomes? [^87bdc31d]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Pediatric phalangeal neck fractures can be challenging to treat. Displaced fractures are often unstable, and the potential exists for nonunion and poor remodeling. Many authors recommend percutaneous pin fixation of these fractures with either open or closed reduction to reduce those risks. Delayed presentation of these fractures provides additional challenges as a closed reduction may not be sufficient to achieve adequate alignment, and open reduction increases the risk for postoperative stiffness and other complications.

Two previous authors have described AVN complications as a result of open reduction. To mitigate this risk, some surgeons avoid open treatment until no other alternative is viable. Waters et aldescribed their treatment of 8 patients with percutaneous osteoclasis through the dorsal callus for malunions. They described good results with no cases of AVN. Nearly all reports discuss AVN in the setting of closed injuries with open treatment, and few reports exist regarding the rate after open injuries. Our results show that opening the fracture either surgically or at the time of injury increases the postoperative risk of AVN compared with closed treatment. The OI and COR study groups had higher proportions of high energy mechanisms, including crush injuries and concomitant injuries, than the CCR group. This supports that the differences in outcomes are related to the higher amount of initial trauma that each finger sustains. Soft tissue injury from the initial mechanism as well as the surgical procedure, increases the risk for stiffness and less than optimal range of motion postprocedure. In addition, open treatment was more likely to be required for fractures that were intra-articular, as they are often more difficult to treat and involve smaller bone fragments which may be more vulnerable to vascular compromise. Our data supports this, as intra-articular fractures demonstrated a higher rate of AVN than extra-articular fractures. Fractures of the joint surface may also comprise the motion of the joint. Parents of patients with open injuries, intra-articular fractures, and fractures that may require open reduction should be counselled appropriately to the increased risk of AVN of their child's fracture and increased likelihood of a less than the excellent outcome.

Diagnosis and treatment of distal phalangeal fingertip fractures — stable transverse, oblique, and vertical fracture patterns are listed with "splinting of stable fractures for 3–4 weeks; displaced fractures unable to achieve closed reduction may require open reduction and fixation before stabilization for 4–6 weeks", while base patterns include non–intra-articular fractures "usually managed with splinting for 3–4 weeks; in rare cases may require surgery for notable displacement or instability", and intra-articular fractures that "may be managed with splinting for 3–4 weeks; if fracture involves one-third or more of joint surface, referral to hand specialist required for open reduction and fixation for stability"; tuft injuries are "usually managed conservatively with splinting or buddy taping for 3–4 weeks".

### Evaluation and management of toe fractures [^17ea50b6]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Fractures of the toe are one of the most common lower extremity fractures diagnosed by family physicians. Toe fractures most frequently are caused by a crushing injury or axial force such as stubbing a toe. Joint hyperextension and stress fractures are less common. Most patients have point tenderness at the fracture site or pain with gentle axial loading of the digit. Anteroposterior and oblique radiographs generally are most useful for identifying fractures, determining displacement, and evaluating adjacent phalanges and digits. Referral is indicated in patients with circulatory compromise, open fractures, significant soft tissue injury, fracture-dislocations, displaced intra-articular fractures, or fractures of the first toe that are unstable or involve more than 25 percent of the joint surface. Most children with fractures of the physis should be referred, but children with selected nondisplaced Salter-Harris types I and II fractures may be treated by family physicians. Stable, nondisplaced toe fractures should be treated with buddy taping and a rigid-sole shoe to limit joint movement. Displaced fractures of the lesser toes should be treated with reduction and buddy taping. Patients with displaced fractures of the first toe often require referral for stabilization of the reduction.

### Pinckney fracture: do not underestimate trauma of the distal phalanx of the hallux [^856cf79e]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Background

This case report highlights that not every stubbed toe in the paediatric population is straightforward. Therefore, clinicians should be aware not only of the possibility of a physeal injury but also of the high probability of a nail bed soft tissue injury, resulting in an open fracture that requires early treatment to prevent morbidity and increased treatment costs.

### Advances in hand therapy: best practice in conservative management of proximal phalangeal fractures in children [^b3eb552a]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Proximal phalangeal fractures are one of the most commonly treated hand injuries in children. Conservative management of these fractures is often to splint for 5 weeks post injury, despite children presenting as clinically healed at 3 weeks post injury. Therefore, we investigated the effect of splinting for only 3 weeks in children who present with clinically healed proximal phalangeal fractures at 3 weeks compared with usual care.

Methods

Participants (n = 80, aged 10.3 ± 2.5 years) presenting to the Hand Clinic of a tertiary Children's Hospital in Sydney, Australia, were randomly allocated into a Current Protocol and a New Protocol group. Following were the inclusion criteria: aged between 5 and 16 years; present with an non-displaced or minimally displaced and stable fracture; no surgical intervention; assessed as clinically healed at 3-week visit. The primary outcome measure was total active motion (TAM) of the injured digit compared with the contralateral digit (deg), at 5 weeks post injury. Secondary outcome measures were grip strength, and a parent-reported questionnaire. Statistical analysis used χ² test and the absolute difference described by a 90% CI. The New Protocol was considered noninferior if the 90% CI overlap was > 20% of the Current Protocol. Analysis was by intention to treat.

Results

There was a 10% loss to follow up at 5 weeks (Current Protocol = 4, New Protocol = 4). All CIs between groups overlapped by > 10%. TAM 90% CI for Current Protocol was 17.7 to 5.4 degrees and for the New Protocol was 4.7 to 1.6 degrees.

Conclusions

A change in practice is warranted to cease immobilization for children with conservatively managed proximal phalangeal fractures who present as clinically healed at 3 weeks. Therapist assessment of fracture healing is an appropriate indicator for intervention and can be utilized in a therapist-led model of care.

### Buddy taping as a treatment option for salter-harris II and juxta-physeal fractures of the proximal and middle phalanx: a systematic review [^3cfb46ec]. Hand (2025). Medium credibility.

Salter-Harris II (SH2) proximal/middle phalanx fractures are common injuries in children and heal well with immobilization. We conducted a systematic review of nonsurgical treatments for SH2 proximal/middle phalanx fractures. The constructed search strategy used descriptors that included synonyms for "phalanx fracture", "proximal/middle phalanx", and "fracture treatment". All steps of the process were performed by 2 independent reviewers. Articles of any study design that included children treated for SH2 proximal/middle phalanx fractures were included. Results were analyzed for summary statistics and interobserver agreement. Findings were reported in keeping with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The initial search yielded 3511 studies. Five studies met the final criteria: 1 randomized controlled trial (RCT), 3 prospective studies, and 1 retrospective study. Three studies employed a combination of taping and splinting strategies. All fractures healed with no reported complications. At the final follow-up, all studies reported full or nearly full range of motion and high rates of patient comfort and satisfaction. The RCT found lower rates of secondary displacement in the taping (6%) versus splinting (23%) group. Due to small sample sizes and heterogeneous study designs, conclusive recommendations cannot be drawn. More research is needed to determine the feasibility, compliance, safety, and effectiveness of taping these injuries.

### Current trends in the management of proximal interphalangeal joint injuries of the hand [^2960fcb1]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Injuries to the proximal interphalangeal joint are commonly encountered by the hand surgeon. Proper diagnosis and treatment are vital for optimal outcomes. Proper treatment of these injuries requires a working knowledge of the anatomy of the joint and an appreciation for principles for reduction, stabilization, and early rehabilitation to provide the best outcomes possible. Injuries can include fractures of the head of the proximal phalanx, dislocations, fracture dislocations, and fractures of the base of the middle phalanx. Similar to other aspects of plastic surgery, there is little high-level evidence guiding treatment and thus most treatment is based on level III or IV evidence. The goal for treatment of any injury around the proximal interphalangeal joint is to establish a congruent joint and allow for early motion. Stiffness and posttraumatic arthritis are common following these injuries. Salvage procedures are limited to arthrodesis and arthroplasty, neither of which can restore the normal function of the hand.

### Fingertip injuries [^f4acf375]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Distal phalanx fracture — etiology, imaging, treatment range, and antibiotics: "Fractures of the distal phalanx typically result from direct trauma such as crush injuries or an axial force to the fingertip". "Radiography is the initial imaging mode of choice. Anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique views show the fracture pattern and alignment". Treatment "ranges from stabilization in a composite aluminum and foam splint for 3 to 4 weeks to surgical intervention with open reduction and internal fixation for more complex (e.g., notable angulation or displacement) or open fractures". Additionally, "a systematic review failed to show that prophylactic antibiotics prevent the development of superficial infections or osteomyelitis after distal phalanx fractures".

### Pediatric phalanx fractures: unique challenges and pitfalls [^c870e806]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The hand is the most frequently injured part of the body in children. Most pediatric hand fractures can be treated by nonoperative means with good results. However, a subset of fractures requires prompt recognition and surgical intervention. We will review several pediatric phalangeal fracture types that must be recognized and treated appropriately to minimize complications and disability. These injuries defy the general conception that pediatric fractures universally do well with minimal intervention. This paper highlights two important concepts: (1) phalangeal fractures in children can differ considerably from other pediatric fractures, and (2) phalangeal fractures in children can be very different from those in adults. Tolerance of displacement may be small in juxtaarticular or intraarticular fractures and healing is rapid in phalangeal fractures, allowing displaced fractures to develop into malunions in a short period of time, with resultant deformity and dysfunction. Careful clinical examination of any suspected phalanx fracture in children is essential to appropriate treatment of these potentially problematic injuries, including adequate radiographic evaluation with multiple views of the suspected fracture site and thorough examination of possible open injuries.

### Fractures of the proximal interphalangeal joint [^d07df77a]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2000). Low credibility.

Fractures of the proximal interphalangeal joint constitute a broad spectrum of injuries. An understanding of the anatomy, the potential for joint instability, and the treatment options is essential to management of these fractures. Commonly observed fracture patterns involve one or both condyles of the proximal phalanx or the base of the middle phalanx. Fractures of the middle phalanx may involve the palmar lip or the dorsal lip or may be a "pilon" type of injury involving both the palmar and the dorsal lip with extensive intra-articular comminution. Intra-articular injuries may lead to joint subluxation or dislocation and must be identified in a timely manner to limit loss of motion, degenerative changes, and impaired function. These injuries range from those requiring minimal intervention to obtain an excellent outcome to those that are challenging to the most experienced surgeon. The treatment options include extension-block splinting, percutaneous pinning, traction, external fixation, open reduction and internal fixation, and volar-plate arthroplasty. Prompt recognition of the complexity of the injury and appropriate management are essential for an optimal functional outcome.

### Intramedullary screw fixation of proximal phalangeal fractures: short-to medium-term outcomes [^eac26913]. Hand (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hand fractures are common and account for up to a third of all fractures presenting to emergency departments, with phalangeal fractures occurring more commonly than those involving the metacarpals. - Injury to the proximal phalanx comprises 39% of all phalangeal fractures and poses a significant financial and health burden to both the individual and the community. - Thus, optimal management is key.

The treatment objective once the proximal phalanx is fractured is to ensure sufficient stability in a satisfactorily reduced position to allow early mobilization, thus preventing the formation of adhesions that may limit range of motion and function. Many of these fractures are stable and can be treated nonoperatively. However, fracture pattern and mechanism, as well as patient characteristics and functional requirements, may necessitate surgical intervention. Rigid fixation constructs are generally preferred to nonrigid fixation, as they facilitate precise alignment and earlier mobilization. However, stable fixation is only one determinant of outcome, with invasiveness, degree of soft tissue dissection, and cost also important considerations.

Intramedullary screw fixation of phalangeal and metacarpal fractures has gained popularity as a method of providing rigid internal fixation with minimum tendon disturbance, allowing early mobilization and rehabilitation, with novel methods of instrumentation broadening the indications. Screws may be inserted via retrograde intra-articular, antegrade intra-articular, and antegrade transarticular routes, with choice determined via fracture pattern, patient characteristics, and surgical preference.

Despite the increasing popularity and adoption of the use of intramedullary screw fixation, the literature on outcomes using this technique is limited. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the short-term to medium-term outcomes of intramedullary screw fixation for proximal phalangeal fracture fixation in an Australian setting.

### Adequate union rates for the treatment of acute proximal fifth metatarsal fractures [^07ae8705]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The most notable finding of this study was that union rates for tuberosity avulsion fractures were found to be independent of both initial treatment choice and degree of fracture displacement. Non-displaced zone 1 fractures demonstrated particularly uncomplicated union rates following non-operative management. Outcome analysis of displaced zone 1 fractures, however, also demonstrated similar union rates for surgical and conservative treatment, albeit with a more limited dataset. In contradistinction, both higher union rates and faster times to union were found following the surgical management of zone 2 fractures when compared to conservative treatment methods. Acute proximal diaphyseal (zone 3) fractures appear to be a rare occurrence in the literature, and therefore an optimized treatment algorithm cannot be determined at this time.

### Pediatric phalanx fractures [^8e869d64]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2016). Low credibility.

Phalangeal fractures are the most common type of hand fracture that occurs in the pediatric population and account for the second highest number of emergency department visits for fractures in the United States. The incidence of phalangeal fractures is the highest in children aged 10 to 14 years, which coincides with the time that most children begin playing contact sports. Younger children are more likely to sustain a phalangeal fracture in the home setting as a result of crush and laceration injuries. Salter-Harris type II fractures of the proximal phalanx are the most common type of finger fracture. An unmineralized physis is biomechanically weaker compared with the surrounding ligamentous structures and mature bone, which makes fractures about the physis likely. A thorough physical examination is necessary to assess the digital cascade for signs of rotational deformity and/or coronal malalignment. Plain radiographs of the hand and digits are sufficient to confirm a diagnosis of a phalangeal fracture. The management of phalangeal fractures is based on the initial severity of the injury and depends on the success of closed reduction techniques. Nondisplaced phalanx fractures are managed with splint immobilization. Stable, reduced phalanx fractures are immobilized but require close monitoring to ensure maintenance of fracture reduction. Unstable, displaced phalanx fractures require surgical management, preferably via closed reduction and percutaneous pinning.

### Choosing the proper implant for extra-articular fractures of proximal phalanges: a study on 75 cases [^46654853]. Injury (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Phalangeal fractures are the most common fractures of the hand and in particular the proximal phalanx of the long fingers is the most involved. These fractures can ben conservatively managed but, when the fracture pattern is considered unstable, surgical treatment is recommended. However, there is no consensus in literature about the proper surgical option for extra-articular proximal phalanx fractures.

Material and Methods

We compared clinical and radiographical results after treatment of 75 cases of extra-articular proximal phalanx fractures using three different surgical techniques: closed reduction and internal fixation (CRIF) with Kirschner wires (G1 group), open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) with plates and screws or lag screws (G2 group), and closed reduction and intramedullary screw fixation (CRIMEF)(G3 group).

Results

We found no significant differences in term of union rate and time to fracture healing between the three groups. However, we found a significant reduction in time to return at work and in TAM at the final follow-up examination in G3 group (treated with CRIMEF) when compared with both G1 and G2. No differences in complications rate were found between three groups.

Discussion

The surgical variability in the management of extra-articular phalanx fractures create lacks on standard guide for treatment.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our results showed good clinical and radiographical results with all the three surgical options. However, the closed reduction and internal fixation with intramedullary screws (CRIMEF) seems to be better in terms of time to return to work and TAM at the final follow-up, probably due to good primary stability and little risk of soft tissue adherence development.

### Diagnosis and management of common foot fractures [^f15fffb2]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Foot fractures are among the most common foot injuries evaluated by primary care physicians. They most often involve the metatarsals and toes. Patients typically present with varying signs and symptoms, the most common being pain and trouble with ambulation. Diagnosis requires radiographic evaluation, although emerging evidence demonstrates that ultrasonography may be just as accurate. Management is determined by the location of the fracture and its effect on balance and weight bearing. Metatarsal shaft fractures are initially treated with a posterior splint and avoidance of weight-bearing activities; subsequent treatment consists of a short leg walking cast or boot for four to six weeks. Proximal fifth metatarsal fractures have different treatments depending on the location of the fracture. A fifth metatarsal tuberosity avulsion fracture can be treated acutely with a compressive dressing, then the patient can be transitioned to a short leg walking boot for two weeks, with progressive mobility as tolerated after initial immobilization. A Jones fracture has a higher risk of nonunion and requires at least six to eight weeks in a short leg non-weight-bearing cast; healing time can be as long as 10 to 12 weeks. Great toe fractures are treated with a short leg walking boot or cast with toe plate for two to three weeks, then a rigid-sole shoe for an additional three to four weeks. Lesser toe fractures can be treated with buddy taping and a rigid-sole shoe for four to six weeks.

### Hand fractures: indications, the tried and true and new innovations [^d632237d]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Hand fractures are the second most common fracture of the upper extremity, and management of patients with these injuries is common for most hand surgery practices. In this article, we outline the principles of management of these injuries with a special focus on those that are common or complex. We also highlight recent innovations in the context of these injuries. From this cross-section of contemporary evidence on phalangeal and metacarpal fracture treatment, we have noted a trend toward minimally invasive surgery with immediate postoperative mobilization, the use of wide-awake anesthesia, as well as sustained investigation and innovation in the biomechanics and treatment of proximal interphalangeal joint fracture dislocations.

### Old principles revisited – traction splinting for closed proximal phalangeal fractures [^9067cefb]. Injury (2002). Low credibility.

Proximal phalangeal fractures are commonly caused by a blunt injury to the dorsum of the hand. This typically results in a closed transverse fracture with volar angulation, which is an inherently unstable fracture pattern. K-wiring and internal fixation have the disadvantage of damage to the soft tissue envelope, risk of infection and wire loosening. We describe 15 patients treated with an alternative method of skin traction and splintage in our regional trauma centre. Fractures were reduced under X-ray and reduction was maintained using a combination of a malleable metal splint and tape to provide skin traction. Fourteen patients had an excellent objective and subjective outcome. The advantage of our technique is preservation of the soft tissue envelope and it should be considered an alternative to other treatment options as it is simple, quick, inexpensive and non-invasive.

### Current concepts in treatment of fracture-dislocations of the proximal interphalangeal joint [^ba7f0dea]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Proximal interphalangeal joint fracture-dislocations are common injuries that require expedient and attentive treatment for the best outcomes. Management can range from protective splinting and early mobilization to complex surgery. In this review, the current concepts surrounding the management of these injuries are reviewed.

Methods

A literature review was performed of all recent articles pertaining to proximal interphalangeal joint fracture-dislocation, with specific focus on middle phalangeal base fractures. Where appropriate, older articles or articles on closely related injury types were included for completeness. The methodology and outcomes of each study were analyzed.

Results

When small avulsion fractures are present, good results are routinely obtained with reduction and early mobilization of stable injuries. Strategies for management of the unstable dorsal fracture-dislocation have evolved over time. To provide early stability, a variety of techniques have evolved, including closed, percutaneous, external, and internal fixation methods. Although each of these techniques can be successful in skilled hands, none has been subjected to rigorous, prospective, comparative trials. Volar dislocations fare less well, with significant loss of motion in many studies. Pilon fractures represent the most complicated injuries, and return of normal motion is not expected.

Conclusions

The best outcomes can be achieved by (1) establishing enough stability to allow early motion, (2) restoring gliding joint motion rather than noncongruent motion, and (3) restoring the articular surface congruity when possible. Although the majority of literature on this topic consists of expert opinion and retrospective case series, the consensus appears to favor less invasive techniques whenever possible.

### Nonarticular base and shaft fractures of children's fingers: are follow-up X-rays needed? Retrospective study of conservatively treated proximal and middle phalangeal fractures [^d4fb4e01]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Phalangeal fractures of the hand are common in children, and most extra-articular fractures can be treated with nonoperative management. Minimally or nondisplaced fractures may simply be immobilized, whereas displaced fractures need closed reduction before immobilization. Although few of these fractures displace secondarily, most schemes currently recommend follow-up x-rays after initial diagnosis. Our primary objective was to identify subgroups of finger fractures that are stable, thus requiring no radiographic monitoring.

Methods

This study was designed as a retrospective, single-center analysis of conservatively treated pediatric finger fractures of the proximal and middle phalanges. We included patients up to 16 years with base or shaft fractures of the index to little fingers who underwent nonoperative treatment and standardized follow-up controls in our pediatric hand surgery outpatients' clinic between 2010 and 2016. Fracture angular deformity in x-rays taken at diagnosis and after 1 and 3 weeks were reassessed blinded, and a statistical analysis was conducted to identify fracture types that are prone to secondary angular deformity.

Results

A total of 478 patients were eligible; 113 were lost due to missing final radiographic controls. Overall, 365 patients were analyzed; they had a mean age of 9.7 years (range, 1 to 16), and 33.4% required a primary closed reduction. A secondary angular deformity occurred in 2.2% (8/365) of all finger fractures. No secondary angulation occurred in primary minimally and nondisplaced fractures, but 6.6% (8/122) of the reduced fractures showed a subsequent loss of reduction.

Conclusions

Minimally angulated (< 10 degrees) and nondisplaced metaphyseal and diaphyseal fractures of proximal and middle phalanges of the index to little fingers are stable and therefore do not need radiographic follow-ups. However, initially angulated fractures requiring closed reduction bear a risk of subsequent loss of reduction.

### Adequate union rates for the treatment of acute proximal fifth metatarsal fractures [^3dc6bc82]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute fractures of the proximal fifth metatarsal are a common injury of the foot. Currently, the choice between surgical or conservative treatment of these fractures is primarily based on anatomical location and degree of fracture displacement. Fractures of the proximal fifth metatarsal have been subdivided into three regions, as described by Lawrence and Botte: tuberosity avulsion fractures (zone 1), Jones' fractures (zone 2) and, proximal diaphyseal fractures (zone 3). Even though controversy persists, the current trend in orthopaedic care has been to treat non-displaced zone 1 fractures primarily conservatively, to treat significantly displaced zone 1 fractures surgically, and to treat zone 2 and 3 fractures either conservatively or surgically depending on overall patient expectation and activity level. The first aim of this review was therefore to assess available literature to determine the bone healing outcomes following both surgical and conservative treatment of each anatomical zone of acute proximal fifth metatarsal fractures. A secondary aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and return to activity related outcomes of each treatment strategy. The clinical utility of this work is aimed at providing better guidance for clinicians and patients during the shared decision making process.

### Adequate union rates for the treatment of acute proximal fifth metatarsal fractures [^53d00121]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To compare the bone healing, clinical, and return to daily activity outcomes after either surgical or conservative management of acute zone 1, 2, and 3 fifth metatarsal fractures.

Methods

A literature search was performed to identify studies published from the earliest record to January 2019 using EMBASE (Ovid), MEDLINE via PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science. All articles assessing clinical outcomes of acute proximal fifth metatarsal fractures were included. Bone healing and clinical outcomes were thereafter calculated using a simplified pooling method.

Results

Thirty-two articles comprising of a total of 1,239 fractures were included, of which one was a randomized controlled trial, seven were prospective studies, and 24 were retrospective studies. 627 zone 1 fractures demonstrated union rates of 93.2% following conservative treatment and 95.1% following surgical treatment. Conservatively managed zone 1 fractures were displaced 49.5% of the time, compared to a rate of 92.8% for the surgically treated cases. For Jones' (zone 2) fractures, bone healing outcomes of conservative versus surgical treatment showed union rates of 77.4% versus 96.3%, refracture rates of 2.4% versus 2.1%, and mean time to union of 11.0 weeks versus 9.4 weeks, respectively. Only ten proximal diaphyseal (zone 3) fractures were reported, with a mean return to work of 8.2 weeks.

Conclusion

Acute zone 1 fractures are preferably treated conservatively as similar union rates were found after both conservative and surgical management. In contradistinction, acute zone 2 fractures demonstrate higher union rates and faster time to union when treated surgically. The outcomes of acute zone 3 fractures are rarely reported in the literature, so treatment recommendations remain unclear. Further research of proximal fifth metatarsal fractures is warranted to provide more definitive conclusions, but current findings can aid surgeons during the shared clinical decision making process.

### Intramedullary screw fixation of proximal phalangeal fractures: short-to medium-term outcomes [^647110b3]. Hand (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

This study was performed as a retrospective review of a series of consecutive patients with proximal phalangeal fractures stabilized by intramedullary screws by 2 fellowship-trained orthopedic hand surgeons in Sydney and the Gold Coast, Australia. The intramedullary screws were inserted via either antegrade or retrograde routes. Following provisional fracture reduction, a guidewire was inserted through the proximal interphalangeal joint (for retrograde insertion), or through the metacarpal head or the metacarpophalangeal joint (for antegrade intra-articular and antegrade transarticular insertion, respectively). For extremely basal fractures, the technique of reverse instrumentation and stabilization of the fracture followed by antegrade intra-articular insertion, as described by Sivakumar and Graham, was used. A small skin incision was then performed, and screw length measured. The diameter of the screw was determined by the phalangeal anatomy, aiming for an isthmic fit — in the vast majority of patients, a 2.2-mm cannulated compression screw (Medartis AG, Basel, Switzerland) was used. The screw was inserted with care taken to hold the digits in relaxed flexion, to maintain a normal cascade and prevent any malrotation. Patients commenced active range of motion within 1 week of the operation, with buddy strapping to the adjacent digits to control rotation, within a hand-based thermoplastic splint. Radiographs were taken at a standardized timepoint of 6 weeks after the operation, with a return to normal activities in a graded fashion if union or progression to union was noted.

### Intramedullary screw fixation of proximal phalangeal fractures: short-to medium-term outcomes [^9d10ec68]. Hand (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Proximal phalangeal fractures are common, posing significant health and financial burdens to individuals and the community. - Thus, optimal management is key. Recently, operative intervention for hand fractures has increased, with Kirschner wire (K-wire) and plate fixation traditionally being the main operative modalities.

Kirschner wire fixation is rapid and cost-effective, requiring minimal soft tissue dissection. However, it often yields decreased construct rigidity and rotational control, and lacks compression at the fracture site. Protruding wires may cause pin site infections; those buried require another operation for removal. These limitations necessitate immobilization prior to rehabilitation, which when combined with potential extensor apparatus tethering on insertion, can cause significant stiffness.

Biomechanical studies and operative trends indicate that rigid fixation constructs such as plates are favorable to nonrigid alternatives. - However, technique invasiveness and soft tissue damage also influence outcomes. Although newer generation plating systems are of lower profile, limited cross-sectional area available for implant placement (due to the intimate relationship between soft tissue and bone in the proximal phalanx), and degree of soft tissue dissection required in the traditional dorsal tendon splitting approach, often causes increased scarring and diminished TAM. Various approaches and plate positions have been suggested to minimize invasiveness and extensor tendon impediment, with a meta-analysis by Sivakumar finding that tendon-sparing approaches resulted in significantly greater TAM (8.5°; 95% confidence interval, 0.8–16.4, P = 0.03) than a tendon-splitting approach.

### Intramedullary compression screw fixation of proximal phalanx fractures: an updated systematic review [^7e73f937]. Hand (2025). Medium credibility.

Proximal phalangeal fractures occur at a higher frequency than other phalanges, but the optimal management of these injuries remains subject to debate. The use of intramedullary screw (IMS) fixation has gained popularity over the last decade and aims to minimize extensor apparatus violation whilst providing adequate construct stability to allow early motion and rehabilitation. This systematic review aims to provide an updated analysis of patient- and clinician-reported outcome measures following fracture fixation using IMS in the proximal phalanx. A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Ovid Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials, yielding 16 studies with 204 fractures for inclusion. A mean total active motion of 237°, Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (Quick-DASH) score of 3.58, and DASH score of 2.65 was revealed by pooled analysis of the included studies. A total complication rate of 6.4% was reported, including screw prominence, fracture displacement, infection, and flexion contracture. This updated systematic review finds good functional outcomes and a low complication rate following the use of IMS fixation for proximal phalangeal fractures.

### Principles of metacarpal and phalangeal fracture management: a review of rehabilitation concepts [^c166cdf4]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

Patients with common hand fractures are likely to present in a wide variety of outpatient orthopedic practices. Successful rehabilitation of hand fractures addresses the need to (1) maintain fracture stability for bone healing, (2) introduce soft tissue mobilization for soft tissue integrity, and (3) remodel any restrictive scar from injury or surgery. It is important to recognize the intimate relationship of these 3 tissues (bone, soft tissue, and scar) when treating hand fractures. Fracture terminology precisely defines fracture type, location, and management strategy for hand fractures. These terms are reviewed, with emphasis on their operational definitions, as they relate to the course of therapy. The progression of motion protocols is dependent on the type of fracture healing, either primary or secondary, which in turn is determined by the method of fracture fixation. Current closed- and open-fixation methods for metacarpal and phalangeal fractures are addressed for each fracture location. The potential soft tissue problems that are often associated with each type of fracture are explained, with preventative methods of splinting and treatment. A comprehensive literature review is provided to compare evidence for practice in managing the variety of fracture patterns associated with metacarpal and phalangeal fractures, following closed- and open-fixation techniques. Emphasis is placed on initial hand positioning to protect the fracture reduction, exercise to maintain or regain joint range of motion, and specific tendon-gliding exercises to prevent restrictive adhesions, all of which are necessary to assure return of function post fracture.

### Malalignment in intramedullary nailing. how to achieve and to maintain correct reduction? [^48893dbf]. Injury (2017). Low credibility.

Intramedullary nailing has become the standard for the treatment of long bones diaphyseal fractures. Modern techniques of locking have further enlarged the primary indications to more proximal and distal fractures relying upon a former correct alignment. Nevertheless, residual deformities are not rare as once the nail has left the narrow diaphyseal canal and comes into the wider metaphysis, it may follow an unwished trajectory. There is also a chance for malreduction in diapyhseal fractures. The more complex the fracture is, the more difficult its reduction, not only for the alignment of the proximal or the distal part of bone in relation to the diaphysis, but also correct rotation and length. In this paper, we analyze recommended techniques to achieve accurate bone fracture reduction, to avoid post-operative deformities combined with correct implant insertion.

### Common foot fractures [^4de6b5db]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Foot fractures account for about one-third of lower extremity fractures in adults. They are typically caused by a crush injury or an axial or twisting force on the foot. Patients usually present with bony point tenderness and swelling of the affected area. Weight-bearing varies based on the extent of the fracture and the patient's pain tolerance. When a foot or toe fracture is suspected, anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique radiography with weight-bearing should be obtained. The Ottawa foot and ankle rules can help determine the need for radiography after an acute ankle inversion injury. Many foot fractures can be managed with a short leg cast or boot or a hard-soled shoe. Weight-bearing and duration of immobilization are based on the stability of the fracture and the patient's pain level. Most toe fractures can be managed nonsurgically with a hard-soled shoe for two to six weeks. Close attention should be paid to the great toe because of its role in weight-bearing, and physicians should follow specific guidelines for orthopedic referral. Meta-tarsal shaft fractures are managed with a boot or hard-soled shoe for three to six weeks. The proximal aspect of the fifth metatarsal has varied rates of healing due to poor blood supply, and management is based on the fracture zone. Lis-franc fractures are often overlooked; radiography with weight-bearing should be obtained, and physicians should look for widening of the tarsometatarsal joint. Other tarsal bone fractures can be managed with a short leg cast or boot for four to six weeks when nonsurgical treatment is indicated. Common foot fracture complications include arthritis, infection, malunion or nonunion, and compartment syndrome.

### Intramedullary screw fixation of proximal phalangeal fractures: short-to medium-term outcomes [^a3f64141]. Hand (2025). Medium credibility.

Recently, intramedullary screw fixation has been advocated to address concerns of tendon disturbance minimization while providing sufficient stability to facilitate early mobilization. Intramedullary screws can be inserted via retrograde (through a flexed proximal interphalangeal joint into the head of the proximal phalanx); intra-articular antegrade (where the proximal phalanx base is subluxated at the metacarpophalangeal joint to facilitate direct entry); and transarticular (where the screw is inserted through the metacarpal head into the base of the proximal phalanx) routes.

Various biomechanical and cadaveric studies have alleviated concerns surrounding this technique. Ibanez found that intramedullary screw fixation provides greater construct stability and load to failure than lateral plating. Vegas found that insertion of 2.8-mm screws via retrograde insertion damaged 6.2% of the articular surface of the head of cadaveric proximal phalanges, while a 4.1-mm screw affected 13.4%. Retrograde insertion also preserved the central slip, with the tendon lesion an average of 2.7 mm wide and 4.9 mm proximal to its insertion unto the middle phalanx.

del Piñal assessed articular surface involvement following retrograde insertion, finding that the smallest joints had less than 18% and 25% damage with 2.5- and 3.0-mm screws, respectively. Proximal articular surface lesions of the proximal phalanx (via antegrade techniques) are markedly smaller, with Borbas reporting 4.5% and 8.5% disruption when using a 2.2- or 3.0-mm screw, respectively. Notably, the screws used in these studies are of relatively large diameter, while this study routinely used 2.2-mm cannulated screws.

Stern warned that the "push-up" technique for antegrade intra-articular screw insertion is technically challenging, as dorsal translation usually occurs at the fracture site and not through the joint. Sivakumar recommended retrograde K-wire insertion and fracture stabilization through the proximal interphalangeal joint, prior to dorsal translation, followed by antegrade intramedullary screw insertion. This facilitates screw stabilization of fairly proximal fractures without the need for transarticular insertion, broadening the indications for use of intramedullary screws.

### Metacarpal fractures: treatment and complications [^2f92d07b]. Hand (2014). Low credibility.

Metacarpal fractures comprise between 18–44% of all hand fractures. Non-thumb metacarpals account for around 88% of all metacarpal fractures, with the fifth finger most commonly involved [19]. The majority of metacarpal fractures are isolated injuries, which are simple, closed, and stable. While many metacarpal fractures do well without surgery, there is a paucity of literature and persistent controversy to guide the treating physician on the best treatment algorithm. The purpose of this article is to review non-thumb metacarpal anatomy and treatment protocols for nonoperative management of stable fractures, and compare existing literature on surgical techniques for treatment of acute fractures and complications.

### A systematic review of treatment interventions for metacarpal shaft fractures in adults [^98dc0674]. Hand (2022). Medium credibility.

Metacarpal shaft fractures are common hand injuries that predominantly affect younger patients. There is wide variability in their treatment with no consensus on best practice. We performed a systematic review to assess the breadth and quality of available evidence supporting different treatment modalities for metacarpal shaft fractures of the finger digits in adults. A comprehensive search was conducted across multiple databases, in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A total of 1600 records were identified; 7 studies fulfilled eligibility criteria and were included. No randomized controlled trials directly comparing surgery with nonsurgical treatment were found. One retrospective study compared nonsurgical with surgical treatment, whereas 6 compared surgical or nonsurgical treatments. Considerable heterogeneity between studies along with a high or critical risk of bias restricts direct comparison and conclusions. There is a lack of high-quality evidence to guide treatment, supporting the need for well-designed, multicenter trials to identify the most effective and cost-efficient treatment for metacarpal shaft fractures in adults.

### Adequate union rates for the treatment of acute proximal fifth metatarsal fractures [^407af695]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Methodological considerations

The outcomes of this systematic review must be interpreted within the context of its design. First, few high-level articles were included in this study as was shown by the low MINORS score of the body of included articles. Therefore, interpretation of the results in the present systematic review must be done with caution. Additionally, only one zone 1 study, and three zone 2 studies directly compared surgery with conservative therapy, making a formal statistical comparison by meta-analysis methodologically unfit. A simplified pooling technique was therefore used, allowing a large body of articles to be included which could introduce bias as a result of including varying study designs and patients populations. Performing a comparative synthesis for the present study was deliberately avoided because treatment indications for these fractures differed within this body of literature. Therefore, it should be noted that the clinical outcomes of this study have to be interpreted with caution and should not be used for treatment decisions for individual patients.

Second, this review only included acute fractures of the proximal fifth metatarsal, as stress fractures have an inherent tendency for impaired healing. There seems, however, to be no uniform definition that clearly stratifies acute- from stress fractures. This might have had an effect on the results of this study as it might have been possible that patients that actually had a stress fracture were included in this systematic review, thus biasing results.

Indications for fixation (non-geriatric patients) — Moderate evidence supports that for non-geriatric patients (most commonly defined in studies as under 65 years of age), operative treatment for fractures with post reduction radial shortening > 3mm, dorsal tilt > 10 degrees, or intraarticular displacement or step off > 2 mm leads to improved radiographic and patient reported outcomes. Strength of Recommendation: Moderate.

### High union rates following surgical treatment of proximal fifth metatarsal stress fractures [^a609b006]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical implications and future perspectives

Using the currently available evidence, surgical treatment results in a high union rate for proximal MT5 stress fractures and may be considered as the optimal treatment. The present study highlights the healing complications seen after non-surgical treatment as well as the scarcity of data on the result of non-surgical treatment. The findings of the present study can aid physicians in determining the best treatment strategy for patients with a proximal MT5 stress fracture. Additionally, these findings can help physicians in the shared decision-making process with patients, and in the expectation management for return to sports and possible union complications after such a fracture.

Future research should focus on reporting prospectively gathered clinical and union outcomes for surgical and non-surgical treatment modalities and should further investigate the factors associated with union complications and the failure of non-surgical treatment. The additional use of blood products such as bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) could enhance the fracture healing and return to sports and could be a promising adjuvant therapy.

### BET 1: functional treatment is non-inferior to below the knee cast in adults with acute closed proximal fifth metatarsal fractures [^a3749e2e]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

A short cut review was carried out to establish whether functional treatment is better than conservative treatment with a below knee cast at decreasing time to functional recovery and fracture union in adults with an acute closed proximal fifth metatarsal fracture. Four papers presented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study weaknesses of these papers are tabulated. It is concluded that in proximal (zone 1 and 2) fractures of the fifth metatarsal functional treatment with immediate mobilisation is at least non-inferior to immobilisation in a cast.

Defining the strength of the recommendations — judging the strength of evidence is only a steppingstone towards arriving at the strength of a systematic literature review recommendation. The strength of recommendation also takes into account the quality, quantity, and the trade-off between the benefits and harms of a treatment, the magnitude of a treatment's effect, and whether there is data on critical outcomes. The recommendations and their strength were voted on by the guideline development group members during the final meeting, and recommendations were approved and adopted in instances where a simple majority (60%) of the guideline development group voted to approve.

### Intramedullary screw fixation of proximal phalangeal fractures: short-to medium-term outcomes [^611aceb0]. Hand (2025). Medium credibility.

Sivakumar further assessed practice variation in proximal phalangeal fracture management by surveying members of the Australian Hand Surgery Society, finding that clinician experience, base specialty training, practice location, and practice volume affected decision-making. Orthopedic surgeons and less experienced surgeons were more likely to feel comfortable with, and attempt, intramedullary screw fixation.

This study has several limitations, including its retrospective nature, small sample size, and reliance on the initial documentation accuracy to assess demographic, injury, and surgical data. Operations from multiple surgeons, across the surgical learning curve, with varying methods of screw insertion, lead to potential confounding. Total active motion was not compared with the normal contralateral side, nor was grip strength measured. Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand, although allowing comparison with other studies, may be affected by hand dominance. Postoperative rehabilitation protocols were not detailed and may have varied between patients.

However, this study concurs with the prior literature that intramedullary screw fixation is a safe and effective method of stabilizing extra-articular proximal phalangeal fractures in the short to medium term, due to excellent clinical outcomes, and cost-effectiveness and time-effectiveness. Further long-term studies, and randomized controlled trials, are required.

### High union rates following surgical treatment of proximal fifth metatarsal stress fractures [^be30fe8b]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Fracture healing

The present study shows that surgical treatment of proximal MT5 fractures results in lower rates of adverse bone healing events (i.e. delayed union, non-union and refracture rates) when compared to non-surgical treatment. A systematic review by Mallee et al. concerning stress fractures in high-risk regions of the lower leg similarly found fewer adverse healing events and a shorter return to sport time after surgical treatment of proximal MT5 stress fractures. The disparity in union rates between surgically and non-surgically treated fractures may be due to the prolonged fracture healing that is observed in stress fractures. Proximal MT5 fractures tend to show poor healing due to the limited blood supply and high load during sports with repetitive (micro)trauma. Non-surgical treatment may, therefore, be unable to adequately stabilize these types of fractures that are frequently seen in physically active patient populations. Surgical treatment may address this problem by providing an immediate stable fracture reduction which could allow for better callus formation and, therefore, superior healing. As a result, patients are able to return to (full) weight-bearing and sporting activities at a faster rate. The trend towards increased surgical fixation for the management of these difficult fractures is clear in the literature. It must be stated, however, that the preference of surgical fixation over non-surgical treatment may lead to (publication) bias towards surgical treatment. Moreover, the results reported for surgically treated cases are often from (high-level) athletic patients, which may introduce selection bias. The available clinical results for non-surgical treatment are very limited in comparison with surgical interventions. Although surgery provides better union outcomes, non-surgical therapy can still offer satisfying union outcomes and should always be considered in fracture treatment and patients with increased risk for surgical complications. It must also be pointed out that no formal statistical comparison between treatment modalities was made in the present study due to methodological considerations. Further research on both treatment modalities — non-surgical treatment in particular — is, therefore, necessary to provide more valid evidence for the superior treatment of MT5 stress fractures.

### Fractures of the fifth metatarsal; diagnosis and treatment [^8fb41e94]. Injury (2010). Low credibility.

Of all foot fractures the fifth metatarsal fracture is the most common. A complete clinical and radiological assessment is required to select the best treatment option. Nondisplaced tuberosity avulsion fractures can be treated non-operatively. Surgical treatment is indicated when the fracture is displaced more than 2mm or when more than 30% of the cubometatarsal joint is involved. Non or minimally displaced shaft fractures can be treated non-operatively. If the dislocation is more than 3-4mm or the angulation is more than 10 degrees, percutaneous K-wires, plate or screw fixation is indicated. The Jones fracture is known for prolonged healing time and non-union. The indication for surgical treatment of Jones' fractures depends on activity level and Torg classification: type I fractures are treated non-operatively. Type II fractures can be treated non-operatively or operatively, depending on patient activity level. Type III fractures have more complications and should be treated operatively. Several operation techniques have been described.

### A comparison of casting versus splinting for nonoperative treatment of pediatric phalangeal neck fractures [^8c1eed48]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Phalangeal neck fractures account for 13% of pediatric finger fractures. Al Qattan type I (undisplaced) fractures are treated nonoperatively. There is increasing evidence that Type 2 (displaced) fractures achieve remarkable fracture remodeling with nonoperative treatment and patients frequently make a full functional recovery. The options available for nonoperative management of these fractures are either a plaster cast or a removable splint. We hypothesized that there would be no significant difference in radiologic outcome in pediatric phalangeal neck fractures (Types I and II) treated with splint or cast immobilization.

Methods

This is a retrospective study of patients aged 18 and below with phalangeal neck fractures treated nonoperatively from 2008 to 2017. Radiographs were compared at < 1 week and > 3 weeks after injury. Translation and angulation in coronal and sagittal planes were measured and compared using Student t tests. Baseline variables were compared using χ² or Fisher exact tests.

Results

There were 47 patients with phalangeal neck fractures treated nonoperatively during the study period. There were 9 type I and 38 type II fractures. The mean age was 10 years with 40 males and 7 females. Fractures occurred in 33 dominant and 14 nondominant hands and involved 29 proximal and 18 middle phalanges. Nineteen children were treated in casts and 28 with removable splints. The mean duration of follow-up was similar between the 2 groups. The most affected phalanx was the proximal phalanx of the small finger and the most common fracture pattern was type IIA. There was no significant difference in clinical and radiologic outcomes between children who were treated in casts and those treated in removable splints.

Conclusion

There was no difference in the clinical and radiologic outcomes in pediatric phalangeal neck fractures treated with cast or splint immobilization. Splinting has the added benefits of increased comfort and hygiene and we routinely offer splinting as a viable alternative in the nonoperative treatment of Al Qattan type I and type II phalangeal fractures.

### Hand fractures and their management: an international view [^e6313889]. Injury (2006). Low credibility.

Fractures of the bones of the hand are among the commonest fractures in humans, but their management varies widely in the different regions of the world. This variability is due to many reasons, including availability of resources, social factors, geographic constraints, surgeon preference and experience, and local practice patterns. Developing countries are more likely to apply less expensive methods of managing hand fractures. The treatment of these injuries will fall somewhere along a continuum that parallels the historical development of hand fracture management. This paper will review the history of phalangeal and metacarpal fracture management to infer global differences in the treatment of hand fractures. An overview of how different health care systems are likely to manage these injuries will assist health care providers in choosing the most appropriate treatment method.

Learning Objectives

After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Understand the indications for metacarpal fixation. 2. Understand the rationale for various surgical treatment options, based on high-level evidence where available. 3. Describe selected operative techniques and their postoperative management.

Background

Metacarpal fractures are extremely common, constituting one in five fractures that present to the emergency department. Although many metacarpal fractures can be treated nonoperatively, some require surgery. The purpose of this CME article is to present a practical, up-to-date guide to the management of these common injuries.

Methods

A review of nonoperative management, surgical indications, and selected surgical techniques is provided. The authors reviewed the literature related to the treatment of metacarpal fractures, and the highest level evidence available to help guide decision-making is presented.

Conclusions

Metacarpal fractures can often be treated nonoperatively, although some fractures will benefit from surgical treatment. Although there is some high-level evidence to guide decision-making, there are many clinical scenarios for which there is little high-quality applicable research. As a general principle, the treatment option that achieves the desired reduction and degree of fixation, allows early motion, and minimizes soft-tissue injury should be preferred.

### Closed reduction percutaneous pinning versus open reduction with plate and screw fixation in management of unstable proximal phalangeal fractures: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^393cc05d]. Hand (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Proximal phalanx fractures are common, with surgical fixation indicated for unstable fractures. Traditionally, closed reduction percutaneous pinning (CRPP) resulted in decreased stiffness and tendon irritation compared to open reduction internal fixation (ORIF). We hypothesized that more recent studies would have more similar outcomes to CRPP. The purpose of this study was to compare CRPP and ORIF in terms of range of motion, Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) scores, and complications.

Methods

Four electronic databases were queried from 2010 to present. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, two independent reviewers performed a two-step review process to identify relevant articles. Patient demographics, total active motion (TAM), DASH, and complications were extracted. The methodological quality of each study included was assessed independently. Meta-analysis was performed for comparative trials.

Results

Fourteen studies met inclusion criteria including four comparative studies: Thirteen studies included TAM. The weighted average TAM was 228 ± 34° for CRPP and 223 ± 32° for ORIF (P = 0.07 with 95% confidence interval (CI), -0.5 to 10.5). Seven studies evaluated DASH scores; weighted average was 8.2 ± 8.9 for CRPP and 11.7 ± 6.5 for ORIF (P < .01 with 95% CI, 1.8–5.2). Two studies directly compared CRPP to ORIF, favoring ORIF for both TAM with d = 1.07 and DASH with d = 0.23. Rates of tenolysis or hardware removal were higher for ORIF (P < .01).

Conclusions

New literature suggests more equipoise with regard to treatment of proximal phalanx fracture with CRPP versus ORIF.

### Fractures of the proximal phalanx and metacarpals in the hand: preferred methods of stabilization [^df47de3e]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2008). Low credibility.

Treatment of fractures of the proximal phalanx and metacarpals is based on the presentation of the fracture, degree of displacement, and difficulty in maintaining fracture reduction. A wide array of treatment options exists for the variation in fracture patterns observed. Inherently stable fractures do not require surgical treatment; all other fractures should be considered for additional stabilization. In general, of the many combinations of internal fixation possible, Kirschner wires and screw-and-plate fixation predominate. Early closed reduction typically is successful for unicondylar fractures of the head of the proximal phalanx. Bicondylar proximal phalanx fractures usually are treated with plate fixation. Transverse and short oblique proximal phalanx fractures generally are treated with Kirschner wires, although a stable short oblique transverse shaft fracture can be managed with an intrinsic plus splint. Plate fixation is used in comminuted proximal phalanx as well as comminuted metacarpal fractures, and lag screws in spiral long oblique phalanx shaft fractures and metacarpal head fractures. Kirschner wire fixation is successful in metacarpal neck fractures as well as both short and long transverse oblique shaft fractures.

### Conservative treatment for closed fifth (small finger) metacarpal neck fractures [^e347972a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Subcapital fractures of the fifth metacarpal bone, meaning fractures just below the knuckle of the little finger, account for approximately 20% of all hand fractures. Currently, there is no consensus concerning the optimal management of these fractures. Traditionally, treatment consists of closed reduction and external splinting in a neutral position using plaster of Paris (POP), involving the metacarpal joint, the proximal interphalangeal joint and the carpo-metacarpal joint. An alternative treatment strategy is functional treatment using taping or bracing that does not restrict movement.

Objectives

To compare functional treatment with immobilization, and to compare different periods and types of immobilization, for the treatment of closed fifth metacarpal neck fractures in adults.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialized Register (July 2004), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2004), OVID OldMEDLINE (1951 to 1965), OVID MEDLINE (1966 to July 2004), OVID MEDLINE In-Process (July 2004), EMBASE (1988 to 2004, week 29), the Internet, and reference lists of articles. No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

All randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials which compare functional treatment with immobilization or different types of immobilization for closed fifth metacarpal neck fractures.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors assessed abstracts of all studies identified by the initial search, identified studies meeting the selection criteria, independently assessed the quality of the trial reports, and extracted and analysed the data.

Main Results

Five studies met the inclusion criteria including a total of 252 participants. Most studies were of poor quality. The primary outcome measure, function of the hand, was not used in any studies. There was no evidence that any of the treatment modalities was statistically significantly superior.

Authors' Conclusions

No included studies reported our primary outcome measure of interest, validated hand function. There was heterogeneity between the studies, which were of limited quality and size. No single non-operative treatment regimen for fracture of the neck of the fifth metacarpal can be recommended as superior to another in result. Further research is definitely warranted.

### Acute fractures to the proximal fifth metatarsal bone: development of classification and treatment recommendations based on the current evidence [^616d0133]. Injury (2012). Low credibility.

Fractures to the proximal fifth metatarsal bone are among the most frequent injuries to the foot. Various classifications intend to distinguish different fracture entities in regard to prognosis and treatment. The most commonly used classification by Lawrence and Botte delineates three fracture zones and gives treatment recommendations based on retrospective case series. Aim of our study was to critically review the literature and reevaluate the classification and treatment recommendations based on the highest level of evidence available. We performed a systematic literature search in Medline, Embase and Cochrane library and identified six prospective trials either comparing the same treatment for different fracture entities or different treatment strategies for the same fracture entity. The studies reveal that all "tuberosity avulsion fractures" (Zone 1, according to Lawrence and Botte) heal well using functional treatment. Even multifragmentary, displaced and intraarticular fractures in Zone 1 give comparable good results. Treatment with a short leg cast leads to a significant delay in return to preinjury level when compared to functional treatment. "Jones' fractures" (Zone 2) also demonstrate good to excellent results and complete bone healing when treated functionally. In contrast, "diaphyseal stress fractures" (Zone 3) at the distal limit of the fourth-fifth intermetatarsal articulation and just distally feature a significantly higher rate of treatment failure when treated non-operatively in a non-weight bearing short leg cast. Early intramedullary screw fixation leads to a significantly shorter time to bone healing and return to sport. In conclusion, acute fractures to the proximal fifth metatarsal bone should be classified into two entities only: First, metaphyseal fractures not extending beyond the distal end of the fourth-fifth intermetatarsal articulation, as these fractures, regardless the number of fragments, displacement and intraarticular involvement, should be treated functionally. Second, meta-diaphyseal fractures located at the distal end of the fourth-fifth intermetatarsal articulation or just distally, as these fractures require early intramedullary screw fixation.

### Treatment of fracture-dislocation of the proximal interphalangeal joint using the suzuki external fixator [^48f00a53]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2002). Low credibility.

We describe a simple technique for fracture-dislocations of the proximal interphalangeal joint. Eight fingers with a fracture-dislocation were treated with a self-manufactured dynamic external fixator, allowing early mobilization. The fixator consists of pins and rubbers. The clinical and radiographic outcome was evaluated and recorded. A near-normal function was obtained in four patients. The average total active motion was 82 degrees. Radiographic reduction was maintained. This external fixator is an inexpensive and simple technique for these difficult fracture-dislocations. Early intervention (before two weeks post-trauma) is recommended.

### Phalangeal neck fractures of the proximal phalanx of the fingers in adults [^a4fa93a3]. Injury (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

The outcome of adult phalangeal neck fractures of the proximal phalanx of the fingers has not been previously investigated. Purpose To report the outcome of adult phalangeal neck fractures of the proximal phalanx of the fingers following a specific management protocol.

Methods

A total of 10 phalangeal neck fractures of the proximal phalanx of the fingers in nine adult male patients are presented. Three patients presented with type I (undisplaced) fractures and these were treated with splinting for 3 weeks. There were a total of five type II (displaced but with bone-to-bone contact) fractures: two were stable after closed reduction and were treated with splinting alone and the other three were unstable requiring Kirschner (K)-wire fixation. The last patient had a type III (displaced with no bone-to-bone contact) fracture, which was treated with open reduction and K-wire fixation. We emphasised that K-wires should not immobilise any of the finger joints to allow immediate active motion after surgery.

All fractures healed clinically and radiologically without complications. The outcome in our series, following our management protocol, was excellent in one patient and good in the remaining eight patients.

Conclusion

Phalangeal neck fractures of the proximal phalanx in adults are rare and there are not many available options for fixing unstable type II/III fractures. Our protocol of management and the technique of K-wire fixation (leaving both the proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints free)followed by early active mobilisation gives consistent satisfactory results.

### Outcomes of pediatric proximal phalanx base fractures [^481ce81b]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Extra-articular juxtaphyseal fractures of the proximal phalanx are among the most common finger fractures in children. Immobilization of the digit for 3 to 4 weeks after reduction of the fracture is the current standard of care. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate outcomes after intervention among pediatric proximal phalanx base fractures and establish radiographic criteria to guide management.

Methods

A multi-institutional retrospective review of skeletally immature patients treated for proximal phalanx juxtaphyseal fractures between 2002 and 2019 was conducted. Variables collected included Salter-Harris classification; initial, postreduction, early follow-up, and final angulation and displacement on the posterior-anterior and lateral radiographs; clinical rotational deformity at final follow-up; and method of treatment. Exclusion criteria included less than 3 weeks of follow-up; Salter-Harris III, IV, and V fractures; inadequate medical record details; and missing radiographs.

Results

Six hundred thirty-four fractures meeting the inclusion criteria were categorized into no reduction, closed reduction (CR), and surgical (OP) groups. Only CR and OP groups saw large decreases in angulation by 11.8° CR (95% confidence interval, 10.1 to 13.6) and 19.0° OP (95% confidence interval, 8.7 to 29.3). Closed reduction patients had a mean coronal angulation value of 6.1° at post-reduction, which was maintained with immobilization to 5.8° at final follow-up. At final follow-up, scissoring was noted, three in the no reduction and three in the CR group for an overall 0.93% rotational malalignment rate.

Discussion

Extra-articular proximal phalanx juxtaphyseal fractures rarely require surgical management and can typically be treated with or without CR, based on the degree of deformity, in the emergency department or clinical setting. Low rates of documented sequelae after nonsurgical management were seen in this cohort, allowing for establishment of treatment parameters that can result in clinically insignificant angular and rotational deformity.

### Stress fractures of the distal phalanx in skeletally immature sport climbers [^050d514d]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Stress fractures in the distal phalanx of skeletally immature patients are rare and previously unreported clinical occurrences. We report on 2 adolescent sport climbers with such fractures of the dorsal metaphysis of the distal phalanx at the point where parts of the extensor tendon insert. A conservative treatment approach alone was sufficient in healing this fracture type in both patients after 12 wk. Clinicians should be informed of the existence of this rare clinical phenomenon and counsel patients that a conservative treatment approach may result in complete healing without the need for an invasive procedure.

### Metacarpal fractures: an evidence-based review to guide treatment [^02365a5f]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). Medium credibility.

Metacarpal fractures are among the most common fractures of the hand and upper extremity and can lead to substantial disability. Clinical and radiographic features of these fractures are important in approaching their management. While most metacarpal fractures can be treated nonsurgically with reduction and/or immobilization, some fractures and patients can have improved patient-centered outcomes with surgical fixation. Outcomes of surgical fixation (eg, percutaneous Kirschner wire fixation, plate/screws, interfragmentary screws alone, and intramedullary fixation) and postoperative care are best when tailored to the fracture pattern and patient.

### Pediatric finger fractures: preventing big problems after small fractures [^b14aed47]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric finger fractures are among the most common injuries of the hand. Although most can be treated nonsurgically with good results, a small subset benefits from intervention. The purpose of this review was to provide an update on potentially problematic pediatric phalanx fractures. We will review common finger fractures unique to pediatric patients, classifications, surgical indications, and treatment options for chronic presentations.

### Three-wire fixation technique for displaced fifth metatarsal base fractures [^029ead56]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Fractures of the tuberosity of the fifth metatarsal are the most common type of fifth metatarsal fractures. This particular fracture usually produces low morbidity and low rates of nonunion when treated nonoperatively. However, on occasion, significant displacement, comminution, or significant intra-articular involvement may warrant operative intervention. Multiple techniques have been described for the operative care of this fracture. We present a somewhat simplified fixation method for displaced fifth metatarsal fractures in a small set of patients who were all followed up to final healing of the fracture.

### Fingertip injuries [^ec939b4e]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint dislocation — management requires closed reduction and specific immobilization positioning: "Dislocation of the DIP joint requires reduction and splinting in full extension (for volar [palmar] dislocations) or 15 to 30 degrees of flexion (for dorsal dislocations) for 2 to 3 weeks". The presence of an open wound "necessitates surgical management with appropriate washout to prevent infection". After reduction, "periodic reevaluation is essential to assess joint stability and manage potential complications such as recurrent dislocation or joint stiffness", and "physical therapy and hand rehabilitation exercises should be initiated early to restore range of motion and strength".

### Surgical management of proximal interphalangeal joint repetitive stress epiphyseal fracture nonunion in elite sport climbers [^d5731e64]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Repetitive stress fracture of the middle phalanx epiphysis is an injury specific to elite adolescent sport climbers. As sport climbing becomes increasingly popular in younger age groups, an increased number of these injuries have been reported in recent years. To date, treatment of these fractures has been nonsurgical, with strict rest and physiotherapy prescribed until fracture union. However, when these patients present in a delayed fashion with an established nonunion, nonsurgical treatment may fail, leading to disabling chronic pain and/or digital deformity in some cases. In this article, we present 2 cases of surgical treatment for finger middle phalanx repetitive stress epiphyseal fracture nonunion, using a percutaneous spot drilling epiphysiodesis technique.

### Unstable middle phalanx base fractures treated with an internal joint stabilizer: preliminary results [^4c011757]. Hand (2024). Medium credibility.

The stabilizer is created by bending a 0.062- or 0.045-mm K-wire around a 2.0-mm Steinmann pin or K-wire to create the holes for the screws. The size of the loops is such that the screw shaft can easily pass through the loop, but the screw head cannot. These should be spaced far enough apart to provide ample working length with respect to the length of P2. Now, the transcondylar width of the proximal phalanx is assessed. The pilot hole is created under fluoroscopic guidance along the PIP axis of rotation. The drill is aligned with the center of curvature of both the medial and lateral PIP condyles (Figure 3b). The wire is then driven through the far cortex. Now the K-wire is bent to 90° to place the 2 screw holes at the proper level with respect to the distal part of P2. The length of the axis pin is measured with a depth gauge, and the wire is cut to this length. The axis pin is inserted into the proximal phalanx, and the alignment of the stabilizer with respect to P2 is evaluated. A final shaping of the stabilizer is needed to provide optimal reduction and alignment of P2. Finally, 2.0-mm screws are applied to the distal part of the stabilizer after drilling their pilot holes (Figure 4).

Lateral fluoroscopy of the insertion of screw through the internal joint stabilizer.

At this time, fluoroscopy is used to confirm that the implant appropriately fits the joint and the proximal and middle phalanx (Figure 5). The temporary fixation 0.028 wires are removed. Stability is tested, and sagittal plane views are taken in flexion and extension to ensure congruent joint motion. The skin is closed, and a sterile dressing is applied.

We encourage early active and passive ROM of the injured digit with a goal of 90 or more degrees of motion. We will frequently buddy strap the injured digit to the adjacent digit. Removal of the stabilizer is scheduled no sooner than 3 months postoperatively but can be delayed until the patient returns to a near-normal ROM. Hand therapy is often an integral component of the recovery course.

### Interobserver variability in the treatment of little finger metacarpal neck fractures [^973f5dce]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To address the null hypothesis that surgeons shown radiographs of little finger metacarpal neck fractures with measured fracture angulation would recommend surgery as often as surgeons shown unmarked radiographs.

Methods

Members of the Science of Variation Group, an international collaboration of fully trained orthopedic and trauma surgeons, were asked to review 20 little finger metacarpal neck fracture cases, which included a vignette and 3 high-quality radiographs. Members were then randomized to review radiographs with or without measured fracture angulation on the lateral view and select operative or nonoperative management.

Results

Surgeons shown radiographs with measured angulation were more likely to recommend surgery, and there was less variability among these surgeons, particularly for fractures with less angular deformity.

Conclusions

Measured fracture angulation has a small but significant influence on treatment recommendations for little finger metacarpal neck fractures.

### A unique fracture pattern of the proximal phalanx in children: fractures through the phalangeal neck with an attached dorsal bony flange [^79fc7028]. Injury (2004). Low credibility.

This paper describes a unique fracture pattern of the proximal phalanx in children that has not been specifically studied in the literature. Volarly, the fracture line passes through the phalangeal neck and then the fracture line passes dorsally to include a dorsal flange of the metaphysis. Fractures were classified into three types: type I fractures were undisplaced with no finger deformity; type II fractures were mildly displaced in the antero-posterior plane without lateral angulation or scissoring; while type III fractures were severely displaced or had associated lateral angulation or scissoring deformity. Over a 6-year-period, nine cases were seen by the authors. The mechanism of injury was by entrapping the digit in a closing door in all cases. The mean age of patients was 5 years. Types I and II fractures were seen in five children and all were treated by splinting with an excellent outcome. Two children with type III fractures were treated with closed reduction and either splinting (one case) or k-wire (one case), and both had a poor initial outcome. The remaining two children with type III fractures were treated with open reduction and internal fixation with an excellent outcome. Differences between these fractures and the classic phalangeal neck fractures are discussed.

### Early functional treatment of proximal phalanx fractures in children: a case series study [^b42a3226]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The objective of this study was to assess proper indications a nonsurgical treatment regime for pediatric fractures of the proximal phalanx based on principles of early functional treatment.

Methods

A case series (evidence level 4) of 30 pediatric patients with fractures of the proximal phalanx were treated nonsurgically using protective dynamic splinting techniques and fiberglass casting material. Assessments were performed clinically and by x-ray within 4 to 8 weeks of commencement of treatment. Outcome measures included Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score questionnaire as well as fingertip palm distance (cm) and dynamic pain interval assessments.

Results

All fractures healed without any clinically apparent bony deformities. Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand scores were of 25.17 ± 5.29 (mean ± SD), which indicated good functional results usually within 2 weeks of removal of dynamic splints. Fingertip palm distance measurements at endpoints were of 0.17 ± 0.27 cm (mean ± SD), which indicated an almost free range of finger motion. Absence of pain perception under active finger motion (dynamic pain interval) was noted at 14.10 ± 6.79 days (mean ± SD).

Conclusions

Well-established criteria for surgical treatment of phalangeal fractures exist. However, in our experience, a majority of pediatric fractures of the proximal phalanx can be safely treated nonsurgically with dynamic splinting along with shorter intervals of immobilization of the affected fingers and faster restoration of overall hand function compared to surgical treatment.
