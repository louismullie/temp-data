## Question

How do the BSG 2021 guidelines compare to other international guidelines for IDA treatment?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a comparison of the BSG 2021 guidelines for iron deficiency anemia treatment against other international guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the scope and methodology of BSG 2021. Then, I should verify diagnostic thresholds and iron study interpretation. Next, I will examine investigation algorithms by population and special contexts. After that, I need to compare treatment strategies, including oral versus IV iron and dosing. I will then review follow-up and recurrence policies. Finally, I should assess service delivery and quality improvement elements and synthesize key differences and implications for practice.

> Let me first confirm the scope and methodological rigor of BSG 2021, because that frames how its recommendations compare with others. BSG 2021 is a UK-focused, multidisciplinary guideline developed with GRADE-based evidence grading and an eDelphi consensus process, explicitly updating the 2011 version and emphasizing parallel treatment and investigation, which is a recurring operational theme in the document [^115H3pJJ] [^114jGWrN] [^111SEqxq]. By contrast, the AGA 2020 guideline concentrates on the gastrointestinal evaluation of IDA and uses GRADE to frame conditional versus strong recommendations, while ECCO 2015 focuses on IBD-specific iron deficiency and anemia, and the USPSTF 2024 addresses screening in pregnancy rather than comprehensive IDA management, so I need to be careful not to overextend cross-guideline comparisons beyond their intended scopes [^116yAa5W] [^1166aUq1] [^117QeKd6] [^115AkUP8].

> I need to check diagnostic definitions and iron study thresholds next. BSG 2021 aligns anemia with WHO thresholds and defines iron deficiency primarily by ferritin, while acknowledging that transferrin saturation helps when ferritin is equivocal and that a hemoglobin rise of at least 10 g/L within 2 weeks strongly supports absolute iron deficiency even if baseline studies are borderline, which is a pragmatic clinical anchor I should keep in mind [^1149wkcb] [^114J4SK1]. The AGA similarly uses WHO hemoglobin cutoffs and discusses ferritin thresholds with context sensitivity, noting that bone marrow–validated studies inform ferritin performance across a range of cut points, which reinforces the need to interpret ferritin alongside CRP and clinical context rather than in isolation [^111whJmb]. Wait, let me verify the ferritin threshold point I almost stated as universal; I initially thought a ferritin less than 45 ng/mL was broadly endorsed, but hold on, that value is emphasized in primary care summaries and not uniformly adopted across all specialty guidelines, so I should not overgeneralize it beyond those sources [^115WmkBo].

> Next, I should review investigation algorithms by population, starting with men and postmenopausal women. BSG 2021 recommends bidirectional endoscopy as first-line in these groups unless there is an obvious non-GI source, reflecting the higher prevalence of significant GI pathology including malignancy, and it advises against deferring iron therapy while awaiting colonoscopy unless the procedure is imminent, which operationalizes the parallel treatment principle [^116JMk3z] [^1114eHoJ]. The AGA likewise recommends bidirectional endoscopy over no endoscopy in asymptomatic postmenopausal women and men, aligning with BSG on the primacy of endoscopic evaluation in this demographic [^113mihHW]. I should double-check that both guidelines also emphasize celiac screening and H. pylori testing as part of the initial workup, which they do, reinforcing a comprehensive yet standardized approach [^111ZEKDh] [^115WmkBo].

> For premenopausal women, let me consider the nuance carefully. BSG 2021 advises screening for celiac disease but generally reserving bidirectional endoscopy for those with additional risk features or disproportionate anemia, reflecting the lower yield of malignancy in this group and the potential role of menstrual blood loss, which is a pragmatic, resource-sensitive stance [^1176Kw4P]. The AGA issues a conditional recommendation favoring bidirectional endoscopy over iron therapy alone in asymptomatic premenopausal women, but explicitly acknowledges that patients valuing avoidance of endoscopy may reasonably choose initial iron therapy given the very small risk of missed malignancy, which operationalizes shared decision-making in this scenario [^115oqn8e] [^1178hrdR]. Hold on, I should verify that both positions converge on celiac screening and selective endoscopy, which they do, albeit with different default thresholds for investigation [^1176Kw4P] [^115oqn8e].

> I will now examine special contexts that modify the investigation pathway. BSG 2021 recommends celiac serology for all with confirmed IDA, with biopsy confirmation if serology is positive or if endoscopy is already planned, and it highlights that seronegative celiac disease becomes more prevalent with age, which can lower the negative predictive value of serology in older adults and justifies lower thresholds for biopsy in that group [^111ZEKDh] [^115FCvNg]. For small-bowel evaluation after negative bidirectional endoscopy, BSG favors capsule endoscopy as first-line, with CT or MR enterography as complementary tests, and it advises that further investigation after a negative capsule is warranted only if IDA persists or recurs despite adequate iron therapy, which prevents over-investigation [^116ikbGA] [^1128QAde]. The AGA suggests an initial trial of iron supplementation over routine capsule endoscopy in uncomplicated, asymptomatic patients with negative bidirectional endoscopy, which is a more conservative imaging approach that still requires safety-netting for missed pathology [^1177fT4a]. Let me reconsider the role of H. pylori; BSG notes insufficient evidence for routine gastric biopsies solely for atrophic gastritis in IDA, whereas some primary care summaries suggest noninvasive H. pylori testing after negative endoscopy, so I should frame this as an area of evolving evidence and local practice variation rather than a firm conflict [^114STmYg] [^115WmkBo].

> Turning to treatment, I should confirm first-line oral iron strategies and dosing. BSG 2021 recommends starting with one daily tablet of ferrous sulfate, fumarate, or gluconate, with consideration of alternate-day dosing if intolerance occurs, and it explicitly advises not to defer iron therapy while awaiting investigations unless colonoscopy is imminent, which operationalizes parallel treatment and investigation [^111yT1Xa] [^1114eHoJ]. It also recommends monitoring hemoglobin at about 4 weeks and continuing therapy for roughly 3 months after normalization to replete stores, which provides a clear endpoint for maintenance [^113G7PHB]. The AGA notes that while historical dosing used 150–200 mg elemental iron daily, lower or alternate-day dosing may improve tolerability and absorption, and it supports an initial oral trial in most patients with reassessment for adherence, malabsorption, or ongoing blood loss if response is suboptimal, which aligns with BSG's pragmatic stance [^11531s8p] [^111SEqxq]. Wait, I should verify the point about modified-release preparations; BSG discourages them due to reduced absorption and lack of benefit, which is a practical tip to avoid underdosing [^111SEqxq].

> Now, I need to evaluate indications for intravenous iron and formulation choice. BSG recommends IV iron when oral therapy is contraindicated, not tolerated, or ineffective, or when rapid correction is needed, and it supports early IV iron when oral therapy is unlikely to succeed, such as in active IBD, post-bariatric anatomy, or ongoing heavy blood loss, which is consistent with a risk-stratified escalation approach [^116DCPpr] [^115U4U3J]. The AGA 2024 update reinforces IV iron as safe and effective, particularly after bariatric procedures that disrupt duodenal absorption, and it prefers formulations that replete iron in 1–2 infusions for efficiency, which dovetails with BSG's emphasis on timely correction and ambulatory delivery models [^1166Qywe] [^1171HNcN]. ECCO 2015 similarly prioritizes IV iron in IBD with moderate to severe anemia or active disease, reflecting concerns about malabsorption and mucosal side effects with oral iron in inflamed bowel, which strengthens the cross-guideline convergence on IV-first in these phenotypes [^116FymGj] [^114k8Tww].

> Next, I should review follow-up, monitoring, and recurrence policies. BSG recommends checking hemoglobin at about 4 weeks to confirm an adequate early response and continuing therapy for approximately 3 months after normalization, with periodic surveillance thereafter, perhaps every 6 months initially, to detect recurrence, which balances vigilance with resource use [^113G7PHB] [^111ryvCv]. It also recognizes that IDA recurs in a meaningful minority despite initial response, and in such cases long-term maintenance iron may be appropriate when the cause is unknown or irreversible, which is a practical pathway to prevent repeated flares [^111uqFT3] [^113jDSob]. The AGA emphasizes reassessing adherence, ongoing blood loss, and malabsorption if response is inadequate, and it supports individualized follow-up intervals, which is consistent with BSG's structured monitoring approach [^11531s8p].

> I should confirm service delivery and quality improvement elements, because these shape real-world implementation. BSG 2021 recommends designated, senior-clinician–led IDA pathways, clear referral points, and ambulatory bases for IV iron administration, and it encourages nurse-led clinics and reflex testing algorithms to streamline diagnosis and triage, which addresses the historical fragmentation of IDA care across providers [^1118ixYD] [^116jC22B] [^112wEeAD] [^114LkXo9] [^112UC91A]. These organizational recommendations are less prominent in AGA and ECCO, which focus more on clinical algorithms, but they are crucial for reducing delays, duplicative testing, and emergency admissions attributed to IDA in health systems [^112UC91A].

> Let me synthesize key differences and their implications. BSG 2021 is more prescriptive about parallel treatment and investigation, explicit about alternate-day oral dosing for tolerability, and detailed about service delivery models, whereas AGA 2020 leans more on conditional recommendations and shared decision-making, particularly in premenopausal women, and ECCO 2015 provides IBD-specific, IV-leaning guidance that complements BSG's broader population approach [^1114eHoJ] [^115oqn8e] [^116FymGj]. Hold on, I should verify that these differences reflect population, health system, and evidence-interpretation nuances rather than true conflicts; in fact, all three converge on bidirectional endoscopy for men and postmenopausal women, selective investigation in premenopausal women with risk stratification, celiac and H. pylori testing as indicated, and escalation to IV iron when oral therapy fails or is poorly tolerated, which supports a harmonized, risk-adapted clinical approach across settings [^113mihHW] [^1176Kw4P] [^116DCPpr].

> Finally, I need to ensure practical takeaways are clear and actionable. Confirm iron deficiency with ferritin and context, avoid delaying iron therapy while awaiting colonoscopy, start with once-daily ferrous salt with a plan to reassess at 4 weeks, escalate to IV iron early in IBD, post-bariatric states, or when rapid correction is needed, and embed structured follow-up with periodic hemoglobin checks to detect recurrence, tailoring long-term maintenance to the underlying cause and patient preferences [^111yT1Xa] [^1114eHoJ] [^113G7PHB] [^111ryvCv] [^115U4U3J] [^1166Qywe] [^116DCPpr]. If I encounter persistent or recurrent IDA after appropriate therapy and negative bidirectional endoscopy, I should consider capsule endoscopy and targeted imaging, and if all investigations are unrevealing, long-term maintenance iron is reasonable, with ongoing vigilance for evolving symptoms or biomarkers that would prompt re-evaluation [^111xYu63] [^113jDSob].

---

The BSG 2021 guidelines align with international guidance in recommending **bidirectional endoscopy** for men and postmenopausal women with IDA [^113mihHW], and **IV iron** when oral therapy fails or is not tolerated [^11531s8p]. Key differences include BSG's stronger emphasis on **celiac screening** [^111ZEKDh] and **service pathways** (e.g. nurse-led clinics, ambulatory IV iron) [^112wEeAD], and its more cautious stance on **FIT** for risk stratification [^1172SQqC]. BSG also provides detailed guidance for special populations (IBD, CKD, pregnancy, post-bariatric) [^115U4U3J] [^113N8GG9] [^116FxeX4] and supports alternate-day oral iron to improve tolerability [^111TkZoi]. Overall, BSG is more prescriptive on investigation and service delivery, whereas AGA/ECCO are more flexible on oral vs IV iron and population-specific strategies [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and initial assessment

### Diagnostic criteria

BSG 2021 defines anemia as Hb below the lab lower limit and confirms iron deficiency with **ferritin as the primary marker**, using transferrin saturation when ferritin is equivocal [^1149wkcb] [^114N2wZa]. AGA similarly uses ferritin and transferrin saturation, and recognizes ferritin thresholds of 15–100 ng/mL depending on context [^111whJmb]. ECCO applies WHO anemia definitions and ferritin < 100 µg/L or TSAT < 20% for iron deficiency in IBD [^116b4KaN].

---

### Initial assessment

BSG 2021 recommends a detailed history, urinalysis, and routine **celiac screening** [^111ZEKDh] for all IDA patients [^117Fb1TR]. AGA also supports celiac screening and urinalysis but is less prescriptive on routine celiac testing in all-comers [^115WmkBo]. ECCO focuses on IBD-specific assessment, including disease activity and prior surgery [^notfound].

---

## Gastrointestinal investigation

### Bidirectional endoscopy

BSG 2021 recommends bidirectional endoscopy (gastroscopy and colonoscopy) as first-line in men and postmenopausal women with IDA [^116JMk3z], with **CT colonography** when colonoscopy is unsuitable [^116ej2AF]. AGA likewise recommends **bidirectional endoscopy** for asymptomatic postmenopausal women and men with IDA [^113mihHW]. ECCO emphasizes individualized investigation based on **IBD activity** and prior surgery [^notfound].

---

### Premenopausal women

BSG 2021 advises **celiac screening** [^111ZEKDh] and reserving endoscopy for those with red flags, recurrent/persistent IDA, or family history [^1176Kw4P]. AGA suggests **bidirectional endoscopy** in asymptomatic premenopausal women but acknowledges that some may reasonably choose iron therapy alone given the low malignancy risk [^1178hrdR]. ECCO does not specifically address premenopausal women without **IBD** [^notfound].

---

### Small bowel evaluation

BSG 2021 recommends **capsule endoscopy** for patients with negative bidirectional endoscopy and persistent or recurrent IDA, with CT/MR enterography as adjuncts [^116ikbGA]. AGA suggests an initial trial of **iron therapy** over routine capsule endoscopy in uncomplicated cases with negative bidirectional endoscopy [^1177fT4a]. ECCO supports **small bowel imaging** in IBD patients when indicated by disease activity or symptoms [^notfound].

---

## Iron replacement therapy

### Oral iron therapy

BSG 2021 recommends starting with one daily **ferrous sulfate, fumarate, or gluconate** tablet [^111yT1Xa]; if not tolerated, use alternate-day dosing or switch to **IV iron** [^116DCPpr]. AGA supports an initial oral trial, noting no clear superiority among oral formulations and allowing lower or alternate-day dosing to improve tolerability [^11531s8p]. ECCO recommends oral iron in quiescent IBD with **mild anemia (Hb ≥ 10 g/dL)** [^116FymGj].

---

### Intravenous iron therapy

BSG 2021 recommends **IV iron** when oral therapy is contraindicated, ineffective, or not tolerated, or when rapid correction is needed [^116DCPpr]. AGA similarly supports IV iron for **severe IDA**, intolerance, or malabsorption, and prefers formulations that replete in 1–2 infusions [^1171HNcN]. ECCO recommends IV iron as first-line in active IBD, moderate-to-severe anemia (**Hb < 10 g/dL**), or oral intolerance [^116FymGj].

---

### Special populations

- **IBD**: BSG and ECCO prioritize IV iron in active disease or moderate-to-severe anemia; BSG notes intolerance and malabsorption with oral iron in IBD [^115U4U3J] [^116FymGj].
- **CKD**: BSG directs clinicians to nephrology guidelines; IV iron is often required in dialysis or when oral iron fails [^113N8GG9].
- **Pregnancy**: BSG supports oral iron first-line; IV iron is reserved for intolerance or failure, with gastroscopy/MR enterography considered safe after the first trimester if needed [^116FxeX4].
- **Post-bariatric surgery**: BSG and AGA recommend IV iron when malabsorption or intolerance limits oral repletion [^116DCPpr] [^1166Qywe].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

BSG 2021 recommends checking Hb at 2–4 weeks [^112YD5sj], continuing iron for ~3 months after Hb normalization, and **periodic surveillance every 6–12 months** to detect recurrence [^notfound]. AGA advises reassessment at 2–4 weeks and addressing **nonadherence, malabsorption, or ongoing blood loss** if response is inadequate [^11531s8p]. ECCO recommends periodic screening in IBD and retreatment when **ferritin falls below 100 µg/L or Hb drops below 12–13 g/dL** [^114k8Tww].

---

## Emerging evidence and controversies

- **FIT**: BSG notes insufficient evidence to recommend FIT for risk stratification in IDA, citing sensitivity concerns and evolving evidence [^1172SQqC].
- **Alternate-day dosing**: BSG supports alternate-day oral iron to improve tolerability and adherence, supported by emerging evidence [^111TkZoi].
- **Service delivery**: BSG emphasizes nurse-led clinics, ambulatory IV iron, and clear referral pathways to streamline care [^116jC22B].

## Summary of key differences

| **Aspect** | **BSG 2021** | **AGA 2020** | **ECCO 2015** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Celiac screening | Routine for all IDA | Recommended | Not specified |
| FIT use | Not recommended | Not specified | Not specified |
| IV iron preference | Oral first; IV if failed | Oral first; IV if failed | IV first in active IBD |
| Service delivery | Emphasizes pathways | Not specified | Not specified |
| Alternate-day dosing | Recommended | Considered | Not specified |

---

BSG 2021 is broadly aligned with AGA and ECCO on bidirectional endoscopy and IV iron indications, but is **more prescriptive on celiac screening**, **service delivery**, and **alternate-day dosing**, and more cautious on FIT. ECCO is more IV-forward in IBD, whereas AGA allows more flexibility in oral vs IV selection.

Executive summary of recommendations and practice statements

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common, and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and so GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

Definitions

We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

Scope

The objective of these guidelines is to summarise contemporary evidence on the diagnosis and management of IDA in adults, and to provide recommendations based on this in the light of developments since the original publication in 2000, last updated in 2011. The guidelines are primarily intended for health professionals in primary and secondary care in the UK, though many aspects are relevant to health services elsewhere in the world.

Method

These guidelines were commissioned by the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) in 2018, following a proposal approved by the Clinical Standards and Services Committee. They were developed in accordance with the BSG guideline process (revised version 2018) and the Agree II instrument.

A committee of 13 members was convened from interested individuals representing a range of disciplines including gastroenterology, haematology, specialist nursing and patient groups, under the co-chairmanship of AFG and NB. Two lay members on the Guideline Committee represented patients and the general public. Following discussion of the scope and purpose of the guidelines and the key issues, a formal literature search was undertaken by the National Guidelines Centre using all subcategories of the term "iron deficiency anaemia". Leads were identified to oversee the writing of section drafts based on a review of the relevant literature, and to produce draft sets of recommendations relevant to each section: Definitions — WT; Initial assessment — JS; Coeliac disease and further evaluation — RS; Treatment — ILPB; Special situations — MP, NB, AFG; Service considerations — RL. JS led on collating the consensus statements and editing the section drafts into a unified guideline document.

These recommendations were subject to three rounds of anonymised consensus voting by the full committee in an eDelphi exercise during 2020 using an online platform (ECD Solutions, Columbus, USA). Recommendations were modified in the light of feedback from previous rounds, and those reaching a consensus of over 80% were incorporated into the final document.

For each statement, section leads provided a grading of the quality of the supporting evidence, and the strength of the recommendation — these assessments were all ratified by the co-chairs. The quality of the supporting evidence was semi-quantified using the GRADE system (high, moderate, low, very low). The recommendation strength (strong, weak) was based on the evidence quality, but as in many cases this was low or very low, a range of other factors were considered including (as appropriate) the degree of consensus, the perceived risk/benefit balance, patient views, resource costs and expert opinion.

Information regarding evidence quality, eDelphi consensus and recommendation strength is summarised for each statement in the executive summary. The final document was read and approved by all members of the guideline committee, and formally assessed and approved by the Clinical Services and Standards Committee of the BSG.

Background

1. Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common, and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

2. IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and so GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

Anaemia affects about a third of the global population and is a major cause of morbidity worldwide. Iron deficiency is one of the dominant causes, and the resulting anaemia (iron deficiency anaemia (IDA)) has a point prevalence of 2%–5% among adult men and postmenopausal women in the developed world.

IDA is the most common form of anaemia seen in primary care in the UK. It is estimated to account for more than 57 000 emergency admissions to UK hospitals each year, costing the National Health Service (NHS) more than £55 million per annum.

While menstrual loss is commonly the cause of IDA in premenopausal women, IDA in adult men and postmenopausal women is often due to chronic blood loss from the GI tract. IDA may be the first presenting manifestation of colonic or oesophago-gastric carcinoma, highlighting the importance of swift and complete investigation. There are however many other recognised causes of IDA (table 1) including malabsorption (most commonly from coeliac disease (CD) in the UK), poor dietary intake, blood donation, gastrectomy and use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). IDA is often multifactorial, and dual pathology (ie, significant disease in both upper and lower GI tract) is found in 1%–10% of cases — this should be particularly considered in the older patient.

Table 1
Pathological disorders associated with iron deficiency anaemia

IDA may present in primary care, or across a range of specialties in secondary care, and historically the management of IDA was often suboptimal — with investigation being slow, inadequate or incomplete. Over recent years, however, the recognition that IDA may reflect serious underlying GI pathology has resulted in increasing involvement of gastroenterology services. IDA may now account for 10% or more of all gastroenterology referrals, and a typical district hospital unit in the UK with a catchment of 250 000 may have in excess of 400 IDA referrals per annum.

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is a major cause of morbidity and burden of disease worldwide. It can generally be diagnosed by blood testing and remedied by iron replacement therapy (IRT) using the oral or intravenous route. The many causes of iron deficiency include poor dietary intake and malabsorption of dietary iron, as well as a number of significant gastrointestinal (GI) pathologies. Because blood is iron-rich it can result from chronic blood loss, and this is a common mechanism underlying the development of IDA-for example, as a consequence of menstrual or GI blood loss. Approximately a third of men and postmenopausal women presenting with IDA have an underlying pathological abnormality, most commonly in the GI tract. Therefore optimal management of IDA requires IRT in combination with appropriate investigation to establish the underlying cause. Unexplained IDA in all at-risk individuals is an accepted indication for fast-track secondary care referral in the UK because GI malignancies can present in this way, often in the absence of specific symptoms. Bidirectional GI endoscopy is the standard diagnostic approach to examination of the upper and lower GI tract, though radiological scanning is an alternative in some situations for assessing the large bowel. In recurrent or refractory IDA, wireless capsule endoscopy plays an important role in assessment of the small bowel. IDA may present in primary care or across a range of specialties in secondary care, and because of this and the insidious nature of the condition it has not always been optimally managed despite the considerable burden of disease- with investigation sometimes being inappropriate, incorrectly timed or incomplete, and the role of IRT for symptom relief neglected. It is therefore important that contemporary guidelines for the management of IDA are available to all clinicians. This document is a revision of previous British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines, updated in the light of subsequent evidence and developments.

Treatment of IDA

17. We recommend that IRT should not be deferred while awaiting investigations for IDA unless colonoscopy is imminent (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

18. We recommend that the initial treatment of IDA should be with one tablet per day of ferrous sulphate, fumarate or gluconate. If not tolerated, a reduced dose of one tablet every other day, alternative oral preparations or parenteral iron should be considered (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

19. Limited transfusion of packed red cells may on occasion be required to treat symptomatic IDA, in which case IRT is still necessary post-transfusion (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

20. We recommend that patients should be monitored in the first 4 weeks for an Hb response to oral iron, and treatment should be continued for a period of around 3 months after normalisation of the Hb level, to ensure adequate repletion of the marrow iron stores (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

21. We recommend that parenteral iron should be considered when oral iron is contraindicated, ineffective or not tolerated. This consideration should be at any early stage if oral IRT is judged unlikely to be effective (see text), and/or the correction of IDA is particularly urgent (evidence quality — high, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

22. There is insufficient evidence to support invasive investigation in non-anaemic iron deficiency unless there are additional indications (see text), but periodic blood count monitoring is suggested (evidence quality-low, consensus-92%, statement strength-weak).

23. After the restoration of Hb and iron stores with IRT, we recommend that the blood count should be monitored periodically (perhaps every 6 months initially) to detect recurrent IDA (evidence quality — very low, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

The treatment of iron deficiency aims to (i) restore normal circulating Hb levels, (ii) replenish body iron stores, (iii) improve quality of life and (iv) improve physiological function. Successful IRT should achieve all of these outcomes. An algorithm providing an overview of the treatment of IDA is shown in figure 3, and the elements of this are discussed in more detail below.

Definitions

3. We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

4. We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

5. We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

Anaemia

The WHO defines anaemia as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below 130 g/L in men over 15 years of age, below 120 g/L in non-pregnant women over 15 years of age and below 110 g/L in pregnant women in the second and third trimester. The diagnostic criteria for anaemia in IDA vary between published studies. The normal range for Hb also varies between different populations in the UK. It is reasonable to use the lower limit of the normal range for the laboratory performing the test to define anaemia, but these should be aligned with the WHO defined lower limits.

There is little consensus as to the level of anaemia that requires investigation. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) referral guidelines in the UK for suspected lower GI cancer suggest that IDA with an Hb concentration < 110 g/L in men or < 100 g/L in non-menstruating women warrants fast-track referral. These cut-off values will however miss some cases of colorectal cancer, especially in men. It is therefore advised that investigation should be considered at any level of anaemia in the presence of iron deficiency, though the case is stronger in those with more severe degrees of anaemia, as they are more likely to have serious underlying GI pathology.

Initial clinical assessment

6. We recommend taking a detailed history, as it may provide important clues as to the cause(s) of IDA in the individual case (evidence quality — low, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

7. We recommend that initial investigation of confirmed IDA should include urinalysis or urine microscopy, screening for coeliac disease (CD) and in appropriate cases, endoscopic examination of the upper and lower GI tract (evidence quality — moderate, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

8. CD is found in 3%–5% of cases of IDA, and we recommend that it should be routinely screened for serologically, or on small bowel biopsy at the time of gastroscopy (evidence quality — high, consensus — 84%, statement strength — strong).

9. Age, sex, Hb concentration and mean cell volume are all independent predictors of risk of GI cancer in IDA, and need to be considered as part of a holistic risk assessment. It follows that the cancer risk in iron deficiency without anaemia is low (evidence quality — high, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

10. There are insufficient grounds at present to recommend faecal immunochemical testing for risk stratification in patients with IDA. The evidence base is evolving rapidly, however, and on that basis, this guidance may therefore change. (evidence quality — low, consensus — 100%, statement strength — weak).

11. We recommend that in men and postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed IDA, gastroscopy and colonoscopy should generally be the first-line GI investigations. In those not suitable for colonoscopy, CT colonography is a reasonable alternative (evidence quality — moderate, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

Service provision

IDA is a common clinical problem with fairly clear diagnostic criteria, a degree of case homogeneity, and straightforward algorithms for treatment and investigation. These features make the condition eminently suitable for streamlined management in dedicated nurse-led IDA clinics, as have been developed in a number of units around the UK. An algorithm for the management approach to IDA is suggested in figure 2.

Treatment of IDA

We recommend that IRT should not be deferred while awaiting investigations for IDA unless colonoscopy is imminent (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that the initial treatment of IDA should be with one tablet per day of ferrous sulphate, fumarate or gluconate. If not tolerated, a reduced dose of one tablet every other day, alternative oral preparations or parenteral iron should be considered (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
Limited transfusion of packed red cells may on occasion be required to treat symptomatic IDA, in which case IRT is still necessary post-transfusion (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that patients should be monitored in the first 4 weeks for an Hb response to oral iron, and treatment should be continued for a period of around 3 months after normalisation of the Hb level, to ensure adequate repletion of the marrow iron stores (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that parenteral iron should be considered when oral iron is contraindicated, ineffective or not tolerated. This consideration should be at any early stage if oral IRT is judged unlikely to be effective (see the Treatment section), and/or the correction of IDA is particularly urgent (evidence quality — high, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

Oral IRT

It is usual to start treatment for IDA as soon as the diagnosis has been confirmed by laboratory investigation, so that the treatment and investigation of IDA proceed in parallel. There is usually a beneficial rise in Hb within 2 weeks of commencing oral IRT. Oral iron preparations often stain the stools and may cause constipation, so it is usual practice to pause these prior to bowel preparation for colonoscopy. Therefore, if a patient is to be investigated for IDA within 2 weeks, it would be appropriate to delay treatment until after the colonoscopy has been completed. There is no need to withhold oral iron before gastroscopy or CT colonography.

Traditionally oral iron salts were taken as split dose, two or three times a day. More recent data suggest that lower doses and more infrequent administration may be just as effective, while probably associated with lower rates of adverse effects. In addition, it may be inconvenient for some people to find three periods during the day to take iron on an empty stomach.

Various oral iron preparations are available in the UK (table 3). Traditional oral iron salts (ferrous sulfate, ferrous gluconate and ferrous fumarate) are inexpensive, effective, safe and readily available — and they remain the standard therapies for IDA. Their use is supported by considerable clinical experience and observational data. In a pooled analysis of trial data, 72.8% of patients with IDA demonstrated a satisfactory response to an oral iron formulation, defined as an Hb rise of > 10 g/L within 2 weeks, though rates of normalisation of Hb were lower with continued bleeding or clinically evident GI disease.

Table 3
A comparison of oral iron preparations available in the UK (February 2021)

A Cochrane analysis in 2014 highlighted that the reviewed trials were of poor quality, but concluded that in comparison to placebo oral IRT significantly improves Hb levels in IDA, and probably reduces blood transfusion requirements. When given in standard doses there do not appear to be important differences in efficacy or adverse events, although side effects may be lower with less than daily dosing. Modified release preparations (table 3) release iron in the more distal small bowel beyond the areas of most active assimilation — they do not enhance iron absorptionor reduce side effects, and their use is not recommended.

Follow-up and recurrent IDA

12. Hb levels normalise with iron replacement therapy (IRT) in most cases of IDA, but IDA recurs in a minority of these on long-term follow-up (evidence quality — low, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

16. We recommend that long-term IRT may be an appropriate strategy when the cause of recurrent IDA is unknown or irreversible (evidence quality — low, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

23. After the restoration of Hb and iron stores with IRT, we recommend that the blood count should be monitored periodically (perhaps every 6 months initially) to detect recurrent IDA (evidence quality — very low, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

IDA should be treated with IRT as detailed in the Treatment section, and if the initial investigation reveals the cause, it should obviously be addressed as appropriate. However, the majority of individuals presenting with unexplained IDA will have negative BDE, no evidence of CD, no other symptoms, and a complete and sustained haematological response to IRT. In this situation, the outlook is generally favourable, and there is no need for further investigation other than a periodic blood count after completion of IRT to check for recurrent IDA. In an era of limited resources, we would suggest checks at perhaps 3, 6, 12 and 24 months.

Further investigation is however warranted if there is any evidence of active undiagnosed pathology. Pointers to this possibility include symptoms such as ongoing weight loss or chronic unexplained diarrhoea, persistently elevated inflammatory markers and the persistence or recurrence of IDA. Persistent IDA describes the situation where there is haematological evidence of ongoing iron deficiency despite adequate IRT, while in recurrent IDA the haematological abnormalities resulting from iron deficiency resolve with IRT, only to reappear at a later date.

Table 4
A comparison of intravenous iron preparations available in the UK (February 2021)

The dose of parenteral iron may be calculated using the original Ganzoni formula. Modifications using a lower target Hb level (130 g/L) have also been used. Overall the different intravenous iron formulations appear equivalent in terms of the ultimate haematological response and safety, but the total dose preparations provide more rapid replenishment of body iron stores, usually in just one or two infusions. Monitoring for a satisfactory Hb response after 2–4 weeks should be undertaken, and then as outlined below.

Treatment of NAID

The efficacy of IRT for NAID (also termed isolated hypoferritinaemia) is unclear. There are limited studies in adults, with a variety of inclusion criteria and outcomes. A meta-analysis of these concluded that NAID was not significantly associated with physiological impairment assessed objectively by VO2 max or respiratory exchange ratio max (RERmax), and that IRT did not significantly improve either these parameters or maximal heart rate. There is however evidence that IRT may provide subjective improvement of fatigue, mental quality of life and subjective cognitive function in premenopausal women. Therefore, given the safety of the available iron preparations, it would be reasonable to offer treatment for NAID if symptomatic.

Monitoring after IRT

The optimal follow-up protocol after IRT remains to be established, but given the possibility of recurrent IDA indicating underlying disease, and the prevalence of persistent anaemia after IRT seen in some real-world studies, periodic monitoring is advised. Once the Hb has reached the normal range, a check blood count 3-monthly for 12 months and then 6-monthly for 2–3 years would be reasonable. Although SF is a reliable measure of total body iron stores, there are insufficient data to recommend routine ferritin monitoring.

Role of faecal immunochemical testing

The introduction of faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) for trace quantities of blood in the stool has provided a major step forward in risk stratification for those presenting with clinical features that are potentially due to colorectal cancer (CRC), and the value of it has been demonstrated in a series of large observational studies.FIT is currently recommended by NICE for determining whether IDA in the under-60 age group warrants fast-track referral–while this suggestion is logical, the evidence base is limited.

The place of FIT in risk stratification for the IDA population as a whole — either as a stand-alone or in conjunction with established tools — remains to be established. There are reasons for caution about a FIT-based triage system for IDA. First, CRC accounts for only a minority of the pathology found on the investigation of IDA, particularly in those under 60. Second, data from six recently published studies of real-world experience confirm that even at the low detection threshold of 10 µg/g, the sensitivity of FIT for CRC ranges from 83% to 91%. Furthermore, although numbers are small, there is the suspicion that IDA may be over-represented in the FIT negative CRC subgroup, accounting for 32 (40%) of the 81 pooled cases. The data are summarised in table 2. This conclusion is supported by a meta-analysis of the few IDA-specific studies in the published literature, which yielded a sensitivity of 83% of FIT for CRC, with concerns that this may be an over-estimate due to publication bias.

Table 2
Summary of recent real-world studies of the performance of quantitative FIT in the prediction of colorectal cancer (CRC) in adults with clinical pointers to this diagnosis, showing data for FIT-negative cancers with IDA (reference 68 assessed all-cause anaemia rather than confirmed IDA)

Currently therefore we are unable to advocate the use of FIT for risk stratification or colorectal cancer exclusion in IDA, though this view may change with the appearance of a stronger evidence base. While it seems logical to consider the result of FIT in the overall assessment of the risk serious organic disease, safety netting is still required to ensure that serious pathology is not missed. BSG guidance will be updated as further evidence for the role of FIT in IDA is evaluated, and a BSG Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland (ACPGBI) guidelines group has recently been commissioned to assess this.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^116yAa5W]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) present the official recommendations and highlight epidemiology, physiology, and evaluation considerations. U.S. epidemiology is detailed: In the United States in 1999–2000, 2% of men aged 16–69 years, 12% of women aged 12–49 years, and 9% of women aged 50–69 years were iron deficient, and 4% of women aged 20–49 years and 3% of women aged 50–69 years had IDA. The overall prevalence of IDA in North America in 2010 was estimated at 2.9%. Iron physiology notes that the normal total body iron content varies between 300 and 1,000 g and that about 1–2 mg of iron is lost daily through desquamation of skin and enteric cells or through minor blood loss. Gastrointestinal malignancy is the most serious potential cause, and in most adults without an obvious source of blood loss, evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract for a source of chronic blood loss or malabsorptive process is indicated. There is significant practice variability in the initial gastrointestinal evaluation of IDA. The next update for these guidelines is anticipated 3 years from publication (2023).

Who to investigate

The investigation of IDA potentially involves a considerable workload with a relatively low yield, and so there is a strong case for targeting valuable investigational resources. Cancer is by far the most serious pathology underlying IDA, but even following previous guidelines advising investigation of males and postmenopausal women, cancer is only found in 8%–10% of cases — and the majority of investigations reveal no other significant abnormalities either.

It is also important to bear in mind that premenopausal women do on occasion develop cancer in the GI tract, and that cancer is not the only GI pathology underlying IDA. There is therefore sometimes justification for investigating younger women — particularly if the IDA is severe or recurrent, and disproportionate to perceived menstrual losses (see the Special situations section).

There is now evidence that individuals with IDA can be stratified for the risk of underlying GI cancer based on a set of simple and objective clinical variables — specifically age, sex, MCV and Hb concentration. The IDIOM Apphas been developed to provide a swift estimate of GI cancer risk in IDA, which may help inform the patient discussion as to the potential benefit of investigation. Further refinement of the risk stratification process with the incorporation of additional clinical variables may allow the identification of sizeable subgroups who can safely avoid invasive procedures altogether.

Patient summary

Iron is a nutrient essential to life. It is used in the body to produce many cellular proteins, and an important one is Hb, the oxygen-binding protein found in red blood cells. A shortage of iron in the body prevents the production of these proteins, and so one of the major consequences is that the rate and quality of red cell production in the bone marrow is reduced — a condition called IDA.

IDA is common worldwide, and can result in many symptoms including extreme fatigue and breathlessness. It can generally be diagnosed by simple blood tests, and remedied by treatment with IRT given by mouth or injection.

There are many causes of iron deficiency, including a poor dietary intake, and failure to absorb dietary iron in the upper bowel. Because blood is iron-rich, it can also result from the gradual loss of blood from the body over the course of a long period — and this is a common cause of IDA.

Studies have shown that about a third of adults over the age of 50 with IDA in the UK have an underlying bleeding abnormality, most commonly in the stomach or lower bowel. In about a third of these, the abnormality proves to be a cancer. It is therefore recommended that unexplained IDA in this age group is investigated by examining these areas, even if there are no other relevant symptoms. This is usually done by endoscopy, though CT scanning is an alternative for assessing the lower bowel.

Chronic kidney disease

Anaemia is a frequent complication of CKD. CKD is a potential cause for anaemia in anyone with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m². As the prevalence of anaemia increases with deteriorating renal function, CKD is especially likely to be the cause of anaemia when the GFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m². The investigation and management of anaemia in CKD is a complex area, and readers are advised to consult specific guidelines relevant to UK practice published by NICE and the Renal association for more detailed recommendations.

The causes are anaemia in CKD are multifactorial. Iron deficiency is a major element, but multiple other mechanisms (eg, haemolysis, plasma cell dyscrasias) may also contribute towards the development of anaemia, hence the requirement for detailed haematological investigation. The causes of iron deficiency in CKD are also multifactorial. Renal failure itself contributes, but this may also be compounded by reduced iron intake, reduced iron absorption and blood loss via either the GI tract or other routes such as dialysis and phlebotomy.

Assessment of iron deficiency in CKD can be difficult. Measurement of ferritin and transferrin saturation may be helpful, but the interpretation of results is not the same as in patients who do not have CKD. Specifically, absolute iron deficiency in CKD has been defined as transferrin saturation ≤ 20%, with SF ≤ 100 µg/L (in predialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients) or ≤ 200 µg/L (in haemodialysis patients).

Patients with CKD may of course also have GI pathology underlying their confirmed iron deficiency. The decision about the need for endoscopic evaluation of the upper and lower GI tract in CKD can be difficult, and should ideally be made in conjunction with a nephrologist. However, the majority of CKD patients with confirmed IDA warrant GI investigation as long as they are fit enough to undergo these procedures.

The management of iron deficiency in the context of CKD is beyond the scope of these guidelines and is discussed in detail elsewhere. Treatment is usually initiated and monitored by the nephrology team. In brief, oral iron replacement may be tried in patients who are predialysis. However, intravenous IRT is required if this is not tolerated or ineffective, or if dialysis has been commenced. Other treatments for anaemia such as erythropoietin may also be needed, but these should be managed by the nephrology team.

Regarding medical management for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to iron supplementation, choice of formulation, AGA 2024 guidelines recommend to administer IV iron therapy in patients after bariatric procedures, particularly those likely to disrupt normal duodenal iron absorption, and having IDA with no identifiable source of chronic gastrointestinal blood loss.

### Patients over 45 years with iron deficiency require investigation [^116Tis9m]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) that occurs in patients above the age of 45 years is often caused by gastrointestinal blood loss, and guidelines on the appropriate investigation of these patients have been published. There are few data regarding patients with iron deficiency who are not anaemic and it is not clear how these patients should be managed.

Objectives

We set out to investigate the hypothesis that similar pathologies are likely to underlie iron deficiency and IDA, and to assess whether IDA was being investigated according to the guidelines published by the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG).

Methods

The pathology computer identified 153 consecutive patients over the age of 45 years who had serum ferritin levels below 20 microg/dl (normal range 20–200 microg/dl) in a 2 month period (i.e. October and November 2000). Medical records were examined and we recorded all investigations, the diagnoses reached, and the investigating specialty. The results were compared using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

The study shows that the causes of iron deficiency and IDA are similar, but IDA is investigated more thoroughly than iron deficiency, OR 2.07 (CI 1.08–3.97). Ten patients with iron deficiency without anaemia were found to have coeliac disease, a significant result, OR 6.71 (CI 1.38–32.6). The majority of patients with IDA are not under the care of a gastroenterologist and this group are significantly less likely to be investigated according to the BSG guidelines, OR 0.15 (0.04–0.6).

Conclusions

The study shows that the yield of investigation of iron deficiency is high and, hence, it should be investigated in all patients over the age of 45 years. Despite guidelines published by the BSG, IDA is investigated sub-optimally and measures other than the issuing of guidelines are needed to change practice.

Coeliac disease and IDA

CD is found in 3%–5% of subjects investigated for unexplained IDA as demonstrated by studies from the UK, Europe, USA and Middle East. Duodenal biopsy histology remains the gold standard for exclusion or confirmation of the diagnosis. Coeliac serology — anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) or antiendomysial antibody — is however a useful screening test. A prospective study of 2000 referrals for gastroscopy (all indications including anaemia, mean age 56 years) with parallel serology and histology yielded both a sensitivity and a specificity of tTG IgA antibody for CD of 90.9%, with a negative predictive value of 99.6%.

With emerging evidence on the reliability of serology with an anti-tTG IgA titre of greater than 10× the upper limit of normal, the BSG has issued interim guidance on a 'no biopsy' protocol in patients under the age of 50 years during the COVID-19 pandemic, provided they have no alarm symptoms. An updated guideline on the diagnosis of CD in adults is expected in 2022.

Retrospective studies suggest that antibody-negative CD accounts for about 2% of the total coeliac population, though this may be an under-estimate due to ascertainment bias (seronegative subjects are less likely to get a biopsy), and the true figure may be nearer 10%. As standard serological screening tests are IgA-based, apparently seronegative CD can result from IgA deficiency. This only accounts for a minority of antibody-negative cases however, and screening for it may not be cost-effective as the result only marginally changes the probability of CD.

As the relative prevalence of seronegative CD is highest in the elderly, the sensitivity of coeliac serology for CD falls with age. This has importance in the investigation of IDA, where the incidence is highest in the elderly, and the median age at presentation is over 70. As the sensitivity of serology for CD can be as low as 74% in coeliacs presenting with IDA, it may be that an age-related approach to investigation is most appropriate.

Mild IDA is common in pregnancy. IRT should be encouraged, but there is no need for endoscopic investigation unless there are pointers to the presence of underlying GI pathology in the history or on coeliac serology. If further investigation prior to delivery is felt to be warranted, gastroscopy, duodenal biopsy and MR enterography are considered safe for mother and fetus in pregnancy, though the National Radiological Protection Board considers it prudent to avoid MRIs in the first trimester. There are insufficient data on the safety of colonoscopy in pregnancy, and because of the potential to cause serious adverse events, it should be only be considered for the most pressing of indications.

Young men

27. Confirmed IDA is uncommon in young men, but when found we recommend that it warrants the same investigational algorithm as for older people (evidence quality — moderate, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

IDA is relatively uncommon in young men, but the yield of pathology on examination of the GI tract is considerably higher than in women of the same age. IDA in young men therefore generally warrants the same investigational algorithm as described for older people, unless a convincing explanation for it is evident.

Organisation

IDA has a considerable impact on referrals for urgent investigation for suspected cancer and non-elective services. This is due to the prevalence of IDA in the population, difficulty in distinguishing IDA from other causes of anaemia, and in some areas the absence of a dedicated referral pathway for the management of anaemia. In many hospitals IDA is no longer the prime interest of haematology, so becoming an 'orphan' condition without clinical leadership. This can lead to duplication of services, prolonged referral pathways and inappropriate investigation.

Anaemia is common in elderly patients and those with multiple comorbidities. The anaemia of chronic disease can mimic IDA, and in a study of fast-track referrals with suspected IDA, the diagnosis was confirmed in only 11% of cases. Therefore it is important to establish at an early stage that anaemia is due to iron deficiency. Fortunately, artificial intelligence or smart testing algorithms embedded within red cell laboratory analysers (reflex testing) are now available and can include specific recommendations for further management to primary care, including referral to a dedicated electronic IDA clinical assessment service which supports appropriate clinical interaction between primary and secondary care before any further investigation. Given the increasing fragmentation of care across providers, this should include a facility for interrogating electronic healthcare records for any previously documented diagnosis of IDA, and the results of prior investigations including oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy and CT colonography.

For a dedicated IDA service to deliver highly effective care, the four essential components areconfirmation of IDA, timely access to appropriate investigation (if not already investigated)ensuring appropriate IRT (with long-term therapy when needed) andstrong clinical leadership.

IDA services can also provide an alternative pathway for patients found to have more severe anaemia, and who otherwise might have been referred for emergency hospital admission. Estimates based on data from Hospital Episode Statistics 2017 suggest that up to 97 781 patients are admitted in England each year with IDA as the primary diagnosis, which is 72% higher than in 2012. Similar increases over the same period are seen for non-elective hospital spells (days in hospital) with IDA as a secondary diagnosis.

Further evaluation of the small bowel

In those with negative bidirectional endoscopy of acceptable quality and either an inadequate response to IRT or recurrent IDA, we recommend further investigation of the small bowel and renal tract to exclude other causes (evidence quality — moderate, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend capsule endoscopy as the preferred test for examining the small bowel in IDA because it is highly sensitive for mucosal lesions. CT/MR enterography may be considered in those not suitable, and these are complementary investigations in the assessment of inflammatory and neoplastic disease of the small bowel (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
After a negative capsule endoscopy of acceptable quality, we recommend that further GI investigation needs to be considered only if there is ongoing IDA after IRT (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, recommendation — strong).
We recommend that long-term IRT may be an appropriate strategy when the cause of recurrent IDA is unknown or irreversible (evidence quality — low, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

Purpose Of Review

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) still remains universally problematic worldwide. The primary focus of this review is to critique articles published over the past 18 months that describe strategies for the diagnosis and management of this prevalent condition.

Recent Findings

The medical community continues to lack consensus when identifying the optimal approach for the diagnosis and management of IDA. Current diagnostic recommendations revolve around the validity and practicality of current biomarkers such as soluble transferrin-receptor concentrations and others, and cause-based diagnostics that potentially include endoscopy. Management of IDA is based on supplementation combined with effective etiological treatment. Advances in oral and parenteral low-molecular-weight iron preparations has expanded and improved treatment modalities for IDA. Since the introduction of low versus high-molecular-weight intravenous iron administration, there have been fewer serious adverse events associated with parenteral iron preparations.

Summary

Best practice guidelines for diagnosing and managing IDA should include the design of an algorithm that is inclusive of multiple biomarkers and cause-based diagnostics, which will provide direction in managing IDA, and distinguish between IDA from the anemia of chronic disease.

Current recommendations for iron treatment

A recent international expert consensus proposed an algorithm for managing ID associated with chronic IBDs. ID was defined as serum ferritin < 100 µg/L or TSAT < 20%. Recommendations propose that all patients should be treated to correct anemia and iron stores.

The criteria for choosing between oral and parenteral supplementation remain debated. Factors such as etiology, severity of anemia, and quiescent or active nature of the IBD must be considered. In the active forms, the intravenous route avoids the risk of oxidative damage to the intestinal mucosa and preserves the intestinal microbiome, unlike oral supplementation. The indication for oral supplementation in the first line is preferably in quiescent forms, with mild anemia (Hb ≥ 10 g/dl). The parenteral route is indicated in case of intolerance or inefficacy of the oral route, or at the first line in active disease and/or more profound anemia (Hb < 10 g/dl). The British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines recommend that parenteral iron be considered when oral iron is contraindicated, ineffective, or not tolerated. Parenteral iron can be administered early if oral iron replacement therapy is deemed unlikely to be effective or if the correction of ID anemia is urgent.

Knowledge gaps

There is a lack of data on the benefits of ID therapy (relief of symptoms, quality of life) in these generally young patients and no long‐term data on morbidity and mortality.

### Iron deficiency anemia impacts disease progression and healthcare resource consumption in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a real-world evidence study [^1172haqP]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

However, in some rare cases, anemia can be due to B 12 and folate deficiency, medication toxicity, and other causes.

The prevalence of anemia in IBD patients has been recently estimated of 24% [95% confidence interval (CI): 8–31] in European countries. In patients with chronic conditions, the anemic state is also associated with a decreased quality of lifeand represents an important factor to be considered in therapeutic management. However, recent studies suggest that iron deficiency is underdiagnosed and undertreated in IBD in clinical practice.

The consensus statement of the SPIRIT–IOIBD (Selecting End PoInts for Disease-ModIfication Trials–International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases) indicated some endpoints to define disease progression in IBD. The expert panels agreed that the optimization in the management of both CD and UC should encompass a careful monitoring of short-midterm complications, as well as long-term complications. Thus, several culprits of IBD progression have been implicated, including the detrimental rebounds on health-related quality of life (i.e. disability, fecal incontinence), IBD-related surgery and hospitalizations, extraintestinal manifestations, including anemia, permanent stoma, short bowel syndrome, gastrointestinal and extraintestinal dysplasia or cancer, and mortality. Anemia in IBD has many underlying causes, above all the combination of chronic iron deficiency, anemia of chronic disease, followed by vitamin B12 and folate deficiency, and medication toxicity.

Moreover, the active disease appears to be a risk condition for anemia: the 2019 consensus guidelines of the British Society of Gastroenterology, based on an extensive systematic literature review of 88,247 publications, emphasized how about one-third of patients with active IBD develop IDA. Hence, further studies on the association between anemia/iron deficiency and disease progression in IBD are needed to improve the management of these complex patients. It has been reported that the persistent and recurrent manifestation of anemia in IBD patients correlates with more aggressive or disabling disease, and the evaluation of plasma biomarkers, such as Hb or hematocrit, has been suggested as a predictor of disease complication in CD patients. In addition, comorbid anemia in IBD is largely correlated with inflammatory activityrepresenting a significant predictor of increased risk of hospitalization and even increased patient mortality. –

For patients with intolerance or failure of Hb response at the 2–4 weeks point, alternate day traditional iron salts (if not already used) or ferric maltol may be alternatives to parenteral iron on those with mild-moderate anaemia (Hb > 95 g/L). The tolerability and response should be assessed, and failure of the Hb to rise by 10 g/L at 4 weeks for alternate day iron, or 6 weeks for ferric maltol, indicates the need for parenteral IRT.

Regular Hb monitoring is recommended to ensure an ultimately satisfactory response. The optimal interval is not clear, but every 4 weeks until the Hb is in the normal range seems reasonable. After normalisation of the Hb, oral iron needs to be continued to replenish the iron stores. Traditionally it has been recommended that oral iron is continued for 2–3 months to do this. However, the duration required and indeed the appropriate measure of true iron repletion are both unclear. In healthy, almost iron-replete subjects, 2 months of continued iron was considered sufficient. However, in patients with chronic disease, continuing blood loss, impaired absorption or GI inflammatory disease (where iron is lost from the GI mucosa), it is likely that a longer period would be required.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) — iron supplementation and route selection are as follows: Iron supplementation should be given to all patients with IBD and IDA. In head-to-head comparisons, IV iron had greater efficacy than oral iron in achieving a hemoglobin increase of ≥ 2.0 g/dL (odds ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.13–2.18) and greater treatment continuity (odds ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.13–0.59) in a meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials including 694 adults. Current consensus recommendations by the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization recommend IV over oral iron as first-line therapy for patients with a hemoglobin level < 10 g/dL, but oral iron may be appropriate in carefully selected patients with IBD who have mild anemia and inactive disease; if oral iron is used, close follow-up evaluation is needed to assess tolerance and response.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^111TkZoi]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Intermittent oral iron (defined as less frequently than daily) has been reported to be at least as effective as daily dosing in raising Hb levels in young women and during pregnancy, although less effective in boosting iron stores in the short-term. Intermittent oral iron is associated with a lower incidence of GI adverse events in pregnant women (relative risk 0.56; 95% CI 0.37 to 0.84).

The optimal drug, dosage and timing of oral IRT for adults with IDA are not clearly defined, and the effect of alternate day therapy on compliance and ultimate haematological response are unclear. Based on the available literature, a once daily dose of 50–100 mg of elemental iron (eg, one ferrous sulfate 200 mg tablet a day) taken in the fasting state may be the best compromise option for initial treatment. Whatever agent and regimen are chosen, it is essential to monitor the initial haematological response, and modify as appropriate with apparent therapeutic failure.

The best option for patients with significant intolerance to oral IRT (usually GI disturbance) is also unclear. Depending on the individual, oral ferric maltol, alternate day oral iron and parenteral iron are all options. The standard practice of switching to a different traditional iron salt is not supported by evidence.

Ferric maltol is a relatively new preparation, which is licenced for the treatment of IDA of any cause. In patients with inactive IBD, previous intolerance to or failure of traditional iron salts and moderate IDA (Hb > 95 g/L), 12 weeks of treatment with ferric maltol normalised the Hb in 63%–66% of cases.GI side effects and overall rates of treatment cessation were comparable to placebo. Due to a relatively low iron content, the rate of iron loading is comparatively slow with ferric maltol, but iron loading and tolerance were maintained during a year of active treatment, with normalisation of Hb in 89% of cases. Although more expensive than traditional iron salts, ferric maltol is considerably less expensive than parenteral irons.

Special situations

Young women

24. IDA is common in young women, and major contributory factors include menstrual losses, pregnancy and poor dietary intake (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

25. Underlying GI pathology is uncommon in young women with IDA, and so after screening for CD, we recommend that further investigation is warranted only if there are additional clinical features of concern — as detailed in the text (evidence quality — moderate, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

26. If GI investigation in a pregnant woman is deemed necessary prior to delivery, gastroscopy and (after the first trimester) MR enterography are considered safe in pregnancy (evidence quality — low, consensus — 91%, statement strength — strong).

The prevalence of IDA in otherwise healthy premenopausal women is 5%–12%. It usually reflects some combination of dietary insufficiency, menstrual losses, and increased demand for iron in pregnancy and breastfeeding.

Multiple studies have analysed the yield of GI investigation in young women with IDA. As CD is found in up to 4% of cases, all premenopausal women with IDA should be considered for serological screening. Malignant tumours can occur in otherwise asymptomatic premenopausal women, but they are extremely uncommon — two studies suggesting a higher prevalencehave been criticised on the grounds of selection bias.

In general, therefore IDA in young women is not an indication for endoscopic investigation. There are however various situations where direct endoscopic investigation of premenopausal women with IDA may be appropriate. These include:

Age over 50 — as age is a strong predictor of the risk of malignancy in IDA.
Non-menstruating women — for example, following hysterectomy.
Associated red flag symptoms, as outlined in NICE referral guidelines.
Indications of a major genetic risk of GI pathology — for example, colorectal cancer affecting two first-degree relatives, or one first-degree relative affected before the age of 50 years.
Recurrent or persistent IDA which appears disproportionate to other potential causes of iron deficiency such as menstrual losses — accepting that this is usually a rather subjective judgement.

Safety of IRT

GI adverse effects (such as nausea, diarrhoea, constipation) are much commoner with oral preparations, and there is no convincing evidence for the superiority of any of the readily available traditional iron salts.GI side effects are significantly commoner with oral ferrous sulfate than placebo (OR 2.32 (95% CI 1.74 to 3.08)) or parenteral iron (OR 3.05 (95% CI 2.07 to 4.48)), and there is no dose–effect relationship over the range 50–400 mg of elemental iron per day. Despite the high prevalence of mild side-effects, the rates of discontinuation in clinical trials due to adverse events are relatively low (0%–24%), though higher than rates of discontinuation of parenteral iron (0%–18%). Discontinuation of oral IRT seems to be commoner in observational and population studies, with reported rates of up to 40%.

How to investigate

Standard practice is to examine the upper and lower GI tracts at gastroscopy and colonoscopy respectively, and many units undertake both procedures at the same session. This approach is more efficient than separate procedures and, given the patient is already prepared, simplifies the decision to proceed to colonoscopy if there are abnormalities of uncertain relevance to IDA in the upper GI tract. Given that most series have revealed some cases with dual unrelated pathology, the recommendation is to defer colonoscopy only if an upper GI cancer is found. Overall, investigation of the GI tract in IDA reveals potentially significant pathology in about a third of cases — there is a myriad of recognised GI causes, as outlined in table 1.

CT colonography is an acceptable alternative to colonoscopy, and may be preferable in certain clinical situations, such as in the presence of major comorbidities. The advantage of CT colonography is that it is less invasive, does not require sedation and provides limited imaging of the other viscera. The disadvantage is that it does not identify more subtle mucosal pathology such as vascular malformations, and there may be some circumstances where a colonoscopy is subsequently required to obtain histology, remove a polyp, or insert a tattoo prior to laparoscopic resection.

There is a limited place for contrast CT without bowel preparation in those with IDA and major comorbidities including frailty, accepting that this will only identify relatively gross pathology, and will miss some cancers. The value of investigating those where the outcome is unlikely to affect management does however need to be carefully considered (see the Special situations section). There is no longer a role for contrast fluoroscopy in the investigation of the upper and lower GI tract in IDA.

Atrophic gastritis is a recognised contributor to the development of IDA, probably because of the impairment of iron absorption that accompanies all causes of achlorhydria. In support of this, subgroup analysis of a small study has suggested that atrophic gastritis may be commoner in those without a definite alternative explanation for IDA than in those with. Helicobacter infection has also been weakly associated with the risk of developing IDA, though it is unclear whether this reflects the effect of related pathologies such as peptic ulceration or atrophic gastritis. The same meta-analysis suggested that Helicobacter eradication does not improve the Hb response to IRT. It, therefore, remains to be established whether the cost of routine gastric biopsies in IDA is justified, given that the results are unlikely to directly alter management.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^113JwYQz]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

In a younger patient with IDA, where the sensitivity of serology for CD is high and the risk of other serious pathology low, a check on coeliac serology may be all that is required, with gastroscopy and biopsy only if the result is positive. Other factors of course may influence the need for further investigation — colonoscopy, for example, should be considered in those with a strong family history of colorectal cancer.

In an older subject with IDA, the sensitivity of serology for CD is rather lower, while the probability of other pathology and in particular GI malignancy, is much higher, and dual pathology is more common. So a more appropriate approach in this situation might be bidirectional endoscopy (BDE) with duodenal biopsy to exclude CD.

Presentation of CD in later life is well recognised, and indeed the seroprevalence of undiagnosed CD is similar to that in younger age-groups.CD in the elderly may however be more likely to present with manifestations of malabsorption, including IDA. There is conflicting evidence as to whether a diagnosis of CD over the age of 50 confers an increased cancer risk relative to the general population of the same age, but the possibility of a concurrent GI neoplasm should always be considered. Older patients with CD and IDA and any patient with alarm features should be considered for BDE, but no specific age or Hb cut-off can be recommended due to lack of published evidence.

AGA iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in asymptomatic premenopausal women — the AGA suggests bidirectional endoscopy over iron replacement therapy alone. Conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. Pooled evidence from 10 studies showed detection of lower gastrointestinal malignancy in 0.9% (95% CI, 0.3%–1.9%) and upper gastrointestinal malignancy in 0.2% (95% CI, 0%–0.9%) of premenopausal women with IDA. As a comparison, a recent meta-analysis found a prevalence of colorectal cancer of 0.1% (95% CI, 0%–0.1%) in individuals younger than 50 years. Comment: Patients who place a high value on avoiding the small risk of endoscopy, particularly those who are young and might have other plausible reasons for iron deficiency anemia, and a low value on the very small risk of missing a gastrointestinal malignancy would reasonably select an initial course of iron replacement therapy and no initial bidirectional endoscopy.

Within a total of 16 statements, recommendations are made regarding diagnostic measures to screen for iron- and other anemia-related deficiencies regarding the triggers for medical intervention, treatment goals, and appropriate therapies. Anemia is a common cause of hospitalization, prevents physicians from discharging hospitalized patients, and is one of the most frequent comorbid conditions in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. It therefore needs appropriate attention and specific care.

GRADE judgements of certainty

We will present summary of findings tables for all comparisons, which include our primary outcomes.

Based on risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias, we will grade the certainty of the evidence for each outcome as high, moderate, low or very low (described below). We will justify all decisions to downgrade the certainty of studies using footnotes, and we will make comments to aid the reader's understanding of the review where necessary.

GRADE Working Group grades of evidence:

High certainty: we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.

Development of recommendations and strength of recommendations

An evidence technical review meeting will be run to allow the GDG members to discuss and explore the technical summaries and GRADE recommendations for each of the PICO outcomes. Particular areas of focus will be those with little to no evidence and the almost certainly lower quality safety data.

For areas where no observational or higher evidence or sufficient to allow appropriate GRADE judgements was found, a small working group will be convened to produce proposed good practice statements. These will be produced based on the previous BSG IBD guideline statements with amendments as needed.

### BSG 2024 IBD guidelines protocol (standard operating procedures) [^113n1CKv]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

In the past 5 years, there have been several advances in the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aim for a new guideline to update the most recent guideline published in 2019. We present the prospective operating procedure and technical summary protocol in the manuscript.

Methods

'Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation' (GRADE) will be followed in the development of the guideline, approach as laid out in the GRADE handbook, supported by the WHO. The guideline development group is formed by a variety of disciplines, across both primary and secondary care that took part in an online Delphi process and split into key areas. A final consensus list of thematic questions within a 'patient, intervention, comparison, outcome' format has been produced and agreed in the final phase of the Delphi process. There will be a detailed technical evidence review with source data including systematic reviews appraised with AMSATAR 2 tool (Assessment of multiple systematic reviews), randomised controlled trial data that will be judged for risk of bias with the Cochrane tool and observational studies for safety concerns assessed through the Robins-I tool. Based on the available evidence, some of the recommendations will be based on GRADE while others will be best practice statements. A full Delphi process will be used to make recommendations using online response systems. This set of procedures has been approved by the Clinical Services and Standards Committee, the British Society of Gastroenterology executive board and aligned with IBD UK standards.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of hepatocellular carcinoma in adults [^112mPAxE]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

This document was commissioned by the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause for morbidity and mortality in the patient with chronic liver disease, and is a major global health issue. Since the publication of the previous BSG guidelines on this topic in 2003, several important clinical and scientific advances have been made. These clinical practice guidelines will provide evidence-based advice for the management of patients with HCC, as well as summarising in detail the clinical and scientific data underpinning the recommendations made. While much of the content will have broad relevance, the treatment algorithms are based on therapies that are available in the UK and have regulatory approval for use in the NHS.

These BSG guidelines represent a consensus of best practice based on the available evidence at the time of preparation. They might not apply in all situations and should be interpreted in the light of specific clinical situations and resource availability. Further controlled clinical studies may be needed to clarify aspects of these statements, and revision may be necessary as new data appear. Clinical consideration might justify a course of action at variance to these recommendations, but we suggest that the reasons for this are documented in the medical record. BSG guidelines are intended to be an educational device to provide information that may assist in providing care to patients. They are not rules and should not be construed as establishing a legal standard of care or as encouraging, advocating, requiring or discouraging any particular treatment.

Iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia (IDA) are some of the most common systemic complications of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Symptoms such as fatigue, reduced ability to concentrate and reduced exercise tolerance can mimic common symptoms of IBD and can therefore easily be overseen. Furthermore, clinicians tend to see mild to moderate anemia as an inevitable accompaniment of IBD that is sufficiently explained by the underlying disease and does not require further workup. But in contrast to these clinical routines, current guidelines recommend that any degree of anemia in patients with IBD should be further evaluated and treated. Multiple studies have shown that anemia is a main factor for decreased quality of life (QoL) in patients with IBD. Correction of anemia, however, can significantly improve the QoL of patients with IBD. It is therefore recommended that every patient with IBD is regularly screened for iron deficiency and anemia. If detected, appropriate workup and treatment should be initiated. Over the last years, a number of new diagnostic tools and treatment options have been developed. Multiple studies have demonstrated the safety of newer formulations of intravenous iron in patients with IBD and have compared oral and intravenous iron in various situations. Treatment recommendations have changed and new evidence-based guidelines were developed. However, to date these guidelines are still not widely implemented in clinical practice. The aim of this review is to draw attention to the need for treatment for every level of anemia in patients with IBD and to provide some practical guidance for screening, diagnostics, treatment and follow up of IDA in patients with IBD following current international guidelines.

### Practical guidance for the management of iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^1163fEF4]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Current situation

In 2013, a study across nine European countries was performed to evaluate the routine practice in the management of IBD-associated anemia. A total of 344 gastroenterologists from nine European countries were surveyed; 56% of the patients had at least moderate anemia (Hb < 10 g/dl), 15% had severe anemia (Hb < 6 g/dl). It was reported that 92% of the patients were treated with iron, but only 28% received intravenous iron (67% oral iron) despite international guidelines that recommend intravenous iron as first-line treatment in moderate to severe IDA in patients with IBD. This demonstrates that intravenous iron remains underused in Europe. There is a need to increase awareness and implementation of the international guidelines. The high prevalence of iron deficiency also indicates that monitoring is not sufficient.

Another paper in 2012 evaluated 631 online patient surveys from patients with IBD and anemia. It was reported that 33% of these patients received no treatment for anemia. Of those treated, only 27% received intravenous iron. Depending on the formulation of oral iron, 68–77% of the patients were dissatisfied with oral iron, mostly because of poor tolerability. In contrast, 72% of the patients treated with intravenous iron were satisfied with their treatment.

### Iron replacement therapy: do we need new guidelines? [^114JkrER]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Approximately, one-third of the world's population suffers from anemia, and at least half of these cases are because of iron deficiency. With the introduction of new intravenous iron preparations over the last decade, uncertainty has arisen when these compounds should be administered and under which circumstances oral therapy is still an appropriate and effective treatment.

Recent Findings

Numerous guidelines are available, but none go into detail about therapeutic start and end points or how iron-deficiency anemia should be best treated depending on the underlying cause of iron deficiency or in regard to concomitant underlying or additional diseases.

Summary

The study points to major issues to be considered in revisions of future guidelines for the true optimal iron replacement therapy, including how to assess the need for treatment, when to start and when to stop treatment, when to follow-up for relapse, which dosage and type of therapy should be recommended or not recommended, and if some patients should not be treated.

Depending on the circumstances, further investigation may involve repeat BDE, particularly if the original procedures were felt to have provided inadequate views or to be outdated. Detailed imaging of the small bowel is an important element of further assessment (see the Small bowel section). Finally, formal imaging of the renal tract should be considered regardless of the result of testing for microscopic haematuria, in view of the recognised association of renal cell carcinoma with IDA.

Depending on the definition employed, IDA proves to be recurrent in the medium term in 12%–25% of cases following previous negative BDE and a complete response to IRT. Recurrent IDA will respond in most cases respond to further IRT.

There are no established algorithms for the investigation of recurrent IDA, but our recommendation is to follow the principles outlined earlier. In particular, repeat BDE is advised if the previous investigations are outdated. There is no validated definition of this, but a threshold of 2 years has been suggested on the basis of limited evidence.

The diagnostic yield of small bowel examination by capsule endoscopy (CE) is high in recurrent IDA unexplained by adequate imaging of the upper and lower GI tract (see the Small bowel section). The most common findings are vascular malformations (sometimes single but more commonly multiple) and Crohn's disease, though tumours account for a small percentage of cases.

The prevalence depends on definitions, but in a significant minority of cases of recurrent IDA, no convincing cause is found despite comprehensive investigation of the GI and renal tracts. Long-term IRT is an appropriate management strategy when the cause of recurrent IDA is unknown or where it is irreversible, for example, secondary to atrophic gastritis or previous GI surgery.

### Guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia [^117GJGKa]. Gut (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) occurs in 2–5% of adult men and postmenopausal women in the developed world and is a common cause of referral to gastroenterologists. Gastrointestinal (GI) blood loss from colonic cancer or gastric cancer, and malabsorption in coeliac disease are the most important causes that need to be sought. DEFINING IRON DEFICIENCY ANAEMIA: The lower limit of the normal range for the laboratory performing the test should be used to define anaemia (B). Any level of anaemia should be investigated in the presence of iron deficiency (B). The lower the haemoglobin the more likely there is to be serious underlying pathology and the more urgent is the need for investigation (B). Red cell indices provide a sensitive indication of iron deficiency in the absence of chronic disease or haemoglobinopathy (A). Haemoglobin electrophoresis is recommended when microcytosis and hypochromia are present in patients of appropriate ethnic background to prevent unnecessary GI investigation (C). Serum ferritin is the most powerful test for iron deficiency (A).

Investigations

Upper and lower GI investigations should be considered in all postmenopausal female and all male patients where IDA has been confirmed unless there is a history of significant overt non-GI blood loss (A). All patients should be screened for coeliac disease (B). If oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) is performed as the initial GI investigation, only the presence of advanced gastric cancer or coeliac disease should deter lower GI investigation (B). In patients aged > 50 or with marked anaemia or a significant family history of colorectal carcinoma, lower GI investigation should still be considered even if coeliac disease is found (B). Colonoscopy has advantages over CT colography for investigation of the lower GI tract in IDA, but either is acceptable (B). Either is preferable to barium enema, which is useful if they are not available. Further direct visualisation of the small bowel is not necessary unless there are symptoms suggestive of small bowel disease, or if the haemoglobin cannot be restored or maintained with iron therapy (B). In patients with recurrent IDA and normal OGD and colonoscopy results, Helicobacter pylori should be eradicated if present. (C). Faecal occult blood testing is of no benefit in the investigation of IDA (B). All premenopausal women with IDA should be screened for coeliac disease, but other upper and lower GI investigation should be reserved for those aged 50 years or older, those with symptoms suggesting gastrointestinal disease, and those with a strong family history of colorectal cancer (B). Upper and lower GI investigation of IDA in post-gastrectomy patients is recommended in those over 50 years of age (B). In patients with iron deficiency without anaemia, endoscopic investigation rarely detects malignancy. Such investigation should be considered in patients aged > 50 after discussing the risk and potential benefit with them (C). Only postmenopausal women and men aged > 50 years should have GI investigation of iron deficiency without anaemia (C). Rectal examination is seldom contributory, and, in the absence of symptoms such as rectal bleeding and tenesmus, may be postponed until colonoscopy. Urine testing for blood is important in the examination of patients with IDA (B).

Management

All patients should have iron supplementation both to correct anaemia and replenish body stores (B). Parenteral iron can be used when oral preparations are not tolerated (C). Blood transfusions should be reserved for patients with or at risk of cardiovascular instability due to the degree of their anaemia (C).

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on inflammatory bowel disease in adults: 2025 [^115YA3Dp]. Gut (2025). Medium credibility.

In response to recent advancements in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) management, the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) Clinical Services and Standards Committee (CSSC) has commissioned the BSG IBD section to update its guidelines, last revised in 2019. These updated guidelines aim to complement the IBD standards and promote the use of the national primary care diagnostic pathway for lower gastrointestinal symptoms to enhance diagnostic accuracy and timeliness. Formulated through a systematic and transparent process, this document reflects a consensus of best practices based on current evidence. The guideline, while developed primarily for the UK, is structured to support IBD management internationally. It is endorsed by the BSG executive board and CSSC without external commercial funding, with involvement primarily supported through professional roles in public institutions and the National Health Service (NHS). Methodological revisions since the prior guidelines have enhanced rigor in technical review and development, with methodology details published independently following peer review. In developing the recommendations, 89 clinical experts and stakeholders participated in an online survey, identifying primary outcomes, such as clinical and endoscopic remission, as well as adverse event metrics, all stratified by clinically relevant effect sizes. These guidelines are intended to support clinical decision-making but are not prescriptive, recognizing that individual clinical scenarios may warrant tailored approaches. Further research may inform future revisions as new evidence emerges.

AGA iron deficiency anemia in premenopausal women — In asymptomatic premenopausal women with iron deficiency anemia, the AGA suggests bidirectional endoscopy over iron replacement therapy only, and patients who place a high value on avoiding the small risk of endoscopy, particularly those who are young and might have other plausible reasons for IDA, and a low value on the very small risk of missing a gastrointestinal malignancy would reasonably select an initial course of iron replacement therapy and no initial bidirectional endoscopy.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^11531s8p]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia — management of iron supplementation notes that although no formal recommendation is provided, clinicians should recognize available oral and intravenous formulations with varying costs and side effects, and in most patients an initial trial of oral supplementation should be given as it is generally effective, available, inexpensive, and safe. There is no strong evidence that any of the available oral formulations is more effective or better tolerated than the others. Historically, a daily dose of 150–200 mg of elemental iron has been recommended, but some studies suggest that lower dosing or every-other-day dosing may improve tolerability and absorption. Taking iron supplements with food or using enteric-coated formulations may improve tolerability but decrease absorption, and vitamin C co-administration is commonly recommended as it enhances absorption and may improve response to oral iron. If such a response is not seen, assessment for nonadherence (due to side effects or other reasons), malabsorption, or ongoing blood loss exceeding iron intake is needed. Intravenous iron may be appropriate in selected patients, such as those with impaired absorption due to prior gastric surgery, with inflammatory bowel disease or chronic kidney disease, or in whom blood loss exceeds the ability to replete iron orally, and consultation with a hematologist is often helpful when intravenous iron repletion is required.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anemia [^114vL6Nn]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a common hematologic condition, affecting a substantial proportion of the world's women and young children. Optimal management of IDA requires an accurate diagnosis, identification and correction of the underlying cause, provision of medicinal iron therapy, and confirmation of treatment success. There are limited data to support current treatment approaches regarding oral iron preparation, dosing, monitoring, and duration of therapy. New intravenous iron agents have improved safety profiles, which may foster their increased utilization in the treatment of patients with IDA. Clinical trials focused on improving current treatment standards for IDA are sorely needed.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^112uCEcb]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

The majority of small bowel lesions underlying IDA are subtle vascular or inflammatory abnormalities, undetectable by conventional radiology. CT enterography (CTE) does however have a role in delineating small bowel tumours seen on CE, and the combination of arterial venous and phases is helpful in characterising vascular small bowel tumours and detecting metastases. In addition of course, CTE may reveal evidence of other neoplasia underlying IDA, such as lymphoma or tumours of the renal tract.

Most series in the published literature on studies comparing CTE and small bowel endoscopy have combined cases of IDA and overt small bowel bleeding. Meta-analyses have concluded that CTE and CE/DAE are best considered complementary investigations.CTE may have a higher yield for tumours, although this is a tentative conclusion due to small numbers.

It also states that further studies are needed to determine optimal formulations and routes for iron repletion and to identify patients who would benefit from earlier IV iron administration, and that additional studies to elucidate optimal gastrointestinal management of difficult-to-treat conditions such as PHG, GAVE, and small-bowel angioectasias also are needed.

### Iron deficiency anemia: guidelines from the American… [^115WmkBo]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In anemia, iron deficiency is best diagnosed using a ferritin threshold of less than 45 ng per mL.
- Patients with IDA should receive noninvasive testing for H. pylori and celiac disease.
- Bidirectional endoscopy is recommended in all adults with IDA.
- Video capsule endoscopy is not recommended in asymptomatic adults with IDA. From the AFP Editors Iron deficiency anemia is the most common cause of anemia worldwide. It affects 3% of adults and is slightly more common in women younger than 50 years. The American Gastroenterological Association developed guidelines for the evaluation of IDA in adults. Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with iron deficiency caused by atrophic gastritis and hypochlorhydria, which reduce iron absorption. Treating H. pylori infection improves the benefit of iron supplementation in anemia. After negative bidirectional endoscopy results, the AGA suggests noninvasive testing and treatment for H.

pylori in IDA by urea breath testing, although stool antigen testing and serology can also be used. The AGA also suggests endoscopy in premenopausal women with IDA because malignancy is diagnosed in 1% of this population. In younger patients who might have a plausible nonmalignant cause of anemia, iron replacement can be offered without further exploration. During esophagogastroduodenoscopy, routine gastric biopsies are not recommended. Although autoimmune atrophic gastritis can be diagnosed by gastric biopsy, it has not been shown to improve long-term outcomes.

### Statin eligibility for primary prevention of cardiovascular… [^11651GRS]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance Despite an improved European-SCORE2 prediction model, the new treatment thresholds in the 2021 European-ESC guidelines dramatically reduce eligibility for primary prevention with statins in low-risk European countries. Using lower treatment thresholds can improve overall guideline performance. The European Society of Cardiology guidelines and other international guidelines on primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease follow the principle of matching the intensity of preventive treatment to the absolute risk of patients. 1 Thus, treatment with statins is restricted to those who have 10-year risk for ASCVD above certain guideline-defined treatment thresholds.
2. In this large, contemporary, population-based European cohort of apparently healthy individuals, we compared the 2021 European-ESC guidelines on primary prevention using statins with the US-ACC/AHA, UK-NICE, and 2019 European-ESC/EAS guidelines.

Although the 2021 European-ESC guidelines introduced a new and improved risk model, the updated age-specific recommendations dramatically reduce eligibility for class I recommended statins to only 4% with low sensitivity for detecting future ASCVD events. Importantly, we found that the clinical performance of the 2021 European-ESC guidelines could be improved by lowering the European-SCORE2 treatment threshold in either the overall population or by using age- and sex-specific thresholds. For obtaining similar clinical performance as in the US-ACC/AHA and UK-NICE guidelines, a European-SCORE2 risk threshold of 5% and 6% is needed, respectively. For obtaining status quo regarding the previous 5% European-SCORE1 threshold, a 7% threshold should be used with the European-SCORE2 model. The 2021 European-ESC guidelines have adopted a new age-specific treatment approach for the initiation of primary prevention with statins.

The rationale behind these new treatment thresholds is not explained in the guidelines. Our analyses show that they substantially reduce statin eligibility and, for practical purposes, phase out class I recommendations for primary prevention in women. Another important observation is that the clinical performance of the 2021 European-ESC guidelines could be improved by lowering the treatment threshold. Statin eligibility based on the European-SCORE2 is very sensitive to small changes in the selected treatment threshold. Thus, relatively small reductions in the selected treatment threshold can substantially improve sensitivity for detecting future ASCVD events with only minor losses in specificity.
