## Question

when to treat appendicitis with surgery

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to treat appendicitis with surgery. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying the disease as uncomplicated versus complicated. Then, I should verify the default standard of care and how strong the evidence is. Next, I will examine timing recommendations and whether delays are safe. After that, I need to consider exceptions where nonoperative management is reasonable. Finally, I should review special populations and synthesize a practical decision framework with shared decision-making in mind [^1164dGTB] [^11649sTQ].

> Let me first confirm the classification because management hinges on it. Uncomplicated appendicitis is acute inflammation without perforation, abscess, or generalized peritonitis, whereas complicated disease includes perforation, phlegmon, abscess, or diffuse peritonitis, and this distinction drives whether immediate surgery is mandatory or whether nonoperative care is acceptable [^113DyEfn].

> I should confirm the default standard of care. Appendectomy remains the gold standard for acute appendicitis, with multiple high-credibility guidelines recommending operative management as the preferred approach for both uncomplicated and complicated presentations, albeit with conditional recommendations reflecting evidence quality and patient values [^11649sTQ] [^1124akNB] [^111ECn16].

> Now, timing. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "immediate" meaning within hours; I need to check what the guidelines actually say. WSES recommends planning laparoscopic appendectomy within 24 hours of diagnosis and avoiding delays beyond 24 hours when surgery is indicated, while SAGES suggests that either immediate (< 12 hours) or delayed (> 12 hours) appendectomy is acceptable for uncomplicated cases, with very low certainty evidence for a strict 12-hour cutoff [^113KpmNN] [^112Kgwyf] [^1124x4C2]. Wait, let me verify the risk of delay; observational data show rising perforation rates with prolonged total intervals, especially beyond 48–72 hours, reinforcing the principle to operate promptly once the diagnosis is made and surgery is chosen [^1153k5jP] [^117VCgUZ]. But hmm, wait a minute, randomized and observational data also suggest that within 24 hours, outcomes may not differ substantially, supporting pragmatic scheduling rather than rushing to the OR at night when resources are limited [^113aNKaS] [^115vd7WG].

> Next, I should review when surgery is unequivocally indicated. I need to ensure I capture the high-risk scenarios: complicated appendicitis with perforation, abscess, phlegmon, or generalized peritonitis warrants operative management in most patients, with laparoscopic approach preferred when expertise is available and a low threshold for conversion if needed [^1113SnYg] [^114tAMJT]. Let me consider special populations; immunocompromised patients, pregnant patients, and the elderly generally merit timely surgery due to higher risks of perforation and diagnostic uncertainty, even though pregnancy-specific data suggest similar outcomes when managed surgically with appropriate imaging and technique [^1163ARHT] [^113A1yVL]. I should double-check that elderly patients are specifically prioritized for laparoscopy when feasible, which EAES supports [^113StoGK].

> But wait, what if the patient prefers to avoid surgery and the disease is uncomplicated? Nonoperative management with antibiotics alone can be considered for carefully selected adults and children with uncomplicated appendicitis after shared decision-making, acknowledging approximately 20–30% recurrence at 1 year and the need for close follow-up and clear rescue criteria [^113DyEfn] [^113ZHYDz]. Hold on, I should verify the strength of this recommendation; SAGES makes a conditional suggestion for operative management as the default, reflecting uncertainty and variability in patient preferences, while WSES acknowledges antibiotics as a reasonable alternative in selected patients who wish to avoid surgery [^1124akNB] [^115aFwyy]. I need to ensure we exclude patients with fecalith, high inflammatory markers suggesting advanced disease, or inability to comply with follow-up, as these factors reduce success of nonoperative care [^115aFwyy].

> Let me think about complicated disease where nonoperative care is sometimes used. For appendiceal abscess or phlegmon, initial nonoperative management with antibiotics and image-guided drainage when indicated is reasonable, particularly if laparoscopic expertise is limited, with interval appendectomy considered in selected patients, though recent data raise questions about routine interval appendectomy and favor individualized decisions, especially in older adults given neoplasm risk [^116c7ahG] [^115Eoa82] [^1134ZhZZ]. I should confirm that when advanced laparoscopic skills are available, immediate laparoscopic management of phlegmon or abscess can be safe and may reduce readmissions, but conversion should remain a low threshold option [^114tAMJT].

> I will now examine the operative approach. Laparoscopic appendectomy is preferred over open surgery in most patients when equipment and expertise are available, with advantages in wound infection, pain, and return to activity, though a higher intra-abdominal abscess risk has been observed in adults with perforated disease, which reinforces careful technique and selective use of drains in complicated cases [^116YeHKV] [^111sY8Aj]. Let me verify special populations; laparoscopy is safe and appropriate in obesity, older adults, and pregnancy, including the third trimester, when performed by experienced teams [^117PmMkS] [^115pw2X2].

> Next, I should review intraoperative decision points that influence outcomes. Routine drainage is not recommended for uncomplicated appendicitis, and for complicated cases, suction alone is favored over suction plus lavage, with drains reserved for select situations of diffuse contamination or concern for leak, given lack of benefit and potential harm from routine drains [^111wQJqC] [^115TMznS]. I need to ensure stump management is addressed; simple ligation is preferred over inversion, and leaving a stump ≤ 0.5 cm helps reduce stump appendicitis risk, with endoloops, clips, or staplers acceptable based on local expertise and case complexity [^114797V6] [^112yMXHK] [^1174pwZK].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework. For uncomplicated appendicitis, the default is appendectomy within 24 hours when feasible, balancing patient comorbidities, logistics, and preferences; nonoperative antibiotics can be offered to highly selected, reliable patients after informed consent about recurrence and follow-up requirements [^113KpmNN] [^1124akNB]. For complicated appendicitis, operative management is generally indicated, with initial nonoperative care reserved for abscess/phlegmon scenarios without peritonitis when appropriate expertise or resources are lacking, and interval decisions individualized thereafter [^1113SnYg] [^116c7ahG]. I should double-check that shared decision-making is emphasized across guidelines, which it is, given conditional recommendations and patient-value heterogeneity [^1164dGTB].

> Finally, I need to ensure special circumstances are not overlooked. In pregnancy, prioritize ultrasound and MRI for diagnosis and maintain a low threshold for timely surgery; in children, laparoscopy is appropriate and nonoperative care may be considered in select cases with parental involvement; in the elderly, favor laparoscopy and avoid delays due to higher perforation risk; and in resource-limited settings, adapt the approach while preserving the principle of timely source control and safe transfer when needed [^115pw2X2] [^111nzKwK] [^113StoGK] [^1163ARHT].

Treat appendicitis with surgery when there is **definitive imaging-confirmed appendicitis** or a **high clinical suspicion of perforation, abscess, or generalized peritonitis** [^113KpmNN] [^11649sTQ]. Surgery is also indicated for **failure of nonoperative management** or **recurrent appendicitis** [^113ZHYDz] [^113KpmNN]. For uncomplicated cases, perform appendectomy within 24 hours when feasible to reduce perforation risk [^113KpmNN] [^112Kgwyf]; in complicated cases (abscess, phlegmon, or perforation), urgent surgery or interval appendectomy after initial nonoperative management is recommended [^114tAMJT] [^115TMznS]. Laparoscopic appendectomy is preferred when available [^116YeHKV] [^111sY8Aj], and surgery should be individualized for elderly, immunocompromised, or pregnant patients [^117PmMkS] [^1163ARHT].

## Indications for surgical management

### Uncomplicated appendicitis

Uncomplicated appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix without perforation, abscess, or generalized peritonitis. The standard of care is **appendectomy**, typically via a laparoscopic approach [^116YeHKV] [^111sY8Aj]. Surgery is indicated for **definitive treatment**, to prevent progression to complicated disease, and to avoid recurrence [^113DyEfn] [^117B5yz6].

---

### Complicated appendicitis

Complicated appendicitis involves perforation, abscess, or generalized peritonitis. Management depends on the **clinical scenario**:

- **Perforation or abscess**: Initial nonoperative management with antibiotics and percutaneous drainage may be considered, followed by interval appendectomy in 6–8 weeks [^115Eoa82] [^116c7ahG].

- **Generalized peritonitis**: Immediate surgical intervention is indicated to control infection and prevent sepsis [^notfound].

---

### Failure of nonoperative management

Nonoperative management with antibiotics alone is an option for selected patients with uncomplicated appendicitis [^113DyEfn]. However, **surgery is indicated** if there is no clinical improvement within 24–48 hours, recurrence occurs, or the patient prefers definitive treatment [^113ZHYDz].

---

## Timing of surgical intervention

### Uncomplicated appendicitis

For uncomplicated appendicitis, **early appendectomy** within 24 hours of diagnosis is recommended to reduce the risk of perforation and complications [^113KpmNN] [^112Kgwyf]. Delaying surgery beyond 24 hours increases the risk of perforation and postoperative complications [^1153k5jP] [^117VCgUZ].

---

### Complicated appendicitis

In complicated appendicitis, **immediate surgery** is indicated for generalized peritonitis or hemodynamic instability [^notfound]. For stable patients with an abscess or phlegmon, initial nonoperative management followed by interval appendectomy is recommended [^115Eoa82] [^115TMznS].

---

## Surgical approach

### Laparoscopic appendectomy

Laparoscopic appendectomy is the **preferred approach** for both uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis due to reduced postoperative pain, shorter hospital stay, and faster recovery [^116YeHKV] [^111sY8Aj]. It is particularly beneficial in obese, elderly, and pediatric patients [^117PmMkS] [^111nzKwK].

---

### Open appendectomy

Open appendectomy is reserved for cases in which laparoscopy is contraindicated or not feasible, such as **extensive adhesions**, **hemodynamic instability**, or **lack of laparoscopic expertise** [^116YeHKV] [^111sY8Aj].

---

## Special considerations

### Pediatric patients

In pediatric patients, **laparoscopic appendectomy** is the preferred approach due to reduced postoperative pain, shorter hospital stay, and faster recovery [^111nzKwK]. Nonoperative management may be considered in selected cases, but surgery remains the standard of care [^113S9FnC].

---

### Elderly patients

In elderly patients, **laparoscopic appendectomy** is recommended due to reduced postoperative complications, shorter hospital stay, and faster recovery [^113StoGK]. Surgery should not be delayed, as elderly patients have a higher risk of perforation and complications [^114JP1wX].

---

### Immunocompromised patients

In immunocompromised patients, **surgical management** is indicated due to the high risk of complications, including perforation and sepsis [^1163ARHT].

---

### Pregnant patients

In pregnant patients, **laparoscopic appendectomy** is safe and recommended, particularly in the second trimester [^115pw2X2]. Surgery should not be delayed, as appendicitis in pregnancy increases the risk of preterm labor and maternal complications [^1163ARHT].

---

## Contraindications to surgery

Absolute contraindications to appendectomy are rare and include **severe comorbidities** that preclude anesthesia or surgery. Relative contraindications include **severe sepsis**, **hemodynamic instability**, or **lack of surgical expertise**. In these cases, initial nonoperative management may be considered [^1119bwvH].

---

## Summary of indications for surgical management

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication for surgery** | **Timing** |
|-|-|-|
| Uncomplicated appendicitis | Definitive treatment, prevent recurrence | Within 24 hours |
| Complicated appendicitis (perforation, abscess, generalized peritonitis) | Control infection, prevent sepsis | Immediate or interval appendectomy |
| Failure of nonoperative management | Persistent symptoms, recurrence | Immediate |
| Pediatric patients | Standard of care, faster recovery | Immediate |
| Elderly patients | Higher risk of complications | Immediate |
| Immunocompromised patients | High risk of complications | Immediate |
| Pregnant patients | Prevent preterm labor, maternal complications | Immediate |

---

Surgical management of appendicitis is indicated for **definitive treatment**, to prevent complications, and to manage recurrence. Early appendectomy within 24 hours is recommended for uncomplicated cases, while complicated cases require immediate or interval surgery. Laparoscopic appendectomy is the preferred approach, and surgery should be individualized for special populations.

Conclusion

Appendectomy is considered the gold standard for treating uncomplicated acute appendicitis. Nevertheless, for a selected subgroup of patients with no risk factors for complicated appendicitis and/or high surgical risk, conservative therapy with antimicrobials may be safe and effective. The decision to treat patients with acute uncomplicated appendicitis must be made on an individual basis and these patients may be followed closely.

### Diagnosis and management of acute appendicitis. EAES consensus development conference 2015 [^115HUxd9]. Surgical Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Unequivocal international guidelines regarding the diagnosis and management of patients with acute appendicitis are lacking. The aim of the consensus meeting 2015 of the EAES was to generate a European guideline based on best available evidence and expert opinions of a panel of EAES members. After a systematic review of the literature by an international group of surgical research fellows, an expert panel with extensive clinical experience in the management of appendicitis discussed statements and recommendations. Statements and recommendations with more than 70% agreement by the experts were selected for a web survey and the consensus meeting of the EAES in Bucharest in June 2015. EAES members and attendees at the EAES meeting in Bucharest could vote on these statements and recommendations. In the case of more than 70% agreement, the statement or recommendation was defined as supported by the scientific community. Results from both the web survey and the consensus meeting in Bucharest are presented as percentages. In total, 46 statements and recommendations were selected for the web survey and consensus meeting. More than 232 members and attendees voted on them. In 41 of 46 statements and recommendations, more than 70% agreement was reached. All 46 statements and recommendations are presented in this paper. They comprise topics regarding the diagnostic work-up, treatment indications, procedural aspects and post-operative care. The consensus meeting produced 46 statements and recommendations on the diagnostic work-up and management of appendicitis. The majority of the EAES members supported these statements. These consensus proceedings provide additional guidance to surgeons and surgical residents providing care to patients with appendicitis.

### Appendectomy versus antibiotic treatment for acute appendicitis [^113ZHYDz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute appendicitis is one of the most common emergency general surgical conditions worldwide. Uncomplicated/simple appendicitis can be treated with appendectomy or antibiotics. Some studies have suggested possible benefits with antibiotics with reduced complications, length of hospital stay, and the number of days off work. However, surgery may improve success of treatment as antibiotic treatment is associated with recurrence and future need for surgery.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated/simple acute appendicitis compared with appendectomy for resolution of symptoms and complications.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trial registers (World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov) on 19 July 2022. We also searched for unpublished studies in conference proceedings together with reference checking and citation search. There were no restrictions on date, publication status, or language of publication.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel-group randomised controlled trials (RCTs) only. We included studies where most participants were adults with uncomplicated/simple appendicitis. Interventions included antibiotics (by any route) compared with appendectomy (open or laparoscopic).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodology expected by Cochrane. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. Primary outcomes included mortality and success of treatment, and secondary outcomes included number of participants requiring appendectomy in the antibiotic group, complications, pain, length of hospital stay, sick leave, malignancy in the antibiotic group, negative appendectomy rate, and quality of life. Success of treatment definitions were heterogeneous although mainly based on resolution of symptoms rather than incorporation of long-term recurrence or need for surgery in the antibiotic group.

Main Results

We included 13 studies in the review covering 1675 participants randomised to antibiotics and 1683 participants randomised to appendectomy. One study was unpublished. All were conducted in secondary care and two studies received pharmaceutical funding. All studies used broad-spectrum antibiotic regimens expected to cover gastrointestinal bacteria. Most studies used predominantly laparoscopic surgery, but some included mainly open procedures. Six studies included adults and children. Almost all studies aimed to exclude participants with complicated appendicitis prior to randomisation, although one study included 12% with perforation. The diagnostic technique was clinical assessment and imaging in most studies. Only one study limited inclusion by sex (male only). Follow-up ranged from hospital admission only to seven years. Certainty of evidence was mainly affected by risk of bias (due to lack of blinding and loss to follow-up) and imprecision. Primary outcomes It is uncertain whether there was any difference in mortality due to the very low-certainty evidence (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 4.95; 1 study, 492 participants). There may be 76 more people per 1000 having unsuccessful treatment in the antibiotic group compared with surgery, which did not reach our predefined level for clinical significance (risk ratio (RR) 0.91, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.96; I² = 69%; 7 studies, 2471 participants; low-certainty evidence). Secondary outcomes At one year, 30.7% (95% CI 24.0 to 37.8; I² = 80%; 9 studies, 1396 participants) of participants in the antibiotic group required appendectomy or, alternatively, more than two-thirds of antibiotic-treated participants avoided surgery in the first year, but the evidence is very uncertain. Regarding complications, it is uncertain whether there is any difference in episodes of Clostridium difficile diarrhoea due to very low-certainty evidence (Peto OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.89; 1 study, 1332 participants). There may be a clinically significant reduction in wound infections with antibiotics (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.68; I² = 16%; 9 studies, 2606 participants; low-certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether antibiotics affect the incidence of intra-abdominal abscess or collection (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.61 to 4.07; I² = 19%; 6 studies, 1831 participants), or reoperation (Peto OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.16; 1 study, 492 participants) due to very low-certainty evidence, mainly due to rare events causing imprecision and risk of bias. It is uncertain if antibiotics prolonged length of hospital stay by half a day due to the very low-certainty evidence (MD 0.54, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.01; I² = 97%; 11 studies, 3192 participants). The incidence of malignancy was 0.3% (95% CI 0 to 1.5; 5 studies, 403 participants) in the antibiotic group although follow-up was variable. Antibiotics probably increased the number of negative appendectomies at surgery (RR 3.16, 95% CI 1.54 to 6.49; I² = 17%; 5 studies, 707 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotics may be associated with higher rates of unsuccessful treatment for 76 per 1000 people, although differences may not be clinically significant. It is uncertain if antibiotics increase length of hospital stay by half a day. Antibiotics may reduce wound infections. A third of the participants initially treated with antibiotics required subsequent appendectomy or two-thirds avoided surgery within one year, but the evidence is very uncertain. There were too few data from the included studies to comment on major complications.

### Should ambulatory appendectomy become the standard treatment for acute appendicitis? [^115cGD8T]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute appendicitis is the most common indication for emergency surgery worldwide, with a lifetime risk of 8.6% for men and 6.7% for women. Despite the promotion of antibiotic therapy as a non-invasive alternative, laparoscopic appendectomy remains the standard treatment for acute appendicitis. It is a common surgery, performed mostly in young healthy patients, with standardized management, operating time under 1 h, low morbidity, and low average length of hospital stay, all of which render it safe to perform in ambulatory settings. Over the past decades, appendectomy has been increasingly performed as 'short stay' (< 24 h hospital stay) or 'ambulatory' (no overnight hospital stay) procedures, with satisfactory outcomes and low complication rates. Yet, conventional hospitalization (with overnight stay) remains the routine procedure for acute appendicitis.

There is no present consensus on the selection of patients with acute appendicitis for ambulatory surgery (AS). Recently, Lefrançois et al. proposed a new score, which classifies patients into 6 risk levels, to select patients for ambulatory appendectomy without compromising outcomes. In their series, only 20% were discharged on the same day of surgery. The percentage of appendectomy procedures performed in ambulatory settings reported in the literature varies greatly (20–88%), likely due to inconsistent definitions of AS and to different criteria for enrollment of ambulatory patients.

For over 5 years, the authors have been performing ambulatory surgery for increasingly complex procedures, including colectomy, and have implemented a standardized care protocol for appendectomy following the guidelines of AS for common elective procedures. The primary goal of the present study was to evaluate a consecutive series of appendectomies, complicated and uncomplicated, performed at our center and compare characteristics and outcomes of patients operated in ambulatory vs. conventional settings. The secondary goal was to investigate factors associated with unexpected re-consultations and re-hospitalizations, and thereby improve patient selection for ambulatory appendectomy.

### A new adult appendicitis score improves diagnostic accuracy of acute appendicitis – a prospective study [^113xeKxD]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute appendicitis is the most common indication for emergency surgery worldwide, with incidence of 1.17 per 1000 and lifetime risk of 8.6% in men and 6.7% in women. The incidence is highest in adolescents and young adults, but the incidence of complicated appendicitis shows little variance between different age groups.

Although a very common and long-known phenomenon, appendicitis remains a diagnostic challenge for surgeons and emergency physicians. Clinical diagnosis alone leads to a negative appendectomy rate of 15 to 30%. The diagnosis is specially challenging for women of fertile age.

Early surgical intervention is the traditional gold standard for preventing appendicular perforation. High rate of unnecessary negative appendectomies, however, leads to unnecessary morbidity and even mortality.

The frequent use of computed tomography (CT) with its high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosis of appendicitis has helped to reduce the number of negative appendectomies. Preoperative CT seems to benefit most women 45 years of age and younger. The use of CT may, however, delay appendectomy in clinically typical cases of acute appendicitis, and therefore even elevate the risk for perforation. Increased use of CT is associated with elevated risk of cancer especially in young patients, whose incidence of acute appendicitis is greatest.

### Safety and efficacy of antibiotics compared with appendicectomy for treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^117MPm9P]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Appendicectomy has been the mainstay for the treatment for acute appendicitis since it was first reported by McBurney in 1889, and the general assumption since the 19th century has been that in the absence of surgical intervention the disease often progresses from uncomplicated to perforated appendicitis. The advent of laparoscopic surgery and the low threshold for operative intervention have led to a risk of high negative appendicectomy rates with unnecessary surgery related morbidity. Only 20% of patients present with complicated appendicitis, and non-operative management with antibiotics and supportive treatment has been explored as a therapeutic option for patients with early uncomplicated appendicitis, with resolution in most of them. Antibiotic treatment was often considered as a bridge to surgery in patients with suspected appendicitis but no clear indications for appendicectomy such as signs of perforation or peritonitis. However, the routine use of antibiotics in patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis was not well supported, owing to inherent pitfalls in the quality and design of individual studies. The role of antibiotic treatment in acute uncomplicated appendicitis may have been overlooked mainly on the basis of tradition rather than evidence, considering that other intra-abdominal inflammatory processes such as colonic diverticulitis are primarily managed non-operatively.

This time honoured practice has been challenged recently with reports of less morbidity associated with antibiotic treatment than surgery in uncomplicated acute appendicitis. With the availability of diagnostic modalities such as computed tomography and ultrasonography, the small group of patients presenting with complicated appendicitis can be identified. Furthermore, epidemiological studies suggest that despite the increasing trend for surgical exploration for suspected appendicitis over the years, the incidence of perforated appendicitis has been similar across all age groups. However, the management of the large majority with uncomplicated appendicitis warrants further evaluation.

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the trials, including a Cochrane review comparing antibiotic treatment and appendicectomy, published in recent years summarised the evidence as either in favour of antibiotic treatment or inconclusive. This could possibly result from inclusion of trials with poor methods or retracted since publication, or from simplifying the evidence as a summary of both randomised and non-randomised studies. The meta-analysis presented here provides a valid and up to date summary of the relevant literature, including a recently published randomised controlled trial of 339 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of uncomplicated appendicitis. It excludes the study that has been retracted subsequent to publication, as well as another for which it was not clear if patients were randomised. The aim of this meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials was to compare antibiotic treatment with appendicectomy for the treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis, with particular reference to safety and efficacy.

### Evolution and current trends in the management of acute appendicitis [^1174987b]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The treatment of appendicitis has evolved since the first appendectomy in the eighteenth century. It seems to have come full circle with nonoperative management in the era before frequent surgical interventions, to open surgical interventions, minimally invasive interventions, and now back to a renewed interest in nonoperative management of acute appendicitis. Scoring systems to help refine the diagnosis of acute appendicitis and advances in medical imaging have also changed the management of this condition. Scientific investigations into the effects the microbiome of the appendix plays in this disease process are also being considered.

### Risk of perforation increases with delay in recognition and surgery for acute appendicitis [^1153k5jP]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Appendicitis remains a common indication for urgent surgical intervention in the United States, and early appendectomy has long been advocated to mitigate the risk of appendiceal perforation. To better quantify the risk of perforation associated with delayed operative timing, this study examines the impact of length of inpatient stay preceding surgery on rates of perforated appendicitis in both adults and children.

Methods

This study was a cross-sectional analysis using the National Inpatient Sample and Kids' Inpatient Database from 1988–2008. We selected patients with a discharge diagnosis of acute appendicitis (perforated or nonperforated) and receiving appendectomy within 7 d after admission. Patients electively admitted or receiving drainage procedures before appendectomy were excluded. We analyzed perforation rates as a function of both age and length of inpatient hospitalization before appendectomy.

Results

Of 683,590 patients with a discharge diagnosis of appendicitis, 30.3% were recorded as perforated. Over 80% of patients underwent appendectomy on the day of admission, approximately 18% of operations were performed on hospital days 2–4, and later operations accounted for < 1% of cases. During appendectomy on the day of admission, the perforation rate was 28.8%; this increased to 33.3% for surgeries on hospital day 2 and 78.8% by hospital day 8 (P < 0.001). Adjusted for patient, procedure, and hospital characteristics, odds of perforation increased from 1.20 for adults and 1.08 for children on hospital day 2 to 4.76 for adults and 15.42 for children by hospital day 8 (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Greater inpatient delay before appendectomy is associated with increased perforation rates for children and adults within this population-based study. These findings align with previous studies and with the conventional progressive pathophysiologic appendicitis model. Randomized prospective studies are needed to determine which patients benefit from nonoperative versus surgically aggressive management strategies for acute appendicitis.

### Antibiotics alone versus appendectomy to treat uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adults: what do meta-analyses say? [^111M8U8b]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Primary appendectomy is the current standard of care for treating uncomplicated acute appendicitis, but interest in conservative treatment with antibiotics alone has been increasing in recent years. Clinical trials so far have shown controversial results.

Methods

A series of meta-analyses were reviewed. Studies comparing surgery versus antibiotics alone for treating uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adults were included. Descriptive statistics and data on treatment effects were retrieved and summarized.

Results

The conservative approach has a success rate of around 60% and is associated with shorter pain duration, reduced analgesic medication, faster resolution of the inflammation process, lower expenses and quicker return to work. On the other hand, medical treatment leads to high (up to 20%) readmission rates and more often requires surgery. An operative approach is associated with higher treatment success rates (> 90%) and very a low mortality rate.

Conclusion

Based on the current body of evidence, the use of antibiotics for primary treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis cannot be routinely recommended. Appendectomy remains the gold-standard treatment.

### SAGES guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis [^115TMznS]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Appendicitis is an extremely common disease with a variety of medical and surgical treatment approaches. A multidisciplinary expert panel was convened to develop evidence-based recommendations to support clinicians and patients in decisions regarding the diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted from 2010 to 2022 to answer 8 key questions relating to the diagnosis of appendicitis, operative or nonoperative management, and specific technical and post-operative issues for appendectomy. The results of this systematic review were then presented to a panel of adult and pediatric surgeons. Evidence-based recommendations were formulated using the GRADE methodology by subject experts.

Results

Conditional recommendations were made in favor of uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis being managed operatively, either delayed (> 12h) or immediate operation (< 12h), either suction and lavage or suction alone, no routine drain placement, treatment with short-term antibiotics postoperatively for complicated appendicitis, and complicated appendicitis previously treated nonoperatively undergoing interval appendectomy. A conditional recommendation signals that the benefits of adhering to a recommendation probably outweigh the harms although it does also indicate uncertainty.

Conclusions

These recommendations should provide guidance with regard to current controversies in appendicitis. The panel also highlighted future research opportunities where the evidence base can be strengthened.

### SAGES guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis [^117NUhTg]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). High credibility.

SAGES guideline — introduction and scope describes that the purpose is to provide evidence-based recommendations from a surgeon and patient perspective pertaining to appendicitis, and states that recommendations are based on a systematic review of the published literature. The review evaluated outcomes of abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan versus alternative imaging for diagnosis of acute appendicitis, operative versus nonoperative treatment of uncomplicated and complicated acute appendicitis, interval appendectomy versus observation for complicated acute appendicitis, late or early appendectomy in uncomplicated appendicitis, short- or long-term antibiotic treatment after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis, and intraoperative decisions during appendectomy for complicated appendicitis: suction and lavage versus suction alone and routine drain placement versus no drain placement. The key target audience includes adult and pediatric surgeons, patients, hospitalists, emergency medicine physicians, primary care physicians, and pediatricians in a clinical setting, and given that a patient-surgeon perspective was taken, not a population perspective, considerations such as cost effectiveness from a systems-standpoint were not evaluated. Appendicitis is described as one of the most common indications for surgery in both adult and pediatric patients, with a lifetime incidence of 6.7–8.6%, with diagnosis typically determined by clinical assessment including history and physical exam as well as imaging, and the ideal imaging modality for accurate diagnosis, distinguishing between acute and complicated appendicitis, and optimal resource utilization has not yet been determined. While appendectomy has traditionally been the mainstay of treatment, the past decade has witnessed increased popularity of non-operative management in both acute and complicated appendicitis, the necessity of interval appendectomy has also been debated, and operative technique and post-operative antibiotic duration for complicated appendicitis are noted as areas of active research.

### Antibiotics alone versus appendectomy to treat uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adults: what do meta-analyses say? [^1153evpy]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute appendicitis is the most common cause of inflammatory acute abdomen. The incidence of acute appendicitis varies from 250,000 to 280,000 cases per year in the United States, which accounts for more than 1 million hospital days per year and a cost of more than 3 billion dollars. For more than a century, acute appendicitis has been treated by surgery, i.e. appendectomy, with mortality rates as low as 0.07 to 0.7%. Nevertheless, surgical intervention is associated with greater pain, adherence and hernia development, ileus, venous thromboembolic events, cardiopulmonary complications and increased costs.

During the 1950s, an initial non-operative approach for acute appendicitis was attempted, but it was not generally accepted at the time. Appendicitis complicated by appendicular abscess/phlegmon may be managed with antibiotics and non-operative strategies with reduced complication rates compared to surgery, like other acute inflammatory intestinal conditions – i.e. diverticulitis and enterocolitis. In this sense, antibiotic therapy may be associated with reduced costs of treatment, avoiding operation and its consequent complications. However, the use of antibiotics alone as primary therapy for uncomplicated acute appendicitis is still being assessed, and studies have shown conflicting results so far.

The aim of this study is to review available meta-analyses comparing antibiotics alone versus appendectomy for uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adults.

### Acute appendicitis during pregnancy: different from the nonpregnant state? [^113A1yVL]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute appendicitis is the most common nonobstetric indication for surgical intervention during pregnancy. However, the current literature is scarce and composed of relatively small case series. We aimed to compare the presentation, management, and surgical outcomes of presumed acute appendicitis between a contemporary cohort of pregnant women and nonpregnant women of reproductive age.

Methods

The study group included 92 pregnant patients who underwent appendectomy for presumed acute appendicitis at a single tertiary medical center in 2000–2014. Preoperative, operative, and postoperative clinical data were derived from medical records and compared to data for 494 nonpregnant patients of reproductive age who underwent appendectomy in 2004–2007 at the same institution.

Results

Median age was 28 years (range 25–33) in the study group and 26 years (range 20–34) in the control group (P = 0.1). There were no between-group differences in mean white blood cell count, patient interval, hospital interval, or operative time. Preoperative abdominal ultrasound was used in a significantly higher proportion of patients in the pregnant group than in the nonpregnant group (73 and 27%, respectively, P < 0.001) and computed tomography, in a significantly lower proportion of patients (1 vs. 16%, respectively, P < 0.001). The two groups had similar rates of negative appendectomy (23 and 22%, P = 0.9), complicated appendicitis (12 and 11%, P = 0.9), and overall postoperative complications (15 and 12%, P = 0.3).

Conclusions

The clinical presentation and outcome of presumed acute appendicitis are similar in pregnant women and nonpregnant women of reproductive age. Therefore, similar perioperative management algorithms may be applied in both patient populations.

### Emergency laparoscopy – current best practice [^114p2nr6]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Emergency laparoscopic surgery allows both the evaluation of acute abdominal pain and the treatment of many common acute abdominal disorders. This review critically evaluates the current evidence base for the use of laparoscopy, both diagnostic and interventional, in the emergency abdomen, and provides guidance for surgeons as to current best practise. Laparoscopic surgery is firmly established as the best intervention in acute appendicitis, acute cholecystitis and most gynaecological emergencies but requires further randomised controlled trials to definitively establish its role in other conditions.

### The impact of timing on outcomes in appendicectomy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116SqNqv]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Appendicitis remains a prevalent surgical emergency worldwide, necessitating prompt intervention to mitigate the risk of complications. Appendicectomy is widely considered the gold standard treatment of acute appendicitis. While the urgency of surgical intervention is widely acknowledged, the optimal timing of appendicectomy remains a subject of ongoing debate within the surgical community. In recent years, evidence has suggested that the timing of appendicectomy may play a crucial role in determining patient outcomes, influencing factors such as postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, and overall recovery.

A recent randomised control trial (RCT) by Jalava et al. found that the rate of appendiceal perforation when surgery was performed within 24 h was comparable to that performed within 8 h. However, there is a general consensus that delaying surgery is associated with worse outcomes and inferior outcomes have been reported when surgery is performed more than 24 h after hospital presentation. Current guidelines recommend performing appendicectomy as soon as possible or within 24 h but there are no large-scale randomised studies which have informed these recommendations. Therefore, it is unclear the exact timeframe in which surgery should be performed in acute appendicitis to obtain preferable outcomes.

Nevertheless, the landscape of appendicitis management continues to evolve, and this review intends to integrate recent evidence to inform contemporary clinical practice. By synthesising data from a diverse range of studies, we seek to elucidate the relationships between timing of appendicectomy and clinical outcomes. The nuanced interplay between timing and outcomes is a critical aspect that warrants careful examination. By employing a network meta-analysis approach, we aim to compare different timeframes for appendicectomy and discern their relative efficacy. Furthermore, we wish to determine whether appendicectomy in the evening and night time has an impact on outcomes when compared with surgery during the daytime.

In conclusion, we aimed to perform a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) to determine the impact which the timing of appendicectomy has on clinical outcomes. By consolidating the available evidence, we strived to contribute to the ongoing discourse surrounding optimal appendicitis management, providing clinicians with evidence-based insights to guide decision-making and enhance patient care.

### WSES consensus conference: guidelines for first-line management of intra-abdominal infections [^112EmDkF]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Acute Appendicitis

Acute appendicitis is the most common intra-abdominal condition requiring emergency surgery.

The Surgical Infection Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America have generated guidelines for the management and treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections on 2010.

Operative intervention for acute, non-perforated appendicitis is the treatment of choice. Non-operative management of patients with acute, non-perforated appendicitis can be considered if there is a marked improvement in the patient's condition prior to operation (Recommendation 1 A).

Antibiotic treatment has been shown to be effective in treating selected patients with acute appendicitis. Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have compared the efficacy of antibiotic therapy alone with that of surgery for acute appendicitis. A meta-analysis of these RCTs concluded that while antibiotics may be useful as primary treatment for selected patients, antibiotics are unlikely to replace appendectomy at present. Selection bias and crossover to surgery in the RCTs suggest that appendectomy is still the gold standard therapy for acute appendicitis. A support for a less emergent approach comes from clinical trials analyzing time to perforation, which indicate this to be an unusual early event.

Both open and laparoscopic approaches to appendectomy are appropriate (Recommendation 1 A).

A systematic review that included 45 randomized trials compared the diagnostic and therapeutic effects of laparoscopic and conventional open appendectomy in the treatment of suspected acute appendicitis. The most consistent findings were an approximately 50% reduction in wound infections but a threefold increase in intra-abdominal abscesses in the laparoscopic appendectomy group. However, subsequently, two large studies have shown that patients undergoing a laparoscopic technique were more likely to be readmitted within 28 days of surgery and that the risk for a complication was higher in the laparoscopic appendectomy group with uncomplicated appendicitis. Taken together, open appendectomy may be preferred, although laparoscopic appendectomy is useful in selected subgroups of patients. Use of either approach should be decided by the surgeon's expertise. The laparoscopic approach is useful for obese patients, elderly patients and patients whose diagnosis is uncertain, especially women of childbearing age.

Statement 9. In elderly patients operated for acute appendicitis, there are no clinical evidences about advantages in the use of linear stapler against other methods (endoloops, clips) for stump closure; we suggest the use of the preferred technique based on local expertise and availability (Conditional recommendation, moderate quality evidences.
10 In elderly patients operated for acute appendicitis is the routine placement of a drainage justified?

The use of abdominal drainage after surgical intervention is a controversial matter of debate; it is historically and generally adopted in abdominal sepsis with diffuse peritonitis.

No study dedicated to elderly patients exists; for general population Allemann and colleagues demonstrated, in a case match study on patients with complicated acute appendicitis, that the routine use of drainage was associated with longer LOS and higher complication rate, with similar abdominal abscess rate. Similar findings were confirmed in a meta-analysis of randomised studies: The use of drainage was associated with higher mortality and higher length of stay with similar intra-peritoneal abscess or wound infection rates; all of the included trials were of very low quality and the derived evidences should not allow any solid recommendation. The choice of positioning a drainage after an operation remains an issue of great variability among surgeons, and dedicated and well-designed studies are needed to better analyse the problem. In light of the absence of specific evidences dedicated to elderly patients and of the low quality of the existing evidences about general (adult and paediatric) population, based on the discussion from the panel of experts, in elderly patients, we suggest the use of drainage only in patients with complicated acute appendicitis.

Statement 10. In elderly patient, we suggest the positioning of an abdominal drainage in case of complicated (with perforation/abscess/peritonitis) appendicitis (Conditional recommendation, very low quality evidences).
11 Does the timing of appendectomy play an important role in elderly patients with acute appendicitis?

The introduction of the conservative treatment as an option for acute appendicitis has raised the question about the timing of surgery and the possible role of delay of surgery. Moreover, not all the hospitals have the availability of an operating room 24/7. From one hand, the initial conservative treatment could decrease the negative explorations rate; from the other, according to some authors, could lead to a delay of surgical treatment of misdiagnosed free perforated appendicitis and consequently to worse outcomes, especially in elderly patients, where diagnosis is more difficult and perforation rate is higher when compared with children and adult population.

### The current management of acute uncomplicated appendicitis: should there be a change in paradigm? A systematic review of the literatures and analysis of treatment performance [^115Hfe3A]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

NOM is definitely a feasible and effective alternative for uncomplicated appendicitis. The majority of patients primarily treated with NOM would be spared from post-operative pain, surgical risks and wound complications. The paradigm remains unchanged, however, that appendectomy should be the gold standard of treatment given its higher treatment success rate and shorter hospital stay. Current evidence in the literature mainly focused on comparing NOM with open appendectomy. With widespread adoption of the laparoscopic approach, high quality evidence is still needed in the comparison of primary laparoscopic appendectomy and NOM. Studies evaluating factors that could affect the rate of success in NOM is needed for clinical reference and to tailor treatment on an individual basis. Until then, patients should be well informed of the available treatment options, their pros and cons, so as to make informed decision and benefit from the optimal treatment.

### Current management of acute appendicitis in adults: what you need to know [^1163ARHT]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Acute appendicitis is one of the most common acute surgical diseases in the world today. Acute appendicitis can present with a well-recognized clinical presentation with abdominal pain which localize in the right lower quadrant. This presentation is more typical in men than in women of child baring age. Several clinical and laboratory calculations can be used to increase the likelihood of making a correct diagnosis. Various imaging modalities can be used to make the diagnosis which include ultrasound, computer tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Each study has well known sensitivity/specificity of positive predictive value of making the diagnosis of appendicitis. The management of acute appendicitis is based on the presentation of the patient and dividing it into uncomplicated and complicated disease. Each requires management with antibiotics and followed with timely appendectomy. Recent studies have demonstrated nonoperative management of uncomplicated appendicitis without no fecalith that can be managed with antibiotics alone. Complicated acute appendicitis should undergo timely surgical intervention. Patients presenting with a large appendiceal abscess or phlegmon should undergo percutaneous drainage and antibiotic management. There are certain patient populations that should be considered for surgical intervention. Pregnant patients as well as immunosuppressed patients should undergo timely surgical intervention to decrease the risk of complications. This review outlines the current principles of the diagnosis, imaging, and treatment of acute appendicitis based on the best available evidence of acute appendicitis in adults.

Appendicitis is a common diagnosis in children being evaluated in the emergency department. After diagnosis, standard treatment has been surgical appendectomy; however, in recent years there is a growing body of evidence evaluating the possibility of nonoperative management in both children and adults. This review will present the current state of the pediatric literature that suggests patients may be successfully treated with antibiotics alone (ie, without surgery), but that a proportion of these patients will have recurrent appendicitis. Given that the literature regarding the option of antibiotic-only management compared with surgery is not yet definitive, there are many factors for providers to discuss with families and patients when considering treatment for acute appendicitis.

DISCUSSION

The role of conservative antibiotic treatment for initial management of acute uncomplicated appendicitis is an area of continued controversy. Because of evidence gaps, it has not generally been concluded that antibiotic treatment should routinely replace surgery. These gaps include few data outside healthy young adults, limited comparison with laparoscopic surgery, and incomplete assessment of patient-related and long-term outcomes. Meta-analyses have found conservative treatment associated with similar or fewer complications overall compared with surgery, – and a recent guideline now acknowledges that this management can be successful for selected patients who wish to avoid surgery and accept the possibility of recurrence. However, guidance does not exist to best advise patients and provide this care. This systematic review describes the patient selection criteria and range of medical treatments used in published trial methods of conservative antibiotic management of acute uncomplicated appendicitis. While RCT (level II; RCTs with some negative criteria) evidence of comparative effectiveness of conservative treatment in relation to urgent appendectomy exists, the full body of experience includes other prospective and retrospective, comparative and noncomparative trials. In total, our search found 34 studies describing 2,944 antibiotic-treated participants. For patients, this summary facilitates discussion about the extent to which their clinical profile is supported by trial experience and what they should expect should they choose nonoperative treatment. For providers, this review identifies common patterns of specific care components in order to guide their management.

### Diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis: systematic review and meta-analysis [^117K3j2T]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). High credibility.

Appendicitis management — uncomplicated versus complicated cases involves differing strategies, with multicenter trials such as the Appendicitis acuta (APPAC) trial reporting antibiotic only treatment to be safe and effective in adults with first episode uncomplicated appendicitis and similar, albeit more limited, data in children; while approximately 90% of patients in these studies were able to avoid initial surgery for uncomplicated appendicitis, recurrence was estimated to be roughly 20–30% at 5-year follow-up, so it is commonly suggested that treatment options should be presented to the patient, allowing for shared decision-making. Patients with complicated appendicitis are often treated based on clinical presentation, with some trialed on antibiotic treatment while others undergo immediate surgical intervention; if treated nonoperatively, many surgeons recommend interval appendectomy, but approaches vary and are not universally agreed upon. Operative approach and post-operative management also vary, with questions persisting regarding timing of operation, drain placement during surgery for complicated appendicitis, suction versus suction and lavage for perforated appendicitis, and the duration of postoperative antibiotics; because treatment can be drastically different between uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis, selecting the optimal imaging modality to differentiate between them is critical.

Timing

Determining the best moment to perform surgery in case of acute appendicitis is of crucial importance. Acute appendicitis has been considered to be an irreversible progressive disease although recent studies have questioned this dogma. Nowadays, the idea is endorsed that two types of appendicitis exist: uncomplicated (non-perforating) and complicated (perforating) appendicitis. The aetiology and pathogenesis of acute appendicitis remain largely unknown. Predicting a mild or fulminant course of appendicitis is not possible. Delaying an appendectomy increases the risk of perforated appendicitis, which is associated with higher incidence of short and long-term morbidity. Hence, it is recommended to perform appendectomy as soon as possible. Although it should be noted that some studies have revealed that the clinical outcome was not affected by time to surgery (when surgery was performed within 12 h after presentation at the emergency department).

### Is it possible to predict the severity of acute appendicitis? Reliability of predictive models based on easily available blood variables [^115bhV6k]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute appendicitis is one of the most frequent indications for emergency surgical admission. Traditionally, the treatment of acute appendicitis has always been surgical appendicectomy, even if there is good evidence that at least some cases of appendicitis can be treated conservatively. The recent Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent guidelines to avoid potentially unnecessary surgery during the peak of the pandemic to reduce the workload of our already strained health systems have taught us that a significant percentage of patients with acute appendicitis can be treated conservatively, thus reducing the risks of a surgical operation. Identifying those patients is not as straightforward as it could seem, and failure of conservative management is still quite high. Generally speaking, the efficacy of conservative management depends on the histologic changes of the appendix, being more likely in the early stages of acute appendicitis and in the absence of a faecalith obstructing the lumen of the appendix. However, it is quite difficult to predict the degree of inflammation of the appendix preoperatively, and CT scan has gained popularity as a diagnostic and prognostic tool for acute appendicitis. Unfortunately, CT is not the ideal screening test, as it is expensive and carries a low but discrete risk of radiation-related morbidity. Furthermore, any diagnosis based on single laboratory tests is not as specific as we would need to differentiate complicated vs non-complicated appendicitis and is associated with a non-insignificant risk of false positive. With this study, we tried to build up a predictive model to stratify preoperatively patients with a diagnosis of acute appendicitis to identify those with advanced (or complicated) disease based on easily available laboratory variables.

Discussion

This EAES consensus development conference regarding the diagnosis and management of acute appendicitis resulted in 46 statements and recommendations based upon the available evidence. Results from this meeting led to this paper, which can be used as a guideline for surgeons treating patients with appendicitis. Local guidelines, national guidelines and guidelines from scientific communities regarding appendicitis were available but showed great heterogeneity. With this consensus meeting, we managed to gather experts from different European nations to compare and debate management of patients with acute appendicitis. This led to a consensus meeting in which 41 of the 46 statements and the majority of the members of the EAES supported recommendations. The transfer of knowledge between the member countries, the opportunity to discuss views and above all, the creation of a widely supported paper appears valuable.

Our list of topics was created by the coordinating team and expert panel and was thought to cover the most important topics in the field of acute appendicitis. Despite local differences, the general idea within the consensus group on the management of patients with acute appendicitis was comparable. In some cases, differences of treatment strategies between members of the expert panel were due to available surgical supplies and finances. This is reflected for instance on the statements and recommendations regarding SILS and MRI. However, we want to emphasize that in defining statements we refrained from stating specific procedures. We rather stated the general principles to follow. In this way, the results from this consensus guideline can also be applied in areas with limited resources.

### Global attitudes in the management of acute appendicitis during COVID-19 pandemic: ACIE appy study [^1167Nraa]. The British Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Surgical strategies are being adapted to face the COVID-19 pandemic. Recommendations on the management of acute appendicitis have been based on expert opinion, but very little evidence is available. This study addressed that dearth with a snapshot of worldwide approaches to appendicitis.

Methods

The Association of Italian Surgeons in Europe designed an online survey to assess the current attitude of surgeons globally regarding the management of patients with acute appendicitis during the pandemic. Questions were divided into baseline information, hospital organization and screening, personal protective equipment, management and surgical approach, and patient presentation before versus during the pandemic.

Results

Of 744 answers, 709 (from 66 countries) were complete and were included in the analysis. Most hospitals were treating both patients with and those without COVID. There was variation in screening indications and modality used, with chest X-ray plus molecular testing (PCR) being the commonest (19.8 per cent). Conservative management of complicated and uncomplicated appendicitis was used by 6.6 and 2.4 per cent respectively before, but 23.7 and 5.3 per cent, during the pandemic (both P < 0.001). One-third changed their approach from laparoscopic to open surgery owing to the popular (but evidence-lacking) advice from expert groups during the initial phase of the pandemic. No agreement on how to filter surgical smoke plume during laparoscopy was identified. There was an overall reduction in the number of patients admitted with appendicitis and one-third felt that patients who did present had more severe appendicitis than they usually observe.

Conclusion

Conservative management of mild appendicitis has been possible during the pandemic. The fact that some surgeons switched to open appendicectomy may reflect the poor guidelines that emanated in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2.

### 2013 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^1119bwvH]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Acute appendicitis

The appendectomy remains the treatment of choice for acute appendicitis. Antibiotic therapy is a safe means of primary treatment for patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis, but this conservative approach is less effective in the long-term due to significant recurrence rates. (Recommendation 1A).

Although the standard treatment for acute appendicitis has historically been the appendectomy, the medical community has recently seen a notable increase in the use of antibiotic therapy as a primary means of treatment.

Several meta-analyses have been published overviewing a series of randomized trials comparing antibiotic therapy to appendectomies for acute uncomplicated appendicitis (cases without abscesses or phlegmon).

Although non-operative, antibioitic-mediated treatments of uncomplicated appendicitis are associated with significantly fewer complications, more manageable pain control, and shorter patient sick leave, this conservative approach features high rates of recurrence and is therefore inferior to the traditional appendectomy.

Considering that only a small number of RCTs of poor methodological quality are currently available, well-designed RCTs are required to better assess the effects of an antibiotic-based approach in conservative treatments of uncomplicated acute appendicitis.

Given this controversy, the appendectomy remains the treatment of choice for acute appendicitis. Non-operative antibiotic treatment may be used as an alternative treatment for specific patients for whom surgery is contraindicated.

Both open and laparoscopic appendectomies are viable approaches to surgical treatment of acute appendicitis (Recommendation 1A).

Several randomized trials have compared the diagnostic and therapeutic advantages of laparoscopic and conventional open appendectomies in the treatment of acute appendicitis.

While the trials demonstrated a reduction in wound infections for the laparoscopic appendectomy group, they also exhibited a threefold increase in intra-abdominal abscesses.

### Laparoscopic versus open surgery for suspected appendicitis [^111sY8Aj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The removal of the acute appendix is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures. Open surgery associated with therapeutic efficacy has been the treatment of choice for acute appendicitis. However, in consequence of the evolution of endoscopic surgery, the operation can also be performed with minimally invasive surgery. Due to smaller incisions, the laparoscopic approach may be associated with reduced postoperative pain, reduced wound infection rate, and shorter time until return to normal activity. This is an update of the review published in 2010.

Objectives

To compare the effects of laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) and open appendectomy (OA) with regard to benefits and harms.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE and Embase (9 February 2018). We identified proposed and ongoing studies from World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov and EU Clinical Trials Register (9 February 2018). We handsearched reference lists of identified studies and the congress proceedings of endoscopic surgical societies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing LA versus OA in adults or children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted data. We performed the meta-analyses using Review Manager 5. We calculated the Peto odds ratio (OR) for very rare outcomes, and the mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes (or standardised mean differences (SMD) if researchers used different scales such as quality of life) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used GRADE to rate the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We identified 85 studies involving 9765 participants. Seventy-five trials included 8520 adults and 10 trials included 1245 children. Most studies had risk of bias issues, with attrition bias being the largest source across studies due to incomplete outcome data. In adults, pain intensity on day one was reduced by 0.75 cm on a 10 cm VAS after LA (MD -0.75, 95% CI -1.04 to -0.45; 20 RCTs; 2421 participants; low-quality evidence). Wound infections were less likely after LA (Peto OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.51; 63 RCTs; 7612 participants; moderate-quality evidence), but the incidence of intra-abdominal abscesses was increased following LA (Peto OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.43; 53 RCTs; 6677 participants; moderate-quality evidence). The length of hospital stay was shortened by one day after LA (MD -0.96, 95% CI -1.23 to -0.70; 46 RCTs; 5127 participant; low-quality evidence). The time until return to normal activity occurred five days earlier after LA than after OA (MD -4.97, 95% CI -6.77 to -3.16; 17 RCTs; 1653 participants; low-quality evidence). Two studies showed better quality of life scores following LA, but used different scales, and therefore no pooled estimates were presented. One used the SF-36 questionnaire two weeks after surgery and the other used the Gastro-intestinal Quality of Life Index six weeks and six months after surgery (both low-quality evidence). In children, we found no differences in pain intensity on day one (MD -0.80, 95% CI -1.65 to 0.05; 1 RCT; 61 participants; low-quality evidence), intra-abdominal abscesses after LA (Peto OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.22; 9 RCTs; 1185 participants; low-quality evidence) or time until return to normal activity (MD -0.50, 95% CI -1.30 to 0.30; 1 RCT; 383 participants; moderate-quality evidence). However, wound infections were less likely after LA (Peto OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.42; 10 RCTs; 1245 participants; moderate-quality evidence) and the length of hospital stay was shortened by 0.8 days after LA (MD -0.81, 95% CI -1.01 to -0.62; 6 RCTs; 316 participants; low-quality evidence). Quality of life was not reported in any of the included studies.

Authors' Conclusions

Except for a higher rate of intra-abdominal abscesses after LA in adults, LA showed advantages over OA in pain intensity on day one, wound infections, length of hospital stay and time until return to normal activity in adults. In contrast, LA showed advantages over OA in wound infections and length of hospital stay in children. Two studies reported better quality of life scores in adults. No study reported this outcome in children. However, the quality of evidence ranged from very low to moderate and some of the clinical effects of LA were small and of limited clinical relevance. Future studies with low risk of bias should investigate, in particular, the quality of life in children.

### Methods of conservative antibiotic treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis: a systematic review [^115aFwyy]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute appendicitis is the most common reason for an emergency abdominal surgery, with a lifetime appendectomy risk of 12% for males and 23% for females. Although conservative (i.e. nonoperative) treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis with antibiotics has yet to be routinely recommended over appendectomy, and evidence gaps exist that are being addressed in ongoing trials, this management is becoming increasingly accepted as a reasonable option for patient shared decision-making. In a 2016 guideline, the World Society of Emergency Surgery concluded that antibiotic therapy can be successful in selected patients with uncomplicated appendicitis who wish to avoid surgery (level of evidence 1; grade of recommendation, A). A 2014 survey of Irish surgeons found that about one fifth routinely treat appendicitis nonoperatively. However, little clinical guidance exists for practitioners in terms of how nonoperative treatment is administered so they can best select and inform patients, and provide care to achieve similar efficacy and safety as established in published trials.

Since the mid-1990s, eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have investigated conservative antibiotic treatment in comparison with urgent appendectomy for acute uncomplicated appendicitis. – In 2015, Salminen et al.reported by far the largest RCT, which involved 530 adults, and found fewer complications, 6% initial antibiotic nonresponse and 23% 1-year recurrence rates, and 12 fewer disability days compared with mostly open appendectomy. Meta-analyses that included this trial found conservative treatment associated with similar or fewer total complications as surgery and concluded that it can be offered to patients. –

We report results of a search of all published trials describing the methods of conservative treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis. This systematic review describes specific components of medical management that may affect outcomes including patient selection, imaging, antibiotics, pain and diet management, criteria for antibiotic nonresponse and appendectomy, disposition, and follow-up. We summarize the details of medical management, describe the range of approaches, critically evaluate this management in the context of applicable guidelines and related research, and identify areas of uncertainty.

### Acute appendicitis severity during the early COVID-19 pandemic period [^112NPxNu]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute appendicitis is one of the most common acute surgical conditions. Operative management by appendectomy is the standard treatment, although there is a push towards an antibiotic-first approach in some patient populations. In stable patients with clinical and radiographic evidence of perforated appendicitis, initial medical management with the option of interval appendectomy is also a safe alternative. Preoperative prediction of severity of appendicitis based on clinical, laboratory, and radiographic evidence can vary greatly among individual cases and among interpreting physicians. Definitive disease severity can be assessed by histopathologic assessment of resected tissue.

The early COVID-19 pandemic period was associated with marked changes in the rates of presentation, diagnosis, and management of many non-COVID-19-related illnesses. Emergency department visits, hospital admissions, and surgical emergencies for non-respiratory illnesses decreased during the early pandemic period. Although professional societies encouraged models of healthcare delivery that would limit risk of exposure of both providers and patients to SARS-CoV-2, there is no biologic reason for the incidence of acute surgical conditions to decrease during a respiratory disease pandemic. This raises the concern that patients may have delayed or even avoided seeking medical care due to fear associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Delayed diagnosis of, or medical intervention for, acute appendicitis can lead to perforation and is associated with increased costs, increased complications, and worse clinical outcomes. Considering the uncertainty of the risk of surgery to both patients and treating clinicians, professional societies made recommendations to alter management of diseases such as appendicitis, suggesting antibiotics over surgical management. Therefore, we sought to determine what, if any, impact the early COVID-19 pandemic period (March 6–June 30, 2020) had on the presentation, management, and histopathologic severity of acute appendicitis.

### Treating appendicitis with antibiotics [^111UBaeV]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

A nonsurgical approach using antimicrobial agents has been advocated as the initial treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis. Several studies and meta-analyses explored this approach. Because many of these studies included individuals with resolving appendicitis, their results were biased. Antimicrobials, however, are warranted and needed for the management of surgical high-risk patients with perforated appendicitis and those with localized abscess or phlegmon. Randomized placebo-controlled trials that focus on early identification of complicated acute appendicitis patients needing surgery and that prospectively evaluate the optimal use of antibiotic treatment in patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis are warranted.

Acute appendicitis management guidelines summary

Multiple societies have published guidelines for the diagnosis and management of appendicitis. Notably, a consensus statement was published in Surgical Endoscopy in 2015, and a summary from the World Society of Emergency Surgery was published in the World Journal of Emergency Surgery in 2016. Several other comprehensive guidelines covering imaging recommendations, antimicrobial prophylaxis and duration, laparoscopic versus open surgical approach, and optimal management of perforated appendicitis have been published. This review summarizes and references evidence-based guidelines for appendicitis by stage, as a reference guide for surgeons practicing emergency general surgery.

Key points

Laparoscopic appendectomy is considered the gold standard for acute appendicitis and should be the procedure of choice, except when laparoscopy is contraindicated or not feasible. Studies have demonstrated the laparoscopic approach is equivalent to, or better than, the open technique in most circumstances. Conversion to open may be necessary in technically difficult cases, however. Laparoscopic appendectomy is safe in the obese, elderly patients, pediatric patients and pregnant patient populations, including in the third trimester.

Non-operative therapy is a reasonable approach in uncomplicated acute appendicitis. Patients should be educated that the possibility of recurrence exists. Non-operative therapy may also be considered in some cases of acute appendicitis with phlegmon or abscess. In most other situations, appendectomy is the standard of care.

CT imaging is more reliable that ultrasound for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The use of intravenous contrast may improve the sensitivity of this test and is generally recommended when CT imaging is performed. Exceptions to CT may be pursued in pregnant women and children to minimize exposure to radiation. Ultrasound is preferred for diagnosis in pregnant patients and children. If ultrasound is equivocal, MRI would be the next diagnostic test of choice.

Preoperative antibiotics should be administered as soon as the diagnosis of acute appendicitis is made. There is no indication for postoperative antibiotics in uncomplicated appendicitis. There are also no data supporting improvement in clinical outcomes with any given scoring system for acute appendicitis.

Technical maneuvers, such as peritoneal irrigation, variations in appendiceal stump closure or methods of mesenteric vascular control have demonstrated no difference in outcomes.

Statement 6.1 Non-operative management is a reasonable first-line treatment for appendicitis with phlegmon or abscess. Percutaneous drainage as an adjunct to antibiotics, if accessible, could be beneficial, although there is a lack of evidence for its use on a routine basis. Laparoscopic surgery in experienced hands is a safe and feasible first-line treatment for appendiceal abscess, being associated with fewer readmissions and fewer additional interventions than conservative treatment, with a comparable hospital stay. Recommendation 6.1 We suggest non-operative management with antibiotics and — if available — percutaneous drainage for complicated appendicitis with a periappendicular abscess, in settings where laparoscopic expertise is not available [QoE: Moderate; Strength of recommendation: Weak; 2B].

Statement 6.2 Operative management of acute appendicitis with phlegmon or abscess is a safe alternative to non-operative management in experienced hands and may be associated with shorter LOS, reduced need for readmissions, and fewer additional interventions than conservative treatment. Recommendation 6.2 We suggest the laparoscopic approach as treatment of choice for patients with complicated appendicitis with phlegmon or abscess where advanced laparoscopic expertise is available, with a low threshold for conversion. [QoE: Moderate; Strength of recommendation: Weak; 2B].

Q.6.2: Is interval appendectomy always indicated for patients with acute appendicitis following successful NOM?

The reported rate of recurrence after non-surgical treatment for perforated AA and phlegmon is up to 12%. In order to avoid this quite high chance of recurrence, some authors recommend routine elective interval appendectomy following initial conservative management. However, this procedure is associated with a non-negligible rate of morbidity of 12.4%. The systematic review by Hall et al. including three retrospective studies for a total of 127 cases of non-surgical treatment of appendix mass in children, showed that after successful non-operative treatment the risk of recurrent AA was found to be 20.5%. Overall, the complications reported included SSI, prolonged postoperative ileus, hematoma formation, and small bowel obstruction, but the incidence of any individual complication was not determined.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaSuspected appendicitis-child [^115pxRxU]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute appendicitis represents the most common abdominal surgical urgency/emergency in children. Imaging remains a central tool in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis and has been shown to facilitate management and decrease the rate of negative appendectomies. The initial consideration for imaging in a child with suspected acute appendicitis is based on clinical assessment, which can be facilitated with published scoring systems. The level of clinical risk (low, intermediate, high) and the clinical scenario (suspicion for complication) define the need for imaging and the optimal imaging modality. In some situations, no imaging is required, while in others ultrasound, CT, or MRI may be appropriate. This review frames the presentation of suspected acute appendicitis in terms of the clinical risk and also discusses the unique situations of the equivocal or nondiagnostic initial ultrasound examination and suspected appendicitis with suspicion for complication (eg, bowel obstruction). The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

The patient perspective on both short- and long-term outcomes would be helpful in studies going forward, and these data are required to fully illustrate the risk versus benefit profile. Large database studies may provide some additional insight without the inherent challenges of randomized controlled trials, but these studies have additional sets of limitations which can limit the interpretability and generalizability of conclusions drawn from them.

SAGES guideline — interpretation of recommendation strength specifies that all guideline recommendations were assigned either a "strong" or "conditional" recommendation, with strong recommendations denoted by the words "the guideline panel recommends" and conditional recommendations by "the guideline panel suggests"; a conditional recommendation signals that the benefits of adhering to a recommendation probably outweigh the harms although it does also indicate uncertainty, which may be due to a lack of high-quality evidence or variability in how individual patients value the outcomes of interest.

### SAGES guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis [^1134ZhZZ]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). High credibility.

Discussion — EAES and current review recommendations: Appendectomy remains the gold standard in acute uncomplicated appendicitis, and EAES recommended that diagnostic imaging begin with ultrasound with advanced imaging as needed, suction alone without lavage, no routine use of drains for complicated appendicitis, and no postoperative antibiotics for uncomplicated appendicitis. The current review utilized new evidence showing a relatively high rate of neoplasm in interval appendectomy specimens and therefore recommends eventual appendectomy, particularly in patients over the age of 40 years. While EAES recommended immediate appendectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis, the authors did not find sufficient evidence to confirm this and make a conditional recommendation for either immediate or delayed appendectomy (> 12 hours) depending upon individual patient, surgeon, or logistical factors. For complicated appendicitis, most reviews agree on a shorter postoperative antibiotic course, and the current review recommends keeping duration in the range of 3–5 days to avoid resistance, C. difficile and urinary tract infections with no evidence of added benefit in abscess reduction.

The limitations of this study are typical of retrospective investigation. Out of 185 patients operated, we could not re-contact 33 (17.8%) patients, which may have led us to underestimate the number of minor complications. The strengths of the study include a strict definition of AS rendering comparisons with the literature rigorous, a consecutive series, a multi-operators database, and a large inclusion of patients.

TIMING OF APPENDECTOMY AND RISK OF APPENDICEAL PERFORATION

With early initiation of early empiric intravenous systemic antibiotic therapy for acute uncomplicated appendicitis, appendiceal perforation prior to surgical intervention for uncomplicated appendicitis is now rare. The PERFECT open-label multicenter randomized trial compared appendectomies scheduled within 8 or 24 hours in adult patients (n = 1,803) with predicted uncomplicated acute appendicitis. The appendiceal perforation rate was similar (8% vs. 9%), and no significant differences in complication rates (7% vs. 6%) were found, with no mortality differences noted. A meta-analysis comparison (15 studies, n = 33,596) of daytime versus nighttime appendectomy reported no differences in postoperative mortality or complication rates, but the conversion to laparotomy was almost twofold higher among patients who underwent appendectomy during nighttime. These data support postponing night-time appendectomy to daytime if possible.

### Is it safe to delay appendectomy in adults with acute appendicitis? [^117VCgUZ]. Annals of Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine whether delayed surgical intervention in adult patients with acute appendicitis is safe by correlating the interval from onset of symptoms to operation (total interval) with the degree of pathology and incidence of postoperative complications.

Summary Background Data

Prompt appendectomy has long been the standard of care for acute appendicitis because of the risk of progression to advanced pathology. This time-honored practice has been recently challenged by studies in pediatric patients, which suggested that acute appendicitis can be managed in an elective manner once antibiotic therapy is initiated. No such data are available in adult patients with acute appendicitis.

Methods

A retrospective review of 1081 patients who underwent an appendectomy for acute appendicitis between 1998 and 2004 was conducted. The following parameters were monitored and correlated: demographics, time from onset of symptoms to arrival at the emergency room (patient interval) and from arrival to the emergency room to the operating room (hospital interval), physical, computed tomography (CT scan) and pathologic findings, complications, length of stay, and length of antibiotic treatment. Pathologic state was graded 1 (G1) for acute appendicitis, 2 (G2) for gangrenous acute appendicitis, 3 (G3) for perforation or phlegmon, and 4 (G4) for a periappendicular abscess.

Results

The risk of advanced pathology, defined as a higher pathology grade, increased with the total interval. When this interval was < 12 hours, the risk of developing G1, G2, G3, and G4, was 94%, 0%, 3%, and 3%, respectively. These values changed to 60%, 7%, 27%, and 6%, respectively, when the total interval was 48 to 71 hours and to 54%, 7%, 26%, and 13% for longer than 71 hours. The odds for progressive pathology was 13 times higher for the total interval > 71 hours group compared with total interval < 12 hours (95% confidence interval = 4.7–37.1). Although both prolonged patient and hospital intervals were associated with advanced pathology, prehospital delays were more profoundly related to worsening pathology compared with in-hospital delays (P < 0.001). Advanced pathology was associated with tenderness to palpation beyond the right lower quadrant (P < 0.001), guarding (P < 0.001), rebound (P < 0.001), and CT scan findings of peritoneal fluid (P = 0.01), fecalith (P = 0.01), dilation of the appendix (P < 0.001), and perforation (P < 0.001). Increased length of hospital stay (P < 0.001) and antibiotic treatment (P < 0.001) as well as postoperative complications (P < 0.001) also correlated with progressive pathology.

Conclusion

In adult patients with acute appendicitis, the risk of developing advanced pathology and postoperative complications increases with time; therefore, delayed appendectomy is unsafe. As delays in seeking medical help are difficult to control, prompt appendectomy is mandatory. Because these conclusions are derived from retrospective data, a prospective study is required to confirm their validity.

### Time to appendectomy for acute appendicitis: a systematic review [^112Xzjgn]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal of this systematic review by the American Pediatric Surgical Association Outcomes and Evidence-Based Practice Committee was to develop recommendations regarding time to appendectomy for acute appendicitis in children within the context of preventing adverse events, reducing cost, and optimizing patient/parent satisfaction.

Methods

The committee selected three questions that were addressed by searching MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases for English language articles published between January 1, 1970 and November 3, 2016. Consensus recommendations for each question were made based on the best available evidence for both children and adults.

Results

Based on level 3–4 evidence, appendectomy performed within 24h of admission in patients with acute appendicitis does not appear to be associated with increased perforation rates or other adverse events. Based on level 4 evidence, time from admission to appendectomy within 24h does not increase hospital cost or length of stay (LOS). Data are currently limited to determine an association between the timing of appendectomy and parent/patient satisfaction.

Conclusions

There is a paucity of high-quality evidence in the literature regarding timing of appendectomy for patients with acute appendicitis and its association with adverse events or resource utilization. Based on available evidence, appendectomy performed within the first 24h from presentation is not associated with an increased risk of perforation or adverse outcomes.

Acute appendicitis — non-operative management: We suggest a carbapenem for empiric therapy of patients undergoing non-operative management of acute appendicitis (Grade 2-B). This is based on a systematic review and network meta-analysis including nine RCTs and 12 observational studies totaling 4,551 patients that compared antibiotic regimens using surgery as a common comparator; the surgical procedure had significantly higher one-year treatment success than cephalosporins or beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations (BLICs) but not carbapenems, and carbapenems were associated with fewer treatment-related adverse events.

### Non-operative management of appendicitis in children [^113TtRto]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2018). Low credibility.

While appendicectomy has been considered the mainstay of treatment for children with acute appendicitis for many decades, there has been a great deal of recent interest in non-operative treatment (NOT) with antibiotics alone. Initial results suggest that many children with appendicitis can indeed be safely treated with NOT and can be spared the surgeon's knife. Many as yet unanswered questions remain, however, before NOT can be considered a realistic and reliable alternative to surgery. This review summaries current knowledge and understanding of the role of NOT in children with appendicitis and outlines and discusses the outstanding knowledge gaps.

### C-reactive protein is an independent surgical indication marker for appendicitis: a retrospective study [^114T7Jv1]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The treatment of appendicitis has been primarily managed by surgery. However, for those who present with catarrhalis (inflammation within the mucous membrane), or phlegmonous (inflammation in all layers) appendicitis, initial treatment by non-surgical management has been shown to be safe and effective. A recent prospective multi-center randomized controlled trial showed that acute non-perforated appendicitis can be treated successfully with antibiotics. The risk of recurrent appendicitis after non-surgical treatment is 5% to 37%. Moreover, a routine interval appendectomy after successful non-surgical treatment is not justified and should be abandoned. On the other hand, complicated appendicitis such as gangrenous (necrotic) appendicitis should be treated with emergency surgery. Clinicians must determine the surgical indications after the diagnosis of appendicitis. This study investigated the possibility of a predictive common blood marker for distinguishing surgically indicated gangrenous (necrotic) appendicitis from catarrhalis (within the mucous membrane), or phlegmonous (in all layers) appendicitis.

In clinical practice, the surgical indications for appendicitis are always difficult. In the diagnosis for appendicitis, not for surgical indication, a common blood analysis including white blood cell counts, neutrophil percentage and serum level of CRP has been demonstrated to be important. Some reports indicated that appendicitis is unlikely, when the white blood cells count and CRP value are normal. However, no report has evaluated the role of CRP for surgical indication of appendicitis. This study investigated whether CRP is a surgical indication marker as well as a diagnostic marker for the decision of an emergency operation for acute appendicitis.

Table 3
Summary of the updated 2020 guidelines statements and recommendations

Topic 1: Diagnosis

Q.1.1: What is the value of clinical scoring systems in the management of adult patients with suspected appendicitis? Can they be used as basis for a structured management?

Risk stratification of patients with suspected AA by clinical scoring systems could guide decision-making to reduce admissions, optimize the utility of diagnostic imaging, and prevent negative surgical explorations. Clinical scores alone seem sufficiently sensitive to identify low-risk patients and decrease the need for imaging and negative surgical explorations (such as diagnostic laparoscopy) in patients with suspected AA.

The RCT by Andersson et al. demonstrated that, in low-risk patients, the use of an AIR (Appendicitis Inflammatory Response) score-based algorithm resulted in less imaging (19.2% vs 34.5%, P < 0.001), fewer admissions (29.5% vs 42.8%, P < 0.001), fewer negative explorations (1.6% vs 3.2%, P = 0.030), and fewer surgical operations for non-perforated AA (6.8% vs 9.7%, P = 0.034). Intermediate-risk patients randomized to the imaging and observation strategies had the same proportion of negative appendectomies (6.4% vs 6.7%, P = 0.884), number of hospital admissions, rates of perforation, and length of hospital stay, but routine imaging was associated with an increased proportion of patients treated for AA (53.4% vs 46.3%, P = 0.020).

### Appendicitis… [^116ehZ1E]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

The standard treatment for acute appendicitis involves the surgical removal of the inflamed appendix. This procedure can be performed either through an open incision in the abdomen or using minimally invasive techniques with small incisions and cameras. Surgery is essential to reduce the risk of complications or potential death associated with the rupture of the appendix. Antibiotics may be equally effective in certain cases of non-ruptured appendicitis, but 31% will undergo appendectomy within one year. It is one of the most common and significant causes of sudden abdominal pain. In 2015, approximately 11. 6 million cases of appendicitis were reported, resulting in around 50, 100 deaths worldwide. In the United States, appendicitis is one of the most common causes of sudden abdominal pain requiring surgery. Annually, more than 300, 000 individuals in the United States undergo surgical removal of their appendix.

Management Acute appendicitis is typically managed by surgery. While antibiotics are safe and effective for treating uncomplicated appendicitis, 31% of people had a recurrence within a year and required an eventual appendectomy. Antibiotics are less effective if an appendicolith is present. While 51% of patients who were treated with antibiotics did not need an appendectomy three years after treatment, the cost effectiveness of surgery versus antibiotics is unclear Using antibiotics to prevent potential postoperative complications in emergency appendectomy procedures is recommended, and the antibiotics are effective when given to a person before, during, or after surgery. Surgery The surgical procedure for the removal of the appendix is called an appendectomy. A negative appendectomy constitutes the removal of a normal appendix with no sign of inflammation in histopathology examination. The prevalence of negative appendectomy varies but has been estimated to 13%.

Appendectomy can be performed through open or laparoscopic surgery. Laparoscopic appendectomy has several advantages over open appendectomy as an intervention for acute appendicitis. Open appendectomy For over a century, laparotomy was the standard treatment for acute appendicitis. This procedure consists of the removal of the infected appendix through a single large incision in the lower right area of the abdomen. The incision in a laparotomy is usually 2 to 3 inches long. During an open appendectomy, the person with suspected appendicitis is placed under general anesthesia to keep the muscles completely relaxed and to keep the person unconscious. The incision is two to three inches long, and it is made in the right lower abdomen, several inches above the hip bone. Once the incision opens the abdomen cavity, and the appendix is identified, the surgeon removes the infected tissue and cuts the appendix from the surrounding tissue.

After careful and close inspection of the infected area, and ensuring there are no signs that surrounding tissues are damaged or infected. In case of complicated appendicitis managed by an emergency open appendectomy, abdominal drainage may be inserted, but this may increase the hospital stay. The surgeon will start closing the incision. This means sewing the muscles and using surgical staples or stitches to close the skin up. To prevent infections, the incision is covered with a sterile bandage or surgical adhesive. Laparoscopic appendectomy Laparoscopic appendectomy was introduced in 1983 and has become an increasingly prevalent intervention for acute appendicitis. This surgical procedure consists of making three to four incisions in the abdomen, each 0. 25 to
0. 5 inches long.

### Antibiotics vs appendectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis treatment… [^111vpu3c]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

Interventions Patients randomized to antibiotic therapy received intravenous ertapenem for 3 days followed by 7 days of oral levofloxacin and metronidazole. Patients randomized to the surgical treatment group were assigned to undergo standard open appendectomy. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end point for the surgical intervention was the successful completion of an appendectomy. The primary end point for antibiotic-treated patients was discharge from the hospital without the need for surgery and no recurrent appendicitis during a 1-year follow-up period. Results. There were 273 patients in the surgical group and 257 in the antibiotic group. Of 273 patients in the surgical group, all but 1 underwent successful appendectomy, resulting in a success rate of 99. 6%. In the antibiotic group, 70 patients underwent appendectomy within 1 year of initial presentation for appendicitis. Trial Registration clinicaltrials. gov Identifier: NCT01022567 Appendectomy has been the standard treatment for acute appendicitis for over a century. More than 300 000 appendectomies are performed annually in the United States. 1 Although appendectomy is generally well tolerated, it is a major surgical intervention and can be associated with postoperative morbidity. 2, 3. Quiz Ref IDSince the time Fitz described the relationship between the appendix and pelvic abscess and McBurney demonstrated reduced morbidity from pelvic infections attributable to appendectomy, 4, 5 it has been thought that acute appendicitis invariably progresses to perforation. This line of thinking underlies the belief that emergency appendectomy is required when a diagnosis of appendicitis is made. Fitz's and McBurney's publications4, 5 predated the availability of antibiotics by 40 years.

In the absence of antibiotics, appendectomy saved lives by reducing the risk of uncontrolled pelvic infection when appendicitis was present. More recently, the notion of treating appendicitis with antibiotics was tested in 3 randomized clinical trials7–9. The results from these 3 trials were summarized in a Cochrane analysis10 and several meta-analyses. 11–15 Each of these trials had limitations, and appendectomy remains the standard approach for treating appendicitis. To overcome the limitations of previous trials, we tested the hypothesis that appendicitis can be successfully treated with antibiotics by conducting a multicenter, open-label, noninferiority RCT comparing antibiotic therapy with emergency appendectomy for treating uncomplicated acute appendicitis. All Finnish hospitals with sufficient patient volume agreeing to participate in the study were included. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

17 All patients gave written informed consent to participate in the study. The objective of the APPAC trial was to compare antibiotic therapy with emergency appendectomy in the treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis confirmed by a computed tomographic scan. We tested the hypothesis that antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis was noninferior to appendectomy. Based on prior studies, 13 we assumed that there would be a 24% difference in treatment efficacy between the surgical and antibiotic groups. Open appendectomy was performed using a McBurney right-lower quadrant muscle-splitting incision technique. Some surgeons performed laparoscopic appendectomy. Prophylactic antibiotics were administered approximately 30 minutes before the incision was made. No further antibiotics were given to patients in the surgical group unless a wound infection was suspected postoperatively.
