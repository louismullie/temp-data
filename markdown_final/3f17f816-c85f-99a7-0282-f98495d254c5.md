## Question

my doc says i have a rare condition and recommended a special clinic do i need prior authorization from insurance and how do i get my records over

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether prior authorization is needed for a referral to a special clinic for a rare condition, and how to transfer medical records to that clinic. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the referral itself triggers prior authorization. Then, I should verify what services at the special clinic commonly require prior authorization. Next, I will check how to request and transfer medical records in a HIPAA-compliant way. Finally, I will consider timing, appeals, and special circumstances for rare diseases to minimize delays and denials.

> Let me first confirm the core principle: a referral to a specialist or special clinic alone typically does not require prior authorization, but the specific services ordered at that clinic often do, especially for rare diseases where diagnostics and therapies are high-cost or nonstandard, so I need to be precise about what exactly is being authorized [^1164wDhN] [^11595GS4].

> Wait, let me verify which services at a "special clinic" for a rare condition most commonly need prior authorization. Genetic testing, advanced imaging, biologic or orphan drugs, and certain procedures frequently require PA, and denials are not rare in pediatrics and rare disease settings, so I should anticipate that step and plan early to avoid delays in diagnosis or treatment [^113Lo69U] [^1138F7xr] [^1143Hhhc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm payer-specific rules because prior authorization requirements vary by insurer, plan, and state. Some states and plans have moved to streamline or exempt certain services, but for rare disease care the burden remains high, so I need to check the exact policy for the patient's carrier and product type before scheduling [^1164wDhN] [^115FGEie].

> I will now examine how to get records transferred. The most reliable approach is to sign a HIPAA-compliant authorization form with the originating provider, specifying the receiving clinic and what records to send. Clinics are required to provide records within about 30 days and may charge a reasonable fee, and many systems now support electronic release, which speeds the process [^114ELmeT].

> But wait, what if the special clinic is out-of-network or the records are fragmented across systems? I should double-check that the referral includes a written request for records, and I can also request a copy for myself to hand-carry or upload to a patient portal, which helps avoid gaps and delays in care coordination [^114ELmeT].

> Next, I should review timing and proactive steps. Because prior authorization can add days to weeks, I need to ensure the special clinic submits PA requests as early as possible, ideally before the appointment, and that the packet includes the referring physician's rationale, relevant guidelines, and a clear statement of medical necessity to reduce the chance of denial or requests for more information [^116CW9sJ] [^1123CrQg].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "most referrals to specialists require PA", but I should correct that. Many plans allow direct specialist access without PA for the visit itself, while PA is typically required for the ordered tests, drugs, or procedures, so I need to separate the referral from the services when advising the patient [^1164wDhN].

> I need to ensure we address appeals and equity. If a PA is denied, a peer-to-peer appeal can be effective, and patients with public insurance or from marginalized groups face higher denial rates and longer delays, so I should counsel on advocacy, expedited reviews when clinically indicated, and available patient assistance programs to mitigate harm from delays [^111bmMcb] [^114kyxi1] [^114qPjm8].

> Let me consider special rare disease nuances. Some states and plans have begun to exempt certain rare disease diagnostics or therapies from PA, and professional societies advocate for streamlined access to genome sequencing and orphan drugs, so I should verify whether any such exemptions or fast-track pathways apply to this case and document accordingly [^11595GS4] [^notfound].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the following with the patient: 1) the exact name and address of the special clinic, 2) the specific services anticipated (testing, medications, procedures), 3) the insurer and plan details, and 4) whether the clinic will handle prior authorizations. Then I should initiate the records request now and ask the clinic to start PA early if any high-cost services are planned, while I monitor for denials and prepare appeals as needed [^1164wDhN] [^116CW9sJ].

You **likely need prior authorization** for a referral to a special clinic for a rare condition, as insurers often require it for specialty care, diagnostics, and therapies. Contact your insurance to confirm requirements and start early to avoid delays. For records, **request them from your doctor** using a signed HIPAA release and ask the clinic to request them directly; electronic transfers are fastest, but allow 1–2 weeks and follow up if needed.

---

## Prior authorization for rare condition referrals

- **Common requirement**: Insurers often require prior authorization for specialty referrals, especially for rare diseases that need advanced diagnostics, genetic testing, or specialized therapies [^1164wDhN] [^115FGEie].

- **Varies by plan**: Requirements differ by insurer, plan, and state; some mandate prior authorization for any specialist visit, while others only for specific services or out-of-network care.

- **Start early**: Begin the prior authorization process as soon as your doctor recommends the special clinic to avoid treatment delays [^111BXHiR].

---

## How to obtain prior authorization

- **Contact your insurer**: Call the member services number on your insurance card to confirm whether prior authorization is needed and what documents are required.

- **Obtain documentation**: Ask your doctor for a referral letter, medical records, and any supporting evidence (e.g. test results, specialist notes) to justify the referral.

- **Submit the request**: Your doctor's office typically submits the prior authorization request, but you should follow up to ensure it is received and processed.

- **Track progress**: Monitor the status and be prepared to provide additional information if requested by your insurer.

---

## Transferring medical records to the special clinic

- **HIPAA authorization**: Sign a HIPAA release form authorizing your current doctor to send records to the special clinic.

- **Direct request**: Ask the special clinic to request records directly from your doctor; this is often the most efficient method.

- **Electronic transfer**: Many clinics use secure electronic systems for faster transfer; confirm with both offices.

- **Follow-up**: Allow 1–2 weeks and follow up to ensure records were received and are complete.

### The impact of prior authorization on clinical practice and patient care outcomes: a work group report of the AAAAI prior authorization task force [^1159VJ4s]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). High credibility.

Prior authorization (PA) in United States health care — survey limitations, electronic prior authorization (ePA) barriers, and AAAAI position recommendations — notes ePA limitations including software misfiring, changing PA requirements, and insurance fragmentation and states these systems currently do not reduce the burden on practices or patient care. The survey study reports recall and selection bias and a low response rate, with responses from only approximately 4% of AAAAI membership, limiting generalizability, although respondents were demographically distributed across the United States and the response rate was proportionally greater than a similar AMA survey. The AAAAI position statement recommends improving the transparency of PA, reducing the number of allergy-immunology specialists subject to PA requirements, using guideline-based criteria to improve access to approved biologics, ensuring continuity of care for rare genetic disorders requiring life-saving medications, instituting national electronic standards for PAs, and preventing PAs from leading to delayed access to emergency care medications. The report states that patient and physician advocacy is needed to support legislative initiatives in Congress to address PA reform and that prior authorization is a serious health care problem that wastes financial resources and places patients in danger when they cannot access required medications or services.

### Evaluating the effect of prior authorizations in patients with complex dermatologic conditions [^111jZQkR]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In dermatology, prior authorizations can delay treatment, decrease patient adherence, and deter providers from advocating for their patients. Patients with complex dermatologic conditions, often requiring off-label treatments, may face particularly significant insurance barriers.

Objective

Evaluate the effect of prior authorizations in patients with complex dermatologic conditions.

Methods

This prospective cohort study assessed patients treated by a dermatologist during 5 months who specialized in complex dermatology. Patients included were older than 18 years, treated at V.P.W.'s rheumatology-dermatology clinic, and prescribed a medication or ordered a diagnostic procedure that elicited an insurance prior authorization. Data on prior authorization outcome, administrative time, and delay to treatment were collected.

Results

Of 51 prior authorizations, 51% were initially denied, with systemic medications more likely denied than topical ones (P < .001). Total administrative time spent on 50 prior authorizations tracked was 62.5 hours (median time per prior authorization 30 minutes [interquartile range 17–105 minutes]). Time to access treatment was tracked for 80% of prior authorizations; median delay was 12 days [interquartile range 5.5–23 days].

Limitations

Single-center, single-provider patient panel.

Conclusion

Patients with complex dermatologic conditions face a significant barrier to care because of prior authorizations. The administrative burden for provider practices to address these prior authorizations is substantial and may warrant a streamlined system in collaboration with insurers.

### Patient perspectives on prior authorization for cancer care [^111BXHiR]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Process codes described how the steps of prior authorization, including peer-to-peer review, led to delays in care. For example, "The peer-to-peer appeal process took time away from patient care, and it showed that the person on the insurance side denying was not an oncologist or an expert in my treatment plan" and "The most frustrating prior authorization process took days and multiple professionals to complete for something the insurance cannot legally say no to".

Relating to the health care team, respondents identified the need for teams to begin the process early to mitigate potential delays and denials ("Cancer teams need to get authorization well in advance of the time my oncologist wants scans/MRIs [magnetic resonance imaging]"). Respondents also highlighted the importance of hospital-based support programs for patients who face high out-of-pocket expenses because of insurance denials: "I wish my cancer center would have had better resources to address programs I could use to pay for the chemo my insurance denied. I was able to find the program but not everyone can".

A broken system was an overarching theme that captured patient frustration with the prior authorization process. Patient codes within this theme highlighted the strong emotional response prior authorization elicited from respondents, including feelings of anger, despair, desperation, and disgust (Table 2).

Process codes focused on the profit-seeking nature of the insurance industry and the perception of respondents that insurance companies prioritize financial interest over their health ("It really made me feel like stage IV in the mind of [redacted insurance company] was a death sentence and we were not worth the hit to their bottom line"; "Insurance companies trying to save money is going to cost patients precious time and appropriate care"; and "It is largely part of the business plan of insurers to increase their profits and has little to do with patient well-being").

Table 1.
Sample Demographic Characteristics

Four interconnected themes were created from the initial codes: blinded navigation, intersecting burdens, interference with care, and a broken system. Although overlap exists among the themes in their effect on patients, each theme represents a distinct experience for patients in their views of prior authorization. Table 2 includes illustrative quotations from each theme. Quotations presented are unedited, except for redaction of insurance company names and clarifications of terms and abbreviations, which appear in brackets. Results below demonstrate how each of the code categorizations (patient feelings, prior authorization process, and health care team role) were represented within each theme.

Table 2.
Participant Quotations by Theme

Blinded navigation described the perception that patients felt uncertain and often unsupported during the prior authorization experience. Patient codes included feelings of surprise and confusion (eg, "I was blindsided" and "It came out of nowhere"). Process codes within this theme included patient perception of a lack of adequate communication prior to and during the prior authorization process and regarding the rationale for the prior authorization. Process codes also noted that obtaining preapproval for elements of their care was "stressful and overwhelming" and marked by a lack of transparency ("[N]o one from the insurance company could explain why or would allow my doctor or me to talk with the clinical provider who was denying my PET [positron emission tomography] scan").

This lack of transparency was underscored by codes to characterize what patients perceived as the arbitrary nature of prior authorization. Patients described how prior authorization varied by state and insurance provider ("I moved states, and in the new state my maintenance treatment has been denied") and how it was applied to treatments that did not previously require prior authorization ("I had been on my nausea med[ication] over a year, and all of a sudden, I'm the middle of a round of chemo[therapy], they refused to refill it").

Communication difficulty was a key code in this theme. Several respondents noted that the insurance representative with whom they communicated was unable to make decisions regarding the prior authorization ("Insurance companies don't give any power to the people who answer the phone") and experienced inconsistency in information provided ("Everyone I talked to gave me a different explanation").

### Adverse effects of health plan prior authorization on clinical effectiveness and patient outcomes: a systematic review [^115WCnhz]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Prior authorization requirements by health insurance plans have become a barrier to healthcare delivery in the United States in terms of clinical efficiency, patient and provider experience. Surveyed physicians report associations with care delays, reduced clinical effectiveness and compromised patient outcomes. In this systematic review, we synthesized the published evidence regarding harmful effects of prior authorization on disease management and patient outcomes. Twenty-five studies were included. In addition to care delays, authorization requirements were associated with disease exacerbation, preventable hospitalization, prolonged hospital stay, and lower rates of disease-free survival. Studies spanned multiple specialties including oncology, cardiology, behavioral health and pediatrics. Published evidence shows that prior authorization requirements are associated with measurable patient harm across multiple healthcare domains. Recognizing that a small number of retrospective studies do not adequately quantify the harm, we propose establishing national quality metrics for health plans, using claims data to track longitudinal outcomes in patients subject to delays and denials.

### Patient perspectives on prior authorization for cancer care [^114qPjm8]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Our findings echo the ongoing and growing dissatisfaction with for-profit health insurance companies recently amplified in mainstream media, demonstrating that patients have reached a tipping point in their pain and frustration with prior authorization and other forms of health management utilization. The widespread outrage about prior authorization has led to independent reporting on lucrative third-party contracts to reduce spending on medical procedures, with one company promising a 3-to-1 return on investment. This is mirrored in our findings that patients feel that their lives are being weighed against company profits.

In addition to the patient harm demonstrated in our findings, prior authorization can amplify growing disparities in access and outcomes among patients who have been historically and currently minoritized, marginalized, or excluded. As one respondent noted, "I am in medicine and know how to navigate the system and these issues make me cry and get frustrated very often, I can't imagine how an elderly person or how someone who isn't fluent in English gets by". Navigating prior authorization requires technological savvy, an understanding of insurance processes, knowledge of personal rights, and time to engage in the process. Disparities in health insurance literacy disproportionately affect younger patients, those with lower educational attainment, and patients from minoritized racial and ethnic groups, with lower health insurance literacy being associated with more delayed or foregone care. Additionally, studies on the "time toxicity" of cancer care have demonstrated that the prior authorization process for patients and clinicians takes vital time away from completing other life responsibilities.

### The impact of prior authorization in allergy / immunology: a position statement of the AAAAI [^111HQkMd]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). High credibility.

AAAAI position statement — prior authorization (PA) burden and outcomes in allergy/immunology are quantified by AMA survey data and asthma biologic access findings. In the 2021 AMA Survey of 1004 physicians, 93% of physicians report a delay in care due to the PA process, with 56% stating that this occurs often or always, and 82% reporting that PA can sometimes, often, or always lead to treatment abandonment. Despite 98% of health plans reporting a peer-reviewed, evidence-based process in PA program design, up to 30% of physicians answered that PA criteria are rarely or never evidence based. For asthma care, of the 25 million individuals who have asthma in the United States, 5% to 10% have severe asthma and may benefit from biologic therapy, yet the PA process delayed insurance approval to over 20 days on average and led to 47% of patients with severe asthma requiring additional prednisone therapy during that waiting period. Reported clinical harms include 91% of physicians reporting a negative impact on outcome measures when treatments require a PA, with 34% reporting a serious adverse event; this included 24% reporting hospitalization, 18% reporting a life-threatening event or required intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage, and 8% reporting disability/permanent bodily damage, congenital anomaly/birth defect, or death. Practice workload is high, with an average of 41 PA per physician per week and nearly 2 business days per week spent exclusively on PA; Eighty-eight percent of physicians report this being a high or very high burden, and 40% report having to hire staff to work entirely on this process.

### Guidance on the limits to the number of embryos to transfer: a committee opinion [^111RM4j2]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Embryo transfer practices — documentation, monitoring, and oversight are outlined. On rare occasions, transferring more or fewer embryos than recommended by this document may be justified; documentation of justification for transferring a greater number should be recorded in the medical record with clinical conditions noted. Programs should monitor their results continually and consider decreasing the number of embryos transferred to minimize undesirable outcomes, and a clinic's own data cannot be used to routinely exceed the recommended limits. Programs that have a multiple pregnancy rate well above average for SART-reporting clinics may be audited by SART, and persistent noncompliance may result in expulsion. The number of embryos transferred should be determined by the physician and the patient(s), with informed consents completed and the information recorded in the clinical record.

### The impact of prior authorization on clinical practice and patient care outcomes: a work group report of the AAAAI prior authorization task force [^112pfLNJ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). High credibility.

Prior authorization (PA) impact on clinical care — survey findings report high rates of negative outcomes and delays. The AMA survey in 2021 revealed that 91% of physicians reported a negative impact on outcome measures when treatments required a PA, and 34% reported that the PA process led to a serious adverse event for their patients; 24% stated that the PA process led to a patient's hospitalization. In the 2018 AMA Prior Authorization Physician Survey of 1000 practicing physicians, 65% and 26% of physicians reported waiting, on average at least 1 and 3 business days, respectively, for a response from the health plan, while 91% reported that PA requirements caused delayed access to necessary care and greater than 25% reported that PA procedures had led to a serious adverse event. The authors note that PAs can significantly affect patient care delivery and increase administrative burden to clinical practices, leading to serious adverse events in some circumstances.

### Home health care of children, adolescents and young adults with complex medical needs: clinical report [^113niPj8]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Maintaining ongoing home health care needs in children with medical complexity — Most CMC have chronic conditions associated with complete and irreversible dependence on technology and consequently may require lifelong home health care services. The provision of uninterrupted home health care is threatened by national nursing shortages, limitations in the availability of skilled pediatric nurses, and lack of funding, and pediatric equipment is not universally available. Pediatric health care providers need to provide frequent updates on orders, letters of medical necessity, and prior authorizations, which sometimes require "peer to peer evaluations" with medical staff at the insurance company. Thus, home health care services are carefully monitored and maintained to provide continuous access to children and youth with special health care needs and their families. Transitioning from pediatric to adult care health care providers also requires careful planning, and many families will continue to need home health care support as children age.

### Prior authorization requirements for proprotein convertase subtilisin / kexin type 9 inhibitors across US private and public payers [^1138F7xr]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (PCSK9is) are an innovative treatment option for patients with familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease who require further lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. However, the high costs of these agents have spurred payers to implement utilization management policies to ensure appropriate use. We examined prior authorization (PA) requirements for PCSK9is across private and public US payers.

Methods and Results

We conducted an analysis of 2016 formulary coverage and PA data from a large, proprietary database with information on policies governing > 95% of Americans with prescription drug coverage (275.3 million lives) within 3872 plans across the 4 major insurance segments (commercial, health insurance exchange, Medicare, and Medicaid). The key measures included administrative PA criteria (prescriber specialty, number of criteria in PA policy or number of fields on PA form, requirements for medical record submission, reauthorization requirements) and clinical/diagnostic PA criteria (approved conditions, required laboratories or other tests, required concomitant therapy, step therapy requirements, continuation criteria) for each of 2 Food and Drug Administration-approved PCSK9is. Select measures (eg, number of PA criteria/fields, medical record submission requirements) were obtained for 2 comparator cardiometabolic drugs (ezetimibe and liraglutide). Between 82% and 97% of individuals were enrolled in plans implementing PA for PCSK9is (depending on insurance segment), and one third to two thirds of these enrollees faced PAs restricting PCSK9i prescribing to a specialist. For patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, diagnostic confirmation via genetic testing or meeting minimum clinical scores/criteria was also required. PA requirements were more extensive for PCSK9is as compared with the other cardiometabolic drugs (ie, contained 3×-11× the number of PA criteria or fields on PA forms and more frequently involved the submission of medical records as supporting documentation).

Conclusions

PA requirements for PCSK9is are greater than for selected other drugs within the cardiometabolic disease area, raising concerns about whether payer policies to discourage inappropriate use may also be restricting access to these drugs in patients who need them.

### Oncology trainee perceptions of the prior authorization process: a national survey [^115PGBSE]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

In both the American Medical Association survey and this survey, 92% of participants reported prior authorization-associated delays in patient care. This finding is in line with published data that prior authorizations delayed initiation of radiation therapy by an average of 3 weeks in patients recommended to undergo proton beam therapy. A similar study found that as many as 34% of such patients are initially denied proton treatment, which suggests that the prior authorization process disproportionately affects innovative treatment modalities. This is also observed in the field of medical oncology, where a study evaluating prior authorizations in a high-volume breast-oncology clinic found that 26.5% of all prior authorizations tracked were for palbociclib, a novel therapy for hormone-sensitive breast cancers. Prior authorization denials for these services are likely a major reason why trainees report changes in the recommended treatment plan for these patients up to 75% of the time. This is especially significant because treatment delays have been associated poorer outcomes in multiple cancer types. Further, the efforts of trainees and physicians to perform the prior authorization process are not tracked, credited, or financially reimbursed. This also includes the efforts of dosimetrists and physicists to produce comparison plans for insurance companies to demonstrate the need for more complex radiation techniques.

Trainees do identify several possible avenues for improving the prior authorization process. In this survey, nearly 90% of participants suggested that that insurance reviewers be in the same specialty as the ordering provider, and 75% supported more rapid turnaround times. Physician compensation for time and effort spent on the prior authorization process may disincentivize insurance companies from denying claims based on algorithms or the decision making of physicians who lack training in the relevant field. Oversight to ensure that this compensation is not abused would be required.

Cancer care is generally categorized as nonemergent by insurance companies, with company policy permitting up to weeks for appeal decisions after peer-to-peer discussion, and potentially no option for further discussion during this arbitration period. In a patient population where certain diagnoses can result in a life expectancy of less than a year, up to 10% of that remaining time could potentially be spent waiting for approval to pursue life-extending or life-saving therapies. This can result in high patient and physician concern and selection of less ideal treatments that are approved by insurance providers.

### The impact of prior authorization in allergy / immunology: a position statement of the AAAAI [^114uGkGp]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). High credibility.

Prior authorization in allergy/immunology — burden and renewal frequency indicate that for each patient on a therapy requiring a prior authorization (PA), the allergy/immunology (AI) professional must go through this process at least once per year, and several insurance companies have shortened this period to as little as 3 to 6 months, which may entail PA renewals up to 4 times per year. The AMA Survey highlighted that more than half (51%) of the participants reported that PA has interfered with a patient's ability to perform his or her job responsibilities, and increasing physician burnout has also been tied to the increase in PA requests. In summary, the PA process has led to barriers limiting patient access to appropriate, evidence-based therapies and often leads to suboptimal clinical care.

### Burden with No benefit: prior authorization in congenital cardiology [^114kyxi1]. Pediatric Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Prior authorization is a process that health insurance companies use to determine if a patient's health insurance will cover certain medical treatments, procedures, or medications. Prior authorization requests are common in adult congenital and pediatric cardiology (ACPC) due to need for advanced diagnostics, complex procedures, disease-specific medications, and the heterogeneity of the ACPC population. Prior authorizations in ACPC are rarely denied, but nonetheless, they are often accompanied by significant administrative burden on clinical care teams and delays in patient care. Prior authorizations have been implicated in worsening care inequities. The prior authorization process is insurer specific with differences between commercial and public insurers. Prior authorization rejections were previously found to be more common for women, racial minorities, those with low education, and in low-income groups. Prior authorization unduly burdens routine diagnostics, routine interventional and surgical procedures, and routine cardiac specific medication use in the ACPC population. This manuscript highlights the burdens of prior authorization and advocates for the elimination of prior authorization for ACPC patients.

### Advancing access to genome sequencing for rare genetic disorders: recent progress and call to action [^11595GS4]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Reduce the administrative barriers

To improve access to GS, there is an urgent need to streamline pre-authorization, eliminate co-pays or other out-of-pocket expenses when insurance coverage is present, and simplify administrative procedures. Reducing administrative barriers will not only save time but also alleviate the financial burdens of patients and healthcare providers, ensuring timely access to critical genetic testing services. We note that in the US, the American Medical Association (AMA) is pursuing state-level legislation to streamline appropriate test ordering, and we anticipate similar efforts in other geographies. A comprehensive reduction in administrative burdens, is essential to further improve access to GS testing.

Strive for equitable access from the outset

Equitable access to GS should be prioritized to ensure that all patients, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status, can benefit from a genetic diagnosis and genome-informed care. In the US, Medicaid policies, managed at the state level, must be expanded to enable access to GS in underserved populations. In other geographies, without public funding, access will be limited to patients that can afford to pay out of pocket. The clinical genetics community should work with local governments, the pharmaceutical industry, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and philanthropiists to support in-country capacity building and test subsidization programs.

Continued development of evidence-based guidelines

Continued development of evidence-based guidelines that detail the indications for GS testing and genome-informed treatment are essential to widespread adoption. Guidelines should be developed in collaboration across professional societies to support awareness and utilization beyond medical genetics professionals. Gaps in the evidence should be clearly articulated to enable both academic stakeholders and private industry to develop plans to address them.

Advocate for comprehensive care coordination

It is critical to establish mechanisms for effective care coordination throughout the diagnostic and precision medicine process to maximize patient benefit and constrain costs. This will require improved communication mechanisms across care providers and the development and implementation of infrastructure that supports timely result-sharing and coordinated follow-up for care continuity.

Resource clinician education and training

Expanded continuing education and training programs are needed for healthcare professionals in clinical genomics and genomic medicine. This should include integrating genomics education into medical and allied health curricula and providing ongoing professional development opportunities. Clinical education and training are necessary to address equity of access issues in disadvantaged communities worldwide.

### Guidance on the limits to the number of embryos to transfer: a committee opinion [^116dshWX]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Embryo transfer limits — other scenarios specify conditional increases or stricter limits. In each of the preceding age groups, patients who do not meet the criteria for a favorable prognosis may have an additional embryo transferred according to their individual circumstances, and the patient must be counseled regarding the additional risk of twin or higher-order multiple pregnancy. If otherwise favorable patients fail to conceive after multiple cycles with high-quality embryo(s) transferred, the physicians and patients may consider proceeding with an additional embryo to be transferred. Patients with a coexisting medical condition for which a multiple pregnancy may increase the risk of significant morbidity should not have more than one embryo transferred. In the rare cases in which recommended limits are exceeded, both the counseling and the justification must be documented in the patient's permanent medical record. In women ≥ 43 years of age, there are insufficient data to recommend a limit on the number of embryos to transfer when the patient uses her own oocytes, and caution should be exercised as the risk associated with multiple pregnancy increases dramatically with advancing maternal age.

### Optimal resources for children's surgical care: from the committee on children's surgery American college of surgeons [^115EHGAn]. APSA (2014). Medium credibility.

Children's surgical care — patient record and personal effects for transfer — specifies that each Institution agrees to provide information to accompany the patient from one Institution to the other, to include when available: patient identifiers and a decision‑maker contact ('Patient's name, address, patient identification number, age and the name, address and telephone number of at least one of the following (in the order of priority): the patient's legal guardian or other person authorized to make medical decisions for the patient;'), pertinent administrative and social information, third party billing data if any (including managed care participation and prior authorizations, provided in emergencies only if it does not delay treatment), and clinical documentation ('All medical records… including available history, records relating to the patient's emergency medical condition, observation of signs or symptoms, preliminary diagnosis').

### Systematic analysis of levels of evidence supporting American Academy of Ophthalmology preferred practice pattern guidelines, 2012–2021 [^112645SA]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

The Institute of Medicine's landmark reports on clinical practice guidelines were the impetus for the initial development of many guidelines in effect today. In 2011, the Institute of Medicine recommended standards for developing trustworthy clinical practice guidelines. The standards state that for each recommendation in a guideline, "a rating of the level of confidence in the evidence underpinning the recommendation" should be provided. Our results suggest that substantial underreporting of LOE may exist in current PPPs, as the number of recommendations with reported LOE fell from 1254 in prior PPPs to 94 in current PPPs. These results suggest that there is significant opportunity to include level II and III evidence, which, despite risk of bias, is nonetheless often critically important data.

Use of data sources such as insurance claims or multi-institutional registries can provide information about real-world clinical practice that cannot be generated by randomized clinical trials. Furthermore, there are clinical questions for which a randomized trial is infeasible, such as for rare conditions or for procedures where shams are not possible, and in these circumstances, lower levels of evidence ought to be weighted more heavily. Since many ophthalmologic diseases have a low incidence and a heavy reliance on surgical management in certain subspecialties, performing randomized controlled trials may be especially challenging. By acknowledging this and including varied levels of evidence in ophthalmology PPPs, authors may be able to more easily adopt the Institute of Medicine's recommendation about LOE reporting in clinical practice guidelines.

### The impact of prior authorization on clinical practice and patient care outcomes: a work group report of the AAAAI prior authorization task force [^1164wDhN]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). High credibility.

Prior authorization process in allergy-immunology — prior authorizations (PA) are now a routine method used by third-party payers to regulate patient care, with the Center of Medicare and Medicaid Services defining PA as "a decision by your health insurer or plan that a health care service, treatment plan, prescription drug or durable medical equipment is medically necessary". Also known as preauthorization, prior approval, or precertification, PA requires providers to establish and justify clinical eligibility before care can be delivered or continued; insurer-employed pharmacists and health care professionals review requests and reportedly judge appropriateness based on the latest clinical evidence while considering cost, safety, and alternatives, denying requests deemed too expensive when lower-cost alternatives exist or unnecessary. Requirements are not uniform, vary by payer, patient, patterns of use, and state regulations; submission methods differ (fax, paper, electronic) with often multiple payer contacts, and PAs are associated with significant indirect patient care administrative requirements for physicians and staff; advanced therapies for severe persistent asthma, including a combination inhaler with a long-acting β-agonist, inhaled corticosteroid, long-acting muscarinic agent, and/or biologic agent, may require PAs, and the PA process has evolved into a mechanism used by insurers to control costs by deterring or limiting prescribing of brand name or high‑cost medications.

### Current conditions in medical genetics practice [^1135K6N6]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Needed systems improvements

An adequate genetics workforce that includes more geneticists, utilizes other types of providers in genetics, and provides increased autonomy for genetic counselors is needed. Respondents also noted the need for improved insurance coverage of appropriate tests and less burdensome preauthorization, unified medical records that identify genetic risks, evidence-based quality metrics for genetic services, cooperation between university centers that treat rare diseases, and expanded use of telemedicine.

Genetic providers were asked to rank order what resources would help them serve their patients in the coming decade. Of 14 response categories, technical assistance resources (e.g. insurance preauthorization, and setting up telegenetics) were ranked highest. Education on genetics and genetic consultations for nongenetic health-care providers and the development of standardized approaches to genetic services based on best practice and evidence-based guidelines were highly ranked.

### Patient perspectives on prior authorization for cancer care [^115Sy1fr]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Health insurance companies may require prior authorization at any stage in the cancer care continuum, leading to the potential for denials and/or delays of diagnosis, treatment, or survivorship care. Patient experiences with prior authorization are largely unexplored, with most surveys focused on clinicians.

Objective

To characterize prior authorization for cancer care from the perspective of patients with cancer, using their own words.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This qualitative study provided a secondary thematic analysis of an online survey created in collaboration with patient advocates. Data were collected from July to October 2022. The survey was offered through a secure online platform. Participants included a convenience sample of patients with cancer, who self-reported being older than 18 years and having previous experience with prior authorization, recruited from social media, email lists, and word of mouth. Data were coded in May 2023, with initial themes constructed in September 2023.

Main Outcome and Measures

Responses to the open-ended prompt were coded inductively by trained members of the research team, and themes were developed by the study team through discussion.

Results

Of 178 respondents in the parent quantitative survey, 89 (50%) provided free-text responses. Most respondents to the open-ended question were women (79 [89%]) and aged 18 to 39 (35 [39%]) or 40 to 54 (31 [35%]). Codes from responses related to patient experiences, views of the process, and perception of the role of the health care team. Four interconnected themes were created from the codes: blinded navigation, intersecting burdens, interference with care, and a broken system.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this qualitative secondary analysis of patient experiences with prior authorization, themes centered on how, from the patient perspective, prior authorization was a confusing process that added to the administrative, psychosocial, and financial burdens of cancer care. Intersecting burdens amplified the negative impact of prior authorization on patients. Patients voiced concerns that highlighted the broken, profit-driven nature of the United States health care system. Advocacy efforts are needed to promote reform to ensure patients receive timely access to recommended care, and policy considerations toward this reform must center the patient experience.

### Burden with No benefit: prior authorization in congenital cardiology [^114D6JDF]. Pediatric Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prior authorization is a process that health insurance companies use to determine if a patient's health insurance policy will cover certain medical treatments, procedures, or medications. The process typically involves the healthcare provider submitting a request to the insurance company, which then evaluates the request based on specific criteria, such as medical necessity and coverage policies. Prior authorization is a payer-initiated process to assess whether a proposed service or treatment is medically indicated. In the 1960s, as an early model of prior authorization, Medicare and Medicaid created a health insurance costs and utilization review system with the goal of reducing overutilization and waste. However, prior authorization's use in the modern era has resulted in substantial administrative burden, unnecessary delays in patient care, and care-delivery inequities. The medical community has repeatedly expressed that these hardships outweigh the financial gains for payors, and that the added administrative work drives increased overhead and physician burnout.

In 2016, the American Medical Association surveyed physicians (40% primary care and 60% specialist) about their perspectives on prior authorizations. About 75% of physicians described the burden of prior authorization on physicians and staff as high or extremely high. Almost 25% of practices reported spending over 20 hours per week processing prior authorizations. 90% of providers reported a care delay associated with prior authorization even though 79% of claims were ultimately approved. Moreover, 34% of offices had staff members whose sole responsibility was to process prior authorizations. In 2017, The American College of Cardiology published a survey of its membership that demonstrated not only administrative costs and delays in care, but also major safety concerns associated with the prior authorization process. 77% of cardiologists felt there was less time spent on patient care by the practice, clinician, or staff because of the time required for medical documentation and the prior authorization process. 62% felt that this resulted in significant patient confusion and treatment interruption. Additionally, 78% of denials conflicted with the American College of Cardiology's (ACC) published Appropriate Use Criteria. The lack of agreement between insurers and providers erodes the patient's and family's trust in the healthcare system.

### Measuring the scope of prior authorization policies: applying private insurer rules to Medicare part B [^115FGEie]. JAMA Health Forum (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Health insurers use prior authorization to evaluate the medical necessity of planned medical services. Data challenges have precluded measuring the frequency with which medical services can require prior authorization, the spending on these services, the types of services and clinician specialties affected, and differences in the scope of prior authorization policies between government-administered and privately administered insurance.

Objectives

To measure the extent of prior authorization requirements for medical services and to describe the services and clinician specialties affected by them using novel data on private insurer coverage policies.

Design Setting and Participants

Fee-for-service Medicare claims from 2017 were analyzed for beneficiaries in Medicare Part B, which lacks prior authorization. We measured the use of services that would have been subject to prior authorization according to the coverage rules of a large Medicare Advantage insurer and calculated the associated spending. We report the rates of these services for 14 clinical categories and 27 clinician specialties.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Annual count per beneficiary and associated spending for 1151 services requiring prior authorization by the Medicare Advantage insurer; likelihood of providing 1 or more such service per year, by clinician specialty.

Results

Of 6497534 beneficiaries (mean [SD] age, 72.1 [12.1] years), 41% received at least 1 service per year that would have been subject to prior authorization under Medicare Advantage prior authorization requirements. The mean (SD) number of services per beneficiary per year was 2.2 (8.9) (95% CI, 2.17–2.18), corresponding to a mean (SD) of $1661 ($8900) in spending per beneficiary per year (95% CI, $1654-$1668), or 25% of total annual Part B spending. Part B drugs constituted 58% of the associated spending, mostly accounted for by hematology or oncology drugs. Radiology was the largest source of nondrug spending (16%), followed by musculoskeletal services (9%). Physician specialties varied widely in rates of services that required prior authorization, with highest rates among radiation oncologists (97%), cardiologists (93%), and radiologists (91%) and lowest rates among pathologists (2%) and psychiatrists (4%).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study, a large portion of fee-for-service Medicare Part B spending would have been subject to prior authorization under private insurance coverage policies. Prior authorization requirements for Part B drugs have been an important source of difference in coverage policy between government-administered and privately administered Medicare.

### Oncology trainee perceptions of the prior authorization process: a national survey [^1177GzFJ]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The medical trainee perspective regarding the prior authorization process has not been previously assessed. Here we evaluate the perceptions of radiation and medical oncology trainees regarding the prior authorization process and its effect on their training and patient care.

Methods and Materials

A 12-question, nonincentivized, electronic national survey of radiation and medical oncology trainees at all Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education accredited oncology programs was conducted. Participation, perspectives, and experiences with the prior authorization process were assessed by Likert scale, free response, and multiple response selection.

Results

Between January and March of 2019, the survey was distributed to 1505 trainees at 76 institutions with responses from 174/616 radiation (28.2%) and 139/889 medical oncology trainees (15.6%). The majority (69.2%) reported participating in the prior authorization process (radiation: 78.2% vs medical: 57.6%; P < .01). Most trainees (71%) reported concern for decline in the quality of patient care due to the prior authorization process. The majority of trainees (77.1%) reported decreased enthusiasm for work and choice of profession, with a higher incidence in medical oncology trainees (83.1% vs 73.7%, P = 0.04). The most commonly recommended modifications by trainees included that the insurance reviewer be in the same specialty as the ordering provider (87.7%), providers be compensated for participation (82.7%), and turnaround time be more rapid (74.3%).

Conclusions

These data indicate that trainees in US oncology programs are active participants in the prior authorization process and report that prior authorization approvals negatively influence their medical training and the quality of patient care. Additional efforts to revise the insurance approval process are warranted.

### The burden of insurance prior authorization on cancer care: a review of evidence from radiation oncology [^111oY2Nk]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Despite its high cost-effectiveness, radiation oncology faces the greatest prior authorization (PA) burden of any medical specialty. Insurance denials and resulting treatment delays have been documented across several treatment modalities, including stereotactic body radiation, intensity modulated radiation, and proton therapy. Although insurance companies suggest that PA is intended to control health care spending and ensure the implementation of evidence-based practice, the number of radiation treatment plans reviewed by the PA process that result in changes is quite low. Yet, the cost to patients, providers, and the health care system is rising. The increased administrative work required to address the appeal process, including the development of radiation plan comparisons, results in lost productivity of radiation staff and increased clinic costs that are not currently reimbursed. Treatment delays from PA may elevate patient anxiety and affect their ability to enroll in clinical trials, resulting in decreased quality of care. As a result of possible harm to patients, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services developed a ruling that mandates increased transparency of insurers' requirements, decreased allowable time for arriving at PA decisions, and a more efficient electronic communication system to address the time and resource burden of PA.

Methods and Materials

This article summarizes key discussions from the literature and provides recommendations to help mitigate insurance PA strain.

Results

These recommendations broadly address the following key areas: (1) omission of PA for routine care and clinical trials, (2) implementation of efficient, streamlined electronic peer-to-peer communication, (3) increased transparency of insurance requirements and rationale for denials, and (4) decreased time allowances for PA decisions.

Conclusions

Policy reform focused on evidence-driven treatment coverage, reduction of the proportion of cases requiring PA, and a simplified, timely insurance appeal process is necessary to ensure optimal cancer care for patients requiring radiation therapy as part of their cancer journey.

### Optimal resources for children's surgical care: from the committee on children's surgery American college of surgeons [^112sM3qU]. APSA (2014). Medium credibility.

Patient transfer — referring Institution responsibilities and pre-transfer care are specified as follows: the referring Institution fulfills its responsibility by notifying the receiving Institution promptly and providing all information appropriate under the circumstances whenever it wants to transfer a patient; obtaining any necessary medical authorization by a physician or other qualified medical person and any necessary consent by or on behalf of the patient for the transfer; documenting the medical justification for the transfer in the patient's medical records; making all transportation arrangements required to accomplish the transfer; and delivering the patient to the receiving Institution or the receiving Institution's Transport Department, with his or her billing information, valuables, medical records and other information sufficient to allow knowledgeable treatment of the patient at the receiving Institution. To the extent possible, stabilization and treatment will be initiated prior to transfer to ensure that the transfer will not, within reasonable medical probability, result in harm or jeopardize survival of the patient or transporting team.

### Magnetic resonance imaging prior authorizations for orthopaedic care are negatively affected by medicaid insurance status [^111bmMcb]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). Medium credibility.

Overall, our results showed markedly decreased odds of authorization for MRIs of the spine and when the chief symptom for the MRI was associated with spine pathology. The use and denial of MRI in spine pathology has been extensively studied in the literature because MRI remains the benchmark diagnostic modality in spine. Kebaish et alrecently questioned the overall utility of spine MRI preauthorizations and found that despite high levels of preauthorization requirements, 96.57% of MRIs ordered were actually completed. The authors then questioned the utility of such requirements given the potential to delay necessary patient care. Similarly, Bukowiec et al emphasized the burden that patients and physicians face to obtain prior authorization for a lumbar spine MRI and further highlighted the lack of transparency in Evicore's guidelines, which are adhered to by most insurance companies. The authors attempted to objectively evaluate the guidelines using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II tool with only one domain, clarity of guideline, meeting threshold for adequate rigor and transparency with the remaining domains falling below threshold. Taking the analysis a step further, Imam et alstudied the percentage of MRI prior authorization denials that were approved following peer-to-peer discussions in a single outpatient orthopaedic clinic. They found that 95.1% of MRI studies were eventually approved following peer-to-peer discussions. Therefore, the delay in patient care that results from the denial of an MRI prior-authorization request despite a high eventual approval rate following an appeal highlights the need for crucial reform in this burdensome process.

Socioeconomic factors and insurance coverage are well-studied potential obstacles to timely patient care, and it is that disparities exist in orthopaedic care. For example, public insurance was independently associated with suboptimal outcomes in a study examining the effect of social determinants on total shoulder arthroplasty. In addition, patients who identify as African American are of lower SES or live in lower income neighborhoods have been reported to have worse outcomes following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, total hip arthroplasty, total knee arthroplasty, and anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty. Current literature has also reported that public insurance results in greater delay to MRI than private insurance in the pediatric population. Similarly, a recent narrative review found that patients with public insurance or no insurance experienced greater delays to diagnosis and treatment of anterior cruciate ligament injuries compared with those with private insurance. Although we did not find race or SES to be statistically significant between authorized and denied MRI requests, the primary insurance payor was notable in our study.

### How to use the American Geriatrics Society 2015 beers criteria – A guide for patients, clinicians, health systems, and payors [^1165xmyh]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2015). Medium credibility.

American Geriatrics Society (AGS) 2015 Beers Criteria — prior authorization and insurance coverage — indicate there is a reasonable role for health plan design to screen for these medications for extra attention and review, and some medications are particularly harmful or have few reasonable indications, justifying tight controls. However, many medications in the criteria can have appropriate uses, and excessive restrictions may harm people by limiting their access, cause undue burden on prescribers, and frame the Beers Criteria in a punitive light. In most cases requiring authorization, clinicians should have access to a streamlined process to justify use that should ideally be available across a range of prior authorization issues, and when such medications are flagged for approval or review, appropriate alternative therapies should be suggested where possible.

### Fertility preservation in people with cancer: ASCO guideline update [^113jkxuM]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

ASCO fertility preservation guideline — role of clinicians recommendations specify that all clinicians should be prepared to discuss infertility as a potential risk of therapy and that this discussion should take place as soon as possible once a cancer diagnosis is made and can occur simultaneously with staging and the formulation of a treatment plan; there are benefits for patients in discussing fertility information with clinicians at every step of the cancer journey; clinicians should encourage participation in registries and clinical studies to define gonadotoxic risks and the safety and efficacy of fertility preservation (FP) strategies (Good Practice Statement); clinicians should refer patients who express an interest in fertility, as well as those who are ambivalent or uncertain, to reproductive specialists as soon as possible (Good Practice Statement); oncology teams should identify and ensure prompt access to a multidisciplinary FP team and maintain effective, timely, and regular communication to provide coordinated, comprehensive care (Good Practice Statement); and insurance benefit mandates should specify comprehensive coverage of guideline-based FP services and storage with elimination of prior authorization, and clinicians should advocate for coverage and clinic-based resources to help patients access benefits (Good Practice Statement).

### Institutional readiness for novel therapeutics: a framework for multidisciplinary integration [^1136N98w]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The landscape of therapeutic options for rare diseases is rapidly expanding, including a range of novel treatments such as antisense oligonucleotides, enzyme replacement therapies, targeted small molecules, mRNA, and gene replacement therapies. The integration of these high-cost, advanced therapeutics into clinical practice presents significant challenges. This focused review aims to outline the practical aspects of implementing non-gene therapy therapeutics that have been recently approved for rare diseases in a clinical setting, focusing on the multidisciplinary efforts required for successful integration, the coordination with various healthcare specialists, and the management of institutional and insurance-related barriers. Effective implementation necessitates strong institutional support and comprehensive infrastructure, including specialized clinics and dedicated pharmacy services. Key strategies involve developing new treatment protocols, ensuring robust payor support, and coordinating with pharmaceutical companies. The successful deployment of these new to market therapeutics hinges on a well-coordinated, institution-wide approach that addresses both clinical and logistical challenges. Emphasizing multi-disciplinary collaboration and patient-centric care, institutions can navigate the complexities of recently approved rare disease treatments, improving outcomes and access for this vulnerable patient population.

### Can you hear us now? The impact of health-care utilization by rare disease patients in the United States [^11516ntn]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

To better understand the economic impact and health-care utilization of RD, a comprehensive analysis of inpatient, readmission, and emergency visits in 2016 was conducted. A RD in a patient's record was the single biggest predictor of health-care services, and included duration, type, and cost of that utilization when comparing to CCs. These factors were analyzed in detail to provide a comprehensive assessment of the impact of RD in health care. The individual conditions included in the study, as well as average age, LOS, and total charges are included in Table S3.

### White paper: American Gastroenterological Association position statement: the future of IBD care in the United States-Removing barriers and embracing opportunities [^1123CrQg]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease prior authorization (PA) and step therapy — treatment delays and policy stance: A study reported that a simple PA results in a 10.2-day (95% CI, 9.2–12.3 d) delay in starting a biologic and a complicated PA results in a 24.6-day (95% CI, 16.4–32.8 d) delay in starting a biologic. Similarly, step therapy results in treatment delays, and the AGA guidelines for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease recommend against the use of step-therapy policies by insurance companies.

### Advocating for patients with inflammatory bowel disease: how to navigate the prior authorization process [^111Fb1mC]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

In an effort to manage health care costs and avoid improper medication use, prior authorizations (PAs) have become a standard stipulation required by payers in the determination of medication coverage. For gastroenterologists managing patients, especially those with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the PA process is time-consuming and further complicated by 2 additional factors: step therapy requirements and failure of payers to recognize updated IBD treatment pathways. These factors often lead to PA denials and cause treatment delays, which in turn can lead to disease progression, ongoing patient suffering, and ultimately an increase in both direct and indirect total costs. In this manuscript, the PA process, PA models, tips and available resources to navigate the PA process, and future advocacy efforts are discussed with the intent to help gastroenterology practices optimize PA outcomes and improve the care provided to patients with IBD and other gastrointestinal disorders.

### Immunizing patients with adverse events after immunization and potential contraindications to immunization: a report from the special immunization clinics network [^1153GatD]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

For patients who have experienced adverse events following immunization (AEFI) or who have specific medical conditions, there is limited evidence regarding the best approach to immunization. The Special Immunization Clinics (SICs) Network was established to standardize patient management and assess outcomes after reimmunization. The study objective was to describe the first 2 years of the network's implementation.

Methods

Twelve SICs were established across Canada by infectious diseases specialists and allergists. Inclusion criteria were as follows: local reaction ≥ 10cm, allergic symptoms < 24 hours postimmunization, neurologic symptoms and other AEFI or medical conditions of concern. Eligible patients underwent a standardized evaluation, causality assessment was performed, immunization recommendations were made by expert physicians and patients were followed up to capture AEFI. After individual consent, data were transferred to a central database for analysis.

Results

From June 2013 to May 2015, 151 patients were enrolled. Most were referred for prior AEFI (132/151, 87%): 42 (32%) for allergic-like reactions, 31 (23%) for injection-site reactions, 20 (15%) for neurologic symptoms and 39 (30%) for other systemic symptoms. Nineteen patients (13%) were seen for underlying conditions that complicated immunization. Reimmunization was recommended for 109 patients, 60 of whom (55%) were immunized and followed up. Eleven patients (18%) experienced recurrence of their AEFI; none were serious (eg, resulting in hospitalization, permanent disability or death).

Conclusions

The most frequent reasons for referral to a SIC were allergic-like events and injection site reactions. Reimmunization was safe in most patients. Larger studies are needed to determine outcomes for specific types of AEFI.

### Current transition practice for primary immunodeficiencies and autoinflammatory diseases in Europe: a RITA-ERN survey [^115ZdFcG]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Meeting the adult team prior to transfer has been identified as a significant factor in predicting better outcomes for young people living with long-term conditions. This occurred in the majority of, but not all, centers transitioning young adults with PID or AID through the provision of joint in-person or virtual clinics attended by HCPs from both pediatric and adult centers prior to the transfer of care. Although special care services for young people are recommended by the International Patient Organisation for Primary immunodeficiencies (IPOPI), only a small proportion of PID and AID clinics surveyed reported transferring their patients to adult services with designated young adult clinics, with even fewer transferring their patient cohort to adolescent immunology clinics prior to adult services. These practices may reduce the confidence of young adults to manage their health, as only 60% or less of all the services in this sample discuss broader psychosocial and occupational concerns like fertility, sexual health, substance use, mental health and wellbeing, vocational and life expectations, and health insurance with their patients prior to transfer (see Supplementary Table 3). Transition to adolescent centers or dedicated young adult clinics may thus allow for the provision of holistic care to young patients by addressing health and wellbeing concerns specific to this developmental stage alongside those stemming from their IEI.

### White paper: American Gastroenterological Association position statement: the future of IBD care in the United States-Removing barriers and embracing opportunities [^115qSbMX]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Prior authorization (PA) and step therapy — burden and impact metrics are reported as follows: PA is defined as a process requiring approval from insurance companies or pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) before tests or medications, and in a physician survey by the American Medical Association practices averaged 45 PAs per physician per week and spent 14 hours every week completing PAs; in the AGA public policy survey 2023, 93% of gastroenterologists reported that PAs were somewhat or significantly burdensome to their practice; additionally, 94% of physicians reported that PAs resulted in delay in access to necessary care, with 33% of physicians noting that the PAs led to a serious adverse event for a patient in their care; despite this, a survey by the Medical Group Management Association reported that 98% of practices noted that payers had the same PA requirements or increased PA requirements over the past year; and step therapy or fail-first policies are described as strategies requiring use of a designated preferred drug before allowing the use of other medications.

### Delays related to prior authorization in inflammatory bowel disease [^116CG9TD]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Delays in advancing to biologic therapies are associated with adverse outcomes in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Insurer-mandated prior authorizations have been linked to prolonged medication initiation times. We hypothesized that prior authorizations are associated with prolonged biologic initiation time and increased IBD-related healthcare utilization among children with IBD.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of 190 pediatric patients with IBD initiating biologics at a tertiary care hospital to measure the association between prior authorization, biologic initiation time (physician recommendation to first dose), and healthcare utilization (hospitalization, surgery, or emergency department visit). Demographic, insurance, and disease severity-related covariables were collected. Multivariable linear regression was used to measure the association between prior authorization and biologic initiation time. Propensity score methods were used to measure the associations between prior authorization and IBD-related healthcare utilization within 180 days and corticosteroid dependence at 90 days, with adjustment for insurance type, demographics, and disease severity-related characteristics.

Results

Median biologic initiation time was 21 days. Prior authorization and complicated prior authorizations (requiring appeal, step therapy, or peer-to-peer review) were associated with 10.2-day (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.2 to 12.3) and 24.6-day (95% CI 16.4 to 32.8) increases in biologic initiation time, respectively. Prior authorizations increased the likelihood of IBD-related healthcare utilization within 180 days by 12.9% (95% CI 2.5 to 23.4) and corticosteroid dependence at 90 days by 14.1% (95% CI 3.3 to 24.8).

Conclusions

Prior authorizations are associated with prolonged biologic initiation time and increased IBD-related healthcare utilization. Minimizing prior authorization-related delays may expedite biologic delivery and reduce the risk of IBD-related healthcare utilization.

### Regional disparities in qualified health plans' prior authorization requirements for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis in the United States [^117Eykpd]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Prior authorizations are often used when there is more than 1 interchangeable therapy available within a drug class and the cost differs. Until recently, there was only 1 medication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for PrEP, meaning that prior authorization was used for other reasons, for instance, to determine HIV risk or clinical eligibility for PrEP. There have been instances of insurance companies denying PrEP prior authorization requests for discriminatory reasons. In addition, the prior authorization process has been found to be frustrating to patients and clinicians because of the complexity, the consequences of delayed or denied medications, and poor communication between stakeholders.

In a recent survey, 92% of physicians reported that prior authorizations lead to delays in medically necessary therapy, and 78% of physicians reported that a prior authorization at least sometimes leads to patients' abandoning a recommended medication. It is unknown if or how often the inconvenience of a prior authorization changes a clinician's decision about whether to prescribe PrEP. The clinician and patient frequently do not know about the prior authorization requirement until the patient goes to pick up the medication and is told about the restriction. It is unknown if or how prior authorizations affect PrEP prescription filling rates and delays in obtaining PrEP. One research group in the South has demonstrated a delay in PrEP initiation for people who relied on drug manufacturer assistance programs, which require application paperwork similar to insurance companies' prior authorizations. Although some states have laws stating that an insurance company must respond to a medication prior authorization request within 2 days, some states give insurers up to 10 days, and many states have no regulation on response time. If this period only includes business days, it could result in additional delays because of weekends and holidays. Some states have shorter time frames for medications that are deemed urgent, but PrEP is not categorized as an urgent medication. It may be beneficial for PrEP to be in the urgent medication category because any delay in PrEP initiation for a population at increased risk of HIV can result in new HIV transmissions.

### Obesity and advocacy: a joint clinical perspective and expert review from the Obesity Medicine Association and the obesity action coalition – 2024 [^114bh3dC]. Obesity Pillars (2024). High credibility.

Individual advocacy for patients with obesity — Individual advocacy is when an individual or group furthers the interests of one or more people, exemplified by clinicians investing personal or staff time to petition insurance companies to provide coverage for medications, services, diagnostic tests, and referral to specialists; practical ways include use of people first language, avoidance of staff jokes and phrases offensive to patients with obesity, and availability of obesity-appropriate office environment and equipment. Clinician support of individual advocacy may include writing letters or holding meetings with human resource departments of patient employers to advocate for comprehensive coverage of obesity treatment options, investing in a robust prior authorization and appeal process within the medical practice, and implementing a prior authorization function in the practice that usually requires a thorough understanding and navigation of insurance requirements to effectively advocate for patient needs; clinicians can leverage their expertise in obesity management by explaining the scientific basis and medical rationale for treating the disease of obesity during meetings with officials, clinicians can initiate or join public awareness campaigns, and clinicians also have the option to engage in direct communication with legislators through letters, emails, or meetings to reinforce the importance of comprehensive obesity care; optimal mitigation of weight stigma might best be achieved by integrating differing levels of advocacy, including self-advocacy, individual advocacy, and system advocacy.

### Assessment of US hospital compliance with regulations for patients' requests for medical records [^114ELmeT]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Requesting medical records remains a complicated and burdensome process for patients despite policy efforts and regulation to make medical records more readily available to patients. Our results revealed inconsistencies in information provided by medical records authorization forms and by medical records departments in select US hospitals, as well as potentially unaffordable costs and processing times that were not compliant with federal regulations. As legislation, including the recent 21st Century Cures Act, and government-wide initiatives like MyHealthEData continue to stipulate improvements in patient access to medical records, attention to the most obvious barriers should be paramount.

### Insurance appeals for pediatric reconstructive surgery: a micro cost analysis and how-to guide [^112KCj27]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

When insurance coverage for pediatric reconstructive procedures is denied, a stressful and time-consuming appeals process ensues. This article discusses the results of a micro cost analysis performed to better understand the time and monetary burden that the insurance process places on our clinic and families. We also advise plastic surgeons on how to appeal insurance denials for necessary reconstructive procedures.

Methods

Our micro cost analysis focused on patients with congenital breast anomalies who were denied insurance coverage during the preservice insurance authorization process. We surveyed staff and family members to determine the steps involved in the insurance process and how long each person spent on each step. We combined this with average compensation data to calculate cost.

Results

For the 5 patients included in our analysis, the insurance process took an average of 7.4 hours of institutional time and cost $521.43 per patient. All patients were denied coverage during prior authorization and required a peer-to-peer, and all denials occurred because surgery was deemed cosmetic or not medically necessary.

Conclusions

This analysis estimated the time and monetary cost of the insurance process in our department. Access to care was limited by prior authorization and the opinion of medical directors that these procedures are unnecessary or cosmetic. We encourage plastic surgeons to continue to perform patient-centered outcomes research in their practice to build on literature that proves the functional and psychosocial benefits of reconstructive procedures.

### Burden with No benefit: prior authorization in congenital cardiology [^112MGRC7]. Pediatric Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Proposed Solutions

We advocate for the discontinuation of prior authorizations for routine diagnostics, all congenital heart disease related interventional and surgical procedures, and routine cardiac disease specific medications for the ACPC patient population. Requiring prior authorizations for a small, complex subspecialty such as ACPC confers harm in the form of administrative burden, care delays, and worsening social inequity without evidence of significant financial benefits (Fig. 1). Anecdotal reports, studies from other pediatric subspecialities, and our single center analysis shows the denial rate is close to zero. Steps have already been taken at the legislative level to eliminate the prior authorization process in certain settings. In Texas, House Bill 3459 passed in 2022 so that providers with a 90% or higher prior authorization approval rating will be exempt from future prior authorization burden for that service in the future. In Maryland, Senate Bill 688 was introduced to require insurers adhere to the 48 hour turnaround time for prior authorization claims and eliminated prior authorizations for generic medications. These bills are important steps toward appropriate change in payor-reform, but larger and broader changes must be implemented such as requiring public reporting of denial rates and care delays related to prior authorizations or, better yet, eliminating the prior authorization process altogether. Once prior authorization is eliminated, providers can use guidelines published in peer-reviewed journals to guide appropriate use as we continue to research the optimal diagnostic and treatment strategies for this complex patient population.

### Preoperative optimization strategy management model applied in gallbladder surgery [^114jx5yd]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Determination of pre-hospitalization management content and implementation process

Determining Admission Scope: For patients in the hepatobiliary surgery ward who require hospitalization due to stable conditions but cannot be admitted immediately due to a lack of available beds, formal pre-admission examinations are conducted through reserved pre-admission beds. Patients who do not stay in the hospital will undergo necessary examinations and preoperative preparations as provided by the hospital.

Pre-Admission Management Requirements: (1) Pre-admission patients should be admitted within three days; if they fail to do so, the information system will issue a prompt. The Admission and Discharge Management Center will provide an explanation and make recommendations for extending the pre-admission time limit or transferring to self-payment discharge, which must be approved by the medical insurance office before implementation. (2) Following the formal admission of pre-admission patients, the clinical department should schedule surgery within two working days. If there are valid reasons for a delay, the attending physician must document these reasons in the medical records. (3) Clinical doctors should inform patients of relevant matters regarding pre-admission after issuing the pre-admission card and provide two copies of the "Informed Consent for Pre-Admission", signed by the physician, along with the relevant examination forms. (4) During the pre-admission process, staff at the Admission and Discharge Management Center should reiterate the specific procedures and precautions to the patients and collect a signed copy of the "Informed Consent for Pre-Admission" for retention. (5) When scheduling examinations, efforts should be made to arrange for them to be conducted on the same day whenever possible. (6) Medical insurance patients should use their social security card for unified billing during the pre-admission period and make advance payments according to their condition, all handled at the inpatient department. (7) If a medical insurance patient is not formally admitted due to personal reasons during the pre-admission period, all expenses incurred during this period will be settled as self-payment, and a self-payment invoice will be issued. In special cases, the Information Department should assist outpatient physicians in completing inpatient refunds and outpatient billing. (8) Upon the formal admission of pre-admission patients, the ward medical staff should transfer their pre-admission beds to regular beds. (9) The patient's hospitalization period should commence from the time of formal admission, and hospitalization invoices, medical records, etc. should reflect this time of formal admission. (10) Managing physicians should document the results of examinations conducted during the patient's pre-admission period in the medical records, and various examination reports should be directly included in the inpatient records. (11) If a pre-admission patient exhibits critical values during examinations, these should be treated as outpatient critical values; if specialist inpatient treatment is required, the patient should be promptly transferred to regular hospitalization. (12) Providing timely general anesthesia in the anesthesia clinic to conduct comprehensive anesthesia evaluations, if necessary, facilitating multidisciplinary collaborative diagnosis and treatment, and assessing vital physiological organs to predict risk factors and evaluate the patient's ability to tolerate surgery.(13)The Medical Affairs Department, Medical Insurance Office, and other related departments should regularly inspect pre-admission situations and address any violations in accordance with hospital regulations. (14) Follow-up evaluations of pre-admission patients after discharge, along with continuous quality improvement, should be conducted.

### Clinical trials… [^113Fg1cb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Below are selected guidances that are relevant to rare disease drug development, organized by topic. This list does not include all FDA guidances on or relevant to rare disease drug development but represents our most commonly used guidances. This list may be updated periodically. You can search all FDA Guidances by topic, FDA Center, or issue date here. FDA is publishing this draft guidance to help inform the design and implementation of natural history studies that can be used to support the development of safe and effective drugs and biological products for rare diseases. A natural history study collects information about the natural history of a disease in the absence of an intervention, from the disease's onset until either its resolution or the individual's death.

Although knowledge of a disease's natural history can benefit drug development for many disorders and conditions, natural history information is usually not available or is incomplete for most rare diseases; therefore, natural history information is particularly needed for these diseases. This guidance also describes the procedures for expedited withdrawal of approval of a product approved under accelerated approval and the revisions Congress made through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023. Additional programs to expedite product development and review are covered in other guidances. Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions
- Drugs and Biologics The following four FDA programs are intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition: fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval, and priority review designation.

The purpose of this guidance is to provide recommendations regarding the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information that should be provided in an investigational new drug application submitted by a sponsor-investigator developing an individualized antisense oligonucleotide drug product for a severely debilitating or life-threatening disease caused by a unique genetic variant where only a small number of individuals are prospectively identified. Investigational New Drug Applications Investigational New Drug Applications Prepared and Submitted by Sponsor-Investigators. Voucher Program Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Vouchers This guidance provides information on the implementation of section 908 of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, which added section 529 to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

Under section 529, FDA will award priority review vouchers to sponsors of certain rare pediatric disease product applications that meet the criteria specified in that section.

### The personal physician's role in helping patients with medical conditions stay at work or return to work [^114EN4Xn]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Documentation, delays, and consultation — identifying and minimizing unnecessary delays in provision of health care services is emphasized; if there is a delay in approval for recommended treatment, physician involvement can expedite matters by explaining benefits so adjusters and/or employers realize this will move the case forward. Objective, accurate, and complete medical documentation to facilitate transitions in patient care, return to work, approval of medical treatment, proper setting of insurance reserves, and payment of bills is described, and it is part of the physician's role to complete and return required forms relating to return to work in a timely fashion. In complex cases with factors such as ongoing hazards or potential public risk, the treating physician may consult appropriate specialists; primary care physicians may benefit from the expertise of occupational medicine specialists, and useful information and expertise is also available from employers, insurance companies, or appropriate governmental agencies.

### Whole exome sequencing in pediatric neurology patients: clinical implications and estimated cost analysis [^112UzTUS]. Journal of Child Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Genetic heterogeneity in neurologic disorders has been an obstacle to phenotype-based diagnostic testing. The authors hypothesized that information compiled via whole exome sequencing will improve clinical diagnosis and management of pediatric neurology patients. The authors performed a retrospective chart review of patients evaluated in the University of Michigan Pediatric Neurology clinic between 6/2011 and 6/2015. The authors recorded previous diagnostic testing, indications for whole exome sequencing, and whole exome sequencing results. Whole exome sequencing was recommended for 135 patients and obtained in 53 patients. Insurance barriers often precluded whole exome sequencing. The most common indication for whole exome sequencing was neurodevelopmental disorders. Whole exome sequencing improved the presumptive diagnostic rate in the patient cohort from 25% to 48%. Clinical implications included family planning, medication selection, and systemic investigation. Compared to current second tier testing, whole exome sequencing can result in lower long-term charges and more timely diagnosis. Overcoming barriers related to whole exome sequencing insurance authorization could allow for more efficient and fruitful diagnostic neurological evaluations.

### Delivering cellular and gene therapies to patients: solutions for realizing the potential of the next generation of medicine [^113gh8AL]. Gene Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Step 3: Patient Protection and Support

The types of patients who may benefit from cell and gene therapies are diverse: a cancer patient with advanced disease, a child with a rare genetic condition whose parents must coordinate care across multiple states, or someone born with blindness that may see for the first time. Patients will go through a difficult and extremely expensive process, likely more so than for traditional therapeutics. To ensure access, payers, hospitals, manufacturers, and the government need to provide financial support and evolve the approaches to patient information.

Patients and families will likely incur significant out-of-pocket costs to go to a certified center, stay nearby, and manage a complicated life for a period of months or years. While nonprofit organizations such as Ronald McDonald House Charities provide assistance, ensuring payers provide reasonable reimbursement for all associated costs is critical. Patient support programs from manufacturers also help, and adjusting rules so services can be provided when physicians make treatment decisions (so long as they are not an inducement to prescribe) would make this process more efficient and effective.

Patient data will travel across multiple institutions and disciplines, raising the importance of a seamless transfer of information and protection of confidentiality. A center will order the therapy with protected patient information directly from the pharmaceutical company or third-party distributor. Pharmaceutical companies may need to become HIPAA-covered entities or business associates, and tailored technical solutions will need to be developed and rules adopted to cover access to information, even with broad patient consent.

### The team-based approach to undiagnosed and rare diseases [^116Px8nD]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Patients with undiagnosed or rare diseases often remain without a diagnosis for many years. Many are misdiagnosed or treated symptomatically without having an identified underlying disease process. Health care providers in general practice and subspecialists are equipped to diagnose diseases commonly seen. Most practitioners are unlikely to be familiar with uncommon manifestations of a common disorder and have little or no experience with rare diseases. Multidisciplinary teams are effective in reviewing patients with undiagnosed and rare diseases and in developing a new diagnostic strategy for appropriate evaluation. A medical librarian and an access coordinating navigator are essential members of the team.

### Effect of the addition of a mental health specialist for evaluation of undiagnosed patients in centres for rare diseases (ZSE-DUO): a prospective, controlled trial with a two-phase cohort design [^116e7ozT]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

ZSE-DUO is a prospective, controlled trial with a two-phase cohort design conducted in 11 CRDs in Germany (identifier:). A detailed description of the methodology is available in the online Supplementary Material and the published study protocol. The original study protocol is available at.

Ethics committee approval

All ethics committees of the participating CRDs located at the university hospitals in Aachen, Bochum, Frankfurt, Hannover, Magdeburg/Halle, Mainz, Münster, Regensburg, Tübingen, Ulm and Würzburg, and of the institutions involved in data analysis (University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hannover Medical School, and University of Würzburg) approved the project. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants and guardians, where applicable; all minors gave assent.

Patient and public involvement

The German umbrella patient organisation Alliance for Chronic Rare Diseases (ACHSE) e.V. representing more than 120 individual patient organisations, was deeply involved in the planning and conduct of the trial, and is represented by Christine Mundlos among the authors. Inclusion of the innovative care into regular care will be promoted in Germany with the support of ACHSE e.V.

Participants

Individuals aged 12 years or older who were referred by their treating physician for further diagnostic evaluation of a suspected RD to one of the participating CRDs were invited to participate in the trial. Referring physicians were required to provide a medical summary, including reasons for suspecting a RD. Additional inclusion criteria were: 1) first contact with any of the participating CRDs, 2) attending the CRD's outpatient clinic for undiagnosed cases, and 3) providing written informed consent for study participation. Referrals were excluded from participation if medical records available to the CRD were incomplete or one or more disease(s) had previously been diagnosed, explaining the entire symptomatic spectrum presented. Furthermore, only patients insured by statutory health insurances covering about 90% of the German population were included.

### The international rare diseases research consortium: policies and guidelines to maximize impact [^112W8PUB]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

Natural history

Performing natural history studies will facilitate the identification of disease characteristics that can be used when planning and conducting clinical investigations for rare disease therapies. Moreover, this knowledge will also serve to define a trial's target population, develop biomarkers for disease progression and therapeutic response, determine appropriate surrogate and relevant clinical endpoints, and decide on the study duration. As rare diseases are highly diverse in nature, there is no one set of data elements that can be recommended for data collection in all natural history rare disease studies; rather the disease characteristics should reflect the prominent features of the rare disease.

Therapeutics

Clinical trials represent a major challenge for the development of therapies intended to treat, cure, or prevent rare diseases. It is well recognized that clinical investigation in this field is associated with several hurdles that may jeopardize the performance of these investigations, when compared with common diseases. Small patient populations, together with geographical dispersion, add complexity to the design and performance of trials aimed at providing efficacy and safety information supporting a marketing authorization/approval of these therapies. However, introduction of rare diseases legislation and orphan designation procedures have brought a large number of investigational products into the development pipeline. Combined efforts are required of investigators, industry, patients' representatives, research institutions, and regulatory authorities to overcome all bottlenecks associated with clinical trials in low-prevalence conditions. Among the incentives provided by orphan designations, protocol assistance and scientific advice from regulatory bodies play a key role in guiding the conduct of studies to address the benefit/risk analysis for marketing authorization and approval. Thanks to these strategies, in the US, 47% and 41% of novel drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2015 and 2016, respectively, were for rare indications. The trend observed in the success rates of clinical development between 2006 and 2015 in the US shows higher rates of approval for orphan products moving on from one phase of clinical studies to another when compared to drugs for chronic conditions.

Models

Currently, we only understand the biological function of a fraction of human genes. Animal and cellular models, including humanized models, provide insight into the function of genes and the mechanisms underlying rare diseases can be manipulated experimentally much more readily than humans for both ethical and technical reasons, allowing important questions that cannot be addressed in patients to be approached. Model systems enable experimental interventions that can establish causal mechanisms of gene action, thereby putting disease genes into biological context and can yield pathologic insight that facilitates the development of targeted therapeutics.

### Can you hear us now? The impact of health-care utilization by rare disease patients in the United States [^116jwcfr]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Study limitations

The overall cost of RDs is likely larger than the current HCUP utilization analysis. HCUP estimate charges likely underestimate the true costs of these conditions because they do not factor direct costs such as professional (e.g. physician, dentist, and other clinicians) fees, indirect costs (e.g. lost work productivity), and secondary downstream health-care effects.

HCUP databases are useful for giving estimates on a national scale. There are, however, several limitations of HCUP sample data: (1) the frequencies represent hospital discharges, and not patients, and thus, recurrent hospitalizations by the same patient appear as distinct observations; (2) the prevalence data may be affected by hospital coding; (3) databases do not capture outpatient encounters, and the full health-care utilization of patients suffering from RDs is underrepresented; (4) data do not represent the complete universe of all discharges in the United States since not all states participate; (5) hospital charges represent the bill that is sent to the payer, not the actual cost to the hospital which may vary, depending on reimbursement, if any; (6) the number of rare conditions included in this study primarily correspond to ICD-10 codes provided by Orphanet, which is far from the nearly 7,000–10,000 rare conditions currently described; (7) patients with undiagnosed rare conditions are not included in the RD cohort; (8) conditions are heterogeneous and genetic basis may affect only a disease subpopulation; (9) the ICD-10 codes used also include CC, which are unable to be separated from RDs, and thus are included in the health-care utilization and cost data reported here; and (10) we did not distinguish conditions in Table S3 that are indicated as having a genetic basis due to genetic susceptibility, genetic role in the phenotype, or disease-causing somatic mutation(s) from those with disease-causing germline mutation(s).

### Clinical practice guidelines: diagnosis, treatment, and management of children and adults with central auditory processing disorder [^114aJTXJ]. AAA (2010). Medium credibility.

Reimbursement for central auditory testing — For behavioral central auditory testing, current procedure terminology (CPT) codes listed in the January 2009 CPT Manual apply: the first hour of administering, interpreting, and/or providing test results falls under CPT code 92620, with each additional 15 minute increment billed under CPT code 92621, and a maximum of eight additional units is allowed by many third party payers; billing for counseling is allowed only if it occurs on the same day as testing, and billing for report writing should be limited to a maximum of 15–30 minutes. Medicare reimburses diagnostic procedures conducted only for medically-necessary reasons; commercial payers tend to follow Medicare guidelines, but also have the latitude to deviate from Medicare, and as such, commercial payers are not obligated to reimburse for auditory processing testing. Because coverage varies, testing should not be completed without obtaining prior authorization or pre-certification, and when an insurer denies payment, audiologists should provide information to the insurer documenting the clinical efficacy of central auditory testing and how the results of an accurate (C)APD diagnosis will decrease insurance costs in the long run; coverage also varies across states for Medicaid and state-offered insurance plans for children.

### "Patient journeys": improving care by patient involvement [^111CXMEf]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

"I will not be ashamed to say ' I don't know', nor will I fail to call in my colleagues… " For centuries this quotation from the Hippocratic oath, has been taken by medical doctors. But what if there are no other healthcare professionals to call in, and the person with the most experience of the disease is sitting right in front of you: ' your patient '.

This scenario is uncomfortably common for patients living with a rare disease when seeking out health care. They are fraught by many hurdles along their health care pathway. From diagnosis to treatment and follow-up, their healthcare pathway is defined by a fog of uncertainties, lack of effective treatments and a multitude of dead-ends. This is the prevailing situation for many because for rare diseases expertise is limited and knowledge is scarce. Currently different initiatives to involve patients in developing clinical guidelines have been taken, however there is no common method that successfully integrates their experience and needs of living with a rare disease into development of healthcare services.

Even though listening to the expertise of a single patient is valuable and important, this will not resolve the uncertainties most rare disease patients are currently facing. To improve care for rare diseases we must draw on all the available knowledge, both from professional experts and patients, in order to improve care for every single patient in the world.

Patient experience and satisfaction have been demonstrated to be the single most important aspect in assessing the quality of healthcare, and has even been shown to be a predictor of survival rates. Studies have evidenced that patient involvement in the design, evaluation and designation of healthcare services, improves the relevance and quality of the services, as well as improves their ability to meet patient needs. Essentially, to be able to involve patients, the hurdles in communication and initial preconceptions between medical doctors and their patients need to be resolved.

### Factors associated with patients not receiving oral anticancer drugs [^116dngfk]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Data Collection

Demographic information (age, sex, race and ethnicity, tumor type, and insurance) was collected at the patient level, while prescription-specific information (prior authorization [PA], drug class, and years since FDA approval) was collected at the prescription level. Race and ethnicity were collected from patient-reported information and classified as non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic of any race, and other (including non-Hispanic Asian, Pacific Islander, and Alaska Native).

For data collection, a paper-based case report form was created for each patient, and the clinic nurses completed the forms over time until the delivery of the prescription. The information collected included the OACD prescription name, the date of the prescription, and the date of the delivery of the OACD or the failure date (the date when it was noted that the patient had not received the OACD). About one-third of the way into the study, a hospital-based specialty pharmacy was implemented at CUIMC to facilitate the procurement and delivery of the OACD. All OACD prescriptions from the oncology clinics were subsequently submitted directly to the hospital-based specialty pharmacy, which collected all of the information previously collected on the case report forms electronically.

Information about the reasons for the failure to receive a prescribed OACD within a 3-month period from time of prescription during the study was initially obtained from a database derived from the case report forms and the hospital-based specialty pharmacy. If the reasons were not clear, then we retrospectively performed a manual review of the outpatient oncology encounter notes and pharmacy notes. A group consensus was reached to categorize the reasons for a failure to receive a prescribed OACD into 7 distinct categories to highlight key reasons and reduce redundancy. These reasons for a failure to receive a prescribed OACD were categorized as (1) clinical deterioration (death or hospice), (2) financial access (issues with insurance and affordability), (3) clinician-directed change in decision-making (oncologists opting for a different drug or clinical trial), (4) patient-directed change (patients pursuing different treatments), (5) transfer of care (patients pursuing care at another institution), (6) loss to follow-up, and (7) unknown or other (used when the reason for failure to receive a prescribed OACD was not clear in the EHR). Any patient who had missing data for the primary outcome or covariates was excluded from the study.

### Newborn screening 50 years later: access issues faced by adults with PKU [^117JMfyd]. Genetics in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Despite an increase in health and neuropsychiatric issues affecting adults with poor metabolic control, these concerns are rarely lethal, and those with PKU typically have a normal life span regardless of treatment status. Therefore, disparity between prevalence of PKU based on health statistics and the number of adults reported by metabolic clinics is not primarily due to morbidity in the patient population. This disparity may, in part, be due to the dramatic changes in treatment recommendations and clinical guidelines over time. Previous recommendations for early discontinuation of treatment likely resulted in the loss to follow-up of many adults with PKU. Because many metabolic clinics report that they do not see adult patients, (Table 2) and some clinics associated with children's hospitals are not allowed to see adults, the vast majority of adults with PKU are not being followed by a metabolic clinic and encounter difficulties locating clinics able to accept new adult patients with PKU. Such was the case in 2008–2009 when the author J.K. helped a veteran find a clinic when he was unable to be treated at Children's Hospital of Los Angeles because his metabolic physician was not permitted to treat adult patients.

In addition to the inability to access a metabolic clinic, results of the current study clearly identify a lack of or limited insurance coverage for required medical food therapy as a significant and primary barrier for the treatment of adults with PKU, (Table 3). Only 50% of the states in the United States provide coverage of both required medical food and modified special low-protein food products, and almost 35% do not provide any coverage for these therapies for adults with PKU. Even for those states that do have mandated coverage, barriers to access to medical formula and low-protein special foods may exist for the patient from employer self-insured plans, which do not have to comply with state-imposed mandates. We do not know whether a causal relationship exists between third-party health insurance coverage and access to clinics; however, the contribution of this factor is supported by the literature, as well as by our own experience.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 5 health care abroad [^113kAfQt]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

American Medical Association's guiding principles on medical tourism — employers, insurance companies, and other entities that facilitate or incentivize medical care outside the United States should adhere to the following principles: Receiving medical care outside the United States must be voluntary; financial incentives to travel outside the United States for medical care should not inappropriately limit the diagnostic and therapeutic alternatives that are offered to patients or restrict treatment or referral options; patients should only be referred for medical care to institutions that have been accredited by recognized international accrediting bodies (e.g., the Joint Commission International or the International Society for Quality in Health Care); prior to travel, local follow-up care should be coordinated, and financing should be arranged to ensure continuity of care when patients return from medical care outside the United States; coverage for travel outside the United States for medical care should include the costs of necessary follow-up care upon return to the United States; patients should be informed of their rights and legal recourse before agreeing to travel outside the United States for medical care; access to physician licensing and outcome data, as well as facility accreditation and outcome data, should be arranged for patients seeking medical care outside the United States; the transfer of patient medical records to and from facilities outside the United States should be consistent with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) guidelines; patients choosing to travel outside the United States for medical care should be provided with information about the potential risks of combining surgical procedures with long flights and vacation activities.

### Insurance denials and diagnostic rates in a pediatric genomic research cohort [^113Lo69U]. Genetics in Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study aimed to assess the amount and types of clinical genetic testing denied by insurance and the rate of diagnostic and candidate genetic findings identified through research in patients who faced insurance denials.

Methods

Analysis consisted of review of insurance denials in 801 patients enrolled in a pediatric genomic research repository with either no previous genetic testing or previous negative genetic testing result identified through cross-referencing with insurance prior-authorizations in patient medical records. Patients and denials were also categorized by type of insurance coverage. Diagnostic findings and candidate genetic findings in these groups were determined through review of our internal variant database and patient charts.

Results

Of the 801 patients analyzed, 147 had insurance prior-authorization denials on record (18.3%). Exome sequencing and microarray were the most frequently denied genetic tests. Private insurance was significantly more likely to deny testing than public insurance (odds ratio = 2.03 [95% CI = 1.38–2.99] P = 0.0003). Of the 147 patients with insurance denials, 53.7% had at least 1 diagnostic or candidate finding and 10.9% specifically had a clinically diagnostic finding. Fifty percent of patients with clinically diagnostic results had immediate medical management changes (5.4% of all patients experiencing denials).

Conclusion

Many patients face a major barrier to genetic testing in the form of lack of insurance coverage. A number of these patients have clinically diagnostic findings with medical management implications that would not have been identified without access to research testing. These findings support re-evaluation of insurance carriers' coverage policies.

### Impact of prior authorization for asthma medications on the use of emergency health services: a retrospective cohort study among newly diagnosed patients with asthma [^1119LVyk]. Clinical Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

A prior authorization process to limit the nonoptimal use of medications combining inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators was introduced in the province of Québec, Canada, on October 1, 2003.

Objective

We assessed the impact of this administrative measure on the rate of asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted using Régie de l'assurance maladie du Québec administrative databases. We identified all persons aged 6 to 44 years with an incident asthma diagnosis in the 2-year periods preceding (October 1, 2001-September 30, 2003) and following (October 1, 2003-September 30, 2005) the introduction of the process. Children aged ≤ 5 years at the time of the first encountered diagnosis were excluded because it is difficult to make an objective asthma diagnosis until 6 years of age. People aged ≥ 45 years at the time of the first encountered diagnosis were also excluded to avoid the inclusion of persons who might also have had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Two groups were created based on their prescription drug insurance (private or public). Publicly insured persons were considered exposed to the process while privately insured persons were considered not exposed. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess, for each insurance group, the hazard ratio (HR) for an asthma-related first hospitalization or ED visit between the 2 periods. The use of medication, quality of life, and visits to physicians' offices were not considered in the analysis. The interaction between group and period was assessed to test whether the change in risk between the preprocess and postprocess periods differed by insurance group; statistical models were adjusted for sex, age, region, presence of a comorbidity other than asthma, and discipline of diagnosing physician.

Results

There were 47,579 publicly insured persons and 93,177 privately insured persons with incident asthma during the study period. The risk of an asthma-related first hospitalization or ED visit remained unchanged in the 2 periods evaluated among both the publicly insured (adjusted HR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.88–1.03]) and the privately insured (adjusted HR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.96–1.03]). The change in risk between the preprocess and postprocess periods was not significantly different between insurance groups.

Conclusions

The prior authorization process introduced to limit the nonoptimal use of combination products (formoterol/budesonide and salmeterol/fluticasone) had no apparent impact on first asthma-related hospitalization or ED visit in these patients newly diagnosed with asthma who were covered by Québec's public prescription drug insurance plan.

### Insurance denials and patient treatment in a large academic radiation oncology center [^113XujME]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Methods

This cohort study was approved by the institutional review board of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York. Informed consent was waived given that the research involved minimal risk to the participants and data will be deidentified upon completion of the study, with a link to the data kept in a secured database. The study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

Patients

All patients were seen in a large, quaternary referral, academic cancer center and/or affiliated regional centers. The records of 206 patients (of a total 15 693 cases referred to the billing department) seen between November 1, 2021, and December 8, 2022, were extracted from an institutional registry of patient cases with insurance denials for RT (Table 1). Identification of participant race was performed by the corresponding author (J.Y.S), and the source of the classifications used was the patient electronic health record. Self-identified racial categories included Asian, Black, White, other (including American Indian or Alaska Native, Hispanic, and those classifying themselves as other race), and unknown race. Race was assessed in this study to investigate any possible racial disparities with regard to insurance denial and RT, and data were collected via the patient electronic health record.

Table 1.
Profile of Cases

Prior Authorization

Prior authorization requests with relevant clinical information were submitted either online (Web Portal) or by telephone to the patient's insurer prior to treatment initiation. Clinical RT modalities requiring PA included SBRT, IMRT, SRS, 3-dimensional–conformal RT (3D-CRT), 2D-RT (conventional therapy), and brachytherapy. Requested clinical information, including diagnosis codes, disease-specific clinical information, and intended treatment plan (including treatment technique, dose, and number of radiation fractions), were submitted via insurer-provided physician worksheets. Insurer authorization outcomes were faxed (or electronically faxed) to the ordering and/or rendering physician.

### Use of a commercially available clinical decision support tool to expedite prior authorization in partnership with a private payer [^1143Hhhc]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to determine if a clinical decision support (CDS) tool could be used in partnership with a private payer to successfully expedite the prior authorization process for advanced (ie, MRI, CT, PET, nuclear medicine) imaging requests.

Methods

A single academic institution integrated a commercially available CDS tool utilizing the ACR Appropriateness Criteria into the ordering process for outpatient advanced imaging tests within the electronic health record. Ordering providers could elect to use the CDS tool or ignore the available technology. In partnership with a health care insurance company and a contracted radiology benefits management company, orders deemed as "usually indicated" by the CDS tool underwent expedited prior authorization in a pilot program from June 2018 to October 2019.

Results

Providers used the CDS tool for 15% (1,453 of 9,640) of outpatient advanced imaging orders. Of these orders with elective CDS scores, 69% (n = 997) qualified for an expedited prior authorization process.

Conclusions

Under specific circumstances, a commercially available CDS tool was used in partnership with a private payer and a radiology benefits management company to expedite prior authorization of outpatient advanced imaging examination orders deemed likely to be appropriate by multispecialty professional guidelines.

### Decision makers' perceptions of integrating genetic counselors into primary care [^11471ZUD]. Family Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

The MoC highlights what a GC's role in a primary care setting might look like and what tasks would be best suited to them based on their expertise (e.g. patient education, health promotion counseling for comment complex conditions, etc.). For instance, because GCs are likely more familiar with criteria for a genetic referral to different specialties (e.g. cancer, cardiology, or neurology), it may be beneficial for a GC to take on common primary care tasks like collecting detailed family histories. Despite being provided this information prior to interviews, participants struggled to envision the roles a GC might play in a primary care clinic. Documentation of an in-depth family history was often not seen as directly related to genetic healthcare, or as a valuable specialized skill of GCs. While PCHPs often record family histories for their patients, they often have competing priorities within an appointment and limited time to do so. In addition to informing counseling around health promotion, taking high quality, multi generation family histories is key to identifying eligibility criteria for genetic testing, personalized screening recommendations for health conditions, and referrals to other specialty care. GCs are specifically trained in this skill and have the potential to act as a "physician extender" and improve the quality of patient care.

Similarly, participants often perceived genetic counseling as only being relevant to rare diseases, again, despite explicit description in the MOC that they reviewed prior to the interview highlighting the role of genetic counseling for common complex conditions. The challenges participants faced in integrating the ideas presented in the MOC into their understanding of genetic counseling suggests the potential for deeper issues — that may not be related to informational needs (i.e. emotional reactions to the concept of "genetic counseling") — to be playing a role in barriers to the implementation of the proposed MOC. A critical aspect to successful integration in primary care settings would be for other members of the healthcare team to have a complete understanding of the top of scope of practice of a GC in this context and the development of clear guidelines for the types of patients that would be appropriate for a GC to see.

### PCSK9 inhibitor access barriers-issues and recommendations: improving the access process for patients, clinicians and payers [^115M57N8]. Clinical Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

4 PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS, STEP THERAPY, AND THE APPEALS PROCESS

Formulary restrictions 52 have been employed by insurance providers as a strategy to limit use of more costly medications. Three principal measures creating barriers to access include the requirement of PAs, step therapy (commonly dubbed "fail first"), and a burdensome appeals process. Happe et al provided a systematic literature review assessing the impact of managed care formulary restrictions on medication adherence, clinical outcomes, economic outcomes, and healthcare resource utilization, concluding, "There is a strong evidence base demonstrating a negative correlation between formulary restrictions and medication adherence outcomes". 53 Thus, PAs and other insurance‐based cost‐containment strategies are actually undermining our ability to properly care for patients. This section reveals various challenges created by each of these practices. 53

4.1 Prior authorization

The PA has become a nearly universal tool to limit patient access to medications. PAs require that healthcare practitioners collect specific data deemed necessary for medication approval. Complex paperwork (up to 17 pages in the case of the PCSK9 mab) often delays or discourages patient access to newer or more costly drugs. Justification of the PA process by payers includes the assertion that this process is necessary to avoid potential overuse of medications. 10 Prior to the FDA's approval of the PCSK9 mab, ICER predicted that the medications would cost insurers $1.2 billion within their first year on the market. The actual cost was $83 million, just 1.2% of what had been projected. Based on their inaccurate prediction, ICER advised insurers to use the PA as a primary barrier to access. 3 This strategy, though effective, can inadvertently undermine the patient clinician relationship, which is in part based on access to therapies appropriately prescribed by a clinician and deemed essential to the care of a patient.

Appropriate use ratings — interpretation and documentation — emphasize that an Appropriate rating does not mean that a given procedure has to be performed, nor does a Rarely Appropriate rating mean a procedure should never be performed; rather, an Appropriate rating should be seen as an option if the information may be useful, and for a Rarely Appropriate rating there may be additional clinical circumstances that dictate the need for testing, for which it is recommended that such circumstances be documented clearly by the ordering clinician; moreover, the categories of May Be Appropriate and Rarely Appropriate should not be considered as grounds for denial of insurance coverage or reimbursement for a particular imaging study.

### Regional disparities in qualified health plans' prior authorization requirements for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis in the United States [^115rTdm3]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

The US Preventive Services Task Force's grade A recommendation for combined tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine as HIV PrEPwas released in June 2019. Beginning no later than 1 year after the final recommendation was released, all QHPs will be required to offer PrEP with no cost-sharing as a part of §2713 of the ACA. This requirement will be in place for QHPs that provide coverage starting in January 2021. Advocates have worried that the new preventive coverage requirement of PrEP may lead to insurers trying to limit access by using arbitrary, nonclinically based prior authorization requirements. Unfortunately, our research demonstrates that prior authorization is already being used by almost 20% of QHPs and that it is being used more often in the South.

Plan characteristics did not explain the differences in prior authorization use among the regions. The QHPs in the South are more likely to be offered by a national company, and approximately 50% of QHPs offered by national issuers require prior authorization for PrEP. This finding may explain part of the higher rate in the South, but it does not completely explain the disparity. The ACA includes nondiscrimination requirements that prohibit issuers from using arbitrary plan designs limiting access to care, such as adverse tiering that places all or most medications used to treat a specific condition on a specialty tier or excessive prior authorization. Regulators review issuers that are outliers in their use of prior authorization. However, this type of outlier analysis would not identify regional or state outliers. State insurance regulators or the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Civil Rights should examine why national issuers are putting additional barriers in place for PrEP in the South and whether this practice constitutes discriminatory plan design. For instance, regulators could evaluate whether prior authorization requirements are clinically justified based on CDC clinical recommendations for PrEP.

### Access to information cited in national organization for rare disorders reports [^114rxRDx]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Over the past 20 years, substantial steps have been taken to ensure public access to research results, including policies established by the US Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the National Institutes of Health. Patients with rare diseases and their caregivers play outsized roles in their medical care due to limited treatment options and specialists. Patient organizations, such as the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD), are essential to facilitating access to high-quality information for families. While NORD's disease-specific reports are publicly available, they provide only brief overviews; patients may seek the detailed information and research findings cited within the reports to inform clinical decision-making. Accordingly, this study examined the public availability and cost of accessing these cited information sources.

### Improving implementation of fertility preservation benefit mandates [^1116Pjc4]. JAMA Health Forum (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Following FP mandate passage, clinics across different state mandate contexts adapted to the availability of insurance coverage for FP services and reported a range of challenges to secure coverage from patients' health insurer, the most significant of which were time needed and health insurance navigation expertise. Findings inform clinic policies to support clinic and patient interactions with insurers, insurer policies to facilitate access, and state laws and regulatory actions to support compliance.

Building expertise on benefit verification, prior authorization, claims, appeals, and escalation processes for different health insurers were key facilitators for insurer-level barriers, which requires clinics to commit resources. To support patient-insurer interactions, patients can be provided with health insurance literacy tutorials, tip sheets for interacting with health insurers, benefit verification scripts, FP International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems and Current Procedural Terminology codes, provider identifiers and facilities identifiers for in-network status, and appeals letter templates. Clinics in all 3 states reported confusion between infertility and FP benefits as being a barrier to patient access, despite the existence of infertility benefit mandates in New York and Illinois. This suggests the importance of written information on FP benefit mandates and the distinction between FP and infertility services for clinics and patients to educate insurers and facilitate access. The effectiveness of these strategies to increase access to mandated benefits is not known and warrants future trials. In the interim, clinics can review, select, and implement relevant identified determinants to facilitate access to FP services.

At the insurer level, health plan handbooks with clear identification and description of FP benefits would save clinics and patients time spent on benefit verification. Among benefit designs, significant holes exist in comprehensive coverage of FP services, such that patients remain responsible for large out-of-pocket payments that go beyond copays. This points to the need to develop a model insurance benefit, based on scientific evidence, led by clinical organizations such as the American Society of Reproductive Medicine and American Society of Clinical Oncology. In 2008, the US Public Health Service produced a Clinical Practice Guideline on Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence. This guideline made specific, evidence-based recommendations related to insurance coverage and health system strategies to treat tobacco use and dependence. The development of a similar guideline for FP benefits could be useful for insurer policies on benefit design and state regulations for implementing mandates.

### Drugs against rare diseases: are the regulatory standards higher? [^116AjVcJ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Progressive licensing would allow the clinical‐development program to be restructured to allow for early approval for a population of higher‐risk patients. Approval would be revisited at additional checkpoints along the development pathway as additional data from the approved population(s), as well as new data from broadened candidate populations, is assessed. A progressive licensing pathway would shift the focus from premarket assessment to one of continual learning. The challenges to implement such a system are nontrivial and the evolution of science and technology would require buy‐in across industry, regulatory, payer, and all other parties involved. Progressive licensing should differ from the Subpart H provision in the accrual of safety and efficacy data not only for the first treatment for a rare disease but also the subsequent ones. We believe a Congressional mandate is required before the FDA can pursue progressive licensing. Perhaps the patient advocacy groups should present this issue.

### Twelve-month analysis of real-world evidence from a telehealth obesity-treatment provider using antiobesity medications [^115f1f88]. Obesity (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment program

Sequence, a multidisciplinary telehealth medical weight‐management program that started in 2022, was acquired by WW International, Inc. in 2023 and is now WeightWatchers (WW) Clinic. A flowchart detailing the patient enrollment and treatment flow is presented in Figure S1. Briefly, prospective WW Clinic members begin by taking a 5‐min online quiz to evaluate whether they medically qualify for the program. The requirements for medical qualification for the program aligned with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines for AOMs of having BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or BMI ≥ 27 kg/m² with a related comorbidity such as prediabetes, hyperlipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, or hypertension. If deemed a potential candidate for treatment, patients provide weight verification and meet virtually with a board‐certified clinician who has undergone screening and training, including a screener for obesity bias and stigma, education in the pathophysiology and pharmacology of obesity, electronic medical record training, and biweekly clinical case reviews and policy update meetings. The clinician then assesses whether the patient is medically appropriate for AOMs and, if so, for which ones. Providers engage in patient‐centered care and decision‐making, and medications are prescribed based on a variety of factors, including medical history, insurance coverage, patient needs and goals, and recommended starting dosage and titration maximum for GLP‐1 medications. Throughout the program, patients' care is supported by care team coordinators, and patients have access to registered dietitians and fitness specialists to develop personalized nutrition and fitness plans. Patients interact with a clinician monthly (but more as needed) for regular check‐ins, including a side effects checklist, to adjust treatment plans. Patients also have access to the program's app, enabling real‐time tracking of progress, nutrition, and physical activity; instant messaging with their care team for assistance; and prescription refill requests. The program cost is $99/month, paid directly by the patient, and includes the clinical care; generic, nonschedule IV AOMs (e.g. bupropion/naltrexone, metformin); registered dietitian and fitness specialist visits; care coordination; assistance with prior authorization; and location of medications when supply is constrained. When prescribed, GLP‐1 medications are covered by insurance or directly by patients, with monthly out‐of‐pocket costs of up to $1350 for Wegovy (semaglutide) and $1060 for Zepbound (tirzepatide).

### Regional disparities in qualified health plans' prior authorization requirements for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis in the United States [^116i47aS]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

As part of utilization management, insurance companies can require prior authorization, which involves the clinician or office staff obtaining prior approval from the insurance company for the coverage of prescription medication. Through this process, clinicians must justify the medication as medically necessary and may be asked to document that the patient meets specified clinical criteria. This process often needs to occur before a patient can receive the medication from the pharmacy. Prior authorization requirements have been shown to reduce both necessary and unnecessary medication use.

The objective of this study was to assess whether there are regional differences in QHPs' use of prior authorization requirements for combined tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine that may contribute to the decreased PrEP uptake in the South. In addition, we sought to assess whether any QHP characteristics could explain regional disparities in prior authorization requirements.

### Magnetic resonance imaging prior authorizations for orthopaedic care are negatively affected by medicaid insurance status [^113a3MHb]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). Medium credibility.

Background:

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revolutionized musculoskeletal care. However, its high costs and high utilization has prompted many insurance payors to require a prior authorization. This process remains burdensome and results in delays to patient care. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between several variables and the denial rate of outpatient MRI prior authorization requests from a single institution's department of orthopaedics.

Methods:

MRI prior authorization insurance data was retrospectively collected from January 2019 to December 2022. Patient demographics, imaging characteristics, and insurance details were extracted and stratified into generalized categories. Analysis of variance, multivariate logistic regression models, and odds ratios (ORs) were used to predict the likelihood of request denial with α = 0.05.

Results:

Of the 17,913 total MRI prior authorization requests identified, 885 (4.94%) were denied. Race and socioeconomic status were not markedly different between the authorized and denied cohorts; however, primary insurance payor, chief symptom, and anatomic location to be imaged were found to have notable differences between authorized and denied cohorts (P < 0.0001). MRIs of the spine were less likely to be authorized compared with the shoulder (OR 0.51), upper extremity (OR 0.43), knee (OR 0.38), lower extremity (OR 0.34), and foot and ankle (OR 0.75) with P < 0.02 for each. Horizon NJ Health and Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield, both Medicaid payors, were also less likely to authorize requests compared with other payors (Aetna, OR 0.37 and United Healthcare, OR 0.36) (P < 0.01 for both).

Conclusion:

The low denial rate of initial prior authorization requests over 4 years at our institution underscores the questionable utility of the prior authorization process. Our results are consistent with the current literature that has reported higher rates of denials for MRI prior authorization requests of the spine. Although we were not able to quantify the effect of these denials on patient care, the overall time required to process these requests undoubtedly causes delays in patient care. despite no notable difference seen in socioeconomic status, Horizon NJ Health, a major provider of only Medicaid insurance plans at our institution, was associated with a higher likelihood of denial. This suggests that MRI prior authorization requests submitted for Medicaid patients are more likely to be denied and cause an inequitable delay in care due to this process.

### The personal physician's role in helping patients with medical conditions stay at work or return to work [^111dApWF]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Workers' compensation — patient confidentiality and information sharing: In general, the physician should not give information to anyone concerning the condition of a patient or any service rendered to a patient without the patient's consent, though laws in most jurisdictions provide for at least a partial waiver of the right to medical confidentiality for workers' compensation claims, usually limited to information specific to a particular workers' compensation claim. Regarding workers' compensation, HIPAA states that physicians may disclose protected health information to workers' compensation insurers, State administrators, employers, and others involved in the workers' compensation systems without the patient's consent as necessary to comply with state or federal laws, but the disclosure must be limited to the minimum necessary information and protected health information should be shared on a need-to-know basis based on the recipient's role in the system; a physician may always choose to request a HIPAA and state law compliant authorization from the patient authorizing the disclosure of information. The physician should make an effort to support the reasonable business processes of the employer and insurers by obtaining authorizations and tailoring reports to the audience — for example, a report directed to a patient's work supervisor should only contain what that supervisor needs to know, and most often, an estimate of work capacity, medical restrictions, and functional limitations will suffice, whereas reports directed to benefits or claims administrators should also contain all diagnostic and treatment information reasonably necessary to evaluate and adjudicate claims. The patient usually has the right to examine and obtain copies of his or her medical records, and the physician should routinely provide the patient with a copy of all activity prescriptions and employment-related forms prepared for the employer or benefits/claims administrator.

### Current status of transition preparation among youth with special needs in the United States [^114amSxR]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine current US performance on transition from pediatric to adult health care and discuss strategies for improvement.

Methods

The 2009–2010 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs is a nationally representative sample with 17114 parent respondents who have youth with special health care needs (YSHCN) ages 12 and 18. They are asked about transition to an adult provider, changing health care needs, increasing responsibility for health care needs, and maintaining insurance coverage. We analyzed the association of selected characteristics with successful transition preparation.

Results

Overall, 40% of YSHCN meet the national transition core outcome. Several factors are associated with transition preparation, including female gender; younger age; white race; non-Hispanic ethnicity; income ≥ 400% of poverty; little or no impact of condition on activities; having a condition other than an emotional, behavioral, or developmental condition; having a medical home; and being privately insured.

Conclusions

Most YSHCN are not receiving needed transition preparation. Although most providers are encouraging YSHCN to assume responsibility for their own health, far fewer are discussing transfer to an adult provider and insurance continuity. Although changes in sample design limit trend analysis, there have been no discernible improvements since this transition outcome was measured in the 2005–2006 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs. The 2011 release of the American Academy of Pediatrics/American Academy of Family Physicians/American College of Physicians clinical recommendations on transition, new transition tools, and the spread of medical home should stimulate future improvements in transition performance.

### Evaluation of exome sequencing criteria for hospital stewardship and insurance authorization at a pediatric hospital [^114LVTLz]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Context —

Genomic molecular testing practices in a pediatric tertiary care institution can vary in utility by patient indication.

Objective —

To evaluate exome sequencing (ES) ordering practices and the effects of applying criteria to support ES stewardship. Exome sequencing can provide molecular diagnostic information for patients with known or suspected genetic diseases, but it is relatively expensive, and the cost is often borne by patients, institutions, and payers.

Design —

We examined ordering patterns of ES approved by board-certified geneticists at our tertiary pediatric care center, as well as preauthorization outcomes for ES requests. We compared positivity rates among patients by patient phenotype, composite insurance coverage criteria, and insurance preauthorization outcome.

Results —

Patients who met composite coverage criteria were more likely to receive a positive result from ES compared to patients who did not meet composite coverage criteria, though this trend was not statistically significant. There was no significant difference in ES results between patients who were denied or not denied preauthorization by insurance payers.

Conclusions —

Insurance payers should consider implementing and/or expanding coverage criteria for ES, and institutions should implement stewardship programs to support appropriate ES practices.

### Factors affecting therapeutic decisions in intermediate and posterior uveitis [^117KhZ3T]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate whether cost, insurance prior authorization, pregnancy considerations, and subspecialty practice lead to changes in therapeutic decisions among uveitis and retina specialists in the treatment of intermediate and posterior uveitis.

Design

Prospective cross-sectional study.

Methods

A total of 934 uveitis and retina specialists across the United States were surveyed via e-mail regarding their choice in long-term therapy for 3 hypothetical patients with uveitic conditions (Behçet disease, birdshot retinochoroiditis, and intermediate uveitis). Respondents were asked to select first- and second-choice therapies and then reselect first and second choices assuming cost of all options was equal to the patient and there would be no issues with insurance prior authorization. In 1 case, they were additionally asked for their treatment preferences if the patient desired a pregnancy. Outcomes of interest were differences in therapy choice based on cost/prior authorization, pregnancy, and subspecialty practice.

Results

One hundred and six respondents (11.3%) completed the survey; 44 were uveitis specialists and 62 retina specialists. Cost and prior authorization affected the therapy choices of uveitis specialists treating ocular Behçet disease (P = 0.008). Uveitis specialists and retina specialists differed in their first choice in therapy for each vignette when cost and prior authorization were equalized (P = 0.0018, P = 0.0049, and P = 0.0156). Both uveitis specialists and retina specialists changed their therapeutic choices for intermediate uveitis when pregnancy was a consideration (P = 0.00001 for uveitis specialists, P = 0.0044 for retina specialists).

Conclusions

Physician decision making in intermediate and posterior uveitis is affected by cost and prior authorization concerns, pregnancy considerations, and subspecialty practice.

### Barriers to optimizing inflammatory bowel disease care in the United States [^112qZBRk]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Barriers to care for patients with IBD

Fail-first policies or step therapy

Despite the consensus shift in IBD management away from a 'step-up' approach as is evident in US gastroenterology societies' clinical practice guidelines, the majority of insurance companies in the United States still require patients to try and fail lower cost medications such as corticosteroids, mesalamines, and thiopurines before approving biologics or small molecule therapies. In a review of 50 insurance policies, nearly all (98% for UC; 90% for CD) were inconsistent with the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) guidelines and require step-wise drug failure before anti-tumor necrosis factor approval. Furthermore, approximately 30% of policies require the failure of at least two drugs before biologic approval, adding another barrier to optimization of care and exposing patients unnecessarily to ineffective medications. Although these policies may drive down medication-related costs, they only serve to drive up disease-related costs in the long term as delays in appropriate care lead to increased rates of surgery and hospitalization.

In a pediatric study (n = 190), the prior authorization process was associated with a delay of 10.2 [95% confidence interval (CI): 8.2–12.3] days, which, in turn, led to a 24.6 (95% CI: 16.4–32.8)-day increase in time-to-biologic initiation. A subsequent adult study of 1693 authorizations showed similar delays of a median 11 [interquartile range (IQR): 6–20] days, but the length of delay increased with each level of appeal that was required [first appeal: 29 (IQR: 17–48) days; second level appeal: 51 (IQR: 27–84) days; external review: 73 (IQR: 28–98) days]. A quality improvement initiative within 18 adult IBD providers aimed at improving time-to-biologic- and small-molecule administration found that the insurance approval process step was not improved and actually lengthened over time despite their shortening time to medication administration by 4 days through streamlined internal processes. Within the pediatric study, they examined the impact of medication delays on IBD-related healthcare utilization within 6 months from the delay, and those who required prior authorization had a 13% (95% CI: 2.5–23.4) increase in healthcare utilization after adjusting for demographics and disease-severity characteristics.

### Strategic operational redesign for successfully navigating prior authorization barriers at a large-volume proton therapy center [^114vVr73]. JCO Oncology Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Prior authorization (PA) can be a resource-intensive barrier to oncologic care. To improve patient access and reduce delays at our large, academic proton therapy center, we implemented a novel payor-focused strategy to efficiently navigate the PA process while eliminating physician burden and reducing inappropriate denials.

Methods

In 2017, business operations were redesigned to better reflect the insurance process: (1) certified medical dosimetrists (CMDs), with their unique treatment expertise, replaced our historical PA team to function as an effective interface among physicians, patients, and payors; (2) a structured, tiered timeline was implemented to hold payors accountable to PA deadlines; and (3) our PA team provided administrative leadership with requisite insurance knowledge. PA outcomes were compared 6 months before and after the intervention.

Results

After implementation of this multifaceted strategy, the median time to successful appeal (after initial denial of coverage) decreased from 30 to 18 days (P < .001), and the total number of overturned denials increased by 56%. Because of the efficiency of the CMDs, full-time equivalents on the PA team actually decreased by 44%, translating to a 34% reduction in team personnel expenses. Internal referrals increased by 29%, attributable to optimized communication and diminished administrative burden for providers. New treatment starts also increased, resulting in a 37% larger patient census on treatment.

Conclusion

Incorporating payor-focused strategies can improve patient access in a cost-effective manner while decreasing time and administrative burden associated with the PA process. These operational concepts can be adapted for other oncologic practice settings facing analogous PA-related obstacles.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 5 health care abroad [^111EgFAz]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Medical tourism — pre-travel consultation — Medical tourists should take steps before they travel to reduce risk of an adverse health outcome. At a minimum, those considering medical tourism should have a discussion with their primary healthcare professional in the United States well in advance of travel, and medical tourists also could consult a travel medicine specialist for travel advice tailored to their specific health needs and destination 4–6 weeks before travel. Medical tourists should be up to date on all routine vaccinations, especially hepatitis B virus immunization. If consulted, the travel medicine specialist should discuss current medical conditions and ensure that the medical tourist will have a sufficient supply of all regular medications to last the duration of their trip. Medical tourists should discuss the plan for addressing complications related to the treatment or procedure with both their US healthcare professional and the healthcare professional performing the treatment or procedure outside the United States, and in addition, medical tourists should check their domestic health insurance plan carefully to understand what services, if any, are covered outside the United States. Travelers might need to purchase supplemental medical insurance coverage, including medical evacuation insurance, and medical tourists also should be aware that if complications develop, they might not have the same legal recourse as they would if they received their care in the United States. Remind medical tourists to request copies of their overseas medical records in English and to provide this information to any healthcare professionals they see subsequently for follow-up, and encourage medical tourists to disclose their entire travel history, medical history, and information about all surgeries or medical treatments received during their trip.

### Optimizing multidisciplinary care of patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus [^112iAjF6]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Issues during the process by which HCPs obtain prior authorization so patients can access services/treatments on their current healthcare plans poses an obstacle to timely CKD treatment initiation. In the 2021 American Medical Association survey, 88% of clinician respondents stated that the administrative burden of the prior authorizations process resulted in interruptions in chronic treatment for patients and interfered with continuity of care. Additionally, clinicians reported experiencing care delays, abandonment of treatment (by patients), and serious adverse events for patients in their care because of issues in the prior authorization processes. Thus, prior authorization issues can compound the complexities of medication management in patients with CKD.

Cost and Healthcare Insurance Plan Barriers

Having no healthcare insurance or a non-comprehensive healthcare plan is a barrier to accessing treatments for some patients with CKD and T2DM. However, even when a healthcare plan covers most new drugs in the year following their Food and Drug Administration approval (US FDA), patients' access to these drugs may still require prior authorization or step therapy. Additionally, chronic disease is associated with high healthcare utilization and, as a result, patients may incur high out-of-pocket expenses, which may prevent them from accessing certain drug treatments with demonstrated clinical efficacy. For example, results from a retrospective cohort study found that dialysis patients on Medicare Part D who needed to pay a higher co-payment upon reaching the coverage gap were significantly less likely to adhere to drug treatment and persist on their treatment plan due to significant out-of-pocket costs they incur, which is a major concern given the complex medical needs of these patients. Many patients receiving hemodialysis, and some older adults with CKD receiving Medicare benefits, may be eligible for the Part D low-income subsidy (LIS) that covers part or almost all Part D medication costs depending on a patient's income and assets. However, Medicare patients without the LIS can experience high premiums and co-payments. Many pharmaceutical companies offer patient assistance programs (PAPs) and/or discount cards for brand-name drugs for patients that have limited income or assets, but the requirements, paperwork, and length of the approval process for PAPs is often overwhelming for both patients and practitioners. The complexities of insurance and extra help programs contribute to treatment delays or treatment discontinuation.

### Guiding principles for managed care arrangements for the health of newborns, infants, children, adolescents and young adults [^114YAeu8]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Eligibility and treatment authorization — pediatric managed care plans — emphasize transparency and family engagement: managed care policies should be transparent and provide appropriate written, oral, and web-based information and counseling to current and potential beneficiaries, and the development of such policies should allow for meaningful input from providers, patients, and their families. Families and pediatricians should be fully informed of the plan's participating clinicians within the chosen network, including an up-to-date listing of participating health care professionals whose practices are currently accepting new patients, and the roster should be continuously updated with prompt deletion of nonparticipating providers; published information should also include resources on care coordination, community resources, and other services. Families should receive education at the time of enrollment to help them understand fully their health plan benefits, and carriers that offer multiple managed care plans should provide a clear comparison of pediatric benefits and networks so that families can choose a plan most appropriate for their needs; plans should develop materials with the advice and review of families using language that is easy for patients and families to understand, and materials should be available in the family's primary language. After enrollment, health insurance payment policies for providers should be clearly defined; managed care plans should provide details on the scope of pediatric benefits in consumer brochures, websites, benefit coverage documents, and managed care contracts, include Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) and diagnosis codes that clearly define covered services, and make fee schedules and formularies easily accessed and understood by providers, with accurate and up-to-date fee schedules. Managed care plans should provide accurate and reliable online patient eligibility data, timely authorization review, and transparent and efficient claims adjudication to allow for point-of-service payment information while preserving appropriate confidentiality when needed for care of adolescents and young adults; enrollment of newborn infants immediately following delivery allows for prompt access to care, and processes should be in place to ensure that newborn infants are recognized so as not to delay early preventive care. Managed care plans need to make every effort to provide timely and accurate verification of eligibility to the physician and should not retroactively rescind payments because of an internal plan error, and plans should be bound by their confirmation of eligibility so that physicians can expect payment once a clinic verifies eligibility. The treatment authorization process for elective services initiated by the primary care physician (PCP) should efficiently facilitate timely appropriate referral for specialty consultations, hospital inpatient and outpatient care, and other treatments.

### Magnetic resonance imaging prior authorizations for orthopaedic care are negatively affected by medicaid insurance status [^111xq8vV]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revolutionized musculoskeletal care. However, its high costs and high utilization has prompted many insurance payors to require a prior authorization. This process remains burdensome and results in delays to patient care. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between several variables and the denial rate of outpatient MRI prior authorization requests from a single institution's department of orthopaedics.

Methods

MRI prior authorization insurance data was retrospectively collected from January 2019 to December 2022. Patient demographics, imaging characteristics, and insurance details were extracted and stratified into generalized categories. Analysis of variance, multivariate logistic regression models, and odds ratios (ORs) were used to predict the likelihood of request denial with α = 0.05.

Results

Of the 17,913 total MRI prior authorization requests identified, 885 (4.94%) were denied. Race and socioeconomic status were not markedly different between the authorized and denied cohorts; however, primary insurance payor, chief symptom, and anatomic location to be imaged were found to have notable differences between authorized and denied cohorts (P < 0.0001). MRIs of the spine were less likely to be authorized compared with the shoulder (OR 0.51), upper extremity (OR 0.43), knee (OR 0.38), lower extremity (OR 0.34), and foot and ankle (OR 0.75) with P < 0.02 for each. Horizon NJ Health and Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield, both Medicaid payors, were also less likely to authorize requests compared with other payors (Aetna, OR 0.37 and United Healthcare, OR 0.36) (P < 0.01 for both).

Conclusion

The low denial rate of initial prior authorization requests over 4 years at our institution underscores the questionable utility of the prior authorization process. Our results are consistent with the current literature that has reported higher rates of denials for MRI prior authorization requests of the spine. Although we were not able to quantify the effect of these denials on patient care, the overall time required to process these requests undoubtedly causes delays in patient care. despite no notable difference seen in socioeconomic status, Horizon NJ Health, a major provider of only Medicaid insurance plans at our institution, was associated with a higher likelihood of denial. This suggests that MRI prior authorization requests submitted for Medicaid patients are more likely to be denied and cause an inequitable delay in care due to this process.

### Indications and management of preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic conditions: a committee opinion [^111F6Vxe]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). High credibility.

PGT-M laboratory selection — given the many nuanced differences between PGT laboratories and the highly individualized nature of PGT-M, it can be challenging for IVF providers to determine the optimal laboratory for a specific case, and clinic-based genetic counselors may provide patient-centered recommendations. Factors to consider may include technical considerations and limitations depending on the genes and variants of interest and/or availability of genetic relatives to participate in PGT-M test development; turnaround time of PGT-M test development and whether the laboratory can accommodate IVF cycle start before its completion; laboratory requirements for molecular and/or clinical documentation of the diagnosis for the proband and family members; and financial considerations such as insurance coverage, qualification for discounted or complimentary PGT-M, or cost-containment options such as batching. Depending on the reason cited, a PGT-M case that is not accepted by 1 laboratory could be referred to another laboratory for review, the test development of PGT-M is laboratory-specific and if the patient pursues PGT-M with a different laboratory, then test development must be repeated, and given the associated financial and timing implications, clinics are encouraged to work with the patient's original PGT-M laboratory.

### Ethical considerations in orphan drug approval and use [^112hg4wB]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

The Orphan Drug Act seeks to meet a utilitarian goal of advancing therapeutic options for patients with rare diseases. However, data show that orphan drugs are often approved with more limited premarket testing than that carried out for nonorphan drugs and consequently expose patients to more risk and less certain efficacy. Therefore, the ethical principles of justice and beneficence may require attention to informed consent among patients receiving the drugs and greater investment in postmarket surveillance and confirmational testing.
