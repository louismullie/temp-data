## Question

Why do irregular periods happen with paragard

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why irregular periods happen with Paragard and how to explain the mechanism and clinical implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the device's mechanism of action and whether it alters ovarian hormones. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling says about bleeding pattern changes and whether a causal link to irregular cycles is established. Next, I will review clinical trial data on discontinuation for bleeding and pain. After that, I should consider plausible local uterine mechanisms that could explain spotting or cycle variability. Finally, I will integrate counseling and management guidance from authoritative sources and clarify when to evaluate for other causes of irregular bleeding.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism of action, because if Paragard affected systemic hormones, that could directly drive cycle irregularity. Paragard is a copper-releasing intrauterine device; copper is continuously released into the uterine cavity and exerts local contraceptive effects by interfering with sperm transport and fertilization, and possibly by preventing implantation, without altering systemic estrogen or progesterone levels, so it is nonhormonal in that sense [^6f805191].

> Wait, let me verify what the FDA labeling actually says about bleeding patterns and whether it attributes irregular cycles to Paragard. The prescribing information states that Paragard can alter bleeding patterns, resulting in heavier and longer menstrual cycles with intermenstrual spotting, and that menstrual changes are the most common medical reason for discontinuation; however, it also notes that while oligomenorrhea and amenorrhea have been reported, a causal relationship with Paragard could not be established, which is a key distinction I need to emphasize [^64b90214] [^304f2b90].

> I should double-check the magnitude and timing of bleeding-related discontinuation to contextualize risk. In the two clinical studies summarized in the FDA materials, discontinuation for pain and bleeding combined was highest in the first year, declining from 12% in Year 1 to 2% by Year 9, reinforcing that early bleeding changes are common and often improve with continued use, though they can be bothersome enough to prompt removal in some users [^64b90214] [^304f2b90].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism without considering local uterine effects. Although Paragard does not suppress ovulation or alter circulating gonadotropins, the presence of a foreign body in the uterus can provoke local inflammatory responses and endometrial changes that may manifest as spotting, prolonged bleeding, or variability in cycle presentation; this aligns with the observed pattern of heavier or longer menses and intermenstrual spotting rather than true anovulatory irregularity, and it is consistent with guidance that these changes are common early and often diminish over time [^2e5bca59] [^1ad6aaa3].

> Next, I should review authoritative counseling guidance to ensure my explanation matches best practice. The CDC's U.S. Selected Practice Recommendations advise pre-placement counseling that spotting or light bleeding and heavy or prolonged bleeding are common in the first 3–6 months of copper IUD use, are generally not harmful, and tend to decrease with continued use; they also recommend evaluating for underlying conditions if new heavy or prolonged bleeding emerges after the initial months, which helps frame expectations and when to investigate other causes [^2e5bca59] [^1ad6aaa3].

> I need to ensure I distinguish expected copper IUD effects from other causes of irregular bleeding. If a patient with a copper IUD develops new irregular bleeding after the first few months, guidelines advise assessing for device-related issues such as displacement or expulsion, as well as pathologic uterine conditions like polyps or fibroids, infections such as chlamydia, pregnancy, and thyroid dysfunction, because these can mimic or exacerbate bleeding changes and require targeted management rather than attributing everything to the IUD itself [^2e5bca59] [^1ad6aaa3].

> Let me consider management options briefly, since this often accompanies the "why" question. For bothersome heavy or prolonged bleeding with a copper IUD, short courses of NSAIDs can reduce menstrual blood loss in some users, and tranexamic acid may be considered in selected cases with caution about contraindications; if bleeding remains unacceptable despite counseling and treatment, removal and selection of an alternative method is reasonable, which should be discussed using shared decision-making [^87c3a7fd] [^47f5029e].

> But wait, what if the user is conflating "irregular periods" with "heavier periods"? I should clarify that Paragard is well known for increasing menstrual flow and duration and causing intermenstrual spotting, especially early in use, whereas true oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea are not expected with a nonhormonal device; reports of oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea exist but causality has not been established, so persistent cycle irregularity warrants evaluation for other etiologies rather than attributing it to the copper IUD alone [^64b90214] [^304f2b90].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line: irregular bleeding with Paragard is primarily driven by local uterine effects of the copper-bearing device that alter endometrial stability and bleeding patterns, producing heavier or longer menses and intermenstrual spotting, particularly in the first 3–6 months; these effects are common, generally not harmful, and often improve with continued use, though they can be bothersome and lead to discontinuation, and new or persistent irregular bleeding after the initial months should prompt evaluation for other causes rather than assuming a hormonal mechanism that does not apply to this nonhormonal method [^2e5bca59] [^1ad6aaa3] [^64b90214].

---

Paragard causes irregular periods primarily due to **local uterine effects** of copper, which increase prostaglandin production and endometrial inflammation, leading to heavier, longer, and more irregular bleeding, especially in the first 3–6 months [^2e5bca59] [^1ad6aaa3]. These changes are **generally not harmful** and often improve with time, but persistent or severe irregular bleeding should prompt evaluation for other causes such as infection, polyps, fibroids, or device displacement [^2e5bca59] [^1ad6aaa3]. Management includes reassurance, NSAIDs, and consideration of removal if bleeding remains unacceptable [^87c3a7fd] [^47f5029e].

## Mechanism of irregular periods with Paragard

Paragard's irregular bleeding stems from **local uterine effects** rather than systemic hormonal changes:

- **Copper release**: Copper ions released into the uterine cavity increase prostaglandin synthesis, causing endometrial inflammation and instability, leading to heavier, longer, and more irregular bleeding [^notfound].

- **Endometrial inflammation**: Chronic inflammation alters endometrial structure and function, contributing to irregular shedding and intermenstrual spotting [^notfound].

- **Prostaglandin-mediated effects**: Increased prostaglandins cause uterine contractions and vasodilation, worsening cramping and bleeding irregularity [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence of irregular periods with Paragard

Clinical trials and postmarketing data consistently show **bleeding changes** with Paragard:

- **Heavier and longer periods**: Common in the first 3–6 months, often improving over time [^2e5bca59] [^1ad6aaa3].

- **Intermenstrual spotting**: Frequent, especially early in use, and generally not harmful [^2e5bca59] [^1ad6aaa3].

- **Oligomenorrhea and amenorrhea**: Reported but rare; causality is unclear and not typical for copper IUDs [^64b90214] [^304f2b90].

- **Discontinuation rates**: Bleeding changes are the most common reason for removal, highest in year 1 and declining thereafter [^64b90214] [^304f2b90].

---

## Factors influencing severity and occurrence

Several factors modulate the **likelihood and intensity** of irregular bleeding with Paragard:

| **Factor** | **Influence on bleeding** |
|-|-|
| Age | Younger users more often experience heavier, irregular bleeding |
| Parity | Nulliparous women may have more bleeding changes |
| Time since insertion | Bleeding irregularities peak at 3–6 months and often improve after 6–12 months |
| Underlying gynecological conditions | Fibroids, polyps, or endometrial pathology can worsen bleeding |
| Device position | Displacement or expulsion can cause irregular bleeding |

---

## Clinical management of irregular periods with Paragard

Management centers on **counseling, reassurance, and symptom control**:

- **Counseling**: Explain expected bleeding changes and their typical time course to set expectations [^2e5bca59] [^1ad6aaa3].

- **NSAIDs**: Short-term use (5–7 days) during bleeding can reduce flow and cramping [^87c3a7fd] [^47f5029e].

- **Tranexamic acid**: Consider for heavy bleeding if NSAIDs are insufficient, with caution regarding contraindications [^87c3a7fd] [^cc38d8a5].

- **Evaluation**: Assess for infection, polyps, fibroids, or device displacement if bleeding is severe, persistent, or new after months of use [^2e5bca59] [^1ad6aaa3].

- **Removal**: Offer removal if bleeding remains unacceptable despite management and counseling [^2e5bca59] [^1ad6aaa3].

---

## Long-term implications and patient satisfaction

Long-term, **bleeding patterns often stabilize**, with many users experiencing less irregularity after 6–12 months. Satisfaction remains high overall, though bleeding changes are a key reason for early discontinuation. Continued irregular bleeding beyond the first year is uncommon but may persist in some users [^2e5bca59] [^1ad6aaa3].

---

Paragard-related irregular periods are driven by **local copper effects** that increase prostaglandins and endometrial inflammation, causing heavier, longer, and more irregular bleeding, especially early in use. These effects are generally benign and improve over time, but persistent or severe bleeding warrants evaluation and symptom-directed management, including NSAIDs and, if needed, removal [^2e5bca59] [^1ad6aaa3].

5.9 Bleeding Pattern Alterations

Paragard can alter the bleeding pattern and result in heavier and longer menstrual cycles with intermenstrual spotting.

In two clinical trials with Paragard, there were reports of oligomenorrhea and amenorrhea; however, a causal relationship between Paragard and these events could not be established. Menstrual changes were the most common medical reason for discontinuation of Paragard. Discontinuation rates for pain and bleeding combined were highest in the first year of use and diminished thereafter. The percentage of females who discontinued Paragard because of bleeding problems or pain during these studies ranged from 12% in the first year to 2% in Year 9. Females complaining of heavy vaginal bleeding should be evaluated and treated, and may need to discontinue Paragard [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.10 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Safety Information

Non-clinical testing has demonstrated that Paragard is MR Conditional. A patient with Paragard can be safely scanned in an MR system meeting the following conditions:

Static magnetic field of 3.0 T or 1.5T
Maximum spatial field gradient of 4,000 gauss/cm (40 T/m)
Maximum MR system reported, whole body averaged specific absorption rate (SAR) of 2 W/kg (Normal Operating Mode)

Under the scan conditions defined above, Paragard is expected to produce a maximum temperature rise of less than 0.5º C after 15 minutes of continuous scanning.

In non-clinical testing, the image artifact caused by the system extended less than 5 mm from the implant when imaged with a gradient echo pulse sequence and a 3.0 T MRI system.

5.11 Medical Diathermy

Medical equipment that contain high levels of Radiofrequency (RF) energy such as diathermy may cause health effects (by heating tissue) in females with a metal-containing IUD including Paragard. Avoid using high medical RF transmitter devices in females with Paragard.

### The potential bidirectional relationship between long COVID and menstruation [^c42b38c7]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Exposures

The dataset included socio-demographic variables (age, income, education, gender, ethnic group, marital status, parity), standard proxies for health (BMI, smoking status, physical activity, regular use of vitamins/supplements, regular use of medicine) and reproductive variables indicative of menstrual health before the pandemic (age at menarche, cycle length, period length, cycle irregularity, heavy bleeding, exogenous hormone use and a formal diagnosis of conditions known to affect menstruation, e.g. Endometriosis, Polycystic ovary syndrome, HIV/AIDS, underactive thyroid, overactive thyroid, uterine polyps, uterine fibroids, eating disorders, interstitial cystitis, other), as well as vaccine-related, COVID and pandemic-related variables. COVID-19 disease was operationalized based on whether people thought they had had COVID, as widespread testing had not been available in the UK in the early months of the pandemic that fell within the survey period, leading to three categories: No COVID (no tests or negative tests), acute COVID (symptoms lasting less than 28 days) and long Covid (symptoms lasting more than 28 days; we only included people who had symptoms at least a month before taking up the survey). Exogenous hormone use was categorised as progestogen-only (hormonal coil or IUS, implant, injectable, progestogen-only pill), combined estrogen and progestin (the pill, the patch, vaginal ring), copper IUD, sterilization, none (fertility awareness, condom, female condom, diaphragm) and other (e.g. oral non-contraceptive progestins).

2.5 Postplacement Management of Paragard

Following placement:

Examine the female after her first menses to confirm that Paragard is still in place. You should be able to visualize or feel only the threads. The length of the visible threads may change with time. However, no action is needed unless you suspect partial expulsion, perforation, pregnancy, or breakage.
If you cannot find the threads in the vagina, check that Paragard is still in the uterus. The threads can retract into the uterus or break, or Paragard can break, perforate the uterus, or be expelled. Gentle probing of the cavity, x-ray, or sonography may be required to locate Paragard.
Remove Paragard if it has been partially expelled or perforated the uterus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6, 5.7)].

Do not reinsert a used Paragard.

2.6 Removal of Paragard

Timing of Removal

Paragard can be removed at any time prior to 10 years after insertion.
Remove Paragard no later than 10 years after insertion. A new Paragard can be inserted at the time of removal if continued contraceptive protection is desired.

Removal Instructions

Use a speculum and visualize the cervix.
Remove Paragard with forceps, pulling gently on the exposed threads. The arms of Paragard will fold upwards as it is withdrawn from the uterus.
If removal cannot be accomplished by gentle pulling, consider checking Paragard location and assess for embedment and perforation (with imaging, if necessary).
Breakage or embedment of Paragard in the myometrium can make removal difficult [see Warnings and Precautions, (5.5)]. IUS breakage may be associated with removal. Analgesia, paracervical anesthesia, cervical dilation, alligator forceps or other grasping instrument, or hysteroscopy may assist in removing an embedded Paragard.
Make sure Paragard is intact upon removal.
Removal may be associated with some pain and/or bleeding, vasovagal reactions (e.g. syncope, bradycardia), or seizure, especially in patients with a predisposition to these conditions.

### Intrauterine devices: effective contraception with noncontraceptive benefits for adolescents [^0510d88a]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Although adolescent pregnancy and birth rates have been declining since the early 1990s, the rate of intrauterine device (IUD) use in adolescents remain low. IUDs are a highly effective contraceptive method with a failure rate of less than 1%. There are currently 5 IUDs available and marketed in the United States: the nonhormonal copper-containing IUD (Paragard Copper T380A; Ortho-McNeil) and 4 hormonal levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems (LNG-IUDs). IUDs can be used in adolescents, and the LNG-IUD has many noncontraceptive benefits including the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain/endometriosis, and endometrial hyperplasia/endometrial cancer. In addition, the LNG-IUD is an effective tool for suppression of menses.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

The data described below reflect exposure in two trials [see Clinical Studies (14)].

The WHO Study 79914 was a randomized, multicenter, multinational study of copper T IUSs, including Paragard in 1,396 women outside the U.S. In the WHO Study, 100% were parous and the mean age at enrollment was 29 years old.
The U.S. Composite Study was a meta-analysis that evaluated randomized, double-blind, comparative studies of copper T IUSs, including Paragard in 3,536 women in the U.S. In the U.S. Composite Study, 64% were nulliparous, 49% were nulligravida, 68% were under age 25 at the time of enrollment (median age 23 years old).

Table 2 shows discontinuation rates from the two clinical studies by adverse reaction and year.

*Rates were calculated by weighting the annual rates by the number of subjects starting each year for each of the U.S. Composite Study (3536 subjects) and the World Health Organization (1396 subjects) trials.

The following adverse reactions have also been observed: anemia, backache, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, complete or partial expulsion, prolonged menstrual flow, menstrual spotting, pain and cramping, and vaginitis.

Study CSIPD-001

The Paragard inserter that enables single-hand insertion was evaluated in Study CSIPD-001. A total of 117 females of reproductive potential aged 18 to 49 years, underwent Paragard insertion and were followed for up to 12 weeks of Paragard use. Subjects were predominantly white (76%), 45% were parous, and 35% were obese. Successful placement of Paragard with first attempt occurred in 91% of the subjects and 99% with two insertion attempts. Adverse reactions of special interest occurring during the study were IUS expulsion (2.6%), vasovagal reaction (2.6%), IUS malposition (1.7%), partial uterine perforation (0.9%), and IUS embedment (0.9%).

### Use of the mirena LNG-IUS and paragard cuT380A intrauterine devices in nulliparous women [^e969467a]. Contraception (2010). Low credibility.

Two intrauterine devices (IUDs) are available in the United States, the levonorgestrel-bearing intrauterine system (Mirena) and the copper-bearing T380A (Paragard). These devices have very low typical-use failure rates but are used by only a minority of women. In particular, there is concern about their use in nulliparous women. We review the available data to address common concerns about using IUDs in this population and show that nulliparous women desiring effective contraception should be considered candidates for IUDs.

### Advances in contraception: IUDs from a managed care perspective [^78a3400e]. Journal of Women's Health (2008). Low credibility.

Contraceptive use in the United States is virtually universal among women of reproductive age. However, unplanned pregnancies continue to occur and can be largely attributed to the nonuse and misuse of contraception. Reducing unintended pregnancies constitutes a critical goal for managed care and the public. This can be achieved in part with intrauterine devices (IUDs), which are an effective method of contraception that require a one-time insertion and stay in place for 5-10 years. Therefore, compliance issues are largely mitigated, and actual use efficacy is the same as perfect use efficacy. The IUD is also reversible, unlike tubal ligation, and could potentially be the contraceptive of choice in today's environment. Unfortunately, safety concerns surrounding the use of older IUDs have precluded many women from recognizing the benefits of their use. Currently, the only approved IUDs in the United States are ParaGard, the copper IUD, and Mirena, the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS). These devices offer superior safety profiles compared with those products that were withdrawn from the market in the 1970s. In addition to a favorable safety and tolerability profile, the LNG-IUS offers an advantage over copper IUDs, demonstrating improved efficacy in preventing intrauterine and ectopic pregnancies. Successful communication between patients and providers regarding the improved safety and efficacy of newer IUDs will ensure an appropriate place in therapy. Thus, greater numbers of women will recognize the IUD as a safe, cost-effective means to contraception, thereby reducing the economic and social burdens associated with unplanned pregnancies.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Copper continuously released into the uterine cavity contributes to the contraceptive effectiveness of Paragard. Mechanism(s) by which copper enhances contraceptive efficacy include interference with sperm transport and fertilization of an egg, and possibly prevention of implantation.

### Evaluation and management of abnormal uterine bleeding...-AAFP (...) [^d9ae262c]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

The etiologies and treatments for abnormal uterine bleeding over the reproductive years are best understood in the context of normal menstrual physiology. A normal cycle starts when pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone induces ovarian follicles to produce estrogen. Estrogen stimulates proliferation of the endometrium. A luteinizing hormone surge prompts ovulation; the resultant corpus luteum produces progesterone, inducing a secretory endometrium. In the absence of pregnancy, estrogen and progesterone levels decline, and withdrawal bleeding occurs 13 to 15 days postovulation. 2 Disruption of normal physiology, anatomic changes in the endometrium, or endometrial cancer may result in abnormal uterine bleeding. Genital bleeding during childhood, uterine bleeding that requires emergent intervention, and postmenopausal uterine bleeding are also abnormal, but are beyond the scope of this article.

Anovulatory Bleeding At extremes of the reproductive years, irregular cycles resulting from anovulation can occur. Following menarche, the immature hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis may result in anovulatory cycles for two to three years. 2, 6 Up to eight years before menopause, women may again have intermittent anovulatory cycles. 2 During the rest of the reproductive years, however, recurrent irregular cycles may be caused by anovulation and are considered abnormal.
4. When ovulation does not occur, no corpus luteum forms to produce progesterone, leading to prolonged estrogenic stimulation of the endometrium, excessive proliferation, endometrial instability, and erratic bleeding. 4 Approximately 6 to 10 percent of women with anovulation have underlying polycystic ovary syndrome. 4 Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, 6 hypo- or hyperthyroidism, 8, 9 and hyperprolactinemia 4 also may cause anovulation by interfering with the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis.

6 Antiepileptics may cause weight gain, hyperandrogenism, and anovulation. 10 Use of typical antipsychotics and some atypical antipsychotics may contribute to anovulation by raising prolactin levels. 11.

5.6 Perforation

Partial or total perforation of the uterine wall or cervix may occur during insertions, although the perforation may not be detected until sometime later. Perforation may reduce contraceptive efficacy and result in pregnancy. The incidence of perforation during or following Paragard insertion in clinical trials was 0.2% (13 out of 5344).

Delayed detection or removal of Paragard in cases of perforation may result in migration outside the uterine cavity, adhesions, peritonitis, intestinal penetration, intestinal obstruction, abscesses and/or damage to adjacent organs.

A postmarketing safety study conducted in Europe (EURAS IUD) with IUSs, including copper IUSs, demonstrated an increased risk of perforation in lactating women. The risk of perforation may be increased if an IUS, such as Paragard, is inserted when the uterus is fixed, retroverted or not completely involuted during the postpartum period.

If perforation does occur, locate and remove Paragard promptly. Surgery may be required. Preoperative imaging followed by laparoscopy or laparotomy is often required to remove Paragard from the peritoneal cavity.

5.7 Expulsion

Partial or complete expulsion of Paragard has been reported, resulting in the loss of contraceptive protection. The incidence of expulsion in the clinical trials with Paragard was approximately 2.3%. Consider further diagnostic imaging, such as x-ray, to confirm expulsion if the IUS is not found in the uterus.

Paragard has been placed immediately after delivery, although the risk of expulsion may be increased when the uterus is not completely involuted at the time of insertion. Remove a partially expelled Paragard.

5.8 Wilson’s Disease

Paragard may exacerbate Wilson’s disease, a rare genetic disease affecting copper excretion; therefore, the use of Paragard is contraindicated in females of reproductive potential with Wilson’s disease [see Contraindications (4)] .

5.1 Ectopic Pregnancy

Evaluate for possible ectopic pregnancy in any female who becomes pregnant while using Paragard because a pregnancy that occurs with Paragard in place is more likely to be ectopic than a pregnancy in the general population. However, because Paragard prevents most pregnancies, females who use Paragard have a lower risk of an ectopic pregnancy than sexually active females who do not use any contraception.

The incidence of ectopic pregnancy in the clinical trials with Paragard (which excluded females with a previous history of ectopic pregnancy) was approximately 0.06%. Ectopic pregnancy may require surgery and may result in loss of fertility.

5.2 Risks with Intrauterine Pregnancy

If intrauterine pregnancy occurs with Paragard in place and the strings are visible or can be retrieved from the cervical canal, remove Paragard because leaving it in place may increase the risk of spontaneous abortion and preterm labor. Removal of Paragard may also result in spontaneous abortion. In the event of an intrauterine pregnancy with Paragard, consider the following:

Septic Abortion

In females becoming pregnant with an intrauterine system (IUS), including Paragard in place, septic abortion, with septicemia, septic shock, and death, may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Septic abortion typically requires hospitalization and treatment with intravenous antibiotics. Septic abortion may result in spontaneous abortion or a medical indication for pregnancy termination. A hysterectomy may be required if severe infection of the uterus occurs, which will result in permanent infertility.

Continuation of Pregnancy

If a female becomes pregnant with Paragard in place and if Paragard cannot be removed or the female chooses not to have it removed, warn her that failure to remove Paragard increases the risk of miscarriage, sepsis, premature labor, and premature delivery. Prenatal care should include counseling about these risks and that she should report immediately any flu-like symptoms, fever, chills, cramping, pain, bleeding, vaginal discharge or leakage of fluid, or any other symptom that suggests complications of the pregnancy.

Cu-IUD bleeding irregularities—counseling and evaluation: Before Cu-IUD placement, provide counseling about potential changes in bleeding patterns during Cu-IUD use, noting that spotting or light bleeding and heavy or prolonged bleeding is common during the first 3–6 months of Cu-IUD use, is generally not harmful but might be bothersome to the patient, and generally decreases with continued Cu-IUD use. If clinically indicated, consider an underlying health condition such as Cu-IUD displacement, STIs, pregnancy, thyroid disorders, or new pathologic uterine conditions (e.g., polyps or fibroids), especially in patients already using the Cu-IUD for a few months or longer who develop new heavy or prolonged bleeding; if an underlying condition is found, treat the condition or refer for care. Explore patient goals, including continued Cu-IUD use (with or without treatment for bleeding irregularities) or Cu-IUD removal.

### The potential bidirectional relationship between long COVID and menstruation [^ada7846e]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Intermenstrual bleeding or “spotting” (n = 12,187). As compared to the no COVID group, a history of COVID-19 increased the risk of more intermenstrual bleeding by 59% for long COVID (RRR = 1.59, 95% CI = [1.29 to 1.97], FDR p value < 0.001), but not for previous acute COVID (RRR = 1.15, 95% CI = [0.97 to 1.36], FDR p value = 0.22) (Fig. 1E). There was no association between a history of COVID-19 and less intermenstrual bleeding. Both more and less inter-menstrual bleeding increased with the use of hormonal contraceptives, the copper IUD, abnormal menstrual symptoms at baseline and presence of diagnosed reproductive pathology at baseline. (Table S5).

Missed episodes of menstruation (n = 12,187). As compared to the control group with no covid, the prevalence of reported “missed” and/or “stopped” periods increases by 39% in the long COVID group (PR = 1.39, 95% CI = [1.13 to 1.7], FDR p value = 0.003) but not in the previous acute COVID group (PR = 1.15, 95% CI = [0.97 to 1.37], FDR p value = 0.17, Table S6) (Fig. 1F). The probability of reporting missed or stopped periods decreases with age but increases with obesity, presence of diagnosed reproductive pathology at baseline and the use of exogenous hormones, especially progestin-based contraceptives.

In summary, reported menstrual flow volume, menstrual duration (>8 days), inter-menstrual bleeding and missed episodes of menstruation were significantly increased in those with long COVID versus no COVID. Menstrual frequency and regularity were unchanged. In contrast, in those with previous acute COVID, only menstrual volume was increased, but did not reach statistical significance.

A prospective study of long COVID symptoms revealed increased severity during the peri-menstrual and proliferative phases of the cycle

Bleeding Irregularities (Including Amenorrhea) with LNG-IUD Use

Before LNG-IUD placement, provide counseling about potential changes in bleeding patterns during LNG-IUD use. Spotting or light bleeding is expected during the first 3–6 months of LNG-IUD use and is generally not harmful but might be bothersome to the patient. Over time, bleeding generally decreases with LNG-IUD use, and many LNG-IUD users experience only light menstrual bleeding or amenorrhea. Heavy or prolonged bleeding is uncommon during LNG-IUD use.

Bleeding Irregularities (Spotting, Light Bleeding, or Heavy or Prolonged Bleeding)

If clinically indicated, consider an underlying health condition, such as LNG-IUD displacement, STIs, pregnancy, thyroid disorders, or new pathologic uterine conditions (e.g. polyps or fibroids). If an underlying health condition is found, treat the condition or refer for care.
Explore patient goals, including continued LNG-IUD use or LNG-IUD removal. If the patient wants to continue LNG-IUD use, provide reassurance and advise the patient that they may contact their provider at any time to discuss bleeding irregularities or other side effects.
If the patient desires LNG-IUD removal at any time, remove the LNG-IUD, offer counseling on alternative contraceptive methods, and initiate another method if it is desired.

### Treatment patterns in patients with uterine fibroids with and without a diagnosis of heavy menstrual bleeding: results from a large U.S. claims database [^f8be52eb]. Journal of Women's Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Outcomes and statistical analyses

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize study population characteristics. Treatment patterns over the first and second years following the index date, and for the full duration of postindex follow-up, were assessed as the proportion of patients treated with gynecologic procedures and/or prescribed pharmacologic therapies of interest that were reimbursed by insurance. Pharmacologic therapies of interest were hormonal treatments (oral and nonoral contraceptives), including intrauterine devices (IUDs, except ParaGard ® /copper IUD), estrogen, progestin, aromatase inhibitors, elagolix, danazol, leuprolide, or any luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists.

Also evaluated were the use of tranexamic acid and pain medicines, including narcotic (prescribed for ≥30 days) and prescription non-narcotic analgesics. Not available for analysis were over-the-counter products not captured in medical claims and prescriptions not reimbursed by the payer. Gynecologic procedures of interest were hysterectomy, operative laparoscopy, myomectomy, oophorectomy, ablation of the endometrium and/or fibroids, excision, and salpingectomy. Finally, data were collected for pharmacologic treatments of interest (hormonal or analgesic) received by patients in the year preceding the index date.

Patients in both cohorts who underwent hysterectomy within 1 year postindex date were further stratified by age. Logistic regression models were constructed to determine factors associated with specific treatments (hysterectomy and hormonal therapy) in patients with UF-HMB and UF-only. To isolate these findings to patients who received hysterectomy due to UF, the regression analysis excluded patients with a claim for endometriosis (ICD-9 617.X or ICD-10 N80.X). This exclusion was applied because of the potential for confounding due to concomitant comorbidity. The variables included in the logistic regression were factors that could contribute to treatment decision-making and that could be captured in claims data. These were age, abnormal bleeding, anemia, fatigue, infertility, pain, prior- and post-UF diagnosis use of medications, including hormonal treatment, non-narcotic, or narcotic analgesic treatment, and inpatient or outpatient diagnosis site. Data were analyzed using SAS/STAT(r) software, version 15.1 (2016 SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC, USA).

If you have breast cancer now, or have had it in the past, do not use hormonal birth control because some breast cancers are sensitive to hormones.

Women who use birth control pills may have a slightly higher chance of getting cervical cancer. However, this may be due to other reasons such as having more sexual partners.

What Should I Know about My Period when Taking OCELLA?

Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting may occur while you are taking OCELLA. Irregular bleeding may vary from slight staining between menstrual periods to breakthrough bleeding, which is a flow much like a regular period. Irregular bleeding occurs most often during the first few months of oral contraceptive use, but may also occur after you have been taking the pill for some time. Such bleeding may be temporary and usually does not indicate any serious problems. It is important to continue taking your pills on schedule. If the bleeding occurs in more than one cycle, is unusually heavy, or lasts for more than a few days, call your healthcare provider.

Some women may not have a menstrual period but this should not be cause for alarm as long has you have taken the pills regularly on time.

What if I Miss My Scheduled Period when Taking OCELLA?

It is not uncommon to miss your period. However, if you miss two periods in a row or miss one period when you have not taken your birth control pills regularly on time, call your healthcare provider. Also notify your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of pregnancy such as morning sickness or unusual breast tenderness. It is important that your healthcare provider checks you to find out if you are pregnant. Stop taking OCELLA if you are pregnant.

Women who use hormonal contraceptives may have a higher chance of getting cervical cancer. However, this may be due to other reasons such as having more sexual partners and exposure to the human papilloma virus (HPV).

What if I want to become pregnant?

You may stop taking SLYND whenever you wish. Consider a visit with your healthcare provider for a pre-pregnancy checkup before you stop taking SLYND.

What should I know about my period when taking SLYND?

Some females may miss a period. Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting may happen while you are taking SLYND, especially during the first few months of use. If the irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting continues or happens again after you have had regular menstrual cycles call your healthcare provider. It is important to continue taking your pills on a regular schedule to prevent a pregnancy.

What if I miss my scheduled period when using SLYND?

Some females miss periods on hormonal birth control, even when they are not pregnant. However, if you go 2 or more months in a row without a period, or you miss your period after a month where you did not use all of your SLYND correctly, call you healthcare provider because you may be pregnant. Also call your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of pregnancy such as morning sickness or unusual breast tenderness. Stop taking SLYND if you are pregnant.

If the patient desires LNG-IUD removal, remove the LNG-IUD, offer counseling on alternative contraceptive methods, and initiate another method if it is desired.

Comments and Evidence Summary. During contraceptive counseling and before placement of the LNG-IUD, information about common side effects such as spotting or light bleeding, especially during the first 3–6 months of use, should be discussed. Approximately half of LNG-IUD users are likely to experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea by 2 years of use. These bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful but might be bothersome to the patient. Enhanced counseling about expected bleeding patterns and reassurance that bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful has been reported to reduce method discontinuation in clinical trials with other hormonal contraceptives (i.e. DMPA).

A systematic review summarized the current body of evidence for treating bleeding irregularities with 52 mg LNG-IUD use (Supplementary Appendix,). RCTs of tranexamic acid, mefenamic acid, and UPA for the treatment of bleeding irregularities with 52 mg LNG-IUDs observed no differences between the treatment and placebo groups in bleeding or spotting over 90 days. A prospective cohort study examining oral estradiol demonstrated a significant reduction in bleeding days after 3 months of treatment compared with baseline; however, 68% of patients experienced side effects (e.g. painful or swollen breasts, headache, weight gain, and vaginal complaints) (Certainty of evidence: moderate to high for RCTs and very low for the observational study).

### Demographic, reproductive, and medical risk factors for intrauterine device expulsion [^04f4a347]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Our finding that diagnosed heavy menstrual bleeding is a risk factor for IUD expulsion is consistent with other APEX-IUD analyses and with other studies. One of the LNG-IUD types has an indication for treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding, and the majority of individuals with a recent or past diagnosis of heavy menstrual bleeding, or both, were LNG-IUD users in our study. An increased risk of expulsion in individuals with a history of heavy menstrual bleeding was also observed in the (much smaller) copper IUD cohort. Individuals with increased BMI are at higher risk for irregular periods and heavy menstrual bleeding,but we saw only modest attenuation of the HRs for BMI or heavy menstrual bleeding when adjusting for other risk factors and potential confounders.

Body mass index also emerged as an important risk factor for IUD expulsion, and the relationship of increasing rate of IUD expulsion with higher BMI (higher than 25) is consistent with the literature (Saito-Tom L et al. Obstet Gynecol 2017;129:66S–7S. doi: 10.1097/01.AOG.0000514850.20849.1f; Keder L, Darney P, Blumenthal P, Perriera L, Stuart G, Creinin M. Assessment of expulsions in nulliparous and multiparous women during the first year of use of Liletta, a new 52 mg levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system [abstract]. Contraception 2015;92:361. doi:). Increased inflammation associated with greater adiposity has been proposed as a mechanism for higher expulsion risk (Saito-Tom L et al. Obstet Gynecol 2017;129:66S–7S. doi: 10.1097/01.AOG.0000514850.20849.1f). Also, it is possibly more challenging to place the IUD at the fundus due to body habitus in individuals with obesity, which could lead to a higher risk of expulsion. We adjusted for difficult insertion; however, our variable may not have been adequately sensitive to capture nuanced difficulties with insertion.

Do birth control pills cause cancer?

It is not known if hormonal birth control pills cause breast cancer. Some studies, but not all, suggest that there could be a slight increase in the risk of breast cancer among current users with longer duration of use.

If you have breast cancer now, or have had it in the past, do not use hormonal birth control because some breast cancers are sensitive to hormones.

Women who use birth control pills may have a slightly higher chance of getting cervical cancer. However, this may be due to other reasons such as having more sexual partners.

What if I want to become pregnant?

You may stop taking the pill whenever you wish. Consider a visit with your healthcare provider for a pre-pregnancy checkup before you stop taking the pill.

What should I know about my period when taking Joyeaux?

Some women may miss a period. Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting may happen while you are taking Joyeaux, especially during the first few months of use. This usually is not a serious problem. If the irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting continues or happens again after you have had regular menstrual cycles call your healthcare provider. It is important to continue taking your pills on a regular schedule to prevent a pregnancy.

Cu-IUD—bleeding irregularities management and evidence: During contraceptive counseling and before placement of the Cu-IUD, common side effects including spotting or light bleeding or heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding, especially during the first 3–6 months of use, should be discussed. If the patient wants treatment during days of bleeding, NSAIDs for short-term treatment, 5–7 days, may be considered. Evidence includes a systematic review that identified 11 studies among Cu-IUD users, with Nine studies examining oral NSAIDs; however, only one NSAID study demonstrated statistically significant or notable reductions in mean total menstrual blood loss. One study among 19 Cu-IUD users with heavy bleeding suggested that oral tranexamic acid can significantly reduce mean blood loss during treatment compared with placebo, but an FDA warning states that tranexamic acid is contraindicated in women with active thromboembolic disease or with a history or intrinsic risk for thrombosis or thromboembolism. Treatment with aspirin demonstrated no statistically significant change in mean blood loss for pretreatment menstrual blood loss ≥80 mL or 60–80 mL and resulted in a significant increase when pretreatment menstrual blood loss was <60 mL. A trial of intranasal desmopressin (300 μg/day) for the first 5 days of menses for three treatment cycles found a significant reduction in mean blood loss compared with baseline, while one small study of three separate NSAIDs did not observe improvements in spotting in any group.

Menstrual parameters

We operationalized our outcome variables to approximate the FIGO classification system for normal and abnormal uterine bleeding in relation to five parameters: frequency, regularity, duration, volume, and inter-menstrual bleeding (FIGO System 1).

Frequency

In the latter part of the survey, participants were asked, “Over the last year, how many days long, on average, was your cycle (between the start of one bleed and the start of the next bleed)?”. Based on the number of days reported, we created a variable with 3 possible outcomes (Normal [24–38 days], Frequent [<24 days], Infrequent [>38 days], based on FIGO definitions).

Participants were also asked “Over the last year, have your periods stopped?” and “Over the last year, did you miss your periods at least once?” Although “stop” and “miss” were not defined, concerns over “missing periods” were being reported on social media and thus this variable was meant to capture people’s perception of their cycles from which we created a binary variable (perception of ‘missing’ or ‘stopped’ periods (0/1)).

Regularity

Participants were asked, “Over the last year, how irregular were the length of your menstrual cycles on average?”. We created a variable with 3 possible outcomes (Normal[<2 days; 2–5 days; 5–10 days], Somewhat irregular [10–20 days], Very irregular [>20 days]).

Duration

Participants were asked, “Over the last year, have you noticed any changes in the length of your menstrual cycle? Days of bleeding (Period length)” We created a binary variable with two possible outcomes (Normal ≤8 days; Prolonged >8 + days]).

Volume

“Over the last year, have you noticed any changes in your periods?” There were four possible outcomes (“Heavier”, “Lighter”, “No Changes” and “Heavier and Lighter”).

Intermenstrual bleeding

Over the last year, have you noticed any changes in spotting mid-cycle? There were four possible outcomes (“No changes”, “More”, “Sometimes”, “Sometimes less and sometimes more”.

Breakthrough bleeding, spotting, and amenorrhea are frequent reasons for patients discontinuing oral contraceptives. In breakthrough bleeding, as in all cases of irregular bleeding from the vagina, nonfunctional causes should be borne in mind. In undiagnosed persistent or recurrent abnormal bleeding from the vagina, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated to rule out pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another formulation may solve the problem. Changing to an oral contraceptive with a higher estrogen content, while potentially useful in minimizing menstrual irregularity, should be done only if necessary since this may increase the risk of thromboembolic disease.

Use of oral contraceptives in the event of a missed menstrual period:

If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period and oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed.
If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out.

How will Depo-Provera CI change my periods?

Change in normal menstrual cycle . The side effect reported most frequently by women who use Depo-Provera CI for birth controls is a change in their normal menstrual cycle. During the first year of using Depo-Provera CI, you might have one or more of the following changes:
irregular or unpredictable bleeding or spotting
an increase or decrease in menstrual bleeding
no bleeding at all . In clinical studies of Depo-Provera CI, 55% of women reported no menstrual bleeding (amenorrhea) after one year of use and 68% of women reported no menstrual bleeding after two years of use.
Missed period . During the time you are using Depo-Provera CI for birth controls, you may skip a period, or your periods may stop completely. If you have been receiving your shot of Depo-Provera CI regularly every 3 months, then you are probably not pregnant. However, if you think that you may be pregnant, see your healthcare professional.

Unusually heavy or continuous bleeding is not a usual effect of Depo-Provera CI and if this happens you should see your healthcare professional right away.

With continued use of Depo-Provera CI, bleeding usually decreases and many women stop having periods completely. When you stop using Depo-Provera CI your menstrual period will usually, in time, return to its normal cycle.

Counsel women who receive Paragard to notify a healthcare provider if they have complaints of lower abdominal or pelvic pain, odorous discharge, unexplained bleeding, fever, or genital lesions or sores. In such circumstances, perform a pelvic examination promptly to evaluate for possible pelvic infection. Remove Paragard in cases of recurrent PID or endometritis, or if an acute pelvic infection is severe or does not respond to treatment. PID or endometritis are often associated with a sexually transmitted infection and Paragard does not protect against STIs. The risk of PID or endometritis is greater for females who have multiple sexual partners, and also for females whose sexual partner have multiple sexual partners. Females who have had PID or endometritis are at increased risk for a recurrence or re-infection.

In particular, ascertain whether a female is at increased risk of infection, intravenous drug abuse). Paragard can alter the bleeding pattern and result in heavier and longer menstrual cycles with intermenstrual spotting. In two clinical trials with Paragard, there were reports of oligomenorrhea and amenorrhea; however, a causal relationship between Paragard and these events could not be established. Menstrual changes were the most common medical reason for discontinuation of Paragard. Discontinuation rates for pain and bleeding combined were highest in the first year of use and diminished thereafter. The percentage of females who discontinued Paragard because of bleeding problems or pain during these studies ranged from 12% in the first year to 2% in Year 9. Females complaining of heavy vaginal bleeding should be evaluated and treated, and may need to discontinue Paragard.

The pregnancy rate in the two clinical studies with Paragard was less than 1 pregnancy per 100 women each year. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease: Advise patients that pelvic inflammatory disease may occur after insertion of Paragard and that PID can cause tubal damage leading to ectopic pregnancy or infertility, or can necessitate hysterectomy, or cause death. Advise patients to recognize and report promptly any symptoms of PID including development of menstrual disorders, unusual vaginal discharge, abdominal or pelvic pain or tenderness, dyspareunia, chills, and fever.

Amenorrhea

Amenorrhea does not require any medical treatment. Provide reassurance. º If a patient’s regular bleeding pattern changes abruptly to amenorrhea, consider ruling out pregnancy if clinically indicated.
If the patient wants to discontinue DMPA, offer counseling on alternative contraceptive methods, and initiate another method if it is desired.

Comments and Evidence Summary. During contraceptive counseling and before initiation of DMPA, information about common side effects such as irregular bleeding should be discussed. Bleeding or spotting is common with DMPA use. In addition, amenorrhea is common after ≥1 years of continuous use. These bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful but might be bothersome to the patient. Enhanced counseling among DMPA users detailing expected bleeding patterns and reassurance that these irregularities generally are not harmful has been demonstrated to reduce DMPA discontinuation in clinical trials.

Evidence is limited on specific drugs, doses, and durations of use for effective treatments for bleeding irregularities with DMPA use. Therefore, this report includes general recommendations for treatments to consider rather than specific regimens.

A systematic review, as well as two additional studies, examined the treatment of bleeding irregularities during DMPA use (–). Two small studies found significant cessation of bleeding within 7 days of starting treatment among women taking valdecoxib for 5 days or mefenamic acid for 5 days compared with placebo. Treatment with EE was found to stop bleeding better than placebo during the treatment period, although rates of discontinuation were high and safety outcomes were not examined. In one small study among DMPA users who had been experiencing amenorrhea for 2 months, treatment with COCs was found to alleviate amenorrhea better than placebo. No studies examined the effects of aspirin on bleeding irregularities among DMPA users.

5.8	Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea

Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting

Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different contraceptive product.

In clinical trials of MonoNessa and TriNessa, the frequency and duration of breakthrough bleeding and/or spotting was assessed in 1,647 patients (21,275 evaluable cycles) and 4,826 patients (35,546 evaluable cycles), respectively. A total of 100 (7.5%) women discontinued MonoNessa and 231 (4.8%) women discontinued TriNessa, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Based on data from the clinical trials, 14–34% of women using MonoNessa experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle in the first year; for TriNessa, the respective numbers were 13–38%. The percent of women who experienced breakthrough/unscheduled bleeding tended to decrease over time.

Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea

Women who use MonoNessa or TriNessa may experience amenorrhea. Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.

If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.

5.9	COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy

Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue MonoNessa or TriNessa use if pregnancy is confirmed.

Administration of COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] .

### Genetic and epigenetic characteristics in ovarian tissues from polycystic ovary syndrome patients with irregular menstruation resemble those of ovarian cancer [^eecbc778]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Ovarian cancer is associated with high morbidity and low 5-year survival rates. The trend for poor outcomes in ovarian cancer is due in part to the fact that 60% of patients first present with the disease once it has reached an advanced distant stage, at which the 5-year survival rate is 29%, highlighting the importance of understanding risk factors to facilitate early detection and intervention. The carcinogenesis of ovarian cancer is hormonally driven. Notably, an increased number of ovulatory cycles confers an elevated risk for ovarian cancer ; however, a relationship between irregularly long menstrual periods (low number of cycles) and an increased risk of ovarian cancer incidence and mortality has also been described.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a collection of symptoms arising from an excess of androgens. Menstrual cycle-specific symptoms of PCOS include amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, or menorrhagia, with the most common feature being irregularly long menstrual periods. The link between PCOS, menstrual period length, and ovarian cancer remains unclear; several studies have provided evidence both supporting and refuting an association, but few large population studies have investigated this relationship.

The association between ovarian cancer and PCOS remains controversial with various studies yielding mixed results and lacking statistical power. A 2016 review found studies on the relationship between PCOS and ovarian cancer with risk ratios ranging from 1.0–2.4, none of which were statistically significant. A 1996 study reported a positive relationship between PCOS and epithelial ovarian cancer (odds ratio [OR] 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1–5.9). Interestingly, that study also found that never having used oral contraceptives (OR 10.5; 95% CI 2.5–44.2) and a low body mass index at age 18 years (OR 15.6; 95% CI 3.4–71.0) strengthened the association between PCOS and ovarian cancer. A 2014 meta-analysis found no association between PCOS and ovarian cancer (OR 1.41; 95% CI 0.93–2.1), but detected a positive association between PCOS and ovarian cancer in women < 54 years (OR 2.52; 95% CI 1.08–5.89). Current literature gives no clear consensus on the association between these two conditions, and suggests that the relationship is multifactorial and stratified among different subtypes of ovarian cancer. These findings highlight the importance of continued investigation into the relationship between ovarian cancer and PCOS.

5.10 Bleeding Irregularities

Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC.

Data from ten contraceptive efficacy clinical trials (N=2,467) show that the percent of women who took OCELLA and experienced unscheduled bleeding decreased over time from 12% at cycle 2 to 6% (cycle 13). A total of 24 subjects out of 2,837 in the OCELLA trials (<1%) discontinued due to bleeding complaints. These are described as metrorrhagia, vaginal hemorrhage, menorrhagia, abnormal withdrawal bleeding, and menometrorrhagia.

The average duration of scheduled bleeding episodes in the majority of subjects (86%-88%) was 4-7 days. Women who use OCELLA may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. Based on subject diaries from contraceptive efficacy trials, during cycles 2–13, 1-11% of women per cycle experienced no withdrawal bleeding. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.

If withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.

5.11 Depression

Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and OCELLA discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree .

5.12 Interference with Laboratory Tests

The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs [see Drug Interactions (7.2)] .

DRSP causes an increase in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone induced by its mild anti-mineralocorticoid activity.

### Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol (Daysee) [^f2170d35]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.9 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea

Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting

Women using Daysee may experience unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting, especially during the first 3 months of use. Bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or by changing to a different contraceptive product. If unscheduled bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, evaluate for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy.

When prescribing Daysee, the occurrence of fewer planned menses (4 per year instead of 13 per year) should be weighed against the occurrence of increased unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting. The primary clinical trial (PSE-301) that evaluated the efficacy of Daysee also assessed unscheduled bleeding. The participants in the 12-month clinical trial (N=1,006) completed the equivalent of 8,681 28-day cycles of exposure and were composed primarily of women who had used oral contraceptives previously (89%) as opposed to new users (11%). A total of 82 (8.2%) of the women discontinued Daysee, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting.

Scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding and/or spotting remained fairly constant over time, with an average of 3 days of bleeding and/or spotting per each 91-day cycle. Unscheduled bleeding and unscheduled spotting decreased over successive 91-day cycles. Table 1 below presents the number of days with unscheduled bleeding in treatment cycles 1 and 4. Table 2 presents the number of days with unscheduled spotting in treatment cycles 1 and 4.

Figure 2 shows the percentage of Daysee subjects participating in trial PSE-301 with ≥ 7 days or ≥ 20 days of unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting, or only unscheduled bleeding, during each 91-day treatment cycle.

Figure 2: Percent of Women Taking Daysee who Reported Unscheduled Bleeding and/or Spotting or only Unscheduled Bleeding

If unscheduled spotting or bleeding occurs, instruct the patient to continue on the same regimen. If the bleeding is persistent or prolonged, advise the patient to consult her healthcare provider.

Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea

Women who use Daysee may experience absence of scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding, even if they are not pregnant.

If scheduled bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy.

After discontinuation of Daysee, amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea may occur, especially if these conditions were pre-existent.

### Development, updates, and future directions of the World Health Organization selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use [^7631cec4]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2017). Low credibility.

4. | RESEARCH GAPS

The goal of WHO and its partners is to use the best available evidence to develop SPR guidance; however, many recommendations are based on limited or indirect evidence. For example, limited information exists on optimal follow-up schedules after contraceptive method initiation, and further investigations on the impact of follow-up on contraceptive continuation can refine existing recommendations. Additionally, certain recommendations are based on indirect evidence from similar contraceptive methods in the absence of direct evidence. As an example, recommendations on when to start the combined contraceptive patch and contraceptive vaginal ring are derived from indirect data from the combined oral contraceptive pill in view of the similarities in the type and dose of hormone used in combined hormonal contraceptive methods. Although these recommendations are likely to be scientifically valid, evidence review highlights the relative lack of available data for newer contraceptive methods.

Knowledge gaps for future research in contraceptive management are identified with every update of the SPR.,, Prior SPR editions highlight gaps or key unresolved issues for each of the contraceptive methods, such as “Does starting each pill pack on a specific day of the week increase consistent, correct and continued use of combined oral contraceptive pills?”, “How quickly is protection reliably established by injections of DMPA [depot medroxyprogester-one acetate] and NET-EN [norethisterone enantate]?”, and “What are the mechanisms underlying progestogen-only injectable-associated bleeding abnormalities and how can they best be treated?”. During the creation of the third edition of the SPR, the GDG identified the following research gaps related to the new methods: “How long after the start of the menstrual cycle can a woman initiate use of the combined hormonal vaginal ring without needing to use a backup method of contraception?”, “Does the timing of return to fertility after a DMPA subcutaneous injection differ compared with the timing following a DMPA intramuscular injection?”, and “Can Sino-implant (II) be used as an effective method of contraception for more than 4 years?”.Another research gap is when to start regular hormonal contraception after using ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception. New evidence suggests that taking ulipristal acetate and progestin-containing contraception in close succession could impact effectiveness of both UPA and the regular contraceptive in terms of pregnancy prevention.Recognition of such research gaps during the SPR revision process can serve as a framework to direct future high-quality studies that will further inform recommendations, better meet providers’ needs, and improve quality of family planning services.

### Practice bulletin summary no. 152: emergency contraception [^4bae6c22]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Medium credibility.

Emergency contraception—additional clinical considerations: To maximize effectiveness, women should be educated about the availability of emergency contraception in advance of need. Information regarding effective long-term contraceptive methods should be made available whenever a woman requests emergency contraception. Oral emergency contraception may be used more than once, even within the same menstrual cycle. Clinical evaluation is indicated for women who have used emergency contraception if menses are delayed by a week or more after the expected time or if lower abdominal pain or persistent irregular bleeding develops. The copper IUD is appropriate for use as emergency contraception in women who meet standard criteria for an IUD and who desire long-acting contraception.

If you have breast cancer now, or have had it in the past, do not use hormonal birth control because some breast cancers are sensitive to hormones.

Women who use birth control pills may have a slightly higher chance of getting cervical cancer. However, this may be due to other reasons such as having more sexual partners.

What Should I Know about My Period when Taking Safyral?

Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting may occur while you are taking Safyral. Irregular bleeding may vary from slight staining between menstrual periods to breakthrough bleeding, which is a flow much like a regular period. Irregular bleeding occurs most often during the first few months of oral contraceptive use, but may also occur after you have been taking the pill for some time. Such bleeding may be temporary and usually does not indicate any serious problems. It is important to continue taking your pills on schedule. If the bleeding occurs in more than one cycle, is unusually heavy, or lasts for more than a few days, call your healthcare provider.

Some women may not have a menstrual period but this should not be cause for alarm as long as you have taken the pills regularly on time.

What if I Miss My Scheduled Period when Taking Safyral?

It is not uncommon to miss your period. However, if you miss two periods in a row or miss one period when you have not taken your birth control pills regularly on time, call your healthcare provider. Also notify your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of pregnancy such as morning sickness or unusual breast tenderness. It is important that your healthcare provider checks you to find out if you are pregnant. Stop taking Safyral if you are pregnant.

### Cyclic perimenstrual pain and discomfort and Australian women's associated use of complementary and alternative medicine: a longitudinal study [^ded76c58]. Journal of Women's Health (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the longitudinal change in Australian women's prevalence of cyclic perimenstrual pain and discomfort and the association between their symptoms and use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM).

Method

Data on endometriosis, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), irregular periods, heavy periods, and severe period pain were collected over a 7-year period from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health, for women aged 28 to 33 years in 2006, and at 3-year follow-ups. Changes in symptoms and patterns of CAM practitioner and therapy/product use associated with these symptoms were analyzed using longitudinal regression modeling.

Results

Over the 7-year period, prevalence rates of PMS and heavy periods increased, while prevalence rates of endometriosis, irregular periods, and severe period pain remained stable. The most common use of CAM longitudinally associated with the perimenstrual symptoms was use of vitamins/minerals, yoga/meditation, massage therapy, herbal medicine, and aromatherapy. Excluding consultation with a naturopath/herbalist, over the 7-year survey women's use of all other CAM practitioners increased as did their use of vitamin/minerals, yoga/meditation, and Chinese medicines, while aromatherapy use declined.

Conclusion

Only the prevalence of PMS and heavy periods increased with aging in this sample of women. While overall use of CAM practitioner and self-prescribed products/therapies increased over time, CAM was chosen by women mainly to treat endometriosis and PMS. The extent to which this use reflects treatment efficacy is uncertain.

5.8 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea

Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting

Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different contraceptive product.

In the clinical trial of Tri-Lo-Marzia, the frequency and duration of unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting was assessed in 1,673 women (11,015 evaluable cycles). A total of 3 (0.2%) women discontinued Tri-Lo-Marzia, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Based on data from the clinical trials, 7 to 17% of women using Tri-Lo-Marzia experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle in the first year. The percent of women who experienced unscheduled bleeding tended to decrease over time.

Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea

Women who use Tri-Lo-Marzia may experience amenorrhea. Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.

If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.

5.9 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy

Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue Tri-Lo-Marzia use if pregnancy is confirmed.

Administration of COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1)].

### Will the pill make me sterile? Addressing reproductive health concerns and strategies to improve adherence to hormonal contraceptive regimens in adolescent girls [^34fcaf21]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

PAPER OBJECTIVE: This paper is designed to help clinicians understand the relationship between hormonal contraceptive side effects and the potential development of general and reproductive health concerns that can impact on adherence to hormonal contraception. By understanding the concerns raised by young women, we can then make our counseling more specific to the factors that affect compliance in this population.

Design

Studies that specifically addressed hormonal contraceptive compliance, side effects, and method selection in adolescents and young women were chosen for this paper. All articles were from peer-reviewed journals. Medline-Ovid articles from 1980-2000 were used with the following search keywords: Contraception, Patient Compliance, Hormonal Contraception, Oral Contraceptive Pills, Norplant, Depo Provera, and Adolescents.

Data Synthesis

The general public has many concerns about the safety of hormonal contraception. The development of side effects, especially those that are menstrual-related, seem to cause adolescents and young women to feel that their general and reproductive health is being threatened.

Conclusions

Hormonal contraceptive counseling should include 1) explaining, in a nontechnical manner, how these methods work; 2) addressing negative information the patient has heard about the methods; 3) providing factual information about cancer risks, blood clots, and other general health concerns; 4) discussing the potential side effects and what each means to her health; 5) asking specifically about possible reproductive health worries, especially in light of the menstrual irregularities that may occur; and 6) assuring the patient that she should always feel free to share her concerns and worries with you, the provider.

### How regular is regular? An analysis of menstrual cycle regularity [^5fd2a1aa]. Contraception (2004). Low credibility.

We performed a retrospective analysis to ascertain how accurately women who believe that they have regular menstrual cycles estimate the length of their actual cycles. Data were extracted from a chart review of subjects from three different studies of barrier contraceptives. Subjects were between 18 and 40 years of age and reported "regular" prestudy menstrual cycles with a consistent cycle length between 21 and 35 days. Participants prospectively recorded their menses for the up to 30 weeks. Each subject's estimated cycle length was compared to the average of her actual cycle lengths and the range and variability in each individual's cycle length was calculated. A total of 786 cycles from 130 women who recorded 4 or more cycles were analyzed. The averages of the participants' estimated cycle lengths was similar to the prospective averages of their actual cycle lengths (29.0 +/- 2.7 days vs. 29.1 +/- 3.5 days, respectively, p = 0.8). Forty-six percent of all subjects had a cycle range of 7 days or more, and 20% had a cycle range of 14 days or more. The average length of menses was 5.2 +/- 1.0 days. When evaluating only women with cycle lengths from 21 to 35 days, the average length of menses was positively associated with the average actual cycle length (p = 0.04). Although the average of a woman's menstrual cycles compares favorably to her impression of her cycle length, the variability in menstrual cycle lengths is significant. This variation may have clinical impact on contraceptive practice, contraceptive research studies and pregnancy-related care.

5.10 Bleeding Irregularities

Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC.

Data from ten contraceptive efficacy clinical trials (N=2,467) show that the percent of women who took Yasmin and experienced unscheduled bleeding decreased over time from 12% at cycle 2 to 6% (cycle 13). A total of 24 subjects out of 2,837 in the Yasmin trials (<1%) discontinued due to bleeding complaints. These are described as metrorrhagia, vaginal hemorrhage, menorrhagia, abnormal withdrawal bleeding, and menometrorrhagia.

The average duration of scheduled bleeding episodes in the majority of subjects (86%-88%) was 4-7 days. Women who use Yasmin may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. Based on subject diaries from contraceptive efficacy trials, during cycles 2–13, 1-11% of women per cycle experienced no withdrawal bleeding. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.

If withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.

5.11 Depression

Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and Yasmin discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree .

5.12 Interference with Laboratory Tests

The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs [see Drug Interactions (7.2)] .

Copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD) bleeding irregularities—counseling and management include that during contraceptive counseling and before placement of the Cu-IUD, information about common side effects such as spotting or light bleeding or heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding, especially during the first 3–6 months of use, should be discussed; if the patient desires Cu-IUD removal at any time, remove the Cu-IUD, offer counseling on alternative contraceptive methods, and initiate another method if it is desired; and if the patient wants treatment, the following treatment option may be considered during days of bleeding, depending on the patient’s preferences, treatment goals, and medical history: NSAIDs for short-term treatment, 5–7 days. Evidence summarized on-page states that a systematic review identified 11 studies, that all but one NSAID study demonstrated statistically significant or notable reductions in mean total menstrual blood loss with NSAID use, and that one study among 19 Cu-IUD users with heavy bleeding suggested oral tranexamic acid can significantly reduce mean blood loss but a FDA warning states that tranexamic acid is contraindicated in women with active thromboembolic disease or with a history or intrinsic risk for thrombosis or thromboembolism; treatment with aspirin showed no statistically significant change in mean blood loss among women whose pretreatment menstrual blood loss was >80 mL or 60–80 mL and a significant increase when pretreatment menstrual blood loss was <60 mL; one study of intranasal desmopressin (300 μg/day) for the first 5 days of menses for three treatment cycles found a significant reduction in mean blood loss compared with baseline; and one small study did not observe improvements in spotting with three separate NSAIDs.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^b197d2c3]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA)—management of bleeding irregularities—emphasizes counseling and optional short‑term treatments. If the patient wants treatment, the following treatment options during days of bleeding may be considered, depending on the patient’s preferences, treatment goals, and medical history: NSAIDs: short‑term treatment, 5–7 days; for heavy or prolonged bleeding, hormonal treatment with low‑dose combined oral contraceptives (COCs) or estrogen for short‑term treatment, 10–20 days. Amenorrhea does not require any medical treatment and reassurance is advised; if a patient’s regular bleeding pattern changes abruptly to amenorrhea, consider ruling out pregnancy if clinically indicated. Bleeding or spotting is common with DMPA use, and amenorrhea is common after ≥1 years of continuous use. Enhanced counseling detailing expected bleeding patterns and reassurance that these irregularities generally are not harmful has been demonstrated to reduce DMPA discontinuation in clinical trials. Two small studies found significant cessation of bleeding within 7 days of starting treatment among DMPA users taking valdecoxib for 5 days or mefenamic acid for 5 days compared with placebo; treatment with EE was found to stop bleeding better than placebo during the treatment period; and in one small study among DMPA users with amenorrhea for 2 months, treatment with COCs alleviated amenorrhea better than placebo; no studies examined the effects of aspirin on bleeding irregularities among DMPA users. If the patient wants to discontinue DMPA at any time, offer counseling on alternative contraceptive methods and initiate another method if it is desired.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^cc38d8a5]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Comments and Evidence Summary. During contraceptive counseling and before placement of the Cu-IUD, information about common side effects such as spotting or light bleeding or heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding, especially during the first 3–6 months of use, should be discussed. These bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful but might be bothersome to the patient. Enhanced counseling about expected bleeding patterns and reassurance that bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful has been reported to reduce method discontinuation in clinical trials with other contraceptives (i.e. DMPA).

Evidence is limited on specific drugs, doses, and durations of use for effective treatments for bleeding irregularities with Cu-IUD use. Therefore, this report includes general recommendations for treatments to consider rather than specific regimens.

A systematic review identified 11 studies that examined various therapeutic treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding, prolonged menstrual bleeding, or both among women using Cu-IUDs. Nine studies examined the use of various oral NSAIDs for the treatment of heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding among Cu-IUD users and compared them with either a placebo or a baseline cycle. Three of these trials examined the use of indomethacin (–), three examined mefenamic acid (–), and three examined flufenamic acid. Other NSAIDs used in the reported trials included alclofenac, suprofen, and diclofenac sodium. All but one NSAID study demonstrated statistically significant or notable reductions in mean total menstrual blood loss with NSAID use. One study among 19 Cu-IUD users with heavy bleeding suggested that treatment with oral tranexamic acid can significantly reduce mean blood loss during treatment compared with placebo. Data regarding the overall safety of tranexamic acid are limited; an FDA warning states that tranexamic acid is contraindicated in women with active thromboembolic disease or with a history or intrinsic risk for thrombosis or thromboembolism. Treatment with aspirin demonstrated no statistically significant change in mean blood loss among women whose pretreatment menstrual blood loss was >80 mL or 60–80 mL; treatment resulted in a significant increase among women whose pretreatment menstrual blood loss was <60 mL. One study examined the use of a synthetic form of vasopressin, intranasal desmopressin (300 µ g/day) for the first 5 days of menses for three treatment cycles and found a significant reduction in mean blood loss compared with baseline (Level of evidence: I to II-3, poor to fair, direct). Only one small study examined treatment of spotting with three separate NSAIDs and did not observe improvements in spotting in any of the groups (Level of evidence: I, poor, direct).

### Measure do not guess: a call to action to end assumed and estimated menstrual cycle phases in research [^5f3ea879]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The problem

Sometimes, a parameter of interest (eg, ovulation) can be measured in various ways (eg, urinary luteinising hormone kits or transvaginal ultrasound), which are open to debate, but nevertheless, these are still measurements; nothing is guessed. When you assume something, you accept it is true or certain to happen without proof. When you estimate something, you take a guess (ie, a rough calculation based on something else). In both cases, you have not used a technique that allows you actually to measure the parameter of interest. You exploit the relationship between a somewhat associated variable (ie, regular menstruation) and a parameter (ie, the remaining phases of the menstrual cycle). As such, it is assumed that an event has occurred (eg, ovulation), and then the timing of that event is estimated (eg, it occurs at the halfway point of the cycle). Assumptions and estimations are made regardless of what is happening (eg, assuming ovulation has definitely occurred when, in reality, it may not have). These assumptions and estimates are not always harmless; many ovarian hormone profiles exist, and regular menstruation does not preclude menstrual dysfunctions, which go undetected with assumed and estimated phases. When adopting an assumed or estimated approach transparent reporting, including the quantification of confidence in these assumptions and estimations, is of utmost importance. While some limitations are often described, and rarely—if ever—are all of the implications of these assumptions and estimations clearly explained to the reader or user. Studies using an assumed and estimated menstrual cycle phase approach frequently do us a disservice; for example, they use the same terminology when assuming or estimating as other authors use when measuring (eg, using specific phase names associated with measurements—such as ‘early luteal’—when they have not measured but assumed that phase and should in fact use the broader term ‘non-bleeding day’). When the prevailing narrative is that female populations have been underserved by research, accepting assumptions and estimates is not the progress it is purported to be.

### Menstrual irregularity from hormonal contraception: a cause of reproductive health concerns in minority adolescent young women [^b2ea9d96]. Contraception (2006). Low credibility.

Context

Adolescents are frequent users of hormonal contraception (HC), yet their adherence to these methods is often poor. Concerns about side effects, especially those affecting the menstrual system, are often given as reasons for contraceptive nonadherence or discontinuation. We sought to identify teens' concerns and misperceptions about the menstrual-related side effects of HC.

Methods

Open focus groups were conducted with both sexually active and virgin adolescent women aged 12-18 years who were recruited from the Philadelphia area. The adolescents did not have to be contraceptive users in order to participate. The question put to each group was, "What are the things you have heard about the birth control pill, Depo-Provera and Norplant?" Groups were audio-recorded, transcribed and analyzed using qualitative software.

Results

We conducted 13 female-only groups. Participants raised frequent concerns about menstrual-related side effects, believing that these side effects were evidence of possible negative effects of HC on their reproductive health. Four themes related to hormonal contraceptive-induced menstrual irregularity emerged from the groups. Theme 1: Menstruation is natural and should not be altered in any way. Theme 2: The menstrual period is necessary for cleansing of the body. Theme 3: "Spotting," intermenstrual bleeding and amenorrhea cause doubts about the method's effectiveness and worries about pregnancy. Theme 4: All menstrual irregularity, from intermenstrual bleeding to amenorrhea, causes worry about the effects on fertility and on physical health.

Conclusions

Teens have concerns about the menstrual irregularity caused by HC. Providers understand that these side effects are minor and of little medical consequence. Yet, adolescent patients may be ascribing great significance to these effects and may be declining these methods because of fear and misperceptions.

### Inherent spatiotemporal uncertainty of renewable power in China [^aef00b4b]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Key factors affecting prediction errors

Two statistical indicators are proposed to explore the factors impacting prediction errors. Due to the irregular distribution of the wind output and the daily periodicity of the solar output, we use hourly and daily output data to analyze the wind and solar prediction errors, respectively (Methods and Supplementary Fig. 4). We use the coefficient of determination (CoD), which measures the linear correlation, to quantify the relationship between the prediction error and various factors. The installed capacity is independent of the prediction error, withfor wind energy (Fig. 2a) andfor solar energy (Fig. 2b). In addition, the power generation reflected by the bubble size exhibited no correlation with the prediction error (Fig. 2a, b).

As shown in Fig. 2c, d, the results indicate that the first-order difference is a major influencing factor of the prediction error, which comprises a series of changes from one period to the next. The relationship between the prediction error and first-order difference is approximately linear. Regarding wind power, the relationship between the prediction error and hourly first-order difference yields(Fig. 2c), while the daily first-order difference does not impact the wind prediction error (please refer to the bubble size in Fig. 2c). Regarding solar power, the CoD between the prediction error and the daily first-order difference is(Fig. 2d). The hourly first-order difference, however, could not reflect the prediction error, as indicated by the bubble size in Fig. 2d. The reason is that wind power prediction is conducted hour-by-hour, and the daily wind power generation is irregular and cannot reflect the hourly wind generation pattern. Regarding solar power, power generation varies periodically daily, and the characteristics of the hourly first-order difference could be masked by this daily periodicity.

### Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol (balcoltra) [^90ca14a5]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

What if I want to become pregnant?

You may stop taking the pill whenever you wish. Consider a visit with your healthcare provider for a pre-pregnancy checkup before you stop taking the pill.

What should I know about my period when taking Balcoltra?

Some women may miss a period. Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting may happen while you are taking Balcoltra, especially during the first few months of use. This usually is not a serious problem. If the irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting continues or happens again after you have had regular menstrual cycles call your healthcare provider. It is important to continue taking your pills on a regular schedule to prevent a pregnancy.

What if I miss my scheduled period when using Balcoltra?

Some women miss periods on hormonal birth control, even when they are not pregnant. However, if you go 2 or more months in a row without a period, or you miss your period after a month where you did not use all of your Balcoltra correctly, call your healthcare provider because you may be pregnant. Also call your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of pregnancy such as morning sickness or unusual breast tenderness. Stop taking Balcoltra if you are pregnant.

What are the ingredients in Balcoltra?

Active ingredients: Orange tablets: levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol.

Inactive ingredients : Orange tablets: FD&C Yellow #5 Aluminum Lake, FD&C Yellow #6 Aluminum Lake, FD&C Red #40 Aluminum Lake, titanium dioxide, polyvinyl alcohol, talc, macrogol/polyethylene glycol 3350 NF, lecithin (soya), iron oxide black, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate and pregelatinized starch.

Postpartum (Including Cesarean Delivery, Breastfeeding, or Nonbreastfeeding)

Timing: The Cu-IUD may be placed at any time postpartum, including immediately postpartum (U.S. MEC 1 or 2), if it is reasonably certain that the patient is not pregnant (Box 3). Postpartum placement of IUDs is safe. Higher rates of expulsion during the postpartum period should be considered as they relate to effectiveness, along with patient access to interval placement (i.e. not related to pregnancy) when expulsion rates are lower. The Cu-IUD should not be placed in a patient with postpartum sepsis (e.g. chorioamnionitis or endometritis) (U.S. MEC 4).
Need for back-up contraception : No additional contraceptive protection is needed.

Postabortion (Spontaneous or Induced)

Timing: The Cu-IUD may be placed at any time postabortion, including immediately after abortion completion (U.S. MEC 1 or 2), if it is reasonably certain that the patient is not pregnant (Box 3). The Cu-IUD should not be placed immediately after a septic abortion (U.S. MEC 4).
Need for back-up contraception: No additional contraceptive protection is needed.

Switching from Another Contraceptive Method

Timing: The Cu-IUD may be placed immediately if it is reasonably certain that the patient is not pregnant (Box 3). Waiting for the patient’s next menstrual cycle is unnecessary.
Need for back-up contraception: No additional contraceptive protection is needed.

Comments and Evidence Summary. In situations in which the health care provider is not reasonably certain that the patient is not pregnant, the patient should be offered a contraceptive method other than an IUD to use until the health care provider can be reasonably certain that the patient is not pregnant and can place the Cu-IUD. (As appropriate, see recommendations for Emergency Contraception.)

A systematic review identified eight studies that suggested that timing of Cu-IUD placement in relation to the menstrual cycle in nonpostpartum women had little effect on long-term outcomes (i.e. rates of continuation, removal, expulsion, or pregnancy) or on short-term outcomes (i.e. pain at placement, bleeding at placement, or immediate expulsion) (Level of evidence: II-2, fair, direct).

### Contraception in perimenopause [^6043eee9]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

Perimenopause is characterized by wide hormone fluctuations and irregular menstrual cycles for 5 or more years preceding menopause and lasts until 12 months of amenorrhea have been achieved. It represents a period of reproductive transition with a decline in fertility. However, unintended pregnancies do occur, with a high risk for poor outcomes and maternal complications. All women transitioning through perimenopause should be adequately counseled. There are many hormone and nonhormone contraceptive methods that are highly effective and suited to the personal and medical needs of the perimenopausal woman. Contraception should continue until menopause is confirmed.

SIDE EFFECTS OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

In addition to the risks and more serious side effects discussed above (see RISKS OF TAKING ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES, ESTIMATED RISK OF DEATH FROM A BIRTH CONTROL METHOD OR PREGNANCY and WARNING SIGNALS sections), the following may also 
occur:

1.000000000000000e+00 Irregular vaginal bleeding

Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting (bleeding or spotting between your 
expected period) is likely to occur while you are taking Jolessa™. Irregular bleeding may vary from slight staining between 
menstrual periods to breakthrough bleeding which is a flow much like a regular 
period. Irregular bleeding occurs most often during the first few 91-day cycles 
of Jolessa™use, tends to decrease during later cycles, 
but may also occur after you have been taking Jolessa™for some time. Such bleeding usually does not indicate any serious problems. It is important to continue taking your pills on schedule even 
if you are having irregular bleeding . If the bleeding lasts for more than 
7 consecutive days, talk to your healthcare provider.

When you take Jolessa™, you need to consider the 
convenience of fewer expected menstrual periods (4 per year instead of 13) and 
the inconvenience of more irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting. In a clinical 
trial comparing Jolessa™(91-day cycles) to a 
conventional equivalent dosage 28-day cycle oral contraceptive, more women using 
Jolessa™discontinued treatment because of bleeding 
problems (7.7% of the Jolessa™users compared to 1.8% of 
the 28-day cycle users).

### ABM clinical protocol # 13: contraception during breastfeeding, revised 2015 [^52c4654a]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) criteria and counseling—LAM includes three criteria for defining the period of lowest pregnancy risk, and if one criterion is not met, women should immediately initiate another method. Clinically, mothers are asked: Are you amenorrheic, meaning that you have not had a menstrual bleed or any bleed of > 2 days in duration, discounting any bleed in the first 2 months; Are you fully or nearly fully breastfeeding; and Is your infant less than 6 months of age. If she answers yes to all three questions, she meets the requirements for LAM; if any answer is no, her chance of pregnancy is increased and she should be advised to initiate another form of contraception to prevent pregnancy. Definitions specify that full or nearly full breastfeeding includes exclusive, nearly exclusive, and some irregularly provided supplements as long as they do not disrupt the frequency of feeds, and that menses return is defined as any bleeding that occurs after 56 days postpartum that is perceived by the patient as a menses, or any two consecutive days of bleeding. Clinicians should ensure that she has chosen her next method of contraception and either has it on hand or knows how to obtain it if it is an implant or intrauterine device (IUD).

### Sleep irregularity is associated with hypertension: findings from over 2 million nights with a large global population sample [^d730aef6]. Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Irregularities in sleep duration and sleep timing have emerged as potential risk factors for hypertension. This study examined associations between irregularity in sleep duration and timing with hypertension in a large, global sample over multiple months.

Methods

Data from 12287 adults, who used an under-mattress device to monitor sleep duration and timing and also provided blood pressure recordings on ≥5 separate occasions, were analyzed. Sleep duration irregularity was assessed as the SD in total sleep time across the ≈9-month recording period. Sleep timing irregularity was assessed as SDs in sleep onset time, sleep midpoint, and sleep offset time. Logistic regressions were conducted to investigate associations between sleep irregularity and hypertension, defined as median systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg or median diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg.

Results

Participants were middle-aged (mean±SD, 50±12 years), mostly men (88%) and overweight (body mass index, 28±6 kg/m -2 ). Sleep duration irregularity was consistently associated with an ≈9% to 17% increase in hypertension independently of the total sleep time. A ≈34-minute increase in sleep onset time irregularity was associated with a 32% increase in hypertension (1.32 [1.20-1.45]). A 32-minute increase in sleep midpoint irregularity was associated with an 18% increase in hypertension (1.18 [1.09-1.29]), while a 43-minute increase in sleep offset time irregularity was associated with an 8.9% increase in hypertension (1.09 [1.001-1.18]).

Conclusions

These findings support that sleep irregularity, both in duration and timing, is a risk marker for poor cardiovascular health. Further mechanistic investigations of temporal relationships between day-to-day fluctuations in sleep duration and timing, next-day blood pressure, and other cardiovascular outcomes are warranted.

5. Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects

Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who take Cryselle. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance.

Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs.

Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs.

6. Headache

If a woman taking Cryselle develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Cryselle if indicated.

Consider discontinuation of Cryselle in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event).

7. Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea

Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting

Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different contraceptive product.

In 1,287 patients (pooled data from a number of studies), unscheduled bleeding was recorded in 15% of first cycles and by Cycle 12 was 5%. In total, 23% of subjects reported spotting, 20% reported unscheduled bleeding, and 2% reported change in menstrual flow at some point in the studies.

In the studies, 1.2% discontinued use of the product due to breakthrough bleeding and 1% discontinued due to spotting.

Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea

Women who use Cryselle may experience amenorrhea. A total of 9% of subjects in the studies reported amenorrhea in one or more cycles.

Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of COCs, especially when such a condition was preexistent.

If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.

8. Depression

Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue Cryselle if depression recurs to a serious degree.

SIDE EFFECTS OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES:

In addition to the risks and more serious side effects discussed above (see RISKS OF TAKING ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES, ESTIMATED RISK OF DEATH FROM A BIRTH CONTROL METHOD OR PREGNANCY and WARNING SIGNALS sections above), the following may also occur:

1. Vaginal Bleeding:

Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting may occur while you are taking the pills. Irregular bleeding may vary from slight staining between menstrual periods to breakthrough bleeding which is a flow much like a regular period. Irregular bleeding occurs most often during the first few months of oral contraceptive use, but may also occur after you have been taking the pill for some time. Such bleeding may be temporary and usually does not indicate any serious problems. It is important to continue taking your pills on schedule. If the bleeding occurs in more than one cycle or lasts for more than a few days, talk to your doctor or health care provider.

2. Gastrointestinal Effects:

The most frequent, unpleasant side effects are nausea and vomiting, stomach cramps, bloating, and a change in appetite.

3. Contact Lenses:

If you wear contact lenses and notice a change in vision or an inability to wear your lenses, contact your doctor or health care provider.

4. Fluid Retention:

Oral contraceptives may cause edema (fluid retention) with swelling of the fingers or ankles and may raise your blood pressure. If you experience fluid retention, contact your doctor or health care professional.

5. Melasma:

A spotty darkening of the skin is possible, particularly of the face.

6. Other Side Effects:

Other side effects may include change in appetite, headache, nervousness, depression, dizziness, loss of scalp hair, rash, and vaginal infections.

If any of these side effects bother you, call your doctor or health care professional.

### Menarche and time to cycle regularity among individuals born between 1950 and 2005 in the US [^e0d36d4e]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Birth Year and Age at Menarche

We grouped self-reported year of birth as 1950 to 1969 (n = 5223), 1970 to 1979 (n = 12 226), 1980 to 1989 (n = 22 086), 1990 to 1999 (n = 23 894), and 2000 to 2005 (n = 7912). Participants were asked the question, “ At what age did you have your first menstrual period? It’s okay to estimate,” with the following response options: “7 years old or younger,” integer options between 8 and 15 years old, “16 years old or older,” “I don’t know,” or “I prefer not to answer.” Those who indicated they did not know or preferred not to answer or did not respond were excluded. We derived the following measures: (1) age at menarche (in years) (we assigned the value of 7 to those aged ≤7 years [196 (0.3%)] and the value of 16 to those aged ≥16 years [2447 (3.4%)]); (2) early menarche (yes/no) (age at menarche <11 years); (3) very early menarche (yes/no) (age at menarche <9 years); and (4) late menarche (yes/no) (age at menarche ≥16 years).

Time to Cycle Regularity

Participants were asked, “After your first menstrual cycle, how long did it take for your cycle to become regular?” with the following response options: “less than 1 year,” “1-2 years,” “3-4 years,” “more than 5 years,” “after using hormones (eg, birth control pills),” “They’re not yet regular,” “I don’t know,” or “I prefer not to answer.” Those who indicated don’t know or prefer not to answer or who did not respond were considered missing. We further excluded 224 individuals with potentially inaccurate time-to-regularity information (eMethods in Supplement 1). For the remaining 61 932 participants, we categorized time to regularity as 2 years or less, 3 to 4 years, more than 5 years, not yet regular, or regular after using hormones.

### The correlation between menstrual characteristics and fertility in women of reproductive age: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^3abaca48]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Medium credibility.

Importance

Menstruation serves as an indicator of women's reproductive well-being and plays a pivotal role in their fertility; nevertheless, there remains an ongoing debate regarding the epidemiological evidence linking menstrual characteristics as well as fertility.

Objective

To explore the correlation between menstrual characteristics and fertility in women of reproductive age.

Data Sources

A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane libraries to identify research articles published up until February 9, 2024.

Study Selection and Synthesis

We included all studies in which the relationship between menstrual characteristics and pregnancy rates among women of reproductive age was investigated. We excluded studies involving the administration of oral contraceptives, the application of assisted reproductive technologies, and individuals with a documented history of infertility or partners with a known history of infertility.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Clinical pregnancy and miscarriage.

Result(S)

This meta-analysis was composed of nine studies involving a total of 399,966 women, and the evidential quality derived from these studies was deemed to be high with a low risk of bias. Compared with a normal menstrual cycle length (25-32 days), the impact of a short (<25 days) or long (>32 days) menstrual cycle on a woman's pregnancy was relatively insignificant ([odds ratio {OR}, 0.81; 95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.65-1.01; I 2 , 68%]; [OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.75-1.06; I 2 , 60%], respectively); however, a change in cycle length may increase the risk of miscarriage ([relative risk, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.11-3.15; I 2 , 0]; [relative risk, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.07, 2.57; I 2 , 43%], respectively). In comparison to women experiencing menarche at a typical age (12-14 years), those with a late age at menarche (>14 years) exhibited a decreased likelihood of pregnancy (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.91-0.93; I 2 , 0%); and compared with women experiencing a normal duration of menstrual bleeding (4-7 days), those with a short duration of menstrual bleeding (<4 days) exhibited reduced fertility potential (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.84-0.88; I 2 , 29%).

Conclusion(S)

Short and long menstrual cycle lengths may elevate women's susceptibility to spontaneous abortion, whereas late age at menarche as well as short duration of menstrual bleeding appear to be linked to diminished fertility among women of reproductive age.

### Measure do not guess: a call to action to end assumed and estimated menstrual cycle phases in research [^23e9cc8e]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The solution

The way to establish menstrual cycle phases in research (ie, laboratory and field-based studies) is clear: in addition to noting regular bleeding, investigators need to measure ovulation and progesterone, noting that the ideal frequency and modality of these measurements are still to be determined. Studies using this approach date back to the early 2000sand guidance on this approach has been produced several times within the last 5 years.Although this approach may be challenging in field-based studies, it is certainly not impossible.

### Association between reproductive health factors and musculoskeletal injuries in female Canadian armed forces members [^b63b8318]. Journal of Women's Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Background: Musculoskeletal injuries (MSKi) play a role in member retention in the military. In general, female military members have higher rates of MSKi than males and female reproductive health characteristics may be contributing to these disparities. This study seeks to characterize reproductive health factors in female Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) members and their relationship with MSKi. Materials and Methods: An electronic survey (SurveyMonkey ® ) was made available to present and former CAF members 18-65 years of age. Responses were collected between September 2020 and February 2021. Seven female reproductive characteristics were assessed: age of menarche, menstrual cycle regularity, birth control use, having given birth while serving, endometriosis, early menopause, and secondary oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea. Binary logistic regressions were used to analyze associations between reproductive characteristics with repetitive strain (RSI) and acute injuries. Results: A total of 2,001 participants consented to the survey with 855 respondents being female. Females reporting menstrual cycles as never regular, irregular for a few months, who never had a period, and whose periods stopped while serving presented a greater likelihood of reporting RSI compared to their peers who reported regular menstrual cycles (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.898, confidence interval [CI]: 1.138-3.166). Participants who have experienced endometriosis presented a higher likelihood of reporting acute injuries than those who did not (aOR: 2.426, CI: 1.030-5.709). Conclusion: This examination of females within the CAF suggests that irregular menstrual cycles or absent periods increase the likelihood of experiencing MSKi, namely those categorized as RSI injuries and reporting endometriosis were associated with greater rates of acute injuries.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 735: adolescents and long-acting reversible contraception: implants and intrauterine devices [^6614d473]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Contraceptive implants—adolescent bleeding changes and management—Obstetrician–gynecologists should counsel adolescents who choose an implant for contraception to expect changes in menstrual bleeding patterns throughout the duration of use, and in an analysis of 11 clinical trials including 942 etonogestrel implant users the most common patterns were infrequent bleeding in 33.3% of 90-day cycles, amenorrhea in 21.4% of cycles, prolonged bleeding in 16.9% of cycles, and frequent bleeding in 6.1% of cycles; early discontinuation rates among adolescents are generally low at approximately 10% within the first year, anticipatory guidance may improve satisfaction and continuation, there are no clinical parameters or risk factors that aid in predicting bleeding patterns, and bleeding in the first 3 months is broadly predictive of future patterns. For irregular bleeding, the CDC recommends consideration of two options—nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for short-term treatment (5–7 days) and hormonal treatment (if medically eligible) with low-dose combined oral contraceptives or estrogen for short-term treatment (10–20 days); limited clinical trial data suggest mefenamic acid, mifepristone with ethinyl estradiol or with doxycycline, and doxycycline alone decrease the length of bleeding episodes, and new-onset abnormal uterine bleeding not associated with initial placement should be evaluated similarly to non-LARC users and to IUD users with abnormal uterine bleeding.

### Repeated use of pre-and postcoital hormonal contraception for prevention of pregnancy [^aefeb360]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Repeated use of postcoital hormonal contraception is not currently recommended due to the higher risk of side effects and lower contraceptive effectiveness compared to other modern methods of contraception. However, emerging evidence indicates renewed interest in a regular coitally-dependent method of oral contraception. We evaluated the existing data on safety and effectiveness of pericoital use of levonorgestrel and other hormonal drugs to prevent pregnancy.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of repeated use of pre- and postcoital hormonal contraception for pregnancy prevention.

Search Methods

We searched until 1 September 2014 for trials that tested repeated pre- and postcoital use of hormonal drugs for pregnancy prevention. Databases included CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and POPLINE. We searched for current trials via ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP. For the initial review, we also searched EMBASE, CINAHL, and LILACS, and wrote to researchers to identify other trials.

Selection Criteria

We considered published and unpublished studies of repeated postcoital or immediately precoital use of hormonal drugs for contraception with pregnancy as an outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently confirmed eligibility and extracted data from the included studies. We calculated confidence intervals (CI) around individual study Pearl indices using a Poisson distribution. We presented individual study estimates and pooled estimates and their 95% CI, where appropriate.

Main Results

We found 22 trials that evaluated pericoital use of LNG and other hormonal drugs on a regular basis to prevent pregnancy. The studies included a total of 12,400 participants, and were conducted in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. The drugs and doses evaluated included levonorgestrel (LNG) 0.75 mg (11 studies), LNG in doses other than 0.75 mg (4 trials), and hormones other than LNG (7 trials). Outcomes included pregnancy rates, discontinuation, side effects, and acceptability.Pericoital levonorgestrel was reasonably efficacious and safe. The pooled Pearl Index for the 0.75 mg dose of LNG was 5.4 per 100 woman-years (95% CI 4.1 to 7.0). The pooled Pearl Index for all doses of LNG was 5.0 per 100 woman-years (95% CI 4.4 to 5.6). Other hormonal drugs appeared promising but most of them were not studied extensively. Menstrual irregularities were the most common side effects reported. However, the studies provided no consistent evidence of a relationship between bleeding abnormalities and either frequency of pill intake or total dose of the drug. Non-menstrual side effects were reportedly mild and not tabulated in most studies. Most women liked the pericoital method in spite of frequent menstrual irregularities.

Authors' Conclusions

The studies of pericoital LNG regimens provided promising results but many had serious methodological issues. Most reports were decades old and provided limited information. However, we considered the evidence to be moderate quality because of the large number of participants from diverse populations, the low pregnancy rates, and the consistent results across studies. Rigorous research is still needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of pericoital use of LNG as a primary means of contraception among women with infrequent intercourse. If the method is shown to be efficacious, safe and acceptable, the results may warrant revision of the current World Health Organization recommendations and marketing strategies.

### Practice bulletin no. 186 summary: long-acting reversible contraception: implants and intrauterine devices [^aaf3702d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Menstrual bleeding patterns and discontinuation with intrauterine devices (IUDs)—To improve long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) method satisfaction and continuation, counseling should include expected bleeding changes and reassurance that these changes are not harmful. In a randomized trial, long-term copper IUD users were more likely than LNG-20 IUD users to discontinue because of heavy menstrual bleeding and dysmenorrhea (9.7 per 100 women versus 1.3 per 100 respectively), whereas LNG-20 IUD users were more likely than copper IUD users to discontinue because of amenorrhea and spotting (4.3 per 100 women versus 0 per 100 women, respectively). Women should be advised that menstrual bleeding and cramping may initially increase with copper IUD use, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications are effective for dysmenorrhea or bothersome bleeding; reports of bleeding and dysmenorrhea decrease over time in copper IUD users. With LNG-IUDs, most women continue to ovulate and an increase in irregular or prolonged spotting is common during the first 90 days of use, with bleeding and spotting lessening over time; decreased bleeding has been reported with a second consecutive LNG-20 IUD compared with first-time use.

### Depression associated with hormonal contraceptive use as a risk indicator for postpartum depression [^1a515a3d]. JAMA Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Women are approximately twice as likely to develop depressive episodes compared with men.This gap between sexes starts during adolescence, which coincides with menarche in girls, and lasts until menopause.Hence, a woman’s reproductive life span is a time of heightened vulnerability for depression, aligning with an increased risk of depression associated with hormonal transitions across the menstrual cycle, when 3% to 8% of women experience premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD); the peripartum period, when approximately 13% of women experience postpartum depression (PPD); and the perimenopausal period, when large estradiol fluctuations predict risk of perimenopausal depression.Concerningly, initiating hormonal contraception (HC) also has been associated with an increased risk of developing a depressive episode.

Women experiencing depressive episodes associated with hormonal transitions may comprise a certain hormone-sensitive subgroup of women within the broader diagnostic category of major depressive disorder. Since treatment of major depressive disorder is far from optimal, identification of relevant subgroups with distinct etiologic contributions to the disorder and responsiveness to certain triggers or treatments would help to build a much-needed rationale for precision medicine in psychiatry. However, little is known about whether the depressive episodes across women’s reproductive lives share similar etiology or whether they are linked.Some evidence supports that women with PPD are more likely to have a history of PMDD and that women who experience depressive symptoms in perimenopause are more likely to have a history of PPD and PMDD. However, the evidence is based on retrospective reports susceptible to recall and confirmation biases and lack the use of confirmed clinical diagnoses and, therefore, represent only limited evidence. The few studies that have investigated depressive symptoms associated with hormonal transitions and HC-associated mood deterioration are likely underpowered and have shown inconsistent results.,, Therefore, large-scale observational studies spanning the reproductive age are needed to shed light on the complex associations between depressive episodes occurring throughout women’s lives.

This study takes advantage of Danish national health registers to evaluate the existence of a subgroup of women who are prone to develop depressive episodes across hormonal transitions, including transitions induced by exogenous hormone exposure in terms of HC. We examined whether such depressive episodes are associated with one another across a woman’s reproductive life span; specifically, we examined whether a history of a depressive episode associated with initiation of HC poses a higher risk for later PPD compared with a history of depression not associated with HC initiation.

### The direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccination on human ovarian granulosa cells explains menstrual irregularities [^792ae253]. NPJ Vaccines (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Historically, research concerning menstrual disorders has been sparse, largely due to unscientific notions linking menstrual bleeding with pollution and impurity. The COVID-19 pandemic revealed a critical gap in female health science, aggravating anxiety, ignorance, and vaccine hesitancy. During the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of women worldwide were vaccinated against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Though pre-clinical and retrospective clinical data agree as to the vaccine’s safety for fertility and pregnancy,, not long after administration of the first and second doses many women reported changes in their menstrual bleeding patterns. These reports were followed by peer-reviewed publications supporting these phenomena –, regardless of the vaccine brand –. The evidence points to short-term but statistically significant temporary changes in cycle length and flow,,,, most of which resume within one cycle,–. These changes could be associated with multiple characteristics such as women’s age, contraception type in use, ethnicity, the severity of other vaccine side effects, and more,. Nonetheless, the link between the day of the cycle at vaccination and menstrual changes is controversial,.

A link between menstrual irregularities and vaccine administration was demonstrated as early as 1913, tracking the typhoid vaccine; since then, it has been shown that hepatitis B and papilloma viruses vaccines affect the menstrual cycle as well,,,,. It was suggested that this side effect is a result of the immune response to the vaccine, activation of endometrial immune cells that regulate the generation of the endometrium, or immunological influence on the secretion of follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH),,. Examination of the COVID-19 vaccine pointed to an immunologic response, manifested by cytokine release (as Interleukin-8; IL-8). However, a direct effect of the vaccine on the ovary should be examined, as recent papers showed that ovarian cells could be directly infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and that the vaccine caused a biological response similar to that of prolactin signaling, which may lead to short-term menstrual irregularities.

Rotation Prep Published July 10, 2019 Common menstrual and bleeding abnormalities include the following: menorrhagia: excessively heavy flow metrorrhagia: uterine bleeding at irregular intervals oligomenorrhea: infrequent menstrual periods amenorrhea: absence of a menstrual period The PALM-COEIN classification system: Etiologies of abnormal uterine bleeding can be summarized with the acronym PALM-COEIN, divided into structural causes and nonstructural causes. Remember that, along with pregnancy, infections like chlamydia can also cause bleeding. coagulopathy structural causes thyroid disease endometriosis AAFP Algorithm for Evaluation and Treatment of Ovulatory Bleeding Anovulatory bleeding: Differential diagnosis is the same for oligo/amenorrhea, including pregnancy, thyroid disease, premature ovarian failure, perimenopause, and use of hormonal contraception.

AFP Algorithm for Evaluation and Treatment of Anovulatory Bleeding Up to 13% of women with heavy menstrual bleeding have some variant of von Willebrand’s syndrome, and up to 20% have underlying coagulation disorder. Initial workup includes a thorough history, including heavy bleeding since menarche, postpartum hemorrhage, surgery-related bleeding, bleeding with dental work, easy bruising, and epistaxis. For chronic treatment for menorrhagia, medical options include combined hormonal contraceptive, oral or injectable progestins, a subdermal implant or levonorgestrel IUD, and/or tranexamic acid. See the ACOG guidelines for additional information on treatment options. Endometrial sampling is not recommended for endometrial thickness ≤4 mm. Further evaluation is required for endometrial thickness ≥4 mm. Secondary amenorrhea is defined as the cessation of regular menses for 3 months or of irregular menses for 6 months.

Pregnancy is the most common cause of secondary amenorrhea and should be excluded in all cases; additional workup may include serum levels of luteinizing hormone, FSH, prolactin, and TSH.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^cc98b265]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Comments and evidence—ovulation timing and postpartum risk: During an average 28-day cycle, ovulation generally occurs during days 9–20, and the likelihood of ovulation is low from days 1–7 of the menstrual cycle. After a spontaneous or an induced abortion, ovulation can occur within 2–3 weeks and has been found to occur as early as 8–13 days after the end of the pregnancy; therefore, the likelihood of ovulation is low ≤7 days after an abortion. Among postpartum patients, the mean day of first ovulation among postpartum nonlactating women occurred 45–94 days after delivery, with the earliest ovulation reported at 25 days after delivery. Among women who are within 6 months postpartum, are fully or nearly fully breastfeeding (exclusively breastfeeding or the vast majority [≥85%] of feeds are breastfeeds), and are amenorrheic, the risk for pregnancy is <2%.

SIDE EFFECTS OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

In addition to the risks and more serious side effects discussed above (see RISKS OF TAKING ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES, ESTIMATED RISK OF DEATH FROM A BIRTH CONTROL METHOD OR PREGNANCY and WARNING SIGNALS sections), the following may also occur:

1. Irregular vaginal bleeding

Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting may occur while you are taking WYMZYA Fe. Irregular bleeding may vary from slight staining between menstrual periods to breakthrough bleeding which is a flow much like a regular period. Irregular bleeding occurs most often during the first few months of oral contraceptive use, but may also occur after you have been taking the pill for some time. Such bleeding may be temporary and usually does not indicate any serious problems. It is important to continue taking your pills on schedule. If the bleeding occurs in more than one cycle or lasts for more than a few days, talk to your healthcare provider.

2. Contact lenses

If you wear contact lenses and notice a change in vision or an inability to wear your lenses, contact your healthcare provider.

3. Fluid retention

Oral contraceptives may cause edema (fluid retention) with swelling of the fingers or ankles and may raise your blood pressure. If you experience fluid retention, contact your healthcare provider.

4. Melasma

A spotty darkening of the skin is possible, particularly of the face.

5. Other side effects

Other side effects may include nausea and vomiting, change in appetite, breast tenderness, headache, nervousness, depression, dizziness, loss of scalp hair, rash, vaginal infections, and allergic reactions.

### Expanding long-acting contraceptive options: a prospective cohort study of the hormonal intrauterine device, copper intrauterine device, and implants in Nigeria and Zambia [^2e303ef3]. The Lancet: Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

Findings from two different settings show high continuation rates and satisfaction across long-acting reversible contraceptives, including the hormonal intrauterine device, a method that has been largely underused in sub-Saharan Africa. Although preferences were not uniform, all long-acting reversible contraceptives shared characteristics that women appreciated within each country, including high effectiveness, convenience, and few side-effects in Nigeria and duration of protection, convenience, and discreetness in Zambia. Reduced or no bleeding emerged as an additional distinctive benefit of the hormonal intrauterine device in both countries.

Overall, although women's experiences varied, patterns of contraceptive-induced bleeding changes were consistent in our study with what has been reported for each long-acting reversible contraceptive in other studies.In general, side-effects are a key cause of discontinuation in sub-Saharan Africa.Although the Demographic and Health Surveys did not until recently differentiate between bleeding changes and non-bleeding side-effects, other available evidence suggests that bleeding changes can be particularly problematic.In our study, more women reported bleeding changes than other side-effects. Overall, bleeding disturbances inclusive of irregular periods and spotting, and increased bleeding emerged as negative aspects of using some long-acting reversible contraceptives. Although small sample sizes limit our ability to draw strong conclusions, increased bleeding and bleeding disturbances were also reasons for removing or wanting to remove a contraceptive method. At the same time, our findings highlight that reduced bleeding or amenorrhoea can have a positive effect on women's lives, which is consistent with other recent data from Nigeria and Zambia.Also, a large proportion of women using the hormonal intrauterine device reported using fewer menstrual products compared with before starting their method relative to other long-acting reversible contraceptives. Documented concerns associated with the financial burden of menstrual hygiene management suggest this effect could be an important benefit.In settings where concerns about amenorrhoea tend to persist, this effect could have the potential to increase acceptability.
