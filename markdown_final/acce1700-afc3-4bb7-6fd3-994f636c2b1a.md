## Question

Nanada for AKI

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what "Nanada" means in the context of acute kidney injury and how it relates to AKI management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "Nanada" appears in the provided AKI literature. Then, I should verify if this might be a misspelling or misremembering of a guideline, tool, or biomarker. Next, I will consider the most likely intended terms and briefly summarize their relevance to AKI. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically useful answer with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the presence of the exact term. I carefully scanned the titles, abstracts, and key sections of the provided references and did not find any occurrence of "Nanada" in relation to AKI, which makes me suspect a terminology error or a very niche/nonstandard term not captured here.

> Wait, let me verify the most plausible interpretations. Given the AKI context, "Nanada" could be a misremembering of NANDA, the nursing taxonomy for nursing diagnoses, which is sometimes invoked in AKI care plans but is not a medical treatment or biomarker itself. Alternatively, it could be a garbled reference to KDIGO, the dominant guideline for AKI definition and management, or to RIFLE/AKIN, the staging systems used in AKI research and practice. Less likely, it might reflect confusion with a biomarker acronym or a local protocol name, but none of those map cleanly to "Nanada" in the supplied sources [^26d69f51] [^2a4c7874] [^4300abcc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should double-check whether any AKI tool or score uses a similar-sounding acronym. I reviewed risk scores and biomarker frameworks in the packet and found no "Nanada" entry; instead, I see validated ICU AKI risk scores, COVID-19 AKI scores, and biomarker consensus statements, none of which align with "Nanada", reinforcing that this is likely a misnomer in this context [^942825be] [^85587bfa] [^2c7a36a3].

> Let me consider the clinical implications so I can still provide a useful answer. If the user meant NANDA, I should clarify that NANDA-I provides nursing diagnostic language (for example, Risk for decreased renal perfusion) that can structure nursing care plans around AKI, but it does not dictate medical therapy or biomarker use; it complements physician-directed management rather than replacing it. If the user meant KDIGO, I should confirm that KDIGO offers stage-based evaluation, removal of nephrotoxins, hemodynamic optimization, and indications for renal replacement therapy, which are the backbone of AKI care in most settings [^26d69f51] [^befd396d] [^a16b9cb9].

> I need to ensure I address biomarkers and staging, since those are common points of confusion. ADQI 2020 supports considering a combination of damage and functional biomarkers alongside clinical assessment to improve risk stratification and processes of care, but biomarkers are not yet replacements for creatinine/urine output–based AKI diagnosis; similarly, RIFLE and AKIN provide standardized severity staging that correlate with outcomes, yet management remains individualized beyond staging labels [^2c7a36a3] [^2a4c7874] [^1dc2ca40].

> But wait, what if the user truly intended a different, nonstandard local protocol or a brand name? I should acknowledge that possibility while noting that, within the provided evidence base, there is no "Nanada" AKI intervention, score, or biomarker; therefore, I cannot validate its use here. If more context is provided (for example, the institution, a description of what "Nanada" entails), I can refine the interpretation accordingly.

> In summary, I should confirm that "Nanada" does not appear in the supplied AKI literature and is most likely a misremembered reference to NANDA nursing diagnoses, KDIGO guidelines, or RIFLE/AKIN staging. Clinically, AKI management hinges on prompt cause assessment, stage-based supportive care, nephrotoxin removal, hemodynamic optimization, and timely nephrology consultation for severe or unclear cases, with biomarkers considered adjunctive rather than definitive tools [^26d69f51] [^befd396d] [^2c7a36a3].

I can't find a medical term or intervention called "Nanada" for AKI. Could you clarify what you meant? For example:

- **Did you mean NANDA** (nursing diagnoses) for AKI care planning?
- **Did you mean KDIGO** (the guideline for AKI definition and management)?
- **Did you mean a specific drug, biomarker, or protocol** (please name it)?

Once you confirm, I'll provide a precise, evidence-based answer. In the meantime, here are the **core AKI principles** from KDIGO and contemporary reviews: define AKI using serum creatinine/urine output thresholds, stage severity, identify and treat reversible causes, stop nephrotoxins, optimize volume/perfusion, monitor closely, and consider RRT for life-threatening indications; long-term, reassess at 3 months for CKD risk [^26d69f51] [^de312555] [^5ba54460].

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of acute kidney injury: a KDIGO summary (part 1) [^0b9ba918]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious problem affecting millions and causing death and disability for many. In 2012, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes completed the first ever, international, multidisciplinary, clinical practice guideline for AKI. The guideline is based on evidence review and appraisal, and covers AKI definition, risk assessment, evaluation, prevention, and treatment. In this review we summarize key aspects of the guideline including definition and staging of AKI, as well as evaluation and nondialytic management. Contrast-induced AKI and management of renal replacement therapy will be addressed in a separate review. Treatment recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant trials. Appraisal of the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Limitations of the evidence are discussed and a detailed rationale for each recommendation is provided.

### Evaluation and initial management of acute kidney injury [^ea993caa]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

The evaluation and initial management of patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) should include: (1) an assessment of the contributing causes of the kidney injury, (2) an assessment of the clinical course including comorbidities, (3) a careful assessment of volume status, and (4) the institution of appropriate therapeutic measures designed to reverse or prevent worsening of functional or structural kidney abnormalities. The initial assessment of patients with AKI classically includes the differentiation between prerenal, renal, and postrenal causes. The differentiation between so-called "prerenal" and "renal" causes is more difficult, especially because renal hypoperfusion may coexist with any stage of AKI. Using a modified Delphi approach, the multidisciplinary international working group, generated a set of testable research questions. Key questions included the following: Is there a difference in prognosis between volume-responsive and volume-unresponsive AKI? Are there biomarkers whose patterns (dynamic changes) predict the severity and recovery of AKI (maximal stage of AKI, need for RRT, renal recovery, mortality) and guide therapy? What is the best biomarker to assess prospectively whether AKI is volume responsive? What is the best biomarker to assess the optimal volume status in AKI patients? In evaluating the current literature and ongoing studies, it was thought that the answers to the questions posed herein would improve the understanding of AKI, and ultimately patient outcomes.

### Acute kidney injury: an increasing global concern [^3b833138]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Despite an increasing incidence of acute kidney injury in both high-income and low-income countries and growing insight into the causes and mechanisms of disease, few preventive and therapeutic options exist. Even small acute changes in kidney function can result in short-term and long-term complications, including chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease, and death. Presence of more than one comorbidity results in high severity of illness scores in all medical settings. Development or progression of chronic kidney disease after one or more episode of acute kidney injury could have striking socioeconomic and public health outcomes for all countries. Concerted international action encompassing many medical disciplines is needed to aid early recognition and management of acute kidney injury.

### Management of acute kidney injury: core curriculum 2018 [^ed1bdecd]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a heterogeneous disorder that is common in hospitalized patients and associated with short- and long-term morbidity and mortality. When AKI is present, prompt workup of the underlying cause should be pursued, with specific attention to reversible causes. Measures to prevent AKI include optimization of volume status and avoidance of nephrotoxic medications. Crystalloids are preferred over colloids for most patients, and hydroxyethyl starches should be avoided. Volume overload in the setting of AKI is associated with adverse outcomes, so attention should be paid to overall fluid balance. Currently there are no targeted pharmacotherapies approved for the treatment of AKI. The optimal timing of renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients with AKI is unclear, but is an area of active investigation. Recent studies suggest that AKI is not a "self-limited" process, but is strongly linked to increased risk for chronic kidney disease, subsequent AKI, and future mortality.

### Management of patients at risk of acute kidney injury [^b093fc67]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a multifaceted syndrome that occurs in different settings. The course of AKI can be variable, from single hit and complete recovery, to multiple hits resulting in end-stage renal disease. No interventions to improve outcomes of established AKI have yet been developed, so prevention and early diagnosis are key. Awareness campaigns and education for health-care professionals on diagnosis and management of AKI-with attention to avoidance of volume depletion, hypotension, and nephrotoxic interventions-coupled with electronic early warning systems where available can improve outcomes. Biomarker-based strategies have not shown improvements in outcome. Fluid management should aim for early, rapid restoration of circulatory volume, but should be more limited after the first 24–48 h to avoid volume overload. Use of balanced crystalloid solutions versus normal saline remains controversial. Renal replacement therapy should only be started on the basis of hard criteria, but should not be delayed when criteria are met. On the basis of recent evidence, the risk of contrast-induced AKI might be overestimated for many conditions.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^6fc7e06c]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) risk assessment and research needs — Among patients who developed AKI after hospital admission, there was "an unacceptable delay in recognizing AKI in 43% of those that developed the condition after admission", and "in a fifth of such patients its development was predictable and avoidable"; accordingly, "Their recommendations were simple: risk assessment for AKI as part of the initial evaluation of emergency admissions, along with appropriate serum biochemistry on admission and at frequent intervals thereafter". Research priorities include "Better delineation of risk for hospital- and community- acquired AKI is needed" and "Better delineation of the effects of age on the risk for AKI is needed", plus that "Studies are needed to develop and validate scoring systems for AKI risk prediction in various settings, in addition to cardiac surgery and exposure to radiocontrast material", that "Genome-wide association studies are needed to determine risk of AKI in different hospital settings and with respect to long-term outcomes", and that "Studies are needed on risk factors for the development of, recovery from, and long-term outcomes of community-acquired AKI, including sepsis, trauma, tropical infections, snake bites, and ingestion of toxic plants, etc".

### Acute kidney injury [^de312555]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common, heterogeneous, multifactorial condition, which is part of the overarching syndrome of acute kidney diseases and disorders. This condition's incidence highest in low-income and middle-income countries. In the short term, AKI is associated with increased mortality, an increased risk of complications, extended stays in hospital, and high health-care costs. Long-term complications include chronic kidney disease, kidney failure, cardiovascular morbidity, and an increased risk of death. Several strategies are available to prevent and treat AKI in specific clinical contexts. Otherwise, AKI care is primarily supportive, focused on treatment of the underlying cause, prevention of further injury, management of complications, and short-term renal replacement therapy in case of refractory complications. Evidence confirming that AKI subphenotyping is necessary to identify precision-oriented interventions is growing. Long-term follow-up of individuals recovered from AKI is recommended but the most effective models of care remain unclear.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) risk assessment, testing, and follow-up — The cause of AKI should be determined whenever possible. We recommend that patients be stratified for risk of AKI according to their susceptibilities and exposures (1B), and manage patients according to their susceptibilities and exposures to reduce the risk of AKI. Test patients at increased risk for AKI with measurements of SCr and urine output to detect AKI. Evaluate patients with AKI promptly to determine the cause, with special attention to reversible causes. Monitor patients with AKI with measurements of SCr and urine output to stage the severity, according to Recommendation 2.1.2. Manage patients with AKI according to the stage (see Figure 4) and cause. Evaluate patients 3 months after AKI for resolution, new onset, or worsening of pre-existing CKD; if patients have CKD, manage these patients as detailed in the KDOQI CKD Guideline (Guidelines 7–15); if patients do not have CKD, consider them to be at increased risk for CKD and care for them as detailed in the KDOQI CKD Guideline 3 for patients at increased risk for CKD.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^1c9841a4]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Rationale for a guideline on AKI — AKI is a global problem with immediate and long-term adverse outcomes, more prevalent in and a significant risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD), with individuals with CKD especially susceptible; the burden may be greatest in developing countries, and early detection to prevent progression to kidney failure requiring dialysis is of paramount importance, yet preventable risk factors are not widely known and variably practiced.

### Recommendations on acute kidney injury biomarkers from the Acute Disease Quality Initiative consensus conference: a consensus statement [^2c7a36a3]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

In the last decade, new biomarkers for acute kidney injury (AKI) have been identified and studied in clinical trials. Guidance is needed regarding how best to incorporate them into clinical practice.

Objective

To develop recommendations on AKI biomarkers based on existing data and expert consensus for practicing clinicians and researchers.

Evidence Review

At the 23rd Acute Disease Quality Initiative meeting, a meeting of 23 international experts in critical care, nephrology, and related specialties, the panel focused on 4 broad areas, as follows: (1) AKI risk assessment; (2) AKI prediction and prevention; (3) AKI diagnosis, etiology, and management; and (4) AKI progression and kidney recovery. A literature search revealed more than 65 000 articles published between 1965 and May 2019. In a modified Delphi process, recommendations and consensus statements were developed based on existing data, with 90% agreement among panel members required for final adoption. Recommendations were graded using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations system.

Findings

The panel developed 11 consensus statements for biomarker use and 14 research recommendations. The key suggestions were that a combination of damage and functional biomarkers, along with clinical information, be used to identify high-risk patient groups, improve the diagnostic accuracy of AKI, improve processes of care, and assist the management of AKI.

Conclusions and Relevance

Current evidence from clinical studies supports the use of new biomarkers in prevention and management of AKI. Substantial gaps in knowledge remain, and more research is necessary.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^4300abcc]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

KDIGO/KDOQI AKI definition, staging, and performance measures — the definition and staging system provides an important tool for epidemiologic studies and trial design, but there is insufficient validation for its use in diagnosis and clinical management, and we do not believe that there are sufficient data to support use of the stage-based management approach; rather, management of patients with AKI should be based on assessment of overall clinical status; although AKI is an important risk factor for CKD, the majority of patients with mild, readily reversible AKI are at relatively low risk of progressive CKD; from a U.S. public health standpoint, follow-up should be targeted to the highest risk populations; the KDIGO recommendations for definition and staging of adult AKI should not be used for the development of clinical performance measures, and administrative coding for AKI should not be based solely on this definition and staging system.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^1777a63c]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) recommendations — rating framework and implications are defined as follows: "Within each recommendation, the strength of recommendation is indicated as Level 1, Level 2, or Not Graded, and the quality of the supporting evidence is shown as A, B, C, or D". Level 1 ("We recommend") implies for patients that "Most people in your situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not", for clinicians that "Most patients should receive the recommended course of action", and for policy that "The recommendation can be evaluated as a candidate for developing a policy or a performance measure". Level 2 ("We suggest") implies for patients that "The majority of people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not", for clinicians that "Different choices will be appropriate for different patients. Each patient needs help to arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and preferences", and for policy that "The recommendation is likely to require substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders before policy can be determined". The additional category "Not Graded" "was used, typically, to provide guidance based on common sense or where the topic does not allow adequate application of evidence", and "are generally written as simple declarative statements, but are not meant to be interpreted as being stronger recommendations than Level 1 or 2 recommendations". Evidence quality meanings are: A (High) — "We are confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect". B (Moderate) — "The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different". C (Low) — "The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect". D (Very low) — "The estimate of effect is very uncertain, and often will be far from the truth".

### Contrast-induced acute kidney injury and renal support for acute kidney injury: a KDIGO summary (part 2) [^0998c5a6]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious problem affecting millions and causing death and disability for many. In 2012, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes completed the first ever international multidisciplinary clinical practice guideline for AKI. The guideline is based on evidence review and appraisal, and covers AKI definition, risk assessment, evaluation, prevention, and treatment. Two topics, contrast-induced AKI and management of renal replacement therapy, deserve special attention because of the frequency in which they are encountered and the availability of evidence. Recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant trials. Appraisal of the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Limitations of the evidence are discussed and a detailed rationale for each recommendation is provided. This review is an abridged version of the guideline and provides additional rationale and commentary for those recommendation statements that most directly impact the practice of critical care.

### Acute kidney injury network: report of an initiative to improve outcomes in acute kidney injury [^ada0a8fb]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusion

AKI is a complex disorder for which there is no currently accepted uniform definition. Having a standard for diagnosing and classifying AKI would enhance our ability to improve the management of these patients. We have described the formation of a multidisciplinary collaborative network focused on AKI and have proposed uniform standards for diagnosing and classifying AKI. The proposed standards will need to be validated in future studies. These standards build upon existing knowledge and permit individuals using current staging systems (for example, RIFLE) to transition to the new system without loss of comparability. These recommendations have been endorsed by the participating societies, which represent the majority of the critical care and nephrology societies worldwide and which have been asked to disseminate the results via presentations at the national and regional society conferences and through publication of summary reports in society journals (see Table 5 for society endorsement details). We believe that these recommendations provide a stepping stone to standardizing the care of patients with AKI and will greatly enhance our ability to design prospective studies to evaluate potential prevention and treatment strategies. One of the limitations of consensus recommendations is that they are often not adopted. We anticipate that the broad support and commitment obtained through society involvement will significantly enhance the ability to disseminate the results to the worldwide community and to address this limitation. Future clinical and translational research in AKI will require the development of collaborative networks of investigators drawn from various disciplines to facilitate the acquisition of evidence through well-designed and well-conducted clinical trials, dissemination of information via multidisciplinary joint conferences and publications, and improvement of the translation of knowledge from pre-clinical research. We anticipate that the AKIN will provide an effective mechanism for facilitating efforts to improve patient outcomes.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^03899f8c]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO acute kidney injury evaluation and stage-based management — Initial assessment, monitoring, nephrotoxin exposure, hemodynamic assessment, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk management are outlined as follows: Laboratory parameters — including SCr, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and electrolytes, complete blood count and differential — should be obtained, and urine analysis and microscopic examination as well as urinary chemistries may be helpful in determining the underlying cause of AKI; imaging tests, especially ultrasound, are important components of the evaluation for patients with AKI. Individualize frequency and duration of monitoring based on patient risk, exposure and clinical course, and it is advisable to tailor management to AKI stage. While stage-based actions provide a starting point, they are neither complete nor mandatory for an individual patient, and the measurement of urine output does not imply that the urinary bladder catheterization is mandatory for all patients. Nephrotoxic drugs account for some part of AKI in 20–30% of patients, and it seems prudent to limit exposure to these agents whenever possible and to weigh the risk of developing or worsening AKI against the risk associated with not using the agent. To ensure adequate circulating blood volume, static variables like central venous pressure are not nearly as useful as dynamic variables, such as pulse-pressure variation, inferior vena cava filling by ultrasound and echocardiographic appearance of the heart. Since AKI is a risk factor for CKD, it is important to evaluate patients with AKI for new onset or worsening of pre-existing CKD; if patients have CKD, manage patients as detailed in the KDOQI CKD Guideline (Guidelines 7–15), and if patients do not have CKD, consider them to be at increased risk for CKD and care for them as detailed in the KDIGO CKD Guideline 3 for patients at increased risk for CKD.

### ASN kidney health guidance on the outpatient management of patients with dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury [^ccf7146f]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

ASN Kidney Health Guidance — AKI-D recovery prognosis and individualized management notes that outpatient recovery of kidney function ranges from 20% to 60% of patients and that at 6 months after discharge, 31% of patients with AKI-D achieved dialysis independence. Baseline kidney function is identified as the strongest predictive factor, and even among stage 4 CKD (chronic kidney disease), up to 20%–30% of patients will experience recovery. Because of poor predictive accuracy, it is appropriate to err on the side of assuming that most patients will recover, and therefore, all patients should initially receive AKI-D–specific individualized care; for patients with a high likelihood of recovery of kidney function, it is appropriate to maintain this approach for at least 90 days after discharge. Conversely, for patients with low likelihood for recovery, earlier designation of ESRD (end-stage renal disease) diagnosis may be appropriate, and for those with significant comorbidities, nephrologists should facilitate shared goals-of-care discussions, including advanced care planning and palliative care options.

### Controversies in acute kidney injury: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^c4f500a4]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

In 2012, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) published a guideline on the classification and management of acute kidney injury (AKI). The guideline was derived from evidence available through February 2011. Since then, new evidence has emerged that has important implications for clinical practice in diagnosing and managing AKI. In April of 2019, KDIGO held a controversies conference entitled Acute Kidney Injury with the following goals: determine best practices and areas of uncertainty in treating AKI; review key relevant literature published since the 2012 KDIGO AKI guideline; address ongoing controversial issues; identify new topics or issues to be revisited for the next iteration of the KDIGO AKI guideline; and outline research needed to improve AKI management. Here, we present the findings of this conference and describe key areas that future guidelines may address.

### Contrast-associated acute kidney injury: an update of risk factors, risk factor scores, and preventive measures [^e88722ad]. Clinical Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

As lifespans lengthen, age-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes are becoming more prevalent. Correspondingly, the use of contrast agents for medical imaging is also becoming more common, and there is increasing awareness of contrast-associated acute kidney injury (CA-AKI). There is no specific treatment for CA-AKI, and clinicians currently focus on prevention, interventions that alter its pathogenesis, and identification of risk factors. Although the incidence of CA-AKI is low in the general population, the risk of CA-AKI can reach 20% to 30% in patients with multiple risk factors. Many models have been applied in the clinic to assess the risk factors for CA-AKI, enable identification of high-risk groups, and improve clinical management. Hypotonic or isotonic contrast media are recommended to prevent CA-AKI in high-risk patients. Patients with risk factors should avoid using contrast media multiple times within a short period of time. All nephrotoxic drugs should be stopped at least 24 h before the administration of contrast media in high-risk populations, and adequate hydration is recommended for all patients. This review summarizes the pathophysiology of CA-AKI and the progress in diagnosis and differential diagnosis; updates the risk factors and risk factor scoring systems; reviews the latest advances related to prevention and treatment; discusses current problems in epidemiological studies; and highlights the importance of identifying high-risk subjects to control modifiable risk factors and use of a rating scale to estimate the risk and implement appropriate prevention strategies.

### Prediction of mortality and major adverse kidney events in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury [^4d820d63]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Risk prediction tools for assisting acute kidney injury (AKI) management have focused on AKI onset but have infrequently addressed kidney recovery. We developed clinical models for risk stratification of mortality and major adverse kidney events (MAKE) in critically ill patients with incident AKI.

Study Design

Multicenter cohort study.

Setting & Participants

9,587 adult patients admitted to heterogeneous intensive care units (ICUs; March 2009 to February 2017) who experienced AKI within the first 3 days of their ICU stays.

Predictors

Multimodal clinical data consisting of 71 features collected in the first 3 days of ICU stay.

Outcomes

(1) Hospital mortality and (2) MAKE, defined as the composite of death during hospitalization or within 120 days of discharge, receipt of kidney replacement therapy in the last 48 hours of hospital stay, initiation of maintenance kidney replacement therapy within 120 days, or a ≥ 50% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline to 120 days from hospital discharge.

Analytical Approach

Four machine-learning algorithms (logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, and extreme gradient boosting) and the SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) framework were used for feature selection and interpretation. Model performance was evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation and external validation.

Results

One developed model including 15 features outperformed the SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) score for the prediction of hospital mortality, with areas under the curve of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.79–0.80) and 0.71 (95% CI, 0.71–0.71) in the development cohort and 0.74 (95% CI, 0.73–0.74) and 0.71 (95% CI, 0.71–0.71) in the validation cohort (P < 0.001 for both). A second developed model including 14 features outperformed KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) AKI severity staging for the prediction of MAKE: 0.78 (95% CI, 0.78–0.78) versus 0.66 (95% CI, 0.66–0.66) in the development cohort and 0.73 (95% CI, 0.72–0.74) versus 0.67 (95% CI, 0.67–0.67) in the validation cohort (P < 0.001 for both).

Limitations

The models are applicable only to critically ill adult patients with incident AKI within the first 3 days of an ICU stay.

Conclusions

The reported clinical models exhibited better performance for mortality and kidney recovery prediction than standard scoring tools commonly used in critically ill patients with AKI in the ICU. Additional validation is needed to support the utility and implementation of these models.

Plain-Language Summary

Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs commonly in critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Prediction of mortality and recovery after an episode of AKI may assist bedside decision making. In this report, we describe the development and validation of a clinical model using data from the first 3 days of an ICU stay to predict hospital mortality and major adverse kidney events occurring as long as 120 days after hospital discharge among critically ill adult patients who experienced AKI within the first 3 days of an ICU stay. The proposed clinical models exhibited good performance for outcome prediction and, if further validated, could enable risk stratification for timely interventions that promote kidney recovery.

KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) guideline states that the KDIGO definition and staging criteria are "appropriate for defining the epidemiology of AKI and in the design of clinical trials", but concludes "there is insufficient evidence to support their widespread application to clinical care in the United States". The panel "generally concurred with the remainder of the KDIGO guidelines that are focused on the prevention and pharmacologic and dialytic management of AKI", while emphasizing "the dearth of clinical trial evidence to provide strong evidence-based recommendations" and "the continued absence of effective therapies beyond hemodynamic optimization and avoidance of nephrotoxins for the prevention and treatment of AKI". For clinical context, AKI "represents the sudden loss of kidney function, generally occurring over the course of hours to days and resulting in the retention of metabolic waste products and the development of volume overload and electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities".

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a complex disorder comprising several etiological factors and occurring in multiple settings. The disorder has a variety of clinical manifestations that range from minimal elevation in serum creatinine level to anuric renal failure. We describe the formation of a multidisciplinary collaborative network focused on AKI. This Acute Kidney Injury Network has proposed uniform standards for diagnosing and classifying AKI. These proposed standards will need to be validated in future studies, a process that will be facilitated by the Acute Kidney Injury Network, which offers a forum that encourages acquisition of knowledge to improve patient outcomes.

KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) diagnostic timeframes and staging — diagnosis uses either change in serum creatinine (SCr) within 1 week or a 0.3 mg/dl (26.5 μmol/l) increase within 48 hours (Recommendation 2.1.1). The 1-week or 48-hour periods may occur at any time and are for diagnosis, not staging; staging spans the entire episode, such that a 50% SCr increase in 5 days that ultimately reaches a three-fold increase over 3 weeks would be diagnosed as AKI and staged as Stage 3.

### Acute kidney injury: global health alert [^a3b51c0b]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is increasingly prevalent in developing and developed countries and is associated with severe morbidity and mortality. Most etiologies of AKI can be prevented by interventions at the individual, community, regional and in-hospital levels. Effective measures must include community-wide efforts to increase an awareness of the devastating effects of AKI and provide guidance on preventive strategies, as well as early recognition and management. Efforts should be focused on minimizing causes of AKI, increasing awareness of the importance of serial measurements of serum creatinine in high-risk patients, and documenting urine volume in acutely ill people to achieve early diagnosis; there is as yet no definitive role for alternative biomarkers. Protocols need to be developed to systematically manage prerenal conditions and specific infections. More accurate data about the true incidence and clinical impact of AKI will help to raise the importance of the disease in the community, and increase awareness of AKI by governments, the public, general and family physicians and other healthcare professionals to help prevent the disease. Prevention is the key to avoid the heavy burden of mortality and morbidity associated with AKI.

KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury (AKI) — KDOQI US commentary conclusion states that the work group "recognizes the need for a consensus definition of AKI and commends KDIGO for harmonizing the prior definitions and staging criteria", but "do not believe that it is sufficiently validated for use in the diagnosis and clinical management of patients with AKI", and that management "should be based on assessment of overall clinical status, including specific cause of AKI, trends in kidney function over time, comorbid conditions, assessment of volume status, and concomitant acid-base and electrolyte disturbances". For prevention and nondialytic management, they "generally agreed" yet "note the paucity of high-level evidence and the absence of highly effective therapies", and "can support the use of protocol-based management of perioperative patients and patients with sepsis" while stating such protocols "need to be further developed and validated" and that they "do not believe that there are sufficient data to benchmark care". Regarding renal replacement therapy (RRT), "we are in general agreement with the KDIGO recommendations", but "Given the lack of FDA-approved citrate solutions for regional anticoagulation during CRRT, we do not believe that this approach can be currently recommended; however, we believe that this will need to be reconsidered if appropriate citrate solutions become available". They also note that KDIGO provides "little discussion of the modalities of PIRRT" and "believe that these modalities are a reasonable alternative to CRRT in hemodynamically unstable patients".

### Characterization of risk prediction models for acute kidney injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^7d4fd572]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the nature and performance of the many published acute kidney injury (AKI) prediction models across major clinical subsettings, and what is their clinical utility?

Findings

This systematic review and meta-analysis of 150 reported AKI prediction models, with 14.4 million participants, found high variability in study designs, populations examined, AKI definitions used, and model assessments, with most studies deemed at high risk of bias. While the overall discrimination of these models appeared high, there was high between-study heterogeneity that could not be ascribed to any particular variable other than geographical region.

Meaning

In this study, the discrimination of published AKI prediction models appeared good, but the wide variation in the clinical settings, populations, and predictive variables, along with high statistical heterogeneity, limit their clinical utility.

Over the last decade there has been considerable progress in the discovery and development of biomarkers of kidney disease, and several have now been evaluated in different clinical settings. Although there is a growing literature on the performance of various biomarkers in clinical studies, there is limited information on how these biomarkers would be utilized by clinicians to manage patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). Recognizing this gap in knowledge, we convened the 10th Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative meeting to review the literature on biomarkers in AKI and their application in clinical practice. We asked an international group of experts to assess four broad areas for biomarker utilization for AKI: risk assessment, diagnosis, and staging; differential diagnosis; prognosis and management; and novel physiological techniques including imaging. This article provides a summary of the key findings and recommendations of the group, to equip clinicians to effectively use biomarkers in AKI.

### Stratification of acute kidney injury in COVID-19 [^b6048a2c]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Before the era of CKD staging, AKI was considered as reversible with satisfactory renal outcomes. However, with the recent advancements in renal care, it is widely accepted that patients who survive an episode of AKI might recover adequate renal functions, but still such patients are at risk of developing CKD. Considering the widespread nature of the disease and substantial number of patients with atypical manifestations, subsequent renal deterioration following an episode of AKI may pose substantial risks of CKD among survivors. We urge early stratification of AKI during COVID-19 case management which would provide opportunity to clinicians for appropriate management in a timely manner. Moreover, the follow-up of patients to ascertain the renal recovery will be of paramount importance to design and implement intervention strategies for high-risk patients.

### Characterization of risk prediction models for acute kidney injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^33ba35fd]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

This comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of AKI prediction models highlighted important limitations and challenges in this field, which profoundly limit the clinical utility of this literature in preventing AKI or defining high-risk populations in which preventative treatments can be tested. While no specific factors were found to drive the between-study heterogeneity, the high variability in the study populations, reported outcomes, and predictive variables are limiting the ability of studies to improve the outcomes of patients with AKI. More standardized approaches to the development and validation of prediction models are urgently needed and should cover aspects including study population selection, predictive variables selection, data analysis, performance assessment, and reporting paradigm.

### Raising awareness of acute kidney injury: a global perspective of a silent killer [^29641350]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

Worldwide, acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with poor patient outcomes. Over the last few years, collaborative efforts, enabled by a common definition of AKI, have provided a description of the epidemiology, natural history, and outcomes of this disease and improved our understanding of the pathophysiology. There is increased recognition that AKI is encountered in multiple settings and in all age groups, and that its course and outcomes are influenced by the severity and duration of the event. The effect of AKI on an individual patient and the resulting societal burden that ensues from the long-term effects of the disease, including development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), is attracting increasing scrutiny. There is evidence of marked variation in the management of AKI, which is, to a large extent, due to a lack of awareness and an absence of standards for prevention, early recognition, and intervention. These emerging data point to an urgent need for a global effort to highlight that AKI is preventable, its course is modifiable, and its treatment can improve outcomes. In this article, we provide a framework of reference and propose specific strategies to raise awareness of AKI globally, with the goal to ultimately improve outcomes from this devastating disease.

### Initiative: recommendations for awareness, recognition, and management of AKI [^5736639c]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

The American Society of Nephrology has established a new initiative, AKI!Now, with the goal of promoting excellence in the prevention and treatment of AKI by building a foundational program that transforms education and delivery of AKI care, aiming to reduce morbidity and associated mortality and to improve long-term outcomes. In this article, we describe our current efforts to improve early recognition and management involving inclusive interdisciplinary collaboration between providers, patients, and their families; discuss the ongoing need to change some of our current AKI paradigms and diagnostic methods; and provide specific recommendations to improve AKI recognition and care. In the hospital and the community, AKI is a common and increasingly frequent condition that generates risks of adverse events and high costs. Unfortunately, patients with AKI may frequently have received less than optimal quality of care. New classifications have facilitated understanding of AKI incidence and its impact on outcomes, but they are not always well aligned with AKI pathophysiology. Despite ongoing research efforts, treatments to promote or hasten kidney recovery remain ineffective. To avoid progression, the current approach to AKI emphasizes the promotion of early recognition and timely response. However, a lack of awareness of the importance of early recognition and treatment among health care team members and the heterogeneity of approaches within the health care teams assessing the patient remains a major challenge. Early identification is further complicated by differences in settings where AKI occurs (the community or the hospital), and by differences in patient populations and cultures between the intensive care unit and ward environments. To address these obstacles, we discuss the need to improve education at all levels of care and to generate specific guidance on AKI evaluation and management, including the development of a widely applicable education and an AKI management toolkit, engaging hospital administrators to incorporate AKI as a quality initiative, and raising awareness of AKI as a complication of other disease processes.

KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) evaluation — AKI is a clinical syndrome with multiple etiologies and is heterogeneous, guiding a thorough clinical assessment. The clinical evaluation of AKI includes a careful history and physical examination. Drug history should include over-the-counter formulations and herbal remedies or recreational drugs. The social history should include exposure to tropical diseases (e.g., malaria), waterways or sewage systems, and exposure to rodents (e.g., leptospirosis, hantavirus). Physical examination should include evaluation of fluid status, signs for acute and chronic heart failure, infection, and sepsis. Measurement of cardiac output, preload, preload responsiveness, and intra-abdominal pressure should be considered. Figure 5 illustrates an approach to evaluation of AKI.

Providing high-quality care for patients with AKI or those at risk of AKI occurs across a continuum that starts at the community level and continues in the emergency department, hospital setting, and after discharge from inpatient care. Improving the quality of care provided to these patients, plausibly mitigating the cost of care and improving short- and long-term outcomes, are goals that have not been universally achieved. Therefore, understanding how the management of AKI may be amenable to quality improvement programs is needed. Recognizing this gap in knowledge, the 22nd Acute Disease Quality Initiative meeting was convened to discuss the evidence, provide recommendations, and highlight future directions for AKI-related quality measures and care processes. Using a modified Delphi process, an international group of experts including physicians, a nurse practitioner, and pharmacists provided a framework for current and future quality improvement projects in the area of AKI. Where possible, best practices in the prevention, identification, and care of the patient with AKI were identified and highlighted. This article provides a summary of the key messages and recommendations of the group, with an aim to equip and encourage health care providers to establish quality care delivery for patients with AKI and to measure key quality indicators.

### AGA clinical practice update on the evaluation and management of acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis: expert review [^ed73f1b6]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) in cirrhosis — future directions in management focus on prevention, biomarkers, renal replacement therapy (RRT), transplantation, and outcomes. Priorities include "prevention of and protection against kidney injury: better definition of role of intravenous albumin and oral vasoconstrictors"; biomarker development for "early diagnosis of AKI independent of serum creatinine", "distinguishing between types of AKI without kidney biopsy", and "predicting reversibility and irreversibility"; establishing "initiation and stopping rules for renal replacement therapy"; transplantation priorities such as "maintaining priority for liver transplantation in patients who respond to pharmacological treatment of HRS-AKI" and identifying "markers to identify patients who require simultaneous liver kidney transplantation vs liver transplantation alone"; and "development and validation of patient-reported outcomes".

### Harmonizing acute and chronic kidney disease definition and classification: report of a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) consensus conference [^204810fc]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

Kidney disease is an important public health problem. Both acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease have been well defined and classified, leading to improved research efforts and subsequent management strategies and recommendations. For those patients with abnormalities in kidney function and/or structure who meet neither the definition of AKI nor chronic kidney disease, there remains a gap in research, care, and guidance. The term acute kidney diseases and disorders, abbreviated to acute kidney disease (AKD), has been introduced as an important construct to address this. To expand and harmonize existing definitions and to ultimately better inform research and clinical care, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) organized a consensus workshop. Multiple invitees from around the globe, representing both acute and chronic kidney disease researchers and experts, met virtually to examine existing data, and discuss key concepts related to AKD. Despite some remaining unresolved questions, conference attendees reached general consensus on the definition and classification of AKD, management strategies, and research priorities. AKD is defined by abnormalities of kidney function and/or structure with implications for health and with a duration of ≤ 3 months. AKD may include AKI, but, more importantly, also includes abnormalities in kidney function that are not as severe as AKI or that develop over a period of > 7 days. The cause(s) of AKD should be sought, and classification includes functional and structural parameters. Management of AKD is currently based on empirical considerations. A robust research agenda to enable refinement and validation of definitions and classification systems, and thus testing of interventions and strategies, is proposed.

### Recognition and management of acute kidney injury in the international society of nephrology 0by25 global snapshot: a multinational cross-sectional study [^82952659]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

Epidemiological data for acute kidney injury are scarce, especially in low-income countries (LICs) and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs). We aimed to assess regional differences in acute kidney injury recognition, management, and outcomes.

Methods

In this multinational cross-sectional study, 322 physicians from 289 centres in 72 countries collected prospective data for paediatric and adult patients with confirmed acute kidney injury in hospital and non-hospital settings who met criteria for acute kidney injury. Signs and symptoms at presentation, comorbidities, risk factors for acute kidney injury, and process-of-care data were obtained at the start of acute kidney injury, and need for dialysis, renal recovery, and mortality recorded at 7 days, and at hospital discharge or death, whichever came earlier. We classified countries into high-income countries (HICs), upper-middle-income countries (UMICs), and combined LICs and LMICs (LLMICs) according to their 2014 gross national income per person.

Findings

Between Sept 29 and Dec 7, 2014, data were collected from 4018 patients. 2337 (58%) patients developed community-acquired acute kidney injury, with 889 (80%) of 1118 patients in LLMICs, 815 (51%) of 1594 in UMICs, and 663 (51%) of 1241 in HICs (for HICs vs UMICs p = 0.33; p < 0.0001 for all other comparisons). Hypotension (1615 [40%] patients) and dehydration (1536 [38%] patients) were the most common causes of acute kidney injury. Dehydration was the most frequent cause of acute kidney injury in LLMICs (526 [46%] of 1153 vs 518 [32%] of 1605 in UMICs vs 492 [39%] of 1260 in HICs) and hypotension in HICs (564 [45%] of 1260 vs 611 [38%%] of 1605 in UMICs vs 440 [38%] of 1153 LLMICs). Mortality at 7 days was 423 (11%) of 3855, and was higher in LLMICs (129 [12%] of 1076) than in HICs (125 [10%] of 1230) and UMICs (169 [11%] of 1549).

Interpretation

We identified common aetiological factors across all countries, which might be amenable to a standardised approach for early recognition and treatment of acute kidney injury. Study limitations include a small number of patients from outpatient settings and LICs, potentially under-representing the true burden of acute kidney injury in these areas. Additional strategies are needed to raise awareness of acute kidney injury in community health-care settings, especially in LICs.

### Acute kidney injury and tools for risk-stratification in 456 patients with hantavirus-induced nephropathia epidemica [^bce12a8f]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Puumala virus (PUUV) is the most common species of hantavirus in Central Europe. Nephropathia epidemica (NE), caused by PUUV, is characterized by acute kidney injury (AKI) and thrombocytopenia. The major goals of this study were to provide a clear clinical phenotyping of AKI in patients with NE and to develop an easy prediction rule to identify patients, who are at lower risk to develop severe AKI.

Methods

A cross-sectional prospective survey of 456 adult patients with serologically confirmed NE was performed. Data were collected from medical records and prospectively at follow-up visit. Severe AKI was defined by standard criteria according to the RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-stage kidney disease) classification. Fuller statistical models were developed and validated to estimate the probability for severe AKI.

Results

During acute NE, 88% of the patients had AKI according to the RILFE criteria during acute NE. A risk index score for severe AKI was derived by using three independent risk factors in patients with normal kidney function at time of diagnosis: thrombocytopenia [two points; odds ratios (OR): 3.77; 95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.82, 8.03], elevated C-reactive protein levels (one point; OR: 3.02; 95% CI: 1.42, 6.58) and proteinuria (one point; OR: 3.92; 95% CI: 1.33, 13.35). On the basis of a point score of one or two, the probability of severe AKI was 0.18 and 0.28 with an area under the curve of 0.71.

Conclusion

This clinical prediction rule provides a novel and diagnostically accurate strategy for the potential prevention and improved management of kidney complications in patients with NE and, ultimately, for a possible decrease in unnecessary hospitalization in a high number of patients.

### Unraveling the epidemiology of acute kidney injury recovery [^113ccf38]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication among hospitalized patients and is associated with significant long-term morbidity, including the development of major adverse kidney events such as kidney failure. By definition, AKI holds the promise of potential kidney recovery, yet clearly not all patients will recover, and some will develop worsening kidney function even after initial recovery. Being able to identify which patients with AKI will recover vs have persistent or future kidney complications is a critically important question, both for counseling patients and for determining appropriate care of AKI survivors. In this article, we review and describe the key factors associated with kidney function nonrecovery after AKI, some of which are modifiable and may be future targets for intervention. We also describe recent studies developing clinical risk scores to predict post-AKI kidney outcomes and their potential role in the clinical setting. Despite progress, there remains significant opportunity to improve our understanding of the epidemiology of AKI recovery.

### A risk prediction score for acute kidney injury in the intensive care unit [^942825be]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in critically ill patients and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Early identification of high-risk patients provides an opportunity to develop strategies for prevention, early diagnosis and treatment of AKI.

Methods

We undertook this multicenter prospective cohort study to develop and validate a risk score for predicting AKI in patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). Patients were screened for predictor variables within 48h of ICU admission. Baseline and acute risk factors were recorded at the time of screening and serum creatinine was measured daily for up to 7 days. A risk score model for AKI was developed with multivariate regression analysis combining baseline and acute risk factors in the development cohort (573 patients) and the model was further evaluated on a test cohort (144 patients). Validation was performed on an independent prospective cohort of 1300 patients. The discriminative ability of the risk model was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and model calibration was evaluated by Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic. AKI was defined by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria (absolute change of 0.3mg/dL or relative change of 50% from baseline serum creatinine in 48h to 7 days, respectively).

Results

AKI developed in 754 (37.2%) patients. In the multivariate model, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension, atherosclerotic coronary vascular disease, pH ≤ 7.30, nephrotoxin exposure, sepsis, mechanical ventilation and anemia were identified as independent predictors of AKI and the AUROC for the model in the test cohort was 0.79 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70–0.89]. On the external validation cohort, the AUROC value was 0.81 (95% CI 0.78–0.83). The risk model demonstrated good calibration in both cohorts. Positive and negative predictive values for the optimal cutoff value of ≥ 5 points in test and validation cohorts were 22.7 and 96.1% and 31.8 and 95.4%, respectively.

Conclusions

A risk score model integrating chronic comorbidities and acute events at ICU admission can identify patients at high risk to develop AKI. This risk assessment tool could help clinicians to stratify patients for primary prevention, surveillance and early therapeutic intervention to improve care and outcomes of ICU patients.

### Acute kidney injury network: report of an initiative to improve outcomes in acute kidney injury [^164318db]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a complex disorder for which currently there is no accepted definition. Having a uniform standard for diagnosing and classifying AKI would enhance our ability to manage these patients. Future clinical and translational research in AKI will require collaborative networks of investigators drawn from various disciplines, dissemination of information via multidisciplinary joint conferences and publications, and improved translation of knowledge from pre-clinical research. We describe an initiative to develop uniform standards for defining and classifying AKI and to establish a forum for multidisciplinary interaction to improve care for patients with or at risk for AKI.

Methods

Members representing key societies in critical care and nephrology along with additional experts in adult and pediatric AKI participated in a two day conference in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, in September 2005 and were assigned to one of three workgroups. Each group's discussions formed the basis for draft recommendations that were later refined and improved during discussion with the larger group. Dissenting opinions were also noted. The final draft recommendations were circulated to all participants and subsequently agreed upon as the consensus recommendations for this report. Participating societies endorsed the recommendations and agreed to help disseminate the results.

Results

The term AKI is proposed to represent the entire spectrum of acute renal failure. Diagnostic criteria for AKI are proposed based on acute alterations in serum creatinine or urine output. A staging system for AKI which reflects quantitative changes in serum creatinine and urine output has been developed.

Conclusion

We describe the formation of a multidisciplinary collaborative network focused on AKI. We have proposed uniform standards for diagnosing and classifying AKI which will need to be validated in future studies. The Acute Kidney Injury Network offers a mechanism for proceeding with efforts to improve patient outcomes.

KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) — research recommendations state that the role of biomarkers other than SCr in the early diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and prognosis of AKI patients should be explored, including early detection where the gold standard is AKI by clinical diagnosis after the fact and the biomarker is compared to existing markers (SCr and urine output) at the time of presentation; prognosis where a biomarker is used to predict risk for AKI or risk for progression of AKI; and prognosis where a biomarker is used to predict recovery after AKI vs. death or need for long-term RRT. The influence of urinary output criteria on AKI staging needs to be further investigated, and influence of fluid balance, percent volume overload, diuretic use, and differing weights (actual, ideal body weight, lean body mass) should be considered; also, it is currently not known how urine volume criteria should be applied. The influence of whether SCr or eGFR criteria are used should be tested through simulation, and whether relative and absolute SCr increments or eGFR decrements at different time points and with differently ascertained baseline values requires further exploration and validation in various populations.

### The RIFLE and AKIN classifications for acute kidney injury: a critical and comprehensive review [^1dc2ca40]. Clinical Kidney Journal (2013). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "AKIN diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury" for acute kidney injury.

The AKIN (Acute Kidney Injury Network) classification for acute kidney injury is a diagnostic and severity grading system used in patients with suspected acute kidney injury (AKI). This calculator is applicable to all patient populations, including those in the intensive care unit, hospitalized patients, and outpatients.

The AKIN classification system is used to identify and stratify the severity of AKI based on changes in serum creatinine levels or urine output. It helps clinicians to determine the appropriate treatment strategies and predict patient outcomes.

The AKIN classification system is not suitable for patients with chronic kidney disease or those with pre-existing renal dysfunction, as the changes in serum creatinine levels or urine output may not accurately reflect the acute changes in kidney function in these patients.

The AKIN diagnostic criteria tool helps identify the severity of acute kidney injury (AKI) by evaluating changes in serum creatinine levels and urine output. The user starts by selecting one diagnostic criterion from a list of options, each reflecting different clinical measures.

These criteria include:

- Serum creatinine increase of at least 0.3 mg/dL (26.4 mcmol/L) or 1.5 to 2 times the baseline, with urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/hour lasting over 6 hours.
- Serum creatinine increase of more than 2 to 3 times from baseline, combined with urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/hour over a 12-hour period.
- Serum creatinine increase to or beyond 4 mg/dL (354 mcmol/L), with a rapid increment of at least 0.5 mg/dL (44 mcmol/L), or over 3 times the baseline value. This is associated with urine output below 0.3 mL/kg/hour for 24 hours, or complete lack of urine for 12 hours.

Using these criteria, the tool assigns an AKI stage:

- Stage 1 corresponds to the selection where serum creatinine increases are at least 0.3 mg/dL or 1.5–2 times above baseline paired with specified urine output reduction over 6 hours.
- Stage 2 signifies a creatinine increase of more than 2–3 times from baseline with decreased urine output extending past 12 hours.
- Stage 3 is indicated by the most severe changes in creatinine and urine output metrics, the latter showing significant reduction or lack of production over longer durations.

Each stage reflects increasing AKI severity, impacting clinical evaluation and management decisions. Recognizing the stage is critical for patient outcomes, steering appropriate interventions and monitoring.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^a6af8f3a]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 chronic kidney disease (CKD) chronicity assessment — differentiating CKD from acute kidney disorders emphasizes that the major challenge for defining chronicity is to differentiate CKD from acute kidney diseases (AKDs) such as acute glomerulonephritis (GN), including acute kidney injury (AKI), which may require different timelines for initiation of treatments, different interventions, and have different etiologies and outcomes. The duration of kidney disease may be documented or inferred based on the clinical context; for example, a person with decreased GFR or kidney damage during an acute illness, without prior documentation of kidney disease, may be inferred to have AKD, and resolution over days to weeks would confirm the diagnosis of AKI. A person with similar findings in the absence of an acute illness may be inferred to have CKD and, if followed over time, would be confirmed to have CKD. In both cases, repeat ascertainment of GFR and kidney damage is recommended for accurate diagnosis and staging, and the timing of the evaluation depends on clinical judgment, with earlier evaluation for those suspected of having AKI and later evaluation for those suspected of having CKD. For people with risk factors for CKD, delaying diagnosis for the sake of confirming chronicity can delay care, and initiating treatment both allows for earlier intervention and also indicates to people the importance of the disease.

### Acute kidney injury [^5ba54460]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2021). High credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined by a sudden loss of excretory kidney function. AKI is part of a range of conditions summarized as acute kidney diseases and disorders (AKD), in which slow deterioration of kidney function or persistent kidney dysfunction is associated with an irreversible loss of kidney cells and nephrons, which can lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD). New biomarkers to identify injury before function loss await clinical implementation. AKI and AKD are a global concern. In low-income and middle-income countries, infections and hypovolaemic shock are the predominant causes of AKI. In high-income countries, AKI mostly occurs in elderly patients who are in hospital, and is related to sepsis, drugs or invasive procedures. Infection and trauma-related AKI and AKD are frequent in all regions. The large spectrum of AKI implies diverse pathophysiological mechanisms. AKI management in critical care settings is challenging, including appropriate volume control, nephrotoxic drug management, and the timing and type of kidney support. Fluid and electrolyte management are essential. As AKI can be lethal, kidney replacement therapy is frequently required. AKI has a poor prognosis in critically ill patients. Long-term consequences of AKI and AKD include CKD and cardiovascular morbidity. Thus, prevention and early detection of AKI are essential.

### Reading between the (guide) lines – the KDIGO practice guideline on acute kidney injury in the individual patient [^bd7b6cfc]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

The KDIGO guidelines for acute kidney injury (AKI) are designed to assist health-care providers around the world in managing patients with AKI. Clinical guidelines are intended to help the clinician make an informed decision based on review of the currently available evidence. Due to the generic nature of guidelines, it is sometimes difficult to translate a guideline for a particular individual patient who may have specific clinical circumstances. To illustrate this point, we have discussed the interpretation of the KDIGO guideline in patients who have subtleties in their clinical presentation, which may make treatment decisions less than straightforward.

### Perioperative acute kidney injury: diagnosis, prediction, prevention, and treatment [^c3051194]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

In patients who progress to stage 2 AKI, adjusting drug dosages to account for glomerular filtration and careful attention to volume input or output become important. Stage 3 AKI is associated with acid–base imbalance, altered electrolyte levels, and accumulation of uremic toxins. Decisions on the need for intensive care and initiation of kidney replacement therapy require expertise in nephrology or critical care medicine and should be considered early in disease progression.

Phase of care, monitoring, and follow-up can vary greatly depending on the severity of disease. The KDIGO clinical practice guidelines recommend that all patients diagnosed with AKI are evaluated at 3 months to screen for new or progressive chronic kidney disease, while the Acute Disease Quality Initiative and PeriOperative Quality Initiative recommend all postoperative patients with AKI or acute kidney disease have a kidney health assessment within 30 days of hospital discharge. As morbidity and mortality increase with severity of AKI (and in patients without renal recovery), these factors should inform the frequency and nature of follow-up. Management of AKI during the period of inpatient hospitalization provides an opportunity to prevent or delay progression of AKI to chronic kidney disease. Patients requiring acute renal replacement therapy (or necessitate continuous renal replacement therapy due to hemodynamic instability) should be managed in the ICU. Furthermore, a variety of critical conditions associated with AKI including shock, sepsis, acid–base imbalance, and respiratory failure secondary to fluid overload require intensive care. The KDIGO management guidelines recommend considering ICU admission beginning at stage 2 AKI.

### Acute kidney injury: diagnosis and management [^0eadb61b]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury is a clinical syndrome characterized by a rapid decline in glomerular filtration rate and resultant accumulation of metabolic waste products. Acute kidney injury is associated with an increased risk of mortality, cardiovascular events, and progression to chronic kidney disease. Severity of acute kidney injury is classified according to urine output and elevations in creatinine level. Etiologies of acute kidney injury are categorized as prerenal, intrinsic renal, and postrenal. Accurate diagnosis of the underlying cause is key to successful management and includes a focused history and physical examination, serum and urine electrolyte measurements, and renal ultrasonography when risk factors for a postrenal cause are present (e.g., older male with prostatic hypertrophy). General management principles for acute kidney injury include determination of volume status, fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloid, treatment of volume overload with diuretics, discontinuation of nephrotoxic medications, and adjustment of prescribed drugs according to renal function. Additional supportive care measures may include optimizing nutritional status and glycemic control. Pharmacist-led quality-improvement programs reduce nephrotoxic exposures and rates of acute kidney injury in the hospital setting. Acute kidney injury care bundles are associated with improved in-hospital mortality rates and reduced risk of progression. Nephrology consultation should be considered when there is inadequate response to supportive treatment and for acute kidney injury without a clear cause, stage 3 or higher acute kidney injury, preexisting stage 4 or higher chronic kidney disease, renal replacement therapy, and other situations requiring subspecialist expertise.

### Before you call renal: acute kidney injury for hospitalists [^b9de0b19]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury is a clinical problem of growing incidence in hospitalized patients. It increases the risk of poor outcomes, length of stay and the cost of hospitalization. Successful management of acute kidney injury requires early recognition and diagnosis through detailed medical history, careful physical exam, judicious use of laboratory and radiologic tests and timely renal consultation. Subsequent management is tailored to the likely mechanism of injury with emphasis on limiting both further injury and systemic consequences. A common sense approach to acute kidney injury is essential for hospitalists aiming to limit further injury, prevent acute complications and lessen the risk of chronic morbidity.

### Assessment of the RIFLE criteria for the diagnosis of acute kidney injury; a retrospective study in south-Western Ghana [^4573a046]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is classically defined as an abrupt and sustained decrease in renal function. However, there is neither agreement on the best method of assessing renal function nor consensus on the exact cutoffs for the diagnosis of AKI. This challenge not only leads to conflicting reports in literature but is also believed to be a major obstacle to research in this field.

There are no reliable estimates of AKI incidence across Africa, however, recent studies from Uganda report an AKI prevalence of 16.3 among sepsis patients. But, findings from studies from other parts of the world indicate that AKI is common especially among hospitalized patients and affects some 3–7% of patients in hospitals and 25–30% of intensive care patients. AKI ultimately results in morbidity, or will consequently demand the use of renal replacement therapy procedures such as dialysis or will result in mortality.

AKI in sub Saharan-African countries including Ghana is mostly attributed to infections like HIV/AIDS, malaria, diarrhoeal diseases; nephrotoxins and obstetric and surgical complications. Also AKI in Ghana has been associated with the use poorly prepared herbal preparations. Consequently, the International Society of Nephrology (ISN) introduced the ISN 0 by 25 to reduce the occurrence and impact of AKI.

A standard way of diagnosing AKI has been introduced with the acute kidney injury network (AKIN), RIFLE, and the kidney disease improving global outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines to ensure effective diagnosis and proper management. The Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) formulated the Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage Kidney (RIFLE) classification for the diagnosis of acute kidney injury. RIFLE, an international consensus classification for acute kidney injury, defines three grades of severity — risk (class R), injury (class I), failure (class F) and two outcome classes (loss and end-stage kidney disease).

### Neonatal RIFLE [^8c295e92]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

A standardized classification of acute kidney injury (AKI) has recently been proposed with the RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of function, End-stage kidney disease) score. Such definition/classification has been applied both in adult and in paediatric patients. Neonatal definition of AKI likely results as a challenging task due to the peculiar renal pathophysiology of newborn critically ill patients. Their so-called 'immature kidneys' require careful management and neonatal AKI is frequently complicated by unfavourable outcomes. A recent attempt to implement the RIFLE score with a neonatal modification might lead to improvement on the knowledge of AKI incidence and epidemiology.

Nomenclature as a Function of Chronicity

When KDIGO AKI (stage 1 or greater) persists for more than 7 days after the inciting event, it is termed acute kidney disease. When the disease process persists beyond 90 days, it transitions from acute kidney disease to chronic kidney disease.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury is well recognized for its impact on the outcome of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Illness severity scores such as the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation version III (APACHE III) scoring system and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (SOFA) both weight kidney dysfunction heavily (20% and 16.6% of the total scores for acute physiology). Yet there is no consensus on the amount of dysfunction that defines acute kidney injury, with more than 30 definitions in use in the literature today. The variety of definitions used in clinical studies may be partly responsible for the large variations in the reported incidence (1–31%) and the associated mortality (19–83%) of acute kidney injury. Indeed, the lack of a uniform definition for acute kidney injury is believed to be a major impediment to research in the field. Acute kidney injury is generally defined as 'an abrupt and sustained decrease in kidney function'. Until recently there has not been a consensus on how best to assess kidney function; namely, what markers best reflect kidney function, and what values of those markers discriminate normal from abnormal kidney function.
