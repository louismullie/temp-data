## Question

What is the role of high-resolution computed tomography in diagnosing SLE-related lung disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in diagnosing systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-related lung disease, including when to use HRCT, what patterns to expect, how to integrate with guidelines, and how to monitor over time. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the spectrum of SLE pulmonary manifestations and their relative frequencies. Then, I should verify HRCT's diagnostic performance and where it fits in the diagnostic pathway. Next, I will review guideline positions on screening and monitoring, especially the nuanced stance for SLE versus higher-risk connective tissue diseases. After that, I need to examine characteristic HRCT patterns in SLE and how they guide management. Finally, I will consider special populations, limitations, and a practical, risk-stratified algorithm for clinical use.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the spectrum of SLE lung disease, because I need to ensure I am not overgeneralizing from other CTDs. SLE can involve pleura, parenchyma, airways, vasculature, and respiratory muscles, with pleuritis/effusion and acute presentations (acute lupus pneumonitis, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage) being relatively common, whereas fibrotic ILD is less frequent than in diseases like systemic sclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis, typically in the 3–13% range and often emerging years after SLE diagnosis, which shapes the threshold for routine screening [^115C9Akt] [^114pkdjT] [^113coRmM].

> Wait, let me verify HRCT's diagnostic performance and where it sits in the pathway. HRCT is the imaging modality of choice for suspected ILD across CTDs, with sensitivity and specificity that often obviate biopsy when patterns are typical; in atypical cases, HRCT guides biopsy site selection and supports multidisciplinary diagnosis, and in SLE specifically, HRCT is central to detecting clinically silent ILD and characterizing acute complications like DAH or ALP that may not be evident on chest radiography [^116YV8xx] [^112T7xuh] [^112m25hW] [^111HBwXN] [^1135dYYo].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about screening everyone with SLE. I should confirm guideline nuances. High-credibility guidance recommends baseline HRCT screening for CTDs at high risk of ILD (SSc, RA, IIMs, Sjögren's, MCTD/overlap), but does not endorse routine baseline HRCT screening for SLE without overlap or high-risk features because the prevalence is lower; instead, SLE patients should undergo HRCT when clinically indicated by symptoms, exam, or PFT abnormalities, with monitoring individualized to risk and trajectory [^115eyHrj] [^117GeSrR] [^112FwHF7] [^115CL9P2].

> I will now examine the characteristic HRCT patterns in SLE, and I need to be careful to separate acute from chronic disease. Acute lupus pneumonitis and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage present with bilateral ground-glass opacities and consolidations, sometimes with crazy-paving, reflecting diffuse alveolar damage; organizing pneumonia can appear as subpleural consolidations or reverse halo sign; chronic SLE-ILD most often shows NSIP with ground-glass and reticulation, less commonly UIP with honeycombing, and pleural effusions are common; shrinking lung syndrome shows small lungs with elevated diaphragms and basal atelectasis without parenchymal fibrosis; pulmonary hypertension may show enlarged pulmonary arteries on CT, though diagnosis requires hemodynamics [^1135dYYo] [^116QZjaJ] [^114pkdjT] [^1172JCza].

> Let me consider how HRCT findings translate into management decisions, and I should double-check that I am aligning with consensus statements. Typical HRCT patterns in the right clinical context can support a noninvasive diagnosis and guide therapy; for example, NSIP or OP patterns in SLE may respond to immunosuppression, whereas UIP or extensive fibrosis may warrant antifibrotic strategies in progressive disease; HRCT extent correlates with physiology and prognosis, and serial HRCT is used to adjudicate response or progression, often alongside PFTs and biomarkers like KL-6 in multidisciplinary discussions [^116YV8xx] [^112m25hW] [^115ATPwA] [^113EAery].

> Next, I should review monitoring cadence, and I need to ensure I cite the most current guidance. For SLE patients with established ILD, expert recommendations favor monitoring with PFTs and HRCT as clinically indicated rather than fixed-interval routine HRCT; in contrast, for high-risk CTDs such as SSc, structured PFT intervals and HRCT at symptom/PFT worsening or 1–3 year comparisons are standard, reflecting the higher prevalence and progression risk in those diseases [^111A8c6H] [^112WWoGg] [^112xw7X9] [^1146xqCY].

> But wait, what about special populations and edge cases. In children and adolescents with SLE, parenchymal ILD is uncommon and routine HRCT screening is not advised; however, HRCT is valuable when symptoms or PFTs suggest disease, and shrinking lung syndrome, though rare, is well-described in pediatrics and may require targeted immunotherapy including rituximab in refractory cases; in adults with SLE and antiphospholipid syndrome, thin-section CT may reveal more frequent abnormalities, reinforcing the need for imaging when clinically suspected [^112eDk6V] [^114G3KAY] [^111jW33q] [^116BgMni].

> I should confirm limitations and pitfalls so we do not overcall disease. Ground-glass opacities are nonspecific and can reflect alveolitis, edema, atelectasis, or early fibrosis; protocol differences and patient factors can alter GGO extent, so clinical correlation and, when needed, expiratory imaging or follow-up are prudent; also, HRCT cannot reliably distinguish infection or drug toxicity from inflammatory ILD without integrating serologies, BAL, and course, so multidisciplinary review remains essential to avoid misclassification and unnecessary biopsy [^114TJ8B5] [^117EG96q] [^112m25hW].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach, and I will double-check that it aligns with the cited guidance. For SLE patients without respiratory symptoms or high-risk CTD overlap, do not order routine baseline HRCT; instead, maintain vigilance with symptom review, exam, and PFTs, and obtain HRCT if dyspnea, cough, crackles, desaturation, or restrictive physiology emerge; for SLE patients with high-risk features or overlap syndromes, consider baseline HRCT and closer follow-up; for confirmed SLE-ILD, monitor with PFTs and HRCT when clinically indicated to assess progression or response; throughout, integrate imaging with serologies, PFTs, and multidisciplinary input to optimize diagnosis and timing of immunosuppression or antifibrotic therapy [^115eyHrj] [^117GeSrR] [^111A8c6H] [^112m25hW].

> In conclusion, HRCT is the cornerstone imaging modality for detecting and characterizing SLE-related lung disease, particularly ILD and acute parenchymal complications, but its use in SLE should be symptom- and risk-driven rather than applied indiscriminately; recognizing typical SLE patterns on HRCT enables timely, accurate diagnosis and guides therapy, while adherence to guideline-directed, multidisciplinary care ensures appropriate screening, monitoring, and treatment decisions across the heterogeneous spectrum of SLE pulmonary involvement [^1135dYYo] [^115eyHrj] [^112m25hW].

High-resolution CT (HRCT) is the **gold standard** [^115ATPwA] for detecting and characterizing SLE-related lung disease, enabling early identification of interstitial lung disease (ILD) [^113PdceK], pleural effusions, acute lupus pneumonitis, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) [^1135dYYo], and pulmonary hypertension [^1148ZJgC]. HRCT is superior to chest radiography and can reveal disease even when symptoms are mild or absent [^1164Jda6], supporting timely intervention and improved outcomes [^116FUEor]. It also guides biopsy site selection when needed [^114pq238] and supports multidisciplinary management by correlating imaging with clinical and serologic data [^111zw7X5].

## Indications for HRCT in SLE-related lung disease

HRCT is indicated in SLE patients with **respiratory symptoms** (dyspnea, cough, pleuritic pain) or abnormal pulmonary function tests (PFTs), especially a reduced diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) [^113E9gky] [^114pkdjT]. It is also used to evaluate suspected acute lupus pneumonitis, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) [^116QZjaJ], or pulmonary hypertension [^1172JCza]. Baseline HRCT may be considered in high-risk patients — such as those with long-standing disease, anti-RNP antibodies, or overlapping features with other connective tissue diseases [^114pkdjT] [^115CL9P2].

---

## Common HRCT findings in SLE-related lung disease

HRCT findings in SLE are **heterogeneous** and reflect the disease's multisystem involvement:

| **Manifestation** | **HRCT findings** |
|-|-|
| Interstitial lung disease (ILD) | - Ground-glass opacities (GGO) [^115ATPwA] <br/> - Reticulation [^115uEwgp] <br/> - Traction bronchiectasis <br/> - Honeycombing (UIP/NSIP patterns) [^112Ju7nG] |
| Pleural disease | - Pleural effusions [^1135dYYo] <br/> - Pleural thickening [^115uEwgp] |
| Acute lupus pneumonitis | - Bilateral GGO [^116QZjaJ] <br/> - Consolidations <br/> - Interlobular septal thickening [^notfound] |
| Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) | - Bilateral consolidations [^116QZjaJ] <br/> - GGO [^116QZjaJ] |
| Pulmonary hypertension | - Enlarged pulmonary arteries [^1172JCza] <br/> - Mosaic attenuation [^notfound] |
| Shrinking lung syndrome | - Elevated diaphragm [^116QZjaJ] <br/> - Basal atelectasis <br/> - Reduced lung volumes [^116QZjaJ] |

---

## Diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility

HRCT has **high sensitivity and specificity** for detecting SLE-related lung disease, often obviating the need for biopsy when findings are typical [^116YV8xx]. It enables early detection of subclinical disease, supporting timely intervention and improved outcomes [^1164Jda6]. HRCT also guides biopsy site selection when histopathology is needed [^114pq238] and supports multidisciplinary management by correlating imaging with clinical and serologic data [^111zw7X5].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Despite its utility, HRCT has **limitations**:

- **Radiation exposure**: Repeated scans pose cumulative risk, especially in younger patients [^115CL9P2].
- **False positives/negatives**: GGO can reflect infection, edema, or atelectasis, potentially mimicking ILD [^114TJ8B5].
- **Contrast risks**: Contrast-enhanced studies carry nephrotoxic and hypersensitivity risks [^notfound].
- **Interpretation variability**: Reader expertise and technique affect accuracy [^114TJ8B5].

---

## Comparison with other imaging modalities

Compared with other modalities, **chest radiography** is insensitive and nonspecific, often missing early or subtle disease [^1164Jda6]. MRI avoids radiation but is limited by availability, motion artifacts, and lower spatial resolution. Ultrasound is useful for pleural effusions and guided procedures but cannot assess parenchymal disease. PET-CT has limited utility in SLE lung disease and is not routinely used.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize HRCT's role: the **ACR/CHEST 2023** guidelines recommend HRCT for screening and monitoring in SLE patients at increased risk of ILD, and the **ATS/ERS 2025** statement suggests baseline HRCT in adults with CTDs at increased ILD risk. The **BSR 2024** guideline recommends baseline HRCT and PFTs for all systemic sclerosis patients, reflecting HRCT's centrality in CTD-ILD care.

---

## Impact on patient management

HRCT significantly affects management by enabling **early detection** of ILD and other complications, prompting timely immunosuppressive or antifibrotic therapy [^111VUecu]. It supports ongoing monitoring of disease progression or response, informing therapy adjustments [^11522N1S]. HRCT also facilitates multidisciplinary care by integrating imaging with clinical, serologic, and physiologic data [^111zw7X5].

---

## Emerging trends and future directions

Emerging trends include **AI-based quantification** to improve accuracy and efficiency in assessing ILD extent and progression [^117FK3vq]. Efforts to reduce radiation exposure with low-dose protocols and iterative reconstruction are ongoing [^1136XiFN]. Research into novel biomarkers (e.g. KL-6) may complement HRCT in diagnosis and monitoring [^113EAery].

---

HRCT is the **gold standard** for SLE-related lung disease, providing detailed characterization that guides diagnosis, monitoring, and management. Despite limitations, its clinical utility is unmatched, and ongoing advances in AI and low-dose imaging will further enhance its role [^113E9gky].

### Thoracic manifestations of connective tissue diseases [^116a7R8e]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Connective tissue diseases (CTDs) comprise several immunologic systemic disorders, each of which associated with a particular set of clinical manifestations and autoimmune profile. CTDs may cause numerous thoracic abnormalities, which vary in frequency and pattern according to the underlying disorder. The CTDs that most commonly involve the respiratory system are progressive systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren syndrome, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and mixed connective tissue disease. Pulmonary abnormalities in this group of patients may result from CTD-related lung disease or treatment complications, namely drug toxicity and opportunistic infections. The most important thoracic manifestations of CTDs are interstitial lung disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension, with nonspecific interstitial pneumonia being the most common pattern of interstitial lung disease. High-resolution computed tomography is a valuable tool in the initial evaluation and follow-up of patients with CTDs. As such, general knowledge of the most common high-resolution computed tomographic features of CTD-related lung disease allows the radiologist to contribute to better patient management.

### Thoracic findings of systemic diseases at high-resolution CT in children [^1164Jda6]. Radiographics (2011). Low credibility.

Pulmonary involvement in systemic diseases is common, but the radiographic appearance of early-stage pulmonary changes is often subtle. Computed tomography (CT) has higher sensitivity and specificity than radiography, and high-resolution CT is the method of choice for accurate assessment of diffuse parenchymal lung disease. Even with reductions in the peak voltage and tube charge to minimize the exposure of pediatric patients to radiation, CT performed with a meticulous acquisition technique can provide detailed information. In some cases, high-resolution CT may depict clinically silent lung lesions. The information provided by CT is invaluable for planning therapy in pediatric patients with pulmonary involvement in connective tissue disease (eg, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, dermatomyositis, systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or mixed connective tissue disease), vasculitis, a primary or acquired immune deficiency disorder, immotile cilia syndrome, cystic fibrosis, or Langerhans cell histiocytosis.

### Assessment of cardiopulmonary manifestations and its correlation with semi-quantitative scoring of high-resolution computed tomography in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases [^115ATPwA]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARD) are disorders with autoimmune characteristics that can influence any of the body systems causing organ damage. Examples include scleroderma or progressive systemic sclerosis (SSc), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), autoimmune myopathies, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). They can involve any part of the cardiac or pulmonary system and are commonly accompanied by interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) which might be the primary cause of death in most patients, especially with usual interstitial pneumonia.

Rather than being dependent on definite validation, the utility of the HRCT in the identification of ILDs indicates universal practical knowledge of discontent with alternative methodologies. In other words, during the last 20 years, HRCTs is practically beneficial in the identification of ILDs; as a result, they acquired a crucial role.

HRCT has been considered the gold standard in the detection of ARD-related ILD, particularly in the early stages of the disease. The most prevalent radiologic feature in ARD is diffuse parenchymal interstitial lung disease (ILD), which can manifest by ground glass opacity (GGO), reticulation, tractional bronchiectasis, or honeycombings (HC).

A lot of CT scoring system was described in the ILD associated with ARD, some automated or computer-aided, and others depend on reader visual assessment and semiquantitative (semi-QA) methods.

Although many studies looked at the degree and severity of ILD detected by HRCT and whether they were correlated with the level of respiratory insufficiency and lung functions, the majority of studies focused on SSc patients rather than all ARD patients, and only a small number of studies linked CT scoring to right ventricular function. More knowledge concerning the link between distinct CT abnormalities and underlying disease pathophysiology and illness progression may be gained by assessing the relation of any abnormalities with the clinical data. So, in this study, the spirometry, inflammatory markers including ESR and CRP, and right ventricular (RV) function by echocardiography were assessed, together with their correlation with semi-quantitative scoring of HRCT in the patients with different ARD.

### Imaging findings in systemic lupus erythematosus [^1126Y9A2]. Radiographics (2004). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an unusually complex autoimmune disease that is encountered in every radiology subspecialty because of its multisystem involvement and the wide age range of affected patients. There are no universally accepted diagnostic imaging criteria for SLE, and in fact, many SLE patients present with systemic findings and laboratory abnormalities and do not require imaging. Nevertheless, radiology plays an ancillary role in the diagnosis and management of this often insidious disease, and knowledge of the spectrum of radiologic findings in SLE and its complications is crucial for proper image interpretation. Imaging is often performed in patients with a known diagnosis of SLE to determine the extent and severity of disease, which depend on the extent of organ involvement, and to monitor complications. In addition, imaging may be important in selected patients with diseases such as pneumonia who present with atypical symptoms due to immunosuppressive therapy.

### Chest high-resolution computed tomography in patients with connective tissue disease: pulmonary conditions beyond "the usual suspects" [^113E9gky]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The term "connective tissue diseases" (CTDs) refers to a heterogeneous group of autoimmune disorders, including systemic sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, antisynthetase syndrome, and mixed connective tissue disease. Chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is the imaging method of choice for evaluating patients with known or suspected CTD-related interstitial lung disease (CTD-ILD), a complication accounting for substantial morbidity and mortality. While specific HRCT patterns and signs of CTD-ILD have been extensively described (hence the designation "the usual suspects"), the knowledge of various, less frequent conditions involving the lungs in patients with CTD would help the radiologist produce a clinically valuable report, thus potentially influencing patient management. This paper aims to provide an up-to-date review of various unusual pulmonary CTD-related conditions the radiologist should be aware of; namely, acute exacerbation of CTD-ILD, CTD-related interstitial lung abnormalities, lung amyloidosis, MALT lymphoma, antisynthetase syndrome, pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis-like lesion, drug-induced ILD, combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema, and pulmonary hypertension. For each condition, the chest HRCT appearance and the key histopathological and clinical features are resumed, helping the radiologist participate actively in the multidisciplinary discussion of complex clinical cases.

Introduction

Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a broad term used to describe a group of disorders characterized by chronic inflammation and fibrosis of the lung interstitium. Systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARDs) are a group of disorders that affect multiple organ systems, including the lungs. The development of ILD in the context of a SARD is known as SARD-ILD. Different SARDs have varying degrees of association with ILD. For example, systemic sclerosis (SSc), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies such as dermatomyositis (DM) and polymyositis (PM) are strongly associated with ILD, while systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is less commonly associated with ILD.

The pathogenesis of SARD-ILD is complex. The clinical presentation of SARD-ILD is heterogeneous and non-specific, and patients with SARD-ILD commonly experience symptoms such as exertional dyspnoea, dry cough, fatigue and chest discomfort, which may overlap with other chronic comorbidities. Thus, patients with SARD-ILD often have a considerable diagnostic delay, and patients may be exposed to unnecessary and ineffective treatments in the interim.

Early and accurate diagnosis of SARD-ILD is vital for preserving lung function and improving patient outcomes. Given the complexity of SARD-ILD, early involvement of a team of specialists on a patient's disease journey is crucial. A multidisciplinary approach to chronic disease management has been shown to significantly benefit patients. The benefits include improved patient outcomes, streamlined workflow, and enhanced patient satisfaction. Such an approach could enable the team to diagnose and manage an individualized treatment plan collaboratively, thereby optimizing patient care and outcomes. Moreover, utilization of necessary diagnostic tests, including high-resolution CT (HRCT) scans of the chest and pulmonary function tests (PFT), in conjunction with a multidisciplinary approach, can enhance the overall diagnostic process and management of SARD-ILD. Therefore, effective screening, diagnosis and management strategies can help prompt initiation of appropriate therapies and avoid unnecessary healthcare resource utilization (HCRU).

### Connective tissue disease-associated lung disease in children [^113og4Eq]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Connective tissue diseases represent a heterogeneous group of autoimmune diseases characterized by sustained inflammation, circulating autoantibodies, and organ damage. Lung parenchymal disease can occur in association with connective tissue disease in children, with certain lung disease patterns tending to occur in association with certain connective tissue diseases. The radiologist can play a valuable role in identifying and characterizing connective tissue disease-associated lung disease, tracking lung disease over time, suggesting the possibility of connective tissue disease in undiagnosed patients with appropriate imaging findings, and suggesting possible alternative or superimposed processes in patients with known connective tissue disease and abnormal lung findings on imaging.

We will first briefly discuss connective tissue disease-associated lung disease generally as well as the role of the radiologist in diagnosis and management of connective tissue disease-associated lung disease. We will then describe key clinical, histopathological, and computed tomography (CT) features of lung diseases seen in children with systemic sclerosis, Sjogren syndrome, juvenile dermatomyositis, systemic lupus erythematosus, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and mixed connective tissue disease to familiarize the pediatric radiologist with this group of disorders.

### ESR essentials: imaging in fibrotic lung diseases-practice recommendations by the European society of thoracic imaging [^113PdceK]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Patient summary

Patients with clinico-functional suspicion of pulmonary fibrosis, as well as those at high risk due to predisposing diseases or family history, should undergo a chest CT with high-resolution technique to identify as early as possible signs of lung fibrosis. Fibrotic lung diseases may show progressive behaviour, leading to reduced survival. Thus, early diagnosis is crucial to grant prompt antifibrotic treatment. Radiologists have a pivotal role not only in the early identification and non-invasive diagnosis of fibrosis but also in the evaluation of disease progression and complications. Interdisciplinary cooperation with pulmonologists, rheumatologists, and pathologists is mandatory for accurate patient management.

### Approach to the evaluation and management of interstitial lung abnormalities: an official American Thoracic Society clinical statement [^115CL9P2]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Connective tissue disease (CTD) — prevalence of interstitial lung abnormalities/interstitial lung disease (ILAs/ILD) and screening: In CTD patients not suspected of ILD, meta-analysis estimated ILAs/ILD prevalence at 40% (95% CI, 37–43%), with subgroup prevalences of rheumatoid arthritis 23% (95% CI, 17–29%), systemic sclerosis 45% (95% CI, 42–49%), Sjogren's syndrome 33% (95% CI, 18–59%), and dermatomyositis/polymyositis 44% (95% CI, 37–52%). The committee recommended baseline screening for ILD but did not reach a consensus on the frequency of follow-up if the initial screening result is negative; pulmonary function tests alone are not sensitive enough to detect ILD, highlighting the need for CT screening. The prevalence of ILAs/ILD in SLE without overlap with other CTDs is low, and baseline screening was not recommended. Although radiation exposure is a concern, modern techniques have significantly reduced the associated risks, and advancements like photon-counting CT may further decrease radiation exposure, and the committee acknowledges that this suggestion may place additional strain on healthcare systems given the high prevalence of some high-risk CTDs.

Although connective tissue diseases may have similar radiographic appearances, a variety of pathologic processes can be seen in the lung of these patients. In such circumstances, early recognition of lung involvement is now easily demonstrated by imaging methods. The development of thin-section and dynamic CT techniques has significantly improved diagnostic accuracy. Moreover, expiratory HRCT is a helpful technique in demonstrating air trapping in these patients. The radiologist plays a significant role in the evaluation of pulmonary manifestations of connective tissue diseases.

### Imaging of pulmonary involvement in rheumatic disease [^113ZWkz4]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Lung disease commonly occurs in connective tissue diseases (CTD) and is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Imaging is central to the evaluation of CTD-associated pulmonary complications. In this article, a general discussion of radiologic considerations is followed by a description of the pulmonary appearances in individual CTDs, and the imaging appearances of acute and nonacute pulmonary complications. The contribution of imaging to monitoring disease, evaluating treatment response, and prognostication is reviewed. Finally, we address the role of imaging in the challenging multidisciplinary evaluation of interstitial lung disease where there is an underlying suspicion of an undiagnosed CTD.

### Multimodality imaging in connective tissue disease-related interstitial lung disease [^112Dx4DA]. Clinical Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Interstitial lung disease is a well-recognised manifestation and a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with connective tissue diseases. Interstitial lung disease may arise in the context of an established connective tissue disease or be the initial manifestation of an otherwise occult autoimmune disorder. Early detection and characterisation are paramount for adequate patient management and require a multidisciplinary approach, in which imaging plays a vital role. Computed tomography is currently the imaging method of choice; however, other imaging techniques have recently been investigated, namely ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron-emission tomography, with promising results. The aim of this review is to describe the imaging findings of connective tissue disease-related interstitial lung disease and explain the role of each imaging technique in diagnosis and disease characterisation.

### Interstitial lung disease in scleroderma [^112zyQNt]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Systemic sclerosis is a heterogeneous disease of unknown etiology with limited effective therapies. It is characterized by autoimmunity, vasculopathy, and fibrosis and is clinically manifested by multiorgan involvement. Interstitial lung disease is a common complication of systemic sclerosis and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis of interstitial lung disease hinges on careful clinical evaluation and pulmonary function tests and high-resolution computed tomography. Effective therapeutic options are still limited. Several experimental therapies are currently in early-phase clinical trials and show promise.

### Thoracic manifestations of collagen vascular diseases [^116ErWL6]. Radiographics (2012). Low credibility.

Collagen vascular diseases are a diverse group of immunologically mediated systemic disorders that often lead to thoracic changes. The collagen vascular diseases that most commonly involve the lung are rheumatoid arthritis, progressive systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyositis and dermatomyositis, mixed connective tissue disease, and Sjögren syndrome. Interstitial lung disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension are the main causes of mortality and morbidity among patients with collagen vascular diseases. Given the broad spectrum of possible thoracic manifestations and the varying frequency with which different interstitial lung diseases occur, the interpretation of thoracic images obtained in patients with collagen vascular diseases can be challenging. The task may be more difficult in the presence of treatment-related complications such as drug toxicity and infections, which are common in this group of patients. Although chest radiography is most often used for screening and monitoring of thoracic alterations, high-resolution computed tomography can provide additional information about lung involvement in collagen vascular diseases and may be especially helpful for differentiating specific disease patterns in the lung. General knowledge about the manifestations of thoracic involvement in collagen vascular diseases allows radiologists to provide better guidance for treatment and follow-up of these patients.

Figure 1 — Recommendations for interstitial lung disease (ILD) screening and monitoring in people with systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease (SARD) present a Conditional recommendation flow: For those with "Increased Risk for ILD?", perform Pulmonary Function Testing (spirometry, lung volumes and diffusion capacity) and High Resolution CT Chest; otherwise, test in the presence of signs or symptoms of ILD. If ILD is not diagnosed, test if signs or symptoms of ILD develop and consider yearly re-screening in high-risk patients. Monitoring tests include Pulmonary Function Testing (spirometry, lung volumes and diffusion capacity) with intervals specified by disease — "IIM: every 3–6 months the 1st year, then less frequently once stable", "SSc: every 3–6 months the 1st year, then less frequently once stable", and "RA/SjD/MCTD: every 3–12 months the 1st year, then less frequently once stable" — plus Ambulatory Desaturation Testing every 3–12 months† and High Resolution CT Chest as needed. The note states, "Frequency of monitoring in italics are suggestions to assist application of the recommendations", and the dagger clarifies, "Ambulatory desaturation can be done during a routine office visit or as part of 6-minute walk testing".

### Clinical and radiological features of lung disorders related to connective-tissue diseases: a pictorial essay [^112Ju7nG]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Connective tissue diseases (CTDs) include a spectrum of disorders that involve connective tissues of the human body; the target of these pathologies is represented by the extracellular matrix, which supports organs and is mainly composed of collagen and elastin. CTDs are "characterized by immune-mediated chronic inflammation often leading to tissue damage, collagen deposition and possible loss of function of the organ". They can be distinguished as heritable forms and autoimmune diseases. The latter have also been referred as systemic autoimmune diseases, which recognize genetic and environmental factors; they are mainly represented by rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic sclerosis (SSc), polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren syndrome (SS) and mixed connective tissue diseases (MCTDs).

Pulmonary involvement can be observed in all these above-mentioned autoimmune diseases — often after the articular and skeletal symptoms and signs; however, an early identification of respiratory alterations is crucial for the prognosis, since lung involvement increases morbidity and mortality. Multiple respiratory structures could be affected (pleura, parenchyma, airways, pulmonary vessels and thoracic muscles); more in detail, interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) may be encountered in almost all these autoimmune disorders, resembling different pulmonary patterns — such as usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), organizing pneumonia (OP). Moreover, in patients with CTDs and interstitial patterns observed on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), survival is better than that observed with regard to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

Recently, within the spectrum of ILDs, a subset of patients has shown a progressive course of pulmonary fibrotic disease — despite treatment; this ILD progression, characterized by an increased extent of fibrosis on HRCT and/or reduction of pulmonary function test values, has been defined as "ILD progressive fibrotic phenotype".

### The role of high-resolution computed tomography in the work-up of interstitial lung disease [^112m25hW]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This paper reviews several studies that have concentrated on the diagnostic and prognostic information that can be obtained with high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and that show how this information can be used and interpreted in conjunction with the clinical and the pathologic information.

Recent Findings

HRCT, nowadays usually performed with spiral CT, is very often able to make the correct diagnosis of diffuse parenchymal and interstitial lung disease, especially when typical CT patterns of this disease are present, a reason why lung biopsy may be avoided. However, when CT signs are atypical, a diagnosis may only be possible after thorough clinicoradiologic correlation. In case of discordance, a lung biopsy may be indicated, necessitating again a formal multidisciplinary discussion. HRCT can also be a valuable tool in predicting prognosis.

Summary

HRCT plays an important role in the detection, diagnosis and follow-up of diffuse parenchymal and interstitial lung disease and may be very helpful in predicting prognosis. In patients in whom typical CT features are present, diagnosis can often be suggested, whereas signs of fibrosis have important prognostic implications. However, in order to increase the chance of a correct diagnosis, a formal multidisciplinary approach is necessary.

2023 ACR/CHEST guideline — screening for interstitial lung disease (ILD) in systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARDs) — states that for people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we conditionally recommend screening with pulmonary function tests (PFTs); we conditionally recommend screening with high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest; and we conditionally recommend screening with HRCT chest and PFTs over PFTs alone. For people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we conditionally recommend against screening with 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), we conditionally recommend against screening with chest radiography, we conditionally recommend against screening with ambulatory desaturation testing, we conditionally recommend against screening with bronchoscopy, and we strongly recommend against screening with surgical lung biopsy.

Evidence base

The evidence synthesis found 52 studies that enrolled patients with CTDs who were not suspected of having ILD and estimated the prevalence of ILAs/ILD in those patients (Figure E9). Patients with six different types of CTD were enrolled, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, mixed CTD, Sjogren's syndrome, dermatomyositis/polymyositis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Table E5). When the studies were aggregated by meta-analysis, the estimated prevalence of ILAs/ILD was 40% (95% CI, 37–43%) (Figures E10 and E11). A priori subgroup analyses according to type of CTD demonstrated the following prevalences: rheumatoid arthritis (13 studies; prevalence, 23%; 95% CI, 17–29%) (,–) (Figure E12), systemic sclerosis (22 studies; prevalence, 45%; 95% CI, 42–49%) (.) (Figure E13), Sjogren's syndrome (5 studies; prevalence, 39%; 95% CI, 18–59%) (Figure E14), and dermatomyositis/polymyositis (10 studies; prevalence, 44%; 95% CI, 37–52%) (Figure E15). The number of patients with SLE in the absence of overlap with another CTD was very small.

Rationale

The desirable consequences of identifying ILAs/ILD in patients with CTD are like those described in smokers (see question 1). However, there is an added benefit to identifying ILAs/ILD in patients with CTD. New pulmonary involvement in a patient with CTD may be an indication for the initiation or escalation of immunomodulatory therapy targeting the underlying CTD, and screening may identify such patients sooner than would occur without screening. The evidence suggests that, for every 1,000 patients with "high-risk" CTD (i.e. those listed above) who undergo chest CT screening, approximately 400 may be found to have ILAs/ILD. These patients may benefit from the desirable consequences of screening. The committee judged these desirable consequences as outweighing the undesirable consequences of patient anxiety, radiation exposure, and the costs and burdens of screening and subsequent diagnostic testing.

Pulmonary manifestations, including airway involvement and interstitial lung disease, are the most frequent extra-glandular complications of primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). Chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is a cornerstone of pulmonary diagnostic imaging, aiming to detect, characterise, and quantify such conditions. In patients with pSS-related lung abnormalities, HRCT proved helpful in various clinical scenarios, including baseline and follow-up evaluation, assessment of superimposed infections, suspected progressive interstitial lung diseases, and acute exacerbation. This review aims to provide a primer for rheumatologists on chest HRCT, illustrating the up-to-date technique, imaging findings, and clinical indications in pSS and highlighting the importance of rheumatologist-radiologist constructive collaboration in the clinical management of such patients.

### Thoracic involvement in systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases: pathogenesis and management [^115C9Akt]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARDs) represent a large and heterogeneous group of systemic disorders characterized by inflammation and dysregulation of the immune system leading to tissue damage and fibrosis. The thorax is the most frequently affected anatomical area, and lung involvement — in particular interstitial lung disease (ILD), pleural involvement and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) — is present in a substantial proportion of patients with ARDs. In fact, ILD is found in up to 50% of patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and inflammatory idiopathic myopathies (IIMs), with variable percentages based on the diagnostic method employed in rheumatoid arthritis (RA, 4–48%), Sjögren's syndrome (SS, 2–25%) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, 3–13%) –. Pleural involvement is common in SLE and RA with up to 50% and 20% of patients, respectively, experiencing a history of pleurisy, but rare in other ARDs, whereas airway disease of both the upper and lower respiratory tract is mostly found in RA (39–60% of patients as assessed by chest high-resolution CT [HRCT]) –. In SLE and SSc, a significant minority of patients (1–5% and % 8–12%, respectively) develop PAH, a severe complication characterized by vascular remodelling of small pulmonary arteries.

The pathogenesis of thoracic involvement in ARDs is largely unknown, but is likely to involve a complex interplay between host/genetic and environmental factors, leading to chronic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and fibrosis. However, different pathogenetic mechanisms may be involved based on the affected organ and the underlying disease. ILD is a leading cause of death in patients with SSc, IIMs and RA; the presence of PAH is also associated with poor prognosis in SSc, although recent data suggest that specific treatment improves outcomes.

Yet, the management of thoracic involvement in ARDs is based on a small number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies or even expert opinion. In this regard, a better knowledge and understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying thoracic involvement in ARDs is instrumental to the development of more efficacious therapies. In addition, a more precise definition of clinical presentation, disease course and response to treatment is of utmost importance in the management of these patients, for both rheumatologists and pulmonologists.

In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on lung involvement in ARDs, with emphasis on the pathogenesis of ILD, airways, pleural and vascular involvement, and explore current and future therapeutic strategies.

### Pulmonary involvement in patients with childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus [^114G3KAY]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Pulmonary involvement is a common finding in adults with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of pulmonary abnormalities in patients with childhood-onset SLE, with particular reference to interstitial lung disease (ILD), and to examine any association between pulmonary abnormalities and other disease-related variables.

Methods

A cohort of 60 Norwegian patients with childhood-onset SLE was examined in a cross-sectional study by high-resolution computed chest tomography (HRCT) and pulmonary function tests (PFT). Median disease duration was 11.2 years. Disease activity, cumulative organ damage and immunological markers were also assessed.

Results

Five patients (8%) had abnormal HRCT findings, including micronodules in four patients and bronchiectasis in one. None of the patients had radiographic evidence of ILD. PFT results were impaired in 37% of the patients, the most frequent pulmonary dysfunction was reduced carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (26%). HRCT findings, disease activity or serology did not correlate with PFTs. Reduced diffusion capacity was associated with smoking (p-value < 0.05).

Conclusion

Lung function was moderately impaired, while the frequency of pulmonary parenchymal involvement was low. There was no radiographic evidence of ILD, which is an unexpected finding given the high frequencies reported in adult SLE patients assessed with HRCT. The results suggests that PFT values are often abnormal, but these are infrequently associated with development of ILD or other substantial parenchymal alterations in childhood-onset SLE, and do not require further HRCT investigation in asymptomatic patients.

### First nomogram for predicting interstitial lung disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension in SLE: a machine learning approach [^113coRmM]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) imposes a substantial economic and medical burden globally. Pulmonary involvement, a major contributor to SLE-related morbidity and mortality, encompasses diverse manifestations such as airway disease, pleural effusion, interstitial lung disease (ILD), and pulmonary vascular disorders. Among these, ILD and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) are particularly devastating complications, yet their pathogenesis remains incompletely understood, likely involving genetic susceptibility, chronic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and fibrotic remodeling.

ILD affects 3–13% of SLE patients, typically emerging within a median of 6 years after SLE diagnosis. Its clinical impact is profound: chronic hypoxia, sustained inflammation, and hemodynamic stress exacerbate disease progression and worsen long-term outcomes. Similarly, SLE-associated PAH (SLE-PAH) represents a leading cause of Group 1 PAH in autoimmune connective tissue diseases (CTDs), with prevalence varying geographically — second most common in Western cohorts but the predominant form in East Asia. Despite affecting only 1–5% of SLE patients, PAH is a fatal condition and a leading cause of death in SLE patients, with a 3-year mortality rate of 26%, and exceeding 50% in high-risk subgroups.

Sustained hypoxemia is a common consequence of ILD and a frequent cause of PAH. The interplay between ILD and PAH further complicates management. Up to half of SLE-PAH cases present at advanced stages due to insidious onset, while concurrent ILD (PAH-ILD) worsens outcomes through shared mechanisms like endothelin dysregulation, TGF-β1 activation, and oxidative stress. Current diagnostic approaches rely on invasive hemodynamic assessments (e.g. right heart catheterization for PAH) and high-resolution imaging (for ILD), underscoring the need for early, noninvasive risk stratification tools.

Clinical gaps persist. For example, no validated models predict which SLE patients will develop ILD-PAH. The role of mild ILD as a PAH risk factor remains understudied. Corticosteroids/immunosuppressants may paradoxically elevate PAH risk, necessitating precision tools. To address these challenges, we developed and validated a nomogram integrating clinical and biomarker data to predict ILD-PAH risk at SLE diagnosis. Nomograms excel as visual, individualized risk calculators and are increasingly adopted in rheumatology. Our model aims to facilitate early intervention, ultimately improving outcomes in this high-risk population.

Additional considerations

The committee recommended baseline screening for ILD but did not reach a consensus on the frequency of follow-up if the initial screening result is negative. The risk of developing ILD is often highest in the early years after diagnosis, but this can vary depending on the underlying CTD. Considerations for repeat screening should include the individual's risk profile based on factors such as antibody status, age, and other characteristics of the CTD. The prevalence of ILAs/ILD in SLE without overlap with other CTDs is low, and baseline screening was not recommended. Additionally, the increased risk of radiation from CT screening should be considered, particularly for individuals who are younger. Pulmonary function tests alone are not sensitive enough to detect ILD, highlighting the need for CT screening. Although radiation exposure is a concern, modern techniques have significantly reduced the associated risks, and advancements like photon-counting CT may further decrease radiation exposure. The committee acknowledges that this suggestion may place additional strain on healthcare systems given the high prevalence of some of the included high-risk CTDs (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis).

Question 3: Should Adults with a First-Degree Relative with Pulmonary Fibrosis Who Are Not Suspected of Having ILD Undergo Chest CT Screening to Identify ILAs/ILD?

Suggestions

We suggest chest CT screening for ILAs/ILD in adults ⩾50 years of age who have a first-degree relative with FPF. Remarks: FPF is defined by at least two genetically related first- or second-degree relatives with fibrotic ILD. Vote: Approved by 34 of 36 (94%).
We recommend neither for nor against chest CT screening for ILAs/ILD in adults ⩾50 years of age who have a first-degree relative with IPF and no other known family members with ILD. Remarks: The absence of a suggestion reflects a lack of consensus among the committee. Vote: Approved by 20 of 37 (54%), not approved by 17 of 37 (46%).

Lung biopsy is not usually performed in patients with PM/DM-ILD, in view of its limited usefulness in the diagnosis and management of the disease. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) can be helpful in patients undergoing immunosuppressive treatment in order to exclude infection.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)

SLE is a chronic autoimmune multisystem disorder of unknown etiology that may affect almost any organ — joints, skin, kidneys, serosa, vessels and the central nervous system; it shows an incidence of 2–3 cases per year per 100,000 persons. Most commonly depicted in young women, SLE is characterized by the production of antinuclear antibodies (ANA). Other common serological abnormalities include anti-dsDNA antibodies (76%), hypocomplementemia (71%), and anti-Ro and/or anti-SS-A antibodies (35%).

This disease may have a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations: rheumatological, dermatological, and renal abnormalities are commonly observed as well as pulmonary involvement. The latter may occur with a wide range, being found in 20–90% of patients with SLE.

### Clinical and radiological features of lung disorders related to connective-tissue diseases: a pictorial essay [^114pkdjT]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Lung involvement

All pulmonary compartments may be affected: pleura (pleural effusion), lung parenchyma (acute pneumonitis, respiratory infections and ILD), respiratory muscles and pulmonary vessel (acute pulmonary hemorrhage). While acute pulmonary lesions (pulmonary hemorrhage and acute lupus pneumonitis) are usually associated with high levels of systemic lupus activity, chronic pulmonary forms of disease — such as interstitial pneumonitis and fibrosis — can progress independently of other organ involvement. Even if pulmonary disease is not included among the diagnostic criteria, lung involvement, namely in the chronic form, has an important negative effect on prognosis. Furthermore, an increased risk of respiratory infections has been related to some SLE therapies.

In contrast with the high prevalence of pleuritis and acute pulmonary manifestations (50–60%), fibrotic ILD is less commonly found in SLE than in the other collagen tissue diseases, occurring only in a range of 1–15% of patients. It is considered an unusual finding, and also clinical progression is usually slow, remaining often a stable disease. Risk factors for ILDs include: older age at the initial presentation (> 50 years old), longstanding disease (> 10 years), and the presence of overlapping clinical features with scleroderma — such as Raynaud's phenomenon, sclerodactyly, abnormal nailfold capillaries and anti-ribonucleoprotein (RNP) antibodies. Hypocomplementemia, high levels of C-reactive protein, and the presence of cryoglobulins or lupus erythematosus cells in the serum have been also associated with increased risk of ILD development. Finally, the interstitial disease may represent a sequel of acute lupus pneumonitis/DAD pattern.

A minority of patients with SLE (3–8%) have a clinically significant ILD, with symptoms such as dyspnea and cough that are similar in most types of ILD. In the absence of respiratory symptoms, the diagnosis is usually incidental, achieved through the recognition of radiological findings on chest imaging examination, or through the identification of abnormal lung function tests. PFTs may show a restrictive pattern of disease and, most commonly, a DLCO reduction is observed.

### Evaluating the diagnostic and prognostic utility of serial KL-6 measurements in connective tissue disease patients at risk for interstitial lung disease: correlations with pulmonary function tests and high-resolution computed tomography [^115HEUPD]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

However, despite the growing body of literature supporting the utility of KL-6, significant gaps remain in our understanding. The dynamic changes of KL-6 over the course of the disease, its correlation with morphological changes on HRCT, and its relationship with pulmonary function decline are not fully elucidated. Furthermore, while KL-6 appears to correlate with disease severity and progression, its utility in predicting therapeutic responses and long-term patient outcomes has not been robustly explored. Questions also persist regarding the optimal thresholds for KL-6 levels in differentiating disease states and the impact of underlying autoimmune conditions on its levels.

This study aims to evaluate the utility of serial KL-6 measurements in patients with CTD-ILD, investigating how changes in KL-6 levels correlate with alterations in pulmonary function tests, HRCT findings, and overall clinical progression. By integrating longitudinal clinical data, this research seeks to validate and potentially expand the prognostic and diagnostic capabilities of KL-6, with the ultimate goal of enhancing the clinical management of patients with CTD-ILD. The findings from this study could also provide insights into the broader implications of using biomarkers like KL-6 in routine clinical practice, paving the way for more personalized and effective therapeutic strategies in managing these complex disorders.

Eligibility criteria

Patients with AE of systemic autoimmune disease-ILD were eligible for this review. Systemic autoimmune diseases of interest consisted of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic sclerosis (SSc), polymyositis/dermatomyositis (PM/DM) including clinically amyopathic DM (CADM), Sjögren's syndrome (SS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), which were all diagnosed based on widely accepted classification criteria such as the 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism criteria for RA. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides such as microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) were also eligible as a systemic autoimmune disease, which was diagnosed based on a previous consensus statement. ILD was diagnosed radiologically and/or pathologically and its patterns were classified following the international classification criteria such as an official American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society statement. Systemic autoimmune disease-ILD was defined as chronic IP that preceded or followed the diagnosis of defined systemic autoimmune diseases. As there were no established diagnostic criteria for AE of systemic autoimmune disease-ILD, the previous international group report for AE of IPF was applied to diagnose AE of systemic autoimmune disease-ILD, which consisted of acute worsening or development of dyspnoea (typically occurring within less than one month) and newly emerging bilateral ground glass opacity (GGO) and/or consolidation superimposed on background reticular or honeycomb patterns on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans. Although it was necessary to rule out cardiac failure or fluid overload as a cause of deterioration of systemic autoimmune disease-ILD, infections or other potential triggers did not need to be excluded, which accounted for both triggered and idiopathic cases. Although the presence of underlying radiological and/or pathological changes consistent with chronic IP was required, they were not limited to UIP given the finding that systemic autoimmune disease-ILD is morphologically diverse. Acute progressive form of IP at the first presentation was excluded if underlying chronic ILD complicated with systemic autoimmune diseases was not identified. In addition, PM/DM/CADM with acute worsening of ILD within 3 months after the diagnosis of the disease were also ineligible to exclude rapidly progressive ILD concomitant with the disease. ILD accompanied by undefined systemic autoimmune diseases or interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) was not excluded unless it constituted the majority of subjects. In cases where patients had multiple episodes of AE, only the first presentation of the disease was considered for further analysis.

### The role of radiology in the management of systemic sclerosis [^117Y2sGk]. Clinical Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Systemic sclerosis is a multisystem connective tissue disorder. Radiology plays an integral part in its management, guiding the clinician concerning the onset and severity of visceral involvement. After skin involvement, the gastrointestinal tract is the most commonly affected system; contrast radiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) play a role in diagnosis. Non-specific interstitial pneumonia is the most frequent respiratory disease and high-resolution computed tomography (CT) is the cornerstone of management. In common with other rheumatic disorders, the role of cardiac MRI is expanding. Radiography remains the main technique in the investigation of skeletal involvement, although MRI is useful as a problem-solving tool. Neurological involvement is increasingly recognized and the major role of radiology is the exclusion of coexistent pathology. We present a thorough review of the role of radiology in the management of systemic sclerosis.

Objective

We provide evidence-based recommendations regarding screening for interstitial lung disease (ILD) and the monitoring for ILD progression in people with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARDs), specifically rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, mixed connective tissue disease, and Sjögren disease.

Methods

We developed clinically relevant population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes questions related to screening and monitoring for ILD in patients with SARDs. A systematic literature review was performed, and the available evidence was rated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology. A Voting Panel of interdisciplinary clinician experts and patients achieved consensus on the direction and strength of each recommendation.

Results

Fifteen recommendations were developed. For screening people with these SARDs at risk for ILD, we conditionally recommend pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and high-resolution computed tomography of the chest (HRCT chest); conditionally recommend against screening with 6-minute walk test distance (6MWD), chest radiography, ambulatory desaturation testing, or bronchoscopy; and strongly recommend against screening with surgical lung biopsy. We conditionally recommend monitoring ILD with PFTs, HRCT chest, and ambulatory desaturation testing and conditionally recommend against monitoring with 6MWD, chest radiography, or bronchoscopy. We provide guidance on ILD risk factors and suggestions on frequency of testing to evaluate for the development of ILD in people with SARDs.

Conclusion

This clinical practice guideline presents the first recommendations endorsed by the American College of Rheumatology and American College of Chest Physicians for the screening and monitoring of ILD in people with SARDs.

Discussion

KL6 Utility in CTD-ILD

The role of KL-6, a mucin-like high-molecular-weight glycoprotein, has been increasingly recognized in the management of ILD, particularly those associated with CTD. Our study underscores the potential of serial KL-6 measurements as a valuable biomarker in both diagnosing and monitoring the progression of CTD-ILDs. Elevated KL-6 levels were consistently associated with worsening pulmonary function, affirming its utility in reflecting ongoing epithelial damage and disease activity. Furthermore, the integration of biomarkers like KL-6 into the management of CTD-ILD represents a critical stride towards precision medicine in pulmonary care. As noted in recent literature, ILDs associated with CTD can present diverse responses to conventional treatments, necessitating more personalized therapeutic strategies. This personalized approach not only has the potential to improve efficacy and reduce treatment-related toxicities but also underscores the importance of biomarker-driven decision-making in chronic diseases. In light of these considerations, this study's findings could significantly shift the paradigm in the diagnosis, monitoring, and management of CTD-ILD, providing a foundation for future research into other novel biomarkers and their integration into clinical protocols.

### A practical approach to high-resolution CT of diffuse lung disease [^114Ti8NG]. European Journal of Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Diffuse lung disease presents a variety of high-resolution CT findings reflecting its complex pathology, and provides diagnostic challenge to radiologists. Frequent modification of detailed pathological classification makes it difficult to keep up with the latest understanding. In this review, we describe a practical approach to high-resolution CT diagnosis of diffuse lung disease, emphasizing (1) analysis of "distribution" of the abnormalities, (2) interpretation of "pattern" in relation to distribution, (3) utilization of associated imaging findings and clinical information, and (4) chronicity of the findings. This practical approach will help radiologists establish a way to interpret high-resolution CT, leading to pin-point diagnosis or narrower differential diagnoses of diffuse lung diseases.

### Interstitial lung diseases associated with collagen vascular diseases: radiologic and histopathologic findings [^114fis2J]. Radiographics (2002). Low credibility.

Collagen vascular diseases that demonstrate features of interstitial lung disease include systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, progressive systemic sclerosis, dermatomyositis and polymyositis, ankylosing spondylitis, Sjögren syndrome, and mixed connective tissue disease. At histopathologic analysis, interstitial lung diseases associated with collagen vascular diseases are diverse and include nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, usual interstitial pneumonia, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), apical fibrosis, diffuse alveolar damage, and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia. Although proportions of interstitial pneumonias vary, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia accounts for a large proportion, especially in progressive systemic sclerosis, dermatomyositis and polymyositis, and mixed connective tissue disease. The more favorable prognosis in interstitial pneumonia associated with collagen vascular diseases than in idiopathic interstitial pneumonias may be explained by the larger proportion of nonspecific interstitial pneumonia than of usual interstitial pneumonia. High-resolution computed tomography seems to help characterize and determine the extent of interstitial lung disease in collagen vascular diseases.

### Pulmonary involvement in systemic sclerosis [^112TDdZW]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a multi-systemic autoimmune disease that mainly affects the skin, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, heart and kidneys. Pulmonary disease in patients with SSc is strongly associated with mortality. The mechanisms involved into its pathophysiology include the activation of autoimmune cells and hyperplasia of fibroblasts with an increased capacity to produce collagen and diminished collagen breakdown. Although pulmonary biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of interstitial lung disease in SSc, the most commonly used method is high-resolution computed tomography due to its high sensitivity and specificity. Herein, a comprehensive review on the pulmonary involvement in SSc is presented highlighting the radiologic-pathologic correlations.

### Practical guidance for the early recognition and follow-up of patients with connective tissue disease-related interstitial lung disease [^115RnZzT]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The early detection and management of (progressive) interstitial lung disease in patients with connective tissue diseases requires the attention and skills of a multidisciplinary team. However, there are currently no well-established standards to guide the daily practice of physicians treating this heterogenous group of diseases.

Research Question

This paper aimed to identify gaps in scientific knowledge along the journey of patients with connective tissue disease-related interstitial lung disease and to provide tools for earlier identification of interstitial lung disease and progressive disease.

Study Design and Methods

The opinions of an international expert panel, which consisted of pulmonologists and rheumatologists were collected and interpreted in the light of peer-reviewed data.

Results

Interstitial lung disease is a common complication of connective tissue diseases, but prevalence estimates vary by subtype. Screening and monitoring by means of clinical examination, chest radiography, pulmonary function testing, and disease-specific biomarkers provide insight into the disease activity of patients presenting with connective tissue diseases in a routine setting. Multiple phenotypic and genotypic characteristics have been identified as predictors of the development and progression of interstitial lung disease. However, these risk factors differ between subtypes. To ensure earlier diagnosis of rapidly progressive phenotypes, a risk-based method is necessary for determining the need for HRCT and additional testing.

Interpretation

To reduce the underdiagnosis of CTD-ILDs in clinical practice, a standardized and systematic multidisciplinary risk-based approach is suggested. Collaboration across disciplines is essential for the management of CTD-ILD.

III. Treatment of organ-based complications of SSc

Key therapies and treatment of organ-based disease in SSc

For all people diagnosed with SSc there should be a focus on identification and treatment of specific complications and organ-based disease. The following section summarizes guidance for managing common aspects of SSc. The topics are informed by key questions defined during the scoping of this guideline underpinned by the results of associated systematic literature reviews.

Cardio-pulmonary complications

Cardiorespiratory manifestations are critical in managing SSc, accounting for most SSc-related deaths as well as major morbidity. There has been progress in management of all three aspects since the previous BSR guideline.

Interstitial lung disease (lung fibrosis)

What is the best management for interstitial lung disease in SSc?

Recommendation for screening and monitoring of interstitial lung disease in SSc (SSc-ILD):

All SSc cases should be screened for ILD with baseline chest high-resolution CT (HRCT) and pulmonary function tests (PFTs; including spirometry and gas transfer) (1B, 97%).
In confirmed SSc-ILD, PFTs should be repeated every 3–6 months in recently diagnosed SSc (first 3–5 years) and considered every 6–12 months thereafter (1B, 96%).
Chest HRCT should be repeated to evaluate ILD progression if worsening symptoms/PFTs and to exclude alternative causes of worsening. Consider repeating chest HRCT to compare with baseline after 1–3 years, or pre-treatment changes (2B, 97%).

### Thoracic and cardiovascular imaging manifestations of lupus [^1135dYYo]. Radiographics (2025). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), commonly referred to as lupus, is a widely prevalent chronic autoimmune disease that can affect any organ system in the body. Although the pathogenesis of this disease is rather complex and poorly understood, ultimately there is an overproduction of multiple self-reactive antinuclear antibodies. These autoantibodies are one of the laboratory hallmarks of the diagnosis and disease activity of SLE. Lupus has a myriad of symptoms and imaging manifestations. Serositis, one of the most common manifestations of the disease, usually occurs with pleural or pericardial effusion with or without associated serosal inflammatory changes. The pulmonary manifestations are heterogeneous, with mostly acute (eg, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, acute lupus pneumonitis) and some chronic (eg, fibrosing interstitial lung disease, shrinking lung syndrome) lung findings. Cardiac and vascular manifestations include myocarditis; coronary artery disease, including accelerated atherosclerosis; myocardial infarction; and spontaneous dissections, along with vasculitis, aneurysms, Libman-Sacks endocarditis, and arterial and venous thromboembolism. Although patient history and risk factor assessment have a vital role in diagnosing lupus, familiarity with the imaging manifestations aids radiologists in optimizing patient care, assessing for complications, and uncovering undiagnosed cases of lupus. This fact emphasizes the importance of recognizing the complex multisystem involvement of lupus seen at imaging. In this article, the authors review the thoracic and cardiovascular imaging manifestations of lupus. © RSNA, 2024.

### Clinical and radiological features of lung disorders related to connective-tissue diseases: a pictorial essay [^1115EyEx]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Connective tissue diseases (CTDs) include a spectrum of disorders that affect the connective tissue of the human body; they include autoimmune disorders characterized by immune-mediated chronic inflammation and the development of fibrosis. Lung involvement can be misdiagnosed, since pulmonary alterations preceded osteo-articular manifestations only in 20% of cases and they have no clear clinical findings in the early phases. All pulmonary structures may be interested: pulmonary interstitium, airways, pleura and respiratory muscles. Among these autoimmune disorders, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), pulmonary nodules and airway disease with air-trapping, whereas non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), pulmonary hypertension and esophageal dilatation are frequently revealed in systemic sclerosis (SSc). NSIP and organizing pneumonia (OP) may be found in patients having polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM); in some cases, perilobular consolidations and reverse halo-sign areas may be observed. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by serositis, acute lupus pneumonitis and alveolar hemorrhage. In the Sjögren syndrome (SS), the most frequent pattern encountered on HRCT images is represented by NSIP; UIP and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP) are reported with a lower frequency. Finally, fibrotic NSIP may be the interstitial disease observed in patients having mixed connective tissue diseases (MCTD). This pictorial review therefore aims to provide clinical features and imaging findings associated with autoimmune CTDs, in order to help radiologists, pneumologists and rheumatologists in their diagnoses and management.

### Rheumatoid arthritis: spectrum of computed tomographic findings in pulmonary diseases [^115DDN7j]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common systemic disease that manifests as inflammatory arthritis of multiple joints. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is the most common manifestation of rheumatoid lung disease. The ILDs associated with RA are diverse and it is very important for the general radiologist to differentiate one from another. There are many other pulmonary diseases apart from ILD. These are associated with a wide spectrum of morphologic changes with substantially different prognoses. The diagnosis of most of these diseases is by clinicoradiological correlation and some of them need pathologic correlation. High-resolution computed tomography helps to characterize and determine the extent of ILD in RA. When interpreting the high-resolution computed tomography of the chest in RA, the radiologist should be familiar with the findings in each entity and comment on activity of the disease, which helps in assessing the prognosis and need for active intervention. This pictorial essay reviews the spectrum of pulmonary diseases in RA and their differential diagnosis.

BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are a heterogeneous group of pulmonary disorders characterized by progressive fibrosis and inflammation of the lung parenchyma. This group encompasses a broad spectrum of etiologies, ranging from environmental exposures to systemic diseases. Connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung diseases (CTD-ILDs) represent a notable subset of these conditions, where pulmonary manifestations are intricately linked with systemic autoimmune diseases such as systemic sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and mixed connective tissue disease. In these patients, the lung involvement often serves as a significant determinant of morbidity and mortality. The clinical course of CTD-ILD is highly variable, influenced by the specific CTD involved, the extent of lung damage, and the responsiveness to therapy. Recent studies have highlighted the variability in disease progression and patient-reported outcomes in fibrotic ILDs, including CTD-ILDs, emphasizing the need for effective biomarkers to guide treatment and predict outcomes.

Traditional diagnostic and monitoring techniques, including clinical assessment, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), often fall short in precisely delineating disease activity and predicting outcomes due to the complex nature of CTD-ILD. Moreover, the integration of innovative diagnostic tools such as the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) has been suggested to enhance clinical assessments in ILD patients. Amid these challenges, Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6), a mucin-like high-molecular-weight glycoprotein predominantly expressed by type II alveolar cells and bronchiolar epithelial cells, has gained prominence as a potential biomarker in the management of ILDs. Elevated serum levels of KL-6 are indicative of increased epithelial cell turnover and damage, features that are prominent in the pathogenesis of ILDs. Studies have consistently shown that high levels of KL-6 are associated with disease activity in various forms of ILD, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and CTD-ILD, suggesting its role in both diagnosis and disease monitoring. Furthermore, KL-6 has been linked to the progression of fibrotic changes in ILDs, adding a layer of complexity to patient management and highlighting its potential as a marker for therapeutic response.

### High-resolution CT of pediatric lung disease [^117Qo6Su]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

High-resolution CT in children remains a technically challenging procedure, both to perform optimally and to interpret correctly. Although much remains to be learned about its optimal application, it is apparent that often confusing or nonspecific chest radiographs are clarified and a much clearer understanding is being gained about the diagnosis and evolution of both common and unusual pediatric lung diseases. As new therapies become available for these disorders, and CT becomes faster and easier to perform, it will become increasingly used not only for more accurate diagnosis but also for better evaluation of effects of therapy.

### Imaging of pulmonary manifestations of connective tissue disease [^111zw7X5]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

The majority of connective tissue diseases (CTDs) are multisystem disorders that are often heterogeneous in their presentation and do not have a single laboratory, histologic, or radiologic feature that is defined as the gold standard to support a specific diagnosis. Given this challenging situation, the diagnosis of CTD is a process that requires the synthesis of multidisciplinary data which may include patient clinical symptoms, serologic evaluation, laboratory testing, and imaging. Pulmonary manifestations of connective tissue disease include interstitial lung disease as well as multicompartmental manifestations. These CT imaging patterns and features of specific diseases will be discussed in this article.

### The identification and management of interstitial lung disease in systemic sclerosis: evidence-based European consensus statements [^113F54pD]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Background

Systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (ILD) carries a high mortality risk; expert guidance is required to aid early recognition and treatment. We aimed to develop the first expert consensus and define an algorithm for the identification and management of the condition through application of well established methods.

Methods

Evidence-based consensus statements for systemic sclerosis-associated ILD management were established for six domains (ie, risk factors, screening, diagnosis and severity assessment, treatment initiation and options, disease progression, and treatment escalation) using a modified Delphi process based on a systematic literature analysis. A panel of 27 Europe-based pulmonologists, rheumatologists, and internists with expertise in systemic sclerosis-associated ILD participated in three rounds of online surveys, a face-to-face discussion, and a WebEx meeting, followed by two supplemental Delphi rounds, to establish consensus and define a management algorithm. Consensus was considered achieved if at least 80% of panellists indicated agreement or disagreement.

Findings

Between July 1, 2018, and Aug 27, 2019, consensus agreement was reached for 52 primary statements and six supplemental statements across six domains of management, and an algorithm was defined for clinical practice use. The agreed statements most important for clinical use included: all patients with systemic sclerosis should be screened for systemic sclerosis-associated ILD using high-resolution CT; high-resolution CT is the primary tool for diagnosing ILD in systemic sclerosis; pulmonary function tests support screening and diagnosis; systemic sclerosis-associated ILD severity should be measured with more than one indicator; it is appropriate to treat all severe cases; no pharmacological treatment is an option for some patients; follow-up assessments enable identification of disease progression; progression pace, alongside disease severity, drives decisions to escalate treatment.

Interpretation

Through a robust modified Delphi process developed by a diverse panel of experts, the first evidence-based consensus statements were established on guidance for the identification and medical management of systemic sclerosis-associated ILD.

### High-resolution CT of diffuse interstitial lung disease: key findings in common disorders [^111HBwXN]. European Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

High-resolution CT (HRCT) is the radiological imaging technique that most closely reflects changes in lung structure. It represents the radiological method of choice for the diagnostic work-up of patients with known or suspected diffuse interstitial lung disease. A single HRCT finding is frequently nonspecific, but the combination of the various HRCT findings together with their anatomic distribution can suggest the most probable diagnosis. The purpose of this article is to summarize the classic HRCT features of the most common diffuse interstitial lung diseases. Lists of differential diagnoses and distinguishing key features are provided to improve diagnostic confidence. The presence of classic HRCT features often obviates the need for biopsy. In patients with atypical findings, HRCT can be used to determine the most appropriate biopsy site.

### Pulmonary and thrombotic manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus [^111xXGB2]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is considered the archetypal systemic autoimmune disease. Clinically characterized by multisystem involvement and varied serologic abnormalities, no two patients present or have disease that evolves in exactly the same way. Viewed histologically, SLE is characterized by some combination of inflammation and fibrosis, and the clinical phenotype is dictated by the relative contributions of each and the organs affected. Tissue injury appears to be mediated by characteristic autoantibody production, immune complex formation, and their organ-specific deposition. As expected in a multisystem disease, the entire pulmonary system is vulnerable to injury. Any of its compartments-airways, lung parenchyma, vasculature, pleura, or the respiratory musculature-may be independently or simultaneously affected. This article offers the reader a comprehensive review of the numerous pulmonary and thrombotic manifestations of SLE and suggests approaches to their management.

Methods

Study design and population

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients newly diagnosed with SLE (within 2 years of diagnosis) at Wuhan Union Hospital between 2007 and 2019. All eligible patients were consecutively enrolled to minimize selection bias. SLE diagnosis was confirmed using either the 2012 Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics classification criteria or the American College of Rheumatology 1997 classification criteria. We included SLE patients with ILD and PAH confirmed as SLE-related complications. ILD was diagnosed by pulmonary High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) and PAH was diagnosed by transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) examination. ILD/PAH attributable to other causes (e.g. idiopathic, drug-induced, or other CTDs), ILD/PAH as initial presenting manifestations, overlap syndromes with other CTDs or incomplete clinical data were excluded from this study. A total of 193 SLE-ILD-PAH patients and 145 SLE controls were enrolled in the study (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Flow chart showing the study design

Clinical variables and data collection

Baseline data were collected at SLE diagnosis, including demographics (age, gender, smoking/alcohol history, comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes)), clinical features (rash, arthritis, nephritis, neurological symptoms, pleuritis/pericarditis), laboratory tests (routine blood/urine tests, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), complement levels, autoantibody spectrum) and disease activity (SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score). Overall, 26 clinical variables were initially selected for further analysis.

Acquisition and analysis of HRCT imaging

All HRCT scans were obtained in the supine position, using one of the following scanners: SOMATOM Perspective, SOMATOM Spirit or SOMATOM Definition AS+ (Siemens Healthineers, Forchheim, Germany). Scans were done from the level of the upper thoracic inlet to the inferior level of the costophrenic angle. For each patient, the predominant CT patterns such as GGO, consolidation, reticulation, emphysema, thickening of the adjacent pleura, pleural effusion, presence of nodules or masses, honey combing, bronchiectasis and interlobar pleural traction were independently reviewed by two experienced observers according to the Fleischner Society glossary.

### Interstitial lung disease – the new synergy between radiology and pathology [^113rmDPM]. Histopathology (2006). Low credibility.

In the last 30 years, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) has been the major advance in diagnosis of diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD). We review the diagnostic accuracy of HRCT and discuss how the gold standard in diagnosis of DPLD has shifted from histopathological diagnosis in isolation to a multidisciplinary approach. This latter process is now accepted as providing the highest levels of diagnostic accuracy in patients with DPLD and lung biopsy is primarily reserved for cases with atypical clinical or radiological presentations.

### High-resolution computed tomography of the chest for the screening, re-screening and follow-up of systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease: a EUSTAR-SCTC survey [^115g3U92]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest is the gold standard to diagnose interstitial lung disease (ILD). A prior survey reported that fewer than 60% of SSc-treating rheumatologists order an HRCT for ILD screening in newly diagnosed SSc patients. Since then, efforts were initiated to increase awareness of HRCT as a screening tool. Aim of the present study was to assess efficacy of these awareness programs.

Methods

European Scleroderma Trials and Research (EUSTAR) and Scleroderma Clinical Trials Consortium (SCTC) members answered a survey about the use of HRCT at diagnosis, the re-screening of patients with a negative baseline HRCT, and the follow-up of HRCT positive SSc-ILD patients. When HRCT was not routinely requested, additional details were collected.

Results

Among 205 physician responders, 95.6% would perform an HRCT at SSc diagnosis: 64.9% as routine screening for ILD (65.4% of SSc referral and 63.6% of non-referral physicians) and 30.7% upon clinical suspicion (95.2% in case of crackles on auscultation). Among non-screening physicians, clinical and ethical concerns were major driving factors for not ordering HRCTs. During follow-up, 79.0% of responders would repeat HRCTs in baseline negative cases: 14.1% as routine screening and 64.9% for diagnostic purposes. Finally, 93.2% of responders would repeat a chest HRCT after SSc-ILD diagnosis: 36.6% as yearly routine and 56.6% according to clinical evaluation.

Conclusions

The use of baseline HRCT for the screening of SSc-ILD has slightly increased, but awareness programs should be adapted for further improvement. HRCT use in re-screening and follow-up may benefit from validated algorithms.

### Role of imaging in the diagnosis of diffuse and interstitial lung diseases [^111Zd7B8]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review aims to provide a literature update focused on the role of imaging in the diagnosis, prognosis and quantification of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs). Special emphasis is given in the management of atypical cases and in the multidisciplinary team approach in reaching the diagnosis of the various ILDs.

Recent Findings

Accumulated knowledge on imaging has increased the accuracy of differential diagnosis in atypical cases, in overlap of findings and in secondary as opposed to idiopathic ILDs. There is increasing awareness about interstitial lung abnormalities in smokers' lungs from lung cancer screening and indirect evidence of linkage of fibrosis and smoking. Improvement in radiologic-pathologic correlation reveals less typical high-resolution computed tomography patterns to be predictive of pulmonary fibrosis. Major diagnostic criteria such as honeycombing may be hampered by the coexistence of emphysema. High-resolution computed tomography may predict clinical outcome and survival of patients in ILDs and is a decision maker in the multidisciplinary approach of diagnosis.

Summary

High-resolution computed tomography plays a crucial role in the diagnosis, prognosis, quantification and monitoring of ILDs. It provides a definite noninvasive diagnosis in typical findings and helps in reaching the most accurate diagnosis in a multidisciplinary discussion in equivocal cases.

Connective tissue diseases (CTDs) are a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by circulating autoantibodies and autoimmune-mediated organ damage. Common CTDs with lung manifestations are rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma or systemic sclerosis, Sjögren syndrome, polymyositis/dermatomyositis, systemic lupus erythematosis, mixed connective tissue disease, and undifferentiated connective tissue disease. The most common histopathologic patterns of CTD-related interstitial lung disease are nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, usual interstitial pneumonia, organizing pneumonia, and lymphoid interstitial pneumonia. Drug treatment of CTDs can cause complications, including opportunistic infection.

### Pulmonary disease in systemic lupus erythematosus and the antiphospholpid syndrome [^111Z3fy5]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by disturbances in innate and adaptive immune mechanisms. Multiple systems and organs may be involved. Tissue damage and dysfunction are mediated by autoantibodies and immune complex formation. The lungs are among the organ systems commonly involved. The pulmonary manifestations usually occur in patients with multisystem disease and include: pleural involvement, parenchymal disease, pulmonary vascular disease and diaphragmatic dysfunction. Manifestations may range from sub-clinical abnormalities to life threatening disorders. Many of the pulmonary manifestations characteristic of SLE are seen in the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) as well, in both the primary and secondary syndrome. In this review the diverse pulmonary manifestations are described as well as the diagnostic modalities available, including the use of induced sputum evaluation for early diagnosis and follow up. New treatment modalities are referred to.

### Assessment of cardiopulmonary manifestations and its correlation with semi-quantitative scoring of high-resolution computed tomography in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases [^114Na8FW]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

There were limited studies that correlate the CT score in ARD with RV function by ECHO. For example, Pandey et al. found that the total HRCT score correlated with elevated pulmonary arterial pressures (PAP). Their study showed a significant relationship between the peak PAP and the total CT score (p < 0.0001). They stated that the fibrotic score was the most determinant factor of pulmonary hypertension (PH) on ECHO, which can help in the screening of SSc patients for PH by the extent of pulmonary fibrosis.

Some patients had significant elevations in the PAP although they had small or no lung fibrosis. This could explain why multiple factors contribute to the occurrence of PH in people with scleroderma, including pulmonary vasculopathy and capillary bed obliteration, and lung fibrosis may be the main factor.

The study by Mukerjee et al. found that the EPASP on echo (mmHg) was 39 ± 15 in scleroderma patients without lung fibrosis and 46 ± 18 in scleroderma patients with lung fibrosis detected by HRCT. In the study of Mohammed et al. the mean EPASP in the studied SLE patients was 31 ± 5.1 mmHg with no significant variation between the diseased and control group.

There were some limitations in this study e.g. the total number of participants was small in each group of diseases, not all diseases of ARD are involved, the scoring system used didn't include other CT abnormalities e.g. emphysematous changes in ARD, and more PFT parameters need to be evaluated e.g. TLCO. We recommend further studies on a large number of participants with ARD with the comparison between different types of CT scoring systems that include more abnormalities recording.

### The radiologist's role in detecting systemic anticancer therapy-related interstitial lung disease: an educational review [^116vdnzt]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Systemic anticancer therapies (SACTs) are the leading cause of drug-induced interstitial lung disease (ILD). As more novel SACTs become approved, the incidence of this potentially life-threatening adverse event (AE) may increase. Early detection of SACT-related ILD allows for prompt implementation of drug-specific management recommendations, improving the likelihood of AE resolution and, in some instances, widening the patient's eligibility for future cancer treatment options. ILD requires a diagnosis of exclusion through collaboration with the patient's multidisciplinary team to rule out other possible etiologies of new or worsening respiratory signs and symptoms. At Grade 1, ILD is asymptomatic, and thus the radiologist is key to detecting the AE prior to the disease severity worsening. Planned computed tomography scans should be reviewed for the presence of ILD in addition to being assessed for tumor response to treatment, and when ILD is suspected, a high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan should be requested immediately. An HRCT scan, with < 2-mm slice thickness, is the most appropriate method for detecting ILD. Multiple patterns of ILD exist, which can impact patient prognosis. The four main patterns include acute interstitial pneumonia / acute respiratory distress syndrome, organizing pneumonia, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and non-specific interstitial pneumonia; their distinct radiological features, along with rarer patterns, are discussed here. Furthermore, HRCT is essential for following the course of ILD and might help to determine the intensity of AE management and the appropriateness of re-challenging with SACT, where indicated by drug-specific prescribing information. ILD events should be monitored closely until complete resolution.

Critical relevance statement

The incidence of potentially treatment-limiting and life-threatening systemic anticancer therapy-related interstitial lung disease (SACT-related ILD) events is likely increasing as more novel regimens become approved. This review provides best-practice recommendations for the early detection of SACT-related ILD by radiologists.

Key Points

Radiologists are crucial in detecting asymptomatic (Grade 1) ILD before severity/prognosis worsens.
High-resolution computed tomography is the most appropriate method for detecting ILD.
Drug-induced ILD is a diagnosis of exclusion, involving a multidisciplinary team.
Familiarity with common HRCT patterns, described here, is key for prompt detection.
Physicians should highlight systemic anticancer therapies (SACTs) with a known risk for interstitial lung diseases (ILD) on scan requisitions.

### Clinical and radiological features of lung disorders related to connective-tissue diseases: a pictorial essay [^1172JCza]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

PH occurs in SLE female patients — typically under the age of 40 years; risk factors include the presence of serositis, interstitial disease, Raynaud's phenomenon, anticardiolipin and anti-U1 RNP antibodies. Dyspnea during exercise is often the first symptom and PFTs may show reduced values; however, the gold standard for diagnosis is right heart catheterization. HRCT is useful to exclude other diseases such as ILD, often showing enlarged pulmonary vessels and compromised pulmonary/aorta ratio.

Pulmonary thromboembolism may be found in those patients with SLE: there is a direct correlation between antiphospholipid (APL) antibodies levels to lupus anticoagulant activity and inhibition of activated protein C, thereby producing a prothrombotic effect and increasing the risk of a thromboembolic event. Clinically, patients may present with sudden onset pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea or hypoxemia. Computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) may reveal filling defects of the main arterial pulmonary branches, or segmental and subsegmental pulmonary vessels.

Sjögren syndrome (SS)

SS, also known as "sicca syndrome", is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease of the exocrine glands, caused by parenchymal lymphocytic infiltration; the disease is characterized by xerostomia and xerophthalmia.

This disease is relatively common, and has been found in 0.1% of the population; it has been distinguished in primary or secondary SS, depending on whether it is associated or not with other CTDs — most commonly RA, SLE and SSc. In a retrospective study from the United States, the annual incidence reported for primary SS was 3.9 per 100,000.

A diagnosis of SS is based on the weighted sum of 5 items, which include: (1) labial salivary glands with focal lymphocytic sialadenitis (weight 3 points); (2) identification of anti-nuclear antibodies against ribonucleoproteins Ro/SSA (weight 3 points); (3) ocular staining score ≥ 5 in at least 1 eye (weight 1 point); (4) Schirmer's test ≤ 5 mm/5 min in at least 1 eye (weight 1 point); (5) unstimulated saliva flow rate ≤ 0.1 ml/min (weight 1 point). According to this ACR-EULAR 2016 Classification Criteria, diagnosis of Sjögren Syndrome is achieved in patients having a score ≥ 4.

Extra-glandular and systemic manifestations involve kidney, central nervous system and lung; the presence of the latter is associated with a fourfold increased risk of mortality after 10 years of the disease.

### High-resolution CT of diffuse lung disease: value and limitations [^1139Px1v]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The relative speed with which HRCT has become the imaging technique of choice for evaluating patients with suspected lung disease can be regarded as a testament to its effectiveness. It is as well, however, to remember some of the caveats that apply to the interpretation of the numerous studies that have championed the clinical application of HRCT. It seems unlikely that CT will be supplanted in the near future by other cross-sectional or volumetric imaging techniques for the evaluation of diffuse lung disease. The scope for further technical refinement of the hardware aspects of HRCT is probably limited but improvements in postprocessing of image data, with the potential to advance understanding of the pathophysiology of diffuse lung disease, can be anticipated.

Approach to Evaluation and Management of ILAs

The suggested evaluation and management of ILAs are summarized in Figure 3, with additional details described in the remarks for each PICO question. The approach may need to be modified based on local resources and shared decision-making with patients. This approach was developed to prioritize the identification and appropriate management of ILAs at the highest risk of progression to ILD.

Evaluation and management of interstitial lung abnormality (ILA). Actions shown in darker green boxes indicate recommendations formulated based on prespecified population-intervention-control-outcome (PICO) questions, with the PICO question number shown in parentheses. Actions shown in lighter green boxes indicate additional suggestions that were not the subject of prespecified PICO questions. PICO questions that did not reach consensus are shown in dashed boxes at the bottom of the algorithm in yellow (no recommendation) and red (recommendation against). *Other high-risk populations may be appropriate for screening (e.g. high-risk occupations). † Patients at increased risk for lung cancer are recommended to undergo chest computed tomography (CT) screening for lung cancer. We further recommend systematic assessment and documentation of the presence or absence of ILAs/interstitial lung disease (ILD) in smokers who are undergoing lung cancer screening with a chest CT scan. ‡ Connective tissue diseases (CTDs) associated with an increased risk of ILD and that qualify for this recommendation include rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, antisynthetase syndrome, mixed CTD, Sjogren's disease, undifferentiated CTD, or overlap syndrome. § Including high-resolution CT if not already performed. A multidisciplinary approach is ideal if local resources allow. ‖ CTD assessment includes symptom assessment (e.g. skin changes, weakness, arthritis, dry eyes/dry mouth) and physical examination with autoimmune serologies considered when clinically indicated. Frequency of reassessment depends on risk assessment per Table 4. High-risk features associated with ILA progression include family history of pulmonary fibrosis, older age, smoking history, other inhaled exposures (e.g. occupational vapors, gases, dusts and fumes; air pollution), CTD, presence of the MUC5B promoter variant, leukocyte telomere length below age-adjusted 10th percentile, presence of definite fibrosis on CT (i.e. honeycombing, traction bronchiectasis, or architectural distortion), subpleural fibrotic and subpleural nonfibrotic subtypes, subpleural reticulation, greater extent of imaging abnormalities, and abnormal or borderline FVC, TLC, and D CO. It may also be appropriate to reassess more frequently for other indications (e.g. lung cancer screening). Implementation depends on local resources. FPF = familial pulmonary fibrosis (defined as at least two genetically related first- or second-degree relatives with fibrotic ILD); IPF = idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; PFT = pulmonary function test; prevalent ILA = ILA present on baseline and/or follow-up CT scan.

### Thin-section chest CT findings in systemic lupus erythematosus with antiphospholipid syndrome: a comparison with systemic lupus erythematosus without antiphospholipid syndrome [^116BgMni]. European Journal of Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess thin-section chest CT findings in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), in comparison with SLE without APS.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and thin-section CT findings of 17 consecutive patients with an established diagnosis of SLE with APS, comparing with 37 consecutive SLE patients without APS, between 2004 and 2008, and patients who had other autoimmune disease, such as Sjögren syndrome, were excluded. No significant differences were seen between the two groups in age, gender, smoking habits, or history of steroid pulse and biological therapy. CT images of 2mm thickness obtained with a 16- or 64-detector row CT were retrospectively evaluated by two radiologists in consensus on ultra high-resolution gray-scale monitors.

Results

The frequency of thin-section CT abnormalities was higher in SLE with APS group (82%) than in SLE without APS group (43%). Ground-glass opacity (59%), architectural distortion (47%), reticulation (41%), enlarged peripheral pulmonary artery (29%), and mosaic attenuation (29%) were significantly more common in the SLE with APS group than in the SLE without APS group (Fisher's exact test, p < 0.01).

Conclusion

SLE patients with APS have increased prevalence of thin-section chest CT abnormalities than those without APS.

### Different chest HRCT scan protocols change the extent of ground glass opacities [^114TJ8B5]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a connective tissue disease clinically characterized by skin fibrosis and involvement of visceral organs such as lung, kidney and the cardiovascular system. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a common manifestation of visceral involvement. The reported prevalence of ILD, depending on the criteria used, varies from around 20–70% of the patients, and is one of the leading causes of mortality in SSc. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is the reference standard for assessing the presence and severity of SSc-ILD, and is found to be superior to conventional chest x-ray or ultrasound.

The lung involvement in SSc-ILD includes alveolitis in early stages and irreversible fibrosis in more severe cases. Ground glass opacity (GGO) is the HRCT feature representing alveolitis and can be the first signs of ILD or disease activity in an already known ILD. However, GGO can also represent atelectasis due to gravitational forces, edema, or beginning fibrosis. In the absence of additional more specific etiological findings, the interpretation can therefore sometimes be challenging. As the presence and extent of HRCT findings are important for the clinical judgement and choice of therapy, it is important to determine whether the GGO represent active alveolitis or alternative causes such as atelectasis.

### HRCT findings of collagen vascular disease-related interstitial pneumonia (CVD-IP): a comparative study among individual underlying diseases [^116UUms7]. Clinical Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Aim

To identify characteristic high-resolution computed tomography (CT) findings for individual collagen vascular disease (CVD)-related interstitial pneumonias (IPs).

Materials and Methods

The HRCT findings of 187 patients with CVD, including 55 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 50 with systemic sclerosis (SSc), 46 with polymyositis/dermatomyositis (PM/DM), 15 with mixed connective tissue disease, 11 with primary Sjögren's syndrome, and 10 with systemic lupus erythematosus, were evaluated. Lung parenchymal abnormalities were compared among CVDs using χ 2 test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and multiple logistic regression analysis. A CT-pathology correlation was performed in 23 patients.

Results

In RA-IP, honeycombing was identified as the significant indicator based on multiple logistic regression analyses. Traction bronchiectasis (81.8%) was further identified as the most frequent finding based on χ 2 test. In SSc IP, lymph node enlargement and oesophageal dilatation were identified as the indicators based on multiple logistic regression analyses, and ground-glass opacity (GGO) was the most extensive based on Kruskal-Wallis test, which reflects the higher frequency of the pathological nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) pattern present in the CT-pathology correlation. In PM/DM IP, airspace consolidation and the absence of honeycombing were identified as the indicators based on multiple logistic regression analyses, and predominance of consolidation over GGO (32.6%) and predominant subpleural distribution of GGO/consolidation (41.3%) were further identified as the most frequent findings based on χ 2 test, which reflects the higher frequency of the pathological NSIP and/or the organising pneumonia patterns present in the CT-pathology correlation.

Conclusion

Several characteristic high-resolution CT findings with utility for estimating underlying CVD were identified.

### Evaluating the diagnostic and prognostic utility of serial KL-6 measurements in connective tissue disease patients at risk for interstitial lung disease: correlations with pulmonary function tests and high-resolution computed tomography [^112em1Co]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, the findings of this study underscore the critical significance of KL-6 as a biomarker for comprehending and addressing CTD-ILD. Through its ability to offer crucial information on disease activity, advancement, and reaction to interventions, KL-6 stands out as a valuable tool in fine-tuning approaches to these intricate conditions. Its integration into clinical practice has the potential to greatly elevate patient care standards and overall outcomes in managing CTD-ILD. Moreover, with more research and refinement, KL-6 shows promise as a key part of personalized medicine strategies to improve treatment effectiveness for individuals with CTD-ILD. By using KL-6 assessments along with other diagnostic measures, healthcare providers can better customize their treatment approaches for improved long-term outcomes in patients facing these challenging conditions.

The novelty of this study lies in the longitudinal analysis of serial KL-6 measurements, revealing their strong correlations with both pulmonary function tests and HRCT findings over time. This highlights KL-6 not only as a diagnostic tool but also as a dynamic marker for monitoring disease progression and therapeutic response. The study provides compelling evidence supporting the integration of KL-6 into routine clinical practice for a more personalized and precise management of CTD-ILD. The possible clinical implications include earlier detection of disease progression, better monitoring of treatment efficacy, and potentially improved patient outcomes through more tailored therapeutic interventions.

Fig. 21
A 37-year-old patient with ALP, characterized by dyspnea, fever and pleuritic pain; on HRCT images (A, B), bilateral pleural effusions (black arrows) and right lower lobe consolidation (black asterisk) are clearly recognizable

DAH is a relatively rare but severe lung manifestation (1.5% of SLE patients) (Fig. 22). Similar to ALP, it is characterized by an abrupt onset of dyspnea, fever and cough, hemoptysis at presentation, with a specific sudden decrease of hemoglobin. HRCT features are comparable to ALP, showing bilateral consolidations and/or ground-glass opacities. BAL is diagnostic, identifying high neutrophil count, serosanguinous fluid, and hemosiderin-laden macrophages within the lavage.

Fig. 22
DAH in a patient with LSD. Images (A, B) show diffuse bilateral consolidations and ground-glass opacities

Other complications of SLE may include diaphragmatic dysfunction, PH and pulmonary thromboembolism.

Diaphragmatic dysfunction, an uncommon manifestation of SLE, could be related to a reduction of diaphragmatic strength, diaphragm fibrosis, and phrenic nerve palsy. It is manifested by reduced lung volume, reproducing what is known as "the shrinking lung syndrome". As reported by Mathai et al. risk factors include longer disease duration, presence of anti-RNP antibodies, and history of pleuritis. Patients with shrinking lung syndrome often present dyspnea and chest pain; in these cases, PFTs show a restrictive pattern. Radiographic findings may be aspecific, with elevation of diaphragm and basal atelectasis — but no evidence of ILD or pleural disease.

Additional considerations

Uptake of lung cancer screening has not been universal, even after several randomized controlled trials demonstrated that it reduces mortality from lung cancer. Screening programs require considerable infrastructure and resources for follow-up and management of nodules and other incidental findings. There are no comparable data demonstrating a benefit of screening for ILAs/ILD on outcomes, and committee members agreed that a recommendation for screening of all smokers was not warranted at this time. Criteria for lung cancer screening vary from country to country. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends an annual low-dose CT scan for adults aged 50–80 years who have a 20–pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the previous 15 years. Given the overlapping risk profile, the committee believed individuals undergoing CT screening for lung cancer should be assessed for ILAs/ILD. The committee did not address specific language that should be used for reporting of ILAs/ILD on CT scans, but, in general, descriptions should align with definitions established in this document and/or the Fleischner Society. Clinical sites and radiology societies may wish to develop algorithms to standardize reporting as well as risk stratification and follow-up of findings, akin to what is done for lung nodules. Serial follow-up with low-dose CT may be adequate to monitor ILAs, but evaluation of ILD requires HRCT. The committee acknowledges that these suggestions may increase the number of patients referred for evaluation of ILAs/ILD and cause strain on some providers and healthcare systems. Additional discussion of the potential for incidental findings may also be necessary as part of shared decision-making for lung cancer screening. This needs to be considered when implementing screening programs.

Question 2: Should Adults with CTD Undergo Chest CT Screening to Identify ILAs/ILD?

Suggestion

We suggest a baseline chest HRCT scan to screen for ILAs/ILD in adults with CTDs that are associated with an increased risk of ILD. Remarks: CTDs that are associated with an increased risk of ILD include rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, antisynthetase syndrome, mixed CTD, Sjogren's disease, or overlap syndrome. Vote: Approved by 36 of 37 (97%).

### Clinical / pathologic correlations in 553 patients with primary centrilobular findings on high-resolution CT scan of the thorax [^114YWxeb]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical/pathologic correlations in patients with high-resolution CT (HRCT) scan findings presenting with two patterns of centrilobular opacity remain unclear.

Methods

Chest HRCT scans in 553 patients with predominant centrilobular opacities or preferential centrilobular disease were retrospectively evaluated. In 141 patients who underwent biopsy, CT scan images were compared with actual specimens.

Results

Centrilobular nodules with a tree-in-bud appearance and bronchial wall thickening were observed in most patients who were carriers of human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (88 patients and 57 of 99 patients, respectively), Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (44 patients and 45 of 52 patients, respectively), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (38 patients and 37 of 52 patients, respectively), Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (22 patients and 27 of 37 patients, respectively), Mycobacterium kansasii (27 patients and 19 of 33 patients, respectively), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (6 patients and 7 of 9 patients, respectively), diffuse panbronchiolitis (12 patients and 10 of 12 patients, respectively), and diffuse aspiration bronchiolitis (12 patients and 12 of 13 patients, respectively). On the other hand, ill-defined centrilobular nodules of ground-glass attenuation were frequently seen in patients with subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis (all 15 patients), metastatic calcification (all 4 patients), Churg-Strauss syndrome (4 of 12 patients), microscopic polyangiitis (27 of 48 patients), systemic lupus erythematosus (7 of 8 patients), and respiratory bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung disease (all 8 patients). Pathologically, the tree-in-bud appearance correlated well with the plugging of small airways with mucous, pus, or fluid; dilated bronchioles; and bronchiolar wall thickening. Ill-defined centrilobular nodules represented peribronchiolar inflammation or the deposition of hemorrhagic materials.

Conclusions

Knowledge of the two centrilobular patterns is of proven worth for generating differential diagnoses and is of particular value in suggesting a likely infectious etiology in cases with tree-in-bud appearance.

### Connective tissue disease-associated lung disease in children [^112eDk6V]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a severe, chronic, systemic autoimmune disease that impacts multiple organ systems. Approximately 20% of cases are diagnosed during childhood, although very rarely before 5 years of age. While adult-onset SLE is seen predominantly in females at a 13:1 ratio, significantly more males are diagnosed in the pediatric age group with an overall female-to-male ratio of 6:1. Typically, childhood-onset SLE has a more severe clinical phenotype than adult-onset SLE. Thoracic findings of SLE are common and include pleuritis and/or pericarditis with or without effusion, acute and chronic lung disease, shrinking lung syndrome, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and pulmonary embolism.

Among the acute lung diseases seen in the setting of SLE are "acute lupus pneumonitis", which manifests histopathologically as DAD, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). Both of these severe pulmonary manifestations of SLE are rare but, importantly, are associated with a high mortality rate. Chronic lung disease is uncommon in the setting of SLE, with NSIP being the most common pattern observed.

### Unusual diffuse pulmonary amyloidosis in systemic lupus erythematosus: computed tomography findings [^111AsQuJ]. Clinical Imaging (2011). Low credibility.

Pulmonary involvement is a common feature in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. This may include pleuritis, pneumonitis, and pulmonary hemorrhage. However, the presence of diffuse consolidation on chest radiographs is less common, and is usually interpreted as pneumonia. Moreover, consolidations with massive calcifications are a relatively rare manifestation. The association of pulmonary amyloidosis and SLE seems quite unusual, and has rarely been described. We report a patient with SLE and massive multiple calcified consolidations on radiologic images, which were confirmed as secondary amyloidosis.

HRCT findings in patients with rheumatic diseases

HRCT was performed for all patients with rheumatic diseases. Abnormal thoracic HRCT was observed in 8 of the 48 (16.7%) patients, and they were all women (Table 4). There was a significant difference between the sexes (P = 0.015). Among these patients, two had SLE, four had JDM, one had SS, and one had JIA. There was only one type of HRCT alteration in six patients. Two types of alterations were simultaneously found on HRCT in two patients. Radiological abnormalities were as follows: ground-glass opacities (n = 3), linear opacities (n = 1), nodules or micronodules (n = 4), septal thickening (n = 1), and pleural thickening (n = 1). Four of the eight patients (50.0%) also had PFTs abnormalities, including restrictive dysfunction (n = 1), small airway disease (n = 2), and reduction of DL CO (n = 3). HRCT abnormalities were primarily related to rheumatic diseases, and patients with HRCT abnormalities due to infections, drug toxicity, and neoplasia were excluded.

### Changes on chest HRCT in systemic sclerosis-related interstitial lung disease after autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation [^1114VMu6]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Early diffuse cutaneous SSc (dSSc) is a severe autoimmune connective-tissue disease characterized by vasculopathy, immune activation and subsequent fibrosis of skin, lungs, heart, kidney or gastrointestinal tract. Evidence of interstitial lung disease (ILD) on chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) can be found in up to 80% of dSSc patients. Overall 30–40% of SSc patients will develop clinically significant ILD, with a 10-year mortality rate reaching 40%. In SSc patients, chest HRCT has become the 'gold standard' examination for ILD diagnosis, surpassing the use of routine chest X-ray. Detailed chest HRCT allows early detection and characterization of parenchymal involvement before emergence of clinical symptoms. Parenchymal involvement can be present in different patterns, based on the presence of ground glass opacities, reticulation and/or honeycombing, which correlate with histological changes and SSc disease severity. The most common HRCT imaging pattern is non-specific interstitial pneumonia, which is characterized by peripheral ground-glass opacities with an apical to basal gradient, and frequently associated with subpleural sparing. Fibrotic non-specific interstitial pneumonia is identified by the additional presence of reticulations, traction bronchiectasis and bronchiectasis in a similar distribution. The other pattern, usual interstitial pneumonia which is determined by the presence of honeycombing without ground-glass opacities, is observed in 10–20% of patients with SSc-ILD. Overall, the extent of ILD on HRCT is an independent predictor of mortality and ILD progression. The presence of oesophageal dilatation related to disease involvement is another common finding on chest HRCT in SSc patients, and the link between oesophageal involvement and SSc-ILD has been clearly established.

### Consensus guidelines for evaluation and management of pulmonary disease in Sjögren's [^111m6TAU]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Sjögren's pulmonary guidelines — conclusions and recommendation agreement state that pulmonary involvement due to Sjögren's is common with frequent upper and lower airway disease, parenchymal or interstitial lung disease, and associated lymphoproliferative disease, and emphasize a multidisciplinary approach including a rheumatologist, primary care physician, pulmonologist, pathologist, radiologist, and, when appropriate, an oncologist. Recommendation strength ratings were Thirty-five strong, 11 moderate, and six weak, and the lowest agreement was 79% for the weak recommendation to consider performing pulmonary function tests (PFTs) to detect underlying pulmonary manifestations in asymptomatic Sjögren's patients, with concerns including the burden and expense of obtaining PFTs and the improbability of non-pulmonologists ordering them. Overall agreement was high, with 76 of the 102 questions provided for voting receiving higher than 98% agreement. Monitoring and imaging notes include that frequency of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) monitoring will be variable based on cyst size/appearance and clinical presentation, and that accessibility to positron emission tomography (PET), costs, and insurance coverage should be considered, as many US clinicians may have difficulty obtaining payor authorization for a PET scan if it is not ordered by an oncologist or if malignancy is not yet diagnosed by histopathologic confirmation. The guidelines also identify future priorities including epidemiological and risk analyses, blood-based and noninvasive biomarkers, quantitative imaging tools, optimal frequency of repeat PFTs and HRCT testing for each pattern of pulmonary disease, studies on etiology and treatment, and specifically antifibrotics for Sjögren's-ILD.

### Mimics in chest disease: interstitial opacities [^117EG96q]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Since the advent of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in the 1990s the understanding of interstitial lung disease has dramatically changed. As CT descriptions of the various diffuse lung diseases are being continuously refined and certain CT characteristics are considered pathognomonic while others become less specific, HRCT finds its role in an integrated approach of diagnosis where it provides sufficient information to produce a differential diagnosis and in many cases allows a non-invasive definitive diagnosis.

There are various patterns of interstitial lung disease on HRCT, each one representing different interstitial lung diseases with completely different histological appearances and clinical manifestations. The main distinct interstitial HRCT patterns are five: septal, reticular, nodular, cystic, ground-glass and decreased lung attenuation pattern. Although each HRCT pattern encompasses many different interstitial lung entities, the contrary may also occur, namely one entity may present with many different patterns and have many different "faces". To make things even more complicated, there may be overlap of HRCT patterns in one entity. In everyday clinical practice one should try to combine the different HRCT patterns or identify the predominant pattern in order to make the correct diagnosis. Integration of HRCT findings with clinical findings and the knowledge of acute or chronic symptoms is crucial to reach the correct diagnosis.

a Diagnosis of SLS made at the time of diagnosis of SLE

Although extremely rare, it is important to recognize SLS as a possible cause of dyspnea and chest pain in a child with SLE, and be aware that in pediatric patients in particular, this complication may occur at the time of initial presentation of SLE. Our patient clearly stated that his goal for treatment was to return to competitive hockey. Recent literature on rituximab use in SLS, a review of pediatric SLS cases, and our case report suggest that additional therapy, including possible use of rituximab, should be considered in patients with SLS who have an incomplete response to initial immunosuppressive therapy. Careful documentation of the occurrence, treatment and outcome of patients with SLS utilizing large registries of adult and pediatric patients with SLE may help determine optimal treatment for this rare complication.

### Anti-MDA-5 dermatomyositis with tumid lupus-like lesions [^113zFctR]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This case expands the clinical spectrum of dermatomyositis. In our case, the patient initially received a clinical-pathologic diagnosis of tumid lupus erythematosus, given his pink, painful, indurated subcutaneous plaques, and compatible biopsy results. Over time, our patient experienced cutaneous and systemic signs consistent with MDA-5 + DM, including alopecia, fatigue, myalgias, elevated ferritin, and mechanics hands and has responded well to his immune suppressive regimen. Rapidly progressive ILD occurs in 42% to 100% of patients with MDA-5 + DM and is characterized by irreversible, diffuse inflammation and scarring of lung tissue. If not identified and managed early in its disease course, ILD can progress to acute respiratory failure and death. In many cases, the progression of lung disease can outpace other symptoms, making it critical for dermatologists to hold a high index of suspicion for diagnosis, especially in patients with atypical or overlapping autoimmune symptoms.

Studies have shown that early, aggressive treatment with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy can improve survival rates. In our case, timely administration of an immunosuppressive regimen was essential to controlling the systemic manifestations of MDA-5 + DM. Routine monitoring with pulmonary function tests and high-resolution computed tomography scans should be integral to follow-up care for patients with anti- MDA-5 + DM. Herein this case of MDA-5 + DM presenting as tumid lupus underscores the importance of close follow-up, early and aggressive immunosuppression, and interdisciplinary collaboration in managing this disease.

### The usual interstitial pneumonia pattern in autoimmune rheumatic diseases [^111TgXQc]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP) is characterized by progression of lung parenchyma that may be observed in various autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARDs), including rheumatoid arthritis and connective tissue diseases. From a diagnostic point of view, a UIP pattern related to ARDs may display imaging and pathological features able to distinguish it from that related to IPF, such as the "straight-edge" sign at HRCT and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates at histologic specimens. Multidisciplinary approach (MDD), involving at least pulmonologist, rheumatologist and radiologist, is fundamental in the differential diagnosis process, but MDD is also required in the evaluation of severity, progression and response to treatment, that is based on the combination of changes in symptoms, pulmonary function trends, and, in selected patients, serial CT evaluation. Differently from IPF, in patients with ARDs both functional evaluation and patient-reported outcomes may be affected by systemic involvement and comorbidities, including musculoskeletal manifestations of disease. Finally, in regards to pharmacological treatment, immunosuppressants have been considered the cornerstone of therapy, despite the lack of solid evidence in most cases; recently, antifibrotic drugs were also proposed for the treatment of progressive fibrosing ILDs other than IPF. In ARD-ILD, the therapeutic choice should balance the need for the control of systemic and lung involvements with the risk of adverse events from multi-morbidities and -therapies. Purpose of this review is to summarize the definition, the radiological and morphological features of the UIP pattern in ARDs, together with risk factors, diagnostic criteria, prognostic evaluation, monitoring and management approaches of the UIP-ARDs.

### Comprehensive risk assessment for pulmonary manifestations in systemic lupus erythematosus: a large-scale Korean population-based longitudinal study [^116uox3D]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

The findings of our study have significant clinical and research implications. Clinically, the identification of a higher risk of pulmonary manifestations in SLE patients underscores the need for vigilant monitoring and early intervention strategies to manage and mitigate these risks. The particularly high risks of ILD and pulmonary hypertension suggest that these conditions should be prioritised in routine screenings and follow-up care for SLE patients. From a research perspective, our study highlights the importance of considering confounding factors such as smoking status, BMI and comorbidities in future investigations. Notably, our study is the first to involve a non-white population, providing valuable insights into the risk of pulmonary manifestations in a different cohort. The use of a large, population-based dataset with comprehensive adjustments for these variables provides a more accurate assessment of the true burden of pulmonary manifestations in SLE. Additionally, our findings call for further research into the mechanisms underlying the increased susceptibility to pulmonary manifestations in SLE patients and the development of targeted therapies to address these specific risks. Overall, our study contributes valuable insights that can inform both clinical practice and future research endeavours in the field of SLE and pulmonary health.

Our study has several limitations. First, the diagnoses of SLE, pulmonary manifestations and other comorbidities were based on ICD-10 codes, which may lead to overestimation or underestimation. To mitigate this issue, we adopted a conservative approach by using both ICD-10 codes and the RID programme registration code for SLE. Second, the absence of serological and radiologic data prevented us from including these factors in our analyses, highlighting the need for future studies to incorporate such data. Thus, we could not incorporate some important factors into our analyses. For example, we did not have information on the presence of autoantibodies, and thus, the impact of disease overlap (eg, coexisting Sjögren's disease) and antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular, antiphospholipid syndrome has been suggested to be important in the development of severe pulmonary manifestations such as ARDS, intra-alveolar haemorrhage, pulmonary embolism and pulmonary hypertension. Third, this study was conducted using a Korean dataset, and therefore, additional studies in other countries or among different ethnicities are necessary to generalise our findings.

In conclusion, the risk of pulmonary manifestation was approximately 3.3-fold higher in subjects with SLE compared with matched control cohort. In particular, the risks of ILD and pulmonary hypertension were relatively high compared with other pulmonary manifestations.

a Diagnosis of SLS made at the time of diagnosis of SLE

Shrinking lung syndrome is extremely rare in pediatric lupus patients (defined as 16 years or less at diagnosis), with only 6 well-documented case reports identified in our literature review from 1984 to 2019 (Table 2). Age at onset of SLS ranged from 12 to 15 years, 5 were female, all presented with dyspnea, and 5 had associated chest pain. Interestingly, 3 of the 6 presented at the time of diagnosis of SLE, a much more frequent occurrence than that reported in adults with SLS. Of the 6 patients, only 2 reported a return to baseline respiratory function, both clinically and documented on PFTs. In addition to these 6 patients, our literature review identified 3 patients with pediatric onset SLE who developed SLS at age 19 or 20. Some improvement in lung function was documented in 2 of these patients, one treated with IVMP, cyclophosphamide and azathioprine, and 1 treated with belimumab. In addition, 7 SLE patients 16–18 years of age have been reported, most in case series of SLS, however very limited information was given on their disease course.

Role of Chest Computed Tomography in Prevention of Occupational Respiratory Disease: Review of Recent Literature May 29 2015 Source: Semin Respir Crit Care Med. 36: 433–448. Details: Alternative Title: Semin Respir Crit Care Med Personal Author: Description: This review provides an update on literature published over the past 5 years that is relevant to using chest computed tomography as a tool for preventing occupational respiratory disease. An important area of investigation has been in the use of low-dose CT to screen asbestos-exposed populations for lung cancer.

Two recent systematic reviews have reached conclusions in support of screening. Based on the limited evidence that is currently available, the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health has recommended LDCT screening in asbestos-exposed individuals if their personal combination of risk factors yields a risk for lung cancer equal to that needed for entry into the National Lung Screening Trial. It has also recommended further research, such as to document the optimal frequency of screening and the effectiveness of screening. Recent literature continues to support high-resolution CT as being more sensitive than chest radiography in detecting pneumoconiosis. However, there are insufficient data to determine the effectiveness of HRCT screening in improving individual outcomes if used in screening for pneumoconiosis and its routine use for this purpose cannot be recommended.

However, if HRCT is used to evaluate populations, recent literature shows that the International Classification of HRCT for Occupational and Environmental Respiratory Diseases provides an important tool for reproducible evaluation and recording of findings. HRCT is an important tool for individual patient management and recent literature has documented that chest HRCT findings are significantly associated with outcomes such as pulmonary function and mortality.

### Spiral computed tomography for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in critically ill surgical patients… [^115iJ7EG]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Eleven patients had evidence of PE on PA, 5 in central and 6 in peripheral pulmonary arteries. The sensitivity and specificity of CTPA was, respectively, 45% and 82% for all PEs, 60% and 100% for central PEs, and 33% and 82% for peripheral PEs. Duplex scanning was 40% sensitive and 100% specific in diagnosing PE. The independent reviewers disagreed only in 14% of CTPA and 14% of PA interpretations. There were no differences in risk factors or clinical characteristics between patients with and without PE. The level of clinical suspicion was identical in the 2 groups. In this study, we evaluated the role of CTPA for diagnosis of PE in critically ill surgical patients. We prospectively compared CTPA with PA, the existing diagnostic gold standard. Our hypothesis is that CTPA's sensitivity and specificity are comparable with PA's.

If the hypothesis holds true, this less invasive and more convenient test can be used by clinicians at a lower threshold to diagnose PE among SICU patients, leading to detection and earlier treatment of thromboembolic events that might otherwise remain undiagnosed. However, of the 6 false-negative tests, 2 missed central pulmonary emboli. In all 8 tests there were substantial coexisting lung pathologic findings on CTPA. The sensitivity and specificity of CTPA to diagnose all PEs were 45% and 82%; central PEs, 60% and 100%; and peripheral PEs, 33% and 82%, respectively. Although the real positive predictive value of PA can only be demonstrated in animals or by autopsy findings, previous literature suggests that the incidence of false-positive findings is very low.

35, 36 Because we used only solid criteria, such as intraluminal filling defect or abrupt interruption of blood flow, to diagnose PE, we believe that PA reflected accurately the presence or absence of PE and, therefore, was justifiably used as the diagnostic gold standard. Anthony P. Borzotta, MD, Portland, Ore: The authors have attempted to define the role of spiral computed tomography of the chest in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in critically ill surgical patients, 77% of whom were victims of trauma. The patients underwent close surveillance for PE, yielding a higher incidence than expected, confirmed by using both spiral CT and pulmonary angiography in all cases.
