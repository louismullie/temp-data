## Question

What is hyperthyroidism?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what hyperthyroidism is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and how hyperthyroidism differs from thyrotoxicosis. Then, I should verify the pathophysiological mechanisms. Next, I will review epidemiology and common etiologies. After that, I need to check the clinical manifestations and complications. I will then examine diagnostic criteria and the initial workup, including when to use TRAb, uptake scanning, and ultrasound. Finally, I should consider special populations, especially pregnancy, and synthesize a concise, clinically useful definition with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the core definition so I don't conflate terms. Hyperthyroidism is a form of thyrotoxicosis characterized by inappropriately high synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland, leading to elevated tissue levels of thyroid hormone and suppressed TSH, whereas thyrotoxicosis is the broader clinical state of excess thyroid hormone action regardless of source, including exogenous intake or passive hormone release from thyroiditis [^c6d1fff2] [^438539da].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology before moving on. Mechanistically, hyperthyroidism arises from increased endogenous synthesis (e.g. Graves' disease with TSH receptor antibodies, toxic nodular disease with autonomous function), release of preformed hormone from destructive thyroiditis, or exogenous sources such as levothyroxine overdose or factitious ingestion; this mechanistic framing helps distinguish treatment-responsive causes from self-limited ones [^59509fb6] [^bd13491a].

> I should confirm the epidemiology next. In the United States, the prevalence of hyperthyroidism is about 1.2% overall, with 0.5% overt and 0.7% subclinical; globally, estimates range roughly 0.2–1.3%, and women are affected far more often than men, with female predominance on the order of 5–10:1 in many series, though I should note that exact ratios vary by population and ascertainment [^c6d1fff2] [^59509fb6] [^684a1a0f].

> Hold on, I should verify the leading etiologies so I don't overgeneralize. Graves' disease accounts for about 60–80% of hyperthyroidism in iodine-replete regions, followed by toxic multinodular goiter and toxic adenoma; other causes include subacute and painless thyroiditis, iodine- or amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis, and rare entities like TSH-secreting pituitary adenomas or struma ovarii, with drug-induced forms becoming more recognized in oncology and cardiology populations [^bd13491a] [^b71bc71f] [^6026655b].

> Let me consider the clinical picture and complications, and I need to ensure I capture age-related differences. Classic features include weight loss despite increased appetite, heat intolerance, diaphoresis, anxiety, tremor, tachycardia or atrial fibrillation, and goiter; older adults may present subtly with apathy, weight loss, or cardiovascular complications, and untreated hyperthyroidism increases risks of atrial fibrillation, embolic stroke, osteoporosis, and thyroid storm, which carries high mortality if unrecognized [^59509fb6] [^7b60209d] [^c07e40ed].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic criteria and initial testing so I don't miss a step. Biochemically, overt hyperthyroidism is defined by a suppressed TSH with elevated free T4 and/or T3, while subclinical hyperthyroidism has low TSH with normal free hormones; TSH has the highest sensitivity and specificity as a screening test, and small changes in free T4 produce large log-linear changes in TSH, which explains why TSH is often the earliest marker to shift [^2d92ae99] [^bb03addf].

> I will now examine how to determine etiology once hyperthyroidism is confirmed, and I should double-check the sequence. If the cause is not obvious clinically, measuring TSH receptor antibodies (TRAb) is accurate and cost-effective for diagnosing Graves' disease; if TRAb is negative or equivocal, radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) and thyroid scintigraphy help distinguish diffuse uptake (Graves') from focal uptake (toxic adenoma, toxic multinodular goiter) versus low uptake (thyroiditis), and thyroid ultrasound with Doppler can assess vascularity and nodules when needed [^53adfe0d] [^2877d25f] [^89507b893].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or planning pregnancy; I need to ensure safety and accuracy. In pregnancy, total T4 and T3 rise about 1.5-fold by the second trimester, so trimester-specific reference ranges are essential; TRAb should be measured when the etiology is uncertain or to assess fetal risk, and radioactive iodine is contraindicated in pregnancy, with antithyroid drug selection favoring methimazole generally, switching to propylthiouracil in the first trimester when appropriate and using the lowest effective dose with frequent monitoring [^3cfc065d] [^15c651bf] [^f78f5f49].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure internal consistency. Hyperthyroidism is the pathological state of excessive thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion by the thyroid gland, producing elevated circulating thyroid hormone levels, suppressed TSH, and a hypermetabolic clinical syndrome; it is a subset of thyrotoxicosis, most often due to Graves' disease, and requires etiologic diagnosis to guide definitive therapy among antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine, or surgery, with treatment tailored to age, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^c6d1fff2] [^438539da] [^bd13491a].

Hyperthyroidism is a condition of **excess thyroid hormone** [^59509fb6] causing a hypermetabolic state with symptoms such as weight loss, heat intolerance, palpitations, anxiety, and tremor [^a55902a1]. The most common cause is **Graves' disease** [^bd13491a]; other causes include toxic nodular disease, thyroiditis, and exogenous thyroid hormone [^6026655b]. Diagnosis relies on a **low TSH with elevated free T4/T3** [^2d92ae99]; TRAb confirms Graves' disease [^53adfe0d], and RAI uptake/scintigraphy distinguishes causes [^2877d25f]. Treatment options include antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine, or surgery [^39a1541d], with β-blockers for symptom control [^7a319328]; choice depends on etiology, age, comorbidities, and patient preference [^4df44fa0]. Untreated hyperthyroidism can cause atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, and thyroid storm [^7b60209d], so prompt recognition and therapy are essential [^bd13491a].

---

## Pathophysiology

Hyperthyroidism arises from **excess thyroid hormone** from increased synthesis (e.g. Graves' disease, toxic nodular disease) [^59509fb6], release of preformed hormone (e.g. thyroiditis) [^6026655b], or exogenous sources (e.g. levothyroxine overdose) [^5ba3bf9a]. Excess hormone increases metabolic rate and sensitivity to catecholamines, causing widespread effects [^b71bc71f].

---

## Etiology

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Autoimmune | Graves' disease (most common) [^bd13491a] |
| Nodular disease | Toxic multinodular goiter, toxic adenoma [^bd13491a] |
| Inflammatory | Subacute thyroiditis, painless thyroiditis [^bd13491a] |
| Exogenous | Factitious thyrotoxicosis, excessive levothyroxine [^5ba3bf9a] |
| Rare causes | TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma, struma ovarii, metastatic thyroid cancer [^6026655b] |

---

## Clinical manifestations

Hyperthyroidism presents with **multisystem features**; older adults may have subtle or atypical symptoms [^b71bc71f].

- **General**: weight loss despite increased appetite, heat intolerance, fatigue, sweating [^a55902a1].
- **Cardiovascular**: tachycardia, palpitations, atrial fibrillation, hypertension [^7b60209d].
- **Neurological**: anxiety, irritability, tremor, insomnia, hyperreflexia [^a55902a1].
- **Gastrointestinal**: diarrhea, increased frequency [^a55902a1].
- **Musculoskeletal**: muscle weakness, proximal myopathy, osteoporosis [^cb1368b6].
- **Dermatological**: warm, moist skin, hair thinning, onycholysis [^notfound].
- **Reproductive**: menstrual irregularities, decreased fertility [^notfound].
- **Ocular**: exophthalmos, ophthalmoplegia, conjunctival injection (Graves' ophthalmopathy) [^e274fd53].

---

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is **biochemical**, supported by clinical assessment and targeted testing [^bd13491a].

- **Initial tests**: serum TSH (suppressed), free T4, and total T3 [^2d92ae99].
- **Confirmatory tests**: TRAb for Graves' disease [^53adfe0d]; RAI uptake/scintigraphy to distinguish causes [^2877d25f].
- **Imaging**: thyroid ultrasound for nodules or goiter [^notfound].

---

## Treatment

Treatment is **individualized** by etiology, severity, age, comorbidities, and patient preference [^4df44fa0].

- **Antithyroid drugs**: methimazole (preferred), propylthiouracil (first trimester or intolerance) [^notfound].
- **Radioactive iodine**: definitive therapy for Graves' disease and toxic nodular disease [^notfound].
- **Surgery**: thyroidectomy for large goiters, suspicion of cancer, or intolerance to other therapies [^fa36d5d0].
- **Symptomatic therapy**: β-blockers for adrenergic symptoms [^7a319328].

---

## Complications

Untreated hyperthyroidism can cause **significant morbidity and mortality** [^7b60209d].

- **Cardiovascular**: atrial fibrillation, heart failure, embolic events [^59509fb6].
- **Skeletal**: osteoporosis, increased fracture risk [^cb1368b6].
- **Neuropsychiatric**: anxiety, depression, cognitive impairment [^acc18f05].
- **Endocrine**: thyroid storm (life-threatening) [^c07e40ed].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **generally excellent** with appropriate treatment [^bd13491a]; recurrence is common after antithyroid drug withdrawal, and lifelong thyroid hormone replacement is often needed after radioactive iodine or surgery [^bd13491a]. Persistent hyperthyroidism increases mortality, particularly from cardiovascular disease [^notfound].

---

Hyperthyroidism is a **treatable endocrine disorder** characterized by excess thyroid hormone; early diagnosis and etiology-specific therapy prevent serious complications and improve outcomes [^bd13491a].

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^4ada3aa4]. Thyroid (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Thyrotoxicosis has multiple etiologies, manifestations, and potential therapies. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions and patient preference. This document describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of thyrotoxicosis that would be useful to generalist and subspecialty physicians and others providing care for patients with this condition.

Methods

The American Thyroid Association (ATA) previously cosponsored guidelines for the management of thyrotoxicosis that were published in 2011. Considerable new literature has been published since then, and the ATA felt updated evidence-based guidelines were needed. The association assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this report. They examined relevant literature using a systematic PubMed search supplemented with additional published materials. An evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated the knowledge and experience of the panel was used to update the 2011 text and recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting them were rated according to the approach recommended by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Group.

Results

Clinical topics addressed include the initial evaluation and management of thyrotoxicosis; management of Graves' hyperthyroidism using radioactive iodine, antithyroid drugs, or surgery; management of toxic multinodular goiter or toxic adenoma using radioactive iodine or surgery; Graves' disease in children, adolescents, or pregnant patients; subclinical hyperthyroidism; hyperthyroidism in patients with Graves' orbitopathy; and management of other miscellaneous causes of thyrotoxicosis. New paradigms since publication of the 2011 guidelines are presented for the evaluation of the etiology of thyrotoxicosis, the management of Graves' hyperthyroidism with antithyroid drugs, the management of pregnant hyperthyroid patients, and the preparation of patients for thyroid surgery. The sections on less common causes of thyrotoxicosis have been expanded.

Conclusions

One hundred twenty-four evidence-based recommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with thyrotoxicosis and to share what the task force believes is current, rational, and optimal medical practice.

Rating of the recommendations — GRADE approach and strength labels: The task force elected to rate the recommendations according to the system developed by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (Group). The strength of a recommendation is indicated as a strong recommendation (for or against) that applies to most patients in most circumstances with benefits of action clearly outweighing the risks and burdens (or vice versa), or a weak recommendation or a suggestion that may not be appropriate for every patient, depending on context, patient values, and preferences, and the quality of evidence is indicated as low-quality evidence, moderate-quality evidence, or high-quality evidence. In several instances, the evidence was insufficient to recommend for or against a test or a treatment, and the task force made a statement labeled "no recommendation", and each recommendation is preceded by a description of the evidence and, in some cases, followed by a remarks section including technical suggestions on issues such as dosing and monitoring.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^4df44fa0]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association 2016 — treatment selection principles for hyperthyroidism emphasize shared decision-making, practicality, and surgical expertise: The long-term quality of life (QoL) following treatment for Graves' disease was found to be the same in patients randomly allocated to one of the three treatment options, and no scientific evidence exists to support the recommendation of alternative therapies for the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Technical remarks state that once the diagnosis has been made, the treating physician and patient should discuss each of the treatment options and the selection should also take into account the local availability and the associated costs; when surgery is selected one should consider use of expert high-volume thyroid surgeons who on average have low rates of complications, and lack of that expertise should be considered against the known risk of alternative choices. Long-term continuous treatment of hyperthyroidism with ATDs may be considered in selected cases.

### Hyperthyroidism (primary) [^684a1a0f]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hyperthyroidism is characterised by high levels of serum thyroxine and triiodothyronine, and low levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone. The main causes of hyperthyroidism are Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goitre, and toxic adenoma. About 20 times more women than men have hyperthyroidism.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of drug treatments for primary hyperthyroidism? What are the effects of surgical treatments for primary hyperthyroidism? What are the effects of treatments for subclinical hyperthyroidism? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to February 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 15 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: adding thyroxine to antithyroid drugs (carbimazole, propylthiouracil, and thiamazole), antithyroid drugs (carbimazole, propylthiouracil, and thiamazole), radioactive iodine, and thyroidectomy.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^f742aa6e]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical thyroid diseases — subclinical hyperthyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism — are common clinical entities that encompass mild degrees of thyroid dysfunction. The clinical significance of mild thyroid overactivity and underactivity is uncertain, which has led to controversy over the appropriateness of diagnostic testing and possible treatment. In this Seminar, we discuss the definition, epidemiology, differential diagnoses, risks of progression to overt thyroid disease, potential effects on various health outcomes, and management of subclinical hyperthyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism. Treatment recommendations are based on the degree to which thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations have deviated from normal and underlying comorbidities. Large-scale randomised trials are urgently needed to inform how to best care for individuals with subclinical thyroid disease.

### Propylthiouracil [^09da8278]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

If you get pregnant while taking Propylthiouracil, call your doctor right away about your therapy.

What is Propylthiouracil?

Propylthiouracil is a prescription medicine used to treat people who have Graves' disease with hyperthyroidism or toxic multinodular goiter. Propylthiouracil is used when:

certain other antithyroid medicines do not work well.
thyroid surgery or radioactive iodine therapy is not a treatment option.
to decrease symptoms of hyperthyroidism in preparation for a thyroidectomy (removal of the thyroid gland) or radioactive iodine therapy.

Propylthiouracil is not recommended for use in children.

Who should not take Propylthiouracil?

Do not take Propylthiouracil if you are allergic to Propylthiouracil or any of its ingredients. See the end of this Medication Guide for a complete list of ingredients in Propylthiouracil.

What should I tell my doctor before taking Propylthiouracil?

Before you take Propylthiouracil, tell your doctor if you:

plan to have surgery.
have any other medical conditions
are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Talk to your doctor right away if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Propylthiouracil may harm or cause death of your unborn baby.
are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed. Propylthiouracil can pass into your breast milk. Talk to your doctor about the best way to feed your baby if you take Propylthiouracil.

### Hyperthyroidism: a review [^59509fb6]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyperthyroidism:

- **Definition**: Hyperthyroidism is a pathological syndrome in which tissue is exposed to excessive amounts of circulating thyroid hormone.
- **Pathophysiology**: Causes of hyperthyroidism include increased synthesis of thyroid hormones (e.g. Grave's disease), release of preformed thyroid hormones due to destruction of thyroid tissue (e.g., thyroiditis), and exogenous thyroid hormone intake.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of hyperthyroidism is estimated at 13,000 per 100,000 population. In Europe, the prevalence of hyperthyroidism is estimated at 800 per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: Hyperthyroidism leads to a higher incidence of AF and atrial flutter, and, at least partly by that mechanism, a higher risk of cerebral arterial thrombosis. Hyperthyroidism additionally leads to increased bone turnover and a negative bone balance.

### Hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis [^60c2a9e8]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis are hypermetabolic conditions that cause significant morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis can be difficult because symptoms can mimic many other disease states leading to inaccurate or untimely diagnoses and management. Thyroid storm is the most severe form of thyrotoxicosis, hallmarked by altered sensorium, and, if untreated, is associated with significant mortality. Thyroid storm should be considered in the differential of any patient presenting with altered mental status. The emergency medicine physician who can rapidly recognize thyrotoxicosis, identify the precipitating event, appropriately and comprehensively begin medical management, and facilitate disposition will undoubtedly save a life.

Regarding medical management for hyperthyroidism, more specifically with respect to management of subclinical hyperthyroidism, ATA 2016 guidelines recommend to treat subclinical hyperthyroidism when TSH is persistently < 0.1 mU/L in the following clinical settings:

- patients ≥ 65 years of age

- patients with cardiac risk factors, heart disease or osteoporosis

- postmenopausal women who are not on estrogens or bisphosphonates

- patients with symptoms.

### How should we treat patients with low serum thyrotropin concentrations? [^d4cafc0d]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined by a low serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration in the presence of normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3). However, it is helpful to distinguish between those with a detectable but low TSH value (in the 0.1–0.4 mU/l range) and those with a fully suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/l), and we suggest the designation of grade I and grade II SH, respectively. Together, these patterns of thyroid function tests are found in 1–3% of the elderly population, and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in longitudinal epidemiological surveys. There are a number of causes for this picture, which include endogenous thyroid disease, drug effects and concomitant nonthyroidal illness. Treatments commonly employed in the management of thyrotoxicosis are effective at correcting the biochemical abnormalities of SH but have not been shown to improve clinical outcome or symptoms. There is little good quality evidence available to guide the assessment or management of these patients. This review summarizes the clinical significance of SH and aims to provide guidance about whether we should treat patients with low serum TSH concentrations.

### Hyperthyroidism, bone mineral, and fracture risk – a meta-analysis [^cb1368b6]. Thyroid (2003). Low credibility.

This study examined changes in bone mineral and fracture risk after treatment for hyperthyroidism in a meta-analysis. The PubMed and EMBASE were searched using the MESH terms "hyperthyroidism", "bone mineral density" (BMD), and "fracture", resulting in retrieval of 289 references. Twenty references describing BMD and five describing fracture risk were included in the meta-analysis. BMD was significantly decreased in patients with untreated hyperthyroidism. Upon treatment BMD increased significantly and reversed to normal levels with a temporary increase above normal levels 1–4 years after diagnosis. The risk of hip fractures increased significantly with age at diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. The hip fracture risk after diagnosis predicted from studies on BMD was close to that observed in clinical studies comparing fracture risk in hyperthyroid patients with normal controls. Thus BMD is significantly decreased and fracture risk increased in untreated hyperthyroidism. Upon normalization of the hyperthyroid state BMD return to normal even though no specific antiosteoporotic measures are taken other than normalizing the hyperthyroid state.

Determination of etiology (Recommendation 1) — The etiology of thyrotoxicosis should be determined. If the diagnosis is not apparent based on the clinical presentation and initial biochemical evaluation, diagnostic testing is indicated and can include, depending on available expertise and resources, (1) measurement of TRAb, (2) determination of the radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU), or (3) measurement of thyroidal blood flow on ultrasonography. A 123I or 99mTc pertechnetate scan should be obtained when the clinical presentation suggests a TA or TMNG. Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.

### The thyroid – too much and too little across the ages. the consequences of subclinical thyroid dysfunction [^2e1d0674]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Mild thyroid dysfunction is common, and more prevalent than overt hyper- and hypothyroidism. Subclinical (mild) thyroid dysfunction is a biochemical entity characterized by an abnormality of serum TSH associated with normal serum thyroid hormone concentrations. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is thus defined as low or suppressed serum TSH with normal serum-free T4 and T3, while subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as raised serum TSH with normal circulating T4. These biochemical abnormalities are part of the much wider spectrum of thyroid dysfunction which includes overt hyperthyroidism and overt hypothyroidism, but by no means always indicate underlying thyroid disease. There is much debate about the significance of mild abnormalities of thyroid function in terms of symptoms and potential associations with long-term morbidity and mortality and hence much debate about whether to screen for these abnormalities, and, once identified, whether to treat or monitor, and if so, how? Our knowledge base has increased significantly in recent years, principally because studies of large cohorts have begun to define the epidemiology and associations of mild thyroid dysfunction (including short-term and long-term outcomes) and a small but increasing number of randomized-controlled intervention studies have been reported. There is, however, much to learn about these disorders and, given their prevalence, their impact on health.

### Hyperthyroidism: diagnosis and treatment… [^b71bc71f]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical hyperthyroidism, also called thyrotoxicosis, is caused by the effects of excess thyroid hormone and can be triggered by different disorders. Etiologic diagnosis influences prognosis and therapy. The prevalence of hyperthyroidism in community-based studies has been estimated at 2 percent for women and 0. 2 percent for men. 1 As many as 15 percent of cases of hyperthyroidism occur in patients older than 60 years.
2. Clinical Presentation Hyperthyroidism presents with multiple symptoms that vary according to the age of the patient, duration of illness, magnitude of hormone excess, and presence of comorbid conditions. Symptoms are related to the thyroid hormone's stimulation of catabolic enzymopathic activity and catabolism, and enhancement of sensitivity to catecholamines. Common symptoms and signs are listed in. Table 1, 3 with attention to the differences in clinical presentation between younger and older patients.

Older patients often present with a paucity of classic signs and symptoms, which can make the diagnosis more difficult. 4 Thyroid storm is a rare presentation of hyperthyroidism that may occur after a stressful illness in a patient with untreated or undertreated hyperthyroidism and is characterized by delirium, severe tachycardia, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration.
5. GRAVES' DISEASE Graves' disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism, accounting for 60 to 80 percent of all cases. 8 It is an autoimmune disease caused by an antibody, active against the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor, which stimulates the gland to synthesize and secrete excess thyroid hormone. It can be familial and associated with other autoimmune diseases. An infiltrative ophthalmopathy accompanies Graves' disease in about 50 percent of patients.
9.

5 Thyroid hormone-induced Factitial hyperthyroidism is caused by the intentional or accidental ingestion of excess amounts of thyroid hormone. Some patients may take thyroid preparations to achieve weight loss. TUMORS Rare causes of hyperthyroidism include metastatic thyroid cancer, ovarian tumors that produce thyroid hormone, trophoblastic tumors that produce human chorionic gonadotrophin and activate highly sensitive TSH receptors, and TSH-secreting pituitary tumors.
5. Nonspecific laboratory findings can occur in hyperthyroidism, including anemia, granulocytosis, lymphocytosis, hypercalcemia, transaminase elevations, and alkaline phosphatase elevation. 5.

Introduction — thyrotoxicosis definitions, treatment scope, and U.S. epidemiology: Thyrotoxicosis refers to a clinical state that results from inappropriately high thyroid hormone action in tissues generally due to inappropriately high tissue thyroid hormone levels, and hyperthyroidism is a form of thyrotoxicosis due to inappropriately high synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormone(s) by the thyroid. β-blockers may be used in almost all forms of thyrotoxicosis, whereas antithyroid drugs (ATDs) are useful only in some. In the United States, the prevalence of hyperthyroidism is approximately 1.2% (0.5% overt and 0.7% subclinical); the most common causes include Graves' disease (GD), toxic multinodular goiter (TMNG), and toxic adenoma (TA).

### Hyperthyroidism and clinical depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^acc18f05]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism and clinical depression are common, and there is preliminary evidence of substantial comorbidity. The extent of the association in the general population, however, has not yet been estimated meta-analytically. Therefore we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis (registered in PROSPERO: CRD42020164791). Until May 2020, Medline (via PubMed), PsycINFO, and Embase databases were systematically searched for studies on the association of hyperthyroidism and clinical depression, without language or date restrictions. Two reviewers independently selected epidemiological studies providing laboratory or ICD-based diagnoses of hyperthyroidism and diagnoses of depression according to operationalized criteria (e.g. DSM) or to cut-offs in established rating scales. All data, including study quality based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, were independently extracted by two authors. Odds ratios for the association of clinical depression and hyperthyroidism were calculated in a DerSimonian-Laird random-effects meta-analysis. Out of 3372 papers screened we selected 15 studies on 239 608 subjects, with 61% women and a mean age of 50. Relative to euthyroid individuals, patients with hyperthyroidism had a higher chance of being diagnosed with clinical depression: OR 1.67 ([95% CI: 1.49; 1.87], I²: 6%; prediction interval: 1.40 to 1.99), a result supported in a number of sensitivity and subgroup analyses. The OR was slightly less pronounced for subclinical as opposed to overt hyperthyroidism (1.36 [1.06; 1.74] vs. 1.70 [1.49; 1.93]). This comorbidity calls for clinical awareness and its reasons need investigation and may include neurobiological mechanisms, common genetic vulnerability and a generally heightened risk for clinical depression in patients with chronic somatic disorders.

### Hyperthyroidism and clinical depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^62d98064]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

In regard to therapy, both conditions, hyperthyroidism and depression, demand guideline-oriented treatment. We are not aware of an established treatment that would target the two diseases in one approach.

Hyperthyroidism is not as prevalent as hypothyroidism in the general population. Assuming a population of 332.5 million people in the US, a hyperthyroidism prevalence of 1.3%, and a 12-months depression prevalence of 6.7%, an OR of 1.67 translates into about 484 thousand people with the comorbidity, 194 thousand of those presumably due to hyperthyroidism. Provided that there are 22.3 million people with depression each year, in a model assuming that hyperthyroidism causes depression, hyperthyroidism contributes about 0.9% to the pandemic of depression.

We focussed on population-based studies, but the term leaves some room for debate: For example, a sample of civil servants, such as the one investigated by Benseñor et al. is not population-based in the strict sense. However, while it is likely that prevalence differs contingent on the sample, it seems implausible that the association between hyperthyroidism and depression differs meaningfully in such a large and diverse group of people. Reassuringly, sensitivity analysis restricted to strictly population-based studies yielded no substantially different results (Supplementary Table 2). In the same vein, exclusion of register studies did not substantially change the summary estimate.

In conclusion, there is an association of hyperthyroidism with clinical depression (1.67 [95% CI: 1.49–1.87]), that is stronger in overt than in subclinical hyperthyroidism, pointing to a possibly biological association of both conditions. This should raise awareness in clinicians and researchers alike: Not only hypothyroid but also, and especially, hyperthyroid patients are at higher risk for depressive disorders and should be monitored for signs of clinical depression. How a hyperthyroid metabolism influences mood is not yet explained and, particularly regarding sex, deserves greater attention in the future research of thyroid–brain interactions.

### Hyperthyroidism: diagnosis and treatment [^fa36d5d0]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

The proper treatment of hyperthyroidism depends on recognition of the signs and symptoms of the disease and determination of the etiology. The most common cause of hyperthyroidism is Graves' disease. Other common causes include thyroiditis, toxic multinodular goiter, toxic adenomas, and side effects of certain medications. The diagnostic workup begins with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level test. When test results are uncertain, measuring radionuclide uptake helps distinguish among possible causes. When thyroiditis is the cause, symptomatic treatment usually is sufficient because the associated hyperthyroidism is transient. Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and toxic adenoma can be treated with radioactive iodine, antithyroid drugs, or surgery, but in the United States, radioactive iodine is the treatment of choice in patients without contraindications. Thyroidectomy is an option when other treatments fail or are contraindicated, or when a goiter is causing compressive symptoms. Some new therapies are under investigation. Special treatment consideration must be given to patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, as well as those with Graves' ophthalmopathy or amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism. Patients' desires must be considered when deciding on appropriate therapy, and dose monitoring is essential.

### Hyperthyroidism and clinical depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^affc2f71]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis investigating both subclinical and overt hyperthyroidism and its association with clinical depression in the general population. We found a statistically significant association of hyperthyroidism and depression, with small confidence as well as prediction intervals indicating a robust effect. The results are supported by a variety of subgroup as well as sensitivity analyses and by low heterogeneity. Therefore, even though fewer studies have been carried out on hyper- than on hypothyroidism (OR: 1.30 [1.08–1.57]), we consider the evidence of an association with clinical depression and the effect itself marginally stronger in hyperthyroidism (OR 1.67 [1.49–1.87]).

These findings challenge earlier research on hyperthyroidism and depression: Wildisen et al. for example, reported no relevant effect of subclinical hyperthyroidism on BDI-scores. However, they did not analyse patients with overt hyperthyroidism. Of note, more in line with Wildisen and co-authors' study, our results point to a weaker, if any, association of subclinical hyperthyroidism with clinical depression than in overt hyperthyroidism.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism with TSH persistently below the lower limit of normal but ≥ 0.1 mU/L — observation is acceptable for asymptomatic patients under age 65 without cardiac disease or osteoporosis, who can be observed without further investigation of the etiology of the subnormal TSH or treatment (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). In this range, treatment should be considered for older subjects, but it is not recommended for subjects < 65 years of age; younger subjects should be monitored at regular 6- to 12-month intervals, and treatment should be considered if the TSH persistently decreases to < 0.1 mU/L. In patients with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, a trial of β-adrenergic blocking agents may be useful to determine whether symptomatic therapy might suffice.

### Update on subclinical hyperthyroidism [^8a233701]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by low or undetectable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, with normal free thyroxine and total or free triiodothyronine levels. It can be caused by increased endogenous production of thyroid hormone (as in Graves disease or toxic nodular goiter), administration of thyroid hormone for treatment of malignant thyroid disease, or unintentional excessive thyroid hormone therapy. The rate of progression to overt hyperthyroidism is higher in persons who have suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone levels compared with those who have low but detectable levels. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation in older adults, and with decreased bone mineral density in postmenopausal women; however, the effectiveness of treatment in preventing these conditions is unknown. There is lesser-quality evidence suggesting an association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and other cardiovascular effects, including increased heart rate and left ventricular mass, and increased bone turnover markers. Possible associations between subclinical hyperthyroidism and quality of life parameters, cognition, and increased mortality rates are controversial. Prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to address the effects of early treatment on potential morbidities to help determine whether screening should be recommended in the asymptomatic general population.

### New therapeutic horizons for Graves' hyperthyroidism [^e00511a7]. Endocrine Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Conventional treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism with surgery, radioiodine, or antithyroid drugs has not substantially changed since the late 1940s. An abundance of new therapeutic approaches, involving biologic, small molecule, and peptide immunomodulation are currently at different stages of development and several will translate into the clinic over the next few years. These therapies may render destructive radioiodine thyroid ablation and thyroidectomy obsolete treatments of historical interest, although the advantages of restoring a euthyroid state without the need for ongoing therapy will need to be balanced against potential risks such as immunocompromise. Future studies need to focus on understanding the most effective combinations of the conventional medical and surgical therapies with these recently introduced options.

### Hyperthyroidism: aetiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, management, complications, and prognosis [^bd13491a]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Hyperthyroidism is a common condition with a global prevalence of 0·2–1·3%. When clinical suspicion of hyperthyroidism arises, it should be confirmed by biochemical tests (eg, low TSH, high free thyroxine [FT₄], or high free tri-iodothyonine [FT₃]). If hyperthyroidism is confirmed by biochemical tests, a nosological diagnosis should be done to find out which disease is causing the hyperthyroidism. Helpful tools are TSH-receptor antibodies, thyroid peroxidase antibodies, thyroid ultrasonography, and scintigraphy. Hyperthyroidism is mostly caused by Graves' hyperthyroidism (70%) or toxic nodular goitre (16%). Hyperthyroidism can also be caused by subacute granulomatous thyroiditis (3%) and drugs (9%) such as amiodarone, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Disease-specific recommendations are given. Currently, Graves' hyperthyroidism is preferably treated with antithyroid drugs. However, recurrence of hyperthyroidism after a 12–18 month course of antithyroid drugs occurs in approximately 50% of patients. Being younger than 40 years, having FT₄ concentrations that are 40 pmol/L or higher, having TSH-binding inhibitory immunoglobulins that are higher than 6 U/L, and having a goitre size that is equivalent to or larger than WHO grade 2 before the start of treatment with antithyroid drugs increase risk of recurrence. Long-term treatment with antithyroid drugs (ie, 5–10 years of treatment) is feasible and associated with fewer recurrences (15%) than short-term treatment (ie, 12–18 months of treatment). Toxic nodular goitre is mostly treated with radioiodine (¹³¹I) or thyroidectomy and is rarely treated with radiofrequency ablation. Destructive thyrotoxicosis is usually mild and transient, requiring steroids only in severe cases. Specific attention is given to patients with hyperthyroidism who are pregnant, have COVID-19, or have other complications (eg, atrial fibrillation, thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, and thyroid storm). Hyperthyroidism is associated with increased mortality. Prognosis might be improved by rapid and sustained control of hyperthyroidism. Innovative new treatments are expected for Graves' disease, by targeting B cells or TSH receptors.

TSHR-specific modalities

As the direct cause of hyperthyroidism in Graves' disease is stimulation of the TSHR, several groups have been developing approaches that directly prevent TSHR signaling, either through small molecules or by using antibodies that block receptor activation. Furthermore, TSHR peptides are being investigated to see if they may have long-lasting immunomodulatory properties. A key advantage of this strategy when compared to the immunomodulatory strategies described above is their more specific, targeted approach which — from a theoretical standpoint — is unlikely to have a deleterious impact on the patient's ability to fight infection.

Thyrotoxicosis background and etiologies — In general, thyrotoxicosis can occur if (i) the thyroid is inappropriately stimulated by trophic factors; (ii) there is constitutive activation of thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion leading to autonomous release of excess thyroid hormone; (iii) thyroid stores of preformed hormone are passively released in excessive amounts owing to autoimmune, infectious, chemical, or mechanical insult; or (iv) there is exposure to extra-thyroidal sources of thyroid hormone, which may be either endogenous (struma ovarii, metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer) or exogenous (factitious thyrotoxicosis). Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined as a low or undetectable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with values within the normal reference range for both triiodothyronine (T3) and free thyroxine (T4) estimates and is most often caused by release of excess thyroid hormone by the gland. GD is an autoimmune disorder in which thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAbs) stimulate the TSH receptor, increasing thyroid hormone production. The natural history of nodular thyroid disease includes growth of established nodules, new nodule formation, and development of autonomy over time, and in TAs autonomous hormone production can be caused by somatic activating mutations of genes regulating thyroid hormone synthesis; germline mutations in the gene encoding the TSH receptor can cause sporadic or familial nonautoimmune hyperthyroidism.

### Definition of hyperthyroidism-NCI dictionary of cancer… [^a55902a1]. NCI (2011). Low credibility.

hyperthyroidism A condition that occurs when the thyroid gland makes more thyroid hormones than the body needs. Thyroid hormones control the way the body uses energy and affect the body's metabolism. Hyperthyroidism may be caused by an autoimmune disorder called Graves' disease, benign lumps in the thyroid gland, and inflammation of the thyroid gland. It may also be caused by consuming too much iodine in the diet or by taking too much thyroid hormone medicine. Signs and symptoms include weight loss, fatigue, rapid or irregular heartbeat, sweating, diarrhea, nervousness, mood swings, shaky hands, trouble sleeping, trouble tolerating heat, muscle weakness, and a goiter. Hyperthyroidism can usually be controlled with treatment. Also called overactive thyroid.

### Cancer risk after radioactive iodine treatment for hyperthyroidism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^907516b6]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Hyperthyroidism, a form of thyrotoxicosis, is a clinical state characterized by inappropriately high tissue thyroid hormone levels. The prevalence of hyperthyroidism ranges from 0.1% to 2.9% worldwideand is approximately 1.2% (0.5% overt and 0.7% subclinical) in the United States. The most common causes include Graves disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and toxic adenoma.

Radioactive iodine (RAI) has been used to treat hyperthyroidism for more than 7 decades. According to the American Thyroid Association guidelines, RAI therapy has been strongly recommended with moderate-quality evidence as 1 of the 3 major treatments (ie, RAI, antithyroid drugs, and thyroidectomy) for patients with overt Graves hyperthyroidism. RAI treatment is preferred in situations in which greater value is placed on the definitive control of hyperthyroidism, the avoidance of surgery, and the potential adverse effects of antithyroid drugs, and a lower value is placed on the need for lifelong thyroid hormone replacement and the rapid resolution of hyperthyroidism. The European Thyroid Association guidelines also recommend RAI therapy to be considered for patients who prefer this approach.

However, the extensive use of RAI therapy has raised concerns regarding its potential carcinogenic and leukemogenic effects. RAI therapy for thyroid cancer, and for hyperthyroidism, has been associated with an increased risk of subsequent malignant neoplasms, whereas other studies, have reported no associations. However, a recent study by Kitahara et al, showing a dose-response association between RAI treatment and the risk of cancer death, has challenged the notion that RAI therapy for hyperthyroidism does not have long-term adverse effects.

Previously, a systematic review and meta-analysis reported the cancer risks after RAI exposure for hyperthyroidism. Several studies for RAI therapy for hyperthyroidism and subsequent cancer risk were published thereafter. Most, but not all, of these studies were summarized in a 2020 narrative reviewdescribing the association between RAI therapy for hyperthyroidism and cancer risk. However, to our knowledge, there have been no systematic reviews or meta-analyses summarizing the dose-response association of RAI therapy for hyperthyroidism with subsequent cancer risk. In addition, a new quality assessment tool for radiation epidemiology studies was recommended by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), but it has yet to be applied in a systemic review of RAI treatment studies. Therefore, an updated systematic review of the evidence on cancer risks following RAI therapy for hyperthyroidism is warranted.

5 CONCLUSIONS

This is one of only a few studies to report on the characteristics of patients with hyperthyroidism in a UK population managed in an outpatient setting. We present some interesting findings showing the likely clinical response rates to various established treatment modalities. This is intended to aid clinicians counsel patients about benefits and risks of available treatment options and to help guide patients on often difficult treatment choices. In our opinion, this study should encourage the use of accurate record keeping and collection of real world data, facilitating the conduction of now mandatory specialist peer reviews in secondary care endocrine clinics.

Conclusions

Hyperthyroid treatment decisions should take into consideration the balance of risks with advantages of each available treatment option as well as patient preference, health status, and access to these options. We believe the results of this study provide quantitative estimates of the risks of radiation-associated cancer deaths in RAI-treated patients with hyperthyroidism, which were previously not well understood, and suggest that the risk of death from solid cancer (including breast cancer) increases with the greater absorbed dose to exposed organs and tissues. Additional studies are needed to fully weigh the risks and advantages of RAI and other major treatment options available to patients with hyperthyroidism.

### New therapeutic horizons for Graves' hyperthyroidism [^399fe6b2]. Endocrine Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Graves' hyperthyroidism is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies that stimulate the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), resulting in uncontrolled secretion of excessive thyroid hormone. Conventional treatments, including antithyroid medication, radioiodine, or surgery have remained largely unchanged for the past 70 years and either lack efficacy for many patients, or result in lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy, in the case of the latter 2 options. The demand for new therapeutic options, combined with greater insight into basic immunobiology, has led to the emergence of novel approaches to treat Graves' hyperthyroidism. The current therapies under investigation include biologics, small molecules, and peptide immunomodulation. There is a growing focus on TSHR-specific treatment modalities, which carry the advantage of eliciting a specific, targeted approach, with the aim of avoiding disruption of the functioning immune system. These therapies present a new opportunity to supersede the inadequate treatments currently available for some Graves' patients, offering hope of successful restoration of euthyroidism without the need for ongoing therapy. Several of these therapeutic options have the potential to translate into clinical practice in the near future. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the recent advances and various stages of development of the novel therapeutic approaches to treat Graves' hyperthyroidism.

VA/DoD obesity guideline — thyroid manipulation and weight: Normalization of the hyperthyroid state is associated with a weight gain of approximately 7 kg. Treatment of euthyroid patients to hyperthyroid levels has not been reported outside of control groups in early phase clinical trials. The risks associated with hyperthyroidism — particularly cardiac, ocular, bone, and neuropsychiatric — make intentional creation of a hyperthyroid state highly inadvisable for weight loss. Hyperthyroidism (e.g. Grave's disease) is a condition that requires treatment to avoid negative health consequences, and iatrogenic hyperthyroidism accrues significant harm.

Hyperthyroidism — etiology, complications, and defining laboratory pattern are outlined, noting that overt thyrotoxicosis is characterized by excess thyroid hormones in serum and suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (< 0.01 mU/L). Painless thyroiditis accounts for about 10% of hyperthyroid cases and occurs in 5–10% of amiodarone-treated patients, while remission of GD has been reported in up to 30% of patients without treatment. Complications of untreated thyrotoxicosis include loss of weight, osteoporosis, atrial fibrillation, embolic events, and even cardiovascular collapse and death, and symptoms such as tachycardia and anxiety appear more pronounced in younger patients and those with larger goiters.

Subclinical thyroid diseases are defined by abnormal serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels associated with normal thyroid hormone concentrations. The diagnosis of these conditions depends on defining the 'normal' euthyroid TSH range; in this review, arguments for and against lowering the upper limit of TSH are summarised. Although, subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism are frequently encountered, their long-term consequences are debated due to conflicting results from many observational studies. The causes, effects and outcomes of treatment of both subclinical diseases are described, and the direction of future research in these conditions is outlined.

Hyperthyroidism in pregnancy — treatment uncertainties, medication risks, and screening debate — remains unresolved, with concern for teratogenicity and severity-dependent risks. Studies have recently questioned the optimal treatment of hyperthyroidism during pregnancy; reports have detailed the potential teratogenic effects of the antithyroid medications methimazole (MMI) and propylthiouracil (PTU), and while mild hyperthyroidism appears safe for the mother and fetus, moderate to severe hyperthyroidism can prove dangerous. Regarding screening, many have suggested universally evaluating thyroid function in all women either before or during pregnancy, yet to date studies appear to show mixed conclusions.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^2d92ae99]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism — biochemical evaluation states that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test in suspected hyperthyroidism and should be used as an initial screening test; when hyperthyroidism is strongly suspected, diagnostic accuracy improves when both a serum TSH and free T4 are assessed at the initial evaluation. The relationship between free T4 and TSH is an inverse log-linear relationship, so small changes in free T4 result in large changes in serum TSH, and serum TSH levels are considerably more sensitive than direct thyroid hormone measurements for assessing excess. In overt hyperthyroidism, both serum free T4 and T3 estimates are usually elevated and serum TSH is undetectable, whereas in milder hyperthyroidism serum T4 and free T4 can be normal, only serum T3 may be elevated, and serum TSH will be < 0.01 mU/L (or undetectable), a pattern called "T3-toxicosis"; assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated than those for free T4, so measurement of total T3 is frequently preferred in clinical practice.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) with TSH persistently below the lower limit of normal but ≥ 0.1 mU/L — treatment of SH should be considered in individuals ≥ 65 years of age and in patients with cardiac disease or symptoms of hyperthyroidism (2/+00). Persistence in this range is defined as a TSH level between 0.1 and 0.5 mU/L on repeated measurement over a 3–6-month period; the thyroid disorder underlying SH should be diagnosed to avoid treating transient, functional disorders related to acute illness, drugs, and other causes of low TSH. In symptomatic patients, a trial of beta-adrenergic blockers may be useful to determine whether symptomatic therapy might suffice.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: current concepts and scintigraphic imaging [^7237f4b0]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as normal serum free thyroxine and a free triiodothyronine level, with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level suppressed below the normal range and is usually undetectable. Although patients with this diagnosis have no or few signs and symptoms of overt thyrotoxicosis, there is sufficient evidence that it is associated with a relatively higher risk of supraventricular arrhythmias as well as the acceleration or the development of osteoporosis. Consequently, the approach to the patient with subclinical hyperthyroidism is controversial, that is, therapeutic intervention versus watchful waiting. Regardless, it is imperative for the referring physician to identify the causative thyroid disorder. This is optimally accomplished by a functional study, namely scintigraphy. Recognition of the scan findings of the various causes of subclinical hyperthyroidism enables the imaging specialist to help in diagnosing the underlying condition causing thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression thereby facilitating the workup and management of this thyroid disorder.

### Hyperthyroidism: diagnosis and treatment [^5ba3bf9a]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Hyperthyroidism is an excessive concentration of thyroid hormones in tissues caused by increased synthesis of thyroid hormones, excessive release of preformed thyroid hormones, or an endogenous or exogenous extrathyroidal source. The most common causes of an excessive production of thyroid hormones are Graves disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and toxic adenoma. The most common cause of an excessive passive release of thyroid hormones is painless (silent) thyroiditis, although its clinical presentation is the same as with other causes. Hyperthyroidism caused by overproduction of thyroid hormones can be treated with antithyroid medications (methimazole and propylthiouracil), radioactive iodine ablation of the thyroid gland, or surgical thyroidectomy. Radioactive iodine ablation is the most widely used treatment in the United States. The choice of treatment depends on the underlying diagnosis, the presence of contraindications to a particular treatment modality, the severity of hyperthyroidism, and the patient's preference.

Administration of radioactive iodine (RAI) in Graves' disease (GD) — Sufficient activity of RAI should be administered in a single application, typically a mean dose of 10–15 mCi (370–555 MBq), to render the patient with GD hypothyroid (Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). A pregnancy test should be obtained within 48 hours prior to treatment in any woman with childbearing potential who is to be treated with RAI, and the treating physician should verify a negative result prior to administering RAI (Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). The goal of RAI therapy in GD is to control hyperthyroidism by rendering the patient hypothyroid, and this outcome can be accomplished equally well by either administering a fixed activity or by calculating the activity based on the size of the thyroid and its ability to trap RAI.

### Current concepts in Graves' disease [^e274fd53]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Graves' disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the developed world. It is caused by an immune defect in genetically susceptible individuals in whom the production of unique antibodies results in thyroid hormone excess and glandular hyperplasia. When unrecognized, Graves' disease impacts negatively on quality of life and poses serious risks of psychosis, tachyarrhythmia and cardiac failure. Beyond the thyroid, Graves' disease has diverse soft-tissue effects that reflect its systemic autoimmune nature. Thyroid eye disease is the most common of these manifestations and is important to recognise given its risk to vision and potential to deteriorate in response to radioactive iodine ablation. In this review we discuss the investigation and management of Graves' disease, the recent controversy regarding the hepatotoxicity of propylthiouracil and the emergence of novel small-molecule thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor ligands as potential targets in the treatment of Graves' disease.
