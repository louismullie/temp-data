## Question

How should a compliant patient with hypothyroidism on levothyroxine 200mcg daily and a TSH of 6.344 be managed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage a "compliant" patient taking levothyroxine 200 mcg daily who has an elevated TSH of 6.344 mIU/L. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about analytic validity of the TSH result and pre-analytical confounders. Then, I should verify true adherence and administration technique, including timing and drug–food interactions. Next, I will check whether transient interferences explain the abnormality before changing the dose. After that, I need to consider malabsorption and formulation issues, then decide whether to switch formulation or up-titrate dose. I will also examine secondary causes and special situations if control remains suboptimal, and finally set a monitoring cadence and pragmatic targets aligned with guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the laboratory picture and its reliability; a TSH of 6.344 mIU/L is indeed above most reference intervals, but wait, I should verify which assay was used and maintain the same platform for trending because Roche immunoassays can read approximately 30% higher than Abbott, potentially shifting clinical interpretation if platforms change between draws, so I need to ensure assay consistency and consider method-dependent reference limits when comparing prior values [^1127zjRW] [^112G78x2].

> I should also screen for biotin interference; hold on, I need to ask explicitly about high-dose biotin or "hair/nail" supplements because the FDA label warns biotin can distort thyroid immunoassays, and I should stop biotin for at least 2 days before rechecking TSH and free T4 to avoid analytic artifact that could falsely suggest undertreatment [^117QfEeg].

> Next, I will review adherence and administration technique despite the note that the patient is "compliant"; wait, let me verify exact timing relative to meals and beverages, because guidelines advise taking levothyroxine consistently either 60 minutes before breakfast or at bedtime at least 3 hours after the last meal, with a minimum 30-minute separation from food or drink, and I need to ensure separation from interfering agents such as calcium, iron, bile acid sequestrants, PPIs, soy, and high-fiber foods by at least 4 hours, since these factors commonly elevate TSH despite apparent adherence [^112VueCg] [^113LxrHd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions by increasing the dose immediately; I should confirm whether this mild TSH rise could reflect transient interference or inconsistent ingestion, and ETA guidance advises retesting thyroid function in non-pregnant patients before increasing levothyroxine, so my action is to repeat TSH and free T4 under optimal conditions, after pausing biotin and standardizing timing, ideally using the same assay, with enough time to reflect steady-state physiology, typically 4–6 weeks, to avoid adjusting to noise [^113AV4mB] [^117QfEeg] [^1127zjRW].

> If TSH remains elevated after technique optimization, I need to check for malabsorption and formulation issues; at a daily dose of 200 mcg, which is relatively high, persistent elevation makes me consider celiac disease, H. pylori gastritis, atrophic gastritis, lactose intolerance, bariatric surgery, or nephrotic syndrome, and let me think about switching the formulation because liquid or softgel levothyroxine at the same dose can overcome tablet-excipient and gastric pH–related absorption problems in these settings, often normalizing TSH without increasing dose [^112GMb8Q] [^115V2h1X] [^116NSG5q].

> Wait, I should set expectations on timing; after switching formulation (or after any substantive change), I will recheck TSH and free T4 in about 6–8 weeks, since the peak therapeutic effect of a given levothyroxine dose is typically reached within 4–6 weeks, and another couple of weeks provides a pragmatic buffer to account for day-to-day variability and ensure stabilization before re-testing [^117QfEeg].

> If no malabsorption is identified and technique is impeccable, I can consider a modest dose increase, but let me reconsider the threshold; AACE/ATA gives stronger impetus to treat when TSH exceeds 10 mIU/L, and in a patient at 6.3 mIU/L on 200 mcg, I should weigh symptoms, cardiovascular risk, and antibodies, recognizing that fine-tuning within the reference range has not shown clear quality-of-life benefits, so any up-titration would be in small steps of about 12.5–25 mcg with caution to avoid overtreatment and without chasing "low-normal" targets for QoL alone [^111CspHm] [^115a5BfG] [^111cpkBq].

> I should double-check for secondary or special causes if TSH remains high despite optimized administration and a formulation switch; let me review interacting drugs such as PPIs, calcium, iron, sucralfate, cholestyramine, and confirm there is no pregnancy or nephrotic syndrome altering thyroid hormone kinetics, and I need to consider central hypothyroidism if the clinical picture is discordant, in which case TSH is unreliable and free T4 should guide dosing toward the mid–upper reference range rather than adjusting to TSH [^112GMb8Q] [^117KYzjT] [^113m2fbv].

> For monitoring, I need to ensure a disciplined cadence; I will recheck TSH 6–8 weeks after any dose or formulation change, maintain brand or preparation consistency whenever possible, and if a switch is necessary I should repeat labs about 6 weeks later, then, once stable within the lab's population reference interval, annual monitoring is generally sufficient, though patients on doses above 125 mcg/day have more frequent instability and may merit closer follow-up, and I should aim for a TSH within the reference interval rather than pushing to low-normal for non–evidence-based reasons [^117QfEeg] [^111wnznq] [^114VwJPF] [^111cpkBq] [^115a5BfG].

> Putting this together, my decision flow is as follows: let me first verify assay platform and pause biotin, then repeat TSH and free T4 in 4–6 weeks under optimal, consistent administration conditions using the same assay; if TSH remains elevated on 200 mcg, I will prioritize absorption issues by switching to a liquid or softgel formulation at the same dose and reassess in 6–8 weeks; if still elevated with no malabsorption or interactions, I will consider a cautious 12.5–25 mcg up-titration while acknowledging limited QoL gains from fine-tuning; if control remains suboptimal, I will evaluate for GI pathology, drug interactions, nephrotic syndrome or pregnancy, and exclude central hypothyroidism where free T4 guides therapy; throughout, I will keep the brand consistent and monitor with the appropriate intervals to achieve a TSH within the reference range without unnecessary complexity [^1127zjRW] [^117QfEeg] [^113AV4mB] [^115V2h1X] [^116NSG5q] [^112GMb8Q] [^111CspHm] [^115a5BfG] [^111wnznq].

For a patient with hypothyroidism, TSH 6.344 mIU/L, and confirmed compliance on 200 mcg/day levothyroxine, the most likely cause is **malabsorption or interference**. The recommended management is to **confirm TSH elevation** with repeat testing, review administration timing, and check for interfering medications or supplements [^112VueCg] [^113AV4mB]. If TSH remains elevated, **switch to a liquid or softgel levothyroxine** at the same dose, as these formulations improve absorption and often normalize TSH without dose increase [^115V2h1X] [^116NSG5q]. If TSH is still high after 6 weeks, evaluate for gastrointestinal disorders (celiac, H. pylori, IBD, bariatric surgery) and consider combination LT4/LT3 therapy only if malabsorption is excluded and symptoms persist [^112GMb8Q] [^115a2k8B]. Monitor TSH every 6–8 weeks until stable, then every 6–12 months [^111cpkBq].

---

## Confirm true TSH elevation and compliance

- **Repeat TSH testing**: Confirm the elevated TSH with a repeat test, ideally using the same assay, as transient fluctuations or assay variability can occur [^113AV4mB] [^1127zjRW].

- **Review levothyroxine administration**: Ensure the patient takes levothyroxine consistently, 30–60 minutes before breakfast or at bedtime ≥ 3 hours after the last meal, with water only [^112VueCg] [^113LxrHd].

- **Check for interfering medications and supplements**: Identify calcium, iron, proton pump inhibitors, bile acid sequestrants, sucralfate, antacids, or biotin, which can impair absorption or assay accuracy [^112VueCg] [^117QfEeg].

---

## Evaluate for malabsorption or interference

Persistent TSH elevation despite high-dose levothyroxine and confirmed compliance strongly suggests malabsorption or interference. Evaluate for **celiac disease, H. pylori infection, inflammatory bowel disease, lactose intolerance, or prior bariatric surgery**, as these can reduce levothyroxine absorption [^112GMb8Q]. Additionally, address dietary factors — such as excess fiber, soy, or coffee taken close to dosing — that impair absorption by ensuring consistent timing and separation from these foods [^112VueCg].

---

## Switch to alternative levothyroxine formulations

If malabsorption or interference is suspected, **switch to a liquid or softgel levothyroxine formulation at the same dose**, which has superior absorption and often normalizes TSH without a dose increase [^115V2h1X] [^116NSG5q]. Recheck TSH and free T4 6 weeks after the switch to assess response [^111wnznq].

---

## Consider combination therapy if malabsorption is excluded

If malabsorption is excluded and TSH remains elevated with persistent symptoms, consider **LT4/LT3 combination therapy**. A trial of LT4/LT3 (e.g. 10:1 to 20:1 ratio) may be used in selected patients with ongoing symptoms despite normalized TSH, with close monitoring for adverse effects [^115a2k8B].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitor **TSH every 6–8 weeks** after any dose or formulation change until stable, then every 6–12 months [^111cpkBq]. Also assess for symptoms of hypo- or hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular effects, and bone health, especially with high doses or combination therapy [^111cpkBq].

Persistent TSH elevation despite high-dose levothyroxine and confirmed compliance usually reflects **malabsorption or interference**. The recommended approach is to confirm the TSH, optimize administration, identify interfering factors, and switch to a liquid or softgel formulation; consider combination therapy only if malabsorption is excluded and symptoms persist, with regular monitoring to maintain euthyroidism.

Regarding medical management for hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to levothyroxine therapy (maintenance dosing), ETA 2025 guidelines recommend adjusting the dose of levothyroxine in patients with primary hypothyroidism to aim for a serum TSH level within the population reference interval. Once the target TSH is achieved, avoid complicated regimens and minute adjustments of levothyroxine dose for improving QoL or modulating body weight, as they are not useful.

### Levothyroxine: Conventional and novel drug delivery formulations [^112GMb8Q]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

The ideal normalization of thyroid hormone (TH) levels in these patients relies on the elimination of or an improvement in underlying diseases. In hypothyroid patients with parasitosis or H. pylori infection, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels usually return to the target range with a normal dose after antiparasitic or antibiotic therapy. A lactose-free formulation or gluten-free diet can alleviate impaired absorption in patients with lactose intolerance or celiac disease, respectively. Additionally, switching from levothyroxine (LT4) tablets to liquid preparations can restore thyroid function in patients with gastrointestinal dysfunction. Surprisingly, liquid solutions also alleviate malabsorption induced by some non-gastrointestinal disorders, such as nephrotic syndrome and pregnancy. Similarly, crushed tablet powder might resolve hypothyroidism due to bariatric surgery and lactose intolerance.

Unusual administration routes, including intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) injections, can also decrease unsuppressed TSH levels in patients with digestive tract disorders. Clinicians should be aware that severe refractory hypothyroidism is uncommon in patients with concomitant conditions. Many patients with malabsorption can achieve a serum TSH level in the target range with an increased dose of LT4.

Hypothyroidism requires life-long thyroid hormone replacement therapy in most patients. Oral levothyroxine (LT4) is an established safe and effective treatment for hypothyroidism, but some issues remain unsettled.

- **Methods**: The Italian Association of Clinical Endocrinologists appointed a panel of experts to provide an updated statement for appropriate use of thyroid hormone formulations for hypothyroidism replacement therapy. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists' protocol for standardized production of clinical practice guidelines was followed.

- **Results**: LT4 is the first choice in replacement therapy. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) should be maintained between 1.0 and 3.0 mIU/L in young subjects and at the upper normal limit in elderly or fragile patients. Achievement of biochemical targets, patient well-being, and adherence to treatment should be addressed. In patients with unstable serum TSH, a search for interfering factors and patient compliance is warranted. Liquid or gel formulations may be considered in subjects with hampered LT4 absorption or who do not allow sufficient time before or after meals and LT4 replacement. Replacement therapy with LT4 and L-triiodothyronine (LT3) combination is generally not recommended. A trial may be considered in patients with normal values of serum TSH who continue to complain of symptoms of hypothyroidism only after co-existent nonthyroid problems have been excluded or optimally managed. LT3 should be administered in small (LT4:LT3 ratio, 10:1 to 20:1) divided daily doses. Combined therapy should be avoided in general cases.

Regarding the medical management of hypothyroidism, specifically concerning levothyroxine therapy (indications, abnormal TSH), the AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of treatment based on individual factors. This is advised for patients with TSH levels between the upper limit of a given laboratory's reference range and 10 mIU/L, particularly if patients exhibit symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism, have positive anti-TPO antibodies, or show evidence of ASCVD, HF, or associated risk factors for these diseases.

Participants are blinded to treatment allocation by using matching tablets and packaging for levothyroxine and placebo. All study personnel remain blinded for the duration of the trial through remote analysis of laboratory results of TSH in the data centre, ensuring the trial stays double-blinded. General practitioners (GPs) will remain blinded to treatment allocation and TSH tests unless otherwise required in the event of an emergency medical situation. An Interactive Voice Response System at the data centre allows for individual emergency allocation information to be released to an unblinded study physician through 24-hour telephone access. All participants will learn the treatment allocation within 15 working days of receiving the final visit and completing all the data to aid in any further treatment decisions with their GP.

All laboratory tests for TSH and fT4 are performed at the local GP and clinical laboratories. The results in the treatment phase are uploaded to the independent data centre, which in turn advises the study site on dose titration through the dedicated trial web portal. The study team remains unaware of the results of the thyroid function testing. Additionally, all cooperating GPs were asked to refrain from additional thyroid function measurements to ensure adequate blinding.

### Levothyroxine replacement doses are affected by gender and weight, but not age [^116MHcEx]. Thyroid (2011). Low credibility.

Body weight (BW) and age have been shown to affect the dose of levothyroxine (LT(4)) that results in normalization of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in hypothyroid patients. Our objective was to determine whether gender, menstrual status, and ideal body weight (IBW) also affect the LT(4) dose required to achieve a serum TSH within the normal range.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients being treated for primary hypothyroidism who had TSH values within a normal range. We selected patients aged 18–85 years who were taking LT(4) without any confounding medications and who had no serious chronic conditions. Their LT(4) doses, referred to here as LT(4) dose requirements, based on both BW and IBW were documented. The relationship between gender, menstrual status, age, serum TSH concentrations, and the degree of overweight on LT(4) dose requirements were determined using multivariate analyses.

- **Results**: Women were significantly more overweight than men (ratio of BW/IBW was 1.35 for women vs. 1.17 for men, p < 0.0001). LT(4) requirements based on BW did not differ by gender when age was included in the model. However, when the degree of overweight was also included, men required lower LT(4) doses than both premenopausal women (1.34 μg/kg vs. 1.51 μg/kg, p = 0.038) and menopausal women (1.34 μg/kg vs. 1.49 μg/kg, p = 0.023). When examining IBW using a model incorporating age, men also required lower LT(4) doses than both premenopausal women (1.64 μg/kg vs. 1.92 μg/kg, p = 0.0033) and menopausal women (1.64 μg/kg vs. 1.90 μg/kg, p = 0.0024).

### Low-normal or high-normal thyrotropin target levels during treatment of hypothyroidism: A prospective, comparative study [^116qtkcg]. Thyroid (2011). Low credibility.

Recent literature advocates the decrease of the upper limit of the normal thyrotropin (TSH) reference range. The objective of this study was to determine whether treated hypothyroid patients maintained within a low-normal TSH range (0.4–2.0 mIU/L) have better clinical outcomes than those maintained within a high-normal TSH range (2.0–4.0 mIU/L).

- **Methods**: The study was performed in a thyroid outpatient clinic of a tertiary hospital. This was a prospective, interventional study. Forty-two participants with newly diagnosed overt primary hypothyroidism were paired in two groups: group 1 (n = 20), low-normal target TSH; group 2 (n = 22), high-normal target TSH. Levothyroxine was initiated, and the dose was adjusted to achieve and sustain the target TSH value during the study period. After the target TSH was reached, participants were evaluated every 3 months for thyroid function, serum lipid profile, resting energy expenditure (REE), body composition, and bone mineral density for 12 months.

- **Results**: Nineteen patients in group 1 and 16 in group 2 completed the study. In the whole-group analysis, total cholesterol (p = 0.01), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.004), and triglycerides (p < 0.001) decreased after treatment, whereas REE per kilogram of lean body mass (p = 0.001) and total fat body mass (p = 0.02) increased. Group 1 patients had a significantly higher relative increase in REE (+7.1% ± 11.3% vs. +3.6% ± 15.1%, p = 0.02). There was no difference between the groups in the other variables.

### The magnitude of increased levothyroxine requirements in hypothyroid pregnant women depends upon the etiology of the hypothyroidism [^116mfndN]. Thyroid (2009). Low credibility.

In the United States, many women with hypothyroidism are on thyroid hormone replacement during pregnancy. The optimal management strategy for thyroid hormone dosing in hypothyroid women during pregnancy is controversial. We hypothesized that dosage requirements during pregnancy might differ depending upon the nature of the underlying hypothyroidism.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective review of 45 pregnancies from 38 women whose hypothyroidism was managed during pregnancy. Thyroid function tests were obtained when pregnancy was confirmed, then every 4–8 weeks. The thyrotropin (TSH) goal was 0.4–4.1 microU/mL (SI unit conversion: multiply TSH by 1.0 for mIU/L).

- **Results**: On average, the entire group required a cumulative increase from baseline in levothyroxine (LT(4)) dosage of 13% in the first trimester, 26% in the second trimester, and 26% in the third trimester (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively). Average baseline LT(4) dose for patients with primary hypothyroidism was 92.5 ± 32.0 microg daily. These patients required small cumulative dose increases of 11%, 16%, and 16% from baseline in each trimester, respectively (p values = 0.125, 0.016, 0.016). Average baseline LT(4) dose for patients with hypothyroidism resulting from treated Graves' disease or goiter was 140.4 ± 62.4 microg daily. These patients required the largest cumulative increases in LT(4) dosage (first trimester, 27%; second trimester, 51%; third trimester, 45%; p = 0.063, 0.063, 0.063, respectively). Average baseline LT(4) dose for patients with thyroid cancer was 153.2 ± 30.

### Levothyroxine treatment for congenital hypothyroidism based on thyroid function: A 10-year clinical retrospective study [^113dyyPY]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to explore the appropriate dosage of levothyroxine treatment for patients with congenital hypothyroidism presenting with different thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels.

- **Methods**: A total of 116 patients, who were regularly followed up in our endocrine clinic from January 2010 to December 2020, were divided into four groups based on their thyroid function: Group A (TSH ≥ 100 mIU/L), Group B (TSH ≥ 20 and < 100 mIU/L), Group C (TSH ≥ 6.6 and < 20 mIU/L), and Group D (TSH < 6.6 mIU/L). The initial dosage of levothyroxine was individualized for each patient based on their TSH level and then adjusted according to their thyroid function at every follow-up. The levothyroxine dosage at each time point was compared between groups, as were thyroid function and physical and neurological development post-treatment.

- **Results**: After individualized dosage adjustment, all patients achieved normal thyroid function. Although there were statistical differences in neurological development between the four groups (p < 0.05), development was within the normal range for all groups.

- **Conclusion**: An individualized levothyroxine dosage can provide the same therapeutic effect as the recommended dosage. This strategy may also reduce the risk of drug overdose.

### Synthroid [^117QfEeg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Important considerations for dosing**: The dosage of Synthroid for hypothyroidism or pituitary TSH suppression depends on a variety of factors, including the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant medications, co-administered food, and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5), and Drug Interactions (7)]. Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors, with dosage adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

For adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, titrate until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

For secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism, serum TSH is not a reliable measure of Synthroid dosage adequacy and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum free-T4 level to titrate Synthroid dosing until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4 level is restored to the upper half of the normal range [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Inquire whether patients are taking biotin or biotin-containing supplements. If so, advise them to stop biotin supplementation at least 2 days before assessing TSH and/or T4 levels [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.10)].

The peak therapeutic effect of a given dose of Synthroid may not be attained for 4 to 6 weeks.

### Targeted levothyroxine therapy for treatment of congenital hypothyroidism [^111oA3ZZ]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine if infants with congenital hypothyroidism (CH), whose initial dose of levothyroxine (LT4) is based on thyroid gland anatomy, require fewer dose adjustments in the first six months of life than those who were started empirically on LT4.

- **Methods**: Newborns with CH who had a thyroid ultrasound performed at diagnosis were eligible for this prospective, historical case-controlled study. The daily LT4 dose prescribed was based on thyroid ultrasound results as follows: 15 mcg/kg for athyreosis, 12 mcg/kg for a dysgenetic thyroid, and 10 mcg/kg for an anatomically normal gland. Routine labs were obtained according to standard guidelines, and the number of dose adjustments over the first six months of therapy was recorded. Each study participant was matched with two historical controls with CH based on sex and thyroid anatomy.

- **Results**: Twenty-two subjects (10 with athyreosis, 4 with dysgenetic glands, and 8 with anatomically normal glands) were matched to 44 controls. There was no significant difference in the overall number of adjustments in the study group compared to controls (P = 0.74). However, there were significantly fewer adjustments made for undertreatment (P = 0.03) and significantly more adjustments made for overtreatment (P = 0.006) in subjects with athyreosis compared to controls.

- **Conclusion**: Targeted LT4 therapy does not appear to decrease the overall frequency of dose adjustments for infants with CH. However, 15 mcg/kg/day appears to exceed thyroid hormone requirements in infants with CH due to athyreosis.

### How should we treat patients with low serum thyrotropin concentrations [^116SUZCg]. Clinical endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined by a low serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration in the presence of normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3). It is helpful to distinguish between those with a detectable but low TSH value (in the 0.1–0.4 mU/l range) and those with a fully suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/l). We suggest the designation of grade I and grade II SH, respectively. These patterns of thyroid function tests are found in 1–3% of the elderly population and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in longitudinal epidemiological surveys.

There are a number of causes for this picture, which include endogenous thyroid disease, drug effects, and concomitant nonthyroidal illness. Treatments commonly employed in the management of thyrotoxicosis are effective at correcting the biochemical abnormalities of SH but have not been shown to improve clinical outcomes or symptoms. There is little good quality evidence available to guide the assessment or management of these patients. This review summarizes the clinical significance of SH and aims to provide guidance about whether we should treat patients with low serum TSH concentrations.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: Cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^112Cg569]. Endocrine Practice (2012). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypothyroidism, specifically with respect to levothyroxine therapy (indications, normal TSH), the AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of L-thyroxine in female patients of childbearing age who are planning a pregnancy in the immediate future, including assisted reproduction. This recommendation also applies to pregnant patients with normal serum TSH levels in the presence of or past positive levels of serum anti-TPO antibodies, particularly if there is a history of miscarriage or past history of hypothyroidism.

### Thyroid antibodies and levothyroxine effects in subclinical hypothyroidism: A pooled analysis of two randomized controlled trials [^113WyXiu]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SHypo), defined as an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level with free thyroxine (fT4) in the reference range, affects up to 6%–18% of older adults. Although clinical guidelines differ on which patients should be treated, SHypo is frequently treated with levothyroxine (LT4). This contributes to levothyroxine being one of the most prescribed medications in the United States and Europe.

In older adults, two recent international, double-blind, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) — The Thyroid Hormone Replacement for Untreated Older Adults with Subclinical Hypothyroidism (TRUST) and the IEMO80+ Thyroid Trial — and a meta-analysis found no benefit of levothyroxine on hypothyroid symptoms, tiredness, or quality of life, even among those with high symptom burden. However, specific subgroups might still benefit, such as patients with autoimmune thyroid disease.

### Postintervention serum TSH levels may be useful to differentiate patients who should undergo levothyroxine suppressive therapy after thyroid surgery for multinodular goiter in a region with moderate iodine deficiency [^1152ezBu]. Thyroid (2000). Low credibility.

Recent studies have raised doubts about the efficacy of the postoperative use of levothyroxine (LT4) suppressive doses in patients who underwent thyroid surgery for multinodular goiter. The purpose of this retrospective study was to examine the efficacy of different doses of LT4 in preventing postsurgical recurrences of simple multinodular goiter and to identify a marker that could be useful in discriminating patients with a higher risk of developing recurrence.

Two hundred thirty-two patients (57 male, 175 female) operated for nontoxic multinodular goiter were divided into two groups: (I) patients with normal postsurgery thyrotropin (TSH) levels (0.25 to 4.5 mU/L) and (II) patients with elevated postsurgery TSH levels (> 4.5 mU/L). All patients were subjected to replacement (1.3 microg LT4/kg/day) or suppressive (1.7 microg LT4/kg/day) doses of LT4, and they were followed for a median period of 6 years (range 2 to 12).

No statistical difference was found for sex, age, and postsurgery serum TSH between patients submitted to suppressive and replacement therapy. The ultrasound (US) detection of new postsurgery nodules of at least 0.5 cm maximum diameter was considered a recurrence of disease and was found in 10% of the cases studied. Patients with normal postsurgery serum TSH showed a high recurrence rate (30.4%) when submitted to lower daily doses of LT4. In patients with elevated postsurgery serum TSH, the rate of nodular goiter recurrence did not vary with different types of LT4 therapy.

In conclusion, our results suggest that the postsurgical serum TSH is useful for predicting potential recurrence risk in patients undergoing thyroid surgery for multinodular goiter in a region with moderate iodine deficiency.

### Patient-tailored levothyroxine dosage with pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling: A novel approach after total thyroidectomy [^112CHNmK]. Thyroid (2021). High credibility.

The number of patients (above bars) who achieved their TSH goals eight weeks after thyroidectomy and the initiation of LT4 replacement therapy is presented as follows:

- **Data application results**: When the DAT was applied, more patients reached their narrow TSH goal after 8 weeks in patients treated for goiter (p = 0.005) and cancer (p = 0.003). For goiter patients, the light color illustrates the proportion of patients with TSH within the normal reference range as compared with the narrower TSH target in the study (0.5–2.0 mIU/L, dark colors).

- **LT4 dosage adjustments**: This section describes the dynamics of LT4 dosage adjustments and total distance to reach TSH goals. The distance to the final LT4 dosage during the first 20 weeks of follow-up for patients with goiter and cancer is shown. Light colors indicate CIs. The distance to the final dosage dropped significantly after 2 weeks in DAT groups [goiter t = 3.16, p = 0.003, cancer t = 3.52, p = 0.001], but not in controls (n.s.).

- **Time to TSH target achievement**: Violin plots show the time to achieve TSH targets (black dots for individual patients), with the median indicated by white lines and quartiles by black dotted lines. The TSH targets were reached earlier in the goiter (p = 0.016) and cancer (p = 0.017) groups that used the DAT. CI, confidence interval.

### Patient-tailored levothyroxine dosage with pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling: A novel approach after total thyroidectomy [^117MxN5T]. Thyroid (2021). Low credibility.

The consequences of efficient dosage adjustments after thyroidectomy in terms of work capacity, sick leave, quality of life, or other patient-reported outcomes must be determined before establishing whether a minimum of five postoperative blood draws is acceptable. This number is comparable to routine follow-up in the first author's clinic before the development of the DAT (supplemental data). However, there is large variation in the reported number of necessary dosage adjustments after thyroidectomy, likely reflecting that optimal care is yet to be established. We believe that the advantages of the DAT outweigh the extra cost of early blood samples by reducing the number of follow-up visits and shortening the dosage adjustment period. Furthermore, further refinement of our model could lower the number of needed samples.

The failure of the simplified DAT to improve dosage for thyrotoxic patients suggests that individual fT4-TSH estimations are necessary to achieve successful dosage with our model. The majority of the patients in the thyrotoxicosis group had a totally suppressed TSH before surgery and were still on anti-thyroid hormone drugs. Slow recovery of normal TSH dynamics after prolonged suppression made our model vulnerable to mistakes, as it relied heavily on initial blood samples. Additionally, our assumption that a log-linear relationship exists between TSH and fT4 may not be valid for this group. The overall altered metabolism in patients with Graves' disease could also change during the course of follow-up, making initial estimations invalid later.

### Thyroid antibodies and levothyroxine effects in subclinical hypothyroidism: A pooled analysis of two randomized controlled trials [^116ss6pH]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Baseline data are expressed as the number of participants (percentage) for categorical characteristics or as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median (interquartile range [IQR]) for continuous characteristics. In line with the protocol and first reports, the primary analysis considered all participants in the intention-to-treat population who had the 1-year follow-up visit within the protocol-specified window. In this study, only participants with an anti-TPO status at baseline were included.

- **Statistical methods**: Between-group comparisons on the difference between 1-year follow-up and baseline values were performed using linear mixed-effects regression models. This included an interaction term between the treatment group and baseline anti-TPO status, with adjustments for stratification variables (sex, country, and randomization dose) and the respective baseline values. This adjustment was necessary given that randomization was not stratified by baseline antibody status as measured after the trial end, and study was considered as a random effect.

The effect size for the interaction (i.e. the difference between the differences between the treatment groups) was based on the SD of the difference between the treatment groups in both anti-TPO groups. By averaging the patient numbers within both groups, a difference in the difference of 6.9 points on the scale could be detected significantly with 80% power at a two-sided alpha of 0.05. The analysis was repeated for the per-protocol population, including all participants who pursued the trial regimen, i.e. on treatment at the time of the analysis being conducted and who had their 12-month follow-up assessment.

### The ages and TSH values of patients being prescribed levothyroxine [^115ykRjT]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism affects approximately 5% of the United States population, and synthetic thyroxine in the form of levothyroxine (LT4) is the most prescribed therapy for this common condition. Autoimmune hypothyroidism is generally progressive, with a decrement in endogenous thyroid function occurring over time, such that overt hypothyroidism would occur if the thyroid hormone deficiency is untreated. However, hypothyroidism may initially be diagnosed when it is mild or subclinical, at a time when the serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is minimally elevated below 10 mIU/L and the serum thyroid hormone levels are normal. Symptoms of hypothyroidism are not always specific for this condition, and each of the symptoms generally associated with hypothyroidism may also have non-thyroid causes. As attribution of the cause of symptoms is not a simple matter, many physicians may err on the side of treating mild TSH elevations with the expectation that symptoms may improve. Thus, treatment with LT4 may be initiated for borderline TSH elevations. The authors also hypothesize that LT4 may even be prescribed for unconfirmed serum TSH elevations, or even without TSH elevation, based only on the symptoms that the patient is experiencing.

LT4 is being prescribed with increasing frequency, both in the United States and in other countries. Several studies have shown that the TSH threshold at which LT4 therapy is initiated has fallen over time, such that an increasing number of cases of subclinical hypothyroidism are being treated and the mean or median TSH values have…

### Patient-tailored levothyroxine dosage with pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling: A novel approach after total thyroidectomy [^113mrykC]. Thyroid (2021). Low credibility.

In the thyrotoxicosis group, we could not reliably estimate individual fT4 targets due to frequent TSH suppression. Instead, we applied a simplified DAT version with a population-based fT4 target. The number of patients who reached their TSH target after eight weeks was not different between the DAT and control groups.

- **Number of patients achieving TSH goals**: Figure 5 illustrates the number of thyrotoxic patients who achieved their TSH goals eight weeks after thyroidectomy and initiation of LT4 replacement therapy.
	- (A) Application of a simplified DAT, which only used population-based fT4 targets, had no effect on the number of patients who reached their TSH target after eight weeks [Chi-square 1.63, p = 0.20].
	- (B) The distance to the final LT4 dosage during the first 20 weeks of follow-up for patients with thyrotoxicosis is shown, with light colors indicating confidence interval (CI). The distance to final dosage was not significantly reduced in the DAT group after two weeks [t = 0.99, p = 0.34].
	- (C) Violin plots display the time to achieve TSH targets, with black dots representing individual patients. The median is indicated by white lines, and quartiles by black dotted lines. It took longer to reach the TSH targets when the simplified DAT was used, as compared with controls [t (42) = -2.96, p = 0.005].

### Thyroid laboratory testing and management in women on thyroid replacement before pregnancy and associated pregnancy outcomes [^113hVAa9]. Thyroid (2021). Low credibility.

The study's findings suggest that greater attention to clinical factors associated with TSH suppression may be required when adjusting levothyroxine dosage during pregnancy. Yassa et al. identified three factors that should potentially trigger a more conservative approach in the initial levothyroxine increase to prevent overtreatment. They found that athyreotic patients, females with a preconception TSH below 1.50 mIU/L, and those treated with a levothyroxine dose of at least 100 mcg/day before conception were at greater risk of TSH suppression less than 0.50 mIU/L during pregnancy following an initial levothyroxine dose increase.

We conducted a post hoc analysis to further explore factors associated with TSH suppression less than 0.10 mIU/L during pregnancy in our population, and this showed similar results. Our findings reinforced those of Yassa et al. and underscore the need for clinical judgment to guide the ATA's strong recommendation to increase levothyroxine dosage by 25–30% in all pregnant women. Indeed, a subgroup of pregnant women with preconception TSH less than 1.50 mIU/L or levothyroxine dose greater than 100 mcg/day may benefit from a more conservative approach to levothyroxine increments during pregnancy.

Monitoring of dose and follow-up

Serum or plasma FT4 (or TT4) and TSH concentrations should be determined at least 4 hours after the last L-T 4 administration. TSH concentration should be maintained in the age-specific reference range; TT4 or FT4 concentration should be maintained in the upper half of the age-specific reference range. Any reduction of L-T 4 dose should not be based on a single increase in FT4 concentration during treatment.

The first follow-up examination should take place 1–2 weeks after the start of L-T 4 treatment. Subsequent evaluation should take place every 2 weeks until complete normalization of TSH concentration is reached, then every 1 to 3 months thereafter until the age of 12 months. Between the ages of one and three years, children should undergo frequent clinical and laboratory evaluations every 2 to 4 months. Thereafter, evaluations should be carried out every 3 to 12 months until growth is completed. More frequent evaluations should be carried out if compliance is questioned or abnormal values are obtained. Additional evaluations should be carried out 4–6 weeks after any change in L-T 4 dose or formulation.

Adequate treatment throughout childhood is essential, and overtreatment should be avoided.

### Optimal thyroid hormone replacement [^115a2k8B]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common endocrinopathy, and levothyroxine is frequently prescribed. Despite agreement on the basic tenets of initiating and adjusting levothyroxine, there are many nuances and complexities to consistently maintaining euthyroidism. Understanding the impact of patient weight and residual thyroid function on the initial levothyroxine dosage, as well as considering age, comorbidities, thyrotropin goal, life stage, and quality of life when adjusting levothyroxine, can be challenging and continually evolving. Because levothyroxine is a lifelong medication, it is important to avoid risks from periods of overtreatment or undertreatment.

For the subset of patients not restored to baseline health with levothyroxine, causes arising from all aspects of the patient's life (coexistent medical conditions, stressors, lifestyle, psychosocial factors) should be broadly considered. If such factors do not appear to be contributing, and biochemical euthyroidism has been successfully maintained, there may be benefit to a trial of combination therapy with levothyroxine and liothyronine. This is not supported by the majority of randomized clinical trials but may be supported by other studies providing lower-quality evidence and by animal studies. Given this discrepancy, it is important that any trial of combination therapy be continued only as long as a patient benefit is being enjoyed. Monitoring for adverse effects, particularly in older or frail individuals, is necessary, and combination therapy should not be used during pregnancy. A sustained-release liothyronine preparation has…

### Adequate levothyroxine doses for the treatment of hypothyroidism newly discovered during pregnancy [^117MPwAW]. Thyroid (2013). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines recommend thyrotropin (TSH) target levels of ≤ 2.5 mIU/L for the first trimester and ≤ 3 mIU/L for the subsequent trimesters. Euthyroidism should be attained as soon as possible, but there are no precise indications about the initial levothyroxine (LT4) dose. The aim of our study was to determine the appropriate LT4 doses to normalize TSH levels in patients with newly discovered subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) during pregnancy and to correlate them with basal TSH levels. The adequate LT4 doses for women with SCH were also compared to those required in pregnant women with overt hypothyroidism (OH).

- **Methods**: Seventy-seven patients with newly diagnosed hypothyroidism during pregnancy were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were assigned to group 1 (n = 64) with SCH or group 2 (n = 13) with OH. SCH patients were subdivided into two groups: group 1a with serum TSH > 2.5 (1st trimester) or > 3 (2nd or 3rd trimester) to 4.2 mIU/L; and group 1b with TSH levels > 4.21–10 mIU/L. All patients were treated with LT4 as soon as hypothyroidism was diagnosed. The dose that allowed a TSH of ≤ 2.5 mIU/L to be reached in the first trimester or one that allowed a TSH of ≤ 3 mIU/L to be reached during the second and third trimesters was considered the appropriate one.

- **Results**: A significant difference (p < 0.0001) in the appropriate LT4 dose (mean ± SD, μg/kg/day) was observed between group 1 and group 2: 1.31 ± 0.36 versus 2.33 ± 0.59. Patients in group 1a required a significantly lower LT4 dose (p < 0.014) than group 1b: 1.20 ± 0.39 versus 1.42 ± 0.31 μg/kg/day. In 57 of the 77 patients, the appropriate LT4 dose was successfully determined.

Persistent elevation of TSH levels in patients undergoing treatment for hypothyroidism is a common clinical issue in endocrinology practice. The primary cause of this phenomenon is often poor patient compliance with their thyroid hormone medication. However, in patients who are compliant, multiple etiologies can be considered. A methodological and stepwise approach to addressing the patient's issue is crucial for identifying the cause or finding a potential resolution.

### Study protocol: a randomised controlled trial on the clinical effects of levothyroxine treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism in people aged 80 years and over [^115MxVGg]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). High credibility.

A maximum of two levothyroxine up-titrations at the start of the trial and one up-titration at 12 and 24 month (± 1 month) intervals with repeated TSH measurements after 6–8 weeks ensure adequate levothyroxine treatment while avoiding potential over-replacement. The maximum possible dose of levothyroxine is 150 micrograms.

A mock titration adopting an adaptive schedule is performed in the placebo group by the data centre. A similar proportion of placebo patients will have up and down titrations of study medication as the intervention group to ensure the number of tablets and assessments is similar in both groups. Because all thyroid function measurements are available only to the data centre, the clinical investigators remain fully blinded to the treatment allocation process during the trial.

Accountability logs recording the quantities of study medication dispensed to and returned from study participants, batch numbers, and expiry dates are available for all study drug movements.

- **Criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated study medication**: If overt biochemical hypothyroidism is identified (TSH > 20 mU/L and/or fT4 below the reference range), a second TSH with fT4 within 2 weeks is requested. Upon confirmation of biochemical hypothyroidism, the participant will be withdrawn from the study treatment and referred to the General Practitioner (GP) for usual care. If overt biochemical hyperthyroidism is identified (TSH < 0.4 mU/L) in the placebo group, or consecutively in the treatment group despite downtitrations, the participant will be withdrawn from the study treatment.

### Patient-tailored levothyroxine dosage with pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling: A novel approach after total thyroidectomy [^112Hggkk]. Thyroid (2021). Low credibility.

The DAT development and validation study design involved creating a model based on pilot data, as detailed in the Supplemental Data. Briefly, the model parameters were derived from four blood draws analyzed for TSH and fT4 obtained during the first two weeks of LT4 therapy. A log-linear relationship between TSH and fT4 was assumed, allowing for modeling of individual TSH-fT4 response and fT4 pharmacokinetics using population data. Individual TSH-fT4 responses are illustrated in Figure 1.

The DAT was tested in a prospective multicenter trial in which participants were randomized to the application of the DAT or to a control group. An automated stratified randomization based on diagnosis and participating hospital was utilized. Following surgery and prior to randomization, all participants received an LT4 starting dosage, typically ranging from 100 to 150 μg/day, determined by diagnosis, body weight, age, and comorbidity. Participants were instructed to provide pre-LT4 ingestion blood samples twice per week for two weeks postoperatively (Fig. 2). To minimize variability in measurements, patients were advised to take the medication and provide all blood samples in the morning. On sampling days, patients delayed LT4 intake until after blood collection.

Two to three weeks post-surgery, participants received a follow-up call advising them either to continue with the current dosage or to adjust it. In the DAT group, the responsible surgeon received assistance from the DAT, which provided a graphical plot of the predicted fT4 and TSH for a suggested dosage change (Fig. 3). The DAT was disabled in the control group.

### Normal limits for serum thyrotropin vary greatly depending on method [^112G78x2]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels within populations do not follow a Gaussian distribution, and normal limits are derived after mathematical normalization. The clinical relevance of these limits is unknown. The objective of this study was to compare upper and lower TSH limits by four data normalization methods with non-normalized data and assess their clinical relevance.

- **Design, patients, and measurements**: Results of blood samples taken by community physicians and stored in a computerized database were analyzed after removing samples from patients with evidence of thyroid illness. TSH values were normalized by the Hoffmann and Tukey methods, each method with natural log transformation. Non-normalized data for TSH in the uppermost and lowermost percentile were also calculated. Clinical relevance was determined by alterations in thyroid hormone levels at, below, and above the limits for each method.

- **Results**: The maximal reduction from non-normalized data for the upper normal limit (UNL) was by the Hoffmann method (43% = 3.1 mIU/l). The maximal increase for the lower normal limit (LNL) was also by the Hoffmann method (708% = 0.81 mIU/l). There was very limited difference in average FT3 and FT4 between patients with TSH within, below, or above the normal range for all methods.

- **Conclusions**: Different normalization methods alter the normal limits greatly. However, in individuals without thyroid illness, thyroid hormone values are stable over a wide range of TSH levels, including beyond the UNL for all methods. Indeed, there may be no true universal upper TSH cut-off.

### Levothyroxine treatment for congenital hypothyroidism based on thyroid function: a 10-year clinical retrospective study [^115Wxkf1]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

To explore the appropriate dosage of levothyroxine treatment for congenital hypothyroidism patients with different thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, a total of 116 patients, who were regularly followed up in our endocrine clinic from January 2010 to December 2020, were divided into four groups based on their thyroid function: group A (TSH ≥ 100 mIU/L), group B (TSH ≥ 20 mIU/L and < 100 mIU/L), group C (TSH ≥ 4.6 mIU/L and < 20 mIU/L), and group D (TSH < 4.6 mIU/L).

- **Methods**: The initial dosage of levothyroxine was individualized for each patient based on their TSH level and then adjusted according to their thyroid function at every follow-up time point. The levothyroxine dosage at each time point was compared between the groups, and both thyroid function and physical and neurological development after treatment were also compared.

- **Results**: After individualized dosage adjustment, all patients achieved normal thyroid function. Although there were statistical differences in neurological development between the four groups (p < 0.05), development was within the normal range for all groups.

- **Conclusion**: An individualized levothyroxine dosage can provide the same therapeutic effect compared to the recommended dosage. This strategy may also reduce the risk of a drug overdose.

### Patient-tailored levothyroxine dosage with pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling: A novel approach after total thyroidectomy [^112Z55Kn]. Thyroid (2021). High credibility.

- **Results**: The DAT was tested in a validation RCT on patients diagnosed with goiter and differentiated thyroid cancer, while the simplified DAT was tested on patients with thyrotoxicosis. There was no statistical difference between the DAT and control groups in the basic characteristics, nor in the initial and final dosages of LT4. Most patients with cancer received TSH suppression, while all patients with goiter and most patients with thyrotoxicosis received replacement therapy. There was no difference in clinically decided TSH targets between DAT and controls (all patients with goiter had the same TSH target, Pearson Chi-square p = 0.58 for cancer and p = 0.61 for thyrotoxicosis).

- **Faster dosage adjustment with DAT in patients with goiter and cancer**: For all RCT groups, 24 of 68 patients (35%) reached their narrow TSH targets eight weeks after surgery with DAT assistance, compared to 10 of 67 patients (15%) in the control group (Chi-square = 7.43, p = 0.006). As the DAT for thyrotoxic patients utilized a simplified population-based fT4 target, unlike the individually estimated fT4 targets for patients with goiter and cancer, further analysis was conducted on subgroups. Forty percent of patients with goiter and 59% of patients with cancer in DAT groups were within the TSH target after 8 weeks, compared with 0% and 19% in control groups, respectively (Fig. 4A, Chi-squares 7.94, p = 0.005 and 8.87, p = 0.003).

### Assessment of attainment of recommended TSH levels and levothyroxine compliance in differentiated thyroid cancer patients [^114PvbP7]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression treatment can induce signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism due to inappropriate treatment strategies or poor compliance with treatment protocols. This study aimed to investigate TSH levels, the frequency of achieving target TSH levels, and adherence to levothyroxine (LT4) suppression treatment in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) patients after surgery in a multicentric setting.

This multicentric cross-sectional study was conducted at 21 medical centers across 12 cities in Turkey. DTC patients included in the study had been followed for at least one year at the same center. Clinical data, including serum TSH, free thyroxine (FT4), thyroglobulin (Tg), and anti-Tg levels, were recorded during the most recent visit. Additional measurements such as body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and pulse rate were also assessed. LT4 doses were recorded, and doses per kilogram of body weight were calculated. Pill ingestion habits were documented, and adherence to therapy was evaluated using the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale. Patients were categorized as having good, moderate, or poor compliance based on their scores.

Risk stratification for predicting disease persistence and/or recurrence was assessed using the American Joint Committee on Cancer-7th edition thyroid cancer staging calculator. TSH serum concentrations were classified into categories: severe suppression (TSH < 0.01mU/L), moderate suppression (TSH: 0.01–0.1mU/L), mild suppression (TSH: 0.1–0.5mU/L), euthyroid (TSH: 0.5–4mU/L), and hypothyroid (TSH > 4mU/L). TSH levels were also classified as being on target or under the target.

### Optimal levothyroxine dosing strategy for immune checkpoint inhibitor-related hypothyroidism: A retrospective study [^1163XWD9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-related hypothyroidism is mostly irreversible, and prompt thyroid hormone replacement therapy is crucial, especially for patients undergoing neoadjuvant immunotherapy. This study aimed to propose a novel titration strategy for ICI-related hypothyroidism, evaluate levothyroxine (LT4) dose differences between hypothyroidism patterns, and develop a predictive equation for the optimal LT4 dose. It was conducted as a retrospective study in a tertiary academic hospital and included 109 patients with ICI-related hypothyroidism.

- **Interventions**: Rapid versus conventional titration strategy.
- **Main outcome measures**: The time to achieve normal free thyroxine (FT4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels.

Results indicated that patients with transient thyrotoxicosis followed by overt hypothyroidism (Toxic-OHypo) required higher LT4 doses to achieve a euthyroid state compared to isolated overt hypothyroidism, with a mean difference of 0.23 μg/kg/day (95% confidence interval, 0.08–0.38). In patients with ICI-related overt hypothyroidism and no cardiac disease, who had elevated TSH levels within 4 weeks of the last documented low or normal TSH, a rapid titration strategy was implemented. This strategy significantly improved the cumulative incidence of achieving normal FT4 and TSH levels compared to conventional titration strategy (hazard ratio [HR], 4.44; 95% CI, 2.24–8.82; HR, 4.11; 95% CI, 2.18–7.73, respectively), with a comparable safety profile.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^113m2fbv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for central hypothyroidism, specifically with respect to thyroid replacement therapy, ES 2016 guidelines recommend adjusting levothyroxine doses to maintain appropriate free T4 levels and avoid low or elevated levels. This helps mitigate the possible long-term cardiovascular risks associated with insufficient or excessive thyroid hormone treatment. It is advised not to use serum TSH levels to adjust thyroid replacement dosing in patients with central hypothyroidism (CeH).

### Diagnosis and treatment of hypothyroidism in TSH deficiency compared to primary thyroid disease: Pituitary patients are at risk of under-replacement with levothyroxine [^113k1s5S]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011).

Achieving optimal thyroid hormone replacement is more difficult in TSH deficiency compared to primary hypothyroidism because of the inability to be guided by serum TSH levels. A combination of clinical symptoms and free thyroxine levels (fT4) are typically used to make a diagnosis and monitor replacement. We investigated the diagnosis of TSH deficiency in patients with pituitary disease and the adequacy of levothyroxine replacement compared with primary thyroid disease.

- **Design**: Using our department's clinical information system, we identified all patients with a diagnosis of any type of pituitary tumour who had been seen in clinic over a 2-year period. We divided the patients into those at high risk and low risk of TSH deficiency based on the presence of macroadenoma and/or intervention by surgery or radiotherapy. We compared fT4 values in these patients with values in patients with primary thyroid disease in our thyrotoxicosis shared-care scheme (TSC) and hypothyroid register within the same timescale, assessing only those samples considered euthyroid in which TSH was in the normal range.

- **Results**: A database query identified 525 patients with a pituitary tumour, of whom 344 were considered at high risk of TSH deficiency. A free T4 (fT4) value was found for 514 patients (97.9%). TSC and thyroid register databases revealed fT4 values for comparison with simultaneous normal TSH in patients on no treatment (n = 3,777 samples) or on levothyroxine alone (n = 11,805). fT4 levels overall were lower in pituitary patients than in equivalent controls. Of the high-risk group…

### Postpartum levothyroxine adjustment and its impact factors in women with hypothyroidism in pregnancy [^112HdG4P]. Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

Women with hypothyroidism need to increase exogenous thyroid hormone levels during pregnancy to reduce adverse outcomes. Few studies have reported the effect of gestational levothyroxine (LT4) variations on postpartum LT4 treatment.

- **Methods**: Women were classified as having subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) (n = 101), overt hypothyroidism (OH) caused by autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT-OH), OH following thyroidectomy for benign thyroid disease (BA-OH) (n = 66), and OH after surgery for papillary thyroid cancer (PTC-OH) (n = 46). Thyroid function was monitored, and LT4 therapy was adjusted accordingly.

- **Results**: After delivery, all women with SCH stopped LT4 treatment, and 57.4% of them restarted LT4 treatment in the following 1 year, independently of the gestational LT4 variations. Among patients with OH, after adjustment by gestational body weight, 49.1% had LT4 doses less than the prepregnancy dose (baseline) in late pregnancy, leading to LT4 reduction in postpartum. The LT4 dose was reduced to approximately 50% of the baseline for women with AIT-OH and BA-OH and reduced by 27% for women with PTC-OH. The reduction reasons for AIT-OH and BA-OH were thyroid-stimulating hormone levels of < 2.5 mU/L during pregnancy and postpartum thyrotoxicosis occurrence (39.4%), and for PTC-OH, the reason was thyroid-stimulating hormone overinhibition (< 1.0 mU/L) before delivery.

- **Conclusion**: For patients with SCH, postpartum LT4 treatment could initially be suspended. For women with OH, if the LT4 dose in late pregnancy was less than baseline, a prepregnancy dose reduced by 50%, 50% a.

### Levothyroxine dosage is associated with stability of thyroid-stimulating hormone values [^114VwJPF]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

In patients treated for hypothyroidism, the usual practice is to monitor thyroid-stimulating hormone values yearly once a therapeutic dosage of levothyroxine is determined. This study investigates whether there are any clinical predictors that could identify a subset of patients who might be monitored safely on a less frequent basis.

- **Methods**: With the use of a retrospective study design, 715 patients treated for hypothyroidism who had a normal (i.e. therapeutic) thyroid-stimulating hormone value in 2006 while taking levothyroxine were identified. All thyroid-stimulating hormone values were then obtained through December 31, 2012. By using a Cox proportional hazard model, gender, age, body mass index, history of chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, initial thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and levothyroxine dose were analyzed for time to first abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone value.

- **Results**: Age, gender, history of chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, and body mass index at the time of initial normal thyroid-stimulating hormone were not significantly associated with time to abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone value. Levothyroxine dose > 125 μg/day had an increased hazard ratio of 2.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.7–3.4; P < 0.05) when compared to those with a lower dosage.

Regarding medical management for congenital hypothyroidism, specifically in relation to levothyroxine dosing and administration, the ETA 2018 guidelines recommend initiating levothyroxine therapy in patients with congenital central hypothyroidism (such as TSHβ mutations) as soon as possible. Optimally, this should occur within 2 weeks after birth, at doses used for primary CH, to rapidly restore serum fT4 levels to normal range and ensure optimal treatment as quickly as possible.

### Patient-tailored levothyroxine dosage with pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling: A novel approach after total thyroidectomy [^113NVeoS]. Thyroid (2021). Low credibility.

This is the first study to suggest LT4 dosage adjustment based on repeated fT4 and TSH measurements during the first two weeks after thyroidectomy. Application of the DAT enabled the clinician to make appropriate dosage adjustments after only two weeks. It is hard to compare the performance of our model directly against other published dosage schemes because they all use the entire TSH reference range as goal achievement, while we used a narrower TSH target also for replacement therapy.

The reason we did not include TSH range > 2.0 mIU/L in our targets was that high normal TSH values are associated with comorbidity, and to make our TSH targets more applicable to all diagnoses in the study, including cancer. The study was thus not designed to evaluate our model against other published dosage schemes, but to evaluate whether computerized modeling would allow meaningful early LT4 dose adjustments before a steady state is reached.

When recalculating our eight-week data for patients with goiter using the entire TSH reference range as goal achievement, we found, however, that our model outperforms other published dosage schemes. Care must be taken when interpreting these data, as the number of patients is low both in our study groups and in comparable studies.

### Empathy: A new tool for identifying the most suitable thyroxine formulation in hypothyroid patients [^111rcYXk]. Thyroid (2019). Low credibility.

Therapy of hypothyroidism is based on the administration of appropriate doses of levothyroxine (LT4). Failure to achieve the thyrotropin (TSH) target may be due to poor compliance with the LT4 therapy in about 60% of cases or to malabsorption in about 40% of cases. No tools are available for detecting malabsorption disorders before choosing the most appropriate therapy. The aim of this study was to validate the Evaluation of Malabsorption in Patients with Hypothyroidism (EMPATHY) questionnaire and to demonstrate its usefulness in indicating the most appropriate therapy.

- **Methods**: EMPATHY consists of seven questions that allow the evaluation of several intolerances and allergies. Three hundred (100 males) newly diagnosed hypothyroid patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to complete an EMPATHY questionnaire (150 patients; group 1) or to a control group (150 patients; group 2). The choice of thyroxine formulation and dose for each group was made on the basis of the questionnaire answers or based on the history. Thyroid hormones and TSH were evaluated at enrollment and then every two months for six months; the number of dose adjustments in the six months for each patient was recorded.

- **Results**: Of the 150 patients in each group, 21 (14%) in group 1 and 42 (28%) in group 2 (p = 0.005) needed more than two dose adjustments within six months. After six months of replacement therapy, six (4%) patients in group 1 and 17 (11%) in group 2 (p = 0.03) did not have appropriately controlled hypothyroidism (TSH ≥ 2.5 mIU/L). A significantly higher LT4 final dose…

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^113yC48n]. Thyroid (2014). High credibility.

A number of recent advances in our understanding of thyroid physiology may shed light on why some patients feel unwell while taking levothyroxine monotherapy. The purpose of this task force was to review the goals of levothyroxine therapy, the optimal prescription of conventional levothyroxine therapy, the sources of dissatisfaction with levothyroxine therapy, the evidence on treatment alternatives, and the relevant knowledge gaps. We wished to determine whether there are sufficient new data generated by well-designed studies to provide a reason to pursue such therapies and change the standard of care. This document is intended to inform clinical decision-making on thyroid hormone replacement therapy; it is not a replacement for individualized clinical judgment.

- **Methods**: Task force members identified 24 questions relevant to the treatment of hypothyroidism. The clinical literature relating to each question was then reviewed. Clinical reviews were supplemented, when relevant, with related mechanistic and bench research literature reviews, performed by our team of translational scientists. Ethics reviews were provided, when relevant, by a bioethicist. The responses to questions were formatted, when possible, in the form of a formal clinical recommendation statement. When responses were not suitable for a formal clinical recommendation, a summary response statement without a formal clinical recommendation was developed. For clinical recommendations, the supporting evidence was appraised, and the strength of each clinical recommendation was assessed.

### The ages and TSH values of patients being prescribed levothyroxine [^113YxiQr]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Levothyroxine is a commonly prescribed medication. Some data suggest that levothyroxine may be initiated for mild degrees of hypothyroidism and used without considering age-specific reference ranges or individual patient factors when prescribing.

- **Methods**: The electronic medical record of a healthcare system operating in the Washington, DC, and Maryland area was interrogated to determine the number of patients who were being prescribed levothyroxine during the period 2008–2016, the number of prescriptions supplied to these individuals, an associated diagnosis of hypothyroidism, and whether the prescriptions were new or existing. Information was also extracted about the age of patients receiving prescriptions and the thyroid-stimulating hormone level documented prior to levothyroxine initiation.

- **Results**: Although the number of levothyroxine prescriptions provided annually increased over this period, when corrected for the number of patients in the database, the percentage of patients receiving levothyroxine prescriptions showed a slight downward trend. Levothyroxine was both most frequently prescribed and frequently initiated in those aged 50–59 years and 60–69 years. The doses of levothyroxine most commonly prescribed were 50 µg and 100 µg, and the pattern of levothyroxine doses being used was unaffected by whether a diagnosis of hypothyroidism was documented or not. Levothyroxine prescription initiation was associated with mean thyroid-stimulating hormone values that were modestly elevated and in the range of 7.5–13.8 mIU/L.

### Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of the combined preparation of levothyroxine plus sustained-release liothyronine; a randomized controlled clinical trial [^112NLywK]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). High credibility.

- **Discussion**: Decreased serum T4 concentrations and increased serum T3 concentration in treatment with 12 µg SR-T3 plus 60 µg LT4 led to a significant increase in serum T3/T4 ratio after intervention; however, the serum T3/T4 ratio was lower than the normal serum T3/T4 ratio in euthyroid subjects (~1:14–15) and no difference was observed in serum T3, T4, and T3/T4 ratio after intervention between CBT (combination therapy) and LT4 monotherapy groups. Single-dose administration of LT4 + SR-T3 was associated with more improved T3-derived Tmax (~4–5 h) and Cmax (~105 ng/dl) while serum T3 concentration remained within normal ranges with no fluctuation for 24 h after achieving the maximum level.

	- The only study by Hennemann et al. with a randomized crossover design on fifteen patients (mean age of 50 y.) with primary hypothyroidism showed that T4 plus sustained-release T3 (1:20 ratio) improved serum TSH, T4, and T3 concentrations and the T4/T3 ratio compared to treatment with LT4 alone, while non-physiologic T3 peaks were avoided. In the survey, despite a significant increase in serum T3/T4 ratio in intervention groups, no difference was observed in serum thyroid hormone profile and T3/T4 ratio between CBT and LT4 monotherapy groups at follow-up. However, similar to the Hennemann study, sustained-release T3 did not indicate serum T3 peaks during 24 h. Our study had the preference of using a more appropriate SR-T3 dosage and included only patients in whom the thyroid gland was ablated by radioactive iodine; whereas, in the study by Hennemann, hypothyroid patients with heterogeneous etiology were included.

### Management of primary hypothyroidism: Statement by the British Thyroid Association Executive Committee [^111sUrae]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

The management of primary hypothyroidism with levothyroxine (L-T4) is simple, effective, and safe, with most patients reporting improved well-being upon initiation of treatment. However, a proportion of individuals continue to suffer from symptoms despite achieving adequate biochemical correction. The management of such individuals has been the subject of controversy and considerable public interest.

The American Thyroid Association (ATA) and the European Thyroid Association (ETA) have recently published guidelines on the diagnosis and management of hypothyroidism. These guidelines are based on extensive reviews of the medical literature and include sections on the role of combination therapy with L-T4 and liothyronine (L-T3) for individuals who remain dissatisfied with L-T4 therapy.

This position statement by the British Thyroid Association (BTA) summarizes the key points from these guidelines and makes recommendations on the management of primary hypothyroidism. These recommendations are based on literature reviews of the published positions of the ETA and ATA, aligning with the best practices of good medical practice. The statement is endorsed by the Association of Clinical Biochemistry (ACB), British Thyroid Foundation (BTF), Royal College of Physicians (RCP), and Society for Endocrinology (SFE).

- **Serum TSH > 2.5 mIU/L**: In patients planning a pregnancy in the immediate future, including assisted reproduction.

- **Serum TSH > 2.5 mIU/L**: During the first trimester of pregnancy.

- **Serum TSH > 3.0 mIU/L**: During the second trimester of pregnancy.

### Randomized trial comparing two algorithms for levothyroxine dose adjustment in pregnant women with primary hypothyroidism [^1172Xfai]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

The regulation of maternal thyroid hormones during pregnancy is crucial for optimal maternal and fetal outcomes. Currently, there are no specific guidelines addressing maternal levothyroxine (LT4) dose adjustments throughout pregnancy.

- **Objective**: To compare two LT4 dose-adjustment algorithms in hypothyroid pregnant women.

- **Design**: Thirty-three women on stable LT4 doses were recruited at less than 10 weeks of gestation during 38 pregnancies and randomized into one of two dose-adjustment groups. Group 1 (G1) employed an empiric two-pill-per-week dose increase followed by subsequent pill-per-week dose adjustments. In Group 2 (G2), LT4 dose was adjusted continuously in micrograms per day based on thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level and LT4 dose. TSH levels were monitored every 2 weeks during the first and second trimesters and every 4 weeks in the third trimester.

- **Setting**: Academic endocrinology clinics in Washington, DC.

- **Main outcome measure**: The proportion of TSH values within trimester-specific goal ranges.

- **Results**: The mean gestational age at study entry was 6.4 ± 2.1 weeks. Seventy-five percent of TSH values were within trimester-specific goal ranges in G1, compared with 81% in G2 (P = 0.09). Similar numbers of LT4 dose adjustments per pregnancy were required in both groups (G1, 3.1 ± 2.0 vs. G2, 4.1 ± 3.2; P = 0.27). Women in G1 were more likely to have suppressed TSH levels < 0.1 mIU/L in the first trimester (P = 0.01). The etiology of hypothyroidism, but not thyroid antibody status, was associated with the proportion of goal TSH values.

- **Conclusions**: We compared two options for LT4 dose adjustment and demonstrated that an ongoing adjustment approach resulted in a higher proportion of TSH values within the goal range.

### Small changes in thyroxine dosage do not produce measurable changes in hypothyroid symptoms, well-being, or quality of life: results of a double-blind, randomized clinical trial [^115a5BfG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

In patients with primary hypothyroidism, anecdotal evidence suggests that well-being is optimized by fine adjustment of T(4) dosage, aiming for a serum TSH concentration in the lower reference range. This hypothesis had not been tested in a clinical trial prior to this study.

- **Objective**: Our objective was to test whether adjustment of T(4) dosage, aiming for a serum TSH concentration less than 2 mU/liter, improves well-being compared with maintaining a serum TSH concentration in the upper reference range.

- **Design**: We conducted a double-blind, randomized clinical trial with a crossover design.

- **Participants**: Fifty-six subjects (52 females) with primary hypothyroidism taking T(4) (≥ 100 μg/d) with baseline serum TSH ranging from 0.1 to 4.8 mU/liter participated.

- **Interventions**: Each subject received three T(4) doses (low, middle, and high in 25-μg increments) in random order.

- **Outcome measures**: Outcome measures included visual analog scales assessing well-being as the primary endpoint, hypothyroid symptoms, quality of life instruments (General Health Questionnaire 28, Short Form 36, and Thyroid Symptom Questionnaire), cognitive function tests, and treatment preference.

- **Results**: Mean (± SEM) serum TSH concentrations were 2.8 ± 0.4, 1.0 ± 0.2, and 0.3 ± 0.1 mU/liter for the three treatments. There were no significant treatment effects on any instruments assessing well-being, symptoms, quality of life, or cognitive function, and no significant treatment preference.

- **Conclusions**: Small changes in T(4) dosage do not produce measurable changes in hypothyroid symptoms, well-being, or quality of life.

### Biochemical assessment of adequate levothyroxine replacement in primary hypothyroidism differs with different TSH assays: potential clinical implications [^1127zjRW]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to assess the potential impact of Abbott and Roche TSH assay differences on the biochemical assessment of levothyroxine replacement in primary hypothyroidism. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) assays provided by Abbott Laboratories and Roche Diagnostics are used by approximately 75% of laboratories in the UK.

- **Method**: Samples from 100 consecutive primary care patients (83 women, median age 64 years; IQR 51–73 years) with primary hypothyroidism on adequate levothyroxine, based on an Abbott Architect TSH in the reference range, were analyzed for TSH on Roche cobas within 24 hours. The Abbott and Roche TSH results were compared. Over one year, TSH results from patients in primary care from laboratories using Abbott and Roche methods were also compared.

- **Results**: The median (IQR) Roche TSH (2.5 (1.3–3.6) mIU/L) was 30% ± 10% higher (p < 0.001) than Abbott TSH (1.9 (1.1–2.6) mIU/L). Although all Abbott TSH results were within the Abbott-specific reference range, 14 patients (14%) had Roche TSH results above the Roche-specific reference range. In the one-year study, Roche TSH (1.9 (1.3–2.9) mIU/L, n = 103,932) results were higher (p < 0.001) than Abbott TSH (1.5 (1.0–2.2) mIU/L, n = 110,544) results. TSH results were above their assay-specific upper reference limit in 10.7% of Roche results and 4.2% of Abbott results.

- **Conclusion**: Biochemical assessment of levothyroxine replacement may be dependent on the type of TSH assay. It is important for laboratorians and clinicians to be aware that the lack of harmonization between TSH methods and their assay-specific reference ranges may potentially lead to different clinical implications.
