## Question

Patient with a hemoglobin of 10 and dizziness post op

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and manage a postoperative patient with hemoglobin 10 g/dL and dizziness. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the dizziness is likely related to anemia or to other perioperative causes like orthostatic hypotension, medications, or vasovagal phenomena. Then, I should verify the appropriate transfusion threshold for this specific context and whether 10 g/dL warrants transfusion. Next, I will examine alternative explanations for dizziness and outline a focused diagnostic workup. Finally, I will synthesize a management plan that balances anemia management, fall prevention, and safe mobilization, and I will double-check any conflicting guideline nuances before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the significance of a hemoglobin of 10 g/dL in the postoperative period. A hemoglobin of 10 g/dL represents moderate anemia and is below the normal adult range, but it sits above the restrictive transfusion thresholds used in most stable, non-cardiac postoperative patients, so I should not jump to transfusion without symptoms or compelling risk factors [^113nUZwa] [^112KZsz6]. I need to ensure I am not overlooking ongoing bleeding, volume status derangements, or medication effects that could explain dizziness independent of anemia per se [^113Sfg5h].

> Wait, let me verify the dizziness–anemia relationship. Dizziness is a recognized symptom of anemia and can reflect reduced oxygen delivery, but it is also a cardinal symptom of orthostatic hypotension, which is common after anesthesia and surgery and independently predicts falls and delayed recovery in older adults, so I should not assume anemia is the sole driver here [^112KZyD4] [^115SxfoB]. I should also consider vasovagal or Bezold–Jarisch–type responses in the setting of pain, opioid use, or reduced venous return, and I must remember that symptoms alone do not reliably identify orthostatic hypotension, necessitating objective blood pressure measurements [^115L2m8h] [^113X16Sj].

> Next, I should review transfusion thresholds. For most stable, asymptomatic postoperative adults, a restrictive threshold of 7–8 g/dL is supported by high-quality evidence and specialty guidelines, and the landmark FOCUS trial in hip fracture patients showed no benefit of a liberal 10 g/dL strategy versus a restrictive 8 g/dL or symptomatic strategy, so hemoglobin 10 g/dL alone should not trigger transfusion in the absence of symptoms or high-risk comorbidity [^113nUZwa] [^1129zSzG]. Hold on, I should verify exceptions: patients with active coronary ischemia or severe cardiopulmonary disease may benefit from a more liberal approach, and some institutional protocols use 10 g/dL as a trigger in patients with cardiovascular insufficiency, but that is not the default for a stable, otherwise low-risk postoperative patient with isolated dizziness [^117LzcGt] [^115FHEBi].

> I will now examine alternative causes of dizziness that must be ruled in or out before attributing symptoms to anemia. I need to check for orthostatic hypotension with supine and standing blood pressures at 1 and 3 minutes, review medications with hypotensive or sedative effects, assess volume status and recent fluid shifts, and screen for pain, anxiety, sleep deprivation, and early postoperative complications such as bleeding or infection that could contribute to lightheadedness or near-syncope [^115SxfoB] [^112KZyD4] [^1146kEcz]. But wait, what if the patient is on beta-blockers or other agents that blunt heart rate responses? That could mask tachycardia and make orthostatic intolerance more likely even with modest hemoglobin reductions, so I should double-check the medication list and consider dose adjustments if hypotension is present [^115L2m8h].

> Let me consider the differential for postoperative dizziness beyond anemia and orthostatic hypotension. Vasovagal syncope can occur with pain, anxiety, or venous pooling and may present with dizziness or even bradyasystolic events in susceptible patients, particularly when coupled with relative hypovolemia or anemia, so I should assess for precipitating factors and autonomic vulnerability [^115L2m8h]. I should also keep in mind medication-related contributors such as sedatives, opioids, antihypertensives, and local anesthetic systemic toxicity if regional techniques were used, and I need to ensure we are not missing early infection, hypoglycemia, or electrolyte disturbances that can mimic or exacerbate dizziness [^1126hgGH] [^1146kEcz].

> Next, I should review a focused diagnostic workup. I will obtain orthostatic vital signs, a basic metabolic panel, glucose, and a repeat hemoglobin/hematocrit to confirm stability and exclude hemodilution or ongoing blood loss, and I will review the chart for estimated blood loss, drain output, and urine output to assess volume status and occult bleeding risk [^113Sfg5h]. If dizziness persists without a clear cause, I should consider an ECG to evaluate rhythm or ischemia, and if there is concern for autonomic dysfunction or medication effects, I will reassess the drug regimen and consider temporary modifications under the treating teams [^1146kEcz].

> Now, I need to synthesize the management plan. Initially, I thought transfusion might be reasonable at 10 g/dL because of dizziness, but wait, I should verify the threshold again; with only dizziness and no ischemic symptoms, ongoing bleeding, or high-risk cardiac disease, transfusion is not indicated, so I should prioritize non-transfusion strategies first and reassess if symptoms progress or hemoglobin falls toward 8 g/dL or if high-risk features emerge [^113nUZwa] [^1129zSzG]. I should optimize intravascular volume with judicious crystalloids, implement fall-prevention measures, and only consider transfusion if symptoms persist after addressing orthostatic and volume issues or if hemoglobin declines with evidence of ongoing blood loss or organ ischemia [^112KZsz6].

> For anemia management without transfusion, I should confirm iron status and, if iron deficiency is present, prefer intravenous iron over oral iron in the early postoperative period due to poor absorption and tolerability, using weight-based dosing and considering single high-dose infusions when available, while monitoring for modest infection risk and ensuring close follow-up of hemoglobin trajectory [^116KV1rN] [^111SRbBB]. Let me reconsider timing: starting IV iron during hospitalization or shortly after discharge can accelerate hemoglobin recovery and reduce transfusion exposure, though clinical outcome benefits vary across settings, so I should align this with patient-specific goals and logistics [^116KV1rN] [^112kSygn].

> For orthostatic hypotension and dizziness, I should implement non-pharmacologic measures first: slow positional changes, adequate hydration, compression stockings or an abdominal binder, and physical counter-maneuvers, and I should time antihypertensives to avoid early-morning hypotension while ensuring blood pressure is sufficient to support mobilization and perfusion [^113uen51] [^1146kEcz]. If symptoms persist and blood pressure drops exceed 20 mmHg systolic or 10 mmHg diastolic on standing, I should consider pharmacologic therapy such as midodrine or fludrocortisone after addressing reversible contributors, and I should coordinate with the surgical and anesthesia teams to adjust sedatives or opioids that may worsen orthostasis [^113uen51].

> Regarding mobilization, I need to ensure a safe plan: supervised, gradual ambulation with assistive devices, pre-mobilization vitals, and fall precautions, because orthostatic symptoms and fear of falling are common barriers to early mobilization after joint arthroplasty and hip fracture care, and addressing blood pressure lability can improve participation and potentially shorten length of stay without increasing fall risk [^1148GjHf] [^112XpfDu]. Hold on, I should verify that the physical therapy team is aware of the orthostatic findings and medication timing so they can tailor the mobilization schedule accordingly [^1146kEcz].

> I should double-check monitoring and reassessment. Hemoglobin should be rechecked within 24–48 hours to exclude a downward trend, and if the patient remains symptomatic, I should repeat orthostatic vitals after interventions and escalate evaluation for occult bleeding or alternative diagnoses if dizziness persists despite correction of volume, anemia, and orthostatic factors [^113Sfg5h]. If at any point ischemic symptoms, ongoing bleeding, or hemodynamic instability emerge, I should lower my transfusion threshold and transfuse one unit at a time with reassessment, consistent with restrictive, symptom-guided strategies [^113nUZwa] [^112KZsz6].

> In summary, hemoglobin 10 g/dL with isolated dizziness in a stable postoperative patient does not meet transfusion thresholds; I should prioritize identifying and treating orthostatic hypotension, optimizing volume status, and correcting iron deficiency with IV iron when indicated, while monitoring closely for bleeding, symptom progression, or the emergence of cardiac ischemia that would justify a more liberal transfusion approach [^113nUZwa] [^1129zSzG] [^116KV1rN]. I need to ensure a coordinated plan across teams for fall prevention and safe mobilization, and I will reassess transfusion need if hemoglobin approaches 8 g/dL or if high-risk cardiovascular features or active ischemia develop [^111e8Xjj] [^112KZsz6].

A postoperative hemoglobin of 10 g/dL with dizziness warrants a **focused evaluation** for ongoing bleeding, orthostatic hypotension, and medication effects. Transfusion is **not indicated** unless there is active bleeding, hemodynamic instability, or severe symptoms; instead, manage conservatively with fluids, iron therapy, and close monitoring. If dizziness persists or worsens, reassess for occult bleeding, cardiac ischemia, or neurologic causes and escalate care as needed [^113nUZwa] [^111SRbBB] [^1146kEcz].

---

## Clinical significance of hemoglobin 10 g/dL postoperatively

A hemoglobin of 10 g/dL represents **moderate anemia** and is common after surgery due to blood loss, hemodilution, or inflammation-driven iron sequestration. It can cause dizziness, fatigue, and reduced exercise tolerance, especially in older adults or those with comorbidities [^116KV1rN] [^1136Uu1L].

---

## Differential diagnosis of dizziness in postoperative patients with hemoglobin 10 g/dL

Dizziness in this setting is **multifactorial**; consider:

- **Anemia-related dizziness**: Reduced oxygen delivery causing cerebral hypoperfusion [^115FHEBi].
- **Orthostatic hypotension**: Common postoperatively due to volume shifts, autonomic dysfunction, or medications [^112KZyD4] [^115SxfoB].
- **Medication-induced dizziness**: Sedatives, opioids, antihypertensives, or antiemetics [^notfound].
- **Hypovolemia**: Ongoing bleeding or inadequate fluid resuscitation [^1148GjHf].
- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hypokalemia, hyponatremia, or metabolic derangements [^notfound].
- **Cardiac arrhythmias or ischemia**: Especially in patients with cardiovascular disease [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evaluation and diagnostic approach

A **structured evaluation** should include:

| **Step** | **Evaluation** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Vital signs (BP, HR, orthostatics) | Identify hypotension, tachycardia, or orthostatic intolerance [^112KZyD4] [^115SxfoB] |
| 2 | Medication review | Identify drugs causing hypotension or sedation [^1146kEcz] |
| 3 | Laboratory tests | - CBC <br/> - Electrolytes <br/> - Renal function <br/> - Glucose <br/> - Coagulation profile [^113Sfg5h] |
| 4 | Clinical examination | Assess for ongoing bleeding, dehydration, or neurologic deficits [^113Sfg5h] |
| 5 | Additional tests if indicated | - ECG <br/> - Echocardiography <br/> - Imaging (CT/MRI) for occult bleeding or neurologic causes [^113Sfg5h] [^114KAsL3] |

## Management strategies

### Conservative management

- **Fluid resuscitation**: Crystalloids for hypovolemia; avoid over-resuscitation [^114tsQq4].
- **Iron supplementation**: IV iron preferred postoperatively due to better absorption and tolerability [^116KV1rN] [^111SRbBB].
- **Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents**: Consider in severe anemia or transfusion refusal [^112mxa3u].
- **Fall precautions**: Bed rest, assisted ambulation, and patient education [^1146kEcz].

---

### Indications for blood transfusion

Transfusion is **generally not indicated** at 10 g/dL unless:

- **Active bleeding**: Ongoing blood loss with hemodynamic instability [^112KZsz6] [^115o2hfK].
- **Severe symptoms**: Dizziness with syncope, chest pain, or ischemia [^111tfNQS] [^115FHEBi].
- **High-risk patients**: Severe cardiovascular disease or ongoing ischemia [^113nUZwa].

Restrictive thresholds (**7–8 g/dL**) are supported by guidelines for stable patients without severe symptoms [^113nUZwa] [^111e8Xjj].

---

## Potential complications of untreated anemia and dizziness

Untreated anemia and dizziness can lead to:

- **Increased fall risk**: Fractures, head injuries, and prolonged recovery [^113X16Sj].
- **Delayed wound healing**: Impaired tissue oxygenation [^notfound].
- **Cardiac complications**: Arrhythmias, ischemia, or heart failure exacerbation [^117LboG9].
- **Prolonged hospital stay**: Increased healthcare costs and resource utilization [^115CqYGV].

---

## Prognosis and recovery timeline

With appropriate management, most patients recover within **1–2 weeks**; hemoglobin typically rises 1–2 g/dL weekly with iron therapy. Persistent symptoms beyond this warrant re-evaluation for ongoing bleeding, malabsorption, or alternative diagnoses [^115tZ7BY] [^1171wSFX].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring plan

- **Daily hemoglobin checks**: Until stable, then every 2–3 days [^notfound].
- **Regular clinical assessment**: Track dizziness, orthostatic symptoms, and functional status [^1146kEcz].
- **Iron therapy monitoring**: Ferritin, transferrin saturation, and reticulocyte count [^114Jezfm].
- **Patient education**: Teach symptom recognition and when to seek care [^notfound].

---

A postoperative hemoglobin of 10 g/dL with dizziness should be managed conservatively unless there is active bleeding or severe symptoms. Focus on **identifying and treating reversible causes**, using iron therapy, and monitoring closely; reserve transfusion for select cases.

### Does fracture type or surgical technique influence mortality in elderly hip fracture patients? [^115FHEBi]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Surgical Techniques and Perioperative Management

All surgical procedures were performed by the same experienced surgical team to ensure consistency. For patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty, cementless arthroplasty with a bipolar head was utilized. For those treated with proximal femoral nailing (PFN), the Intertan PFN design was used in all cases. Postoperatively, all patients were mobilized with full weight-bearing as tolerated, starting within 48 h after surgery under the supervision of healthcare personnel. In our institution, short-term Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission (typically < 24 h) is a common precautionary practice for elderly patients, based on preoperative assessment by anesthesiologists. Many patients are monitored in a first-level ICU unit located within the operating complex and are transferred to the ward as soon as clinically stable. As institutional protocol, early mobilization is attempted even in ICU-monitored patients, provided their condition permits.

All patients received low molecular weight heparin for thromboprophylaxis for four weeks following surgery. Preoperatively, all included patients were ambulatory without assistive devices and able to perform their daily activities independently, aligning with the inclusion criterion of pre-fracture physical activity independence.

In this study, postoperative blood transfusions were administered according to standardized clinical guidelines specifically tailored for elderly patients with hip fractures.

The primary triggers for transfusion, both before and after surgery, included hemoglobin levels falling below 8 g/dL, symptomatic anemia (eg, shortness of breath, dizziness, tachycardia, or chest pain), significant blood loss exceeding 500 mL, or the need for hemodynamic stabilization. Additionally, patients with cardiovascular or pulmonary insufficiency were also considered for transfusion under these criteria.

For those with a history of cardiovascular disease, a more conservative approach was taken, with transfusions initiated when hemoglobin levels dropped below 10 g/dL. This protocol was designed to optimize oxygen delivery and reduce potential complications, prioritizing safety and positive outcomes for this high-risk elderly population.

### Multiple asystole events in a patient undergoing total knee arthroplasty-a case report [^115L2m8h]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

In addition to the pre-existing conditions of the patient, another cause for the asystole events could be a relative imbalance between the para- and sympathetic nervous systems, resulting in a decreased HR, venous pooling and loss of vascular tone, which would be consistent with the findings of our cardiologists. This proposed pathway agrees with the pathophysiology of the Bezold-Jarisch reflex. A vasovagal syncope as a cause for an asystole is also conceivable. Pain stimuli and decreased venous return, transmitted by the glossopharyngeal and vagal nerves, perhaps led to activation of the medullary vasomotor centre. Increased vagal activity stimulates the parasympathetic system accompanied by depression of sympathetic activity, followed by bradycardia, vasodilation and decreased release of catecholamines. In addition, the surgical positioning (supine position and intermittently lifting of the right leg) and procedure, accompanied by the patient's pre-existing state of severe obesity, leads to an increased intrabdominal pressure in the patient, resulting in compression of the inferior vena cava with reduced venous return and lower right arterial pressure. The patient also did not wear compression stocking on the left non-operated leg, which may have aggravated venous pooling. Regarding reduced venous return and possible higher risk for vasovagal reactions, haemoglobin levels should also be considered. The patient had a haemoglobin level of 7 mmol/l at the beginning of surgery. The haemoglobin level fell to 5.9 mmol/l during surgery. Under catecholamine therapy, the mean arterial pressure of the patient was more than 60 mmHg with normal HR, even if the systolic BP of the patient was lower than that during her everyday life. According to the criteria of patient blood management (PBM), there was no indication for a blood transfusion. The patient received 2 l of balanced electrolyte solution as volume replacement. Blood loss (approximately 800 ml) could cause lower venous return, resulting in an enhanced vasovagal reaction. Irrespective of the recommendations of the PBM criteria, it is conceivable that the patient would have needed higher blood levels of haemoglobin, which was not noticeable because of the effects of the usual medication (e.g. no tachycardia due to beta blocker therapy, no changes in BP after stabilisation with catecholamine treatment). Regarding the infection of the prothesis and the re-operation, a higher volume of blood loss should be considered, and in preparation for surgery, anaemia should have been treated in this case. There are current guidelines for PBM, especially for patients undergoing knee and hip arthroplasty. In our patient, the ferritin level should have been determined, and if necessary, iron and/or erythropoietin could have been replaced. Spahn (2010) described significantly increased mortality in patients with pre- and postoperative anaemia undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty. It is possible that this patient group needs a blood transfusion earlier to improve postoperative outcomes.

### Efficacy of alternate mucosa-submucosa clip closure in preventing postoperative adverse events for patients with gastric mucosal lesions after endoscopic submucosal dissection: a multicenter retrospective study [^114uKNZj]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Definitions of terms

In this study, delayed hemorrhage refers to bleeding that occurs within 24 h to 30 days after ESD and meets at least two of the following indicators: (a) Vomiting blood, black stools, dizziness, and other uncomfortable symptoms; (b) drop in hemoglobin > 20 g/L; (c) drop in blood pressure > 20 mmHg or increase in heart rate > 20 beats/min; and (d) gastroscopy suggesting bleeding. Delayed perforation was defined as sudden postoperative symptoms of peritoneal irritation, postoperative abdominal plain films, or computed tomography (CT) suggesting the presence of free gas. Postoperative stenosis refers to a postoperative scar after ESD resulting in the narrowing of the digestive tract lumen. Postoperative abdominal pain was scored using a numeric rating scale ranging from 0 to 10 to indicate the degree of pain, with 0, 1–2, 3–5, and ⩾6 indicating no, mild, moderate, and severe pain, respectively. Patients selected a number from 0 to 10 to indicate their pain level according to their most genuine pain feelings, which were recorded by the nurse on the postoperative day. For patients with multiple pain scores, the highest score was selected. Wound healing rate was calculated by the percentage of ulcers that reached the healing stage endoscopically out of the total number of people that underwent gastroscopic follow-up.

Methodology

Data collection

Data related to lesion and endoscopic characteristics were collected, including endoscopic lesion characteristics, postoperative pathologic characteristics, and intraoperative indicators. According to the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association classification criteria, the stomach was vertically divided into the upper one-third (U), middle one-third (M), and lower one-third (L) regions. Endoscopic features included lesion morphology (elevated, flat, depressed) and the presence of ulcers or scars on the lesion surface.

Anesthesiology (2019). High credibility.

Practice advisory — Postoperative management for high-risk patients advises assessing vision when the patient becomes alert, obtaining an urgent ophthalmologic consultation if there is concern for potential visual loss, considering computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging on a case-by-case basis to evaluate intracranial causes or an abnormal optic nerve, and that additional management may include optimizing hemoglobin or hematocrit, hemodynamic status, and arterial oxygenation.

### The effect of orthostatic hypotension detected pre-operatively on post-operative outcome [^115SxfoB]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Exacerbation of or new onset orthostatic hypotension in perioperative patients can occur. There is complex underlying pathophysiology with further derailment likely caused by acute cardiovascular changes associated with surgery. The implications for post-operative recovery are unclear, particularly in frail and older patients. We retrospectively explored patient notes for evidence of post-operative orthostatic intolerance in relation to pre-operative orthostatic hypotension.

Methods

Supine and 1-minute and 3-minute standing blood pressure measures obtained from adult patients before mainly general, orthopedic or uro/gynecology surgery were compared to post-operative outcome, specifically, evidence in patient notes about falls, feeling dizzy/unsteady and/or fearful to stand. Orthostatic hypotension was defined as a 20mmHg or more and/or 10mmHg or more fall in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, within ~3minutes of standing after lying supine for an electrocardiogram.

Results

Whilst all patients included had a 1-minute standing blood pressure assessment (N = 170), 3-minute assessment was performed less commonly (N = 113). Nevertheless, one-quarter (23.5%; N = 40) of 170 patients had pre-operative orthostatic hypotension. This was not clearly explained by cardiac or neurological disease or by common medications, but did occur more frequently in older patients and in those aged 65years or more with higher clinical frailty scale scores. The COVID-19 pandemic reduced the number of patients progressing to surgery within the planned study timescale (N = 143/170; 84.1%). Nevertheless, patients with orthostatic hypotension stayed longer in hospital post-operatively and were more likely to have an episode of fall, unsteadiness and/or dizziness documented (un-prompted) in their notes.

Conclusions

These data provide further impetus for research into modifiable perioperative risk factors associated with orthostatic hypotension. These risks are not confined to those with a pre-existing dysautonomia diagnosis.

### Postoperative visual loss associated with spine surgery [^112C1sQY]. European Spine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Postoperative visual loss associated with spine surgery is a rare complication with no established definitive etiology. Multiple case reports have been published in the literature, and an overview of the case reports of the various visual disturbances following spine surgery is presented. Our objective was to review the current literature and determine if there were any risk factors that suggest what kind of patients have a higher likelihood of developing postoperative visual loss. Furthermore, analysis of factors common to the cases may offer a better understanding of possible etiologies leading to prevention strategies of postoperative visual loss. We used PubMed to perform a search of literature with spine surgery cases that are associated with visual disturbances. A total of 7 studies representing 102 cases were reviewed and evaluated in regard to age, sex, comorbidities, diagnosis, operative time, blood loss, systolic blood pressure, lowest hematocrit, and visual deficits and improvement. Ischemic optic neuropathy, especially posterior ischemic optic neuropathy, was the most common diagnosis found in the studies. The average age of the patients ranged from 46.5 years to 53.3 years with the majority having at least one comorbidity. Operative time ranged on average from 385 min to 410 min with a median in one case series of 480 min, average blood loss ranged from 3.5 l to 4.3 l and no visual improvement was seen in the majority of the cases. The etiology of postoperative visual loss is probably multifactorial, however, patients with a large amount of blood loss producing hypotension and anemia along with prolonged operative times may be causing a greater risk in developing visual disturbances. An acute anemic state may have an additive or synergistic effect with other factors (medical comorbidities) leading to visual disturbances. Although our study failed to provide definitive causative factors of postoperative visual loss, suggestions are made that warrant further studies.

### Bupivacaine [^1126hgGH]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Adverse Reactions Reported in All Local Infiltration Clinical Studies in Adults

The safety of bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension (local administration into the surgical site) was evaluated in 10 randomized, double-blind, clinical studies (including Studies 1 and 2 [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]) that included 823 adult patients who had various surgical procedures. Patients were administered a bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension dose ranging from 66 to 532 mg (two times the maximum recommended dose of 266 mg). In these studies, following bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension administration, the: Most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10%) were nausea, constipation, and vomiting.
Common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 2% to less than 10%) were pyrexia, dizziness, peripheral edema, anemia, hypotension, pruritus, tachycardia, headache, insomnia, postoperative anemia, muscle spasms, hemorrhagic anemia, back pain, somnolence, and procedural pain.
Less common adverse reactions (incidence less than 2%) were chills, erythema, bradycardia, anxiety, urinary retention, pain, edema, tremor, postural dizziness, paresthesia, syncope, incision site edema, procedural hypertension, procedural hypotension, procedural nausea, muscular weakness, neck pain, generalized pruritus, pruritic rash, hyperhidrosis, cold sweat, urticaria, palpitations, sinus bradycardia, supraventricular extrasystoles, ventricular extrasystoles, ventricular tachycardia, hypertension, pallor, anxiety, confusional state, depression, agitation, restlessness, hypoxia, laryngospasm, apnea, respiratory depression, respiratory failure, increased body temperature, increased blood pressure (BP), decreased BP, decreased oxygen saturation, urinary incontinence, blurred vision, tinnitus, drug hypersensitivity, and hypersensitivity.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^112mxa3u]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

When should postoperative anaemia be treated?

There are limited supporting data regarding appropriate timing for management of anaemia after surgery, including red cell transfusion. Treatment choice depends on severity and type of anaemia, type of surgery, patient comorbidities and the presence of any surgical complications.

Iron supplementation should be considered in patients with iron deficiency or significant reduction in postoperative haemoglobin, starting early in the postoperative recovery phase where there are no major complications 39, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46. It is important to note that there are no studies identifying the best time to start postoperative iron supplementation.

For non‐cancer patients with severe postoperative anaemia and inflammation‐induced blunted erythropoiesis or those declining blood transfusion, additional treatment with an erythropoiesis‐stimulating agent (e.g. recombinant human erythropoietin [rHuEPO]) may be considered. However, we are aware that for patients without a previous indication this is an off‐label use of rHuEPO, and recommendations vary across countries 10, 12, 15.

Red cell transfusion should be restricted to patients with severe anaemia (haemoglobin < 70–80 g.l −1) and clinical signs and symptoms 7, 10, 11, 12, 47, 48, 49. Red cell transfusion should be considered in patients with active bleeding and in those severely anaemic once bleeding has been stopped 7, 10, 11, 12, 47, 48, 49. However, more research is required on specific transfusion thresholds in specific high‐risk patients.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: management of hip fractures in older adults [^111e8Xjj]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

Transfusion threshold in asymptomatic postoperative hip fracture patients — a blood transfusion threshold of no higher than 8g/dl is suggested in asymptomatic postoperative hip fracture patients, with Quality of Evidence: Moderate and Strength of Recommendation: Moderate. The Carson (2011) FOCUS trial is the largest (n = 2016) and showed that a restrictive transfusion threshold of hemoglobin 8g/dl resulted in no significant difference in primary or secondary outcomes at 30- or 60-days; Gregersen's (2015) study comparing 9.7g/dl vs. 11.3 g/dl also showed no significant difference in most outcomes. In these studies, blood was transfused 1 unit at a time and the patient reassessed for presence of symptoms or signs after each transfusion. Implementation is likely to result in lower transfusion associated complications and cost, but cognitively impaired patients may not report symptoms and warrant special attention. Confirmatory studies by other authors would strengthen evidence.

Anesthesiology (2019). High credibility.

Hemoglobin threshold note — The Task Force believes that there is no documented lower limit of hemoglobin concentration that has been associated with the development of perioperative visual loss, and therefore the Task Force believes a transfusion threshold that would eliminate the risk of perioperative visual loss related to anemia cannot be established at this time.

### Orthostatic hypotension occurs frequently in the first hour after anesthesia [^112KZyD4]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2004). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Symptoms of orthostatic intolerance are common after general anesthesia and are associated with an increased risk of postoperative morbidity. The contribution of orthostatic hypotension (OH) has not been well defined. We conducted a head-up tilt test on patients after general anesthesia for minor surgery to assess the incidence of and risk factors for OH after general anesthesia. One-hundred-four patients were enrolled and were prospectively divided into four groups: older female, older male, young female, and young male. The incidence of OH was 76.0%, 72.0%, 45.5%, and 62.5% respectively and was associated with increasing age (P < 0.05) and posttest dizziness (P < 0.05). Body mass index, preoperative blood pressure, ASA class, anesthetic duration, IV fluid administration, and use of analgesics and antiemetics in the postanesthetic care unit were not different in subjects who demonstrated OH compared with those with a normotensive response. Subjects with OH after general anesthesia did not increase their heart rate and diastolic blood pressure with a head-up tilt which may have been caused by persistent effects of anesthetics on reflex cardiovascular control and/or bedrest-induced dysregulation of reflex cardiovascular control. We conclude that OH is common after general anesthesia for minor surgery and may be the major cause of postoperative orthostatic intolerance.

Implications

Orthostatic hypotension, a failure to maintain blood pressure on assuming an upright posture, is common after general anesthesia for minor surgery and may be the major cause of postoperative orthostatic intolerance.

### Dysautonomia: perioperative implications [^112hCTha]. Anesthesiology (2012). Low credibility.

Severe autonomic failure occurs in approximately 1 in 1,000 people. Such patients are remarkable for the striking and sometimes paradoxic responses they manifest to a variety of physiologic and pharmacologic stimuli. Orthostatic hypotension is often the finding most commonly noted by physicians, but a myriad of additional and less understood findings also occur. These findings include supine hypertension, altered drug sensitivity, hyperresponsiveness of blood pressure to hypo/hyperventilation, sleep apnea, and other neurologic disturbances. In this article the authors will review the clinical pathophysiology that underlies autonomic failure, with a particular emphasis on those aspects most relevant to the care of such patients in the perioperative setting. Strategies used by clinicians in diagnosis and treatment of these patients, and the effect of these interventions on the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care that these patients undergo is a crucial element in the optimized management of care in these patients.

Anesthesiology (2019). High credibility.

Practice advisory — Management of blood loss and administration of fluids in high-risk patients recommends periodic monitoring of hemoglobin or hematocrit during surgery when substantial blood loss occurs, use of transfusions as deemed appropriate, and that crystalloids or colloids alone or in combination may be used to maintain adequate intravascular volume replacement. The Task Force states there is no documented lower hemoglobin limit associated with perioperative visual loss and therefore no transfusion threshold can be established to eliminate anemia-related risk.

Adverse Reactions Reported in All Local Infiltration Clinical Studies in Pediatric Patients Aged 6 to Less Than 17 Years

The safety of EXPAREL in 110 pediatric patients between the age of 6 and 17 years old who had spine or cardiac surgical procedures was evaluated in one randomized, open-label, clinical study in which EXPAREL was administered by infiltration into the surgical site (Study Peds-1) and one single-arm, open-label study in which EXPAREL was administered by infiltration into the surgical site (Study Peds-2) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Patients were administered a weight-based dose of EXPAREL at 4 mg/kg (maximum dose of 266 mg) or bupivacaine HCl 2 mg/kg (maximum dose of 175 mg).

In these studies, following EXPAREL administration the:

Most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10%) were nausea, vomiting, constipation, hypotension, anemia, muscle twitching, blurred vision, pruritus, and tachycardia.
Common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 2% to less than 10%) were bradycardia, muscle spasms, tachypnea, oral hypoesthesia, postoperative anemia, dizziness, pyrexia, diarrhea, hypoacusis, hypoesthesia, back pain, hematuria, incontinence, muscular weakness, and visual impairment.
Less common adverse reactions (incidence less than 2%) were flatulence, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, lip swelling, pain in extremity, musculoskeletal pain, flank pain, musculoskeletal chest pain, hypertension, sinus tachycardia, ventricular extrasystoles, dysgeusia, paresthesia, burning sensation, syncope, diplopia, eye swelling, dyspnea, atelectasis, hypopnea, hypoxia, chest pain, face edema, gait disturbance, generalized pruritus, rash, delayed recovery from anesthesia, fall, incision site hemorrhage, joint dislocation, seroma, hypomagnesemia, acidosis, hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, ear discomfort, decreased urine output, increased heart rate (HR), anxiety, panic attack, ear infection, and fungal wound infection.

Postoperative visual loss

Vision loss in the perioperative period is devastating and typically permanent. Those procedures most often affiliated are spine surgery and cardiac bypass surgery. However, any surgery in the prone position or where the head is placed lower than the heart for a prolonged period can result in post o perative v isual l oss (POVL). Although spine surgery constitutes the majority of claims, other reported cases include prostate, total hip and pilonidal cyst surgeries. Hydrostatic forces play a role when the eyes are lower than the heart. Furthermore, in the prone position, intraocular pressure rises considerably; however, this effect can be decreased by placing the patient in reverse Trendelenburg position. Other factors that may play a role in POVL are male gender, younger age, diabetes with an associated 'opathy' such as neuropathy, retinopathy or nephropathy, renal disease with resultant anemia, large volumes of crystalloid, significant blood loss or hypotension and cases lasting longer than 6 hours. Nonetheless, patients with similar risk factors and similar perioperative management yet sustain no POVL complicate the study of the phenomenon. Anatomic variation that cannot be seen by anesthesiologists may influence which patients develop this rare complication. When it comes to discussing POVL, either the surgeon and/or the anesthesiologist may cover informed consent; however, a study by Corda et al suggests that patients would prefer that surgeons address the issue of POVL before the day of surgery. Management of prolonged procedures should include staged surgeries when possible, avoiding hypotension and anemia (hemoglobin < 9.0), using central venous pressure monitoring in high-risk patients, keeping the head in neutral position above the level of the heart when possible and using colloids and vasopressors as needed.

### Role of perioperative fluid resuscitation in same-day total joint arthroplasty discharge at a level 1 academic center [^114tsQq4]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

The total fluids/BMI ratio may be a useful tool to help guide appropriate intraoperative fluid administration based on varying BMI ranges. In fact, patients with a total fluids/BMI ratio < 50 had a markedly increased risk of orthostatic hypotension during physical therapy, failing same-day physical therapy clearance, ambulation distance < 100 feet, and overnight admission. While patients of various ages and weights have differing fluid requirements, the total fluids/BMI ratio may be a guideline for providers to optimize intravascular resuscitation while avoiding unwarranted leg edema. Intraoperative fluid administration during surgical intervention may be more beneficial in postoperative recovery compared with reliance on oral replenishment in the recovery unit. Previous studies have found increased episodes of postoperative vomiting in patients undergoing TKA with a restrictive fluid protocol, and many patients experience postoperative nausea and vomiting precluding oral hydration after surgery. Intraoperative fluid optimization of TJA patients may be a more reliable and immediate method of decreasing instances of orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, dizziness, and fatigue that may preclude patients from working with physical therapy compared with relying on oral hydration in the recovery unit.

Although a total fluids/BMI ratio < 50 increased risk of orthostatic hypotension postoperatively, five patients who had a total fluids/BMI ratio of 73 were found to be hypertensive during physical therapy. These patients trended toward having a higher total urine output on the day of surgery, suggesting that overly aggressive resuscitation on the day of surgery may cause volume overload and increased cardiac demand. Although orthostatic hypotension is a common cause for inability to participate in physical therapy, increased hypertension may similarly lead to dizziness, extended blood pressure monitoring, and medication adjustments requiring overnight hospital stay. While the surgical estimated blood loss and preoperative dehydration status as measured using BUN/Cr levels were similar between groups, there is a fine balance between over-resuscitation and under-resuscitation that, in our study, is found between total fluids/BMI ratios of 50 and 70.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^113pJkoV]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

What are the confounding factors?

In the setting of postoperative care, a number of confounding factors may impact on accurate haemoglobin measurement. Volume overload and haemodilution after major surgery are potential causes for low haemoglobin levels, despite normal and stable red cell mass. Therefore, the diagnosis of anaemia based on simple haemoglobin concentration may be misleading, and is confounded by plasma volume derangements, resulting in significant overdiagnosis 37. Potential volume overload should be taken into account, and may improve after diuresis.

Similar conditions may be present in the peri‐operative setting where prevention of intravascular volume deficit is a cornerstone of peri‐operative management. Here, intravascular volume and fluid therapy are fundamental whenever fasting is indicated for medical reasons; in the event of high‐fluid turnover rates during major surgery, or in cases of reduced enteral resorption due to sustained vomiting, severe diarrhoea or gastro‐intestinal dysfunction following circulatory shock. The primary aim of intravenous fluid therapy (crystalloid and colloid solutions) is the restoration of plasma and blood volume to ensure appropriate cardiac output and tissue perfusion.

Unfortunately, appropriate assessment of volume status is complex. The diagnosis or quantification of moderate‐to‐severe volume deficit and volume responsiveness remains difficult, and may be attempted using laboratory variables (e.g. lactate, base excess), positional manoeuvres (passive lifting of legs), new monitoring devices (measuring pulse variability and stroke volume indexes or other preload variables) or echocardiography. Recent guidelines highlight the importance of avoiding hypervolaemia 7. During postoperative recovery, redistribution and excretion of fluids may lead to rapid recovery of haemodilution‐induced low haemoglobin concentrations.

### Misconceptions and facts about orthostatic hypotension [^113X16Sj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is a highly prevalent medical condition that is an independent risk factor for falls and mortality. It reflects a condition in which autonomic reflexes are impaired or intravascular volume is depleted, causing a significant reduction in blood pressure upon standing. This disorder is frequently unrecognized until later in its clinical course. Symptoms like orthostatic dizziness do not reliably identify patients with orthostatic hypotension, who are often asymptomatic, leading further to the difficulty of this diagnosis. We summarize seven clinically important misconceptions about orthostatic hypotension.

### Visual loss after orthopedic procedures [^115YDizi]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2011). Low credibility.

Perioperative visual loss (PVL) is a very rare and unpredictable complication of surgery performed at distance from the visual pathways, mostly after spine or cardiac procedures. We report 6 consecutive patients with PVL after routine orthopedic procedures (osteosynthesis for complex fracture of the femur [2], total hip arthroplasty [2], hip prosthesis arthroplasty [1], bilateral simultaneous total knee arthroplasty [1]) and reviewed the literature on the subject. An ischemic optic neuropathy was diagnosed in all cases, and visual loss was bilateral in 5 of 6 patients. Partial visual improvement occurred in only 3 of 11 eyes. No specific therapy is available for PVL. Postoperative visual disturbances should prompt without delay an ophthalmic evaluation because emergent correction of anemia, systemic hypotension, or hypovolemia might improve visual prognosis of PVL.

Other analyses have reported uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of iron therapy while citing a need for improved evidence. For example, in a systematic review and meta-analysis, Shah et alreported no conclusive evidence that IV iron improves clinically important outcomes in nonelective surgery. A Cochrane review of iron therapy for preoperative anemia concluded that iron therapy did not produce a clinically significant reduction in the proportion of patients receiving an ABT compared with no iron therapy. Compared with oral iron, IV iron was associated with greater increases in Hb and ferritin, but the evidence for this was not considered reliable.

Data from 2006 show that the rates of adverse reactions to IV iron are low, at around 40 per million doses of low-molecular weight iron dextran and 130 per million doses of high-molecular weight iron dextran administered in the United States. The reported reactions included dyspnea, chest pain, and hypotension. Some reactions (eg, anaphylaxis) are potentially life-threatening, but these are rare (the incidence of anaphylaxis has been reported to be < 4 per million doses). A recent meta-analysis reported an increased risk of infection with IV iron versus "no iron or oral iron", but the extent of this increase was modest [relative risk, 1.16 (95% CI, 1.03–1.29)] and statistical significance was not observed when comparing IV iron with "no iron" alone or "oral iron" alone.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^116KV1rN]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

How should patients be treated postoperatively?

Pharmacological optimisation of postoperative haemoglobin and erythropoiesis should allow correction of iron deficiency and rapid recovery from postoperative anaemia, which may lead to improved postoperative outcomes and improved quality of life. It may also result in a reduction of patient exposure to red cell transfusion and its related risk and complications, thus contributing further to improving surgical outcome and patient safety.

Iron therapy: oral vs. i.v. iron?

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK (NICE) recommends offering oral iron after surgery to patients with iron deficiency anaemia 12. However, in the postoperative period, oral iron is often not tolerated or absorbed and has several limitations including frequent gastro‐intestinal side‐effects and, as a consequence, poor treatment adherence. Additionally, the inflammatory response induced by surgery stimulates hepcidin synthesis and release, which in turn inhibits intestinal iron absorption, making oral iron therapy largely ineffective 10, 13, 50. Various randomised placebo‐controlled trials (RCT) in orthopaedic and cardiac surgery patients have demonstrated that oral iron therapy was not better than placebo in correcting postoperative anaemia and reducing transfusion requirements 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57.

On the other hand, NICE recommends considering i.v. iron after surgery for patients who have iron deficiency anaemia and cannot tolerate or absorb oral iron, or are unable to adhere to oral iron treatment, as well as for those who are diagnosed with functional iron deficiency 12. Thus, patients presenting with postoperative iron deficiency and/or moderate‐to‐severe postoperative anaemia (haemoglobin < 100 g.l −1) may benefit from i.v. iron supplementation, which has proven to be more effective than oral iron in a number of surgical settings (Supporting Information online, Appendix S1) 39, 42, 43, 44, 45, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63. Most recent RCTs have shown improved outcomes following high‐dose postoperative i.v. iron (e.g. 1000 mg) as demonstrated by increased haemoglobin and/or reduction in transfusion requirements, and no i.v. iron‐related serious adverse events were reported (Supporting Information, Appendix S1) 39, 42, 44, 45. Importantly, in orthopaedic surgical patients with postoperative haemoglobin < 100 g.l −1 and/or uncorrected pre‐operative iron deficiency (ferritin < 100 μg.l −1), a greater rise in haemoglobin and better scores for 'usual activities' were observed with high‐dose i.v. iron compared with oral iron 42.

Diagnosis of postoperative anaemia

When and how to measure haemoglobin concentration?

Measurement of haemoglobin concentration is a routine procedure in postoperative care. Duration of testing for postoperative anaemia depends on the peri‐operative bleeding risk associated with the surgical intervention and patient‐dependent factors. In most cases of uncomplicated recovery from surgery, a nadir in haemoglobin concentration can be observed within the first 3–4 days after surgery. In patients with major complications following major surgery, however, prolonged hospitalisation and exposure to low haemoglobin levels increase the duration of monitoring required.

Usually, blood gas analysis, capillary sampling (e.g. HemoCue, HemoCue AB, Ängelholm, Sweden) or near‐infrared spectroscopy (e.g. Radical‐67, Masimo Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA) are performed as a point‐of‐care assessment, whereas the full blood count is tested in the central laboratory. The use of non‐invasive continuous haemoglobin monitoring devices instead of phlebotomy may reduce blood loss, pain and discomfort for the patient, but concerns about precision limit routine clinical use. Although the debate focuses on accuracy of a single check 35, the reliability of non‐invasive haemoglobin monitoring devices for dynamic changes over time may permit detection of occult bleeding and response to therapy 36.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^111TQxDJ]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

What are the unmet medical needs of postoperative anaemia?

The concerns surrounding postoperative anaemia relate to its potential impact on recovery, rehabilitation, hospital re‐admission or re‐operation, and patient well‐being. Reducing allogeneic blood transfusion improves long‐term outcome and survival 27. However, restrictive transfusion protocols have led to patients being discharged with lower haemoglobin levels than before. With the current paucity of data, it remains unclear whether a lower discharge haemoglobin level may allow optimal functional recovery and quality of life 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34. There has been limited research on the consequences of postoperative anaemia in the recovery phase from surgery, with only a small number of studies after cardiac and hip and knee surgery, which demonstrated the association between postoperative anaemia and adverse outcomes such as prolonged recovery, increased mortality and likelihood of re‐admission 31, 32, 33. Postoperative anaemia may also potentially be associated with early postoperative myocardial infarction 34. Correction of postoperative anaemia, as suggested in this consensus statement, is intended to prevent such side‐effects, but studies are urgently needed to prove this.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^117CfN5G]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

When and how to measure postoperative iron deficiency?

Although underlying causes of postoperative anaemia are multifactorial, iron deficiency is often present. Although pre‐operative iron deficiency can be diagnosed on the basis of low ferritin concentrations 4, diagnosis of postoperative iron deficiency is more difficult, as ferritin levels may be elevated as part of the acute phase inflammatory response after surgery 38. Thus, patients undergoing major surgery with a high risk of developing moderate‐to‐severe postoperative anaemia should have their haemoglobin and iron status checked on the day of surgery, if it has not been already performed in the pre‐operative assessment. This may also apply to patients with ongoing bleeding and anaemia (e.g. colorectal cancer) that have been treated in the pre‐operative period. As ferritin levels will not be elevated by inflammation immediately after surgery, a postoperative ferritin concentration < 100 μg.l −1 within 24 h after surgery indicates insufficient iron stores to support erythropoiesis with the potential for significant falls in postoperative haemoglobin 8.

Further markers of postoperative iron deficiency are transferrin saturation < 20% with ferritin concentrations 100–300 μg.l −1, or reticulocyte haemoglobin content < 28 pg. These values and parameters may signal the need for intervention in anaemic patients 38, 39, 40, 41.

Suggestions for further research

During the writing of this consensus statement, it became apparent that there are areas of postoperative anaemia management for which further research is required:
Monitoring. It is really important to emphasise the need for detailed anaemia studies following discharge with periodic monitoring of haemoglobin and iron parameters in relation to functional recovery.
Interventions. More data and clinical trials are required to firmly establish the impact of postoperative anaemia management strategies (i.v. iron vs. oral iron, rHuEPO, red cell transfusion and nutritional support) on functional recovery and quality of life; on end‐points in addition to laboratory end‐points, such as haemoglobin increase; and interventional end‐points, such as reduction or avoidance of red cell transfusion. Further research is required to assess the effects of correction of iron deficiency, with or without anaemia, on platelet counts, platelet activation and thromboembolic events, especially in the elderly. Timing of interventions in the postoperative course needs to be addressed in future trials. Dosing of anti‐anaemia treatment and combination of means of treatment must be systematically investigated.
Patients. It is also necessary to define which patient groups are most likely to benefit from such treatments.
Mechanisms of action. The mechanisms underlying non‐erythropoietic effects of rHuEPO, such as neurological and renal protective effects, and iron need to be elucidated.
Cost. The cost effectiveness of postoperative anaemia correction must be investigated at the different time‐points for its administration, using formal cost evaluation. Until such data are available, the predominant signal from available publications and peer reviewed recommendation support the concept of postoperative anaemia screening, diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

### Role of phlebotomy in the management of hemoglobin SC disease: case report and review of the literature [^111MTXNC]. American Journal of Hematology (2003). Low credibility.

Marked variability is a keynote in the disease course of patients with hemoglobin SC (Hb SC) and hemoglobin S/beta(+)-thalassemia (Hb S/beta(+)-thal), with some patients having a frequency of complications and painful episodes similar to patients with homozygous sickle cell (Hb SS) disease. One possible explanation is that the higher hematocrit in these syndromes may contribute to an increase in blood viscosity, leading to vaso-occlusive pain episodes as well as an increased incidence of thromboembolic complications and retinopathy. We present a patient with Hb SC disease with an excellent baseline functional status who developed splenic infarction at a high altitude. Following splenectomy, the patient developed a sustained increase in hematocrit, an increase in the frequency of painful episodes, as well as new-onset dizziness and malaise. We initiated a therapeutic phlebotomy program in order to lower the hematocrit to pre-splenectomy values, as well as to induce iron deficiency. Repeated phlebotomy resulted in a dramatic decrease in symptoms. Our patient no longer requires narcotic analgesics for pain, has resolution of constitutional symptoms, and has not required further hospitalizations for vaso-occlusive pain crises. The correlation between symptoms and hematocrit levels supports the importance of blood viscosity in contributing to this patient's symptoms. A trial of phlebotomy to reduce viscosity in patients with higher hematocrit values should be considered as an intervention for symptomatic patients with sickle cell disease.

### The factors determining early mobilization in elderly patients undergoing total knee replacement [^1148GjHf]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this research, our findings indicate that the age of TKR patients, preoperative ASA score, pre- and post-TKR pain and muscle strength, nausea on the operative day, preoperative blood pressure levels, and post-TKR surgery drops in blood pressure were significantly different between EM(-) and EM(+) groups. Early mobilization (EM) following TKR might be associated with a reduction in the LOS without increase risk of falls.

The significant changes of blood pressure resulting in postoperative hypotension, orthostatic intolerance (drowsiness, dizziness, blurred vision, nausea, or syncope) and orthostatic hypotension (OH) may impede early mobilization after major orthopedic surgeries. Orthostatic hypotension, i.e. postural hypotension after transitioning from supine posture to sitting/standing, is common in older patients, but is often overlooked and is not closely evaluated in regular clinical practices after TKR. In a control group of patients who received joint arthroplasty, 22.5–39.7% experienced orthostatic intolerance, adverse mobilization event, or OH. The postoperative blood pressure may be affected by pain, medications, hypovolemia caused by dehydration and blood loss, as well as postoperative systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Although OH was not directly measured in this cohort, the blood pressure drop after TKR in both groups at POD0 and POD1 was assessed. A prior study reported a 16- to 20-mm Hg drop in postoperative SBP after THR, which was greater than that seen in our patients. In the present study, the drop in SBP in the EM(-) group was greater than the decrease of SBP in the EM(+) group on POD0 and POD1 after TKR. Therefore, patients may decline early mobilization due to fear of falling, which may be caused by subclinical OH. Ten milligrams oral alpha-adrenoceptor agonist, midodrine hydrochloride, would help patients undergoing total joint replacement to achieve a significant SBP elevation at 2 h after administration and decrease adverse mobilization events postoperatively. We speculate that if the participants had achieved better control of blood pressure after TKR to avoid a significant drop in SBP while transitioning their position, the success rate of postoperative early mobilization would have been higher in this cohort. Based on the findings that the drop in SBP was greater in the EM(-) group compared to the EM(+) group on POD0 and POD1 after TKR, minimizing rapid drops in blood pressure might improve the success rate of early mobilization in post-TKR patients. Changes in blood pressure after TKR should be closely monitored, and antihypertensive medications ought to be used cautiously to prevent postoperative hypotension. However, further research is needed to explore this issue.

### Recommendations from the international consensus conference on anemia management in surgical patients (ICCAMS) [^113adLbW]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Anemia is common in surgical patients and the need to proceed with surgery in some patients with this condition is expected to persist in the near future. However, anemia is associated with worsened clinical outcomes and it may be a modifiable risk factor. We report consensus recommendations from an international group of experts. The panel recommended that patients should be screened for anemia before surgery, with accurate diagnosis of the etiology enabling initiation of the most appropriate preoperative therapy. In patients with IDA, IV iron is generally preferable to oral iron in the preoperative setting. As with preoperative anemia, postoperative anemia should be treated early (ie, initiated before discharge from hospital). Given the high prevalence of anemia, early identification and effective treatment of this condition have the potential to improve clinical outcomes.

### How I treat anemia in the perisurgical setting [^115tZ7BY]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

Anemia is a common finding in the perioperative setting with significant untoward consequences including worsening of outcomes and diminished quality of life as well as increased risk of allogeneic blood transfusions. Here, we present 3 cases that illustrate how anemia can be perioperatively managed in patients undergoing cardiac, orthopedic, and oncology surgeries. Timely detection of anemia prior to high-blood loss surgeries can allow clinicians to manage it and optimize hemoglobin level, making patients better prepared for the surgery. Treatment of anemia should be guided by the etiology and may include erythropoietic agents, folic acid, B12, and iron preparations. Other blood management strategies geared toward reducing surgical blood loss such as autologous transfusion techniques and agents to optimize hemostasis are used during surgery and in the immediate postoperative period. Patients should be closely monitored following surgery for signs of ongoing bleeding in need of control. Finally, screening for and management of anemia should continue in the postoperative and postdischarge period, as persistence and recurrence of anemia can further undermine patient's outcomes.

### Postoperative anemia and exercise tolerance after cardiac operations in patients without transfusion: what hemoglobin level is acceptable? [^1136Uu1L]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Restrictive transfusion strategies have been suggested for cardiac surgical patients, leading to various degrees of postoperative anemia. This study investigates the exercise tolerance during rehabilitation of cardiac surgical patients who did not receive transfusions, with respect to their level of postoperative anemia.

Methods

This observational study started in January 2010 and ended in May 2010 in 2 rehabilitation hospitals and 2 large-volume cardiac surgical hospitals. The study population was 172 patients who did not receive transfusions during cardiac surgical operations with cardiopulmonary bypass and subsequently followed a rehabilitation program in 1 of the 2 rehabilitation hospitals. No patient received a transfusion during the rehabilitation hospital stay. Exercise tolerance was measured using the 6-minute walk test at admission and discharge from the rehabilitation hospital. The level of anemia at admission to the rehabilitation hospital was tested as an independent predictor of exercise tolerance within a model inclusive of other possible confounders.

Results

Patients with values of hemoglobin less than 10 g/dL at admission to the rehabilitation institute had a significantly (p = 0.007) worse performance on the 6-minute walk test than patients with higher values (258 ± 106 vs 306 ± 101 meters). This functional gap was completely recovered during a normal rehabilitation period. Other independent factors affecting exercise tolerance were age, sex, and albumin concentration.

Conclusions

Postoperative anemia with hemoglobin levels of 8 to 10 g/dL is well tolerated in patients who have not received a transfusion and induces only a transient impairment of exercise tolerance.

Red blood cell transfusion: transfusion thresholds for whom and when?

Allogeneic red cell transfusion is associated with a significant increase in peri‐operative morbidity and mortality 2, 98, 99, 100. In addition, there is a worldwide shortage of blood, with substantial associated costs to the manufacturer and health systems 101. Moreover, red cell transfusion risks infectious, immunological, haemolytic, non‐haemolytic adverse reactions, cardiac and pulmonary complications 2, 98. Despite successful implementation of PBM programmes, red cell transfusion is still widely used as a default treatment for the majority of patients with acute postoperative anaemia 102.

Historically, the standard for red cell transfusion was a liberal transfusion threshold, namely haemoglobin level < 100 g.l −1 (or haematocrit < 30%). This arbitrary transfusion threshold has been gradually lowered towards haemoglobin 70–80 g.l −1, according to data derived from a number of RCTs evaluating the effect on patient outcomes of restrictive vs. more liberal red cell transfusion strategies in a variety of clinical settings. When subjected to pooled analysis in several systematic reviews and meta‐analyses (Supporting Information online, Appendix S2) 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, data from these RCTs show that, in terms of morbidity and mortality, a restrictive red cell transfusion strategy is equivalent to or more beneficial than a liberal strategy 101, 109.

In addition, evidence‐based guidelines have translated the results of RCTs and meta‐analyses into clinical practice 7, 10, 11, 12, 47, 48, 49. One of the most recently published guidelines on red cell transfusion thresholds recommends a restrictive red cell transfusion threshold (haemoglobin < 70 g.l −1) for hospitalised adult patients who are haemodynamically stable, including critically ill patients 49. However, a transfusion threshold of at least 80 g.l −1 is suggested for patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery, cardiac or oncological surgery, and those with pre‐existing cardiovascular disease 12, 49, 110, 111. Nevertheless, transfusion of red cells for higher haemoglobin levels should be evaluated case by case, considering acute ongoing blood loss, comorbidities and signs of organ ischaemia or symptoms indicative of hypoxia. In any case, published guidelines agree that red cell transfusion is not beneficial when haemoglobin is > 100 g.l −1 7, 10, 11, 12, 47, 48, 49, 112. Confounding factors on haemoglobin levels have to be considered, as discussed above.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^112GLSj1]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

How does this consensus statement differ from other available statements and/or guidelines?

There are a number of statements and guidelines from professional associations recommending a systematic approach to this problem for the management of pre‐operative anaemia 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Most of these guidelines also recommend the use of a restrictive transfusion threshold for treating acute postoperative anaemia, but recommendations for pharmacological management of anaemia are scarce, or even absent 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. We aimed to update and utilise these few current recommendations to provide a working practice document, based on scientific evidence and the clinical experience of an expert panel, on 'how to' feasibly introduce these postoperative anaemia guidelines into clinical practice. Our goal was to provide pragmatic, clear and easy‐to‐follow clinical guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of postoperative anaemia and iron deficiency in order to improve patient recovery, reduce the need for blood transfusion and improve functional outcomes in a cost effective manner. Our recommendations are intended for non‐actively bleeding adult patients in whom all the principles of PBM have been implemented pre‐ and intra‐operatively for the prevention of postoperative iron deficiency and anaemia.

### Ischemic optic neuropathy after carotid body tumor resection [^112T6U7k]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Incidence estimates for postoperative vision loss after nonocular surgery range from 0.013% for all surgeries up to 0.2% following spine surgery. The most common neuro-ophthalmologic causes of postoperative vision loss are the ischemic optic neuropathies (IONs), either anterior or posterior. This complication of case reports suggests that a combination of prolonged surgery in the prone position, decreased ocular perfusion pressure, blood loss and anemia/hemodilution, and infusion of large quantities of intravenous fluids are some of the potential factors involved in the etiology of postoperative ION. The specific pathogenesis and risk factors underlying these neuro-ophthalmic complications remain unknown, and physicians should be alert to the potential for loss of vision in the postoperative period. We report the only cases of ION after carotid body tumor resection in the literature and review current theories regarding the etiology and diagnosis of vision loss.

### Should transfusion trigger thresholds differ for critical care versus perioperative patients? A meta-analysis of randomized trials [^1171rChJ]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Thus, the implications are clear that a restrictive transfusion strategy (transfusion trigger 7–8 g/dL, unless otherwise symptomatic) is recommended for critical care patients, with the evidence being less clear for surgical patients. Important limitations to our analysis include the moderate-to-high risk of bias of all included studies and possibility of publication bias among the perioperative studies. The specific GRADE recommendations corresponding to each of the outcomes of interest are located in the Summary of Findings Table (Table S3, Supplemental Digital Content 10; legend, Supplemental Digital Content 11). In general and in reference to Table S3, the quality of evidence for each outcome ranged from moderate to low.

For surgical patients, the perioperative setting offers different challenges in managing blood transfusion. Patients undergoing surgery have different risks than the critically ill, including surgery-related blood loss, vasoregulatory changes from anesthesia, and fluid shifts that are inherent to complex surgical procedures. Therefore, the acuity and time course of oxygen demands in perioperative patients may differ from those who are critically ill. For the outcome of 30-day mortality, the test for interaction between perioperative and critically ill patients was significant, suggesting that the direction of the effect sizes differ. Furthermore, subgroup analysis of low risk of bias perioperative studies, as well as those employing restrictive transfusion triggers of 7–7.5 g/dL (compared to 8 g/dL or higher), did demonstrate a higher risk of 30-day mortality. Taken together, these findings may potentially place perioperative patients at an increased risk of 30-day mortality with a restrictive transfusion strategy. Given divergent effect sizes and the low power in the accumulated sample size for surgical patients, our analysis calls into question the current American Society of Anesthesiologists guidelines, which advocate for a restrictive transfusion threshold in perioperative patients. In addition, our findings provide reason to reassess the American Association of Blood Banks recommendations related to surgery, which suggest that "a restrictive RBC transfusion threshold of 8 g/dL is recommended for patients undergoing orthopedic surgery, cardiac surgery, and those with preexisting cardiovascular disease (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). The restrictive transfusion threshold of 7 g/dL is likely comparable with 8 g/dL, but RCT evidence is not available for all patient categories".

Fortunately, relevant research is ongoing, including the international Transfusion Requirements in Cardiac Surgery III trial of cardiac surgery patients randomized to restrictive versus liberal transfusion thresholds (NCT02042898), which should help to clarify the appropriate threshold in this subgroup.

### Restrictive versus liberal transfusion strategy for red blood cell transfusion: systematic review of randomised trials with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^117LzcGt]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Unanswered questions

Whether the overall use of red blood cells should be guided by a restrictive or a liberal transfusion strategy is still debatable. Patients with coronary artery disease, and in particular patients with ongoing cardiac ischaemia, might require a higher haemoglobin level to sustain oxygen delivery to the myocardial cells and to reduce the sympathetically mediated compensatory mechanisms of anaemia and reduce myocardial oxygen demand. However, red blood cell transfusion could worsen patient outcome as a result of an increased risk of circulatory overload and increased thrombogenicity with higher haematocrit levels. Results from the FOCUS trial showed no association with the primary composite outcome of morbidity and mortality 60 days postoperatively or the incidence of coronary syndrome when comparing two transfusion strategies (8 g/dL (or symptoms of anaemia) versus 10 g/dL). Two small randomised controlled trials evaluating a restrictive transfusion trigger of haemoglobin < 8 g/dL in patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease have been published; pooled data from these two trials randomising a total of 155 patients did not show an association between a restrictive transfusion strategy and cardiac events or mortality compared with a liberal transfusion strategy. A meta-analysis including observational studies on transfusion in patients with myocardial infarction indicates that the rates of subsequent myocardial infarction and all cause mortality may be associated with blood transfusions compared with standard supportive interventions, after adjustment for possible confounding variables. Large randomised controlled trials of restrictive compared with liberal transfusion are warranted in patients with myocardial infarction.

Patients with traumatic brain injury may require more liberal transfusion strategies to prevent secondary cerebral ischaemic insults because the injured brain may not compensate for decreased oxygen delivery associated with anaemia. One randomised controlled trial using a factorial design compared the effects of erythropoietin and two different haemoglobin thresholds for red blood cell transfusion (7 versus 10 g/dL) in 200 patients with a closed head injury and showed no difference in neurological outcome at six months. Also in patients with acute brain injury data from high quality randomised controlled trials are needed to guide transfusion practice.

### Liberal or restrictive transfusion in high-risk patients after hip surgery [^1129zSzG]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

The hemoglobin threshold at which postoperative red-cell transfusion is warranted is controversial. We conducted a randomized trial to determine whether a higher threshold for blood transfusion would improve recovery in patients who had undergone surgery for hip fracture.

Methods

We enrolled 2016 patients who were 50 years of age or older, who had either a history of or risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and whose hemoglobin level was below 10 g per deciliter after hip-fracture surgery. We randomly assigned patients to a liberal transfusion strategy (a hemoglobin threshold of 10 g per deciliter) or a restrictive transfusion strategy (symptoms of anemia or at physician discretion for a hemoglobin level of < 8 g per deciliter). The primary outcome was death or an inability to walk across a room without human assistance on 60-day follow-up.

Results

A median of 2 units of red cells were transfused in the liberal-strategy group and none in the restrictive-strategy group. The rates of the primary outcome were 35.2% in the liberal-strategy group and 34.7% in the restrictive-strategy group (odds ratio in the liberal-strategy group, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.84 to 1.22), for an absolute risk difference of 0.5 percentage points (95% CI, -3.7 to 4.7). The rates of in-hospital acute coronary syndrome or death were 4.3% and 5.2%, respectively (absolute risk difference, -0.9%; 99% CI, -3.3 to 1.6), and rates of death on 60-day follow-up were 7.6% and 6.6%, respectively (absolute risk difference, 1.0%; 99% CI, -1.9 to 4.0). The rates of other complications were similar in the two groups.

Conclusions

A liberal transfusion strategy, as compared with a restrictive strategy, did not reduce rates of death or inability to walk independently on 60-day follow-up or reduce in-hospital morbidity in elderly patients at high cardiovascular risk.

### Open repair remains the gold standard [^1169SJCz]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Medium credibility.

Postoperative Management

Standard intensive care monitoring and volume resuscitation form the cornerstone of postoperative care in patients with TAAA. The mean arterial pressure is maintained between 80 and 100 mm Hg, and the patient's neurologic status is checked every hour. The patient's hemoglobin level is kept at or above 10 g/dL. The CSF drain can be removed between 48 and 72 hours postoperatively if there are no spinal deficits. The CSF drain is usually clamped for 8 to 12 hours before removal. The patient may be extubated the day after surgery and slowly started on a solid diet on postoperative day 4. Typically, patients are discharged 7 to 10 days after open repair. Higher mean arterial pressure goals are maintained for 4 to 6 weeks after surgery to prevent late neurologic complications.

### Perioperative visual loss after nonocular surgeries [^114WvJCX]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

To review the current knowledge of persistent visual loss after nonocular surgeries under general anesthesia.

Design

Perspective.

Methods

Literature review.

Results

The incidence of perioperative visual loss after nonocular surgeries ranges from 0.002% of all surgeries to as high as 0.2% of cardiac and spine surgeries. Any portion of the visual pathways may be involved, from the corneas to the occipital lobes, but the most common site of permanent injury is the optic nerves, and the most often presumed mechanism is ischemia. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) is more prevalent among cardiac surgery patients and posterior ischemic optic neuropathy (PION) predominates among those who have had spine and neck procedures. Patients range from age five to 81 years and typically awake with severe bilateral visual loss. Multiple factors have been proposed as risk factors for perioperative ION, including long duration in the prone position, excessive blood loss, hypotension, anemia, hypoxia, excessive fluid replacement, use of vasoconstricting agents, elevated venous pressure, head positioning, and a patient-specific vascular susceptibility that may be anatomic or physiologic. However, the risk factors for any given patient or procedure may vary and are likely multifactorial.

Conclusions

If, when an ophthalmologist is consulted for a patient with perioperative visual loss, an obvious ocular cause is not apparent, urgent neuroimaging should be obtained to rule out intracranial pathology. Anterior and posterior ION should be considered and careful documentation is essential. Currently, the pathogenesis of perioperative ION remains unclear, and preventive and therapeutic measures remain elusive.

### The factors determining early mobilization in elderly patients undergoing total knee replacement [^112XpfDu]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Various factors were reported to hinder TKR patients participating in early mobilization out of bed, including advanced age, body weight, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, cognitive abilities, wound pain, swelling, postoperative nausea/vomiting (PONV), dizziness, low blood pressure, or postoperative acute delirium. Proper pain management strategies effectively alleviated postoperative pain along with PONV and encouraged patients to comply with immediate rehabilitation exercises after TKR. However, there are inconsistent findings in the literature on the leading factors and it has been suggested that sex, age, body mass index (BMI), and ASA score did not influence patients' early mobilization after surgery. A consensus has not been reached regarding the determining factors of EM within 24 h and the results are still conflicting.

Excessive blood loss after TKR, typically ranging from 886 to 1,450 mL, is common and can lead to post-operative hypovolemia and hypotension, which should be managed using some postoperative protocols or medication. Significant changes in blood pressure, leading to postoperative hypotension, drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, syncope or orthostatic hypotension (OH), may hinder early mobilization following major orthopedic surgeries. However, the real hypotension was uncommon after TKR. Furthermore, previous research has not elucidated whether blood pressure changes after TKR influence a patient's EM. Clarifying the relevant factors affecting post-TKR mobilization capacity is crucial to provide clinicians with information that may help address the changes in perioperative factors and to further adjust them, thereby enhancing the benefits of early mobilization after TKR.

This study aims to explore the determining factors affecting successful early mobilization after primary TKR and assess the relative outcomes associated with early mobilization, including the risk of falls and length of stay. We hypothesized that maintaining post-operative blood pressure without significant decreases of blood pressure is associated with successful mobilization within 24 h of surgery, and that early mobilization could reduce LOS without increasing fall risk after TKR surgery.

### Recommendations from the international consensus conference on anemia management in surgical patients (ICCAMS) [^117DDUTY]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Perioperative anemia has been associated with increased risk of red blood cell transfusion and increased morbidity and mortality after surgery. The optimal approach to the diagnosis and management of perioperative anemia is not fully established.

Objective

To develop consensus recommendations for anemia management in surgical patients.

Methods

An international expert panel reviewed the current evidence and developed recommendations using modified RAND Delphi methodology.

Results

The panel recommends that all patients except those undergoing minor procedures be screened for anemia before surgery. Appropriate therapy for anemia should be guided by an accurate diagnosis of the etiology. The need to proceed with surgery in some patients with anemia is expected to persist. However, early identification and effective treatment of anemia has the potential to reduce the risks associated with surgery and improve clinical outcomes. As with preoperative anemia, postoperative anemia should be treated in the perioperative period.

Conclusions

Early identification and effective treatment of anemia has the potential to improve clinical outcomes in surgical patients.

Preprocedure preparation blood management protocols — Multimodal protocols or algorithms may be employed as strategies to reduce the usage of blood products, although no single algorithm or protocol can be recommended at this time. A restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy may be safely used to reduce transfusion administration, with determination of whether hemoglobin concentrations between 6 and 10g/dl justify or require red blood cell transfusion based on bleeding, volume status, signs of organ ischemia, and cardiopulmonary reserve; red blood cells should be administered unit‑by‑unit, when possible, with interval reevaluation. A protocol for avoidance of transfusion may be used for patients in whom transfusion is refused or not possible, and transfusion of red blood cells is rarely necessary when the hemoglobin concentration is more than 10g/dl.

### Intraoperative transfusion practices in Europe [^115wCz24]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Across Europe, the vast majority of elective surgical patients receiving one or more units of RBC intraoperatively are anaemic at the commencement of surgery (Hb 10.6 g dL −1), and correction of anaemia before surgery deserves further study. Although the transfusion trigger (Hb 8.1 g dL −1) is probably appropriate intraoperatively, post-transfusion Hb values were uniformly high (Hb 9.8 g dL −1) suggesting opportunity to use a single unit transfusion stratagem. Physiological transfusion triggers seem to be the most important catalyst for transfusion intraoperatively. But the physiological triggers mainly used (hypotension and tachycardia) might have a low discriminative power for tissue hypoperfusion and often occur at Hb values that are considered safe for tissue oxygenation in most patients.

Table 1
Hemoglobin levels to diagnose anemia at sea level (g/l)

Anemia in the perioperative period and in critically ill patients is a particular problem. The rate of preoperative anemia depends on age, sex, comorbidity and surgical pathology and can reach up to 75%. Despite such a high prevalence in clinical practice, preoperative anemia has long been perceived as a relatively minor problem that can be easily eliminated by blood transfusion. Meanwhile, numerous clinical trials suggest that preoperative anemia is associated with poor outcomes and increased mortality in both cardiac and non-cardiac surgery patients. Transfusion of RBCs remains the most common approach for perioperative anemia treatment. Thus, the American Red Cross reports that nearly 16 million blood components units are transfused annually in the United States, with approximately 29,000 units of RBCs needed daily.

Table 2
Clinical trials demonstrating the impact of blood transfusion on clinical outcomes

As shown in Table 2, blood transfusion has varying effects on clinical outcomes — both improvement outcomes and an increase in the risks of adverse outcomes. A similar situation arises in studies comparing restrictive and liberal transfusion strategies. For example, in the randomized 'Transfusion Requirements in Critical Care (TRICC)'trial, a restrictive strategy showed a similar 30-day mortality compared to a liberal strategy in critically ill patients. However, mortality in the restrictive group was significantly lower among the subgroups- patients with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of ≤ 20 and younger patients (less than 55 years) and was also lower during hospitalization. Nevertheless, there was no difference in mortality among patients with cardiac pathology. In accordance, another multicenter randomized trial demonstrated an identical mortality rate in septic shock patients between a liberal and restrictive transfusion strategy. The number of patients experiencing ischemic events (including cerebral ischemia and acute myocardial ischemia), adverse transfusion reactions and requiring life support were comparable in both groups. Additionally, more recently, a systematic Cochrane database review analysed 48 trials and showed that a restrictive blood transfusion strategy led to a 41% reduction in the proportion of individuals subjected to red blood cell transfusions. Authors suggested that there is no evidence of influence of the restrictive strategy on mortality and morbidity (such as stroke and myocardial infarction). Nevertheless, the authors emphasized that in some patient groups, higher hemoglobin levels may be preferable, but there was insufficient evidence to recommend applying a specific strategy to certain patient subgroups (traumatic brain injury, myocardial infarction, etc). Importantly, the authors were of the conviction that hemoglobin levels do not always reliably reflect the need for transfusion in some patients. A further large meta-analysis also demonstrated a reduction in in-hospital mortality among critically ill patients treated with a restrictive transfusion strategy. On the other hand, a liberal blood transfusion strategy improved survival and decreased complications specifically in elderly patients and patients with cardiovascular diseases. This issue is well described by Patel and co-authors, who, in a systematic review and meta-analysis, compared both cardiac and non-cardiac randomized clinical trials, as well as observational studies, investigating restrictive and liberal strategies. The authors demonstrated that the results of randomized studies in cardiac surgery were not in accordance with the a general assumption that a liberal strategy significantly increases mortality and morbidity. Thus available evidence supports the inconsistency of the hemoglobin level as a transfusion trigger, especially in specific cohorts of patients. However, several modern guidelines suggest using the hemoglobin level as the only blood transfusion trigger and in most cases recommend a restrictive strategy.

### Managing cancer-related anaemia with epoetin alfa [^114ZFNcR]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Anaemia occurs in a significant number of patients with cancer, and is associated with symptoms of fatigue, dizziness, headache and decreased health-related quality of life. Clinical trials have demonstrated the ability of epoetin alfa to increase haemoglobin concentrations and reduce transfusion requirements in patients with cancer. Data from three large, open-label, community-based trials of > 7000 patients, as well as a series of smaller, randomized, placebo-controlled studies, have confirmed the efficacy of treatment with epoetin alfa in patients undergoing chemotherapy. In two of the community-based studies (> 2000 patients in each), patients undergoing chemotherapy received epoetin alfa, 150–300 IU/kg or 10,000–20,000 IU, three times weekly. Significant (P < 0.01) increases in haemoglobin concentrations and reductions in transfusion rates were seen in both studies. Significant improvements in quality of life were also reported, as measured by the Linear Analogue Scale Assessment and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anaemia. Importantly, the increases in quality of life were independent of tumour response. These findings were also observed in randomized, placebo-controlled studies. The third study, in approximately 3000 patients, evaluated the efficacy of once-weekly dosing, which significantly (P < 0.01) increased haemoglobin concentrations, reduced transfusion requirements and improved quality of life. Greater increases in haemoglobin concentration were associated with greater improvements in quality-of-life scores. The safety and efficacy profile of the once-weekly regimen was comparable with that of the three times weekly regimen. Maintaining optimal quality of life, while achieving tumour stabilization or regression, is essential to the successful management of patients with cancer. Epoetin alfa has been shown to increase haemoglobin concentration, decrease transfusion requirements and increase quality of life. Given the frequency of adverse sequelae associated with anaemia, its aggressive management should become an integral and routine part of cancer treatment.

### Practice advisory for perioperative visual loss associated with spine surgery 2019: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on perioperative visual loss, the north American neuro-ophthalmology society, and the society for neuroscience in anesthesiology and critical care [^114p7o6q]. Anesthesiology (2019). High credibility.

Advisory recommendations for preoperative patient evaluation and preparation — Review a patient's preoperative history and perform an appropriate examination to identify patients with conditions such as preoperative anemia, vascular risk factors (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, previous stroke, carotid artery stenosis, tobacco use), and obesity. Inform patients that certain preoperative conditions may increase their risk of perioperative visual loss in spine surgery. These include, but are not limited to, those who are male, obese, or have vascular disease risk factors such as hypertension and peripheral vascular disease. Inform patients in whom prolonged procedures, substantial blood loss, or both are anticipated that there may be an increased risk of perioperative visual loss. Determine on a case-by-case basis whether or not to inform patients who are not anticipated to be "high-risk" for visual loss. For the purposes of this Advisory, the Task Force considers such patients (hereafter referred to as "high-risk" patients) to have a higher risk for perioperative visual loss than patients who do not undergo prolonged procedures, have substantial blood loss, or both.

Perioperative blood management — intraoperative and postoperative patient monitoring: Periodically conduct a visual assessment of the surgical field jointly with the surgeon to assess the presence of excessive microvascular or surgical bleeding, and use standard methods for quantitative measurement of blood loss including checking suction canisters, surgical sponges, and surgical drains; monitor for perfusion of vital organs using standard ASA monitors in addition to observing clinical symptoms and physical exam features, and additional monitoring may include echocardiography, renal monitoring, cerebral monitoring, analysis of arterial blood gasses, and mixed venous oxygen saturation; if anemia is suspected, monitor hemoglobin/hematocrit values; if coagulopathy is suspected, obtain standard coagulation tests or viscoelastic assays, if available, as well as platelet count; during and after transfusion, periodically check for signs of a transfusion reaction and, if signs are apparent, immediately stop the transfusion, give supportive therapy, and initiate supportive care, and notify the blood bank of the transfusion reaction case.

An 8-year-old girl suffering from hereditary spherocytosis underwent splenectomy for chronic severe anaemia. Surgery was uneventful and the patient had a good early postoperative recovery. On the third postoperative day, however, she developed severe headache with associated abnormal movements of upper limbs and nystagmus. She had a heart rate of 50bpm and a blood pressure of 180/110mmHg. She was managed with triple antihypertensives, antiepileptics and sedatives. She recovered slowly over 2weeks and is fine at 5months follow-up.

Figure 1
Blood pressure and heart rate registrations pre-, peri- and post-surgery. Fifteen-hour registration, starting at 15 h in the afternoon (T = 0) until 6 h in the morning (T = 15), shows a sustained hypertension (A). Blood pressure and heart rate monitoring during the preperitoneal endoscopic resection of the paraganglioma shows an increase in sympathetic activity at start of intubation that is further augmented when the tumour is manipulated (B). When the tumour was removed, sympathetic activity lowered. The heart rate remained constant throughout the procedure. Postoperative monitoring indicates that there is a remainder of systolic blood pressure variability, which is common after removal of paraganglioma (C).

Upon arrival at the medical outpatient clinic, he complained of dyspnea on exertion that had been stable since he was diagnosed with decompensated heart failure. He also complained of paroxysmal headaches without aberrant palpitations, increased transpiration or paleness. In the context of the persisting anaemia, which was the initial reason for referral, he had not noticed a change in his defecation pattern over the past years and especially no melaena or bloody stool had been present. Further laboratory investigation showed a low mean corpuscular volume and hemoglobin concentration with a low serum iron and ferritin, but a high iron-binding capacity, indicative of hypochromic microcytic anaemia in the context of an iron deficiency (Table 1). The absolute erythrocyte count was within the normal range. In 2010, no cause for his anaemia was found on gastroduodenoscopic and colonoscopic evaluation. A screening CT-scan of the thorax and abdomen with intravenous and rectal contrast was performed to screen for any possible primary malignancy. The abdominal CT-scan showed a round and sharply demarcated tumour of 1.7 by 2.5 cm in close proximity to the bladder wall on the right side of the patient's prostate (Figure 2 A and B). The average post-contrast radiodensity of the tumour measured 90 Hounsfield units, which did not have additional value for the differential diagnosis due to the contrast. No local lymphadenopathy was detected. The findings of the CT-scan were confirmed by digital rectal examination, where an asymmetrically and irregularly enlarged tumour with a hard node was felt and the patient was referred to the urologist for further evaluation under the suspicion of a prostate tumour.

before the full dose is given. When using a "continuous" catheter technique, test doses should be given prior to both the original and all reinforcing doses, because plastic tubing in the epidural space can migrate into a blood vessel or through the duration. When clinical conditions permit, the test dose should contain epinephrine (10 mcg to 15 mcg has been suggested) to serve as a warning of unintended intravascular injection. If injected into a blood vessel, this amount of epinephrine is likely to produce a transient "epinephrine response" within 45 seconds, consisting of an increase in heart rate and/or systolic blood pressure, circumoral pallor, palpitations, and nervousness in the unsedated patient. The sedated patient may exhibit only a pulse rate increase of 20 or more beats per minute for 15 or more seconds. Therefore, following the test dose, the heart rate should be monitored for a heart rate increase. Patients on beta-blockers may not manifest changes in heart rate, but blood pressure monitoring can detect a transient rise in systolic blood pressure. The test dose should also contain 10 mg to 15 mg of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride or an equivalent amount of another local anesthetic to detect an unintended intrathecal administration. This will be evidenced within a few minutes by signs of spinal block (e.g., decreased sensation of the buttocks, paresis of the legs, or, in the sedated patient, absent knee jerk). The Test Dose formulation of Bupivacaine Hydrochloride contains 15 mg of bupivacaine and 15 mcg of epinephrine in a volume of 3 mL. An intravascular or subarachnoid injection is still possible even if results of the test dose are negative. The test dose itself may produce a systemic toxic reaction, high spinal or epinephrine-induced cardiovascular effects. Injection of repeated doses of local anesthetics may cause significant increases in plasma levels with each repeated dose due to slow accumulation of the drug or its metabolites, or to slow metabolic degradation. Tolerance to elevated blood levels varies with the status of the patient. Debilitated, elderly patients and acutely ill patients should be given reduced doses commensurate with their age and physical status. Local anesthetics should also be used with caution in patients with hypotension or heartblock. Careful and constant monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory (adequacy of ventilation) vital signs and the patient's state of consciousness should be performed after each local anesthetic injection. It should be kept in mind at such times that restlessness, anxiety, incoherent speech, lightheadedness, numbness and tingling of the mouth and lips, metallic taste, tinnitus, dizziness, blurred vision, tremors, twitching, depression, or drowsiness may be early warning signs of central nervous system toxicity. Local anesthetic solutions containing a vasoconstrictor should be used cautiously and in carefully restricted quantities in areas of the body supplied by end arteries or having otherwise compromised blood supply such as digits, nose, external ear, or penis. Patients with hypertensive vascular disease may exhibit exaggerated vasoconstrictor response. Ischemic injury or necrosis may result. Because amide-local anesthetics such as Bupivacaine Hydrochloride are metabolized by the liver, these drugs, especially repeat doses, should be used cautiously in patients with hepatic disease. Patients with severe hepatic disease, because of their inability to metabolize local anesthetics normally, are at a greater risk of developing toxic plasma concentrations. Local anesthetics should also be used with caution in patients with impaired cardiovascular function because they may be less able to compensate for functional changes associated with the prolongation of AV conduction produced by these drugs. Serious dose-related cardiac arrhythmias may occur if preparations containing a vasoconstrictor such as epinephrine are employed in patients during or following the administration of potent inhalation anesthetics.

### Treatment for women with postpartum iron deficiency anaemia [^111Lx2HN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Postpartum iron deficiency anaemia is caused by bleeding or inadequate dietary iron intake/uptake. This condition is defined by iron deficiency accompanied by a lower than normal blood haemoglobin concentration, although this can be affected by factors other than anaemia and must be interpreted in the light of any concurrent symptoms. Symptoms include fatigue, breathlessness, and dizziness. Treatment options include oral or intravenous iron, erythropoietin which stimulates red blood cell production, and substitution by red blood cell transfusion.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and harms of the available treatment modalities for women with postpartum iron deficiency anaemia.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (9 April 2015); the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Portal (ICTRP), and the Latin-American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature database (LILACS) (8 April 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

We included published, unpublished and ongoing randomised controlled trials that compared a treatment for postpartum iron deficiency anaemia with placebo, no treatment, or another treatment for postpartum iron deficiency anaemia, including trials described in abstracts only. Cluster-randomised trials were eligible for inclusion. We included both open-label trials and blinded trials, regardless of who was blinded. The participants were women with a postpartum haemoglobin of 120 g per litre (g/L) or less, for which treatment was initiated within six weeks after childbirth. Non-randomised trials, quasi-randomised trials and trials using a cross-over design were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, quality, and extracted data. We contacted study authors and pharmaceutical companies for additional information.

Main Results

We included 22 randomised controlled trials (2858 women), most of which had high risk of bias in several domains. We performed 13 comparisons. Many comparisons are based on a small number of studies with small sample sizes. No analysis of our primary outcomes contained more than two studies. Intravenous iron was compared to oral iron in 10 studies (1553 women). Fatigue was reported in two studies and improved significantly favouring the intravenously treated group in one of the studies. Other anaemia symptoms were not reported. One woman died from cardiomyopathy (risk ratio (RR) 2.95; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 71.96; two studies; one event; 374 women; low quality evidence). One woman developed arrhythmia. Both cardiac complications occurred in the intravenously treated group. Allergic reactions occurred in three women treated with intravenous iron, not statistically significant (average RR 2.78; 95% CI 0.31 to 24.92; eight studies; 1454 women; I² = 0%; low quality evidence). Gastrointestinal events were less frequent in the intravenously treated group (average RR 0.31; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.47; eight studies; 169 events; 1307 women; I² = 0%; very low quality evidence). One study evaluated red blood cell transfusion versus non-intervention. General fatigue improved significantly more in the transfusion group at three days (MD -0.80; 95% CI -1.53 to -0.07; women 388; low quality evidence), but no difference between groups was seen at six weeks. Maternal mortality was not reported. The remaining comparisons evaluated oral iron (with or without other food substances) versus placebo (three studies), intravenous iron with oral iron versus oral iron (two studies) and erythropoietin (alone or combined with iron) versus placebo or iron (seven studies). These studies did not investigate fatigue. Maternal mortality was rarely reported.

Authors' Conclusions

The body of evidence did not allow us to reach a clear conclusion regarding the efficacy of the interventions on postpartum iron deficiency anaemia. The quality of evidence was low. Clinical outcomes were rarely reported. Laboratory values may not be reliable indicators for efficacy, as they do not always correlate with clinical treatment effects. It remains unclear which treatment modality is most effective in alleviating symptoms of postpartum anaemia. Intravenous iron was superior regarding gastrointestinal harms, however anaphylaxis and cardiac events occurred and more data are needed to establish whether this was caused by intravenous iron. The clinical significance of some temporarily improved fatigue scores in women treated with blood transfusion is uncertain and this modest effect should be balanced against known risks, e.g. maternal mortality (not reported) and maternal immunological sensitisation, which can potentially harm future pregnancies. When comparing oral iron to placebo it remains unknown whether efficacy (relief of anaemia symptoms) outweighs the documented gastrointestinal harms. We could not draw conclusions regarding erythropoietin treatment due to lack of evidence. Further research should evaluate treatment effect through clinical outcomes, i.e. presence and severity of anaemia symptoms balanced against harms, i.e. survival and severe morbidity.

### Preoperative hemoglobin [^111MabYH]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, for hip fracture patients over 80 years, a preoperative hemoglobin level of < 10 g/DL was associated with an increase in postoperative MACEs, in-hospital mortality, and transfusion > 2 U rate. Furthermore, we obtained the same results even after multivariable adjustment and subgroup analysis for hip fracture patients over 80 years. It is indicated that increasing the preoperative hemoglobin above 10 g/DL might lower the postoperative MACEs, in-hospital mortality and perioperative transfusion > 2U.

### Recommendations from the international consensus conference on anemia management in surgical patients (ICCAMS) [^1171wSFX]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Consensus Statements: Diagnosis

All patients with anemia should be evaluated for the cause of anemia — wherever possible, early enough preoperatively to enable sufficient time for treatment to be successful.
It is important to identify iron deficiency, including in patients with anemia of inflammation (or anemia of chronic disease).
Patients with IDA should be evaluated for the cause of the iron deficiency, whereas patients with anemia and normal iron studies should be evaluated for coexisting causes of anemia (ie, renal disease, primary hematologic disease, and nutrition deficiency).
Evaluation for iron deficiency should include iron studies (serum iron, total iron binding capacity, transferrin saturation (TSAT), serum ferritin); if available, reticulocyte Hb content and/or serum hepcidin should be considered in inflammatory states.
The most important criteria for defining absolute iron deficiency were ferritin < 30 ng/mL and/or TSAT < 20%; ferritin < 100 ng/mL may define iron deficiency in inflammatory states. If available, either a reticulocyte Hb < 29 pg or a serum hepcidin level < 20 µg/L also suggest the presence of iron deficiency in inflammatory states.

Supporting Evidence: Diagnosis

In a study of 3342 patients undergoing major elective surgery, the overall prevalence of anemia was 36%. Of the patients with anemia, 62% had absolute iron deficiency and another 5% had low iron stores. Therefore, all patients with anemia should be screened for iron deficiency. In some circumstances (eg, planned surgery associated with large blood loss), it may also be appropriate to evaluate nonanemic surgical patients for iron deficiency. Patients with anemia who are not iron deficient should be evaluated for other causes of anemia (eg, renal disease, primary hematologic disease, nutritional deficiencies). Determination of whether anemia is microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic (in patients with reticulocyte production index < 2) may help identify likely causes. Wherever possible, evaluations should be performed early enough preoperatively to enable sufficient time for treatment to be successful. In patients undergoing urgent/emergency procedures, blood samples for evaluation and classification of anemia should be drawn preoperatively, with the aim of testing promptly (preoperatively if possible).

Preprocedure preparation — blood management protocols and red blood cell (RBC) transfusion thresholds: Multimodal protocols or algorithms may be employed as strategies to reduce the usage of blood products, but no single algorithm or protocol can be recommended at this time; a restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy may be safely used to reduce transfusion administration; the determination of whether hemoglobin concentrations between 6 and 10 g/dl justify or require RBC transfusion should be based on bleeding, intravascular volume status, signs of organ ischemia, and cardiopulmonary reserve; red blood cells should be administered unit-by-unit, when possible, with interval reevaluation.

### Anaesthesia in a patient with subarachanoidal haemorrhage and high oxygen affinity haemoglobinopathy (HB york): case report [^117KcT5R]. BMC Anesthesiology (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This case report describes a high urgency neurosurgical intervention in a patient with HbY. There was no time for taking special preoperative precautions, as described by Larson et al. as our patient experienced sudden and rapid blood loss. The first Hb value was 10.8 g/dl. The guidelines of the German Medical Association recommend that attempts should be made to maintain intraoperative Hb concentrations above 10 g/dl in case of acute bleeding. Taking into account the fact that approximately half of the patient's haemoglobin was non-functional, a more accurate estimate of the "functional" or "actual" Hb level would have been about 5.4 g/dl. Fortunately, the reaction to the sudden blood loss was not dramatic. There was neither clinical nor laboratory evidence of ischemia. Our patient was generously transfused, achieving a haemoglobin concentration of 16.8 g/dl by the end of surgery. However, it appears rather difficult to assess how much haemoglobin was functional when a blood loss of 1600 mL (containing approximately 800 mL HbY) was substituted with 1200 mL "healthy" PRBC with a haematocrit of 60%. When performing such a rough or 'ballpark' estimate, the use of the following calculation is proposed: Starting with a Hb of 17.5 g/dl, a blood loss of approximately 40% to 10.8 g/dl was nearly compensated with PRBC to Hb 16.8 g/dl. The lost blood contained HbY and "healthy" blood in an equal ratio, thus 20% of lost blood was "pure" HbY. This was substituted with 100% healthy blood, leading to a shift in the HbY:"healthy" blood ratio of 30:70 (50%-20%/50% + 20%) and an estimated value of a functional haemoglobin concentration of 11.8 g/dl (70% of 16.8 g/dl). However, a storage-related depletion of 2.3-diphosphoglycerate (2.3-DPG) content in erythrocytes causing an additional leftward shift of the oxygen-dissociation curve could decrease oxygen transport capacity.

### Red blood cell transfusion in critically ill adults: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^115o2hfK]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

The hemoglobin thresholds prompting RBC transfusion varied across studies, with a restrictive threshold generally defined as a hemoglobin level of 7 to 8 g/dL and a permissive threshold typically ranging from a hemoglobin level of 8.5 to 10 g/dL (Table 1). Hemodynamic instability typically has been defined as hypotension (mean arterial pressure, < 65 mm Hg, or systolic BP, < 100 mm Hg), tissue hypoperfusion caused by acute bleeding, or both.

Question 1: Should critically ill patients be treated with a restrictive or permissive RBC transfusion strategy?

1. In critically ill patients, we recommend a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy over a permissive RBC transfusion strategy (Strong Recommendation, Moderate Certainty of Evidence).

Postoperative blood transfusion — open surgical repair (OSR) and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR): A threshold for blood transfusion after OSR or EVAR has not been established, and in a statewide database transfusion after major vascular procedures occurred in 25% of patients at a median hemoglobin level of 7.7 g/dL. A hemoglobin concentration of < 7 g/dL has been recommended as a transfusion threshold in other high-risk settings, whereas "blood transfusion for a hemoglobin concentration of < 10 g/dL has been a common practice", but a meta-analysis comparing thresholds of 7 to 8 g/dL and 9 to 10 g/dL did not discern outcome differences. The text states that, in the absence of ongoing blood loss, transfusion during or after OSR or EVAR is recommended only if the hemoglobin concentration is at or below 7 g/dL, and the formal graded guidance is: "In the absence of ongoing blood loss, we suggest a threshold for blood transfusion during or after aneurysm repair at a hemoglobin concentration of 7 g/dL or below" (Level of recommendation 2 [Weak]; Quality of evidence C [Low]).

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^116BGimw]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Despite numerous guidelines on the management of anaemia in surgical patients, there is no pragmatic guidance for the diagnosis and management of anaemia and iron deficiency in the postoperative period. A number of experienced researchers and clinicians took part in a two-day expert workshop and developed the following consensus statement. After presentation of our own research data and local policies and procedures, appropriate relevant literature was reviewed and discussed. We developed a series of best-practice and evidence-based statements to advise on patient care with respect to anaemia and iron deficiency in the postoperative period. These statements include: a diagnostic approach to iron deficiency and anaemia in surgical patients; identification of patients appropriate for treatment; and advice on practical management and follow-up that is easy to implement. Available data allow the fulfilment of the requirements of Pillar 1 of Patient Blood Management. We urge national and international research funding bodies to take note of these recommendations, particularly in terms of funding large-scale prospective, randomised clinical trials that can most effectively address the important clinical questions and this clearly unmet medical need.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for sickle cell disease: prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cerebrovascular disease in children and adults [^11337Lar]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease — postapheresis targets and thresholds for exchange transfusion emphasize HbS percentage and hemoglobin limits to optimize oxygen delivery while avoiding viscosity-related complications. Evidence suggests that oxygen delivery to the brain in SCD is dependent not only on the total hemoglobin concentration, but also on the percentage of HbS, and the goal of red blood cell exchange with apheresis is to lower HbS while preventing an excessive rise in hemoglobin. Thresholds for postapheresis HbS percentage and hemoglobin level are typically set at 15% to 20% and 10 g/dL, respectively, and the HbS level of 15% to 20% allows a threshold of < 30% HbS to persist for ~4 weeks. When the HbS level is < 20%, the total hemoglobin level can generally be > 10 g/dL, up to ~12 to 13 g/dL, without concern for viscosity-related complications. When the hemoglobin level is < 5.0 g/dL, a simple transfusion to increase the total hemoglobin to ~10.0 g/dL may be required, and generally, red blood cell exchange with apheresis is not recommended for patients with SCD and hemoglobin levels < 5.0 g/dL.

### Preoperative hemoglobin [^117VkFYQ]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

Compared to other factors, such as old age, anemia is a modifiable preoperative condition. There is a lack of a universal preoperative hemoglobin threshold for frail elderly patients over 80 years receiving hip fracture surgery. Transfusion guidelines 2011 recommended preoperative hemoglobin levels of 9 g/DL or 10 g/DL for patients with a history of ischemic heart disease as the transfusion threshold and suggested a higher blood transfusion trigger for older patients. In Denmark, a hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/DL is recommended as the RBC transfusion threshold. Guidelines for the management of hip fractures 2021 recommended that the recognition and management of blood should precede according to an agreed-upon hospital protocol.

What is the optimal preoperative hemoglobin level for hip fracture patients over 80 years? The recommendations from the 2018 Frankfurt consensus conference suggested 8 g/DL in patients with hip fracture and cardiovascular disease or other risk factors. However, although data from 17 607 literature citations and 145 studies, including 63 RCTs with 23 143 patients and 82 observational studies with more than 4 million patients, were analyzed, this was a conditional recommendation, and only 10 studies analyzed hip fracture patients. Furthermore, none of the studies focused on patients over 80 years old. Neef and colleaguespointed out the current situation and concluded that preoperative anemia management has not yet been established, but the results of the studies confirmed the positive effect of preoperative anemia diagnosis and treatment. However, for the special group of hip surgery patients over 80 years, the workflows of inspection and correction of preoperative anemia were established in our center. The guidelines in 2018 suggested that the hemoglobin trigger could be lower than 10 g/DL, but the evidence for frail hip fracture patients over 80 years old was insufficient. Although blood management in cardiac surgery favors the restrictive transfusion strategy compared to the liberal transfusion strategy. – trials and reviews focused on hip fracture patients hold a different view. A context-specific systematic review and meta-analysis reported that restricted transfusion strategies should be applied with caution in high-risk patients undergoing major surgery and this may be detrimental. It was a systematic review in perioperative and acute care settings according to patient characteristics and clinical settings and was closer to real-world research. A meta-analysis by Gu and colleaguesreviewed ten studies and found that restrictive transfusion (mostly a hemoglobin level of 8 g/DL or symptomatic anemia) increases the risk of cardiovascular events compared to liberal (mostly a hemoglobin level of 10 g/DL) transfusion (RR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.16, 1.98; p = 0.003) in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. The TRIFE randomized controlled trial enrolled 284 hip fracture patients over 65 years of age and concluded that for frail elderly hip fracture patients, recovery from a physical disabilities transfusion strategy (threshold 9.7 g/DL) was similar to a liberal strategy (< 11.3 g/DL). Our retrospective study explored the optimal preoperative hemoglobin level for elderly hip fracture patients over 80 years of age and concluded that a preoperative hemoglobin level > 10 g/DL might be associated with lower postoperative morbidity and mortality, which supported the results of the Gu and TRIFE studies.

Regarding perioperative care for perioperative bleeding, more specifically with respect to management of preoperative anemia, assessment and timing of surgery, BSH 2024 guidelines recommend to consider referring patients with unexplained anemia without iron deficiency according to the severity of anaemia (hemoglobin < 120 g/L for males, hemoglobin < 100 g/L for females, or according to locally agreed criteria), recognizing that the risk of a serious cause or haemoglobinopathy is proportional to anemia severity.

How to treat OH in PD?

OH in PD should be treated with a stepwise approach. First, exacerbating factors such as concomitant infections, anemia, dehydration, and the combination of multiple drugs with BP lowering effect should be excluded or treated.

In a second step, non-pharmacological therapeutic measures should be considered. Rapid drinking of cold water has a significant, though transient, pressor effect lasting about 1 h. Studies showed that salt supplements had no additive effect with respect to increased water intake, but no dietary salt restriction should be recommended either. Large meals can produce significant falls in BP (e.g. post-prandial hypotension), and it is therefore advisable to divide the daily caloric intake into several smaller meals. Sleeping in a 10°–20° head up tilted position can also improve orthostatic tolerance the day after. A steeper head-up tilt sleeping position is likely more effective and can be pursued, if well tolerated. Physical counterpressure maneuvers (squatting or crossing the legs and tensing the leg, buttock, abdominal and arm muscles) can be recommended to stabilize the BP in case of dizziness. Wearing an elastic abdominal binder is an additional non-pharmacological option to increase orthostatic BP levels, and more effective than compression stockings.

### Clinical practice guidelines from the AABB: red blood cell transfusion thresholds and storage [^113nUZwa]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

More than 100 million units of blood are collected worldwide each year, yet the indication for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion and the optimal length of RBC storage prior to transfusion are uncertain.

Objective

To provide recommendations for the target hemoglobin level for RBC transfusion among hospitalized adult patients who are hemodynamically stable and the length of time RBCs should be stored prior to transfusion.

Evidence Review

Reference librarians conducted a literature search for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating hemoglobin thresholds for RBC transfusion (1950-May 2016) and RBC storage duration (1948-May 2016) without language restrictions. The results were summarized using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation method. For RBC transfusion thresholds, 31 RCTs included 12 587 participants and compared restrictive thresholds (transfusion not indicated until the hemoglobin level is 7–8 g/dL) with liberal thresholds (transfusion not indicated until the hemoglobin level is 9–10 g/dL). The summary estimates across trials demonstrated that restrictive RBC transfusion thresholds were not associated with higher rates of adverse clinical outcomes, including 30-day mortality, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, rebleeding, pneumonia, or thromboembolism. For RBC storage duration, 13 RCTs included 5515 participants randomly allocated to receive fresher blood or standard-issue blood. These RCTs demonstrated that fresher blood did not improve clinical outcomes.

Findings

It is good practice to consider the hemoglobin level, the overall clinical context, patient preferences, and alternative therapies when making transfusion decisions regarding an individual patient. Recommendation 1: a restrictive RBC transfusion threshold in which the transfusion is not indicated until the hemoglobin level is 7 g/dL is recommended for hospitalized adult patients who are hemodynamically stable, including critically ill patients, rather than when the hemoglobin level is 10 g/dL (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). A restrictive RBC transfusion threshold of 8 g/dL is recommended for patients undergoing orthopedic surgery, cardiac surgery, and those with preexisting cardiovascular disease (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). The restrictive transfusion threshold of 7 g/dL is likely comparable with 8 g/dL, but RCT evidence is not available for all patient categories. These recommendations do not apply to patients with acute coronary syndrome, severe thrombocytopenia (patients treated for hematological or oncological reasons who are at risk of bleeding), and chronic transfusion-dependent anemia (not recommended due to insufficient evidence). Recommendation 2: patients, including neonates, should receive RBC units selected at any point within their licensed dating period (standard issue) rather than limiting patients to transfusion of only fresh (storage length: < 10 days) RBC units (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence).

Conclusions and Relevance

Research in RBC transfusion medicine has significantly advanced the science in recent years and provides high-quality evidence to inform guidelines. A restrictive transfusion threshold is safe in most clinical settings and the current blood banking practices of using standard-issue blood should be continued.

### Recommendations from the international consensus conference on anemia management in surgical patients (ICCAMS) [^115CqYGV]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Overall, there is strong evidence of correlations between anemia and a range of clinical outcomes. However, the panel acknowledged that anemia is not a confirmed cause of these outcomes; it is possible that anemia is a marker of other underlying morbidities that impair outcomes.

The importance of educating patients preoperatively about anemia and its correlation with postsurgical outcomes was recognized by the panel. Improved education is associated with increased adherence to treatment for anemia and may encourage dietary improvements, potentially leading to higher Hb levels at the time of surgery.–

The results of clinical studies investigating outcomes associated with preoperative anemia in specific types of surgery are presented in the Supplemental Digital Content (Parts 1, Supplemental Digital Content 3, and 4, Supplemental Digital Content 2).

Perioperative and postoperative anemia: Blood loss is an important cause of perioperative anemia, and surgical bleeding increases the risks of morbidity and mortality because of the need for RBC transfusion and the occurrence of hemorrhagic shock or ischemia.–In addition, if perioperative anemia remains undiagnosed and untreated, the patient may be placed at risk of negative outcomes including those described below for postoperative anemia.

Postoperative anemia has been associated with worsened clinical outcomes. A recent study of patients with colorectal cancer reported that postoperative anemia was associated with increased RBC transfusion, longer length of hospital stay, impaired quality of life scores, and lower overall survival at 5 years. In a retrospective analysis of 300 surgical patients who had declined RBC transfusions, the odds of death increased by a factor of 2.5 for each 1 g/dL decrease in postoperative Hb below 8 g/dL. A study of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) patients showed that decreased postoperative Hb levels were associated with increased all-cause mortality. Postoperative anemia was also associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular events. In orthopedic surgery, hospital stay has been shown to be prolonged when the severity of postoperative anemia is increased. As with preoperative anemia, the panel acknowledged that postoperative anemia is not a confirmed cause of worsened clinical outcomes and that it could instead be a marker of other underlying morbidities.

Screening and Diagnosis

Consensus Statements: Screening

The prevalence of preoperative anemia and its association with worse clinical outcomes justify screening all patients for anemia before surgery, except those undergoing minor procedures.
Screening for preoperative anemia should not be restricted to patients undergoing elective surgery.
It is never too late to start anemia evaluation in patients undergoing elective or urgent surgery.

### The efficacy and safety of vitamin C for iron supplementation in adult patients with iron deficiency anemia: a randomized clinical trial [^114Jezfm]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Study Population

We screened patients newly diagnosed with IDA who had not received any iron supplement therapy in Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, from January 1, 2016, to December 30, 2017. Some of these patients were found to have anemia during a routine checkup. Most patients presented because of symptoms such as dizziness and palpitation. The nurse prechecked first. If the patients were found to have anemia, the nurse would recommend them to the anemia clinic to receive examination and treatment. Then our team screened these patients for enrollment.

The inclusion criteria were age 18 years or older, voluntarily signing the informed consent form, and meeting the diagnostic criteria for IDA, which include a hemoglobin level less than 13 g/dL for men or less than 12 g/dL for women (to convert hemoglobin to grams per liter, multiply by 10.0), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) less than 80 μm 3 (to convert MCV to femtoliters, multiply by 1.0), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) less than 27 pg/cell, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) less than 32 g/dL (to convert MCHC to grams per liter, multiply by 10), serum ferritin level less than 14 ng/mL for women or 30 ng/mL for men, serum iron less than 39 μg/dL for women or 56 μg/dL for men, transferring saturation less than 20%, and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) exceeding 428 μg/dL (to convert TIBC to micromoles per liter, multiply by 0.179). Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, severe uncorrectable bleeding, identified stomachache or intestinal ulcers, any inflammatory diseases, or identified gastrointestinal tumors.

Study Monitor

Patients were treated for 3 months and assessed with a complete blood count every 2 weeks for 2 months; iron metabolism was measured at week 8. The primary outcome was the change in hemoglobin level from baseline to the 2-week follow-up. The secondary outcomes included the change in the reticulocyte percentage after 2 weeks of treatment, the increase in hemoglobin after 4 weeks of treatment, the increase in serum ferritin after 8 weeks of treatment, and adverse events. Exploratory outcomes included MCV, MCH, and MCHC levels every 2 weeks at all time points and serum iron level, transferring saturation, and TIBC at 8 weeks. The Department of Laboratory Medicine in Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, conducted the measurements and biochemical analyses.

Regarding perioperative care for perioperative bleeding, more specifically with respect to management of postoperative anemia (iron supplements and EPO-stimulating agents), ESAIC 2023 guidelines recommend to consider testing for iron deficiency with subsequent administration of IV iron at weight-based dosing in patients with postoperative anemia with hemoglobin at least 10 g/dL if ferritin is < 100 mcg/L or ferritin is < 300 mcg/L and transferrin saturation is < 20%.

Patient evaluation — recommendations specify to review previous records and interview the patient or family to identify prior transfusion history, drug-induced or congenital coagulopathy, thrombotic events, and organ ischemia risks; to review hemoglobin, hematocrit, and coagulation profiles; to order additional tests based on the medical condition; to perform a focused physical examination for bleeding signs; and to conduct the preoperative evaluation sufficiently in advance (e.g., several days to weeks) to allow preparation.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing intraoperative red blood cell transfusion strategies [^112AWwD8]. Annals of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Similarly, The Frankfurt Consensus Committeerecommends a transfusion trigger of 8 g/dL in patients "with a hip fracture and cardiovascular disease", stating that they found no increase in critical outcomes including 30-day mortality and various morbidity outcomes. It is unclear whether this recommendation is meant to encompass the intraoperative period, as the evidence base supporting this recommendation is drawn largely from the postoperative period.

The Perioperative Blood Management Guidelines published by the American Society of Anesthesiology Task Forcesuggest that restrictive transfusion strategies lead to fewer blood transfusions, with equivocal findings regarding mortality and perioperative complications. They state that "the determination of whether hemoglobin concentration between 6 and 10 g/dL justify or require RBC transfusion should be based on potential or actual ongoing bleeding, intravascular volume status, signs of organ ischemia, and adequacy of cardiopulmonary reserve". Similarly, guidelines from the European Society of Anesthesiologyrecommend a target hemoglobin concentration of 7–9 g/dL during active bleeding. They recommended the implementation of restrictive transfusion strategies to reduce exposure to blood products. Again, much of the evidence base supporting these recommendations is derived from the critical care literature and is not necessarily transferable to the operative setting.

The results of the current study lend support to these guidelines, but further caution against the widespread use of restrictive triggers during surgery owing to the limited number of trials conducted in the intraoperative period.

Strengths of this systematic review include its comprehensive nature and search strategy. It tackles a highly focused and important clinical question that affects millions of patients every year, and it seeks to fill a major knowledge gap in the literature that no other systematic review has directly addressed.

This study was limited by the heterogeneity of the patients populations, study interventions, and outcome reporting between trials. Although this was mitigated to some degree by using random-effects models for meta-analysis, the variability in baseline patient populations and study interventions introduced significant heterogeneity in several meta-analyses that persisted despite subgroup analysis. For example, potential for blood loss is very different among patients undergoing different operative interventions. This was illustrated when exploring heterogeneity in the intraoperative transfusion meta-analysis, whereby excluding a study done in patients undergoing skin grafting for major burns significantly decreased statistical heterogeneity. Outcome selection was also heterogeneous between studies. In particular, definitions of postoperative adverse events were highly variable, at times precluding meaningful meta-analysis.

Regarding perioperative care for perioperative bleeding, more specifically with respect to management of preoperative anemia (thresholds), BSH 2024 guidelines recommend to view hemoglobin levels < 130 g/L as the threshold at which patients are likely to benefit from screening for iron and/or other nutrient deficiencies and enhanced patient blood management measures.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^115iHRx7]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Summary

Despite numerous guidelines on the management of anaemia in surgical patients, there is no pragmatic guidance for the diagnosis and management of anaemia and iron deficiency in the postoperative period. A number of experienced researchers and clinicians took part in a two‐day expert workshop and developed the following consensus statement. After presentation of our own research data and local policies and procedures, appropriate relevant literature was reviewed and discussed. We developed a series of best‐practice and evidence‐based statements to advise on patient care with respect to anaemia and iron deficiency in the postoperative period. These statements include: a diagnostic approach to iron deficiency and anaemia in surgical patients; identification of patients appropriate for treatment; and advice on practical management and follow‐up that is easy to implement. Available data allow the fulfilment of the requirements of Pillar 1 of Patient Blood Management. We urge national and international research funding bodies to take note of these recommendations, particularly in terms of funding large‐scale prospective, randomised clinical trials that can most effectively address the important clinical questions and this clearly unmet medical need.

### Restrictive and liberal red cell transfusion strategies in adult patients: reconciling clinical data with best practice [^116E1Aad]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Future direction

At an academic level, a multidisciplinary think-tank from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened and agreed to the need for three adult trials evaluating RBC transfusion trigger strategies to improve overall outcome and to validate the following hypotheses: first, higher Hb levels resulting from a liberal transfusion strategy during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery will lead to lower incidence of 30-day all-cause mortality, recurrent myocardial infarction, infection, and other complications as compared with a restrictive transfusion threshold; second, in patients with acute coronary syndrome or coronary artery disease undergoing cardiac catheterization, a liberal transfusion strategy will be associated with a lower incidence of composite outcome of all-cause mortality at 30 days, recurrent myocardial infarction, emergent percutaneous intervention (angioplasty or stent insertion), or coronary artery bypass graft surgery within 30 days of enrollment when compared with a restrictive transfusion strategy; and third, in hemodynamically stable patients in the ICU with a history of ischemic heart disease, multiple organ dysfunction scores will be improved by maintaining Hb > 10 g/dl. That the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute would propose such studies suggests that the ideal Hb transfusion trigger has yet to be determined for some common clinical conditions, and Hb levels > 8 g/dl in some stable patients may be warranted.

At the level of the practicing physician, what are clinicians to do? Fundamentally, physicians should intelligently apply their skill set to their patients' needs, incorporating all physiological data at their disposal, and incorporate – as applicable – the scientific support from Practice Guidelines. Recent survey data demonstrating the lack of a substantial reduction in ICU RBC transfusion in one state has been interpreted to suggest that restrictive RBC transfusion thresholds may not have 'fully translated into practice in different hospital settings'. Perhaps in assessing this lack of conformity the authors of such uncontrolled, hospital-derived datasets should in part acknowledge that experienced clinical decision-making may have presided over the selection for or against transfusion. After all, the primary methodology for evaluating the restrictive transfusion hypothesis in the TRICC and FOCUS trials has been itself criticized for lack of inclusion of a usual practice arm in the dichotomized trial protocols, thus encouraging practice misalignments and hence more limited data interpretability. As an optimal use of a practice guideline, trial data supportive of a restrictive transfusion strategy provide clinicians with a helpful metaphorical arm rest, to pause and carefully consider whether a transfusion is likely to be helpful, which in many cases it will not.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for transfusion strategies in critical care, more specifically with respect to non-massive bleeding, RBC transfusion, ESICM 2021 guidelines recommend to consider administering restrictive transfusion, guided by presence of shock and symptoms potentially attributable to anemia (such as dyspnea, syncope, tachycardia, angina, neurological symptoms) or hemoglobin < 6 g/dL, rather than at a liberal target hemoglobin of 9 g/dL in patients with non-massive postpartum hemorrhage.

Transfusion reaction monitoring and response — during and after transfusion — advise: During and after transfusion, periodically check for signs of a transfusion reaction including hyperthermia, hemoglobinuria, microvascular bleeding, hypoxemia, respiratory distress, increased peak airway pressure, urticaria, hypotension and signs of hypocalcemia. If signs of a transfusion reaction are apparent, immediately stop the transfusion, give supportive therapy, and initiate supportive care, and notify the blood bank of the transfusion reaction case.

Perioperative blood transfusion management — restrictive versus liberal transfusion strategies: Randomized trials have compared a "restrictive transfusion strategy, in which patients with a hemoglobin level < 7 or 8 g/dL are transfused", with a "liberal" strategy that "uses 9 g/dL as a transfusion threshold", and a meta-analysis of "37 randomized controlled trials with > 19 000 patients" found "the risk of stroke, MI, congestive heart failure, renal failure, and 30-day mortality was not significantly different between restrictive and liberal transfusion strategies". The meta-analysis was limited by too few patients with brain injury, acute coronary syndromes, or congestive heart failure to guide recommendations for these very high-risk groups.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^117Qc7x1]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Similarly, compared with oral iron, the use of i.v. iron for treating postpartum anaemia has been shown to result in greater and faster haemoglobin increases, improved replenishment of iron stores, a lower incidence of adverse side‐effects and greater improvement in quality of life 15, 46.

Therefore, should postoperative iron therapy be indicated, i.v. formulations are recommended. This is in line with recent management guidelines in surgical patients experiencing severe bleeding (GRADE 2C for i.v. iron preparations postoperatively) 7. When calculating the total iron dose, it is important to take into account the pre‐operative haemoglobin level and iron status, the magnitude of postoperative haemoglobin drop and whether patients have received postoperative red cell transfusion (Fig. 1). The use of i.v. iron formulations which allow rapid (15–60 min) infusion of high doses of iron (1000 mg or more) offers added convenience to both physicians and patients and should be preferred, despite their higher cost (Table 1) 40, 64.

(d) Postoperative ferritin < 100 μg.l −1, ferritin < 300 μg.l −1 and transferrin saturation < 20% or reticulocyte haemoglobin content < 28 pg. (e) Due to pre‐operative anaemia or heavy surgical bleeding, irrespective of iron status. (f) Total iron deficiency = (target haemoglobin − actual haemoglobin) × weight (kg) × 0.24. Add another 10 mg.kg −1 for replenishing iron stores, especially in patients with pre‐operative iron deficiency. Consider adding recombinant human erythropoietin (40,000 IU) for patients with severe anaemia or declining transfusion. For i.v. iron dosing schedule, see Table 1. (i) Transfuse one red blood cell unit at the time, with post‐transfusion re‐assessment of further needs. Consider i.v. iron supplementation after transfusion, using post‐transfusion haemoglobin as actual haemoglobin for total iron deficiency calculation.

### Practice advisory for perioperative visual loss associated with spine surgery 2019: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on perioperative visual loss, the north American neuro-ophthalmology society, and the society for neuroscience in anesthesiology and critical care [^1164Matd]. Anesthesiology (2019). High credibility.

Perioperative visual loss (POVL) in spine surgery — expert consultant survey results indicate agreement patterns across recommendations. Continually monitor systemic blood pressure in high-risk patients (Strongly Agree (%) 82*, Agree (%) 9, Equivocal (%) 9, Disagree (%) 0, Strongly Disagree (%) 0) and treat prolonged significant decreases in blood pressure (Strongly Agree (%) 91*, Agree (%) 9, Equivocal (%) 0, Disagree (%) 0, Strongly Disagree (%) 0). For deliberate hypotension, determine on a case-by-case basis whether it should be used in high-risk patients (Strongly Agree (%) 44, Agree (%) 15*, Equivocal (%) 3, Disagree (%) 3, Strongly Disagree (%) 35), and use it only when the anesthesiologist and surgeon agree that its use is essential despite employing other methods to minimize bleeding (Strongly Agree (%) 37, Agree (%) 34*, Equivocal (%) 6, Disagree (%) 6, Strongly Disagree (%) 17). Avoid direct pressure on the eye to prevent RAO (Strongly Agree (%) 88*, Agree (%) 12, Equivocal (%) 0, Disagree (%) 0, Strongly Disagree (%) 0) and check the position of the eyes periodically during surgery to ensure the head has not moved and there is no eye compression (Strongly Agree (%) 91*, Agree (%) 9, Equivocal (%) 0, Disagree (%) 0, Strongly Disagree (%) 0). Position the high-risk patient so that the head is level with or higher than the heart when possible (Strongly Agree (%) 49*, Agree (%) 34, Equivocal (%) 9, Disagree (%) 9, Strongly Disagree (%) 0). If there is concern regarding potential visual loss, obtain an urgent ophthalmologic consultation to determine its cause (Strongly Agree (%) 82*, Agree (%) 18, Equivocal (%) 0, Disagree (%) 0, Strongly Disagree (%) 0); CT or MRI may be used on a case-by-case basis to rule out intracranial causes of visual loss as well as to visualize an abnormal optic nerve (Strongly Agree (%) 50*, Agree (%) 32, Equivocal (%) 18, Disagree (%) 0, Strongly Disagree (%) 0). The survey had a Response Rate = 51% and includes preoperative counseling to inform patients when prolonged procedures, substantial blood loss, or both are anticipated that there may be an increased risk of POVL (Strongly Agree (%) 69*, Agree (%) 20, Equivocal (%) 11, Disagree (%) 0, Strongly Disagree (%) 0).

### Practical anemia bundle and hemoglobin recovery in critical illness… [^112kSygn]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Hemoglobin concentration at 1 month after discharge was greater in patients receiving the intervention vs standard care. A linear combination of treatment and time point by treatment interaction term estimated the treatment effect at the 1-month follow-up. Median postrandomization hospital LOS was 5 days in the intervention group and 6 days in the standard care group. One patient died during index hospitalization in the intervention group vs 0 in the standard care group. Hemoglobin concentration at 1 month after hospital discharge was significantly greater in the intervention group compared with the standard care group.

These findings build on previous work evaluating the effects of IV iron after surgery and during critical illness. Several small trials in various postsurgical populations have shown that IV iron effectively augments hemoglobin recovery, 28–30 although with limited assessments of clinical outcomes and without incorporation of anemia prevention strategies. IV iron administration at ICU discharge vs usual care found greater hemoglobin recovery up to 3 months after randomization. 31 These results are consistent with findings in the present trial and those of a recent meta-analysis showing improved hemoglobin recovery through at least 30 days after discharge among critically ill patients who received IV iron during inpatient admission. 32 Hemoglobin recovery in response to iron replacement is not instantaneous, with this trial's findings highlighting that most recovery will occur after index hospitalization.

This notion is supported by numerically lower transfusion rates in the intervention vs standard care group through the first 3 months after hospitalization, which accompanied improved posthospitalization hemoglobin recovery.

### Don't proceed with elective surgery in patients… [^112hgUX4]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Scheduled maintenance is planned for September 13–14. You may experience brief interruptions during this time. Anemia is common, presenting in approximately one-third of patients undergoing elective surgery. There is often the misconception that anemia is harmless, when, in fact, it is independently associated with significant morbidity and mortality that can be as high as 30–40% in certain patient populations. Treatment of anemia improves patient readiness for surgery, aids in management of comorbid conditions, decreases length of stay and readmission rates, and reduces transfusion risks. Treatment modalities may include nutritional supplementations, such as iron, B12 and folate, changes in medication, management of chronic inflammatory conditions or previously undiagnosed malignancy, or other interventions based on the etiology.

### Preoperative hematocrit levels and postoperative outcomes in older patients undergoing noncardiac surgery… [^117LboG9]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

Thirty-day mortality and cardiac event rates increased monotonically, with either positive or negative deviations from normal hematocrit levels. We found a 1. 6% increase in 30-day postoperative mortality associated with every percentage-point increase or decrease in the hematocrit value from the normal range. Additional analyses suggest that the adjusted risk of 30-day postoperative mortality and cardiac morbidity begins to rise when hematocrit levels decrease to less than 39% or exceed 51%. Conclusions Even mild degrees of preoperative anemia or polycythemia were associated with an increased risk of 30-day postoperative mortality and cardiac events in older, mostly male veterans undergoing major noncardiac surgery. Future studies should determine whether these findings are reproducible in other populations and if preoperative management of anemia or polycythemia decreases the risk of postoperative mortality.

They also tended to have ascites, dyspnea, COPD, bleeding disorders, high serum sodium values, low platelet counts, high white blood cell counts, and high serum aminotransferase values. After adjusting for potential confounding, each hematocrit category in the anemic and polycythemic ranges had significantly worse outcomes for 30-day mortality and the composite of mortality and cardiac events, except for the hematocrit category of 21. 0% to
23. 9%. The hematocrit category of 51. 0% to
53. 9%, while not meeting the conventional definition for polycythemia, also showed an increased risk of 30-day postoperative mortality. When we analyzed the outcomes associated with the conventional definition of anemia and polycythemia using the "hematocrit deviation from normal range" variable, we found a 1. 6% increase in the adjusted risk of 30-day postoperative mortality for every percentage point of hematocrit deviation from the normal range. Our findings suggest that among older men undergoing elective surgery, the lowest risk of adverse outcomes was in those with preoperative hematocrit values between 39. 0% and
50. 9%. Even minimal deviations from this optimal range were associated with an increased risk of 30-day postoperative mortality and cardiac events. Future studies should determine if treatment of preoperative anemia and polycythemia improve the postoperative outcomes of this vulnerable population.
