## Question

How should we manage an ESRD patient on HD who presents with AHRF and volume overload?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage an ESRD patient on maintenance hemodialysis who presents with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and clinically significant volume overload. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization of oxygenation and airway. Then, I should differentiate whether hypoxemia is predominantly cardiogenic pulmonary edema versus ARDS or another process. Next, I will plan the respiratory support strategy with attention to lung–kidney interactions. After that, I must select the most appropriate RRT modality and ultrafiltration targets based on hemodynamic stability. Then, I will outline hemodynamic support to prevent HIRRT and myocardial stunning. Finally, I will specify monitoring, reassessment, and disposition planning, including long-term volume management and adherence support.

> Let me first confirm the immediate priorities: secure oxygenation/ventilation, begin objective assessment of fluid excess, and preserve hemodynamics while planning controlled fluid removal; I need to ensure these proceed in parallel rather than sequentially in a patient with AHRF and pulmonary edema on ESRD, because delay in any one domain worsens the others. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — rapid ultrafiltration without a plan can precipitate intradialytic hypotension and myocardial stunning; a staged approach with protective ventilation is safer while we define dry weight and tolerance to fluid removal [^114RvxAV] [^111nzBEe].

> Next, I should review the likely etiologies of hypoxemia and verify the contribution of fluid overload versus noncardiogenic processes. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema from interdialytic accumulation is highly probable in ESRD, especially after the long interval, but I must actively exclude ARDS, infection, pulmonary calcification, and dialysis-related lung injury phenomena because these are common co-travelers and change management if present [^111nJYDz] [^115edRsk]. I will now examine bedside tools: lung ultrasound to quantify extravascular lung water (B-lines) and track change with UF, echocardiography for LV function and pulmonary pressures, and ABG to characterize the hypoxemic pattern; chest radiography is supportive but insensitive early, and BNP interpretation is limited in ESRD due to chronically elevated baselines — wait, let me verify that BNP limitation is real — yes, diagnostic utility is reduced in advanced renal dysfunction, so I should not over-weight it in the differential here [^111EG6UV].

> For initial respiratory support, I need to match severity to modality while protecting hemodynamics. If hypoxemia is mild to moderate, high-flow nasal cannula can reduce work of breathing and provide modest PEEP; if moderate to severe or rapidly worsening, I should consider noninvasive ventilation cautiously only when the patient can protect the airway and hypercapnia is a driver, because strong evidence for NIV is in hypercapnic COPD rather than isolated hypoxemia — wait, I should double-check that — correct, ERS/ATS and BTS/ICS recommendations center on hypercapnic failure, and NIV should not delay intubation when hypoxemia is refractory [^113XQkSF] [^112LeyY1] [^1127HLbY]. If severe hypoxemia persists or NIV is contraindicated, I will intubate and employ lung-protective ventilation with 4–8 mL/kg predicted body weight and careful PEEP titration, remembering that higher PEEP may reduce venous return and preload; I need to balance oxygenation against hemodynamic compromise and impending UF needs [^116YETcU].

> Now, I should confirm the lung–kidney interaction risks that can derail progress. Rapid shifts in acid–base status and osmolality during intermittent HD can worsen lung mechanics and hemodynamics; the ADQI consensus warns that RRT itself can influence pulmonary function via hemodynamic, inflammatory, and electrolyte-mediated effects, so I need to avoid abrupt corrections, especially early in the course [^116frfnz]. Hmm, wait a minute — does earlier RRT initiation in ARDS necessarily improve outcomes? No, earlier initiation has not shown outcome benefit in severe AKI with ARDS, reinforcing that timing should be individualized to fluid and metabolic indications rather than a fixed clock [^116frfnz].

> With hemodynamics in mind, I need to select the RRT modality pragmatically. If the patient is hemodynamically unstable or requires significant vasopressor support, CRRT or SLED offers slower, more precise fluid and solute removal with better tolerance; if stable, modified IHD with extended time and conservative UF can be reasonable, but I should remain vigilant for HIRRT and myocardial stunning [^115vRS8H] [^116nN6CH] [^113cdHcT]. Hold on, I should verify the comparative outcome data — evidence does not show clear mortality superiority of CRRT over IHD in general, but modality choice should hinge on hemodynamic profile, goals, and local expertise; renal recovery signals are mixed across eras and cohorts, so personalization is key [^115NxzgB] [^111ETXGD].

> Turning to the ultrafiltration prescription, I need to ensure objective, staged volume removal rather than aggressive single-session targets. Let me consider tools: lung ultrasound to trend B-lines, bioimpedance to estimate extracellular water, and IVC dynamics to gauge refilling; clinical exam alone is insufficiently sensitive and specific in ESRD, and dry weight estimation is notoriously error-prone, so I should triangulate multiple measures and the patient's historical post-dialysis nadir [^11212qFS] [^115fjKWG]. I should avoid UF rates above approximately 13 mL/kg/hr when possible, extend treatment time, use cooler dialysate, and accept staged achievement of target weight over 2–3 sessions to limit intradialytic hypotension and end-organ hypoperfusion; I will double-check that guidance — yes, Renal Association recommendations support these adjustments explicitly [^114RvxAV] [^111nzBEe].

> I need to proactively prevent and manage HIRRT during RRT. Before dialysis, holding short-acting antihypertensives, pre-dosing midodrine in patients with recurrent intradialytic hypotension, using dialysate temperature at or below 36°C, and considering sodium profiling can improve tolerance; during sessions, relative blood volume monitoring and prompt response to symptomatic drops with UF pause, small saline boluses if needed, and positional maneuvers are essential while I reassess the UF goal and cardiac function if instability recurs [^114RvxAV] [^113cdHcT]. But wait, what if recurrent hypotension persists despite these measures? I should verify for autonomic dysfunction and myocardial stunning, which are common in fluid-overloaded ESRD and may limit reserve, prompting further cardiology evaluation and UF re-staging [^114JMUgN].

> Adjunctive measures must complement extracorporeal therapy. If residual urine output exists, cautious loop diuretics can assist; in refractory volume overload with concomitant heart failure, guideline-directed therapy and, in select cases, ultrafiltration as per heart failure guidance may be considered; for chronic prevention, strict sodium restriction and realistic fluid limits reduce IDWG and downstream pulmonary congestion, and patient education improves adherence, which is particularly critical after destabilizing events or access issues [^115wpsJi] [^115TmtmT] [^112wYPEW]. Let me reconsider alternatives if recurrent pulmonary edema persists despite optimized HD — transition to PD or hybrid schedules may better control volume in selected patients with repeated intolerance to IHD UF, acknowledging individualized trade-offs [^116mWRLn].

> Monitoring and reassessment should be continuous and data-driven. I should confirm hourly vitals, symptoms, and blood volume trends during RRT with dynamic UF adjustments, then re-evaluate post-session with lung ultrasound to document reduction in B-lines, weight against the evolving target, ABG for oxygenation improvement, and delayed hypotension surveillance; within 24–48 hours, repeating echocardiography if function is uncertain and re-checking bioimpedance can refine the remaining fluid excess and inform the next UF stage [^114RvxAV] [^116nN6CH] [^11212qFS]. Hold on, I should verify that meticulous intake–output and objective reassessment correlate with outcomes — yes, fluid balance precision is central to better pulmonary gas exchange and organ perfusion in critical illness with fluid overload [^116GZr6X].

> For disposition and longer-term strategy, if respiratory failure resolves with volume correction, I should adjust the outpatient dry weight downward, reinforce sodium and fluid counseling, and consider short-term weekly LUS or bioimpedance to prevent rebound overload; if dyspnea persists, I need to re-open the differential for infection, ARDS, pulmonary hypertension/calcification, anemia, or OSA, and re-evaluate modality and schedule, including SLED, more frequent HD, or PD transitions where appropriate [^115iCwD5] [^116mWRLn] [^111ziNcW]. I should confirm that high IDWG and long-interval stresses are major contributors to cardiopulmonary events in HD, guiding education and schedule adjustments to blunt those peaks [^115edRsk].

> Key synthesis and caveats: I need to balance three competing hazards — pulmonary edema from persistent overload, intradialytic hypotension/myocardial stunning from overly rapid UF, and ventilator-induced lung injury from overly aggressive ventilatory settings — and the plan must explicitly mitigate each simultaneously [^116frfnz]. I should double-check that our core guardrails are evidence-aligned: lung-protective ventilation with careful PEEP titration, individualized RRT modality emphasizing hemodynamic stability, and staged UF guided by objective congestion indices rather than symptoms alone; early RRT start for ARDS per se has not improved outcomes, so indications should remain fluid/metabolic driven, not calendar driven [^116YETcU] [^115vRS8H] [^114RvxAV] [^116frfnz].

> Putting this into a clear bedside algorithm, I will: stabilize oxygenation (HFNC → NIV only if hypercapnic and appropriate → intubation with 4–8 mL/kg PBW if severe), quantify congestion objectively (LUS, bioimpedance, echo), choose RRT modality by hemodynamics (CRRT/SLED if unstable; modified IHD if stable), prescribe gradual UF with extended time and cool dialysate while avoiding UF > 13 mL/kg/hr when feasible, implement HIRRT prevention (hold antihypertensives, consider midodrine, sodium/UF profiling), and re-assess after each session with LUS/weight/ABG to iterate until euvolemia and respiratory stability are achieved; throughout, I will preserve hemodynamics and avoid abrupt acid–base shifts to protect the lungs [^113XQkSF] [^114RvxAV] [^116YETcU] [^116frfnz]. Hold on, I should verify one last time that each step is justified by the guideline corpus — yes, this aligns with ESICM for ARDS ventilation, Renal Association for UF and dialysate temperature, ERS/ATS for NIV indications, and ADQI for lung–kidney crosstalk caution, completing a coherent, reference-based approach [^116YETcU] [^114RvxAV] [^113XQkSF] [^116frfnz].

For ESRD patients on HD presenting with AHRF and volume overload, the priority is **urgent fluid removal** via immediate hemodialysis [^11212qFS] with controlled ultrafiltration [^113fbroc] to achieve dry weight and relieve pulmonary edema [^116frfnz]. If hemodynamically unstable, use **CRRT or SLED** [^115vRS8H] for gentler fluid removal [^113cdHcT]. Start oxygen and escalate to **NIV [^113XQkSF] or invasive ventilation** if needed, using lung-protective strategies (tidal volume 4–8 mL/kg PBW [^116YETcU], plateau pressure ≤ 30 cm H₂O, PEEP 5–10 cm H₂O). Avoid **diuretics**, monitor electrolytes and acid–base status closely, and reassess volume status with clinical exam, lung ultrasound, and bioimpedance [^115iCwD5]. Address precipitating causes, prevent recurrence with strict fluid and sodium restrictions, and adjust the dialysis prescription to maintain euvolemia [^111nzBEe].

---

## Immediate clinical assessment and stabilization

- **Airway and breathing**: Ensure airway patency and initiate supplemental oxygen to maintain SpO₂ ≥ 92%. Escalate to noninvasive ventilation (NIV) [^113XQkSF] if respiratory distress or hypercapnia persists, and proceed to invasive mechanical ventilation if NIV fails or the patient deteriorates.

- **Circulation**: Assess hemodynamic stability. Hypotension or shock may necessitate vasopressor support (e.g. norepinephrine) to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥ 65 mmHg.

- **Volume status**: Perform a rapid clinical assessment (jugular venous distension, peripheral edema, lung crackles) [^115fjKWG] and obtain chest radiography to confirm pulmonary edema.

---

## Dialysis management and fluid removal

### Immediate dialysis initiation

- **Urgent hemodialysis**: Initiate immediate hemodialysis [^11212qFS] with controlled ultrafiltration [^113fbroc] to remove excess fluid and achieve dry weight. This is the cornerstone of management for volume overload in ESRD patients [^115wpsJi].

- **Ultrafiltration rate**: Target an ultrafiltration rate of 8–10 mL/kg/h, adjusted based on hemodynamic tolerance and patient stability.

- **Dialysate composition**: Use a dialysate sodium concentration of 138–140 mmol/L to minimize intradialytic hypotension and muscle cramps.

- **Dialysate temperature**: Maintain dialysate temperature at 35–36°C to reduce intradialytic hypotension risk [^114RvxAV].

---

### Alternative dialysis modalities

Consider **continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)** or **sustained low-efficiency dialysis (SLED)** for hemodynamically unstable patients [^116nN6CH] to enable gentler fluid removal and improve hemodynamic stability [^113cdHcT].

---

## Respiratory support and ventilation strategies

- **Noninvasive ventilation (NIV)**: Initiate NIV (e.g. bilevel positive airway pressure) for hypercapnic respiratory failure, particularly in COPD exacerbations [^112LeyY1] or obesity hypoventilation syndrome [^1174hykS].

- **Invasive mechanical ventilation**: If NIV fails or the patient deteriorates, initiate invasive mechanical ventilation with lung-protective strategies:

	- **Tidal volume**: 4–8 mL/kg predicted body weight (PBW) [^116YETcU].

	- **Plateau pressure**: ≤ 30 cm H₂O [^116YETcU].

	- **Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)**: 5–10 cm H₂O, adjusted to minimize alveolar collapse and improve oxygenation.

- **Avoidance of fluid overload**: Carefully monitor fluid balance during mechanical ventilation to prevent exacerbation of pulmonary edema [^116frfnz].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment of dialysis prescription

Regularly reassess **volume status** with clinical examination, lung ultrasound, and bioimpedance spectroscopy [^11212qFS] to guide ultrafiltration targets and prevent intradialytic hypotension [^115iCwD5]. Closely monitor serum electrolytes (potassium, calcium, bicarbonate) and acid–base status, adjusting the dialysis prescription as needed [^116mWRLn]. Remove fluid gradually to avoid rapid shifts that precipitate intradialytic hypotension, myocardial stunning, or cerebral edema [^111nzBEe].

---

## Pharmacological considerations

Diuretics are generally **ineffective** in ESRD because residual renal function is minimal; loop diuretics may be considered if meaningful urine output persists, though efficacy is limited. Vasodilators such as nitroglycerin or nitroprusside can be used cautiously to reduce preload and afterload, improving cardiac output and oxygenation. If bronchospasm contributes to respiratory distress, administer inhaled bronchodilators (e.g. albuterol).

---

## Complications and preventive strategies

Prevent **intradialytic hypotension** [^114RvxAV] through careful ultrafiltration rate adjustment, dialysate sodium profiling, and appropriate patient positioning. Monitor for and promptly correct electrolyte disturbances, including hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and metabolic acidosis [^116mWRLn]. Maintain strict aseptic technique during catheter manipulation to prevent catheter-related bloodstream infections [^116mWRLn].

---

## Long-term management and prevention of recurrence

Long-term management centers on **patient education** [^112wYPEW] to reinforce adherence to fluid and sodium restrictions, regular dialysis sessions, and medication adherence. Individualize the dialysis prescription — frequency, duration, and ultrafiltration targets — to maintain euvolemia and prevent recurrent volume overload [^115fjKWG]. Arrange regular follow-up to monitor volume status, cardiovascular health, and dialysis adequacy [^114RvxAV].

### Volume overload in hemodialysis: Diagnosis, cardiovascular consequences, and management [^11212qFS]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Low credibility.

Fluid overload is a major risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in the hemodialysis (HD) population. Volume overload underlies hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and dysfunction, as well as pulmonary circulation overload in these patients, and is a major contributor to the dire prognosis of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Dry weight assessment in clinical practice still rests on subjective evaluation of patient signs and symptoms rather than on objective measurements. However, clinical criteria to evaluate fluid balance are notoriously unreliable, and for this reason, volume overload goes undetected in HD patients. Inaccurate evaluation of fluid volume status may lead to incorrect antihypertensive drug use and ultrafiltration prescriptions.

The diagnosis of subclinical volume overload in HD patients has been a matter of research for decades. Bioimpedance spectroscopy is a widely used technique that provides reliable estimates of fluid overload in these patients; however, adequately powered clinical trials based on clinical endpoints for recommending this technique as a useful instrument to guide ultrafiltration prescription in clinical practice are still lacking. Lung ultrasound (US) subjectively quantifies interstitial fluid accumulation in a critical area of the central circulation, like the lung. Recent evidence suggests that the application of this method may be useful to safely reduce ambulatory blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive HD patients. Whether a lung US-guided treatment strategy can decrease major outcomes in high-risk HD patients remains to be answered by the ongoing LUST study. Apart from optimal dry weight estimation, management strategies require further exploration.

Regarding respiratory support for acute respiratory distress syndrome, more specifically with respect to mechanical ventilation and tidal volume targets, ESICM 2023 guidelines recommend using low tidal volume ventilation strategies (4–8 mL/kg predicted body weight) over high tidal volumes (traditionally used to normalize blood gases) to reduce mortality in patients with ARDS not due to COVID-19.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^113fbroc]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

The two main treatment parameters by which clinicians aim to optimize fluid control are target weight and ultrafiltration rate. Since the earliest days of dialysis, setting ultrafiltration to achieve a set target weight post-dialysis, at which the patient is at their correct volume ("dry"), has been the accepted method of maintaining a consistent volume state. However, this method depends on accurately estimating the correct target weight. Although most often assessed by clinical examination, the inaccuracy of this method is widely recognized, leading to both overestimation and underestimation. Overestimation contributes to hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, while underestimation accelerates the loss of residual kidney function and potentially increases the risk of myocardial stunning.

To improve upon clinical assessment, nephrologists once advocated "probing" target weight through gradual reduction until patients reported symptoms suggesting hypovolemia. However, this approach may reduce treatment compliance. A more common and collaborative approach involves encouraging patients to participate in monitoring their fluid status. To this end, terminology should be straightforward and easily understood. For example, the term "dry weight" can imply that the goal is to remove as much fluid as possible, and "ideal weight" can be confusing as it is also used to describe the preferred body mass index. Although less precise, "hydration" is a more familiar term than "volume" for describing fluid status. Stable patients should be assessed regularly.

### Obstructive sleep apnea severity and overnight body fluid shift before and after hemodialysis [^111ziNcW]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with significantly increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Fluid overload may promote obstructive sleep apnea in patients with ESRD through an overnight fluid shift from the legs to the neck soft tissues. Body fluid shift and severity of obstructive sleep apnea before and after hemodialysis were compared in patients with ESRD.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: Seventeen patients with hemodialysis and moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea were included. Polysomnographies were performed the night before and after hemodialysis to assess obstructive sleep apnea, and bioimpedance was used to measure fluid overload and leg fluid volume.

- **Results**: The mean overnight rostral fluid shift was 1.27 ± 0.41 L prehemodialysis; it correlated positively with fluid overload volume (r = 0.39; P = 0.02) and was significantly lower posthemodialysis (0.78 ± 0.38 L; P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the mean obstructive apnea-hypopnea index before and after hemodialysis (46.8 ± 22.0 versus 42.1 ± 18.6 per hour; P = 0.21), but obstructive apnea-hypopnea index was significantly lower posthemodialysis (-10.1 ± 10.8 per hour) in the group of 12 patients, with a concomitant reduction of fluid overload compared with participants without change in fluid overload (obstructive apnea-hypopnea index +8.2 ± 16.1 per hour; P < 0.01). A lower fluid overload after hemodialysis was significantly correlated (r = 0.49; P = 0.04) with a lower obstructive apnea-hypopnea index. Fluid overload assessed by bioimpedance was the best predictor of…

### Renal replacement therapy [^115vRS8H]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Over the past two decades, the approach to renal replacement therapy (RRT) in critically ill patients has shifted markedly from early, largely empirical practices toward more individualized, evidence-based strategies. Large randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the safety of applying a watch-and-wait strategy in the absence of urgent complications, while technical advances and refined dosing recommendations have improved safety and efficiency. This evolution supports a patient-centered model of care, integrating clinical judgment, therapeutic goals, and available resources to guide the initiation, modality choice, and discontinuation of RRT.

- **Standard of care**: This article presents the key elements of the standard of care for RRT in the intensive care setting. Anticoagulation strategies and vascular access considerations are addressed in Figure 1 but are not discussed in the main text.

Renal replacement therapy in ICU includes RRT (renal replacement therapy), AKI (acute kidney injury), CRRT (continuous renal replacement therapy), IHD (intermittent hemodialysis), SLED (sustained low-efficiency dialysis), PIRRT (prolonged intermittent renal replacement therapy), and Kt/V where K represents clearance, t represents time, and V represents volume.

### Respiratory considerations in the patient with renal failure [^111nJYDz]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

Lung and kidney function are intimately related in both health and disease. Respiratory changes help to mitigate the systemic effects of renal acid-base disturbances, and the reverse is also true, although renal compensation occurs more slowly than its respiratory counterpart. A large number of diseases affect both the lungs and the kidneys, presenting most often with alveolar hemorrhage and glomerulonephritis. Most of these conditions are uncommon or rare, although three of them — Wegener's granulomatosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Goodpasture's syndrome — are not infrequently encountered by respiratory care clinicians.

Respiratory complications of chronic renal failure include pulmonary edema, fibrinous pleuritis, pulmonary calcification, and a predisposition to tuberculosis. Urinothorax is a rare entity associated with obstructive uropathy. Sleep disturbances are extremely common in patients with end-stage renal disease, with sleep apnea occurring in 60% or more of such patients.

The management of patients with acute renal failure is frequently complicated by pulmonary edema and the effects of both fluid overload and metabolic acidosis. These processes affect the management of mechanical ventilation in such patients and may interfere with weaning. Successful lung-protective ventilation in patients with acute lung injury and renal failure may require modification of hemodialysis in order to combat severe acidemia. Hemodialysis-related hypoxemia, which was once believed to be the result of pulmonary leukostasis and complement activation, is explained by diffusion of.

### Timing of dialysis initiation in acute kidney injury and acute-on-chronic renal failure [^1129jrwE]. Seminars in Dialysis (2013). Low credibility.

The decision to provide dialytic support and determine the ideal moment to initiate therapy presents common challenges for physicians treating patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). Although renal replacement therapy (RRT) has been extensively used in clinical practice for more than 30 years, there is a paucity of evidence to guide clinicians on the optimal utilization of RRT in AKI. In the absence of traditional or urgent indications, there is no consensus on whether dialysis should be offered and when it should be started.

The lack of agreed-upon parameters to guide the decision, fear of the procedure's risks, and potential contribution to worse prognosis with RRT have led to considerable variation in practice among physicians and centers. In this review, we summarize the evidence evaluating the timing of RRT initiation and discuss possible approaches for future trials to address this issue.

### Why and how high volume hemodiafiltration may reduce cardiovascular mortality in stage 5 chronic kidney disease dialysis patients? A comprehensive literature review on mechanisms involved [^112DhY1p]. Seminars in Dialysis (2022). Low credibility.

Online hemodiafiltration (HDF) is an established renal replacement modality for patients with end-stage chronic kidney disease that is now gaining rapid clinical acceptance worldwide. Currently, there is a growing body of evidence indicating that treatment with HDF is associated with better outcomes and reduced cardiovascular mortality for dialysis patients. In this comprehensive review, we provide an update on the potential mechanisms that may improve survival in HDF-treated patients.

The strongest evidence is for better hemodynamic stability and reduced endothelial dysfunction associated with HDF treatments. Clinically, this is marked by a reduced incidence of intradialytic hypotensive episodes and a better hemodynamic response to ultrafiltration. This response is mediated by an increase in total peripheral vascular resistance and extra-vascular fluid recruitment, most likely driven by the negative thermal balance associated with online HDF therapy. In addition, endothelial function appears to improve due to a combination of reduced inflammatory and oxidative stress complex syndrome and decreased exposure to circulating cardiovascular uremic toxins.

Reports of reversed cardiovascular remodeling effects with HDF may be confounded by volume and blood pressure management, which are strongly linked to center clinical practices. Currently, treatment with HDF appears to improve the survival of dialysis patients predominantly due to a reduction in their cardiovascular burden, and this reduction is linked to the sessional convection volume exchanged.

### Initiation of dialysis should be timely: neither early nor late [^1125Gsji]. Seminars in Dialysis (2013). Low credibility.

Over the last decade, individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States have been starting maintenance dialysis therapy at progressively higher estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR). Several observational studies have demonstrated an association between a higher risk of death and higher serum creatinine-based estimates of GFR at the time of initiation of dialysis. In contrast, studies measuring renal function through timed urinary collection show either a lower risk of death or no significant association with higher GFR at initiation.

There are numerous potential sources of bias in these observational studies, particularly in those using serum creatinine-based eGFR. The only randomized controlled clinical trial addressing this issue did not demonstrate either benefit or harm with the initiation of dialysis at a higher level of renal function. Thus, the data at the time of writing suggest that eGFR should not be the sole consideration when assessing the need for initiating maintenance dialysis in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease.

Given the high societal costs of starting renal replacement therapy earlier in the disease course, these considerations suggest that dialysis can be safely postponed in otherwise asymptomatic individuals with advanced chronic kidney disease. Dialysis should not be denied to individuals who could clearly benefit from renal replacement therapy simply because the GFR is too high, as in cases of volume overload or refractory hyperkalemia.

### Starting dialysis is dangerous: How do we balance the risk [^116VgPHY]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

Recent studies on the timing of dialysis initiation have challenged the trend towards earlier therapy initiation. The observed outcomes are a consequence of balancing the risks of advanced uremia against the inherent dangers associated with dialysis therapy itself. Many of these risks are inherent in the current practices of dialysis treatment and may be mitigated through refinement of clinical procedures and potentially the choice of modality. This article discusses how patient outcomes result from balancing these factors, focusing on the vulnerability of individual patients to these risks.

### Fluid overload in the ICU: Evaluation and management [^111Xaw8j]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

The ultimate goal is to preserve tissue perfusion, optimizing fluid balance by effectively removing fluid without compromising the effective circulating fluid volume; therefore, meticulous monitoring of fluid balance is critical for all patients.

Another option for treating patients with fluid overload is using new, smaller, and more portable devices like the Aquadex FlexFlow System (Baxter Healthcare). In patients with heart failure, Costanzo et al. compare adjustable ultrafiltration using a small ultrafiltration device to the use of intravenous loop diuretics. The authors found a trend towards a longer time to recurrence of heart failure within 90 days after hospital discharge in patients treated with the ultrafiltration device, and fewer heart failure and cardiovascular events. Changes in renal function and the 90-day mortality were similar in both groups. However, more patients randomized to adjustable ultrafiltration experienced an adverse effect of special interest (p = 0.018) and a serious study product-related adverse event (p = 0.026).

Congestive heart failure (CHF) and hyperkalemia are the two leading reasons for emergency dialysis among individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). While hemodialysis provides definitive treatment of both hyperkalemia and volume overload among ESRD patients, for those who present outside of "regular dialysis hours", the initiation of dialysis may be delayed. Nondialytic management can be instituted immediately and should be the initial therapy in the management of hyperkalemia and CHF in these individuals.

Available evidence does not allow conclusions as to whether treatment with nondialytic strategies alone results in different outcomes than nondialytic strategies coupled with emergent hemodialysis. Therefore, whether or not nondialytic management alone is appropriate remains a matter of individual judgment that should be decided on a case-by-case basis.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^114RvxAV]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Fluid assessment and management in adults**: We recommend assessment of fluid status when prompted by clinical circumstances and on a quarterly basis for stable patients. We suggest a multidisciplinary approach to fluid assessment, with patient involvement and the adoption of patient-friendly terminology such as "target weight", "fluid gain", and "over-hydration". We suggest supplementing clinical assessment of fluid status with a validated objective measurement, such as bioimpedance, at regular intervals, when clinical assessment is unclear, and following an inter-illness. We recommend a dialysate temperature not greater than 36°C if standardized. We recommend avoiding excessive ultrafiltration rates by addressing fluid gains, accepting staged achievement of target weight, or using an augmented schedule, as necessary. We recommend prompt nursing intervention to restore hemodynamic stability in symptomatic or severe intradialytic hypotension, with such interventions leading to clinical review.

- **Rationale**: Fluid control is an essential clinical goal of maintenance haemodialysis. Correct fluid management requires clinicians to steer between the two competing and overlapping problems of fluid overload and intradialytic hypotension. Failure to control fluid overload may lead to obvious short-term effects, including hypertension and breathlessness, and nephrology trainees quickly become familiar with the emergency dialysis admission with pulmonary oedema. In the longer term, chronic fluid overload is one of the main concerns.

### Update of dialysis initiation timing in end stage kidney disease patients: Is it a resolved question? A systematic literature review [^115brG9V]. BMC Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

A number of studies have focused on the comprehensive assessment of uremic signs and/or symptoms for optimal dialysis initiation. Chang et al. quantified the uremic burden based on seven uremic indicators that reached predefined thresholds: hemoglobin, serum albumin, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, potassium, phosphorus, and bicarbonate. Dialysis timing was classified as standard (0–2 uremic indicators), late (3–5 indicators), and very late (6–7 indicators); no correlation was found between the late or very late groups and mortality. Ying et al. developed an equation based on fuzzy mathematics to assess the timing of hemodialysis initiation. Results indicated that the combination of sex, age, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, serum albumin, hemoglobin, serum phosphorus, diabetes mellitus, and heart failure as variables resulted in the best accuracy for predicting 3-year survival.

Matthew et al. categorized the documented primary indications for dialysis initiation into four groups: laboratory evidence of kidney function decline (reference category), uremic symptoms, volume overload or hypertension, and other/unknown. They found that volume overload or hypertension was associated with the highest risk for subsequent mortality. These studies highlight the future directions for comprehensive evaluation of dialysis timing, especially in patients experiencing volume overload and complications sensitive to volume changes during dialysis, mainly varied causes of cardiovascular instabilities.

It is well known that the main functions of peritoneal dialysis (PD) or hemodialysis (HD) are to remove excess substances and waste products from the bloodstream.

### Kidney dysfunction requiring dialysis is a heterogeneous syndrome: we should treat it like one [^111d616v]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2022). Low credibility.

Advanced kidney failure requiring dialysis, commonly labeled as end-stage kidney disease or chronic kidney disease stage 5D, is a heterogeneous syndrome. This is a key reason why treating advanced kidney dysfunction is challenging and why many clinical trials involving patients on dialysis have failed thus far. Treatment with dialytic techniques — of which maintenance thrice-weekly hemodialysis is most commonly used — is broadly named kidney 'replacement' therapy. This term casts the perception of a priori abandonment of intrinsic kidney function and subsumes patients into a single, homogeneous group.

Recent findings indicate that patients with advanced kidney failure necessitating dialytic therapy may have ongoing endogenous kidney function. They differ in their clinical manifestations and needs. Different terminology, such as kidney dysfunction requiring dialysis (KDRD) with stages of progressive severity, could better capture the range of phenotypes in patients who require kidney 'assistance' therapy.

Classifying patients with KDRD based on objective, quantitative levels of endogenous kidney function, as well as patient-reported symptoms and quality of life, would facilitate hemodialysis prescriptions tailored to the level of kidney dysfunction, clinical needs, and personal priorities. Such classification would encourage clinicians to move toward a personalized, physiological, and adaptive approach to hemodialysis therapy.

### Volume overload and adverse outcomes in chronic kidney disease: Clinical observational and animal studies [^1174uDhX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

A strength of this study is its combined use of a prospective cohort study and animal study. However, certain limitations of the study should be acknowledged. As is the case for any observational study, we were unable to establish the causality of the relationship between volume overload and outcomes. Although the results of the animal study supported the hypothesis that salt-induced volume overload could result in renal and cardiovascular damage, it was difficult to untangle the complex relationship between salt and volume. It is unclear whether the relationship involved salt toxicity or adverse effects from fluid retention.

Another limitation was the lack of data regarding the dietary salt and fluid intake in CKD patients. As shown in Table 1, 113 (33.4%) of study participants were receiving diuretic treatment. Twenty-four-hour urinary sodium excretion is a good proxy for salt intake in the steady state, but it can be falsely elevated in patients taking a diuretic. Furthermore, patients on diuretic therapy might have different levels of hydration status during the course of the day, and there is room for misinterpretation of hydration status in such patients.

Finally, the overall CVD event rate was low in the present study, as reflected by a relatively wide CI in the secondary endpoint. Although CKD patients in Western countries frequently die of CVD before developing ESRD, CKD patients in Taiwan are more likely to develop ESRD than to have a cardiovascular event. The limited number of CVD events also limits the ability to adjust for other potentially confounding factors.

### Volume overload in hemodialysis: Diagnosis, cardiovascular consequences, and management [^115edRsk]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Low credibility.

In the same vein, interdialytic volume accumulation during the long interval is accompanied by dilatation of the left and right cardiac chambers, pulmonary circulation overload, and diastolic dysfunction in these patients. Cardiac chambers dilatation and interdialytic weight gain (IDWG) are closely associated, indicating that the stretching of cardiac chambers between sessions results in long-term cardiac chamber remodeling. The long (3-day) interdialytic interval is associated with more pronounced left and right atrial enlargement and right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) increase. The IDWG is the strongest factor driving the increase in RVSP, suggesting that continuous volume accumulation underlies not only left but also right atrium enlargement and pulmonary overload. In clinical practice, higher IDWG prompts the prescription of higher ultrafiltration volumes, which in turn leads to diastolic dysfunction and myocardial stunning, possibly due to a rapid decrease in the intravascular fluid compartment. The increase in central blood pressure accompanying interdialytic volume accumulation directly increases cardiac afterload and raises myocardial oxygen demand, thereby favoring the occurrence of acute ischemic cardiac events.

Volume overload is considered a major underlying risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular death in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Large studies focusing on IDWG, a proxy of volume overload and the simplest biomarker of fluid overload, have coherently exposed the potential deleterious effects of volume expansion on survival and cardiac health.

### Volume management in haemodialysis patients [^111nzBEe]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Low credibility.

Accumulating evidence supports the important contribution of volume-related metrics to morbidity and mortality in patients receiving chronic haemodialysis. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent advances in the understanding and management of volume status in this high-risk group.

- **Recent findings**: Delivery of optimal volume management involves three key components: accurate estimation of volume status, correction of extracellular fluid overload, and prevention of intradialytic instability. The lack of a gold standard for assessing volume status makes accurate estimation difficult to achieve; clinical examination has insufficient sensitivity and specificity, while tools to assist in the objective measurement of extracellular fluid volume require further validation. Hypervolemia is common in patients on chronic haemodialysis and substantially increases the risk of morbidity and mortality. Rapid correction of hypervolemia should be avoided due to the risk of precipitating intradialytic hypotension and hypoperfusion of vital end-organs, including the heart, brain, liver, gut, and kidneys. Evidence-based interventions to aid in normalizing extracellular fluid volume are urgently needed; several targeted strategies are currently being evaluated. Many centres have successfully implemented local protocols and programmes to enhance volume management.

- **Summary**: Achieving normal volume status is a fundamental goal of haemodialysis. Novel methods of assessing and restoring extracellular fluid volume while maintaining intradialytic stability are currently under development.

### Lung-kidney interactions in critically ill patients: Consensus report of the Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) 21 workgroup [^116frfnz]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

- **Effects of extracorporeal devices**: Question: What is the impact of RRT on lung function?

- **Consensus statements**: RRT applied for diuretic-resistant fluid overload may improve pulmonary function. There is little evidence that RRT, using methods, directly leads to lung injury. The pathophysiological mechanisms of the potential association between RRT and lung function comprise haemodynamic, inflammatory, electrolyte-mediated, and acid–base effects.

- **Rationale**: RRT is usually initiated to compensate for complications of AKI. This includes fluid overload in patients with diuretic resistance, repeatedly described as a major risk factor for adverse outcome. Early correction of fluid accumulation may be important to reduce further damage to the injured lung. However, earlier initiation of RRT in patients with severe AKI and ARDS has not been shown to improve outcome.

Data on the direct effects of RRT on the lung are sparse and mostly from patients with ESRD receiving IHD. Alternating episodes of volume depletion and overload, and leukocyte activation resulting from IHD, have been identified as triggers for deterioration of lung function. Few studies have compared the impact of different RRT modalities on respiratory function in AKI patients, having found no significant difference between modalities (peritoneal dialysis vs. IHD and IHD and SLED).

Rapid correction of acid–base balance during intermittent haemodialysis may also impact the lungs and should be avoided when commencing RRT. When RRT is delivered to COPD patients with metabolic compensation, it may cause eventual complications.

### Volume overload in hemodialysis: diagnosis, cardiovascular consequences, and management [^115pMSsw]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Low credibility.

Over the past few years, mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing hemodialysis (HD) has only slightly decreased. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality, accounting for over 50% of deaths with known causes, while cardiovascular mortality is nine-fold higher in these patients compared with age- and sex-matched individuals in the general population. Cardiovascular events, such as sudden death and hospitalization for heart failure, show a specific weekly pattern in HD patients. These events are 25–40% higher during the first-weekly HD day (Monday or Tuesday) compared with any other weekday and concentrate within the last hours of the three-day interval and the following session.

Several factors may be responsible for the increased cardiovascular mortality in dialysis patients, but sodium and volume overload are considered among the main mechanisms of this association. In ESRD patients, the kidneys are unable to maintain sodium and water homeostasis. Because of the intermittent nature of the thrice-weekly hemodialysis regimen, excessive interdialytic weight gain (IDWG) and the consequent excessive intradialytic weight loss constitute a cyclical cardiovascular stress. Sodium and volume accumulation is inevitably larger during the three-day interdialytic interval, which elevates pre-dialysis and ambulatory blood pressure (BP) levels as well as wave reflections — augmentation index (AIx) and augmentation pressure (AP) — from the periphery. Hypervolemia is also a frequent condition in peritoneal dialysis patients.

### Pulmonary complications of renal disorders [^112v5zkV]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

To manage patients with diseases of the lungs and the kidneys, one must first understand the relationship between respiratory and renal function. In treating acute renal failure (ARF), the clinician often must contend with respiratory manifestations of volume overload and metabolic acidosis. Mechanical ventilation in patients with renal failure (RF) can be challenging, particularly with lung protective ventilation and weaning. Patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) experience several respiratory complications. Hypoxaemia during dialysis is now understood to be a predictable effect of the loss of CO₂ into the dialysate. Critical illness of any primary cause predisposes patients not only to acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) but also to the development of ARF. Meanwhile, the potential for ventilator-induced renal injury has increasingly become the subject of active investigation.

### Volume overload in hemodialysis: Diagnosis, cardiovascular consequences, and management [^111zaXqQ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Low credibility.

During interdialytic intervals, hemodialysis (HD) patients experience fluid accumulation. This parameter is defined by oral fluid and food-water intake minus residual urine output (when present), stool water output, sweat, and respiratory water loss. Chronic fluid overload occurs as the patient's fluid gains exceed the prescribed ultrafiltration rate needed to achieve or maintain dry weight. Higher interdialytic weight gain (IDWG) is closely associated with higher pre-dialysis blood pressure (BP) and results in a gradual upward shift in ambulatory BP levels, which worsens during the third day and night of the long interdialytic interval. Consequently, volume overload is currently considered the primary pathogenic mechanism of hypertension in the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) population. The worldwide prevalence of hypertension in this population is as high as 85%.

The increase in volume during interdialytic intervals likely contributes to short-term BP variability from Day 1 to Day 2 of the regular interdialytic interval, which has been implicated in the risk for cardiovascular events independent of BP levels. Additionally, chronic volume overload and increased IDWG are considered major factors for the BP increase that occurs in some patients during the HD session. Conversely, higher ultrafiltration volume is also associated with intradialytic hypotensive episodes. This can result in the interruption of sessions, shorter dialysis time, inappropriate adjustment of target dry weight to higher levels, or infusion of saline solutions — all factors that further complicate the management of volume overload in HD patients.

### Cardiovascular risk and mortality in end-stage renal disease patients undergoing dialysis: Sleep study, pulmonary function, respiratory mechanics, upper airway collapsibility, autonomic nervous activity, depression, anxiety, stress and quality of life: A prospective, double blind, randomized controlled clinical trial [^114S9u4M]. BMC Nephrology (2013). High credibility.

The present study involving patients with CKD was designed with four main objectives: (1) to assess the effects of dialysis on sleep parameters and determine the prevalence and severity of sleep disorders; (2) to determine the behavior of sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic nervous system activity through an analysis of heart rate variability; (3) to detect upper airway collapsibility as a risk indicator for OSA; and (4) to evaluate levels of depression, anxiety, stress, and quality of life. Our hypothesis is that the weight gain due to volume overload observed during the interdialytic period will influence the degree of collapsibility of the upper airway due to narrowing and predispose to upper airway occlusion during sleep. We aim to investigate the effects of nocturnal hemodialysis compared to daytime hemodialysis and the influences on the physiological variables of sleep, autonomic nervous system (ANS), and respiratory mechanics, thereby compromising the quality of life in chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease patients undergoing dialysis.

### Pulmonary artery pressure as a method for assessing hydration status in an anuric hemodialysis patient - a case report [^111qAiFP]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Setting the dry weight and maintaining fluid balance is still a difficult challenge in dialysis patients. Overhydration is common and associated with increased cardiac morbidity and mortality. Pulmonary hypertension is associated with volume overload in end-stage renal dysfunction patients. Thus, monitoring pulmonary pressure by a CardioMEMS device could potentially guide physicians in the difficult task of assessing fluid overload in hemodialysis patients.

- **Case presentation**: A 61-year-old male with known congestive heart failure deteriorated over 3 months from a state with congestive heart failure and diuresis to a state of chronic kidney disease and anuria. He began a thrice-weekly in-hospital hemodialysis regime. As he already had implanted a CardioMEMS device due to his heart condition, we monitored invasive pulmonary artery pressure during dialysis sessions. To compare, we estimated overhydration by both bioimpedance and clinical assessment. Pulmonary artery pressure correlated closely with fluid drainage during dialysis and interdialytic weight gain. The patient reached prescribed dry weight but remained pulmonary hypertensive by definition. During two episodes of intradialytic systemic hypotension, the patient still had pulmonary hypertension by definition.

- **Conclusion**: This case report observes a close correlation between pulmonary artery pressure and fluid overload in a limited number of observations. In this case, we found pulmonary artery pressure to be more sensitive toward fluid overload than bioimpedance.

### Continuous renal replacement therapy in the treatment of acute renal failure: Critical assessment is required [^115NxzgB]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

A continuous approach to renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for critically ill patients was introduced in 1977 and was hailed almost immediately as an improved alternative to intermittent hemodialysis (IHD). Now that CRRT has been in clinical practice for three decades, it is fair to ask whether research-based evidence (rather than expert opinion) supports the use of this complex technology in comparison to IHD. Several randomized clinical trials have compared the outcomes of CRRT and IHD. In one trial, patients assigned to CRRT had a significantly higher intensive-care mortality rate. In other recent trials, there has been no significant difference in outcome. A meta-analysis of observational studies similarly shows no benefit of CRRT versus IHD, with recent trends actually favoring IHD.

While considerable attention has been focused on perceived benefits of CRRT compared to IHD, comparatively less attention has been focused on the potential for increased risks. When examining the totality of evidence from recent observational studies and clinical trials, there is no convincing evidence to support superiority of CRRT over IHD in the treatment of critically ill patients with acute renal failure (ARF).

### Lung-kidney interactions in critically ill patients: Consensus report of the Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) 21 Workgroup [^113hz5wL]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Concomitant hypoxaemia (SaO₂ 83–87%) and hypercapnia may reduce renal blood flow in a dose-dependent manner; correspondingly, patients with hypercapnic COPD also exhibit a loss of renal functional reserve.

In ARDS patients, short-term hypoxaemia (SaO₂ 88–90%) is associated with altered renal function. Elevation of central venous pressure, due to either right heart failure, high intrathoracic pressures (e.g. occult PEEP resulting from dynamic hyperinflation), or volume overload may result in increased interstitial and tubular hydrostatic pressure within the encapsulated kidney, which decreases net glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and oxygen delivery.

- **Recommendations for research**: Identify risk factors for AKI that are specifically related to ARF/ARDS and its treatment. This may allow the recognition of preventive and therapeutic measures to limit AKI. Candidate molecules characterizing lung–kidney crosstalk should be identified, and their potential as targets for interventions investigated.

### Adherence to hemodialysis and medical regimens among patients with end-stage renal disease during COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study [^112wYPEW]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Low credibility.

Adherence of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) to hemodialysis (HD), prescribed medications, diet, and fluid restrictions is essential to achieve desirable outcomes and prevent complications. During the COVID-19 pandemic, ESRD patients became more concerned with attending the HD sessions and following protective measures due to their potential increased susceptibility to COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on patients' adherence to HD and medical regimens.

- **Methods**: Two hundred five ESRD patients on HD were interviewed using the ESRD Adherence Questionnaire (ESRD-AQ) and the Fear-of-COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S). Clinical and laboratory correlates of adherence were retrieved from patients' records.

- **Results**: Self-reported adherence to HD showed that 19.5% were not adherent during the pandemic compared to 11.7% before the pandemic (p < 0.001), with a significant agreement with the actual attendance of HD sessions (Kappa = 0.733, p < 0.001). Twenty-five patients (12.2%) had a history of COVID-19. The FCV-19S had a mean score of 18.8 and showed significant positive correlations with pre-dialysis phosphorus and potassium levels. Multivariate analysis indicated that the main predictors of non-adherence were a history of COVID-19, understanding and perception scores, and the Fear-of-COVID-19 score.

- **Conclusions**: The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected ESRD patients' adherence to HD and the medical regimen. Strategies to mitigate patients' fears of COVID-19 and improve their understanding and perceptions of adherence to HD are necessary.

### Renal failure in the ICU: Comparison of the impact of acute renal failure and end-stage renal disease on ICU outcomes [^111Qzpam]. Kidney International (2002). Low credibility.

Acute renal failure (ARF) is associated with a persistent high mortality in critically ill patients in intensive care units (ICUs). Most studies at the time of writing have focused on patients with established, intrinsic ARF or relatively severe ARF due to multiple factors. None have examined outcomes of dialysis-dependent chronic renal failure, also known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD), in the ICU. We examined the incidence and outcomes of ARF in the ICU using a standard definition and compared these to outcomes of ICU patients with either ESRD or no renal failure. Our objective was to determine the impact of renal dysfunction and/or loss of organ function on outcomes.

- **Methods**: We prospectively scored 1,530 admissions to eight ICUs over a 10-month period for illness severity at ICU admission using the Acute Physiological and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE III) evaluation tool. Patients were defined as having ARF based on the definition of Hou et al., which is designed to detect significant measurable declines in renal function based on serum creatinine. ESRD patients were identified as being chronically dialysis-dependent prior to ICU admission and the remainder had no renal failure. Clinical characteristics at ICU admission and ICU and hospital outcomes were compared between the three groups.

- **Results**: We identified 254 cases of ARF, 57 cases of ESRD, and 1,219 cases of no renal failure, with an incidence of ARF of 17%. Roughly half the ARF patients had ARF at ICU admission, and the remainder developed ARF during their ICU stay. Only 11% of ARF patients required dialysis.

### Unfavorable effects of history of volume overload and late referral to a nephrologist on mortality in patients initiating dialysis: a multicenter prospective cohort study in Japan [^111f5Q3Z]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

We defined late referral as referral to a nephrologist less than 3 months between the first nephrology evaluation and dialysis initiation. A period of 3 months before the initiation of dialysis is the most widely accepted threshold for discriminating between early referral and late referral, as it is generally considered the minimum essential time required to prepare for renal replacement therapy (e.g. creation of an arteriovenous fistula).

- **Clinical history of volume overload**: This was evaluated by investigators at each dialysis institution. Volume overload was defined based on the following objective clinical findings obtained at least once during the period from chronic kidney disease to end-stage renal disease: pulmonary congestion or pleural fluid seen on plain chest radiography and physical findings of lower extremity edema. Any incidence of volume overload occurring for the first time during the phase of dialysis induction was excluded from this definition. Volume overload history was distinguished from heart failure symptoms at the start of maintenance dialysis or past hospitalization for heart failure. Heart failure symptoms were defined as:
	- **Dyspnea or orthopnea with hypoxemia**
	- **Weight gain or jugular venous distension**

- **Coronary heart disease**: Defined as an angiographically confirmed occlusion or stenosis of one or more coronary arteries, causing myocardial infarction or angina pectoris.

- **Peripheral artery disease**: Defined as a disease requiring admission for revascularization or amputation surgery.

### The pathology of dialysis [^1152uZHx]. Seminars in Dialysis (2002). Low credibility.

There are a number of pathologies associated with the development of renal failure. Once renal function deteriorates to a point where life is not sustainable without dialysis, new sets of pathologic processes arise. These are partly related to the continuation of poor renal function and the process of dialysis itself. This article addresses the processes believed to be due to dialysis, including disorders of bone, deposition of metals and amyloid within various tissues, and local problems such as inflammation and tumors related to the dialysis site.

### Volume overload in hemodialysis: Diagnosis, cardiovascular consequences, and management [^115iCwD5]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Low credibility.

Volume overload in hemodialysis (HD) patients is associated with hypertension and cardiac dysfunction. It is a major risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in this population. The diagnosis of volume excess and estimation of dry weight primarily relies on clinical criteria, which are known for their poor diagnostic accuracy. Over the last three decades, there has been an intensive search for accurate and objective methods to evaluate dry weight and diagnose subclinical volume overload. Most methods have not been tested in appropriate clinical trials, and their usefulness in clinical practice remains uncertain, except for bioimpedance spectroscopy and lung ultrasound (US).

Bioimpedance spectroscopy is possibly the most widely used method for subjectively quantifying fluid distributions across body compartments, producing reliable and reproducible results. Lung US provides reliable estimates of extravascular water in the lung, a critical parameter of the central circulation that largely reflects the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. To maximize cardiovascular tolerance, fluid removal in volume-expanded HD patients should be gradual and distributed over a sufficiently long time window. This review summarizes knowledge about the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of volume overload in HD patients.

### Fluid overload as a therapeutic target for the preservative management of chronic kidney disease [^114A4Lqn]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Low credibility.

There is growing clinical evidence of adverse effects of fluid overload on kidney outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease who are not yet receiving kidney replacement therapy. In this review, we discuss the patient populations most at risk for fluid overload, the pathophysiology associated with fluid overload, and finally treatment options.

- **Recent findings**: The severity of fluid overload is an independent risk factor for both an increased risk of rapidly declining kidney function and increased risk for the need of kidney replacement therapy. High venous pressure within the kidney secondarily causes a decrease in kidney perfusion, which in turn signals salt retention, and the resulting increase in plasma volume completes a vicious cycle propagating ongoing kidney injury. Fluid overload has also been identified as a risk factor for the combined outcome of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity. This increased risk in some studies has been identified as more important than hypertension in predicting both the increased risk of kidney disease progression and morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease. Once fluid status is accurately assessed, a combination of salt restriction and effective diuretic therapy is the first-line therapy to manage this complication. In those patients who require additional therapy, use of V2 receptor antagonists can be considered. Finally, some patients may benefit from peritoneal dialysis to bring about volume removal even if they do not yet require dialysis for uremic complications.

Excess fluid overload as a therapeutic target necessitates accurate assessment and targeted interventions to mitigate the risk of kidney and cardiovascular complications.

### Dialysis for chronic kidney failure: A review [^116mWRLn]. JAMA (2024). High credibility.

More than 3.5 million people worldwide and 540,000 individuals in the US receive maintenance hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis for the treatment of chronic kidney failure. The 5-year survival rate is approximately 40% after the initiation of maintenance dialysis.

- **Observations**: Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis remove metabolic waste, excess body water, and rebalance electrolytes to sustain life. There is no recommended estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) threshold for initiating dialysis, and patient-clinician shared decision-making should help determine when to initiate dialysis. Persistent signs and symptoms of uremia (e.g. nausea, fatigue) and volume overload (e.g. dyspnea, peripheral edema), worsening eGFR, metabolic acidosis, and hyperkalemia inform the timing of therapy initiation. A randomized clinical trial reported no mortality benefit to starting dialysis at higher eGFR (10–14 mL/min/1.73 m²) versus lower eGFR (5–7 mL/min/1.73 m²) levels. Observational data suggested no differences in 5-year mortality with the use of hemodialysis versus peritoneal dialysis. Cardiovascular complications (e.g. arrhythmias, cardiac arrest) and infection-related complications of maintenance dialysis are common. In the US, hemodialysis catheter-related bloodstream infections occur at a rate of 1.1 to 5.5 episodes per 1000 catheter-days and affect approximately 50% of patients within 6 months of catheter placement. Peritonitis occurs at a rate of 0.26 episodes per patient-year and affects about 30% of individuals in the first year of peritoneal dialysis therapy.

### Fluid overload in the ICU: Evaluation and management [^116nN6CH]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Fluid overload that is refractory to medical therapy necessitates the use of extracorporeal therapies, such as continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT), since critically ill patients often experience hemodynamic instability and/or multiple organ dysfunctions. Accurate management of fluid balance is crucial, with the ultimate goal of enhancing pulmonary gas exchange and organ perfusion while maintaining stable hemodynamic parameters. The optimal renal replacement therapy for patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) and fluid overload has yet to be definitively established, and debate continues in this area. The choice of the initial modality should be based on the availability of resources, local expertise, the individual needs of the patients, and, finally, the patient's hemodynamic status.

In patients with fluid overload, CRRT offers the benefit of slower fluid removal compared to intermittent hemodialysis (IHD), resulting in greater hemodynamic stability and improved fluid balance control. Other advantages of CRRT over IHD include:

- **Controlled solute concentration**: Slower control of solute concentration reduces large fluctuations and fluid shifts, which minimizes the risk of cerebral edema.
- **Flexibility**: Great flexibility in terms of treatment adjustment to the patient's needs at any time.
- **User-friendly operation**: CRRT can be performed with relatively simple and user-friendly machines.

Some large observational studies have suggested that CRRT is an independent predictor of renal recovery among survivors.

In the absence of definitive data to support the use of a particular type of renal replacement therapy, CRRT and IHD should be considered complementary therapies.

### Fluid overload in the ICU: Evaluation and management [^116GZr6X]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Fluid overload is frequently found in acute kidney injury patients in critical care units. Recent studies have shown the relationship of fluid overload with adverse outcomes; hence, the management and optimization of fluid balance become central components of the management of critically ill patients.

- **Discussion**: In critically ill patients, adequate fluid resuscitation is essential to restore cardiac output, systemic blood pressure, and renal perfusion. Achieving an appropriate level of volume management requires knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology, evaluation of volume status, selection of appropriate solutions for volume repletion, maintenance, and modulation of tissue perfusion.

Numerous recent studies have established a correlation between fluid overload and mortality in critically ill patients. Fluid overload recognition and assessment require accurate documentation of intakes and outputs; yet, there is a wide difference in how it is evaluated, reviewed, and utilized. Accurate volume status evaluation is essential for appropriate therapy since errors in volume evaluation can result in either a lack of essential treatment or unnecessary fluid administration, both of which are associated with increased mortality.

There are several methods to evaluate fluid status; however, most of the tests currently used are fairly inaccurate. Diuretics, especially loop diuretics, remain a valid therapeutic alternative. Fluid overload refractory to medical therapy requires the application of extracorporeal therapies in critically ill patients.

### Volume overload and adverse outcomes in chronic kidney disease: Clinical observational and animal studies [^114amVpR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasingly recognized as a public health problem worldwide. CKD substantially increases the risks of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is associated with considerable healthcare costs. There is convincing evidence that the development of ESRD and CVD could be delayed by a multidisciplinary approach that controls modifiable risk factors. We previously demonstrated that volume overload is common in CKD patients and is associated with anemia, hypertension, proteinuria, arterial stiffness, and inflammation, which are strong predictors of CKD progression and CVD events. Consequently, volume overload shows great promise as a potential modifiable risk factor.

Volume overload has been linked to increased morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis and in patients with acute kidney injury. However, the available evidence detailing the effects of volume overload in CKD patients does not use a valid technique for measuring the level of fluid status, and the values obtained cannot be compared directly with the values in the normal population. Few studies have been conducted to evaluate the association of volume overload with adverse outcomes in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD, and even fewer have been conducted using animal models.

We hypothesized that volume overload might contribute significantly to the development of adverse clinical outcomes in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD. In the present study, we examined the association between volume overload and renal and cardiovascular outcomes.

### Unfavorable effects of history of volume overload and late referral to a nephrologist on mortality in patients initiating dialysis: a multicenter prospective cohort study in Japan [^115nNAcK]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with CKD are prone to volume overload due to their poor ability to respond to the rapid uptake of sodium, even before the onset of ESRD. Recent studies have shown that volume overload, whether determined clinically or using the bioelectric impedance method, is associated with a rapid decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and increased mortality risk in advanced CKD patients. If advanced CKD patients with volume overload experience delayed referral to a nephrologist, the preparation period before initiating dialysis may be shorter than expected.

However, in a prior study of patients with stage 3–5 CKD using the bioimpedance method, only about half were euvolemic, and about 20% of patients with volume overload had no clinically detectable edema. Therefore, even the past clinical history of volume overload during the progression of CKD to ESRD may suggest a potential predisposition to volume overload. To our knowledge, few studies have evaluated how the association between late referral and history of volume overload affects mortality in patients initiating dialysis. Additionally, large prospective studies that evaluate the relationship between the effects of late referral and multiple clinical complications associated with CVD are lacking.

In the present study, we evaluated the effects and the relationships between late referral and clinical history of volume overload on all-cause mortality and CVD-related mortality among patients newly initiated to dialysis. These patients were registered with the multicenter prospective study, the Aichi Cohort Study.

### Volume overload and adverse outcomes in chronic kidney disease: Clinical observational and animal studies [^111E9yx9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

The baseline characteristics of the patients, divided based on the absence or presence of volume overload, are presented. During a median follow-up of 2.1 years, 78 patients in the volume-overload group (44.6%) reached the primary endpoint compared with 22 in the euvolemia group (13.5%). Additionally, 71 patients (21%) progressed to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) needing chronic dialysis. The decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients with volume overload was significantly faster than those without volume overload (eGFR slope: −4.3 [−12.6, 1.2] versus −1.7 [−7.8, 2.7] mL/min per 1.73 m² per year, respectively; P < 0.05).

Kaplan–Meier survival analysis showed a significantly higher chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression or ESRD in patients with volume overload (P < 0.001 by the log-rank test). In the multivariable regression analysis, patients with volume overload had greater than double the risk of the composite endpoint (adjusted HR 2.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.45 to 4.13; P = 0.001). To further elucidate the contribution of elevated over-hydration (OH) levels, we performed multivariable Cox analyses with OH as a continuous variable. These analyses confirmed an increased risk of the composite endpoint (adjusted HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.42; P < 0.001) for every 1-L increase in OH.

### Changes in pulmonary restrictive parameters by intensive home hemodialysis: A case report [^117DJRT1]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) are at an increased risk for restrictive lung disease due to the accumulation of uremic toxins and volume overload. Hemodialysis is the preferred treatment for improving lung function in dialysis patients. However, the effects of fluid removal and solute clearance by hemodialysis on lung function remain unclear.

- **Case presentation**: We report a case of restrictive lung disorder in a hemodialysis patient, who showed improvement in both clinical and spirometric lung function after initiation of intensive home hemodialysis (32 hours per week).

- **Conclusion**: Intensive hemodialysis augments fluid removal and solute clearance, which in turn may improve restrictive lung function.

### Dose of dialysis in acute renal failure [^114uWynQ]. Seminars in Dialysis (2004). Low credibility.

Acute renal failure (ARF) is a cause of significant morbidity and mortality. Despite advances in supportive care, outcomes in ARF have improved little over the past decades. The primary goals in the management of patients with ARF are to optimize hemodynamic and volume status, minimize further renal injury, correct metabolic abnormalities, and permit adequate nutrition. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) is often required to achieve these goals while awaiting renal recovery, but the optimal dose of dialysis in patients with ARF is not known.

Extrapolation of the required dialysis dose from recommendations in chronic dialysis is unlikely to be appropriate due to the lack of a steady state and differences in the distribution volume of urea that are intrinsic to ARF. The prescribed dialysis dose in ARF is often low, and the actual delivered dose is often even less than prescribed. Delivery of dialysis in ARF is often hampered by the patient's hypercatabolic state, hemodynamic instability, and volume status, as well as suboptimal vascular access with temporary venous catheters.

The impact of intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) versus continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) on outcomes in ARF is also not clear. Patient disease severity impacts outcomes more than dialysis modality, but when patients are stratified for equal disease severity, CRRT may have potential benefits over IHD in terms of patient survival, fluid and metabolic control, and renal recovery. Strategies associated with improved outcomes that have emerged thus far in ARF are to aim for a time-averaged blood urea nitrogen level.

### Continuous renal replacement therapy is associated with less chronic renal failure than intermittent haemodialysis after acute renal failure [^111ETXGD]. Intensive Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Acute renal failure can be treated with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) or intermittent haemodialysis (IHD). Whether this choice affects renal recovery has been debated, since it has implications on quality of life and costs. Our objective was to determine the impact of CRRT and IHD on renal recovery.

- **Design**: Nationwide retrospective cohort study between the years 1995 and 2004 with follow-up ranging between 3 months and 10 years.

- **Setting**: Thirty-two Swedish intensive care units.

- **Patients and participants**: Eligible subjects were adults treated in Swedish general intensive care units with RRT. A total of 2,642 patients from 32 ICUs were included. We then excluded patients with end-stage renal disease (252) and patients lacking a diagnosis in the in-patient register (188). Thus, 2,202 patients were studied. Follow-up was complete.

- **Interventions**: None.

- **Measurements and results**: The primary outcome was renal recovery. Secondarily, we studied the mortality of the cohort. There were no differences between IHD and CRRT patients regarding baseline characteristics, such as age, sex, and comorbidities. Of the 1,102 patients surviving 90 days after inclusion in the cohort, 944 (85.7%) were treated with CRRT and 158 (14.3%) were treated with IHD. Seventy-eight patients (8.3%; confidence interval, CI, 6.6–10.2) never recovered their renal function in the CRRT group. The proportion was significantly higher among IHD patients, where 26 subjects or 16.5% (CI 11.0–23.2) developed a need for chronic dialysis.

Conclusions

Use of CRRT is associated with better renal recovery outcomes compared to IHD.

### Diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications of brain natriuretic peptide in dialysis and nondialysis-dependent chronic renal failure [^111EG6UV]. Seminars in Dialysis (2007). Low credibility.

Premature cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with end-stage renal failure. Natriuretic peptides, specifically brain natriuretic peptide, are released from the heart in response to chamber distension and thus increased in the presence of volume expansion and cardiac overload. Their physiological role is to cause vasodilatation and promote natriuresis to maintain volume homeostasis. Increasingly, serum levels of brain natriuretic peptide are used to both diagnose and manage cardiovascular disorders. Furthermore, augmenting the beneficial hemodynamic actions of brain natriuretic peptide may have a therapeutic role in decompensated heart failure.

However, the diagnostic role of serum brain natriuretic peptide levels in patients with advanced renal dysfunction remains to be defined. These patients have a high prevalence of left ventricular disorders, specifically left ventricular hypertrophy, which may reduce the diagnostic utility of brain natriuretic peptide. In addition, ventricular stretch may be determined by intravascular volume status rather than by cardiac dysfunction. Nonetheless, as the prognosis of patients with end-stage renal failure and co-existing heart failure is so poor, the availability of a further marker of cardiac "distress" may in the future become a useful diagnostic tool and, in due course, may become a primary goal for titration and tailoring of therapy.

### End-stage renal disease in 2010: Timing of dialysis initiation and choice of dialysis modality [^112wtUYu]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Few, if any, doubt that renal transplantation should be the first choice of renal replacement therapy whenever this option is possible. But, at which level of remaining kidney function should patients start on dialysis, and which dialysis modality should be used? Several studies published in 2010 addressed these questions and will influence dialysis initiation strategies worldwide for years to come.

### Update of dialysis initiation timing in end stage kidney disease patients: Is it a resolved question? A systematic literature review [^1151kkHL]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Low credibility.

**Mortality**: Four studies showed that patients with an optimal start of renal replacement therapy, or those who started dialysis at higher eGFR levels, have better survival. Martínez et al. observed that these patients with an optimal start of dialysis (haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) have greater survival than those who had a non-optimal start. The optimal start was defined when all the following criteria were met: a planned dialysis start, a minimum of 6-month follow-up by a nephrologist, and a first dialysis method coinciding with the one registered at 90 days. This result remained present and did not change materially after adjustment for sex, age, primary renal disease, and dialysis modality [HRCrude = 0.635 (95% CI 0.598–0.674), P < 0.001 versus HRAdj = 0.669 (95% CI 0.628–0.712), P < 0.001]. Matthew et al. also found that patients initiating dialysis therapy due to volume overload may have an increased risk for mortality compared with patients initiating routine dialysis due to laboratory evidence of kidney function decline. Adjusting for demographic variables, coexisting illnesses, and estimated glomerular filtration rate, initiation of dialysis therapy for volume overload or hypertension was associated with 1.69 (95% CI, 1.02–2.80) times higher risk for subsequent mortality compared to initiation for laboratory evidence of kidney function decline.

### Effects of fluid overload on heart rate variability in chronic kidney disease patients on hemodialysis [^114JMUgN]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are known to have a higher risk of mortality compared to the healthy population. Cardiovascular events are a major cause of this high mortality, with more than 40% of all patients with ESRD dying of cardiac causes. Fluid overload (FO) is common in patients on maintenance hemodialysis (HD), and it can lead to hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and cardiac mortality. Although the genesis of LVH is multifactorial, hypertension and FO are prominent factors of particular relevance for patients on HD. An abnormal hydration state has been related not only to LVH and hypertension but also to dialysis-related hypotension, pulmonary and peripheral edema, heart failure, and other adverse cardiovascular events. Moreover, FO has been highlighted as a key independent predictor of mortality in patients on HD.

Alterations in the autonomic nervous system (ANS) are also associated with cardiovascular death, such as autonomic neuropathy in patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Sympathetic overactivity and parasympathetic blunting have been observed in patients with CKD and ESRD. This sympatho-vagal imbalance contributes to the increased risk of cardiac death in these populations. Heart rate variability (HRV), which reflects the ability of the sinoatrial node to change heart rate in response to sympathetic and parasympathetic inputs, is a valuable tool for assessing heart rate control and also allows quantification of autonomic activity. For instance, the spectral decomposition of HRV signals has been proven to provide valuable insights.

### Why is your patient still short of breath? Understanding the complex pathophysiology of dyspnea in chronic kidney disease [^111XcXbQ]. Seminars in Dialysis (2017). Low credibility.

Dyspnea is one of the most common symptoms associated with CKD and significantly influences the quality of life of these patients. Its underlying causes are often associated with a negative prognosis, yet its pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Although hemodialysis may address fluid overload, it frequently fails to significantly alleviate breathlessness, suggesting the presence of multiple co-existing issues. This article aims to discuss the main pathophysiologic mechanisms and the most important putative etiologies underlying dyspnea in CKD patients.

- **Congestive heart failure and unrecognized chronic lung disease**: These are potential frequent causes of breathing disorders in this population, alongside pulmonary hypertension, lung fibrosis, air microembolism, dialyzer bio-incompatibility, anemia, sodium, and fluid overload. However, the relative contributions of these causes in any given patient are poorly understood.

- **Systemic inflammation**: A common factor that contributes to the development of endothelial dysfunction, lung fibrosis, anemia, malnutrition, and muscle wasting.

The introduction of novel multimodal imaging techniques, including pulmonary functional magnetic resonance imaging with inhaled contrast agents, could provide new insights into the pathophysiology of dyspnea in CKD patients. Ultimately, this could contribute to improving our clinical management of this symptom.

### On-line hemodiafiltration therapy for end-stage kidney disease patients: Promises for the future? What's next [^111cPAUy]. Seminars in Dialysis (2022). High credibility.

OL-HDF remains a tool that has already brought advances in blood purification and offers a paradigm shift in renal replacement therapy for patients with end-stage kidney failure. Renal replacement therapy for patients with chronic kidney disease has been a long journey that started some 60 years ago, with improvements over time in its various components — such as buffer, membrane flux, treatment time, dialysate composition purity, and HD machine options — supported by new clinical and biological findings. This continuous journey will not stop with OL-HDF.

Further developments are expected to arise from more personalized treatment schedules (incremental, daily, nocturnal, and alternate day), and from dialyzers offering additional clearance of uremic toxins, particularly modifications to remove protein-bound uremic toxins (adsorption and displacement). Innovations may also come from new dialysis machine functionality (biosensor, feedback loop control, and smart algorithms) or from integrating dialysis machines into a web-based network system, which can facilitate remote monitoring, control, and provide support for clinical decision-making.

Success in renal replacement therapy is not a destination but rather a journey, in which OL-HDF represents a major step forward designed to improve patient perceptions and outcomes.

### Modern tools for optimizing fluid management in dialysis patients: a comprehensive review [^115fjKWG]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in patients with ESRD on dialysis. Fluid overload contributes to hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, and increased mortality in this population. Conversely, excessive ultrafiltration can lead to intradialytic hypotension, myocardial stunning, and a decline in residual renal function. Accurate fluid status assessment and careful ultrafiltration management are crucial for optimal care of patients on dialysis.

Volume overload is an excess of extracellular fluid beyond the body's homeostatic capacity, manifesting as increased total body water leading to venous and pulmonary congestion. Traditionally, nephrologists have relied on clinical parameters such as blood pressure, physical examination findings, and changes in body weight to evaluate the patient's volume status. However, these methods have limitations and can often be misleading. Findings such as edema and pulmonary rales have poor sensitivity and specificity for detecting volume overload in dialysis patients. Chest X-ray, another commonly used tool, can only detect pulmonary edema when a significant degree of volume overload is already present. Even the use of dry weight, a fundamental concept in dialysis management, has its limitations.

There is a need for more objective ways to assess volume status. This review focuses on emerging techniques that enable direct visualization of organ congestion or objective measurement of fluid status, complementing established methods like relative blood volume monitoring and biomarkers.
