can be seen with chronic microvascular ischemia versus migraine
headaches.
what does this mean, briefly

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what this MRI report finding means — "few scattered foci of white matter FLAIR signal hyperintensity… can be seen with chronic microvascular ischemia versus migraine headaches" — and how to interpret the differential and its clinical significance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what FLAIR white matter hyperintensities (WMH) represent pathologically and how common they are. Then, I should verify the two leading etiologies listed by the radiologist — chronic small vessel ischemic change and migraine — and assess how clinical context shifts the likelihood. Next, I will examine imaging distribution patterns that sometimes hint at one cause over another, while remembering they overlap substantially. Finally, I should consider clinical implications, risk modification, follow-up, and red flags that would prompt alternative workup such as demyelination or genetic small-vessel disease like CADASIL, before synthesizing a clear, patient-centered interpretation with appropriate counseling and next steps.

> Let me first confirm the terminology: "few scattered foci of white matter FLAIR hyperintensity" means there are small, punctate bright spots in the cerebral white matter on FLAIR sequences; pathologically these reflect increased water content and, when nonspecific, most often represent microvascular change or benign migraine-associated spots depending on age and risk profile, though they can arise from varied processes [^114fmmdP] [^111KsErQ].

> I need to check the first branch of the differential — chronic microvascular ischemia, also referred to as cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). This is very common with aging and vascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and smoking, and its neuroimaging hallmarks include WMH, lacunes, enlarged perivascular spaces, and sometimes microbleeds; importantly, WMH burden from SVD tracks with increased risks of stroke and cognitive decline, so it is a validated marker of cerebrovascular burden rather than a diagnosis in and of itself [^112Ttovb] [^114fmmdP] [^112B1uTx].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; the second branch — migraine — also carries an association with WMH, particularly in patients with aura and with higher attack frequency, though results across population-based and clinic studies are mixed and sometimes attenuate after adjustment for vascular risks, suggesting heterogeneity of mechanisms and populations studied [^114xq6Wj] [^111KsErQ] [^111yuuA7].

> Wait, let me verify the nature of that uncertainty. Several studies and meta-analyses conflict on whether migraine independently increases WMH burden or infarct-like lesions once vascular risk factors are accounted for, with some showing increased deep frontal punctate WMH in migraine and others finding no difference; this means imaging cannot reliably distinguish "migraine WMH" from "ischemic WMH" on appearance alone, especially when lesions are few and small [^112V87mQ] [^111yuuA7] [^112wamse].

> Let me consider clinical significance next. With wording like "few scattered", the lesion burden is generally low and often incidental and asymptomatic, but context matters; in older adults or those with vascular risks, even a small WMH burden may reflect early SVD with prognostic import for stroke and cognitive outcomes, whereas in younger migraine patients without vascular risk factors, these are often considered benign variants with limited long-term cognitive consequences in longitudinal data [^114fmmdP] [^113U1WKD] [^114dZPAx].

> I should double-check pathophysiology signals that help frame the SVD side of the differential. Deep watershed white matter is vulnerable to chronic hypoperfusion with compensatory increases in oxygen extraction fraction around WMH, supporting a hypoxic-ischemic mechanism in sporadic SVD; this reinforces the clinical priority to optimize blood pressure and other risks if SVD is suspected based on age and risk profile [^1112M6g1] [^115GQ4dQ].

> Next, I should review imaging patterns that sometimes guide probability, keeping the caveat that overlap is substantial. Migraine-associated WMH are frequently small, punctate, and often frontal or deep rather than confluent periventricular, while SVD-related WMH more often accumulate periventricularly and progress toward confluence with increasing burden; however, with only "few scattered" lesions, pattern-based attribution is unreliable and should not override clinical context [^112wamse] [^112515gQ] [^114fmmdP].

> But wait, what if the lesions aren't vascular at all — do I need to check for demyelinating disease or genetic SVD mimics. Let me verify: migraine patients with numerous WMH generally do not show MRI-visible cortical demyelinating lesions on double inversion recovery, which helps argue against multiple sclerosis when the clinical picture is not suggestive; however, incidentally detected demyelinating-appearing lesions (radiologically isolated syndrome) do occur and warrant careful clinicoradiologic correlation when morphology and distribution fit, while early-onset WMH with migraine with aura, a strong family history of early stroke, and anterior temporal or external capsule involvement should prompt consideration of CADASIL and targeted evaluation [^115F5dRs] [^112Ttovb] [^1143JhwT].

> I need to ensure the management advice aligns with both possibilities. There is no lesion-directed treatment for scattered WMH; rather, counsel on vascular risk optimization if SVD is plausible (tight blood pressure control, diabetes and lipid management, smoking cessation, physical activity), and treat migraine per guideline-based strategies for attack and prevention as appropriate; routine repeat MRI is not generally required for stable, typical migraine with a normal neurologic examination, but new focal neurologic deficits, stepwise decline, or atypical headache red flags justify re-imaging or further workup [^115GQ4dQ] [^112B1uTx] [^112Ts7gN].

> Hold on, I should verify red flags that would change my threshold for further testing. Consider additional evaluation when WMH are disproportionately heavy for age, when there are lacunes, microbleeds, or characteristic anterior temporal/external capsule involvement suggesting CADASIL, when there are demyelination-typical lesions or oligoclonal bands suggesting multiple sclerosis, or when systemic features raise concern for vasculitis; in these scenarios, targeted labs, advanced MRI sequences, and sometimes genetic testing or CSF analysis are appropriate next steps [^1143JhwT] [^115GQ4dQ] [^112515gQ].

> In brief, I should synthesize this clearly: the phrase means the MRI shows a small number of nonspecific white matter spots that, in most adults, are either tiny ischemic changes from small vessel disease related to vascular risks or benign migraine-associated lesions; because imaging appearances overlap, the deciding factors are age, vascular risk profile, migraine phenotype and frequency, and the overall WMH burden, and for "few scattered" lesions, the usual course is conservative management focused on vascular risk optimization and migraine care rather than specific treatment of the spots themselves [^114fmmdP] [^114xq6Wj] [^112B1uTx].

This MRI phrase means there are **small, nonspecific white matter spots** [^114fmmdP] that are most often benign and linked to either **chronic microvascular ischemia** (from aging or vascular risk factors) [^112515gQ] or migraine [^111KsErQ]. They are common in older adults or migraine patients [^114fmmdP], **usually do not cause symptoms** [^114dZPAx], and rarely require further testing unless there are unusual neurological symptoms or rapid progression [^112Ts7gN]. Management focuses on **controlling vascular risk factors** [^115GQ4dQ] and **migraine care**.

## Comparison of WMH etiologies

| **Attribute** | **Chronic microvascular ischemia** | **Migraine headaches** |
|-|-|-|
| Clinical significance | Small vessel disease from hypertension, diabetes, or aging causes chronic hypoperfusion, demyelination, and axonal loss, appearing as WMHs on MRI [^1112M6g1] [^114fmmdP] [^112515gQ] | Migraine, especially with aura, is associated with small, punctate WMHs, likely from transient hypoperfusion or inflammatory processes during attacks [^111KsErQ] [^117XkQsm] [^116zk2pT] |
| Typical MRI appearance | Lesions are often periventricular or deep white matter [^114fmmdP], bilateral, symmetric, and confluent [^112515gQ] with higher burden in older adults or those with vascular risk factors [^115GQ4dQ] | Lesions are typically small, punctate, in subcortical or juxtacortical white matter [^111KsErQ], often frontal [^112V87mQ], and less confluent than ischemic lesions [^117XkQsm] |
| Clinical implications and management | Associated with cognitive decline, gait disturbance, and higher stroke risk [^114fmmdP]; management targets vascular risk factors (blood pressure, diabetes, cholesterol, smoking) [^115GQ4dQ] [^112B1uTx] | Lesions are usually benign and not linked to cognitive decline or stroke; management focuses on migraine control and patient reassurance |

## When to consider further evaluation

- Rapid progression of lesions [^113U1WKD]
- Presence of neurological symptoms (e.g. cognitive decline, motor deficits) [^115GQ4dQ]
- Atypical lesion appearance (e.g. large, confluent, or enhancing lesions) [^112Ttovb]

## Summary table: comparison of WMHs in chronic microvascular ischemia vs. migraine

| **Feature** | **Chronic microvascular ischemia** | **Migraine headaches** |
|-|-|-|
| Typical patient | Older adults; vascular risk factors [^115GQ4dQ] | Younger; migraine history [^114dZPAx] |
| Lesion location | Periventricular; deep white matter [^114fmmdP] | Subcortical; juxtacortical [^112V87mQ] |
| Lesion appearance | Confluent; symmetric [^114fmmdP] | Punctate; asymmetric [^111KsErQ] |
| Clinical significance | Cognitive decline; stroke risk [^114fmmdP] | Usually benign [^114dZPAx] |
| Management | Control vascular risk factors [^115GQ4dQ] | Migraine control; reassurance [^111KsErQ] |

## Conclusion

"Few scattered foci of white matter FLAIR signal hyperintensity" are **common, nonspecific MRI findings** [^114fmmdP], most often reflecting chronic microvascular ischemia or migraine [^112515gQ] [^111KsErQ]. They are **usually benign and asymptomatic** [^114dZPAx]; management should focus on controlling vascular risk factors or optimizing migraine care, with further evaluation reserved for atypical features or neurological symptoms [^115GQ4dQ] [^112Ts7gN].

### Migraine and risk of stroke [^111KsErQ]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

White matter hyperintensities are typically multiple, small punctate hyperintensities in deep or periventricular white matter, often seen on T2-weighted images (Figure 1). Several studies have found an increased risk of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) in people with migraines, with a higher risk in those experiencing more frequent and severe attacks. The relationship between WMH and the type of headache is uncertain, as some studies have found an increased risk of WMH in people with severe headaches (both migraine and non-migraine headache), while others have found an increased risk for women with any migraine, including migraine with aura (MA) and migraine without aura (MO). Some studies have found an increased risk for MA only. There are also studies that have failed to find any association between MA and WMH.

The presence of WMH is associated with several hemodynamic parameters, including increased central blood pressure, greater aortic stiffness, and decreased resistance in intracranial arteries. The impact of migraines on structural brain lesion progression over time is uncertain, as studies on this association show conflicting results. Although WMH have been associated with an increased risk of stroke, dementia, and death, results from longitudinal studies show no increased risk of cognitive decline in people with migraine (both MA and MO).

### Cerebral small vessel disease: Neuroimaging markers and clinical implication [^112515gQ]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is a broad category of cerebrovascular diseases primarily affecting the perforating arterioles, capillaries, and venules, with multiple distinct etiologies. Despite the distinct pathogenesis, CSVD shares similar neuroimaging markers, including recent small subcortical infarcts, lacunes of presumed vascular origin, white matter hyperintensities of presumed vascular origin, perivascular spaces, and cerebral microbleeds. The radiological features of neuroimaging markers are indicative for etiological analysis.

Furthermore, in cases of sporadic arteriosclerotic pathogenesis-associated CSVD, the total CSVD burden is a significant predictor for stroke events, global cognitive impairment, psychiatric disorders, and later quality of life. This review aims to summarize the radiological characteristics and the clinical implications of CSVD markers, as well as neuroimaging interpretation for CSVD symptomatology.

### CNS small vessel disease: A clinical review [^115GQ4dQ]. Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

CNS small vessel disease (CSVD) causes 25% of strokes and contributes to 45% of dementia cases. Prevalence increases with age, affecting about 5% of people aged 50 years to almost 100% of people older than 90 years. Known causes and risk factors include age, hypertension, branch atheromatous disease, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, radiation exposure, immune-mediated vasculitides, certain infections, and several genetic diseases. CSVD can be asymptomatic; however, depending on location, lesions can cause mild cognitive dysfunction, dementia, mood disorders, motor and gait dysfunction, and urinary incontinence.

CSVD is diagnosed on the basis of brain imaging biomarkers, including recent small subcortical infarcts, white matter hyperintensities, lacunes, cerebral microbleeds, enlarged perivascular spaces, and cerebral atrophy. Advanced imaging modalities can detect signs of disease even earlier than standard imaging techniques. Diffusion tensor imaging can identify altered white matter connectivity, and blood oxygenation level-dependent imaging can identify decreased vascular reactivity.

Pathogenesis is thought to begin with an etiologically specific insult, with or without genetic predisposition, which results in dysfunction of the neurovascular unit. Uncertainties regarding pathogenesis have delayed the development of effective treatment. The most widely accepted approach to treatment is to intensively control well-established vascular risk factors, of which hypertension is the most important. With a better understanding of pathogenesis, specific therapies may emerge.

### Unanticipated demyelinating pathology of the CNS [^112Ttovb]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Incidentally identified anomalies within the CNS that are highly suggestive of demyelinating disease have been extensively described in neuropathological series and are increasingly being detected during premortem investigations. With the exception of studies specifically focusing on the prevalence of this entity, the observed anomalies are unanticipated and unrelated to the intended purpose of the examination. The discovery of MRI technology and its subsequent widespread adoption in the clinic have facilitated the identification of such cases. The natural course of individuals with incidentally identified demyelinating anomalies is unknown at present.

This review focuses on the history and nosology of unexpected demyelinating pathology, encompassing both autopsy data and MRI-based antemortem investigations of large cohorts, as well as family members at high risk of developing multiple sclerosis. Longitudinal clinical data acquired from prospectively followed cohorts are also reviewed. In addition, this discussion covers the estimated prevalence of demyelinating pathology, the currently proposed criteria for its identification, implications for therapeutic intervention, and predictors of disease progression.

### Microvascular pathology and morphometrics of sporadic and hereditary small vessel diseases of the brain [^114qvzSk]. Brain Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

Diffuse and focal white matter (WM) lesions are another prominent hallmark of SVD. Neuroimaging and pathological studies show that WM changes are invariably associated with cognitive abnormalities. WM alterations are much more profound in hereditary SVDs such as CADASIL and CARASIL. They may occur in the absence of lacunar infarcts, and extensive WM hyperintensities (WMH) appear associated with increased brain volume, particularly in CADASIL. In this disorder, WMH relate not only to loss of WM components but also to a global increase of water content in the cerebral tissue. WM hyperintensities on T2-weighted MRI or leukoaraiosis, as a decreased signal on CT, may not only incorporate WM rarefaction, incomplete infarction, lacunar strokes, perivascular spacing, and demyelination, but sometimes also axonal and Wallerian degeneration. Diffusion tensor imaging has demonstrated how tissue microstructural changes in WM tracts and subcortical regions, for example, putamen and thalamus, are related to worsening clinical outcomes in SVD and CADASIL. The widespread WM axonal changes, particularly in the frontal lobe, may arise from differential stenosis and sclerosis of arterioles, possibly affecting certain axon bundles connecting to targets in the subcortical structures, specifically degeneration of thalamocortical pathways causing cortical atrophy.

There is some controversy as to whether deep or periventricular lesions are of greater importance, but this depends on the definition of boundaries between the periventricular and deep WM.

### No association between migraine frequency, white matter lesions and silent brain infarctions: A study in a series of women with chronic migraine [^112V87mQ]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

It has been suggested that silent infarctions (SIs) and hyperintense white matter lesions (WMLs) are related to migraine frequency. We studied their prevalence and anatomical distribution in patients with chronic migraine (CM).

- **Methods**: A total of 96 women with CM [mean age 43 (range 16–65) years] and 29 women with episodic migraine (EM) [mean age 36 (range 16–58) years] underwent 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging following the CAMERA protocol. The number, size, and location of SIs and deep WMLs were recorded, and a modified Fazekas scale was applied to assess periventricular WMLs.

- **Results**: White matter lesions were found in 59 (61.5%) women with CM and 17 (58.6%) women with EM (odds ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence intervals, 0.48–2.62; P = 0.784). The majority (63% CM and 71% EM) were small deep WMLs. Exclusive periventricular WMLs were exceptional. Of the 739 WMLs seen in patients with CM, 734 (99.3%) were hemispheric and mostly frontal (81%). Posterior fossa WMLs were seen in only five (5.2%) women with CM (always in the pons) and two (6.9%) women with EM. Age > 45 years was the only vascular risk factor associated with a higher WML number (median: 0 45 years; P = 0.004). We found seven SIs in six women with CM (6.3%).

- **Conclusions**: As compared with the expected prevalence at this age, this study confirms that the prevalence of WMLs, in most cases small, deep, and frontal, was increased in CM and EM. However, our results do not support an association of WMLs or SIs with a higher frequency of attacks, but with the presence of vascular risk factors.

### Covert cerebral small vessel disease: Ready for clinical prime time [^112B1uTx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Covert cerebral small vessel disease is gaining considerable attention in clinical practice, emphasizing the need for early detection and management. This attention is crucial due to its potential impact on future cerebrovascular and cognitive outcomes. Continued research, including recent randomized controlled trials, has provided insight into the pathogenesis and potential therapeutic strategies for managing the disease. As our understanding deepens, clinicians may be better equipped to incorporate these findings into practice, improving patient care outcomes in the long term.

### Cerebral distribution of white matter lesions in migraine with aura patients [^112wamse]. Cephalalgia (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to compare the cerebral distribution of white matter lesions (WMLs) between migraine patients with different aura symptoms.

- **Methods**: Migraine with aura (MA) patients were consecutively enrolled as part of the Shunt-Associated Migraine (SAM) study. Aura was classified into motor, aphasic, sensory, visual, or vertebrobasilar categories based on clinical symptoms. Standard and FLAIR (fluid attenuated inversion recovery) T(2)-weighted MRI sequences were inspected for WMLs by three independent raters blinded to clinical data. WMLs were assessed in the periventricular areas (PV-WMLs) using the Fazekas scale and in the deep white matter (D-WMLs) with the Schelten's scale. Interobserver agreement was good to excellent (k = 0.64 to 0.96, p < .0001).

- **Results**: One hundred eighty-five patients (77% women) were included. Aura symptoms were classified as visual in 172 (99%) patients, sensory in 76 (42%), aphasic in 54 (30%), motor in 39 (21%), and vertebrobasilar in 17 (9%) patients. One hundred four patients (57%) exhibited more than one type of aura. D-WMLs were mainly detected in the frontal lobes (86%). There was no association between the type of aura and the presence of WMLs in any cerebral location.

- **Conclusion**: Aura symptoms do not influence the cerebral distribution of WMLs associated with migraine disease.

### Multiple subcortical acute ischemic lesions reflect small vessel disease rather than cardiogenic embolism [^1154LXtX]. Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Multiple acute ischemic lesions in different hemispheres or vascular territories are mainly considered to be of proximal embolic origin. However, despite careful diagnostic work-up, the etiological classification often remains undetermined. We propose that multiple acute ischemic lesions can sometimes be a phenomenon observed in small vessel disease (SVD).

From a prospectively collected database of more than 7,000 stroke patients, 173 patients with acute bihemispheric infarction were identified. We analyzed those subjects with multiple small (< 15 mm Ø) subcortical acute ischemic lesions on diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) and concomitant severe small vessel disease (Fazekas grades II-III) without a proximal embolic source as evaluated by cardiological investigations. Twenty patients (mean age 66 ± 12 years, 12 men) with a mean number of 2.95 ± 1.24 acute lesions on DWI (range of 2–7 lesions per patient) were identified (n = 5 Fazekas II°, n = 15 Fazekas III°).

Most of the lesions were located in typical areas of lacunar infarction. The mean NIHSS score on admission was 2.95 ± 2.0 (range 0–8). Multiple acute ischemic lesions in different vascular territories might not always be of proximal cardiovascular embolic origin. Simultaneous small subcortical ischemic lesions may reflect remote ischemia due to small vessel disease, suggesting simultaneous hemorheological dysfunction.

### New daily persistent headache: A lack of an association with white matter abnormalities on neuroimaging [^112NvL3i]. Cephalalgia (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to provide results from the largest study of new daily persistent headache patients at the time of writing and specifically evaluate if patients with primary new daily persistent headache develop white matter abnormalities or infarct-like lesions on neuroimaging.

Methods involved a retrospective analysis of patient medical records utilizing an electronic medical record system. All patients were seen at a headache specialty clinic by a single headache neurologist and diagnosed with primary new daily persistent headache during the period from January 2009 to January 2013.

Results showed that altogether, 97 patients were diagnosed with primary new daily persistent headache (65 women and 32 men). The mean average age of onset was slightly younger in women than men: 32.4 years vs. 35.8 years. In total, 84 of the 97 new daily persistent headache patients had no white matter abnormalities or infarct-like lesions on magnetic resonance imaging, with a gender distribution of 56 women and 28 men. The mean age of onset of this white matter negative subgroup was 31.1 years. Of these individuals, 36% had cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk factors, and 44% had a history of migraine. Only 13 new daily persistent headache patients (nine women, four men) demonstrated white matter abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging. None had infarct-like lesions. The mean age of onset of this white matter positive subgroup was 54.2 years, significantly older than the white matter negative population (p < 0.05). All new daily persistent headache patients in the white matter positive subgroup had cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk factors.

Image processing and categorisation of white matter hyperintensities

We analysed brain scans using previously validated automated imaging processing. Briefly, we used a three-step process: preprocessing, including registration, removal of non-brain tissue, and correction for bias field; detection of white matter hyperintensities on T2 weighted images, including removal of false positives; and post-processing, including the generation of probability maps for white matter hyperintensities and details. For each detected lesion, we computed the localization and volume. When the distance of the detected white matter hyperintensities to the ventricular system was less than 10 mm, we labelled the location of the lesions as periventricular; otherwise, we labelled the lesions as deep white matter hyperintensities. The algorithm correlated well with a semiquantitative visual rating carried out by a neuroradiologist (quadratic trend with Scheltens scale P < 0.001).

We log-transformed the measures for the volume of white matter hyperintensities, as they were not normally distributed. Next, we standardized the volume of white matter hyperintensities to the total volume of white matter. Standardization with total intracranial volume yielded similar results. Finally, we a priori categorised all measures for volume of white matter hyperintensities into tertiles to allow for non-linear patterns of association.

Assessment of infarct lesions

One neurologist with training in neuroradiology (YCZ), who was blinded to the headache status and any other clinical data of participants, used a standardized method to evaluate infarcts.

### Prevalence and significance of the vessel-cluster sign on susceptibility-weighted imaging in patients with severe small vessel disease [^11623zbo]. Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

A total of 94 vessel-clusters were identified among 36 patients. Forty-eight of the 94 vessel-clusters (51%) were located in the left hemisphere, 22 of 94 (23%) were located in the anterior, 55 (58.5%) in the middle, and 17 (18%) in the posterior deep white matter. The median (IQR) volume of the region containing the vessel-cluster was 0.15 mL (0.08–0.26), which had a round shape in 45 (48%) vessel-clusters, ovoid in 32 (34%), irregular in 6 (6%), and linear in 11 (12%).

Among the 94 vessel-clusters, 27 of them showed clustered or linked low-signal dots or lines that seem to correspond to one main vessel-like structure (29%), while clusters of multiple vessel-like structures (up to 5) were observed in the remaining 67 (71%), with a median of 2 (1–3) vessel-like structures per vessel-cluster. Examples are shown in Figure 1 and eFigure 5. An example of the traceability of vessel-like structures on SWI and MIP through contiguous axial planes is shown in Figure 4.

Twelve vessel-clusters (13%) corresponded to noncavitated WMH, 45 (48%) to partial cavitation in WMH, and 37 (40%) to complete cavities. Vessel-clusters of multiple vessels covered a larger volume than single–vessel-like structures (median [IQR] volume [mL]: 0.17 [0.98–0.30] vs 0.09 [0.5–0.20], respectively, p = 0.005). They were more likely to be associated with completely cavitated lesions (n, 33 [49%] vs 4 [15], p = 0.002) and more likely to appear as a linear rim (n, 37 [44%] vs 4 [15], p < 0.001), but with no difference in location in the white matter (p = 0.186).

### Oxygen metabolic stress and white matter injury in patients with cerebral small vessel disease [^1112M6g1]. Stroke (2022). High credibility.

Chronic hypoxia-ischemia is a putative mechanism underlying the development of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and microstructural disruption in cerebral small vessel disease. WMH fall primarily within deep white matter (WM) watershed regions. We hypothesized that elevated oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), a signature of hypoxia-ischemia, would be detected in the watershed where WMH density is highest. We further hypothesized that OEF would be elevated in regions immediately surrounding WMH, at the leading edge of growth.

- **Methods**: In this cross-sectional study conducted from 2016 to 2019 at an academic medical center in St. Louis, MO, participants (age > 50) with a range of cerebrovascular risk factors underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging using pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling, asymmetric spin echo, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and diffusion tensor imaging to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF), OEF, WMH, and WM integrity, respectively. We defined the physiologic watershed as a region where CBF was below the 10th percentile of mean WM CBF in a young healthy cohort. We conducted linear regression to evaluate the relationship between CBF and OEF with structural and microstructural WM injury defined by fluid-attenuated inversion recovery WMH and diffusion tensor imaging, respectively. We conducted ANOVA to determine if OEF was increased in proximity to WMH lesions.

- **Results**: In a cohort of 42 participants (age 50–80), the physiologic watershed region spatially overlapped with regions of highest WMH lesion density. As CBF decreased and OEF increased, the subtle changes in white matter injury became apparent and correlated with hypoxic stress factors.

### Migraine, white matter hyperintensities, and subclinical brain infarction in a diverse community: The northern Manhattan study [^115SU4ZA]. Stroke (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to examine the association between migraine and subclinical cerebrovascular damage in a racially and ethnically diverse, older population-based cohort.

- **Methods**: In the Northern Manhattan Study (NOMAS), subclinical brain infarctions and white matter hyperintensity volumes were quantified among participants with self-reported migraine, confirmed by the International Classification of Headache Disorders-2 criteria.

- **Results**: Among 546 study participants with imaging and migraine data (41% men; mean age at MRI, 71 ± 8 years; mostly Hispanic [65%]), individuals reporting migraine had double the odds of subclinical brain infarction (adjusted odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.0–4.2) compared to those reporting no migraine, after adjusting for sociodemographic and vascular risk factors. No association was found between migraine, with or without aura, and white matter hyperintensity volume.

- **Conclusions**: Migraine may be a risk factor for subclinical brain infarction. Prospective studies are needed, particularly in racially and ethnically diverse populations.

### Positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging findings in the diagnosis of stroke-like migraine attacks after radiation therapy syndrome: A case report [^115Ajudz]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2024). Low credibility.

Concurrently performed FDG PET/MRI demonstrated markedly increased FDG avidity corresponding to the area of gyriform enhancement visualized on MRI, with a standardized uptake value (SUV) of 31.6 in the area of focal avidity compared to an SUV of 16.7 in the normal-appearing right frontal cortex and an SUV of 5.2 in normal-appearing right parietal white matter (Fig. 3). Thus, the pattern of intense FDG avidity followed the characteristic gyriform enhancement pattern visualized on MRI.

- **Figure 3**: 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) findings 1 month after symptomatic presentation. PET windowed to 0 to 15. Axial view of (a) T1 postcontrast and (b) fused FDG PET and magnetic resonance imaging obtained at 1 month after the initial emergency department presentation. FDG PET demonstrates gyriform intense avidity with a standardized uptake value of 31.6 corresponding to the area of left frontal cortical enhancement. This is further illustrated on coronal views demonstrating gyriform enhancement along the left frontal cortex which was also observed in the coronal view on (c) T1 postcontrast imaging and (d) fused PET/magnetic resonance imaging windowed to a standardized uptake value of 0 to 15.

Overall, the gyriform left frontal enhancement with corresponding T2 hyperintensity and intense FDG avidity in the clinical setting of seizure-like presentation, with a prior history of radiation therapy, favored the diagnosis of SMART syndrome. Management included active MRI surveillance with brain biopsy deferred pending imaging results.

### Strategic role of frontal white matter tracts in vascular cognitive impairment: A voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping study in CADASIL [^117N6HXL]. Brain (2011). Low credibility.

Cerebral small vessel disease is the most common cause of vascular cognitive impairment, typically manifesting with lacunar infarcts and ischemic white matter lesions. However, the relationship between these lesions and cognitive symptoms is not well understood. Previous studies have identified a poor correlation between the burden of ischemic lesions and cognitive symptoms, leaving much of the variance in cognitive performance unexplained.

The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between the location of subcortical ischemic lesions and cognitive symptoms in small vessel disease. We applied a voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping approach using data from 215 CADASIL patients, a genetically defined small vessel disease with mutations in the NOTCH3 gene. All participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging and comprehensive neuropsychological testing. Lacunar lesions and white matter lesions were segmented on three-dimensional T1 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences, respectively.

A total of 145 subjects had 854 lacunar lesions, ranging from 1 to 13 per individual. The normalized volume of white matter hyperintensities ranged from 0.0425% to 21.5% of the intracranial cavity. Significant clusters for cognitive performance were detected in both lacunar lesions and white matter hyperintensities. The most prominent results were observed with a compound score for processing speed, the predominantly affected cognitive domain in this group of patients. Strategic locations included the anterior parts of the thalamus, the genu, and other regions relevant to cognitive function.

### Migraine as a risk factor for subclinical brain lesions [^114UcdLy]. JAMA (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical series have suggested an increased prevalence of cerebral infarction and white matter lesions (WMLs) in migraine patients. It is not known whether these lesions are prevalent in the general migraine population.

- **Objectives**: To compare the prevalence of brain infarcts and WMLs in migraine cases and controls from the general population, and to identify migraine characteristics associated with these lesions.

- **Design**: Cross-sectional, prevalence study of a population-based sample of Dutch adults aged 30 to 60 years.

- **Participants**: Randomly selected patients with migraine with aura (n = 161), patients with migraine without aura (n = 134), and controls (n = 140), who were frequency matched to cases for age, sex, and place of residence. Nearly 50% of the cases had not been previously diagnosed by a physician.

- **Main outcome measures**: Brain magnetic resonance images were evaluated for infarcts, by location and vascular supply territory, and for periventricular WMLs (PVWMLs) and deep WMLs (DWMLs). The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of these brain lesions compared with controls were examined by migraine subtype (with or without aura) and monthly attack frequency (≥ 1 attack), controlling for cardiovascular risk factors and use of vasoconstrictor migraine agents. All participants underwent a standard neurological examination.

Results showed that no participants reported a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, nor had relevant abnormalities at a standard neurological examination. We found no significant difference between patients with migraine and controls in the prevalence of brain infarcts or WMLs.

### Progression of cerebral white matter lesions — clinical and radiological considerations [^113U1WKD]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2007). Low credibility.

More than half of all elderly individuals have some degree of white matter lesions (WML) on MRI of the brain. Until recently, the rate of progression of WML was unknown. Recent work within several population-based large-scale studies has been devoted to tackling this question, identifying factors related to WML progression, and establishing a relationship with clinical variables and cognitive changes. There is converging evidence that at least a subset of WML demonstrates considerable progression over time. Increases in WML volume have been correlated with a greater loss of brain volume and a decline in cognitive and motor performance, indicating that progression of WML holds clinical relevance.

Correlative MRI-histopathologic studies and the clustering of vascular risk factors in subjects with progressive WML support a vascular etiology of WML, particularly in "confluent" MRI phenotypes. Although specific rating scales have been proposed to detect WML progression, quantitative measurements appear superior given their objective and reproducible nature and their advantages regarding statistical analyses. Measuring changes in the progression of WML may provide a valid surrogate marker in future clinical trials on cerebral small-vessel disease. Power calculations based on quantitative data from the Austrian Stroke Prevention Study (ASPS) suggest that such studies would be feasible.

### Brain lesions and cerebral functional impairment in migraine patients [^114dZPAx]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2009). High credibility.

Migraine is an independent risk factor for ischemic stroke, mainly in the subpopulation of women with migraine with aura who are younger than 45 years, particularly those that use estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. Migraine, however, should be considered a benign condition as the absolute increase in stroke risk is small. Migraine is also associated with a high prevalence of cerebral white matter hyperintensities, occurring in the deep and periventricular white matter, as well as infratentorial areas, mainly pontine. The pathogenesis and clinical significance of these hyperintensities are unclear.

We do not know whether migraine may be considered a progressive disorder in a subset of patients because of the accumulation of these hyperintensities over time. Studies on the relationship between migraine and cognitive functioning yielded conflicting results. Two recent studies have provided reassuring news for the migraine patient:

- **Population-based twin study**: A lifetime migraine diagnosis was not associated with cognitive deficits in middle-aged subjects.
- **Long-term prospective study**: This study assessed cognitive and memory changes in aging individuals with and without a history of migraine and showed that migraineurs do not exhibit more decline on cognitive tests over time compared to controls.

Migraine is certainly not a recognized risk factor for (vascular) dementia.

### Headache, migraine, and structural brain lesions and function: Population based epidemiology of vascular ageing-MRI study [^114xq6Wj]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the association of overall and specific headaches with the volume of white matter hyperintensities, brain infarcts, and cognition.

- **Design**: Population-based, cross-sectional study.
- **Setting**: Epidemiology of Vascular Ageing study, Nantes, France.
- **Participants**: 780 participants (mean age 69, 58.5% women) with detailed headache assessment.
- **Main outcome measures**: Brain scans were evaluated for the volume of white matter hyperintensities (by fully automated imaging processing) and for the classification of infarcts (by visual reading with a standardized assessment grid). Cognitive function was assessed by a battery of tests, including the mini-mental state examination.

Results showed that 163 (20.9%) participants reported a history of severe headache, and 116 had migraines, of whom 17 (14.7%) reported aura symptoms. An association was found between any history of severe headache and increasing volume of white matter hyperintensities. The adjusted odds ratio of being in the highest third for total volume of white matter hyperintensities was 2.0 (95% confidence interval 1.3 to 3.1, P for trend 0.002) for participants with any history of severe headache when compared with participants without severe headache being in the lowest third. The association pattern was similar for all headache types. Migraine with aura was the only headache type strongly associated with deep white matter hyperintensities (highest third odds ratio 12.4, 1.6 to 99.4, P for trend 0.005) and with brain infarcts (3.4, 1.2 to 9.3). The location of infarcts was predominantly outside the cerebellum and brain regions.

### Lipoprotein-a and white matter abnormalities: predicting small vessel disease in young patients with ischemic cerebrovascular events [^111xGUbu]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Periventricular WMH were classified as follows: (a) normal — no detectable hyperintensities; (b) mild — presence of "caps" or a pencil-thin lining; (c) moderate — a smooth "halo" surrounding the ventricles; and (d) severe — irregular hyperintensities extending from the periventricular zone into adjacent deep white matter.

Deep WMH were rated as: (a) normal — absence of hyperintense lesions; (b) mild — isolated punctate foci; (c) moderate — early confluence of lesions; and (d) severe — large confluent areas of hyperintensity.

Because of the paucity of patients with periventricular WMH, in line with previous findings, we established a cutoff of Fazekas scale over 2 to address a significant burden of WMH (mostly in deep locations). This is a consequence of the inclusion criteria based on patients under the age of 65.

Anonymized patient data were included in the statistical analysis. Results are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) for normally distributed data, or median and interquartile range (IQR) for skewed data. For group comparisons, the chi-square test was used for categorical variables, the Mann–Whitney U test for non-normally distributed variables, and the t-test for normally distributed variables, as appropriate. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Variables that were significantly different between groups were included in univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression models with a 95% confidence interval. Finally, the variables that were significantly associated with the endpoint were included in a ROC analysis. All analyses were performed using S.

### Right-to-left shunt does not increase white matter lesion load in migraine with aura patients [^115a4nRa]. Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

White matter lesions (WMLs) are commonly found on brain MRI of migraine patients. Migraine with aura (MA+) is associated with an increased frequency of right-to-left shunt (RLS), mostly due to patent foramen ovale. The relationship between WML load and RLS in MA+ is currently unknown.

- **Methods**: MA+ patients were consecutively enrolled as part of the Shunt Associated Migraine (SAM) study. Patients underwent a standardized headache and vascular risk factors questionnaire, contrast-enhanced transcranial Doppler, blood coagulation tests, and brain MRI. RLS was categorized into four grades: no shunt, 10 mb single spikes pattern, and > 10 mb shower/curtain pattern. Standard and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery T2-weighted MRI sequences were inspected for WMLs by three independent raters blinded to RLS grade. WML load was scored in the periventricular areas (PV-WMLs) with the Fazekas scale and in the deep white matter (D-WMLs) with the Scheltens scale. Interobserver agreement was good to excellent (kappa = 0.64 to 0.96, p < 0.0001). WML load was then correlated between patients with and without RLS.

- **Results**: One hundred eighty-five patients (77% women) were included. PV-WML load was similar between patients with and without RLS. D-WML load decreased in patients with RLS (p = 0.045). On logistic regression analysis, only age was associated with WMLs (p < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: The presence of right-to-left shunt does not increase white matter lesion load in patients who have migraine with aura.

### Infarcts in the posterior circulation territory in migraine. The population-based MRI CAMERA study [^113Qqn4R]. Brain (2005). Low credibility.

In a previous study, migraine cases from the general population were found to be at significantly increased risk of silent infarct-like lesions in the posterior circulation (PC) territory of the brain, notably in the cerebellum. This study describes the clinical and neuroimaging characteristics of migraine cases with and without aura, as well as controls with PC lesions.

In total, 39 PC infarct-like lesions represented the majority (65%) of all 60 identified brain infarct-like lesions in the study sample (n = 435 subjects with and without migraine). Most lesions (n = 33) were located in the cerebellum, often multiple, and were round or oval-shaped, with a mean size of 7 mm. The majority (88%) of infratentorial infarct-like lesions had a vascular border zone location in the cerebellum. Prevalence of these border zone lesions differed between controls (0.7%), cases with migraine without aura (2.2%), and cases with migraine with aura (7.5%).

Besides higher age, cardiovascular risk factors were not more prevalent in cases with migraine with PC lesions. Presence of these lesions was not associated with supratentorial brain changes, such as white matter lesions. The combination of vascular distribution, deep border zone location, shape, size, and imaging characteristics on MRI makes it likely that the lesions have an infarct origin. Previous investigators attributed cases of similar 'very small' cerebellar infarcts in non-migraine patients to various infarct mechanisms. The relevance and likelihood of the aetiological options are placed in the context of known migraine pathophysiology.

### Serum l-arginine and dimethylarginine levels in migraine patients with brain white matter lesions [^112KH9WB]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

Migraine is a risk factor for the formation of silent brain white matter lesions (WMLs) that are possibly ischemic in nature. Although dysfunction of the L-arginine/nitric oxide (NO) pathway has been associated with oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in migraine, its role in WML development has not been specifically investigated. Thus, this prospective study aimed to measure the serum concentrations of the NO substrate L-arginine, the NO synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), and the L-arginine transport regulator symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) in migraine patients in a headache-free period.

- **Methods**: All participants underwent MR imaging to assess for the presence of WMLs on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging. A total of 109 migraine patients (43 with lesions, 66 without lesions) and 46 control individuals were studied. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to quantify L-arginine, ADMA, and SDMA serum concentrations. Migraine characteristics were investigated, and participants were screened for risk factors that can lead to elevated serum ADMA levels independent of migraine.

- **Results**: Migraine patients and controls did not differ in regard to vascular risk factors. Migraineurs with WMLs had a longer disease duration (p < 0.001) and a higher number of lifetime headache attacks (p = 0.005) than lesion-free patients. Higher L-arginine serum levels were found in both migraine subgroups compared to controls (p < 0.001). Migraine patients with WMLs showed higher ADMA concentrations than lesion-free patients and controls.

### Hypertension and cerebral diffusion tensor imaging in small vessel disease [^113KYZwq]. Stroke (2010). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a risk factor for cerebral small vessel disease, which includes white matter lesions (WML) and lacunar infarcts. These lesions are frequently observed on MRI scans of elderly people and play a role in cognitive decline. Preferably, one would like to evaluate the effect of hypertension before fluid-attenuated inversion recovery visible macrostructural lesions occur, possibly by investigating its effect on the microstructural integrity of the white matter. Diffusion tensor imaging provides measures of structural integrity.

- **Methods**: In 503 patients with small vessel disease, aged between 50 and 85 years, we cross-sectionally studied the relation between blood pressure, hypertension, and hypertension treatment status and diffusion tensor imaging parameters in both normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) and WMLs. All of the subjects underwent 1.5-T MRI and diffusion tensor imaging scanning. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity were calculated in both NAWM and WMLs.

- **Results**: Increased blood pressure and hypertension were significantly related to lower fractional anisotropy in both NAWM and WMLs, and to higher mean diffusivity in WMLs. For hypertensives, odds ratios for the risk of impaired microstructural integrity (fractional anisotropy) were 3.1 (95% CI: 1.8 to 5.7) and 2.1 (95% CI: 1.2 to 3.5) in NAWM and WMLs, respectively, compared with normotensives. Fractional anisotropy odds ratios for treated uncontrolled subjects were 6.5 (95% CI: 3.3 to 12.7) and 2.7 (95% CI: 1.5 to 5.1) in NAWM and WMLs, respectively, compared with normoten.

### Association of variant risk category with 2-year clinical and radiologic small vessel disease progression in patients with CADASIL [^111ZmTvn]. Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Clinical manifestations of severe NOTCH3-SVD, or CADASIL, include mid-adult onset of ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attacks, migraine with aura, mood disorders, and cognitive decline, ultimately leading to vascular dementia. Neuroimaging features are progressive symmetrical white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), lacunes, cerebral microbleeds, perivascular spaces, and atrophy. White matter hyperintensities can precede clinical manifestations by decades. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been shown to sensitively capture white matter tract alterations, even in areas with normal-appearing white matter on T2-weighted imaging, suggesting that DTI may provide readily quantifiable biomarkers in early CADASIL/NOTCH3-SVD stages.

Cross-sectional studies have provided compelling evidence that NOTCH3 variant risk category is a major modifier of NOTCH3-SVD severity, although this was not found in two studies of French patients. Prospective CADASIL follow-up studies taking into account the NOTCH3 risk category have not been performed so far. It is, therefore, unknown whether the NOTCH3 risk category is a predictor of disease progression. Determining to what extent the NOTCH3 risk category predicts (short-term) disease progression is important to improve individualized disease prediction, tailor disease monitoring and management, and enable patient stratification in future clinical trials. We performed a single-center, prospective 2-year follow-up study to investigate whether the NOTCH3 risk category is associated with clinical and neuroimaging disease progression in patients with CADASIL.

### Influence of small vessel disease and microstructural integrity on neurocognitive functioning in older individuals: The DANTE study Leiden [^113mYufn]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2017). Low credibility.

Small vessel disease is a major cause of neurocognitive dysfunction in the elderly. It may manifest as white matter hyperintensities, lacunar infarcts, cerebral microbleeds, and atrophy, which are visible on conventional MR imaging or as microstructural changes determined by diffusion tensor imaging. This study investigated whether microstructural integrity is associated with neurocognitive dysfunction in older individuals, irrespective of the conventional features of small vessel disease.

- **Materials and methods**: The study included 195 participants aged 75 years or older who underwent conventional 3T MR imaging with DTI to assess fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity. Cognitive tests were administered to assess cognitive domains. The Geriatric Depression Scale-15 and Apathy Scale of Starkstein were used to assess symptoms of depression and apathy, respectively. The association between DTI measures and neurocognitive function was analyzed using linear regression models.

- **Results**: In gray matter, lower fractional anisotropy and higher mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity were associated with worse executive function, psychomotor speed, and overall cognition. In white matter, these parameters were also associated with memory deficits. These findings were independent of white matter hyperintensities, lacunar infarcts, and cerebral microbleeds. However, after additional adjustment for normalized brain volume, only lower fractional anisotropy in white and gray matter and higher gray matter radial diffusivity remained significant.

### Microstructural white matter changes preceding white matter hyperintensities in migraine [^116LGPRw]. Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

We used magnetization transfer imaging to assess white matter tissue integrity in migraine, exploring whether microstructure was more diffusely affected beyond visible white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) and whether focal invisible microstructural changes precede visible focal WMHs in migraineurs.

- **Methods**: We included 137 migraineurs (79 with aura, 58 without aura) and 74 controls from the Cerebral Abnormalities in Migraine, an Epidemiological Risk Analysis (CAMERA) study. This longitudinal population-based study on structural brain lesions in migraine patients involved scans at baseline and at a 9-year follow-up. To assess microstructural brain tissue integrity, baseline magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) values were calculated for whole brain white matter. Baseline MTR values were determined for areas of normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) that progressed into MRI-detectable WMHs at follow-up and compared to MTR values of contralateral NAWM.

- **Results**: MTR values for whole brain white matter did not differ between migraineurs and controls. In migraineurs, but not in controls, NAWM that later progressed to WMHs at follow-up had lower mean MTR (mean [SD] 0.354 [0.009] vs 0.356 [0.008], p = 0.047) at baseline compared to contralateral white matter.

- **Conclusions**: We did not find evidence for widespread microstructural white matter changes in migraineurs compared to controls. However, our findings suggest that a gradual or stepwise process might be responsible for the evolution of focal invisible microstructural changes into focal migr…

### Headache, migraine, and structural brain lesions and function: Population based epidemiology of vascular ageing-MRI study [^114JRiS8]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

Headache assessment

Information on headaches was collected using a two-step approach among 1,188 participants during the second follow-up visit, four years after the baseline visit. Firstly, trained staff conducted face-to-face interviews, asking standardized questions about the lifetime history of severe headaches and headache features. Interviewers were specifically trained to administer the questionnaire, emphasizing the importance of the screening question about headache history to avoid missing participants with potential histories of severe headaches, particularly during young adulthood.

Secondly, participants who reported a history of severe headaches were invited to participate in a telephone interview with a neurologist specializing in headaches. The structured questionnaire used in this interview demonstrated good inter-rater agreement (κ = 0.83) and included the following information: duration of headaches, lifetime frequency of episodes, intensity of pain, pain characteristics and location, association of pain with physical activity, associated features such as sensitivity to sound and light as well as nausea, and details about aura features. A total of 242 participants were eligible for the interview. Of those, four died before the interview, four were unreachable or opted not to participate, and one had severe hearing impairment, resulting in 233 participants completing the interview. Information was gathered on detailed lifetime history of headache, specific migraine features, and aura symptoms.

### Association of small vessel ischemic white matter changes with BOLD fMRI imaging in the elderly [^1146kPo3]. Psychiatry Research (2012). Low credibility.

White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are often identified on T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images in the elderly. The WMHs are generally associated with small vessel ischemic or pre-ischemic changes. However, the association of WMHs with blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal is understudied. In this study, we evaluate how the BOLD signal change is related to the presence of WMHs in the elderly. Data were acquired as part of a study of late-life depression and included elderly individuals with and without major depression. The subjects were pooled because the presence of depression was not significantly associated with task-related BOLD changes, task performance, and WMH distribution.

A whole brain voxel-wise regression analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between WMH burden and BOLD signal change during finger-tapping in the parietal white matter. Our observation that WMHs are associated with a significant diminution of the BOLD signal change underscores the importance of considering cerebrovascular burden when interpreting fMRI studies in the elderly. The mechanism underlying the association of WMH and BOLD signal change remains unclear: the association may be mediated by changes in neural activation, changes in coupling between neuronal activity and hemodynamics, or, perhaps, secondary to the effect of the ischemic changes on the sensitivity of the T2✱ BOLD MR signal.

### Prevalence and characteristics of migraine in CADASIL [^113RDkYF]. Cephalalgia (2016). Low credibility.

Migraine with aura (MA) is a major symptom of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). This study assessed the spectrum of migraine symptoms and their potential correlates in a large prospective cohort of CADASIL individuals.

A standardized questionnaire was used with 378 CADASIL patients to evaluate headache symptoms, trigger factors, age at first attack, frequency of attacks, and associated symptoms. MRI lesions and brain atrophy were also quantified.

A total of 54.5% of individuals reported a history of migraine, with 84% experiencing mostly MA. Among individuals with MA, 62.4% were women, and the age at onset of MA was lower in women than in men. Atypical aura symptoms were reported by 59.3% of individuals with MA, and 19.7% of these patients experienced aura without accompanying headache. MA was the inaugural manifestation in 41% of symptomatic patients and was an isolated symptom in 12.1% of individuals.

Slightly higher MMSE and MDRS scores and lower Rankin scores were detected in the MA group. In conclusion, MA is observed in almost half of all CADASIL patients. Atypical aura symptoms are reported by more than one in two of these patients. MA is often inaugural, can remain isolated, and is not associated with the severity of the disorder.

### Association between headache laterality in migraine and hemispheric distribution of white matter hyperintensities on MRI [^111JmRAh]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

The goal of this study was to clarify whether headache laterality in patients with migraine with typically left- or right-sided headache during attacks is associated with the distribution of hemispheric white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) on brain MRI.

Cerebral WMHs are hyperintense lesions visible on brain MRI, believed to result from microvascular disease. WMHs occur four times more commonly in patients with migraine, though the cause and relevance of this association are currently unclear.

This cross-sectional study evaluated the MRI of patients with migraine who typically experience left- or right-sided headache during attacks. All WMHs were identified, and their location documented by reviewers blinded to headache laterality. We used Chi-square, Wilcoxon rank-sum, and Poisson regression to compare the characteristics of the two groups and multiple regression models to estimate the association of headache laterality with hemispheric WMH distribution while controlling for potential confounders.

Of 5,627 patients with migraine screened, 340 had typically left- or right-sided headache during attacks. Of these, 159 patients had an eligible brain MRI for review. Patients with left-sided headache were more likely to have hypertension (30.8% vs. 14.5%; p = 0.020) but less likely to smoke cigarettes (34.1% vs. 50.7%; p = 0.036) compared to patients with right-sided headache. Left-sided headache was associated with a higher burden of WMHs overall (9.8 vs. 6.2; p < 0.001), as well as in the left brain (5.1 vs. [the text appears to be truncated]).

### Value of patient-directed brain magnetic resonance imaging scan with a diagnosis of migraine [^115jSxPE]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine whether a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan in patients with a diagnosis of migraine, who insist on the performance of imaging, is of more benefit in detecting clinically significant unsuspected structural abnormalities than would be expected by chance.

- **Methods**: This prospective, observational, single-center study was performed from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2012, and included 100 subjects with a diagnosis of migraine and normal results on neurological examination. A brain MRI scan was performed on all patients solely at their request to detect an unsuspected clinically significant structural lesion.

- **Results**: Of the 100 patients, 86 were female, and the average age was 31.5 years. Forty-five patients experienced migraine without aura, 41 chronic migraine, and 14 migraine with aura. All of the patients had normal results on neurological examination. The duration of headaches ranged from 4 months to 40 years. In all, 82 of the MRI scans showed normal results, and 17 revealed clinically insignificant abnormalities. One MRI in a patient with chronic migraine without aura revealed a meningioma that subsequently required surgery and radiation therapy. The 1% prevalence of tumor in this study was then compared with two large cohorts of MRI abnormalities in the general asymptomatic population, in which tumor was found in 35 out of 3000. Fisher's exact test was used to compare the prevalence of tumor in the study population with the combined cohorts, and there was no statistical difference between these rates (P >).

### Diffusion- and perfusion-weighted MR imaging in persistent migrainous visual disturbances [^116zk2pT]. Cephalalgia (2005). Low credibility.

Pathological changes on diffusion-weighted MR scans had been described in hemiplegic migraine, and perfusion changes had been demonstrated in typical migraine aura with radio-isotope studies and, more recently, MR perfusion imaging. However, there is relatively little knowledge of the pathophysiology of long-lasting migraine aura and its possibly variant phenotype, visual snow. Our aim was to investigate with advanced MR techniques whether patients with long-lasting visual disturbance showed regional alterations in cerebral water diffusion and perfusion.

We studied four patients using MR perfusion and MR diffusion imaging. Two patients had typical visual aura, and two had a primary persistent visual disturbance (visual snow phenomenon). All patients had normal conventional structural MR imaging. MR diffusion-weighted images were acquired with a b-value of up to 1000 s/mm². From the diffusion-weighted images, we generated maps of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), which were inspected visually and used for ADC measurements of predefined regions of interest, including the visual, frontal, insular, and temporal cortices. MR perfusion imaging was performed using a bolus tracking technique with dynamic susceptibility-weighted images.

Color-coded maps of relative cerebral blood volume, mean transit time, and bolus arrival time were generated, as well as time-signal intensity curves over the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral artery territories. The maps of the ADC and above perfusion parameters appeared symmetrical in all patients with no evidence of decreased water.

### Small vessel versus large vessel vascular dementia: Risk factors and MRI findings [^114U4NYq]. Journal of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to conduct a cross-sectional comparison of clinical and MRI characteristics, along with risk factor profiles, between patients with small vessel disease (lacunae and white matter hyperintensities) and large vessel disease (large territorial or strategic infarcts) in a large cohort of VaD patients.

- **Methods**: Patients with VaD (NINDS-AIREN) were included in a large multicenter treatment trial, known as the VantagE study. All patients underwent examination by a neurologist and were interviewed about their medical history. Based on MRI results, patients were classified as having large vessel VaD, small vessel VaD, or a combination. Other MRI characteristics considered were white matter hyperintensities (WMH), medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA), and general cortical atrophy.

- **Results**: Of the 706 patients, 522 (74%) had small vessel disease, 126 (18%) had large vessel disease, and 58 (8%) had both. Patients with small vessel disease were typically older and less educated, showing more cortical and medial temporal lobe atrophy than those with large vessel disease. The most prevalent vascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, and smoking, were equally distributed between the different types of VaD. However, patients with large vessel disease exhibited more hypercholesterolemia and cardiac risk factors compared to those with small vessel disease.

- **Conclusion**: Cerebrovascular disease underlying VaD predominantly consists of small vessel disease, with large vessel disease accounting for about one-fifth of cases. This study highlights the heterogeneity between these two groups in terms of risk factor profiles and atrophy patterns.

### Are white matter abnormalities associated with "unexplained dizziness" [^116vK8fs]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2015). Low credibility.

Patients were included if they were aged between 45 and 90 years and were referred with dizziness to tertiary referral neuro-otology centres in London and Pisa. These are national centres of expertise in the diagnosis, investigation, and management of dizziness and imbalance, typically handling a combination of general and complex dizzy patients. "Dizzy" symptoms included true rotational vertigo, light-headedness, giddiness, and a sense of non-specific unsteadiness. Patients with no dizziness, psychogenic or functional dizziness, no imaging available or CT scan only (n = 3), and those aged > 90 (n = 17) were excluded.

In total, 122 patients (59 males) aged 45–90 were recruited. Patients were referred from general practitioners, neurologists, and ear, nose, and throat specialists from December 2010 to 2014. All patients (81 in London and 41 in Pisa) had been seen and examined by experienced neuro-otologists. For this study, the case notes were reviewed, and patients were divided into two groups based on history, clinical examination findings, and laboratory results.

- **Group 1**: Consisted of patients with 'explained' causes of dizziness. These included benign positional paroxysmal vertigo (BPPV) — history of brief, positional, rotational vertigo with a positive Dix–Hallpike manoeuvre — and vestibular neuritis, characterized by a history of acute prolonged rotational vertigo, associated with nausea, vomiting, and imbalance. It was noted with spontaneous, horizontal, unidirectional nystagmus, with a torsional component, a unilaterally positive head impulse test, and no other neurological abnormalities. Tests showed unilateral r…

### MRI white matter lesions in pediatric migraine [^114icDCc]. Cephalalgia (2013). Low credibility.

The study investigates the association between migraine and white matter hyperintensities on T2-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in adults, extending the research to pediatric patients with migraines.

- **Methods**: The medical files and imaging scans of 194 patients who underwent brain MRI at the headache clinic of a tertiary medical center from 2008 to 2011 were reviewed.

- **Results**: The mean age was 10.9 ± 3.5 years. Of the patients, 131 were diagnosed with migraine, while 63 were diagnosed with other disorders. In the migraine group, findings on physical and laboratory examinations were within normal range. White matter lesions were identified on MRI scans in 14 children with migraine (10.6%) and none of the children with other disorders (P = 0.006). In 13 out of 14 patients, the lesions were focal with a variable distribution, whereas one patient exhibited confluent periventricular hyperintensities.

- **Conclusions**: In the headache clinic of a tertiary pediatric medical center, white matter lesions are present in about 10% of pediatric patients with migraine.

### Susceptibility-weighted imaging in migraine with aura [^112LrRKd]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2011). Low credibility.

We report two patients with migraine with aura, in whom susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) showed transient prominence of the venous vasculature within areas of impaired perfusion. The findings resolved spontaneously in both patients. This imaging technique may play a helpful role in assessing the vascular events in migraine with aura.

### Patients with migraine do not have MRI-visible cortical lesions [^115F5dRs]. Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Migraine patients with multiple brain white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) may represent a diagnostic challenge. Using double inversion recovery (DIR) imaging, we studied whether cortical lesions (CLs) could be seen in these patients. Approval from the institutional review boards and written informed consent were obtained from each participant. CLs and WM lesions were assessed on brain scans from 32 migraine patients with WMHs (17 patients with and 15 without aura) and in two control groups consisting of 15 relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients and 20 healthy controls, matched for age and gender. By definition, brain WM lesions were detected in all migraine and RRMS patients. The number and volume of WM lesions were lower in migraine versus RRMS patients (p < 0.0001). No CLs were identified in migraine patients and healthy controls, whereas 20 CLs were seen in 9 (60%) of RRMS patients. The application of DIR imaging to assess focal cortical involvement seems to be useful in the diagnostic workup of patients with WMHs of unknown etiology, including those with migraine.

### Diagnostic strategies in CADASIL [^1143JhwT]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is an inherited autosomal dominant condition characterized by migraine, stroke, and dementia. It results from mutations in the NOTCH3 gene. However, mutations may occur at multiple sites, making molecular diagnosis time-consuming. The presence of granular osmiophilic material (GOM) on skin biopsy and involvement of the anterior temporal lobe and external capsule on MRI may aid in diagnosis.

- **Methods**: The authors identified 83 potential index cases from the British population and screened exons 2 to 23 of NOTCH3. MRI scans were scored using a modified Scheltens scale. Skin biopsy was performed in a subgroup.

- **Results**: Fifteen different point mutations were identified in 48 families — 73% in exon 4, 8% in exon 3, and 6% in each of exons 5 and 6. Moderate or severe involvement of the anterior temporal pole on MRI had a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 86% for diagnosing CADASIL, whereas external capsule involvement had a high sensitivity of 93% but a low specificity of 45%. Skin biopsy, performed in 18 cases, had a sensitivity of 45% and specificity of 100%.

- **Conclusions**: The spectrum of mutations in this study can be used to plan appropriate screening protocols. A suggested protocol is to screen exon 4 and proceed to exons 3, 5, and 6 where indicated. GOM on skin biopsy is diagnostic but can be negative. Anterior temporal pole involvement on MRI is a useful diagnostic marker.

### Prevalence and significance of the vessel-cluster sign on susceptibility-weighted imaging in patients with severe small vessel disease [^111XfSrJ]. Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Vessel-clusters on susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) and their corresponding appearance on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) have been examined. Vessel-clusters indicated in squares have been augmented (4x) to show details of SWI and FLAIR sequences. Another non-augmented vessel-cluster is indicated with a black arrow (C).

For each patient (A with CADASIL, B and C with sporadic SVD), the most informative SWI (left) and corresponding FLAIR (right) sequences are presented to show vessel-cluster appearance. Vessel-clusters are characterized by clustered small tubular structures, visible as low-signal dots (B and C) or lines (A, B, and C) on SWI, which do not correspond to normal appearing deep medullary veins (visible as mild low-signal parallel lines reaching the lateral ventricles from the deep white matter). Vessel-clusters are seen within white matter hyperintensities with different grades of cavitation: none (A), partial (B), or complete (C) cavitation.

The schematic appearance of vessel-clusters on SWI and the grade of cavitation on FLAIR are represented in the corresponding squares below the augmentations. SVD = small vessel disease.

### Epileptogenicity of white matter lesions in cerebral small vessel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111h726q]. Journal of Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Our findings suggest that white matter lesions (WML) are more frequent in patients with epilepsy than in controls. It seems reasonable to assume that WML of presumed vascular origin contribute to epileptogenesis in patients with late-onset epilepsy, especially for deep WML. As of now, no clear association between WML volume and epilepsy has been established. Currently, evidence is insufficient to determine whether WML are associated with an increased risk of seizure recurrence. Therefore, it remains unclear if patients with a first seizure and WML should receive antiseizure medication (ASM), even in the absence of cortical lesions. These aspects should be addressed in further studies, ideally focusing on a first-seizure patient population, with an emphasis on alterations of the deep white matter.

### Episodic neurologic dysfunction with migraine and reversible imaging findings after radiation [^1137YvwN]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Reported are three adults who developed frequent episodes of a complex neurologic syndrome years after radiation therapy for a brain tumor. MRI and [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET performed during the episodes demonstrated dramatic gyral thickening with enhancement and intense hypermetabolism in symptomatic regions that resolved on follow-up studies. EEG during episodes showed only slowing. The differential diagnosis and imaging findings are reviewed.

### Migraine with aura and risk of silent brain infarcts and white matter hyperintensities: An MRI study [^1137hoj7]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

A small number of population-based studies have reported an association between migraine with aura and the risk of silent brain infarcts and white matter hyperintensities in females. We investigated these relations in a population-based sample of female twins. Female twins aged 30–60 years, identified through the population-based Danish Twin Registry, were contacted. Based on questionnaire responses, the twins were invited to participate in a telephone-based interview conducted by physicians. Headache diagnoses were established according to the International Headache Society criteria. Cases with migraine with aura, their co-twins, and unrelated migraine-free twins (controls) were invited for a brain magnetic resonance imaging scan performed at a single center.

The brain scans were assessed for the presence of infarcts and white matter hyperintensities using visual rating scales and volumetric analyses, blinded to headache diagnoses. Comparisons were based on 172 cases, 34 co-twins, and 139 control subjects. Compared with control subjects, cases did not differ regarding the frequency of silent brain infarcts (four cases versus one control), periventricular white matter hyperintensity scores [adjusted mean difference (95% confidence interval): -0.1 (-0.5 to 0.2)] or deep white matter hyperintensity scores [adjusted mean difference (95% confidence interval): 0.1 (-0.8 to 1.1)] assessed by Scheltens' scale. Cases had a slightly higher total white matter hyperintensity volume compared with controls [adjusted mean difference (95% confidence interval): 0.17 (-0.08 to 0.41) cm³] and a similar difference.

### Headache, migraine, and structural brain lesions and function: Population based Epidemiology of Vascular Ageing-MRI study [^115dhtpV]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

Our findings extend our knowledge of the association between headache and white matter hyperintensities to non-migraine headache, likely tension-type headache, and to older people. Previous population-based studies could only evaluate the association between migraine and white matter hyperintensities, showing an increased risk. In a meta-analysis of case-control studies, migraine was associated with a fourfold increased risk (odds ratio 3.9, 95% confidence interval 2.26 to 6.72) of white matter abnormalities. For tension-type headache, our data confirm results from a previous small case-control study of 63 patients with chronic primary headache and 54 controls free of headache. This imaging study found that the prevalence of white matter abnormalities was similar for tension-type and migraine headaches (32.1% and 34.3%), and both were increased compared with controls (7.4%).

Our results of a strong association between migraine with aura and deep white matter hyperintensities extend the findings of the Cerebral Abnormalities in Migraine, an Epidemiological Risk Analysis (CAMERA) study. In this population-based sample of men and women aged 20 to 60 years from the Netherlands, overall migraine was associated with an increased load of deep white matter hyperintensities among women but did not differ according to migraine aura status. The association was stronger with a higher frequency of migraines, information that was not available in our study.

The CAMERA study further showed an association between migraine with aura and infarct-like…

### Migraine with aura and risk of silent brain infarcts and white matter hyperintensities: an MRI study [^111yuuA7]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

In this large population-based study of female twins, migraine with aura did not increase the risk of silent brain infarcts overall or of infarcts in the posterior circulation territory. The burden of deep white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), periventricular WMHs, and overall WMHs did not significantly differ in migraineurs compared with non-migraineurs, both in case-control analyses and in intra-pair analyses of twin pairs discordant for migraine with aura.

Few population-based studies have examined the relationship between migraine with aura and silent infarcts or WMHs. In the CAMERA study, migraine with aura was associated with a significantly increased risk of silent infarcts in the posterior circulation territory, particularly in the cerebellum, and in females, there was an increased risk of a load of deep WMHs compared with non-migraineur controls. In a study conducted in Iceland, where subjects had headache histories collected at midlife and brain scans performed later in life, a history of migraine with aura increased the risk of silent infarct-like lesions in the cerebellum in females with migraine with aura. Two other studies reported an increased prevalence of silent infarcts in subjects with migraine with aura, but these were located outside the cerebellum, and in one of these studies, no association between migraine with aura and WMHs was found. A recent meta-analysis of population-based studies demonstrated an association between WMHs and migraine with aura, but not for migraine without aura.

### Diffusion-weighted imaging and diagnosis of transient ischemic attack [^117HrnY5]. Annals of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

The work has strengths. We included three times more patients (9,000 vs. 2,500) and 80% more studies than previous reviews, including 35 studies published within their time period. We used rigorous methods and multiple overlapping searches; several authors double-checked the data. We assessed the most clinically relevant sources of heterogeneity for which there were data, having 47 studies allows four factors to be examined reliably.

There are also weaknesses. Analysis of original data in an individual patient data meta-analysis might be more informative but would be limited by the primary data quality. We were unable to assess the impact of the proportion of TIA patients in each study who did not have DWI, as this information was largely missing. Most studies reported only on patients who did have DWI and the findings. Not all patients can have MRI anyway, due to claustrophobia or contraindications.

If variation in the proportion scanned were a major source of variation in DWI positive rate, then we might have seen more difference between retrospective and prospective, or between expert-assessed and non-expert-assessed patients, but this was not the case. We did not perform complete duplicate assessments but used multiple cross-checks between reviewers to ensure validity. That we found more data in the time frame than two previous reviews suggests that our methods were sensitive.

We provide study quality markers in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2; these were used to assess heterogeneity, there being no valid tool for assessment of nonrandomized studies.

What are the implications? There…

### Prevalence and significance of the vessel-cluster sign on susceptibility-weighted imaging in patients with severe small vessel disease [^115GMvaB]. Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) can identify small brain blood vessels that contain deoxygenated blood due to its induced magnetic field disturbance. We observed focal clusters of possible dilated small vessels on SWI in white matter in severe small vessel disease (SVD). We assessed their prevalence, associations with SVD lesions, and vascular reactivity in patients with sporadic SVD and in patients with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL).

- **Methods**: Secondary cross-sectional analysis of a prospective multicenter observational study of patients with either sporadic SVD or CADASIL (INVESTIGATE-SVD) studied with 3 Tesla MRI including blood-oxygen-level-dependent MRI cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR). Two independent raters evaluated SWI sequences to identify "vessel-clusters" in white matter as focal low-signal dots/lines with small vessel appearance (interrater agreement, kappa statistic = 0.66). We assessed per-patient and per-cluster associations with SVD lesion type and severity on structural MRI sequences. We also assessed CVR within and at 2-voxel concentric intervals around the vessel-clusters using contralateral volumes as a reference.

- **Results**: Among the 77 patients enrolled, 76 had usable SWI sequences, 45 with sporadic SVD (mean age 64 years [SD 11], 26 men [58%]) and 31 with CADASIL (53 years [11], 15 men [48%]). We identified 94 vessel-clusters in 36 of the 76 patients (15/45 sporadic SVD, 21/31 CADASIL). In covariate-adjusted analysis, patients with…

### Migraine and risk of stroke [^112Ts7gN]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

Migraine is not considered to have long-term consequences for brain function, and guidelines suggest that people with migraine with a normal neurologic examination do not require routine MRI. Only for patients with atypical headache, a recent change in headache pattern, other symptoms (such as seizures), or focal neurologic symptoms or signs, is MRI of the brain recommended.

A source of concern for both physicians and patients are clinically silent structural brain lesions that are often revealed on MRI. These lesions are not specific to migraine, and the exact etiology and clinical significance remain uncertain. Neuroimaging studies indicate that migraine is a risk factor for silent brain lesions such as white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and silent infarct-like lesions.

- **Silent structural brain lesions**:
	- Data point towards a clear association with migraine with aura (MA), whereas the link to migraine without aura (MO) is more controversial. Some studies have also failed to find any association between MA and silent brain lesions. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors and specific antimigraine medication do not modify the association between structural brain lesions and migraine. Comparison of data across different studies is difficult, as different definitions of silent brain lesions are used. A clear distinction between migraine subtypes may be difficult, and migraine-related variables such as attack frequency, duration, and type of aura are not always reported.

### Vanishing cerebellar infarcts in a migraine patient [^116BDqHM]. Cephalalgia (2007). Low credibility.

Recent population-based studies have suggested that migraine is a risk factor for the development of infarct-like lesions in the territory of the posterior circulation. These lesions are thought to be true vascular infarcts based on their size, location, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics. However, as there are no postmortem studies identifying the pathology of these MRI findings, their true etiology is unknown. A case patient with migraine is presented who developed what appeared to be cerebellar infarcts on MRI; however, these lesions vanished on repeat imaging 16 days later, questioning their etiology as vascular ischemic-based infarcts.

### MRI-proven incident ischemia: A new marker of disease progression in small vessel diseases [^116Uaviq]. Stroke (2025). High credibility.

In ischemic cerebral small vessel diseases (cSVD), re-ischemic stroke is rare, occurring in only 2%-3% per year. Acute ischemia may not always lead to stroke in cSVD due to the small size of lesions. As a result, acute stroke may not reliably reflect ischemic activity or the risk of further clinical worsening, as both incident lacunes and incidental diffusion-weighted imaging-positive lesions can occur without stroke symptoms. This study aimed to evaluate the total ischemic activity by measuring the incidence of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-proven incident ischemia, independent of the presence of stroke symptoms, in a large cohort of cSVD.

- **Methods**: DHU-LAC is an ongoing French multicenter cohort study of MRI-proven ischemic stroke presumably due to cSVD. We report data on patients recruited between June 2018 and October 2023. In the DHU-LAC study, patients are enrolled within 15 days of stroke onset and are cared for according to guidelines. During the first 6 months, patients are systematically reassessed clinically and through brain MRI: (1) at any time if stroke symptoms occur and (2) at the end of the period. MRI-proven incident ischemia is defined as either re-ischemic stroke or at least one incident lacune or incidental diffusion-weighted imaging-positive lesion on brain MRI at 6 months.

- **Results**: Two hundred forty-nine patients were included, of whom 172 had available data at both inclusion and after 6 months. They were aged 63 ± 6 years, 28% were women, and 65% had hypertension. Six (3%) had a re-ischemic stroke, but an additional 25 (15%) had at least one incident lacune or incidental diffusion-weighted imaging-positive lesion.

### Headache, migraine, and structural brain lesions and function: Population based epidemiology of vascular ageing-MRI study [^112vZewx]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

We ran age-adjusted and multivariable-adjusted models for total and localized white matter hyperintensities. The multivariable models controlled for:

- **Demographics**: age (continuous), sex
- **Medical history**: history of hypertension (yes, no), family history of severe headache (yes, no)
- **Lifestyle factors**: smoking (ever, never), alcohol consumption (0, 1–19, 20–39, ≥ 40 g/day)
- **Physical measurements**: body mass index (< 25, 25 to 29, ≥ 30 weight (kg)/(height (m²))
- **Biochemical measures**: serum total cholesterol level (continuous)

Results remained essentially unchanged when the models were additionally controlled for:

- **Additional medical history**: history of diabetes, systolic blood pressure, history of vascular disease

We calculated P for trend across mean values of the categories for volume third by using a logistic regression model contrasting a specific headache type to participants without a history of headache.

Because the volumes of localized and total white matter hyperintensities are correlated, we used the residual method to evaluate the association between headache types and volume of localized white matter hyperintensities — that is, deep or periventricular — above and beyond the association with the total volume.

In exploratory analyses, we stratified the association between headache status and volume of white matter hyperintensities (highest third versus lowest two thirds) by:

- **Demographics and history**: age (< 70, ≥ 70 years), sex
- **Medical and family history**: history of hypertension, family history of severe headache, history of cardiovascular disease
- **Lifestyle factor**: smoking (ever versus never), adjusting for age

We further evaluated whether the association between migraine and volume of white matter hyperintensities was modified by full classification criteria.

### Brain stem and cerebellar hyperintense lesions in migraine [^113hyUqN]. Stroke (2006). Low credibility.

Migraineurs are at increased risk of cerebellar infarcts and supratentorial white matter lesions. The prevalence, frequency, and distribution of infratentorial hyperintense lesions in migraine are unknown.

- **Methods**: Migraineurs with aura (n = 161), without aura (n = 134), and controls (n = 140) from a population-based sample of adults (30 to 60 years of age) were evaluated with MRI.

- **Results**: Infratentorial hyperintensities were identified in 13 of 295 (4.4%) migraineurs and in 1 of 140 (0.7%) controls (P = 0.04). Twelve cases had hyperintensities, mostly bilaterally, in the dorsal basis pontis. Those with infratentorial hyperintensities also had supratentorial white matter lesions more often.

- **Conclusions**: We found an increased prevalence of infratentorial (mostly pontine) hyperintensities in migraineurs from the general population. This extends the knowledge about vulnerable brain regions and types of lesions in migraine brains. A hemodynamic ischemic pathogenesis is likely, but further research is needed.

### What are white matter hyperintensities made of? Relevance to vascular cognitive impairment [^114fmmdP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). High credibility.

White matter hyperintensities (WMH) of presumed vascular origin, also referred to as leukoaraiosis, are a very common finding on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) in older subjects and in patients with stroke and dementia. They are associated with cognitive impairment, tripling the risk of stroke and doubling the risk of dementia. Knowledge of their pathology derives mostly from post-mortem studies, many from some years ago. These studies, by their nature, were generally small, sampled from selected brain regions, and likely reflect late-stage disease. They focus on features of demyelination and axonal degeneration, which may be easier to detect histopathologically than changes in extracellular fluid.

Advances in brain MRI are revealing white matter hyperintensities at earlier stages and changes in normal-appearing white matter that indicate tissue pathology, less marked than those found in WMH. These "pre-visible" changes show that altered interstitial fluid mobility and water content, which may be reversible, probably predate demyelination and axonal damage. These latter changes are less likely to be reversible and are probably a late-stage phenomenon. Neuroimaging is also revealing the dynamic nature of WMH, their interactions with other pathological features, such as secondary cortical and long tract damage, and their contribution to accumulating brain damage. These insights provide opportunities to improve understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of small vessel disease and represent an enormous unfinished agenda for research.

### White matter lesions in migraine [^117XkQsm]. The American Journal of Pathology (2021). Low credibility.

Migraine, the third most common disease worldwide, is a well-known independent risk factor for subclinical focal deep white matter lesions (WMLs), even in young and otherwise healthy individuals with no cardiovascular risk factors. These WMLs are more commonly seen in migraine patients with transient neurologic symptoms preceding their headaches, the so-called aura, and those with a high attack frequency.

The pathophysiology of migraine-related deep white matter hyperintensities remains poorly understood despite their prevalence. Characteristic differences in their distribution compared with those of common periventricular WMLs in the elderly suggest a different underlying mechanism. Both ischemic and inflammatory mechanisms have been proposed, as there is increased cerebral vulnerability to ischemia in migraineurs, whereas there is also evidence of blood-brain barrier disruption with associated release of proinflammatory substances during migraine attacks. An enhanced susceptibility to spreading depolarization, the electrophysiological event underlying migraine, may be the mechanism that causes repetitive episodes of cerebral hypoperfusion and neuroinflammation during migraine attacks.

WMLs can negatively affect both physical and cognitive function, underscoring the public health importance of migraine, and suggesting that migraine is an important contributor to neurologic deficits in the general population.
