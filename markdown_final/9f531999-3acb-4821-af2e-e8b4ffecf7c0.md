## Question

What part of body should emg be of full body twitching

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which muscles should be selected for EMG in a patient with "full-body twitching", i.e., generalized fasciculations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical presentation and differential diagnosis and how EMG adds value. Then, I should align the sampling strategy with ALS diagnostic frameworks that require multi-region lower motor neuron involvement. Next, I need to prioritize high-yield muscles by region, including thoracic paraspinals and distal limb targets, and clarify the bulbar approach. After that, I should design an efficient protocol that balances sensitivity, specificity, and patient comfort. Finally, I need to ensure concurrent NCS, address technical considerations like ultrasound guidance and observation time to detect fasciculations, and plan for follow-up if findings are equivocal [^113BB9MG] [^111X7yhQ] [^1172XCEa].

> Let me first confirm the clinical framing. "Full-body twitching" signals widespread fasciculations, which can be seen in ALS but also in benign fasciculation syndrome (BFS), metabolic derangements, drug effects, and other hyperexcitability states, so I should not jump to conclusions without correlating a focused history and examination with EMG evidence of active and chronic denervation in clinically affected and unaffected muscles [^113BB9MG]. Hold on, I should verify prognostic nuance: BFS often follows a benign course even when minor EMG abnormalities are present, but rare cases with cramps and fasciculations progressed to ALS over years, so longitudinal follow-up remains critical when initial EMG shows fasciculations without denervation changes, typically for 4–5 years to be confident about stability [^11738QXR] [^116A3JP7] [^114X95To].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic framework. The El Escorial construct operationalizes EMG evidence of lower motor neuron dysfunction across bulbar, cervical, thoracic, and lumbosacral regions, with the best sensitivity–specificity balance when abnormalities are present in at least two regions, and with cranial and thoracic segments often having higher specificity for ALS when abnormal, which directly informs muscle selection strategy across regions [^111X7yhQ]. Wait, let me verify regional variability: thoracic paraspinal examination increases specificity for ALS against non-ALS neuromuscular disorders, whereas bulbar-onset ALS can sometimes have near-normal limb EMG early and lower frequencies of thoracic abnormalities, reinforcing the need for a broad, multi-region sampling plan even when exam is subtle in certain domains [^1164KroY] [^113BB9MG].

> I will now examine which muscles are most informative. Distal limb muscles demonstrate the highest electrodiagnostic yield for both active and chronic denervation across onset regions, and noncontiguous spread can be captured by sampling beyond the clinically symptomatic limb; an optimally selected set of roughly six upper extremity and five lower extremity muscles can detect more than 98% of potentially positive cervical or lumbosacral segments, which is a key efficiency principle I should apply here [^114VGJmg]. Let me consider pathophysiology to justify distal targeting: distal predominance at symptom onset and disproportionate involvement of distal motor neuron pools support prioritizing distal hand and ankle dorsiflexors early in the study, even when proximal examination is unremarkable [^111x3n1V].

> Thoracic representation is crucial, so I need to ensure thoracic paraspinal sampling. I should confirm that thoracic paraspinals offer high specificity for ALS relative to mimics, often revealing clinically silent denervation that helps meet multi-region criteria and differentiate ALS from spondylotic or focal neuropathic processes, particularly valuable when limb findings are borderline or confounded by coexisting neuropathy [^1164KroY]. Hold on, I should verify the criteria nuance again: El Escorial-supporting analyses emphasize that abnormalities in the thoracic segment, even in a single muscle, can be disproportionately informative for classification compared with limb segments that may require more than one abnormal muscle, so TPSP earns a high priority slot in the sampling plan [^111X7yhQ].

> Now for the bulbar region, I need to think carefully about muscle choice and feasibility. Initially, I thought the frontalis muscle was superior to the tongue because relaxation is achievable in 85% of patients versus only 6% for the tongue; wait, I should double-check that because those exact relaxation rates actually pertain to the trapezius versus the tongue rather than the frontalis, so I must correct that misattribution while preserving the core point about practical bulbar targeting [^116KFbqY]. Let me reconsider: frontalis EMG is feasible with better relaxation than tongue or SCM and can reveal subclinical craniobulbar involvement, whereas the trapezius and SCM also show frequent spontaneous activity in ALS and, importantly, the trapezius achieves complete relaxation in approximately 85% of ALS patients compared with only about 6% in the tongue, making trapezius a highly practical bulbar-proxy target with excellent specificity against cervical spondylosis cohorts, while the tongue adds limited utility when clinical atrophy is already present [^1137wMgn] [^116KFbqY].

> Designing a comprehensive but efficient protocol, I should prioritize distal and paraspinal muscles while tailoring to the history and exam. Let me think about a pragmatic set: in the upper limbs, first dorsal interosseous or extensor indicis with abductor pollicis brevis provides high yield; in the lower limbs, tibialis anterior with extensor hallucis longus and gastrocnemius often captures early denervation; thoracic paraspinals should represent the thoracic region; and if cranial symptoms are present or suspicion is high, adding frontalis and/or trapezius provides bulbar assessment that is more feasible than the tongue in many patients [^114VGJmg] [^1137wMgn] [^116KFbqY]. I should confirm adequate observation time for fasciculations in each sampled muscle, since up to 90 seconds may be needed to confidently exclude fasciculations in ALS; cutting short can miss low-frequency events, so I need to plan the room time accordingly and balance patient comfort because muscle selection is the key modifiable driver of EMG-related pain and efficiency in practice [^114Z6AMV] [^112YwSYc].

> Hold on, I should verify that nerve conduction studies accompany the needle exam to exclude mimics. AANEM guidance is explicit that NCS and needle EMG should be designed and interpreted together by a trained neuromuscular physician after a focused history and examination, because NCS alone will miss critical motor unit information and isolated EMG without tailored NCS can fail to identify coexisting neuropathies or radiculopathies that alter pretest probability and muscle selection logic [^1172XCEa]. I need to ensure the same physician supervises and integrates both components to maintain diagnostic accuracy and appropriateness of the study design [^1172XCEa].

> Technical execution matters, so I should consider factors that influence data quality and safety. For deep or technically challenging targets like paraspinals, ultrasound guidance can increase accuracy, particularly for less experienced operators, which can reduce repeat insertions and enhance diagnostic yield; examiner experience and careful auditory and visual pattern recognition remain foundational regardless of guidance modality, and applying direct pressure after needle removal minimizes bleeding risk even in patients on anticoagulants or antiplatelets, where the hematoma risk appears low with proper technique [^114E7G3Z] [^1115fNVp] [^115tpGk7]. But wait, what if poor relaxation or endplate noise increases pain and artifact in certain muscles; I should adapt the sequence and choice to minimize endplate sampling time because endplate noise correlates with greater reported pain, reinforcing the importance of thoughtful muscle order and time allocation in the protocol [^112YwSYc].

> I should also consider the thoracic domain in relation to respiratory involvement. Needle EMG can detect early respiratory muscle denervation but is not routinely performed; in practice, serial assessment of respiratory muscle strength with multiple tests is recommended because no single test reliably predicts respiratory failure, so while thoracic paraspinal EMG satisfies regional sampling and may reflect thoracic LMN loss, monitoring forced vital capacity and inspiratory pressure measures in parallel is prudent when ALS remains a concern even if the initial study is focused on limb and paraspinal muscles [^117QGwJX] [^116f4Qzr].

> Finally, I should plan for diagnostic uncertainty and follow-up. If EMG demonstrates fasciculations without fibrillations, positive sharp waves, or chronic neurogenic motor unit changes confined to a single region, I need to consider BFS or other hyperexcitability syndromes and arrange longitudinal clinical and EMG follow-up over years given rare phenotransitions to ALS; adjunctive approaches such as high-density surface EMG can support fasciculation quantification, and 15-minute recordings may suffice for reliable home monitoring of fasciculation metrics when logistics preclude longer sessions, though this complements rather than replaces a properly sampled needle EMG [^11738QXR] [^116A3JP7] [^114J6T1X].

> Putting this together, my answer is that in "full-body twitching", the EMG should sample across regions with emphasis on thoracic paraspinal muscles and distal limb muscles, supplemented by practical bulbar targets when indicated. Specifically, I would prioritize thoracic paraspinals for the thoracic domain, first dorsal interosseous or extensor indicis and abductor pollicis brevis for the upper limbs, tibialis anterior with extensor hallucis longus and gastrocnemius for the lower limbs, and frontalis and/or trapezius when bulbar involvement is suspected or to document a craniocervical domain, recognizing that trapezius offers excellent relaxation and high specificity while frontalis is more easily relaxed than tongue and can reveal subclinical bulbar denervation; I would ensure NCS are performed and interpreted concurrently by a neuromuscular physician, use ultrasound guidance for deep targets as needed, and observe each muscle long enough to capture low-frequency fasciculations, thereby maximizing diagnostic yield while minimizing patient burden [^114VGJmg] [^1164KroY] [^1137wMgn] [^116KFbqY] [^1172XCEa] [^114Z6AMV].

For full-body twitching, EMG should sample **at least one proximal and one distal muscle in each limb, plus a bulbar muscle** [^114VGJmg] (e.g. tongue or sternocleidomastoid) [^116KFbqY] and a thoracic paraspinal muscle [^1164KroY] to assess for widespread lower motor neuron involvement [^113BB9MG]. This distribution helps distinguish generalized motor neuron disease from peripheral neuropathies or myopathies, and additional muscles may be added based on clinical findings [^1115fNVp]. EMG should be performed by a **trained neuromuscular physician** [^1172XCEa] to ensure accurate interpretation and diagnosis.

### Recommended muscle groups for EMG in full-body twitching

Recommended muscle groups for **EMG evaluation** [^114VGJmg] in patients with full-body twitching include:

| **Muscle group** | **Specific muscles** | **Clinical rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Upper limbs | - First dorsal interosseous [^114VGJmg] <br/> - Abductor pollicis brevis <br/> - Deltoid <br/> - Triceps brachii | - Assess distal and proximal upper limb involvement [^113BB9MG] <br/> - Commonly affected in motor neuron diseases |
| Lower limbs | - Tibialis anterior [^114VGJmg] <br/> - Gastrocnemius <br/> - Vastus medialis <br/> - Gluteus medius | - Evaluate distal and proximal lower limb involvement [^113BB9MG] <br/> - High yield for detecting lower motor neuron dysfunction [^115znSBt] |
| Bulbar muscles | - Tongue (genioglossus) <br/> - Sternocleidomastoid <br/> - Trapezius [^116KFbqY] <br/> - Frontalis [^1137wMgn] | - Essential for assessing bulbar involvement [^113BB9MG] <br/> - Important in ALS and other motor neuron diseases |
| Paraspinal muscles | - Thoracic paraspinals [^111PEswq] <br/> - Lumbar paraspinals | - Useful for detecting widespread lower motor neuron involvement <br/> - Differentiates ALS from other neuromuscular disorders [^1164KroY] |

### Clinical considerations and guidelines

- **Clinical correlation**: EMG findings must be correlated with clinical symptoms and signs [^113BB9MG] to accurately diagnose underlying neuromuscular disorders [^1115fNVp].
- **Expertise required**: EMG should be performed and interpreted by trained neuromuscular physicians [^1172XCEa] to ensure accurate diagnosis and avoid misinterpretation.
- **Patient comfort**: Muscle selection should consider patient comfort [^112YwSYc], as certain muscles may cause more discomfort during needle insertion [^114VGJmg].

---

### Conclusion

EMG evaluation of full-body twitching should include proximal and distal muscles in each limb, plus bulbar and paraspinal muscles. This approach ensures **accurate diagnosis** of underlying neuromuscular disorders (such as ALS) [^111X7yhQ] and differentiates them from other conditions.

### Proper performance and interpretation of electrodiagnostic studies [^1172XCEa]. Muscle & Nerve (2015). Low credibility.

The AANEM strongly recommends that EDX procedures be performed by physicians with comprehensive knowledge of neurological and musculoskeletal disorders to assure accurate interpretation and diagnosis. Individuals without a medical education in neuromuscular disorders and without special training in EDX procedures typically are not qualified to interpret the waveforms generated by NCSs and needle EMGs or to correlate the findings with other clinical information to reach a diagnosis. It is also the AANEM's position that the same physician should directly supervise and interpret the NCSs, including those performed by an EDX technician.

The AANEM believes that interpreting NCS without performing a focused history and physical examination and without having oversight over the design and performance is inappropriate. Nerve conduction studies performed independent of needle EMG studies may only provide a portion of the information needed to diagnose muscle, nerve root, and most nerve disorders. For this reason, it is the position of the AANEM that, except in unique situations, NCSs and needle EMG should be performed together in a study design determined by a trained neuromuscular physician.

There are common diagnoses that depend on performing a needle EMG and combining the needle EMG data with the NCS data. Needle EMG studies are a necessary part of the evaluation in the diagnosis of myopathy, radiculopathy, plexopathy, disorders of the motor neuron, peripheral neuropathies, and most disorders of the individual peripheral motor nerves. When the NCS is used on its own without integrating needle EMG findings, it may not provide comprehensive diagnostic information.

### Electrodiagnostic findings in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: Variation with region of onset and utility of thoracic paraspinal muscle examination [^1164KroY]. Muscle & Nerve (2024). Low credibility.

Limited data exist regarding the variation of electrodiagnostic (EDX) findings in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients with different onset regions and the specificity of thoracic paraspinal muscle (TPSP) examination for confirming a diagnosis of ALS. This study aimed to demonstrate the variation of EDX features and characterize the utility of TPSP muscle examination in the electrodiagnosis of ALS.

This retrospective study involved a large cohort of ALS patients who underwent comprehensive EDX evaluation. The study included 448 patients, all of whom fulfilled the Gold Coast criteria for ALS. The average age at the time of EDX study was 64 years, and 41.1% were women. The onset region was identified as follows: bulbar (N = 149), cervical (N = 127), lumbosacral (N = 162), and other (N = 10).

In contrast to limb onset, bulbar-onset patients more frequently demonstrated a pattern of normal or near-normal needle electromyography (EMG) (p < 0.0001) and less frequently had abnormalities on EMG of TPSP (p = .002). Clinical or EDX diagnosis of sensory polyneuropathy was present in 12.6% of patients, occurring more frequently in the lumbosacral onset subgroup (p < 0.03). EMG showed active denervation in 9.6% and chronic denervation in 59% of craniobulbar muscles examined, with no observed difference among different onset regions. TPSP showed higher frequencies of active and chronic denervation in ALS patients compared to a group of patients with non-ALS neuromuscular disorders.

EDX features may differ among ALS patients with different onset regions. TPSP EMG is highly useful in differentiating ALS from other neuromuscular disorders.

### Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a clinical review [^113BB9MG]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of ALS relies on the medical history, physical examination, electrodiagnostic testing (with needle EMG), and neuroimaging. EMG remains a very useful diagnostic tool to confirm lower motor neuron (LMN) involvement in clinically affected and non-affected muscles, indicated by fibrillation potentials, sharp waves, fasciculation potentials in relaxed muscles, and chronic neurogenic changes upon contraction.

Biomarkers can play a crucial role in diagnostic, prognostic, or predictive research studies. They could potentially become important for stratification of patients and monitoring treatment effects in clinical trials. Although not yet integrated into standard clinical practice, several biomarkers, such as cerebrospinal fluid neurofilament levels (especially phosphorylated neurofilament heavy subunit), are useful in supporting the diagnosis, particularly in patients with very recent onset of muscle weakness, without clear signs of upper motor neuron (UMN) involvement, or with concomitant neuropathy/plexopathy/cervical myelopathy.

Brain and spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging is often performed to exclude structural lesions affecting the motor system. Furthermore, 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18 F-FDG) positron emission tomography, if readily available, can reveal a typical pattern of hypometabolism in Rolandic brain regions and frontotemporal involvement.

Genetic testing of the five most prevalent genes found to be mutated in ALS is routinely offered to patients with a positive family history (C9orf72, SOD1, TDP-43, FUS, TBK-1). Although there is no consensus on standard genetic testing protocols, this approach is becoming an essential part of the clinical assessment.

### Optimizing muscle selection for electromyography in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^114VGJmg]. Muscle & nerve (2017). Low credibility.

We compared the yield of limb and thoracic paraspinal muscle examination for revealing lower motor neuron (LMN) dysfunction on electromyography (EMG) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of 354 patients with clinically definite or probable ALS was performed. Seventeen limb muscles and thoracic paraspinal muscles were evaluated for the presence of both active and chronic denervation.

- **Results**: Distal limb muscles showed the highest electrodiagnostic sensitivities of LMN dysfunction in ALS regardless of onset region and diagnostic certainty at the time of diagnosis. Electrodiagnostic yield is higher in muscles from the onset limb. Noncontiguous spread of lower motor neuron degeneration is present in ALS. Optimally selected 6 upper and 5 lower extremity muscles yielded > 98% of potential positive cervical or lumbosacral segments.

- **Conclusions**: An algorithmic approach to needle EMG in ALS based on pretest probability of individual muscles optimizes electrodiagnostic yield, thus possibly minimizing test duration and patient discomfort. Muscle Nerve 56: 36–44, 2017.

### Needle electromyography of the frontalis muscle in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^1137wMgn]. Muscle & Nerve (2016). Low credibility.

We sought to determine which muscles to choose for better assessment of the craniobulbar region in establishing the diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

- **Methods**: We studied the frontalis muscle in 83 controls and compared it with the tongue, sternocleidomastoid (SCM), and trapezius muscles in 105 definite or probable ALS patients (54 bulbar, 51 nonbulbar).

- **Results**: More patients achieved complete relaxation of the frontalis muscle than the tongue or SCM. Motor unit potentials were of longer duration and higher amplitude in ALS patients than in controls (P < 0.05). The frontalis had the same frequency of spontaneous potentials as the tongue, SCM, and trapezius muscles in bulbar ALS patients, but fewer than in the trapezius in nonbulbar patients.

- **Conclusions**: Examining the frontalis provides useful information in establishing the diagnosis of ALS by identifying clinically evident or subclinical abnormalities in the craniobulbar region. Muscle Nerve 54: 1093–1096, 2016.

### Decrement in area of muscle responses to repetitive nerve stimulation [^115HBkJX]. Muscle & Nerve (2003). Low credibility.

Measurement of the decremental muscle response to repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) has low yields for the diagnosis of neuromuscular transmission defects compared with single fiber electromyography (SFEMG). We compared the area and amplitude of muscle responses to RNS in 87 patients and 30 controls, using SFEMG as the reference standard. Decrement of response area provided additional diagnostic yields of 5.3% to 30% depending on the muscle examined and disease severity, and is recommended as a diagnostic adjunct to the measurement of amplitude decrement during RNS.

### Assessment of pulmonary function in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: when can polygraphy help evaluate the need for non-invasive ventilation [^117QGwJX]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

There are several measures of respiratory muscle strength. An FVC < 50%, seated or supine, has been widely applied as the threshold to initiate NPPV. Moreover, measurements of respiratory muscle strength, nocturnal gas exchange, and symptomatic complaints are used as indicators to start NPPV.

Several consensus statements recommend starting NPPV when daytime hypercapnia and nocturnal hypoventilation are present, when maximum inspiratory pressure is < 60 cm H2O, or if nocturnal arterial oxygen saturation (artSpO2) is < 88% for more than five consecutive minutes. However, these recommendations are not based on controlled studies and none were developed selectively for ALS.

Detecting early respiratory dysfunction in ALS is important, but proving to be problematic. Needle electromyography (EMG) seems to be a sensitive measure of early respiratory failure in ALS, but it is usually not a routine component. Therefore, in daily routine, one must use several measures of respiratory muscle strength to monitor the progression of respiratory muscle weakness in ALS, as no single respiratory test can reliably predict the onset of respiratory failure.

We aimed to study the usefulness of polygraphy to predict respiratory failure. In contrast to polysomnography, polygraphy represents an alternative, less time-consuming, and cost-effective method for measuring sleep parameters without utilizing EEG recordings. Although analysis of sleep architecture (sleep states) is impossible, it provides detailed information on nightly respiration, together with peripheral…

### Preventing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: Insights from pre-symptomatic neurodegenerative diseases [^111PEswq]. Brain (2022). Low credibility.

Clinically manifest ALS is preceded, at least in some patients, by a prodromal stage characterized by non-specific symptoms such as muscle cramps and reduced exercise tolerance. Signs include fasciculation, isolated loss of ankle reflexes, and diffuse hyperreflexia, alongside EMG abnormalities like positive sharp waves in a single limb muscle or thoracic paraspinal muscles. Importantly, these findings indicate a deviation from healthy physiology. However, they should be insufficient for an experienced neurologist to determine the unequivocal emergence of clinically manifest ALS and should not be obviously attributable to another cause.

By analogy to the recognized clinical syndromes of MCI (mild cognitive impairment) and MBI (mild behavioral impairment) in other neurodegenerative diseases, we propose the term mild motor impairment (MMI) to describe this prodromal period. Notably, prodromal manifestations remain 'pre-symptomatic' since they are insufficient to confirm that clinically manifest disease has emerged. We suggest the term phenotransition to describe the initial appearance of mild impairment and the shift from the pre-manifest to the prodromal stage of pre-symptomatic disease. The rationale for this term is multifaceted: it distinguishes the emergence of MMI from clear clinical evidence of ALS, captures the observation that MMI has an overt phenotype, and embodies the notion that the individual is entering a transitional stage, such as MMI.

### Accuracy of electromyography needle placement in cadavers: Non-guided vs. ultrasound guided [^114E7G3Z]. Muscle & Nerve (2011). Low credibility.

Accuracy of needle electromyography is typically ensured by the use of anatomical landmarks and auditory feedback related to voluntary activation of the targeted muscle. However, in certain clinical situations, landmarks may not be palpable, auditory feedback may be limited or not present, and targeting a specific muscle may be more critical. In such settings, image guidance might significantly enhance accuracy.

- **Methods**: Two electromyographers with different levels of experience examined 14 muscles in each of 4 fresh-frozen cadaver lower limbs. Each muscle was tested a total of eight times; four fine wires were inserted without ultrasound (US) guidance and four were inserted under US guidance. Overall accuracy, as well as accuracy rates for the individual electromyographers, were calculated.

- **Results**: Non-guided needle placement was significantly less accurate than US-guided needle placement, particularly in the hands of less experienced electromyographers, supporting the use of real-time US guidance in certain challenging situations in the electromyography laboratory.

### Fasciculations and cramps: How benign? Report of four cases progressing to ALS [^116A3JP7]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Clinical diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in patients presenting with cramps and fasciculations may not be evident at the first consultation. Sequential reviews, both clinical and neurophysiological, form an important part of clinical practice in such cases. Recent attempts to delineate a more benign group with cramps and fasciculations have lacked information on the long-term profile, both clinical and neurophysiological. Four patients who were initially diagnosed with benign cramps and fasciculations, but who subsequently progressed to ALS, are described. We propose that a diagnosis of benign cramps and fasciculations should not be considered secure without a minimum follow-up of 4–5 years.

### Dysport [^116GP1fY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Dosing in initial and subsequent treatment sessions should be tailored to the individual based on several factors: the size, number, and location of muscles involved, the severity of spasticity, the presence of local muscle weakness, the patient's response to previous treatment, and/or adverse reaction history with botulinum toxins.

No more than 1 mL should generally be administered at any single injection site. The maximum recommended total dose (upper and lower limb combined) for the treatment of spasticity in adults is 1500 Units. Although the actual location of the injection sites can be determined by palpation, the use of injection guiding techniques (e.g. electromyography, electrical stimulation, or ultrasound) is recommended to target the injection sites accurately.

- **Upper limb spasticity**: In the clinical trial that assessed the efficacy and safety of Dysport for the treatment of upper limb spasticity in adults, doses of 500 Units and 1000 Units were divided among selected muscles at a given treatment session. Repeat Dysport treatment should be administered when the effect of a previous injection has diminished, but no sooner than 12 weeks after the previous injection. A majority of patients in clinical studies were retreated between 12–16 weeks; however, some patients had a longer duration of response (i.e. 20 weeks). The degree and pattern of muscle spasticity at the time of re-injection may necessitate alterations in the dose of Dysport.

### Progress towards a standard of quantitative twitch monitoring [^1114SL4v]. Anaesthesia (2020). High credibility.

Finally, Thomsen et al. have proposed that we should routinely perform twitch monitoring in patients who receive only succinylcholine, to detect residual neuromuscular blockade due to pseudocholinesterase deficiency. This is a provocative suggestion because pseudocholinesterase deficiency is seldom considered in discussions of residual neuromuscular blockade, which tend to focus on non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking drugs. Most providers probably do not currently utilize twitch monitoring when succinylcholine is administered for tracheal intubation. Indeed, monitoring succinylcholine blockade seems to be a reasonable proposal, as it turns out that succinylcholine causes fade in the TOF stimulation responses after normal doses for tracheal intubation, contrary to the popular notion that it only causes diminution of twitch height, but not fade.

In conclusion, we urge the use of routine quantitative twitch monitoring. Although electromyography has a number of advantages, acceleromyography can be used effectively, especially when a baseline TOF ratio can be obtained before administration of the neuromuscular blocking drug, allowing for normalization of subsequent TOF measurements. The trachea should not be extubated until the TOF ratio reaches a normalized value of at least 0.9. The widespread adoption of quantitative twitch monitoring could be enhanced by the increased participation of professional societies and the availability of more reliable and user-friendly twitch monitors, which should be validated by comparison with mechanomyography.

### European academy of neurology/peripheral nerve society guideline on diagnosis and treatment of Guillain-Barré syndrome [^116zNDNH]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Guillain-Barré syndrome, specifically with respect to electrodiagnostic testing, EAN/PNS 2023 guidelines recommend assessing the following electrodiagnostic features (high sensitivity but low specificity) to support the diagnosis of GBS, without excluding disorders that mimic GBS, in patients evaluated within one week after disease onset:

- **Sensory and/or motor conduction abnormalities**: Consistent with a polyneuropathy.
- **Absent H-reflexes**: This is a significant indicator.
- **Facial nerve direct responses**: Showing either increased distal motor latency or decreased compound muscle action potential amplitude.
- **Blink responses**: Either absent or showing prolonged ipsilateral R1 and R2 responses, and contralateral R2 response.

### Skeletal muscle in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^115znSBt]. Brain (2023). High credibility.

Skeletal muscle pathology is an important aspect to consider when understanding amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). An undisputed fact is that skeletal muscle of patients with ALS is subject to chronic neurogenic changes, similar to other diseases of peripheral motor nerve loss, but contrasting with primary muscle diseases. It is thus clear that a large part of muscle alterations related to ALS occur subsequent to motor neuron (MN) degeneration.

This is illustrated by early clinical neurophysiological investigations on patients with ALS, such as the classic study by Erminio et al. in 1959 that characterized motor unit territories of patients with peripheral nerve injury and ALS. In contrast to modern electromyography (EMG), this study employed a novel needle electrode in which 14 active recording ports were placed 2.5 mm apart along the shaft of the needle. The needle was 1 mm in diameter and inserted orthogonal to the long axis of muscle fibers, making this a heroic study for participants.

Participants were asked to contract the muscle in question. An attempt was made to localize the needle so the middle electrode displayed activity of a single motor unit producing larger amplitude waveforms than the neighboring electrodes, which recorded from the same MN at varying distances from its motor point. In this way, both the maximum electrical amplitude and the spatial extent of the motor unit potential (MUP) could be examined. Figure 2A shows the pattern seen for four motor units from patients with ALS, judged from severe to mild, along with a MUP from a normal subject. The ALS patient MUP was, in general, higher in amplitude.

### Optimizing measurement of the electrical anisotropy of muscle [^116YA1sc]. Muscle & Nerve (2008). Low credibility.

Skeletal muscle is electrically anisotropic, with high-frequency electrical flow more easily occurring along muscle fibers rather than across them. As an initial step in exploiting this characteristic for clinical purposes, we studied approaches for maximizing measured anisotropy by varying electrode size and applied frequency in the tibialis anterior of 10 normal subjects. The results were compared with those from two patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

The electrical current was applied percutaneously, first parallel and then perpendicular to the major fiber direction of the muscle, at frequencies ranging from 20 kHz to 1 MHz, using a fixed voltage-electrode length and varying the current-electrode length. The measured anisotropy was most pronounced using the longest length electrodes and with a 125 kHz applied frequency for the major outcome parameter, phase. Additionally, the two ALS patients exhibited very distinct anisotropic patterns. These results support the belief that, with the appropriate measurement technique, non-invasive assessment of muscle electrical anisotropy may have valuable clinical applications.

### AAPM&R consensus guidance on spasticity assessment and management [^111VXEV9]. PM&R (2024). High credibility.

The 2024 guidelines from the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (AAPM&R) recommend assessing the impact of spasticity on passive and active movement, the ability to repeat movements, and function during the initial evaluation of patients with muscle spasticity.

### One nerve suffices: A clinically guided nerve ultrasound protocol for the differentiation of multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [^114BynH4]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

The table displaying muscle functions attributed to nerves/nerve roots is no longer present. It originally illustrated the distribution of the most heavily affected nerves/nerve roots according to muscle function testing, divided by study groups. The table detailed the attribution of muscle functions to specific nerves/nerve roots, forming the basis for clinical decisions concerning the nervous structure in individual patients with the heaviest associated clinical deficits. Only single muscle functions unequivocally attributable to a specific nervous structure were considered, excluding nerve roots.

The numbers (percentages) indicated the frequency with which respective nerves/nerve roots were associated with the heaviest clinical deficit according to single muscle testing by MRC-SS, separated for all study groups. Summed percentages surpassed 100% because several patients presented heaviest muscle deficits in multiple single muscles attributed to different nerves.

- **Significant findings in cohort I**: The C7 nerve root (p = .038) and radial nerve (p = .022, Fisher's exact test for both) were significantly more often associated with the most pronounced clinical deficit in MMN. Additionally, a trend was observed across both cohorts for the peroneal nerve to be more often selected in ALS/LMND patients than in MMN patients.

### French Society of ENT (SFORL) guidelines: Management of acute Bell's palsy [^116KDJMy]. European Annals of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Bell's palsy, specifically in relation to electrodiagnostic testing, the SFORL 2020 guidelines recommend refraining from performing electroneuromyography before day 8. This recommendation is due to the poor prognostic value of the results, which are also reported to be poorly reproducible.

### Is needle electromyography safe in patients on anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy [^115tpGk7]. Nature Clinical Practice Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Needle electromyography (EMG) is a valuable diagnostic tool in the evaluation of the peripheral nervous system. However, the risk of complications with this procedure in patients on anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications is unknown. Guidelines recommend caution when performing needle EMG in patients with disturbances of hemostasis because of the risks of intramuscular hemorrhage or other bleeding. This commentary reviews a study by Lynch et al. that investigated the risk of hematoma formation following needle EMG of the tibialis anterior muscle in 158 patients on antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications.

The authors used a standardized approach to the needle examination, followed by the application of direct pressure to the insertion site after removal of the needle. Three hematomas were detected — two in patients on warfarin, and one in a patient taking clopidogrel. None of the patients had symptomatic bleeding. These results indicate that the risk of hematoma formation is low following needle EMG when direct pressure is applied after removal of the needle.

### A protocol to develop clinical guidelines for inclusion-body myositis [^115uo9cW]. Muscle & nerve (2016). Low credibility.

The agreeing upon expert opinion process will be led by the GDG lead and coordinator, who will initiate a 3-round consultation process by proposing possible statements corresponding to the clinical questions raised by the section steering committees. These statements will be presented to section steering committees in the context of findings from the literature review. To encourage wider expert participation, specialists from other sections of the GDG will be invited to join the consultation, and the section steering committees will also be invited to nominate additional experts from outside of the GDG. The steering committees' prior completion of collaborative critical appraisal is expected to optimize the quality and accountability of expert agreed-upon recommendations.

- **Delphi-type approach**: A Delphi-type consultation will produce recommendation statements that are (1) consensually agreed upon by an expert panel and (2) based on individual, anonymous evaluation. The method proposed assesses the necessity of statements, allowing statements to be added or removed. Moreover, the strength of each included statement is evaluated implicitly according to the level of expert agreement and uncertainty. This Delphi-type approach and the percentage cut-offs used are partly modeled on consultations conducted previously to select outcome measures and to develop quality assessment tools. Guidance on the wording of statements included in the consultation will be provided before each round of consultation.

- **Post-consultation review**: After the consultation process, there will be a review of the statements to ensure accuracy and alignment with the objectives of the clinical guidelines being developed.

### Electromyography-related pain: Muscle selection is the key modifiable study characteristic [^112YwSYc]. Muscle & Nerve (2014). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to estimate the effects of patient, provider, and study characteristics on electromyography (EMG)-related pain.

- **Methods**: Patients undergoing EMG rated their EMG-related pain after each muscle was studied on a 100-point visual analog scale (VAS). Investigators recorded the order in which the muscles were sampled, the total time spent with the needle in each muscle, and whether electrical endplate noise was noted.

- **Results**: A total of 1781 muscles were studied in 304 patients. Eleven muscles were associated with significantly more or less pain than the others. Endplate noise was associated with more pain (5.4 mm, 95% CI 2.8–7.0). There was a small, but significant effect from needling time (0.02 mm, 95% CI 0.00–0.04).

- **Conclusions**: Among factors that electromyographers can control, muscle selection has the greatest impact on pain. Our data include an extensive list of muscle-specific EMG-related pain scores. Provider and other study characteristics have little or no impact on EMG-related pain.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (update) [^114JJPpq]. The Spine Journal (2013). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for lumbar spinal stenosis, specifically with respect to EMG, the NASS 2013 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against the use of F wave, H reflex, motor-evoked potential, motor nerve conduction studies, somatosensory-evoked potentials, dermatomal sensory-evoked potentials, and lower extremity electromyography for the confirmation of lumbar spinal stenosis. Consider obtaining these studies to help identify other comorbidities.

### Fasciculation analysis reveals a novel parameter that correlates with predicted survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^116XDM2E]. Muscle & Nerve (2021). Low credibility.

Prognostic uncertainty in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) confounds clinical management planning, patient counseling, and trial stratification. Fasciculations are an early clinical hallmark of the disease and can be quantified noninvasively. Using an innovative analytical method, we correlated novel fasciculation parameters with a predictive survival model.

- **Methods**: Using high-density surface electromyography, we collected biceps recordings from ALS patients on their first research visit. By accessing an online survival prediction tool, we provided eight clinical and genetic parameters to estimate individual patient survival. Fasciculation analysis was performed using an automated algorithm (Surface Potential Quantification Engine), with a Cox proportional hazards model to calculate hazard ratios.

- **Results**: The median predicted survival for 31 patients was 41 (interquartile range, 31.5–57) months. Univariate hazard ratios were 1.09 (95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.16) for the rate of change of fasciculation frequency (RoCoFF) and 1.10 (95% CI, 1.01–1.19) for the amplitude dispersion rate. Only the RoCoFF remained significant (P = .04) in a multivariate model.

- **Discussion**: Noninvasive measurement of fasciculations at a single time-point could enhance prognostic models in ALS, where higher RoCoFF values indicate shorter survival.

### Innervation zone locations in 43 superficial muscles: Toward a standardization of electrode positioning [^116Ti2sy]. Muscle & Nerve (2014). Low credibility.

We describe the innervation zone (IZ) location in 43 muscles to provide information for appropriate positioning of bipolar electrodes for clinical and research applications.

- **Methods**: The IZ was studied in 40 subjects (20 men and 20 women) using multichannel surface electromyography (sEMG). Signal quality was checked visually to identify motor unit action potentials and estimate muscle fiber conduction velocity.

- **Results**: Results in 33 muscles were classified as excellent or good because it was possible to identify a favorable area for appropriate positioning of an electrode pair without the need to previously determine the IZ location.

- **Conclusions**: Knowledge of IZ location will increase standardization and repeatability of sEMG measures.

### Techniques and applications of EMG: Measuring motor units from structure to function [^1142N3Wj]. Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Needle electromyography (EMG) is an established method of evaluating motor unit and muscle fibre function and pathology in clinical practice. The development of advanced techniques, including single-fibre EMG and combined recordings with other modalities, has become increasingly useful in research. The development of quantitative EMG in particular has led to greater reproducibility and inter-rater reliability. This review provides an overview of standard needle EMG as well as discussing advanced recording and analysis techniques and their increasing role in clinical research.

### Development and preliminary validation of an electromyography-scoring protocol for the assessment and grading of muscle involvement in patients with juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies [^1173rrnL]. Pediatric Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

We performed a pilot study in order to investigate the feasibility of an electromyography (EMG)-scoring protocol for the assessment of disease activity in juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (JIIM).

- **Methods**: Children with JIIM followed up in a tertiary-level care center underwent standardized clinical, laboratory, and EMG assessments. An EMG-scoring protocol was devised by a consensus panel including a pediatric neurophysiologist and two pediatric rheumatologists. The protocol was based on a combined score obtained as the sum of: (1) the presence of denervation signs (fibrillation potentials) and (2) motor unit remodeling (a mixed pattern of short- and long-duration motor unit action potentials). The EMG-scoring protocol was validated following the Outcome Measures in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials filter for outcome measures in rheumatology and the consensus-based standards for the selection of health measurement instruments methodology.

- **Results**: Thirteen children (77% females) were included in the study, with a median age of 10 years (interquartile range: 7–17 years) and median disease duration of 11.8 months (interquartile range: 2.1–44.5). A total of 39 EMG examinations were evaluated. A strong positive association between a standardized tool for muscle strength assessment and the combined score was observed. No significant associations were found with creatine kinase and erythrocyte sedimentation rate levels.

- **Discussion**: Our EMG-scoring protocol is the first standardized and reproducible tool for the neurophysiologic evaluation and grading of muscle involvement in patients with JIIM.

### Electromyography evaluation of bodyweight exercise progression in a validated anterior cruciate ligament injury rehabilitation program: A cross-sectional study [^117KVjYs]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2019). Low credibility.

In 2004, Risberg et al. provided an evidence-based review of the effectiveness of various rehabilitation programs used for surgically or non-surgically treated ACL injuries in adult patients. The review emphasized that although all lower extremity muscles must be included in rehabilitation after ACL injury or reconstruction, particular attention must be paid to strengthening the quadriceps, as it is the most affected muscle in these situations. In our study, a significant increase in quadriceps muscle activity from one phase to the next was observed, implying that bodyweight exercises were successfully progressed in the current rehabilitation protocol. Furthermore, in phase 3, both the vastus lateralis (VL) and vastus medialis (VM) reached activity levels high enough to stimulate strength gains (i.e. > 60% nEMG). This indicates that the key goal of the late rehabilitation phase — to achieve substantial strength gains — is achievable with the present bodyweight exercises. There is consensus that vastus medialis oblique (VMO) activation and active knee extension are essential in ACL rehabilitation. In respect to this, all exercises in phase 3 induced quadriceps activity levels exceeding 60% nEMG, with significant VM dominance (i.e. 27–34 percentage points higher activity than VL).

- **Limitations**: This study has several limitations. The present study evaluated the exercises in healthy athletes, so we cannot conclude that the findings can be generalized to ACL patients. However, the present EMG evaluation could be considered a healthy reference material for comparison.

### A shortened surface electromyography recording is sufficient to facilitate home fasciculation assessment [^114J6T1X]. Muscle & Nerve (2022). Low credibility.

Fasciculations are an early clinical hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), amenable to detection by high-density surface electromyography (HDSEMG). In conjunction with the Surface Potential Quantification Engine (SPiQE), HDSEMG offers improved spatial resolution for the analysis of fasciculations. This study aims to establish an optimal recording duration to enable longitudinal remote monitoring in the home.

- **Methods**: Twenty patients with ALS and five patients with benign fasciculation syndrome (BFS) underwent serial 30-minute HDSEMG recordings from biceps brachii and gastrocnemii. SPiQE was independently applied to abbreviated epochs within each 30-minute recording (0–5, 0–10, 0–15, 0–20, and 0–25 minutes), outputting fasciculation frequency, amplitude median, and amplitude interquartile range. Bland-Altman plots and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were used to assess agreement with the validated 30-minute recording.

- **Results**: In total, 506 full recordings were included. The 5-minute recordings demonstrated diverse and relatively poor agreement with the 30-minute baselines across all parameters, muscles, and patient groups (ICC = 0.32–0.86). The 15-minute recordings provided more acceptable and stable agreement (ICC = 0.78–0.98), which did not substantially improve in longer recordings.

- **Discussion**: For the detection and quantification of fasciculations in patients with ALS and BFS, HDSEMG recordings can be halved from 30 to 15 minutes without significantly compromising the primary outputs. Reliance on a shorter recording duration should lead to improved tolerability.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for muscle cramps, specifically in the context of initial evaluation of muscle spasticity, the AAPM&R 2024 guidelines recommend reassessing spasticity throughout the treatment course. This reassessment should occur particularly before or at the time of each treatment to determine whether to maintain or modify the treatment.

### Macro electromyography, an update [^116o73pP]. Muscle & Nerve (2011). Low credibility.

The macro electromyography method was developed in the 1980s. Since then, technical modifications have been made, and a number of conditions have been explored. This study is a methodological introduction and an update of findings in some nerve-muscle disorders. The spike component of a motor unit potential (MUP) recorded by a concentric or monopolar needle electromyography (EMG) electrode is generated primarily by fibers within 1–2 mm of the needle recording area. Given that a MUP's typical anatomical reach is 5–15 mm in diameter, it follows that conventional EMG is unable to record activity from the entire motor unit. Such information could promote understanding of muscle in health and disease. Macro EMG, with its large recording area, appears to provide this information by recording the activity from most of the fibers in a given motor unit. The value of combining macro EMG with single-fiber EMG and conventional EMG recordings is discussed.

### Motor unit recruitment and bursts of activity in the surface electromyogram during a sustained contraction [^111JRmPT]. Muscle & nerve (2008). Low credibility.

Bursts of activity in the surface electromyogram (EMG) during a sustained contraction have been interpreted as corresponding to the transient recruitment of motor units, but this association has never been confirmed. The study compared the timing of trains of action potentials discharged by single motor units during a sustained contraction with the bursts of activity detected in the surface EMG signal.

The 20 motor units from six subjects [recruitment threshold, 35.3 ± 11.3% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) force] that were detected with fine wire electrodes discharged 2–9 trains of action potentials (7.2 ± 5.6 s in duration) when recruited during a contraction sustained at a force below its recruitment threshold (target force, 25.4 ± 10.6% MVC force). High-pass filtering the bipolar surface EMG signal improved its correlation with the single motor unit signal. An algorithm applied to the surface EMG was able to detect 75% of the trains of motor unit action potentials.

The results indicate that bursts of activity in the surface EMG during a constant-force contraction correspond to the transient recruitment of higher-threshold motor units in healthy individuals. These results could assist in the diagnosis and design of treatment in individuals who demonstrate deficits in motor unit activation.

### Cramps, muscle pain, and fasciculations: Not always benign [^114X95To]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Fasciculation and cramps without weakness or muscle atrophy are recognized as a benign syndrome. The authors report a patient with cramp and fasciculation, which persisted for one year without abnormal motor unit morphology on EMG, before progressive weakness, muscle atrophy, and EMG abnormalities developed. This observation raises the possibility that lower motor neuron hyperexcitability may precede motor neuron death in motor neuron disease.

### Role of EMG evaluation in muscle hyperactivity syndromes [^113ZjfBf]. Journal of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Muscle hyperactivity can be a clinical feature on its own or, more commonly, an observation on electromyography (EMG) examinations. Whatever manifestation it takes, muscle hyperactivity always indicates enhanced excitability of muscle, axons, or neurons. Clinical findings may vary, ranging from fasciculations to muscle cramps. Even though clinical examinations can generally suggest the diagnosis of the underlying disease, EMG studies are necessary to identify the type of abnormal discharges and propose the site of their suspected origin.

While clinical studies often record the action potential showing abnormal muscle hyperactivity from muscle fibers, the site where the impulse has arisen determines its shape and firing patterns. In this review, we explore the EMG characteristics observed in syndromes featuring muscle hyperactivity and the pathophysiology underlying the abnormal firing of muscle fibers.

### Excitability properties of motor axons in patients with spontaneous motor unit activity [^115i9JHD]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Measures of nerve excitability provide information about the biophysical properties of peripheral axons in disease states. One measure, the strength-duration time constant (tau(SD)), was previously reported to be prolonged in the motor axons of patients with acquired neuromyotonia. This study used a new protocol that applies a more comprehensive and sensitive panel of measures of axonal excitability. The objectives were, firstly, to determine whether changes in tau(SD) were present in patients with evidence of spontaneous motor unit activity; and secondly, if such changes in tau(SD) were present, to examine whether other parameters of axonal excitability were affected in order to clarify the mechanism of the change in tau(SD).

Eleven patients with both symptoms and EMG evidence of spontaneous motor unit activity were studied. Eight patients had autoimmune-associated acquired neuromyotonia (aNMT), and three had the cramp fasciculation syndrome. The protocol first measured stimulus-response behavior using two stimulus durations, from which the distribution of strength-duration time constants was estimated. Threshold tracking was then used to determine threshold electrotonus to 100 ms polarizing currents, a current-threshold relation (indicating inward and outward rectification), and the recovery of excitability after supramaximal activation.

The results were compared with previously published normal data. The value for tau(SD) of motor axons in the patient group was 0.43 (0.02) ms (mean (SEM)), identical to the control value. Most other indices of axonal excitability were consistent with these findings.

### Can regional spreading of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis motor symptoms be explained by prion-like propagation [^111x3n1V]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Different motor neurons may have varying vulnerabilities. In a three-dimensional study of the distribution of anterior horn cells in the cervical eighth segment of the human spinal cord, obtained at autopsy from patients with ALS, zones of focal and patchy loss of motor neurons were identified without consistent severity or distribution at different sectional levels. According to the investigators, these findings imply that different pools of motor neurons have varying resistance to disease.

In limb onset cases, the initial symptoms present most commonly in distal muscles. In an analysis of 1,200 patients, Haverkamp et al. found that 73% of non-bulbar patients first exhibited symptoms in the distal portions of the limbs. In 24 autopsies of ALS patients, Tsukagoshi et al. found more marked anterior horn cell loss at the eighth cervical segment, which mainly innervates the distal hand muscles, than at the sixth cervical segment innervating more proximal upper limb muscles.

The distal predominance in the initial symptoms does not necessarily reflect only axon length dependent vulnerability, as bulbar and lower limb onset occur at the same frequency. By using quantitative concentric needle EMG in the early stages of ALS, de Carvalho et al. showed that similar abnormalities in motor unit potentials (MUPs) were found in paraspinal and limb muscles in the same spinal segment. This was true for both the sixth cervical segment and the fifth lumbar segment, although fasciculation potentials were more frequent in limb muscles than in paraspinal muscles, and fibrillations were most frequent in the…

### European Academy of Neurology/peripheral nerve society guideline on diagnosis and treatment of Guillain-Barré syndrome [^1136ywbo]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Guillain-Barré syndrome, specifically concerning electrodiagnostic testing, the EAN/PNS 2023 guidelines recommend assessing the following additional electrodiagnostic features (which possess low-to-moderate sensitivity but high specificity) to support the diagnosis of GBS:

- **Sural sparing pattern**: Abnormal median or ulnar sensory nerve action potential with normal sural nerve sensory nerve action potential, after excluding carpal tunnel syndrome.

- **Indirect discharges**: Often multiple, resembling A-waves, and distinct from F-waves.

- **Distal compound muscle action potential duration prolongation > 8.5 ms**: Time from onset of first negative deflection to return to baseline of last negative deflection, using a filter bandpass of 2–10 kHz.

### Bioelectrical activity of the pelvic floor muscles during synchronous whole-body vibration — a randomized controlled study [^111GGVed]. BMC Urology (2015). High credibility.

An analysis of raw pelvic floor EMG data revealed significantly lower values of absolute mean amplitude and mean and median frequency in women with weakened pelvic floor muscles compared to healthy participants. The authors believe that such results are due to decreased muscle fiber recruitment and synchronization, as well as low muscle strength and power in postpartum women. Luginbuehl et al. demonstrated no significant change in the value of amplitude and median frequency of the EMG during stochastic resonance whole body vibration. According to the authors, it can be due to no more than moderate to submaximal PFM activity during stochastic resonance whole body vibration.

Pelvic floor muscle fatigue has been investigated by several other authors. It was also evaluated based on changes in vaginal pressure during MVC measurement, perineal ultrasound to assess bladder neck motility, time-to-fatigue test with a relative force of 80%, and the Borg Scale of Perceived Exertion.

The neuromuscular system alters the recruitment strategies and motor unit firing frequencies during prolonged fatiguing contractions. A single 90-second vibration session in young healthy women was probably not sufficient to cause pelvic floor muscle fatigue in this experiment.

Our study has several limitations, including a relatively small number of study participants. Additionally, we could not compare the results with incontinent women as no comparison group had been formed. Finally, we did not measure the actually generated vibration parameters and skidding of the feet as recommended by the International Society of M.

### Non-hospitalized patients with post-COVID condition and myopathic electromyography findings show no difference in symptom severity and clinical manifestations compared to those without myopathic findings [^112CfpSg]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

In clinical practice, qualitative and quantitative EMG is used to identify and analyze myopathic MUPs, characterized by brief duration, increased polyphasia, decreased amplitude, and early recruitment. It is important to note that the presence of MUPs with myopathic morphology alone does not provide a definitive diagnosis of clinical myopathy, and we cannot rule out the possibility that myopathic EMG findings may have been present in at least some patients before their SARS-CoV-2 infection or may have been unrelated to PCC. However, in the absence of an underlying neuropathy, brief-duration polyphasic MUPs were interpreted as representing myopathic findings. Furthermore, we previously performed the same methodology with the same equipment and medical staff, as well as a blind analysis, and observed only one person with myopathic EMG findings in the control group, which supports the accuracy of our methodology. However, it is crucial to critically evaluate and correlate myopathic EMG findings with clinical symptoms, as differences in PCC symptom duration, muscle severity, viral variants, and systemic inflammation can complicate interpretation across studies. In our study, all patients were vaccinated and we included patients across different outbreaks (COVID infection from March 2020 to December 2022); however, further information about viral variants, number of vaccinations, and whether post-COVID symptoms first developed before or after vaccination are not available.

Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that central mechanisms, including altered cortical excitability and

### Electrodiagnostic assessment of peri-procedural iatrogenic peripheral nerve injuries and rehabilitation [^112ngR7z]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Initial well-designed consultation for suspected injuries should ideally be completed within 4–8 weeks. Providers may be reluctant to refer patients to medicine specialists for evaluation due to concerns of malpractice implications, costs, time, and the likelihood of spontaneous recovery. By four weeks, static axonal injuries with Wallerian degeneration should be diagnosable.

To optimize recovery outcomes, multidisciplinary teams, including but not limited to medicine specialists, physiatrists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and peripheral nerve surgeons, may be assembled to expedite rehabilitation and surgical interventions. This assembly aims to improve outcomes. If testing can identify the firing of at least one motor unit potential upon attempts to voluntarily contract a muscle innervated by a nerve across the suspected lesion location, the injury is incomplete. Therefore, surgical intervention or exploration is less likely to be beneficial, especially in the acute stage.

When there are only one or two functioning motor units, a large portion of the motor unit pool may be lost (> 90% for the facial nerve), and terminal sprouting may be insufficient to compensate for the resulting functional loss. In this situation, axon regrowth (not just sprouting) will likely be needed to achieve adequate motor recovery to regain function. In proximal lesions, axon regrowth may not be sufficient to reach distal targets, leading to a poor prognosis for recovery.

Electrodiagnostic (EDX) study design considerations may aid interpretation when trying to identify possible neurotmesis.

### Utility of trapezius EMG for diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^116KFbqY]. Muscle & Nerve (2009). Low credibility.

Needle electromyography (EMG) of the tongue is traditionally used as a key to the diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), although relaxation of the tongue is often difficult to achieve. Recently, frequent abnormalities in the EMGs of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) and upper trapezius muscles in ALS have been reported. To elucidate the diagnostic utility of these muscles, we performed a multicenter prospective study to examine EMGs of the tongue (genioglossus), SCM, and trapezius in 104 ALS or suspected ALS patients. We also examined EMGs of the SCM and trapezius in 32 cervical spondylosis (CS) patients.

We mainly evaluated fibrillation potentials/positive sharp waves (Fib/PSWs) and fasciculation potentials. Complete relaxation was achieved in 85% of ALS patients in the trapezius, but in only 6% of patients in the tongue. Fib/PSWs were observed in 8%, 13%, and 45% of ALS patients in the tongue, SCM, and trapezius, respectively, whereas fasciculation potentials were observed in 1%, 7%, and 39%, respectively. Abnormal spontaneous activity of any type was found in 9%, 17%, and 63% of patients, respectively.

The high frequency of abnormal spontaneous activity in the trapezius was similar among the different diagnostic categories, and even 72% of clinically suspected ALS (progressive muscular atrophy) patients showed them in their trapezius. We did not observe Fib/PSWs or fasciculation potentials in any of our CS patients, thus these findings have excellent specificity. Tongue EMG added little utility over the clinical sign of tongue atrophy.

### Imaging muscle as a potential biomarker of denervation in motor neuron disease [^114htCrc]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Regions of interest were contoured manually according to the standardized anatomical landmarks (see online supplementary file 1) on single unprocessed coronal slices. This process was in line with previous studies and used a semiautomated spline function provided in the system manufacturer's online workstation (Extended MR Workspace V.2.6.3.5, Philips Healthcare).

Intrarater and inter-rater reproducibility were confirmed by two independent raters. They achieved coefficients of variation < 5% for all regions of interest on six practice datasets performed at least 24 hours apart. Final contouring was conducted by a single blinded operator (TMJ), and mean T2 signal estimates were derived for multiple areas: the tongue, right and left biceps, right and left thoracic paraspinals, right and left anterolateral leg compartments encompassing TA, second cervical vertebral body, right humerus, and right tibia. Individual anterolateral leg compartment muscle boundaries are not readily distinguishable on coronal MR, but TA predominates and is used for brevity in the remainder of this manuscript.

Muscle region of interest T2 values were expressed relative to those obtained from bone within the same station (tongue:second cervical vertebral body, biceps:humerus, paraspinals:humerus, and TA:tibia). A mean paraspinal muscle estimate was used for all analyses, except where otherwise specified, to ensure the thoracic domain was represented by a single parameter, in accordance with El Escorial criteria. All scans were reviewed by a consultant neuroradiologist (NH), and incidental findings were reported back to study participants.

### Combining electromyography and Raman spectroscopy: Optical EMG [^114XPPaj]. Muscle & Nerve (2023). High credibility.

Electromyography (EMG) remains a key component of the diagnostic work-up for suspected neuromuscular disease, but it does not provide insight into the molecular composition of muscle which can provide diagnostic information. Raman spectroscopy is an emerging neuromuscular biomarker capable of generating highly specific molecular fingerprints of tissue. Here, we present "optical EMG", a combination of EMG and Raman spectroscopy, achieved using a single needle.

- **Methods**: An optical EMG needle was created to collect electrophysiological and Raman spectroscopic data during a single insertion. We tested functionality with in vivo recordings in the SOD1 G93A mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), using both transgenic (n = 10) and non-transgenic (NTg, n = 7) mice. Under anesthesia, compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs), spontaneous EMG activity, and Raman spectra were recorded from both gastrocnemius muscles with the optical EMG needle. Standard concentric EMG needle recordings were also undertaken. Electrophysiological data were analyzed with standard univariate statistics, and Raman data with both univariate and multivariate analyses.

- **Results**: A significant difference in CMAP amplitude was observed between SOD1 G93A and NTg mice with optical EMG and standard concentric needles (p = .015 and p = .011, respectively). Spontaneous EMG activity (positive sharp waves) was detected in transgenic SOD1 G93A mice only. Raman spectra demonstrated peaks associated with key muscle components and highlighted significant differences in molecular composition between SOD1 G93A and NTg.

### Muscle ultrasound: Present state and future opportunities [^112pTATa]. Muscle & Nerve (2021). Low credibility.

The optimal scan time for detecting fasciculations has been found to be 30‐60 seconds, similar to EMG. As a caveat, fasciculations of low amplitude on EMG (< 1 mV) and a simple morphology with a maximum of four phases on EMG could be missed with ultrasound, as a recent study by Bokuda et al. showed. It is thought that these fasciculations occur in muscles that are just at the beginning of denervation.

With the right equipment and settings, even fibrillations can be detected with ultrasound. A high‐resolution linear ultrasound probe with a frequency range of 5‐17 MHz will have a lateral resolution around 0.1‐0.3 mm. Normal muscle fibers are around 0.04‐0.06 mm in diameter, and atrophic denervated ones will likely be smaller. Several fibers need to fibrillate and move simultaneously to be seen by the probe. Fibrillations last about 50–100 μs, so using a frame rate of 20 Hz it takes at least five fibrillations per second to cause enough displacement to be visible on screen. Just as for needle EMG, the occurrence of fibrillating muscle fibers is very temperature dependent, with a 30% decrease in their presence when the temperature is lowered from 39°C to 30°C.

### Comparison of the diagnostic accuracy of the 2010 European Federation of Neurological Societies/Peripheral Nerve Society and American Association of Electrodiagnostic Medicine diagnostic criteria for multifocal motor neuropathy [^114uu7pL]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is a rare acquired motor neuropathy characterized by progressive multifocal or asymmetric weakness without sensory symptoms and signs. It typically affects the upper limbs more than the lower limbs. Electrodiagnostic studies reveal an asymmetric motor neuropathy with characteristic conduction block (CB). Serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) antiganglioside (anti-GM1) antibodies are present in approximately 50% of patients. Its nosological characterization is relatively recent, dating back to 1988.

Unlike some motor neuropathies, MMN is treatable with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). Untreated patients are likely to experience progressive muscle weakness that may result in serious functional impairment and reduced quality of life, making early diagnosis crucial. Since its nosological characterization, numerous sets of diagnostic criteria have been proposed for MMN. In the absence of a pathognomonic diagnostic biomarker, diagnosis still relies on clinical manifestations and nerve conduction studies, possibly supported by some additional diagnostic examinations.

Multifocal CB in motor nerves, occurring outside typical sites of nerve compression, remains the key instrumental and pathological hallmark of MMN. CB can be defined as the focal failure of a nerve impulse to propagate along a structurally intact axon. The CB observed in MMN is distinctive in that it exclusively affects motor fibers, whereas sensory conduction remains normal through the same nerve segment. There remains a debate regarding whether the decrease in the area or…

### Ultrasound-guided motor unit scanning electromyography [^114VN5hE]. Muscle & Nerve (2022). Low credibility.

Conventional needle electromyography (EMG) records the motor unit potential (MUP), which is the spatially summated electrical activity from muscle fibers within the vicinity of the needle tip. With appropriate filter settings, information on local fiber density can be obtained, but the dimensions of the motor unit (MU) and its internal structure cannot be determined. Several techniques have been developed to address this lack of spatial information, including multielectrodes, paired needle insertions, and, more recently, MU magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Perhaps the best known of these is scanning EMG, where a concentric needle electrode is withdrawn through an MU in fixed increments to build a continuous representation of electrical activity within a corridor of the MU.

Scanning EMG has been used to measure MU territory in muscular dystrophy, as well as MU territory and temporal dispersion in neurogenic and myogenic disease. Most studies using scanning EMG demonstrated no changes in MU territory size in either myogenic or neurogenic disease, with one exception showing a significant increase in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle in patients with neurogenic disease. In contrast, notable internal structural changes within the MU have been shown in both disease groups, including fragmentation and increased polyphasic segments.

Scanning EMG has some limitations. First, it requires the insertion of two needles into the muscle and specialized equipment (computer-controlled stepper motor), increasing the time taken and limiting its availability.

### Perseris [^111BA5xR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Symptoms of dystonia, which are prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. Although these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first-generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia has been observed in males and younger age groups.

- **Changes in ECG**: In the 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study, there were no clinically relevant differences in mean changes from baseline to end of study in ECG parameters, including QTcF (Fridericia's corrected QT interval), QRS and PR intervals, and heart rate, in patients in either Perseris treatment group (90 mg and 120 mg) compared with placebo. Similarly, in the 12-month, long-term safety study, there were no clinically relevant changes in mean ECG interval values from baseline to postdose assessments.

### Needle electromyography [^1115fNVp]. Muscle & Nerve (2009). Low credibility.

The physiologic assessment of diseases affecting the motor unit, from the anterior horn cells to the muscles, relies on a combination of needle electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS). Conducting these assessments effectively requires a unique combination of knowledge, including the anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology of the peripheral nervous system, as well as an understanding of related diseases, techniques, and electrical principles. Successful, high-quality, and reproducible EMG results depend on the clinician's skill in patient interaction during the needle's physical insertion and movement while recording electrical signals. This must be complemented by the ability to analyze the electrical signals recorded from muscles through auditory pattern recognition and semiquantitation. This monograph reviews the techniques of needle EMG and waveform analysis and describes the types of EMG waveforms recorded during needle EMG.

### Effects of intramuscular needle position on motor unit action potential metrics [^114Xysyg]. Muscle & Nerve (2007). Low credibility.

It is unclear whether there are clinically significant differences in amplitude, duration, and numbers of turns and phases if an electromyographic (EMG) study is performed near to, or far from, the end-plate zone. The effects of temporal dispersion of arriving muscle-fiber action potentials on quantitative motor unit action potential (MUAP) metrics were assessed in simulated and biologic muscles.

Two muscle simulation models were studied with electrode recording positions near the motor end-plate zone and 50–75 mm away. When the electrode was moved away from the end-plate zone, averages of 20 MUAPs significantly decreased in amplitude and area, and increased in numbers of turns and phases, but there was no significant change in duration. In biologic muscles (both normal and pathologic), similar changes in average metrics were observed, but to lesser degrees; few were statistically significant.

Zones of innervation in biologic muscles are broadly distributed and, during routine electrode studies, distances between random electrode placements and end-plate zones are therefore relatively short, leading to clinically insignificant changes in quantitative MUAP metrics with distance from the end-plate zone. Thus, electrode position within a muscle is unlikely to affect clinical MUAP interpretation.

### Phenomenology and classification of dystonia: A consensus update [^1169wzAz]. Movement Disorders (2013). High credibility.

This report describes the consensus outcome of an international panel consisting of investigators with years of experience in this field who reviewed the definition and classification of dystonia. Agreement was obtained using a consensus development methodology during three in-person meetings and manuscript review by mail. Dystonia is defined as a movement disorder characterized by sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal, often repetitive, movements, postures, or both. Dystonic movements are typically patterned and twisting, and may be tremulous. Dystonia is often initiated or worsened by voluntary action and associated with overflow muscle activation.

- **Classification**: Dystonia is classified along two axes: clinical characteristics, including age at onset, body distribution, temporal pattern, and associated features (additional movement disorders or neurological features); and etiology, which includes nervous system pathology and inheritance. The clinical characteristics fall into several specific dystonia syndromes that help to guide diagnosis and treatment.

We provide here a new general definition of dystonia and propose a new classification. We encourage clinicians and researchers to use these innovative definitions and classifications and to test them in the clinical setting on a variety of patients with dystonia. © 2013 Movement Disorder Society.

### Detecting fasciculations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: Duration of observation required [^114Z6AMV]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

A practical issue in the diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is determining how long the EMG must be observed before a muscle can be declared free of fasciculations with some degree of certainty. To answer this question, the intervals between fasciculation potentials (FPs) were recorded from 53 muscles of 19 ALS patients. The distribution of the FP intervals found across the sample showed that to record a single fasciculation with a probability approaching unity, observation for up to 90 s may be required.

### The value of multiple tests of respiratory muscle strength [^116f4Qzr]. Thorax (2007). Low credibility.

Respiratory muscle weakness is an important clinical problem. Tests of varying complexity and invasiveness are available to assess respiratory muscle strength. The relative precision of different tests in the detection of weakness is less clear, as is the value of multiple tests.

- **Methods**: The respiratory muscle function tests of clinical referrals who had multiple tests assessed in our laboratories over a 6-year period were analyzed. Thresholds for weakness for each test were determined from published and in-house laboratory data. The patients were divided into three groups: those who had all relevant measurements of global inspiratory muscle strength (group A, n = 182); those with full assessment of diaphragm strength (group B, n = 264); and those for whom expiratory muscle strength was fully evaluated (group C, n = 60). The diagnostic outcome of each inspiratory, diaphragm, and expiratory muscle test, both singly and in combination, was studied, and the impact of using more than one test to detect weakness was calculated.

- **Results**: The clinical referrals were primarily for the evaluation of neuromuscular diseases and dyspnoea of unknown cause. A low maximal inspiratory mouth pressure (Pimax) was recorded in 40.1% of referrals in group A, while a low sniff nasal pressure (Sniff Pnasal) was recorded in 41.8% and a low sniff oesophageal pressure (Sniff Poes) in 37.9%. When assessing inspiratory strength with the combination of all three tests, 29.6% of patients had weakness. Using the two non-invasive tests (Pimax and Sniff Pnasal) in combination, a similar result was observed.

### CK-2127107 amplifies skeletal muscle response to nerve activation in humans [^111aiuqS]. Muscle & Nerve (2018). Low credibility.

- **Pharmacodynamic assessment — CY 5013**: The force-frequency relationship of tibialis anterior muscle contraction, elicited by transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the deep fibular nerve, was used to evaluate the pharmacodynamic response to CK-107 in CY 5013. The sponsor employed the same methods and statistical analyses previously used to evaluate tirasemtiv to assess the pharmacodynamic response to CK-107.

Each participant was fitted into an adjustable, rigid chair frame with integrated footplates incorporating a force sensor, and the right foot was strapped firmly to the footplate with the lower leg and knee immobilized. The chairs were constructed so that, when seated, the participant's knees were bent approximately 60°, and the ankle angle was fixed at 105° (shin to bottom of foot). A strain gauge containing a load cell (MLP-75; Transducer Techniques, Temecula, CA) coupled to the bottom of the footplate was used to measure dorsiflexion force.

An adhesive surface electrode (61–2510; ConMed, Utica, NY) fixed to the lateral aspect of the upper leg just below the head of the fibula acted as the cathode and delivered stimulation pulses transcutaneously to the deep fibular nerve. The anode was placed on the medial aspect of the knee. To identify optimal cathode placement, a handheld, nonadhesive electrode through which low-intensity stimulation pulses were delivered was used to activate the nerve without stimulating antagonistic muscle groups, as determined by palpation.

### Residual innervation of the pelvic floor muscles in people with motor-complete spinal cord injury [^113t16RG]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2020). Low credibility.

Individuals clinically classified as having a motor-complete spinal cord injury (mcSCI) should lack voluntary motor function below their injury level. Neurophysiological assessments using electromyography (EMG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have demonstrated, however, that persons with mcSCI retain limited cortical descending innervation and voluntary activation of muscles below their level of injury, including muscles of the trunk and lower limb. We explored the possibility of whether there is also preserved innervation of the pelvic floor muscles (PFM) in persons with mcSCI. The PFM are controlled by widespread cortical and subcortical areas and typically coactivated with trunk and gluteal muscles to maintain continence and regulate intra-abdominal pressure.

Nine mcSCI and eight control subjects participated in this cross-sectional study. Surface EMG was used to record activity in the PFM. Data were recorded while participants attempted various maneuvers of the trunk and pelvis. We also applied TMS at incrementing levels of intensity over the primary motor cortex area to record motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in the PFM. When performing the maneuvers, activation of the PFM was possible in all controls and the majority of SCI participants. However, the PFM were only activated in the SCI participants during maneuvers that engaged other trunk muscles. MEP responses in the PFM were also elicited in all controls and SCI participants, but MEP response characteristics were significantly altered in the SCI group.

Our results suggest that persons with mcSCI retain some level of innervation in the PFM.

### Botox [^111W5dPR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **General**: Dosing in initial and sequential treatment sessions should be tailored to the individual based on the size, number, and location of muscles involved, severity of spasticity, the presence of local muscle weakness, the patient's response to previous treatment, or adverse event history with Botox.

The recommended dilution is 200 Units/4 mL or 100 Units/2 mL with preservative-free 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. The lowest recommended starting dose should be used, and no more than 50 Units per site should generally be administered. An appropriately sized needle (e.g. 25–30 gauge) may be used for superficial muscles, and a longer 22 gauge needle may be used for deeper musculature. Localization of the involved muscles with techniques such as needle electromyographic guidance, nerve stimulation, or ultrasound is recommended.

Repeat Botox treatment may be administered when the effect of a previous injection has diminished, but generally no sooner than 12 weeks after the previous injection. The degree and pattern of muscle spasticity at the time of re-injection may necessitate alterations in the dose of Botox and muscles to be injected.

- **Adult upper limb spasticity**: In clinical trials, doses ranging from 75 Units to 400 Units were divided among selected muscles at a given treatment session (refer to figures as needed).

- **Adult lower limb spasticity**: The recommended dose for treating adult lower limb spasticity is 300 Units to 400 Units divided among 5 muscles.

### Assessment, management, and rehabilitation of traumatic peripheral nerve injuries for non-surgeons [^115SADm7]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). High credibility.

Moreover, to avoid surgery resulting in excessive donor morbidity, needle EMG evaluation of muscles that perform the same function as the potential donors can provide reassurance that the patient will not lose function as a result of surgery. For example, a patient with wrist and finger drops from a distal radial or posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) injury may be a candidate for supinator to PIN nerve transfer because the supinator muscle is often spared. EMG can ensure that the nerve injury does not affect the potential donor nerve to the supinator but also assess the other forearm supinator (biceps brachii), thereby confirming that supination will not be lost by the surgical intervention. Thus, EDX evaluation of the potential donor nerve(s) or muscles and of nerve(s) or muscles performing the same function as the putative donor(s) can ensure suitable donor selection and avoid functional loss.

### Can electromyography objectively detect voluntary movement in disorders of consciousness [^112VPTqW]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Determining conscious processing in unresponsive patients relies on subjective behavioral assessment. Using data from hand electromyography, the authors studied the occurrence of subthreshold muscle activity in response to verbal command as an objective indicator of awareness in 10 disorders of consciousness patients. One out of eight vegetative state patients and both minimally conscious patients (n = 2) demonstrated an increased electromyography signal specifically linked to command. These findings suggest electromyography could be used to assess awareness objectively in pathologies of consciousness.

### Dysport [^115M6zit]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Dosing in spasticity in adults**: Dosing in initial and subsequent treatment sessions should be tailored to the individual based on the size, number and location of muscles involved, severity of spasticity, the presence of local muscle weakness, the patient's response to previous treatment, and/or adverse reaction history with botulinum toxins. No more than 1 mL should generally be administered at any single injection site. The maximum recommended total dose (upper and lower limb combined) of Dysport for the treatment of spasticity in adults is 1500 units. Although the actual location of the injection sites can be determined by palpation, the use of injection guiding techniques (e.g. electromyography, electrical stimulation, or ultrasound) is recommended to target the injection sites.

- **Upper limb spasticity**: In the clinical trial that assessed the efficacy and safety of Dysport for the treatment of upper limb spasticity in adults, doses of 500 units and 1000 units were divided among selected muscles at a given treatment session. Repeat Dysport treatment should be administered when the effect of a previous injection has diminished, but no sooner than 12 weeks after the previous injection. A majority of patients in clinical studies were retreated between 12–16 weeks; however, some patients had a longer duration of response (i.e. 20 weeks). The degree and pattern of muscle spasticity at the time of re-injection may necessitate alterations in the dose of Dysport.

### Benign fasciculations: A follow-up study with electrophysiological studies [^11738QXR]. Muscle & Nerve (2021). Low credibility.

Fasciculations can be symptomatic, yet not progress to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a condition categorized as benign fasciculation syndrome (BFS). We aimed to assess electrodiagnostic changes and the clinical course over time in patients with BFS.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective review of medical records of patients who were referred due to a suspicion of ALS or who had directly asked for a consultation because of a personal concern regarding ALS. All clinical and electromyography (EMG) investigations were performed by the same neurologist, following an established protocol. In addition, laboratory testing and imaging studies were performed as determined to be clinically necessary.

- **Results**: We included 37 subjects (mean age 46 ± 14.7 years, 29 male, 7 healthcare professionals). Most patients had experienced fasciculations in both upper and lower limb muscles (62.2%); the remaining patients had fasciculations only in their lower limbs. EMG in seven subjects showed chronic neurogenic potentials in addition to fasciculation potentials; all of these were older men. Follow-up data were available for 24 patients (median 4.7 years), 21 with repeat EMGs, including all those with neurogenic EMG changes at baseline (median 6.5 years). Two-thirds of patients reported symptomatic improvement: 57.1% of those with abnormal EMG and 61.1% with normal EMG. The EMG changes were stable.

- **Discussion**: The prognosis of BFS is favorable, regardless of minor EMG abnormalities. The latter do not necessarily imply progression to ALS.

### The electromyographic diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: Does the evidence support the El Escorial criteria [^111X7yhQ]. Muscle & Nerve (2007). Low credibility.

The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to examine the accuracy of the El Escorial electromyographic criteria for the diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Based on a consecutive series of 73 patients with suspected ALS, the sensitivity of electromyography (EMG) ranged from 0.2 in the cranial segment to 0.74 in the thoracic segment. Specificity was highest (0.92–1.0) in the cranial and thoracic segments. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to examine the effect of varying the number of abnormal segments required for the diagnosis, we found an overall accuracy of 0.90 and 0.87 if one or two abnormal segments, respectively, were required. The best combination of sensitivity and specificity was achieved by requiring EMG changes in two segments with abnormalities in a single muscle in the cranial and thoracic segments but abnormalities in two muscles in the cervical and lumbosacral regions. These findings lend support to the EMG criteria proposed at El Escorial.

### French Society of ENT (SFORL) guidelines. Management of acute Bell's palsy [^114EWWeN]. European Annals of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Bell's palsy, more specifically with respect to electrodiagnostic testing, the SFORL 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining the following studies during electroneuromyography for optimal prognostic value:

- **Study of bilateral facial nerve motor conduction**: Recorded in several muscles, including at least one peri-oral muscle (nasolabial groove, orbicularis oris, mentalis). Ideally, double recording simultaneously studies muscles with superior (nasalis, nasolabial groove) and inferior branch innervation (orbicularis oris, on the midline method). The nasolabial groove muscles may be more relevant for the patient, being preponderant in smiling. The prognostic value of compound muscle action potential amplitude in the orbicularis oculi seems to be controversial.

- **Study of blinking reflex**

- **Study of myography in more than two muscles**: From the superior and inferior facial nerve branches, screening for spontaneous activity at rest and assessing the recruitment of motor units under effort.
