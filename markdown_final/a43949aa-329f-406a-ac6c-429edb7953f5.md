## Question

What is the role for Keppra in non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of Keppra (levetiracetam) in non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and seizure epidemiology in aneurysmal SAH. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines recommend regarding prophylaxis. Next, I will review the direct and indirect evidence for levetiracetam, including dosing and duration. After that, I need to check safety and drug–drug interaction considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach and state a bottom-line recommendation with caveats.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk profile. Seizures in aneurysmal SAH can be onset/at-rupture, early within the first week, or late thereafter, with reported early seizure rates around 10–20% and higher risk in poor-grade SAH, ruptured MCA aneurysm, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, or cortical infarction; nonconvulsive seizures are common in poor-grade patients and are associated with worse outcomes, though causality is uncertain [^116QrdJo] [^115f4SrW] [^113chCec] [^112BTpYo].

> Wait, let me verify guideline positions before jumping to practice. The 2023 AHA/ASA aSAH guideline advises against routine prophylactic antiseizure medication in patients without high-seizure-risk features, but allows consideration of a short prophylactic course in high-risk patients; importantly, it recommends avoiding phenytoin due to excess morbidity and limiting prophylaxis to no more than 7 days if used, while treating any diagnosed clinical or electrographic seizures promptly [^114bEHSw] [^116wzLa2] [^115cDGJ4]. The European Stroke Organisation similarly recommends against primary or secondary prophylaxis for acute symptomatic seizures after SAH, underscoring the lack of supportive evidence [^117Y4Ksw] [^114uBxM6].

> I need to check the direct evidence for levetiracetam in SAH. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — there are no adequately powered randomized trials specifically testing levetiracetam prophylaxis in SAH; the best we have is a small, underpowered randomized trial comparing 3 days versus extended levetiracetam that showed no significant difference in in-hospital seizures and suggested better functional outcomes with the shorter course, though it was terminated early and not definitive [^115f4SrW]. A 2022 systematic review and meta-analysis across SAH, ICH, TBI, and neurosurgery found no significant seizure reduction with levetiracetam prophylaxis versus no ASM or versus other ASMs, highlighting the paucity and bias of available data [^114FstnH].

> Let me consider indirect evidence from ICH, since mechanisms and seizure risks overlap. The PEACH RCT in spontaneous ICH showed that levetiracetam 500 mg IV twice daily reduced electrographic seizures within 72 hours compared with placebo, but the trial was small, stopped early, and did not demonstrate improved functional outcomes; moreover, NCS 2025 guidelines still recommend avoiding routine prophylaxis in ICH, favoring short-course levetiracetam if prophylaxis is used for select patients, given adverse event signals with prolonged use and lack of outcome benefit [^1128kRV8] [^111VNoCp] [^114uHMw8] [^113AHwiv]. Observational data in ICH also suggest worse cognitive outcomes with prophylactic levetiracetam, reinforcing caution with indiscriminate use [^1166vLm3].

> I should double-check dosing and pharmacokinetics because underdosing is common in the ICU. Critically ill patients clear levetiracetam faster, and low doses such as 500 mg twice daily frequently fail to achieve therapeutic serum levels; prospective data show higher maintenance dosing of 750–1000 mg twice daily more reliably achieves target levels and is associated with lower seizure occurrence, whereas renal impairment necessitates dose adjustments and post-dialysis redosing when applicable [^114XPUXL] [^1179dh4y]. But wait, what if we extrapolate SAH dosing from ICH? Given the absence of SAH-specific PK data, using 750–1000 mg twice daily after an appropriate loading dose is reasonable when prophylaxis is indicated, with earlier reassessment for de-escalation if no seizures occur [^1179dh4y].

> Next, I should review safety and drug–drug interactions. Phenytoin is consistently associated with worse outcomes and more complications in aSAH and should be avoided for prophylaxis; levetiracetam is generally preferred when an ASM is used because it lacks cytochrome P450 interactions, has minimal protein binding, and does not require routine level monitoring, though neurobehavioral adverse effects including agitation and sleep disturbance can occur and may be problematic in some patients [^114f2pUN] [^116wzLa2] [^112BysEf]. Hold on, I should verify that these safety statements are guideline-backed rather than anecdotal — the AHA/ASA explicitly warns against phenytoin and contemporary neurocritical care guidance favors levetiracetam when prophylaxis is chosen, aligning with this risk–benefit framing [^114f2pUN] [^112BysEf].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach, but I need to ensure it aligns with risk stratification. For low-risk SAH patients without high-seizure-risk features, I should avoid routine prophylaxis altogether and reserve ASM for documented seizures; for high-risk patients with features such as ruptured MCA aneurysm, high-grade SAH, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, or cortical infarction, it is reasonable to consider a short prophylactic course of levetiracetam for up to 7 days, ideally after aneurysm securement, with early discontinuation if no seizures occur; any clinical or electrographic seizure should be treated and ASM continued for at least 7 days, with longer courses individualized to recurrence and risk factors [^114bEHSw] [^117Wmf8v] [^115cDGJ4]. I should confirm EEG strategy — continuous EEG is reasonable in poor-grade or deteriorating patients to detect nonconvulsive seizures, which can guide treatment intensity and duration decisions [^117Wmf8v] [^111ymScC].

> Hmm, wait a minute — what about duration beyond 7 days? The AHA/ASA advises that extending prophylaxis beyond 7 days does not reduce future SAH-associated seizure risk in patients without prior epilepsy, and meta-analytic data in SAH suggest prolonged prophylaxis may worsen outcomes without improving seizure prevention, so I should avoid routine long-term prophylaxis and taper off if no seizures occur [^115cDGJ4] [^114qckLd]. I should double-check that this applies to patients without a history of epilepsy — yes, the guidance is specific to those without preexisting seizure disorders, and patients with established epilepsy require tailored chronic ASM management [^115cDGJ4].

> Bottom line, I need to be precise. The role of levetiracetam in non-traumatic, aneurysmal SAH is as a conditional, short-term prophylactic agent for high-risk patients, not as routine universal prophylaxis; when used, typical practice is to load and maintain 750–1000 mg twice daily with attention to renal function, limit duration to 7 days or fewer if no seizures, avoid phenytoin, and deploy continuous EEG in poor-grade or deteriorating patients to detect and treat nonconvulsive seizures, acknowledging that definitive randomized SAH-specific prophylaxis data are lacking [^114bEHSw] [^1179dh4y] [^115GBnZC] [^117Wmf8v].

Keppra (levetiracetam) is **not routinely recommended** for seizure prophylaxis in non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) [^114bEHSw] because evidence does not show a clear reduction in seizures or improved outcomes [^114FstnH]. It may be considered for **short-term prophylaxis (≤ 7 days)** in high-risk patients — such as those with ruptured MCA aneurysm, high-grade SAH, intracerebral hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, or cortical infarction [^1157VFza] — but routine use is discouraged [^117Wmf8v]. If used, levetiracetam is preferred over phenytoin due to fewer drug interactions and adverse effects [^112BysEf]; typical dosing is 500–1,000 mg IV/PO every 12 hours, adjusted for renal function [^1179dh4y] [^114XPUXL]. Continuous EEG is recommended for high-risk or deteriorating patients to detect nonconvulsive seizures [^111ymScC] [^113chCec].

## Incidence and risk factors for seizures in non-traumatic SAH

Seizures occur in approximately 10–20% of patients with SAH, predominantly in the acute phase [^115f4SrW]. Risk factors include:

- **High-grade SAH**: Associated with increased seizure risk [^111ymScC].
- **Ruptured middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysm**: Higher incidence of seizures [^1157VFza].
- **Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)**: Concurrent ICH increases seizure risk [^1157VFza].
- **Hydrocephalus**: Associated with higher seizure incidence [^1157VFza].
- **Cortical infarction**: Increases seizure risk [^1157VFza].

## Evidence for levetiracetam prophylaxis in SAH

The evidence for routine levetiracetam prophylaxis in SAH is **limited and inconclusive** [^114FstnH]. A systematic review and meta-analysis found no significant reduction in seizure incidence with levetiracetam compared to no antiseizure medication or other antiseizure medications in SAH patients [^114FstnH]. Additionally, a randomized controlled trial comparing brief (3-day) versus extended levetiracetam prophylaxis found no significant difference in in-hospital seizure occurrence, although

### Levetiracetam for seizure prophylaxis in neurocritical care: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114FstnH]. Neurocritical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Levetiracetam is commonly used for seizure prophylaxis in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), traumatic brain injury (TBI), supratentorial neurosurgery, and spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). However, its efficacy, optimal dosing, and the adverse events associated with levetiracetam prophylaxis remain unclear.

Methods

A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane central register of controlled trials (CENTRAL) database was conducted from January 1, 2000, to October 30, 2020, including articles addressing treatment with levetiracetam for seizure prophylaxis after SAH, ICH, TBI, and supratentorial neurosurgery. Non-English, pediatric (aged < 18 years), preclinical, reviews, case reports, and articles that included patients with a preexisting seizure condition or epilepsy were excluded. The coprimary meta-analyses examined first seizure events in (1) levetiracetam versus no antiseizure medication and (2) levetiracetam versus other antiseizure medications in all ICH, TBI, SAH, and supratentorial neurosurgery populations. Secondary meta-analyses evaluated the same comparator groups in individual disease populations. Risk of bias in non-randomised studies - of interventions (ROBINS-I) and risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB-2) tools were used to assess risk of bias.

Results

A total of 30 studies (n = 6 randomized trials, n = 9 prospective studies, and n = 15 retrospective studies), including 7609 patients (n = 4737 with TBI, n = 701 with SAH, n = 261 with ICH, and n = 1910 with neurosurgical diseases) were included in analyses. Twenty-seven of 30 (90%) studies demonstrated moderate to severe risk of bias, and 11 of 30 (37%) studies used low-dosage levetiracetam (250–500 mg twice daily). In the primary meta-analyses, there were no differences in seizure events for levetiracetam prophylaxis (n = 906) versus no antiseizure medication (n = 2728; odds ratio [OR] 0.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53–1.16, P = 0.23, fixed-effect, I² = 26%, P = 0.23 for heterogeneity) or levetiracetam (n = 1950) versus other antiseizure prophylaxis (n = 2289; OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.55–1.28, P = 0.41, random-effects, I² = 49%, P = 0.005 for heterogeneity). Only patients with supratentorial neurosurgical diseases benefited from levetiracetam compared with other antiseizure medications (median 0.70 seizure events per-patient-year with levetiracetam versus 2.20 seizure events per-patient-year for other antiseizure medications, OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.20–0.58, P < 0.001, fixed-effects, I² = 39%, P = 0.13 for heterogeneity). There were no significant differences in meta-analyses of patients with ICH, SAH, or TBI. Adverse events of any severity were reported in a median of 8% of patients given levetiracetam compared with 21% of patients in comparator groups.

Conclusions

Based on the current moderately to seriously biased heterogeneous data, which frequently used low and possibly subtherapeutic doses of levetiracetam, our meta-analyses did not demonstrate significant reductions in seizure incidence and neither supports nor refutes the use of levetiracetam prophylaxis in TBI, SAH, or ICH. Levetiracetam may be preferred post supratentorial neurosurgery. More high-quality randomized trials of prophylactic levetiracetam are warranted.

### Safety and efficacy of prophylactic levetiracetam for prevention of epileptic seizures in the acute phase of intracerebral haemorrhage (PEACH): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^1128kRV8]. The Lancet: Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Background

The incidence of early seizures (occurring within 7 days of stroke onset) after intracerebral haemorrhage reaches 30% when subclinical seizures are diagnosed by continuous EEG. Early seizures might be associated with haematoma expansion and worse neurological outcomes. Current guidelines do not recommend prophylactic antiseizure treatment in this setting. We aimed to assess whether prophylactic levetiracetam would reduce the risk of acute seizures in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage.

Methods

The double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 PEACH trial was conducted at three stroke units in France. Patients (aged 18 years or older) who presented with a non-traumatic intracerebral haemorrhage within 24 h after onset were randomly assigned (1:1) to levetiracetam (intravenous 500 mg every 12 h) or matching placebo. Randomisation was done with a web-based system and stratified by centre and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at baseline. Treatment was continued for 6 weeks. Continuous EEG was started within 24 h after inclusion and recorded over 48 h. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of at least one clinical seizure within 72 h of inclusion or at least one electrographic seizure recorded on continuous EEG, analysed in the modified intention-to-treat population, which comprised all patients who were randomly assigned to treatment and who had a continuous EEG performed. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02631759, and is now closed. Recruitment was prematurely stopped after 48% of the recruitment target was reached due to a low recruitment rate and cessation of funding.

Findings

Between June 1, 2017, and April 14, 2020, 50 patients with mild-to-moderate severity intracerebral haemorrhage were included: 24 were assigned to levetiracetam and 26 to placebo. During the first 72 h, a clinical or electrographic seizure was observed in three (16%) of 19 patients in the levetiracetam group versus ten (43%) of 23 patients in the placebo group (odds ratio 0·16, 95% CI 0·03–0·94, p = 0·043). All seizures in the first 72 h were electrographic seizures only. No difference in depression or anxiety reporting was observed between the groups at 1 month or 3 months. Depression was recorded in three (13%) patients who received levetiracetam versus four (15%) patients who received placebo, and anxiety was reported for two (8%) patients versus one (4%) patient. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events in the levetiracetam group versus the placebo group were headache (nine [39%] vs six [24%]), pain (three [13%] vs ten [40%]), and falls (seven [30%] vs four [16%]). The most frequent serious adverse events were neurological deterioration due to the intracerebral haemorrhage (one [4%] vs four [16%]) and severe pneumonia (two [9%] vs two [8%]). No treatment-related death was reported in either group.

Interpretation

Levetiracetam might be effective in preventing acute seizures in intracerebral haemorrhage. Larger studies are needed to determine whether seizure prophylaxis improves functional outcome in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage.

Levetiracetam (LEV) trial context and imprecision — A small randomized trial showed potential benefit for LEV compared to placebo for reducing clinical or electrographic seizure incidence at 72 h, but the study was stopped early with baseline differences between groups, including worse NIHSS score, younger age, and two-fold higher ICH volume in the placebo group; the wide CI and small study size suggest imprecision and risk of type 1 error, and several studies reported adjusted odds ratios for mRS scores of 4–6 at 90 days.

### What's new in subarachnoid hemorrhage [^1127YD93]. Intensive Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Seizures

Using surface electroencephalography (EEG), seizures are recorded in around 8% of patients after SAH but invasive EEG monitoring identifies seizure activity in almost 40%. Continuous EEG monitoring is the only reliable way to detect subclinical seizures, and it may also predict DCI many hours in advance of clinical symptoms. Actual seizures must be treated aggressively but universal prophylaxis remains controversial. Three days of treatment offers similar seizure prevention and better outcome than longer-term therapy. Phenytoin has been associated with cognitive effects and poor outcome and, although of equal efficacy in controlling seizures, levetiracetam is often chosen for the management of early-onset seizures because of its more favourable side-effect profile.

Intracerebral hemorrhage levetiracetam (LEV) prophylaxis — one retrospective study of 142 patients (n = 38 received LEV prophylaxis 500 twice daily for a median of 7 days; n = 104 that did not receive ASM) found LEV use was associated with worse quality‑of‑life cognitive function at 1 month after adjusting for age and admission NIHSS score (5.1 points lower, P = 0.01), whereas at 3 and 12 months cognitive scores did not differ between patients who had received LEV compared to those who had not.

### A randomized trial of brief versus extended seizure prophylaxis after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^115f4SrW]. Neurocritical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Seizures occur in 10–20% of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), predominantly in the acute phase. However, anticonvulsant prophylaxis remains controversial, with studies suggesting a brief course may be adequate and longer exposure may be associated with worse outcomes. Nonetheless, in the absence of controlled trials to inform practice, patients continue to receive variable chemoprophylaxis. The objective of this study was to compare brief versus extended seizure prophylaxis after aneurysmal SAH.

Methods

We performed a prospective, single-center, randomized, open-label trial of a brief (3-day) course of levetiracetam (LEV) versus extended treatment (until hospital discharge). The primary outcome was in-hospital seizure. Secondary outcomes included drug discontinuation and functional outcome.

Results

Eighty-four SAH patients had been randomized when the trial was terminated due to slow enrollment. In-hospital seizures occurred in three (9%) of 35 in the brief LEV group versus one (2%) of 49 in the extended group (p = 0.2). Ten (20%) of the extended group discontinued LEV prematurely, primarily due to sedation. Four of five seizures (including one pre-randomization) occurred in patients with early brain injury (EBI) on computed tomography (CT) scans (adjusted OR 12.5, 95% CI 1.2–122, p = 0.03). Good functional outcome (mRS 0–2) was more likely in the brief LEV group (83 vs. 61%, p = 0.04).

Conclusions

This study was underpowered to demonstrate superiority of extended LEV for seizure prophylaxis, although a trend to benefit was seen. Seizures primarily occurred in those with radiographic EBI, suggesting targeted prophylaxis may be preferable. Larger trials are required to evaluate optimal chemoprophylaxis in SAH, especially in light of worse outcomes in those receiving extended treatment.

Nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage — evidence limitations include sparse continuous EEG monitoring, variable seizure definitions, and inconsistent levetiracetam dosing: only one study used at least 48 h of continuous EEG; other studies relied on clinical detection without screening for electrographic seizures; early seizure was defined as within 2 weeks in one study, within 1 week in two, and was undefined in another; LEV dosing ranged from 250 mg twice daily to 500 mg twice daily to 1,000 mg twice daily; two studies did not report ASM dose; no study evaluated LEV levels; most studies titrated PHT to therapeutic free PHT levels; and no study systematically collected adverse event data using standardized tools.

### Prospective, randomized, single-blinded comparative trial of intravenous levetiracetam versus phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis [^113rvbRQ]. Neurocritical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Anti-epileptic drugs are commonly used for seizure prophylaxis after neurological injury. We performed a study comparing intravenous (IV) levetiracetam (LEV) to IV phenytoin (PHT) for seizure prophylaxis after neurological injury.

Methods

In this prospective, single-center, randomized, single-blinded comparative trial of LEV versus PHT (2:1 ratio) in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) or subarachnoid hemorrhage (NCT00618436) patients received IV load with either LEV or fosphenytoin followed by standard IV doses of LEV or PHT. Doses were adjusted to maintain therapeutic serum PHT concentrations or if patients had seizures. Continuous EEG (cEEG) monitoring was performed for the initial 72 h; outcome data were collected.

Results

A total of 52 patients were randomized (LEV = 34; PHT = 18); 89% with sTBI. When controlling for baseline severity, LEV patients experienced better long-term outcomes than those on PHT; the Disability Rating Scale score was lower at 3 months (P = 0.042) and the Glasgow Outcomes Scale score was higher at 6 months (P = 0.039). There were no differences between groups in seizure occurrence during cEEG (LEV 5/34 vs. PHT 3/18; P = 1.0) or at 6 months (LEV 1/20 vs. PHT 0/14; P = 1.0), mortality (LEV 14/34 vs. PHT 4/18; P = 0.227). There were no differences in side effects between groups (all P > 0.15) except for a lower frequency of worsened neurological status (P = 0.024), and gastrointestinal problems (P = 0.043) in LEV-treated patients.

Conclusions

This study of LEV versus PHT for seizure prevention in the NSICU showed improved long-term outcomes of LEV-treated patients vis-à-vis PHT-treated patients. LEV appears to be an alternative to PHT for seizure prophylaxis in this setting.

### Levetiracetam is neuroprotective in murine models of closed head injury and subarachnoid hemorrhage [^111tgzq9]. Neurocritical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

Prophylactic treatment with antiepileptic drugs is common practice following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and traumatic brain injury. However, commonly used antiepileptic drugs have multiple drug interactions, require frequent monitoring of serum levels, and are associated with adverse effects that may prompt discontinuation. In the current study, we test the hypothesis that levetiracetam, an anticonvulsant with favorable interaction and adverse event profiles, is neuroprotective in clinically relevant models of SAH and closed head injury (CHI).

Methods

A single intravenous dose of vehicle, low-dose (18 mg/kg), or high-dose (54 mg/kg) levetiracetam was administered intravenously followed CHI. Functional assessments were performed on a daily basis, and histological assessments performed at 24 hours. In a separate series of experiments, mice were randomized to receive intravenous administration of vehicle, low-dose, or high-dose levetiracetam every 12 hours for 3 days following SAH. Functional endpoints were assessed daily, followed by measurement of MCA luminal diameter on day 3.

Results

A single dose of levetiracetam improved functional and histological outcomes after CHI. This effect appeared specific for levetiracetam and was not associated with fosphenytoin treatment. Treatment with levetiracetam also improved functional outcomes and reduced vasospasm following SAH.

Conclusion

Levetiracetam is neuroprotective in clinically relevant animal models of SAH and CHI. Levetiracetam may be a therapeutic alternative to phenytoin following acute brain injury in the clinical setting when seizure prophylaxis is indicated.

PICO 2 — levetiracetam (LEV) versus phenytoin/fosphenytoin (PHT/fPHT) in our practice: If a prophylactic ASM is used, we generally prefer LEV to PHT/fPHT because of fewer drug interactions, less albumin binding (and hence less fluctuation in levels over time), and lower risk of fever and sedation. We typically use a loading dose of LEV followed by maintenance dosages of at least 750–1000 mg twice daily, and the higher maintenance dosage is suggested because the terminal half-life of LEV is shorter in critically ill patients, leading to more rapid drug metabolism and systemic clearance, than in noncritically ill patients. In a meta-analysis of 30 studies that evaluated LEV for seizure prophylaxis in patients with TBI, subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and supratentorial neurosurgery, the authors found no significant differences in seizure.

### Optimal dosing of levetiracetam for seizure prophylaxis in critically ill patients: a prospective observational study [^114XPUXL]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Critically ill patients eliminate levetiracetam (LEV) more rapidly than healthy controls, yet low doses are commonly used for seizure prophylaxis in the ICU setting. We compared the rates of achievement of target serum levels and new onset seizure (clinical and/or electrographic) among patients who received low (500mg bid) versus high (750–1,000mg bid) dose LEV.

Design

Prospective, observational study.

Setting

Tertiary care, academic center.

Patients

We included patients who received prophylactic LEV following traumatic brain injury, intracerebral hemorrhage, spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage, or supratentorial neurosurgery between 2019 and 2021. Patients with a history of seizure, antiseizure medication use, or renal failure requiring dialysis were excluded.

Interventions

None.

Measurements

LEV levels were obtained at steady state. The impact of low-dose versus high-dose LEV on the primary outcome of target LEV levels (12–46 μg/mL), and the secondary outcome of clinical and/or electrographic seizure, were assessed using multivariable logistic regression analyses adjusting for age, LEV loading dose, BMI, primary diagnosis and creatinine clearance (CrCl).

Main Results

Of the 205 subjects included in analyses, n = 106 (52%) received LEV 500mg bid (median 13mg/kg/d), and n = 99 (48%) received LEV 750–1,000mg bid (median 25mg/kg/d). Overall, 111 of 205 patients (54%) achieved target levels: 48 (45%) from the low-dose group versus 63 (64%) from the high-dose group (odds ratio [OR] 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1–3.7; p = 0.009). In multivariable analyses, high-dose LEV predicted target levels (adjusted OR [aOR] 2.23; 95% CI, 1.16–4.27; p = 0.016), and was associated with lower seizure odds (aOR 0.32; 95% CI, 0.13–0.82; p = 0.018) after adjusting for age, loading dose, BMI, diagnosis, and CrCl.

Conclusions

Underdosing of LEV was common, with only 54% of patients achieving target serum levels. Higher doses (750–1,000mg bid) were more than twice as likely to lead to optimal drug levels and reduced the odds of seizure by 68% compared with low-dose regimens (500mg bid).

Levetiracetam dosing considerations in adult neurocritical care (including TBI) indicate underdosing is common and higher doses may be needed: 37% of studies used low LEV dosages (250–500 mg BID), with 500 mg BID being the most commonly prescribed; a pharmacokinetic study suggested LEV dosages of 500 mg BID have less than 25% probability of achieving therapeutic levels and that dosages as high as 3000–4000 mg/day may be required; in a prospective study of adult neurocritically ill patients (including TBI, subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage (IPH), and supratentorial neurosurgery), LEV 750–1000 mg BID was associated with a two-fold increased odds of achieving target drug levels and a 68% lower odds of clinical or electrographic seizure compared to low-dosage LEV (500 mg BID); for renal impairment, lower dosages of LEV (500 mg once or twice daily) may be considered in patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min or in those requiring renal replacement therapy, and redosing of LEV post dialysis may be necessary; LEV may not be preferred in patients with depression, agitation, or other psychiatric features, and alternate ASMs (e.g., lacosamide) may be considered, though evaluation of these medications was beyond the scope of this PICO.

### Antiepileptic drugs for the primary and secondary prevention of seizures after subarachnoid haemorrhage [^115GBnZC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Subarachnoid haemorrhage may result in seizures both acutely and in the longer term. The use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in the primary and secondary prevention of seizures after subarachnoid haemorrhage is uncertain, and there is currently no consensus on treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effects of AEDs for the primary and secondary prevention of seizures after subarachnoid haemorrhage.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 1) in The Cochrane Library, and MEDLINE (1946 to 12th March 2013). We checked the reference lists of articles retrieved from these searches.

Selection Criteria

We considered all randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials in which patients were assigned to a treatment (one or more AEDs) or placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (RM and JK) independently screened and assessed the methodological quality of the studies. If studies were included, one author extracted the data and the other checked it.

Main Results

No relevant studies were found.

Authors' Conclusions

There was no evidence to support or refute the use of antiepileptic drugs for the primary or secondary prevention of seizures related to subarachnoid haemorrhage. Well-designed randomised controlled trials are urgently needed to guide clinical practice.

Subarachnoid hemorrhage

Early and late-onset seizures are observed in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Risk factors include the severity of SAH, concomitant intracerebral or intraventricular blood, and treatment with craniotomy. A recent study noted a 10% incidence of seizures, with almost half (47%) occurring within the initial 24 h. Interestingly, the use of prophylactic anticonvulsants did not reduce the overall risk. As seizures dramatically increase cerebral blood flow and blood pressure, rebleeding from a recently ruptured aneurysm during seizures may pose a serious risk.

Current guidelines from the AHA state that the use of anticonvulsants for a brief period is reasonable, without specific drug recommendation. Beyond the immediate posthemorrhagic period, routine use of anticonvulsants is advocated by the AHA only in patients with a high risk for delayed seizures, such as prior seizure, intracerebral hematoma, intractable hypertension, infarction, or middle cerebral artery aneurysm. The Neurocritical Care Society (NCS) specifically recommended against the routine use of phenytoin for prophylaxis.

Brain tumors

The incidence of seizures in cerebral malignancy broadly ranges from about 10% to as high as 90%, and is correlated with tumor type (glioma and oligodendroglioma being amongst the highest risk) and also the rate of progression, with slow growing tumors tending towards higher seizure incidence. Prophylactic use of AEDs in brain tumors remains controversial. There are strikingly little data in support of seizure prophylaxis for brain tumor patients, and guidelines by the AAN and the European Federation of Neurosciences do not support this practice. Since these guidelines were written prior to the widespread use of cEEG and prior to the introduction of newer, less toxic anticonvulsants (levetiracetam, lamotrigine, lacosamide, and so forth), some have suggested that such a recommendation should be reassessed.

Whenever patients require adjuvant chemotherapy, it is prudent to avoid the use of potent CYP3A4 coenzyme inducers such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital because of the risks of compromising concurrent chemotherapy. Based on more recent evidence, more patients are being managed with levetiracetam than phenytoin or sodium valproate, but evidence of superior efficacy remains absent.

### Prophylactic anticonvulsants in intracerebral hemorrhage [^112D2mSH]. Neurocritical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Prophylactic anticonvulsants are routinely prescribed in the acute setting for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients, but some studies have reported an association with worse outcomes. We sought to characterize the prevalence and predictors of prophylactic anticonvulsant administration after ICH as well as guideline adherence. We also sought to determine whether prophylactic anticonvulsants were independently associated with poor outcome.

Methods

We performed a retrospective study of primary ICH in our two academic centers. We used a propensity matching approach to make treated and non-treated groups comparable. We conducted multiple logistic regression analysis to identify independent predictors of prophylactic anticonvulsant initiation and its association with poor outcome as measured by modified Rankin score.

Results

We identified 610 patients with primary ICH, of whom 98 were started on prophylactic anticonvulsants. Levetiracetam (97%) was most commonly prescribed. Age (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.95–0.99, p < .001), lobar location (OR 2.94, 95% CI 1.76–4.91, p < .001), higher initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.40–3.79, p = .001), craniotomy (OR 3.06, 95% CI 1.51–6.20, p = .002), and prior ICH (OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.10–5.07, p = .028) were independently associated with prophylactic anticonvulsant initiation. Prophylactic anticonvulsant use was not associated with worse functional outcome [modified Rankin score (mRS) 4–6] at hospital discharge or with increased case-fatality. There was no difference in prescribing patterns after 2010 guideline publication.

Discussion

Levetiracetam was routinely prescribed following ICH and was not associated with worse outcomes. Future investigations should examine the effect of prophylactic levetiracetam on cost and neuropsychological outcomes as well as the role of continuous EEG in identifying subclinical seizures.

### Guidelines for seizure prophylaxis in patients hospitalized with nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage: a clinical practice guideline for health care professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society [^114Khu2o]. Neurocritical Care (2025). High credibility.

Neurocritical Care Society — methods and key evidence for ASM prophylaxis in adults with acute nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) include a systematic review and meta-analysis with predefined PICO questions and outcomes. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing ASM primary prophylaxis in adults hospitalized with acute nontraumatic ICH, and the initial literature search yielded 1,988 articles, and 15 formed the basis of the recommendations. The population, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) questions assessed whether ASM versus no ASM should be used, whether levetiracetam (LEV) or phenytoin/fosphenytoin (PHT/fPHT) should be preferentially used, and whether a long (> 7 days) versus short (≤ 7 days) duration should be used, with main outcomes including early seizure (≤ 14 days), late seizures (> 14 days), adverse events, mortality, and functional and cognitive outcomes. For PICO 1, although there was no significant impact of ASM on early or late seizure or mortality, meta-analyses demonstrated increased adverse events and higher relative risk of poor functional outcomes at 90 days with prophylactic ASM use; for PICO 2, we did not detect any significant positive or negative effect of PHT/fPHT compared to LEV for early seizures or adverse events, although point estimates tended to favor LEV; and for PICO 3, based on one decision analysis, quality-adjusted life-years were increased with a shorter duration of ASM prophylaxis.

### Guidelines for seizure prophylaxis in patients hospitalized with nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage: a clinical practice guideline for health care professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society [^113AHwiv]. Neurocritical Care (2025). High credibility.

Neurocritical Care Society (NCS) guideline — seizure prophylaxis in acute nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) without prior seizures provides weak recommendations with very low quality of evidence: The NCS guideline panel suggests against the use of prophylactic antiseizure medication (ASM) following acute nontraumatic ICH, noting trivial prevention of early/late seizures and mortality but more adverse events and a small increase in worse functional outcomes (modified Rankin scale [mRS] scores 4–6) with ASM use. If a prophylactic ASM is used, the NCS guideline panel suggests levetiracetam (LEV) should be used rather than phenytoin/fosphenytoin (PHT/fPHT) for seizure prophylaxis, citing signals for lower early seizures and fewer adverse events together with pharmacokinetic and interaction advantages. If prophylaxis is given, the NCS guideline panel suggests a short duration of use (≤ 7 days) versus a longer duration of use (> 7 days), supported by greater quality‑adjusted life years with no or short‑term ASM (≤ 7 days), the highest recurrent seizure risk in the first 72 h, and associations between prolonged courses (e.g., 4–6 weeks) and more adverse events.

Seizures and status epilepticus

Seizures in aSAH may be encountered at the time of bleeding, during hospitalization, and months or years later (ESM, Table S1). Underlying mechanisms are debated and may include gliosis, neuroinflammation, and cerebral hyperaemia. The SAFARI score may help identify those at risk for convulsive in-hospital seizures based on older age, pre-hospitalization seizures, ruptured anterior circulation aneurysms, and ventricular drainage. Recent guidelines state that cEEG is reasonable, primarily for aSAH patients with impaired consciousness or fluctuating examination, ruptured middle cerebral artery aneurysm, high-grade aSAH, intracranial haemorrhage, hydrocephalus, and cortical infarction. Periodic discharges not qualifying as seizures are prevalent and of controversial significance. Long-term epilepsy appears less likely in patients who underwent coil embolization.

Electrographic seizures and high-frequency periodic discharges (> 2.5 Hz) have been associated with increased metabolic demand that may be insufficiently compensated for by local increases in cerebral blood flow. In aSAH patients during and post-hospitalization, electrographic seizures have been associated with worse outcomes. Importantly, these associations do not imply causal effects and possibly relate to other secondary complications, such as late diagnosis of delayed cerebral ischaemia.

No adequately powered clinical trial has been conducted to guide seizure prophylaxis or treatment in aSAH patients. Recent guidelines do not recommend the routine use of prophylactic antiseizure medication (ASM), although ASM may be reasonable in patients at high risk for seizures. Phenytoin as ASM should be avoided since it may induce harm. In an underpowered, prospective, single-centre, randomized, open-label trial, the benefit from prolonged levetiracetam prophylaxis was greatest for those with imaging evidence of early brain injury and others have suggested a possible benefit against DCI with newer ASMs (levetiracetam and perampanel). All clinical or electrographic seizures that are diagnosed should be treated for at least 7 days and for those with delayed seizures or those with risk factors for seizures, more prolonged treatment should be considered. Management of periodic discharges or other ictal-interictal patterns is highly controversial, and the benefit of treatment has not been demonstrated.

### Be a PEACH and hand Me that levetiracetam: seizure prophylaxis for spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage [^112DCXgA]. Epilepsy Currents (2023). Medium credibility.

The findings from this study have led to several opportunities for further investigation. How soon was the interictal epileptiform activity seen (in 63% of patients in both study arms) during the EEG recording? Were the patients who later had seizures, the same patients who were seen to have interictal epileptiform activity early during the EEG recording? If interictal epileptiform activity was identified early during the recordings and was followed by seizures in up to 43% of patients, this finding may guide the clinical decision as to which patients should receive continuous video EEG and prophylactic levetiracetam in this setting. If so, it may be reasonable to obtain a routine EEG in all patients with spontaneous ICH (with or without altered mental status) within the first 24 hours of presentation. If the routine EEG showed interictal epileptiform activity, the treating team could begin low-dose prophylactic levetiracetam and monitor with continuous video EEG for 72 hours. If no electroclinical or electrographic seizures occur, they could then taper levetiracetam and if they did occur, titrate accordingly. An algorithm like this would be especially useful for medical centers with limited continuous video EEG resources to allow for optimal triage.

Likely because of the small number of participants randomized to each study arm, there were baseline characteristics and demographics that were significantly different between study arms. Participants in the control arm were younger, less likely to have diabetes or hypertension, and less likely to be taking antithrombotic medications. However, baseline hematoma volume was twice as large in patients in the control arm (18 mL) compared to the levetiracetam arm (9.2 mL), increasing the risk of neurologic deterioration. As the authors pointed out, larger clinical trials are needed to understand which of these factors is significant in determining seizure risk.

The optimal prophylactic anti-seizure medication to prescribe, dosing, and duration was beyond the scope of this study. In addition, it remains to be determined whether acute anti-seizure prophylaxis reduces risks of morbidity and mortality, neurologic deterioration, or chronic epilepsy. Finally, whether interictal epileptiform discharges versus electrographic versus electroclinical seizures predict worse long-term outcome with or without prophylactic anti-seizure medication also remains unknown. Findings from this study indicate that these questions warrant further investigation.

### Current practice regarding seizure prophylaxis in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage across academic centers [^113se1o8]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Object

The objective of this study was to determine current practices regarding seizure prophylaxis in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH).

Methods

An eight question survey was sent to 25 US centers with high volume aSAH cases (> 100 annually). Respondents were asked about institutional practices regarding use, duration, and type of seizure prophylaxis.

Results

13 (52%) respondents endorsed the utility of seizure prophylaxis while 10 (40%) did not, and two (8%) were unsure. Among respondents using prophylaxis, levetiracetam was the firstline medication for the majority (94%) while phenytoin was used as a primary agent at one (4%) center and as a secondary agent at four (16%) centers. Duration of levetiracetam prophylaxis ranged from 1day to 6weeks following SAH (mean 13.2; median 11). Only a single center employed EEG routinely in all aSAH patients but most supported EEG use when the neurologic examination was unreliable or inexplicably declining. 24 (96%) respondents agreed that a trial randomizing patients to levetiracetam or no antiseizure medication is warranted at this time, and all 25 (100%) believed that such a trial would be appropriate or ethically sound.

Conclusions

The routine use of seizure prophylaxis following aSAH is controversial. Among a sampling of 25 major academic centers, most administer prophylaxis, while a significant proportion does not. The majority believes a trial randomizing patients to receive seizure prophylaxis is both timely and ethical.

Nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) without prior seizures — PICO questions and prioritized outcomes focus on whether antiseizure medication (ASM) versus no ASM should be used in patients with acute nontraumatic ICH with no history of clinical or electrographic seizures; if an ASM is used, whether levetiracetam (LEV) or phenytoin/fosphenytoin (PHT/fPHT) should be preferentially used; and, if an ASM is used, whether a long (> 7 days) versus short (≤ 7 days) duration of prophylaxis should be used for patients with nontraumatic ICH and no history of clinical or electrographic seizures. Outcomes were ranked in order of importance as "critical", which included early seizure (either clinical or electrographic) occurring within 14 days of ICH.

### Be a PEACH and hand Me that levetiracetam: seizure prophylaxis for spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage [^116h5c3K]. Epilepsy Currents (2023). Medium credibility.

Unfortunately, enrollment was halted early because of challenges with cost and slow recruitment. Despite these limitations, the number of patients who had electrographic or electroclinical seizures within the first 72 hours of study inclusion was found to be significantly smaller in the active treatment arm (16%) compared to the control arm (43%, P = 0.043) of the study. A total of 6 seizures were captured in 3 patients receiving low-dose levetiracetam compared to 158 seizures in 10 patients receiving a placebo. All seizures captured were electrographic only. The number of electrographic seizures was larger in the control arm as well as duration compared to the treatment arm. There was also a large proportion of patients in each study arm with interictal epileptiform activity (63% in each group). Long-term outcomes were not evaluated.

For the purpose of the study, electrographic seizures were defined as "rhythmic discharges or spike and wave patterns with definite evolution in frequency, location, or morphology lasting at least 10 seconds" which is not identical to the new American Clinical Neurophysiology Society's Standardized Critical Care EEG Terminologywhich also defines electrographic seizures as "epileptiform discharges averaging > 2.5 Hz for ≥ 10 seconds (> 25 discharges in 10 seconds)". Applying these stricter criteria, even more patients with spontaneous ICH may be candidates for anti-seizure medication prophylaxis based on the results of the trial.

In this study, continuous EEG was obtained without video recording and not shared with the clinical team in order to blind the investigators to the presence or absence of seizures during a 48-hour recording and was later interpreted by a board-certified neurophysiologist also blinded to the study arm of the participant. This methodology may not be approved in the United States as acute ICH with altered mental status has been described as a clinical indication for continuous video EEG monitoring by expert opinion. In addition, lack of video interpretation limits the ability of investigators to differentiate electrographic from electroclinical seizures with subtle clinical changes.

### Antiepileptic drugs in critically ill patients [^115GyLs4]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Ischemic stroke

Seizures following ischemic stroke occur within an incidence range of 4% to 14%. According to a large recent registry from France, early seizures are not associated with higher mortality or unfavorable outcomes at 1 month or at 1 year. Patients with late-onset seizures have a greater than twice the risk for subsequent stroke, although the causal relationship is unclear.

Given the rather low incidence of seizures following most ischemic stroke syndromes, neither the American Heart Association (AHA) nor the American Stroke Association guidelines recommend prophylactic use of anticonvulsants following ischemic stroke. However, some patients may be at greater risk for seizures. An increase in seizure risk has been reported following cardioembolism, hyperglycemia, intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase, in patient with SE following poststroke seizures, and either large cortical or hemorrhagic infarction.

If "prophylaxis" is considered, then the agent used should be selected for its adverse effect profile. In recent years there has been some interest in ascribing statins as a "first-line" anticonvulsant in stroke patients, although supportive data are by association only and this type of intervention is not readily practiced.

Intracerebral hemorrhage

In contrast to ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) portends a somewhat higher risk of seizures, ranging from two- to seven-times that from ischemic stroke. If cEEG is performed during the acute admission period, nonconvulsive epileptiform activity is commonly observed and may affect more than 20% of ICH patients. As expected, lobar or supratentorial ICHs have the highest incidence of seizures; those in the posterior fossa have almost zero. Surgical evacuation confers an increased incidence, and subarachnoid or subdural blood also increases the risk for seizures.

Prophylactic anticonvulsant treatment in ICH patients is currently not strongly advocated. cEEG is suggested by some for ICH patients with a depressed mental status out of proportion to that expected for the severity of the stroke. Levetiracetam has become the most widely prescribed agent despite a lack of evidence, likely due to its ease of use. Uncontrolled study data have suggested that phenytoin confers worse outcomes than others (primarily against levetiracetam), but these data are not supported by other recent studies.

### Prophylactic seizure medication and health-related quality of life after intracerebral hemorrhage [^1166vLm3]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Prophylactic levetiracetam is currently used in ~40% of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage, and the potential impact of levetircetam on health-related quality of life is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that prophylactic levetiracetam is independently associated with differences in cognitive function health-related quality of life.

Design

Patients with intracerebral hemorrhage were enrolled in a prospective cohort study. We performed mixed models for T-scores of health-related quality of life, referenced to the U.S. population at 50 ± 10, accounting for severity of injury and time to follow-up.

Setting

Academic medical center.

Patients

One-hundred forty-two survivors of intracerebral hemorrhage.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

T-scores of Neuro-Quality of Life Cognitive Function v2.0 was the primary outcome, whereas Neuro-Quality of Life Mobility v1.0 and modified Rankin Scale (a global functional scale) were secondary measures. We prospectively documented if prophylactic levetiracetam was administered and retrieved administration data from the electronic health record. Patients who received prophylactic levetiracetam had worse cognitive function health-related quality of life (T-score 5.1 points lower; p = 0.01) after adjustment for age (p = 0.3), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (p < 0.000001), lobar hematoma (p = 0.9), and time of assessment; statistical models controlling for prophylactic levetiracetam and the Intracerebral Hemorrhage Score, a global measure of intracerebral hemorrhage severity, yielded similar results. Lower T-scores of cognitive function health-related quality of life at 3 months were correlated with more total levetiracetam dosage (p = 0.01) and more administered doses of levetiracetam in the hospital (p = 0.03). Patients who received prophylactic levetiracetam were more likely to have a lobar hematoma (27/38 vs 19/104; p < 0.001), undergo electroencephalography monitoring (15/38 vs 21/104; p = 0.02), but not more likely to have clinical seizures (4/38 vs 7/104; p = 0.5). Levetiracetam was not independently associated with the modified Rankin Scale scores or mobility health-related quality of life (p > 0.1).

Conclusions

Prophylactic levetiracetam was independently associated with lower cognitive function health-related quality of life at follow-up after intracerebral hemorrhage.

### Guidelines for seizure prophylaxis in patients hospitalized with nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage: a clinical practice guideline for health care professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society [^112sd71V]. Neurocritical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

There is practice heterogeneity in the use, type, and duration of prophylactic antiseizure medications (ASM) in patients hospitalized with acute nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing ASM primary prophylaxis in adults hospitalized with acute nontraumatic ICH. The following population, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) questions were assessed: (1) Should ASM versus no ASM be used in patients with acute ICH with no history of clinical or electrographic seizures? (2) If an ASM is used, should levetiracetam (LEV) or phenytoin/fosphenytoin (PHT/fPHT) be preferentially used? and (3) If an ASM is used, should a long (> 7 days) versus short (≤ 7 days) duration of prophylaxis be used? The main outcomes assessed were early seizure (≤ 14 days), late seizures (> 14 days), adverse events, mortality, and functional and cognitive outcomes. We used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology to generate recommendations.

Results

The initial literature search yielded 1,988 articles, and 15 formed the basis of the recommendations. PICO 1: although there was no significant impact of ASM on the outcomes of early or late seizure or mortality, meta-analyses demonstrated increased adverse events and higher relative risk of poor functional outcomes at 90 days with prophylactic ASM use. PICO 2: we did not detect any significant positive or negative effect of PHT/fPHT compared to LEV for early seizures or adverse events, although point estimates tended to favor LEV. PICO 3: based on one decision analysis, quality-adjusted life-years were increased with a shorter duration of ASM prophylaxis.

Conclusions

We suggest avoidance of prophylactic ASM in hospitalized adult patients with acute nontraumatic ICH (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence). If used, we suggest LEV over PHT/fPHT (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence) for a short duration (≤ 7 days; weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

### Be a PEACH and hand Me that levetiracetam: seizure prophylaxis for spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage [^1167jjDg]. Epilepsy Currents (2023). Medium credibility.

Commentary

Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) causes acute electrographic and/or electroclinical seizures in nearly one third of patients monitored with continuous video electroencephalography. Acute seizures can cause subsequent expansion of an ICH with increased morbidity and mortality. With expanding utilization of continuous video EEG, electrographic seizures have been discovered with high frequency in neurologic injury, suggesting that the overall occurrence of seizures in the setting of ICH potentially remains an underestimate. There are currently no universally accepted guidelines for pharmacologic management to prevent acute seizures (occurring within the first 7 days of symptom onset) in patients with spontaneous ICHs. The major risk of harm results from increased sedation with the addition of an anti-seizure medication. Furthermore, whether controlling acute seizures results in better long-term outcomes remains unknown, particularly when recorded seizures are electrographic-only and not electroclinical, as some evidence suggests that outcomes are independent of presence or absence of acute seizures.

Peter-Derex and colleagues designed and conducted a phase III randomized controlled trial Prevention of Epileptic seizures at the Acute phase of intraCerebral Haemorrhage (PEACH) at 3 hospitals in France to examine whether low-dose (500 mg twice a day) levetiracetam over 6 weeks reduced the incidence of electrographic and electroclinical seizures in the acute phase of ICH compared to placebo. Adults were enrolled who presented within 24 hours of symptom onset. Those with underlying structural causes as well as patients with a history of severe psychiatric disorder were excluded given the risk of levetiracetam resulting in exacerbation in these individuals. Patients underwent continuous EEG monitoring within 24 hours of enrollment and continued on placebo or levetiracetam for 30 days then a taper was initiated. The primary outcome was presence of at least one electrographic or electroclinical seizure in the first 72 hours following inclusion in the study.

Traumatic brain injury — levetiracetam (LEV) versus phenytoin (PHT) for seizure prophylaxis is reported from a prospective, randomized, single-blinded comparative trial with N = 52 (LEV = 34, PHT = 18). Seizure during cEEG occurred in 5/34 vs 3/18 (p = 1.0), seizure at 6 months in 1/20 vs 0/14 (p = 1.0), and mortality was 14/34 vs 4/18 (p = 0.227). Average GOS at 6 months was 5 vs 3 (p = 0.016) among surviving patients, and there was no difference in side effects except for worse neuro status 6/34 vs 9/18 (p = 0.024) and gastrointestinal problems 1/34 vs 4/18 (p = 0.043). Overall, patients treated with PHT or LEV had the same outcomes with respect to death or seizures, while LEV resulted in less undesirable side effects and better long-term outcomes for surviving patients.

Seizures after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) — The recommendation is to initiate antiepileptic medication in the context of an electrographic seizure that is clinically suspected to be contributing to the impaired consciousness in order to improve morbidity (defined as LOS > 14 days or discharge to somewhere other than home or a rehabilitation facility). Risk scores such as the CAVE score can be used to estimate the risk of late seizures (> 7 days after ICH), but in the absence of evidence that antiepileptic medications prevent late seizures after ICH, risk scores should not be used to guide continuation of antiepileptic drugs. If seizures are clinically suspected in this context, it is reasonable to evaluate them with a continuous electroencephalogram for at least 24 hours; one study noted that 28% of those with electrographic seizures were detected after at least 24 hours of continuous monitoring, whereas 94% were detected at least 48 hours of monitoring, and among patients in a coma, 36% required continuous electroencephalography monitoring for > 24 hours to detect the first seizure. Recent studies have not consistently identified harm or benefit from the use of prophylactic antiseizure drugs after spontaneous ICH with respect to global functional outcomes, and one meta-analysis (1 RCT, 7 observational studies) found that seizure prophylaxis was not associated with preventing either early (< 14 days from ICH) or long-term seizures; another meta-analysis reported that neither levetiracetam nor phenytoin prophylaxis was associated with worse functional outcomes at the longest follow-up or 90 days.

### Levetiracetam is associated with improved cognitive outcome for patients with intracranial hemorrhage [^113fWUa4]. Neurocritical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Background

To date, common therapy in patients with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) includes prophylaxis of seizure using antiepileptic drugs, commonly phenytoin. Phenytoin therapy is associated with a high incidence of cognitive disturbance. Levetiracetam is known to cause less cognitive disruption and may be a suitable alternative for seizure prophylaxis. Cognitive outcomes in ICH patients receiving seizure prophylaxis with levetiracetam or phenytoin are compared.

Method

A retrospective chart review was conducted with 269 patients who received prophylactic levetiracetam or phenytoin between August 2005 and May 2008. A total of 85 reviewed patients met inclusion criteria (phenytoin n = 25, levetiracetam n = 60).

Results

Statistically significant results included higher Glasgow Coma Scores (GCS) at dismissal (median, 14 vs. 11, P = 0.023), lower seizure incidence (0.0 vs. 8%, P = 0.03) for patients receiving levetiracetam than those treated with phenytoin and patients being discharged home (21.7% vs. 16%, P = 0.03). Observed trends included greater cognitive function retention rate (56.7% vs. 36%, P = 0.08).

Conclusion

Despite similarities in hemorrhage type and severity at onset, patients receiving levetiracetam had better cognition at discharge and fewer seizures than patients receiving phenytoin. These data suggest that levetiracetam is more effective than phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis without suppression of cognitive abilities in patients with ICH.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) — levetiracetam (LEV) versus phenytoin/fosphenytoin (PHT) mortality and functional outcomes are summarized as follows: A meta-analysis for mortality showed a pooled effect of risk ratio 1.06 [0.66, 1.72]. In one study, "surviving patients on LEV experienced better long-term outcomes than those on PHT", with improvements "at 1–3 months (P = 0.006), and 6 months (6 vs. 3 [P = 0.037]); GOSE at 6 months: 5 vs. 3 [P = 0.016]". Controlling for admission severity, there was "no difference in DRS at discharge (P = 0.47)", but at 3 and 6 months DRS was "5.2 points lower (95% CI 0.2–10.3, P = 0.42) and 3.7 points lower (95% CI −1.0 to 8.5, P = 0.18)" with LEV, while GOSE at 6 months was "1.5 points higher… (95% CI 0.1–3, P = 0.039)". Conversely, another randomized study "did not find a difference in GOSE… (5.6 vs. 5.1; P = 0.58)", and it had "only 19 patients", with the LEV arm "(n = 5)" showing higher median GCS "(14 vs. 3; P = 0.016)… (15 vs. 14; P = 0.044)" and the PHT arm "(n = 14)" having longer time to GCS assessment "(808.8 ± 146.0 vs. 484.8 ± 152.6, P = 0.001)".

### Phenytoin prophylaxis and functional outcomes following spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111oBJTh]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Seizure activity following spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) can worsen patients' comorbidity. However, data regarding whether seizure prophylaxis for sICH is associated with patients' poor functional outcome is inconclusive. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the relationship between phenytoin prophylaxis and poor functional outcome after sICH.

Methods

We conducted our search on PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE databases as of October 30, 2020 for studies that included information on seizure prophylaxis and functional outcome in patients with sICH. Primary outcome was poor functional outcome at the longest follow-up in patients receiving seizure prophylaxis. The secondary outcome was poor functional outcome at 90 days follow-up. We conducted random effects meta-analysis and moderator analyses to detect sources of heterogeneity for our outcomes.

Results

We included eleven studies in the final analysis with a total of 4268 patients. A moderator analysis further showed prospective studies had lower heterogeneity. We did not find an association between seizure prophylaxis and poor functional outcome at time of longest follow-up (OR 1.2, 95%CI 0.9–1.6, p-value = 0.22, I² = 61%), nor at 90-day follow-up (OR 1.4, 95%CI 0.8–2.4, p-value = 0.24, I² = 78%).

Conclusion

Seizure prophylaxis following sICH was not associated with worse functional outcomes at longest follow-up or at 90 days. Neither levetiracetam nor phenytoin was associated with outcome in our exploratory meta-regression, though there is a trend towards better outcomes in populations where there was a higher percentage of patients who received levetiracetam. More randomized trials are needed to confirm this observation.

Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) — anticonvulsant prophylaxis and EEG monitoring recommendations: Routine use of anticonvulsant prophylaxis with phenytoin is not recommended after SAH (low quality evidence — strong recommendation). Routine use of other anticonvulsants for prophylaxis may be considered (very low quality evidence — weak recommendation). If anticonvulsant prophylaxis is used, a short course (3–7 days) is recommended (low quality evidence — weak recommendation). In patients who suffer a seizure after presentation, anticonvulsants should be continued for a duration defined by local practice (low quality evidence — weak recommendation). Continuous EEG monitoring should be considered in patients with poor-grade SAH who fail to improve or who have neurological deterioration of undetermined etiology (low quality evidence — strong recommendation).

### Levetiracetam versus phenytoin: a comparison of efficacy of seizure prophylaxis and adverse event risk following acute or subacute subdural hematoma diagnosis [^114WTdBm]. Neurocritical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Although both levetiracetam and phenytoin are used for seizure prophylaxis in subdural hematomas (SDHs), there is little data on their comparative efficacies. We compared the efficacy and risk of using levetiracetam versus phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis following acute or subacute SDH diagnosis.

Methods

In this retrospective cohort study, the clinical data registry at a tertiary care hospital was searched for all cases of acute or subacute SDHs that were admitted to hospital in 2002, 2003, or 2011. Risk of clinical and/or electrographic seizures, and risk of adverse drug events were compared between the two exposure arms.

Results

124 subjects in the phenytoin arm and 164 subjects in the levetiracetam arm were included. There was no significant difference in clinical and/or electrographic seizure risk, though there was a decreased risk of adverse events in the levetiracetam arm (p < 0.001). In subjects with midline shift > 0 mm, levetiracetam was associated with an increased risk of electrographic seizures during hospitalization (p = 0.028) and a decreased risk of adverse drug effects (p = 0.001), compared with phenytoin use.

Conclusions

Levetiracetam generally appears to have a similar efficacy to phenytoin in preventing clinical and/or electrographic seizures following acute/subacute SDH diagnosis, though patients with midline shift > 0 mm may have associated with a higher risk of electrographic seizures on levetiracetam compared with patients on phenytoin. Levetiracetam is associated with a lower risk of adverse drug effects. A prospective, randomized study would more definitively determine any difference in efficacy and risk between phenytoin and levetiracetam.

### Long-term clinical trajectory of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage: linking acute care and neurorehabilitation [^113fVT7s]. Neurocritical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Assessment of Functional Outcome at 3-Month and 12-Month Follow-Up

We evaluated clinical trajectories based on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) over a 1-year period, with any decrease in the mRS (greater than one point) indicating improvement. Good functional outcome was defined as mRS ≤ 2. Outcomes at ICU discharge were prospectively assessed by the study team. Functional outcome after 3 months was assessed by a study nurse anonymized to the clinical course of the patient via telephone interview. After 12 months, patients were either examined in person by trained neurologists or, in case of patient nonattendance, via telephone interview.

In a subgroup of patients transferred to the neurorehabilitation center linked to the ICU (Rehab-Hochzirl), we reported on treatment intensities and associations/relationships between late-occurring complications and patients' trajectories. The functional outcome of these patients was quantified at Rehab-Hochzirl admission and discharge by using the mRS and the Barthel Index.

Neurorehabilitation

After discharge from the neurological ICU, 87 (35%) out of 250 surviving patients were transferred to the neurological postacute unit Hochzirl. Neurorehabilitation in Hochzirl follows a multimodal concept. The stages of treatment extend from phase A, the acute phase, to phase E, in which social and professional reintegration takes place. Our postacute neurological department specializes in treating patients in phase B and early phase C. The goal-setting was adapted to the individual needs of the patients and therapy progress was evaluated in a standardized weekly meeting consisting of an interdisciplinary team of neurological physicians and therapists. According to local regulations, patients received a maximum of 3 h of therapy, consisting of units of 45 min, on working days. The permitted therapy curriculum was used, provided that the clinical condition of the patient allowed it. The interdisciplinary team enabled a variety of conventional therapies such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. In case of neurological deterioration, a detailed symptom-oriented investigation was performed. Liquor circulation disorders were diagnosed using cranial computed tomography scans and a "tap-test" in the course of a lumbar puncture. Epileptic seizures were treated with levetiracetam as first-line treatment.

### 2023 guideline for the management of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^116QrdJo]. Stroke (2023). High credibility.

Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH)–associated seizures — timing definitions and antiseizure medication use are outlined as follows: Onset seizures occur at the time of the hemorrhage; early seizures occur during the first week; and late seizures are either postoperative or occur after 1 week, and onset seizures have been found to predict poor outcome after aSAH. Despite the absence of randomized data, providing antiseizure medications to patients with aSAH and onset seizures for a period of ≤ 7 days serves to minimize early complications related to the onset seizure in the perioperative period and decrease long-term medication side effects, whereas there are no randomized data and little other literature to suggest that treatment for > 7 days positively or negatively influences the development of late seizures. Recent meta-analyses suggest that compared with short-term use (< 3 days), the long-term use (> 3 days) of prophylactic antiseizure medications in patients with aSAH has a similar effect on in-hospital seizure prevention but is associated with poor clinical outcomes, and these data cannot be applied to the patient group that has a preexisting seizure disorder. The excess morbidity associated with the use of phenytoin should prompt the use of alternative antiseizure medications.

### Antiepileptic drugs for the primary and secondary prevention of seizures after stroke [^113TwKyg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Seizures after stroke are an important clinical problem and may result in poor outcomes. The indications of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for seizure prophylaxis after stroke remain unclear. This is an updated version of the Cochrane Review previously published in 2014.

Objectives

To assess the effects of AEDs for the primary and secondary prevention of seizures after stroke. For primary prevention, we aimed to assess whether AEDs reduce the likelihood of seizures in people who have a stroke but do not have a seizure. For secondary prevention, we aimed to assess whether AEDs reduce the likelihood of further seizures in people who have a stroke and at least one post-stroke seizure.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases on 9 March 2021: Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to March 08, 2021). CRS Web includes randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials from PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the Specialised Registers of Cochrane Review Groups including Epilepsy and Stroke. We also checked the reference lists of articles retrieved from these searches.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised and quasi-randomised controlled studies that recruited participants with a clinical diagnosis of stroke, either ischaemic or haemorrhagic. We excluded studies that only recruited participants with subarachnoid haemorrhage, subdural haemorrhage, extradural haemorrhage, or other non-stroke diagnoses such as tumour- or infection-related infarction or haemorrhage. We also excluded studies that recruited only participants who had undergone neurosurgery. We included participants of all ages suffering any seizure type who were assigned to AEDs or placebo groups.

Data Collection and Analysis

In accordance with standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration, two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion before evaluating trial risk of bias and extracting relevant data. The primary outcome assessed was the proportion of participants who experienced seizures in the follow-up period. We presented results as summary risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs for continuous outcomes. Where we had sufficient data, we calculated random-effects (Mantel-Haenszel) meta-analyses for dichotomous outcomes; otherwise, we reported results narratively. We used the I 2 statistic to analyse statistical heterogeneity. We planned to use funnel plots to assess publication bias in meta-analyses with at least 10 included studies. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

Two studies with a total of 856 subjects were included. AEDs were not shown to be effective in primary prophylaxis of post-stroke seizure (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.26; 2 studies, 856 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The first study was a randomised double-blind study comparing valproic acid with placebo for primary seizure prevention up to one year after stroke. The study included 72 adults with intracerebral haemorrhage. There was no difference in the risk of post-stroke seizures (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.16) or of death (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.40 to 3.58). The second study was a substudy on the use of diazepam in acute stroke. It was a randomised double-blind study, comparing a three-day diazepam treatment versus placebo for primary seizure prevention up to three months after stroke in 784 adults with acute stroke. There was no evidence of a difference in the risk of post-stroke seizures for all stroke or subgroups of haemorrhagic or ischaemic stroke (RR for all stroke 0.47, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.22). In a subgroup analysis of anterior circulation cortical infarcts, primary prophylaxis with diazepam was associated with a reduced risk of post-stroke seizures (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.95). Risks of mortality did not differ between the diazepam and the placebo group at two weeks (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.26) and three months follow-up (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.26). We assessed both studies to be at a low overall risk of bias. Using the GRADE approach, we assessed the overall certainty of the evidence as low to moderate.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of AEDs on the primary and secondary prevention of seizures after stroke. Further well-conducted studies are warranted for this important clinical problem.

### Evolving use of seizure medications after intracerebral hemorrhage: a multicenter study [^1153F91c]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Prophylactic medications can be a source of preventable harm, potentially affecting large numbers of patients. Few data exist about how clinicians change prescribing practices in response to new data and revisions to guidelines about preventable harm from a prophylactic medication. We sought to determine the changes in prescribing practice of seizure medications for patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) across a metropolitan area before and after new outcomes data and revised prescribing guidelines were published.

Methods

We conducted an observational study using electronic medical record data from 4 academic medical centers in a large US metropolitan area.

Results

A total of 3,422 patients with ICH, diagnosed between 2007 and 2012, were included. In 2009, after a publication found an association of phenytoin with higher odds of dependence or death, the use of phenytoin declined from 9.6% in 2009 to 2.2% in 2012 (p < 0.00001). Conversely, the use of levetiracetam more than doubled, from 15.1% in 2007 to 35% in 2012 (p < 0.00001). Use of levetiracetam varied among the 4 institutions from 6.7% to 29.8% (p < 0.00001).

Conclusions

New data that led to revised prescribing guidelines for prophylactic seizure medications for patients with ICH were temporally associated with a significant decrease in use of the medication, potentially reducing adverse outcomes. However, a corresponding increase in the use of an alternative medication, levetiracetam, occurred despite limited knowledge about its potential effects on outcomes. Future guideline changes should anticipate and address alternatives.

### Intravenous levetiracetam vs phenytoin for status epilepticus and cluster seizures: a prospective, randomized study [^112simBD]. Seizure (2017). Low credibility.

The study Levetiracetam vs. phenytoin for status epilepticus was published by Arunodaya R Gujjar and colleagues in 2017 in the journal Seizure. This study is related to the following diseases: Status epilepticus and Seizure disorders. In the Levetiracetam vs. phenytoin for status epilepticus study, the trial question was: what is the role of intravenous levetiracetam in patients with status epilepticus? In the Levetiracetam vs. phenytoin for status epilepticus study, the study design was: single center, open label, RCT. In the Levetiracetam vs. phenytoin for status epilepticus study, the population was: 52 patients (18 female, 34 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with status epilepticus, following an initial dose of IV benzodiazepine to control ongoing seizure. The key exclusion criteria were known allergy to drugs used; requiring immediate neurosurgery; hemodynamic compromise; serious arrhythmias; pregnancy; cardiac failure or pulmonary edema; pre-terminal states; having pseudo-seizures. In the Levetiracetam vs. phenytoin for status epilepticus study, the interventions were: n = 22 levetiracetam (intravenous dosage of 30 mg/kg over 30 minutes) n = 30 phenytoin (intravenous dosage of 20 mg/kg over 30 min for status epilepticus and cluster seizures). In the Levetiracetam vs. phenytoin for status epilepticus study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in seizure control over 24 hour (82% vs. 73.3%; RR 1.12, 95% CI -1.11 to 3.35). In the Levetiracetam vs. phenytoin for status epilepticus study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in poor outcome with modified Rankin score 4–6 (45% vs. 60%; RR 0.75, 95% CI -0.63 to 2.13). In the Levetiracetam vs. phenytoin for status epilepticus study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the Levetiracetam vs. phenytoin for status epilepticus study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with status epilepticus, following an initial dose of IV benzodiazepine to control ongoing seizure, levetiracetam was not superior to phenytoin with respect to seizure control over 24 hour.

### Seizures and anticonvulsants after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^116j9qdg]. Neurocritical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Seizures and seizure-like activity may occur in patients experiencing aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Treatment of these events with prophylactic antiepileptic drugs remains controversial. An electronic literature search was conducted for English language articles describing the incidence and treatment of seizures after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage from 1980 to October 2010. A total of 56 articles were included in this review. Seizures often occur at the time of initial presentation or aneurysmal rebleeding before aneurysm treatment. Seizures occur in about 2% of patients after invasive aneurysm treatment, with a higher incidence after surgical clipping compared with endovascular repair. Non-convulsive seizures should be considered in patients with poor neurological status or deterioration. Seizure prophylaxis with antiepileptic drugs is controversial, with limited data available for developing recommendations. While antiepileptic drug use has been linked to worse prognosis, studies have evaluated treatment with almost exclusively phenytoin. When prophylaxis is used, 3-day treatment seems to provide similar seizure prevention with better outcome compared with longer-term treatment.

### Duration and choices of prophylactic anticonvulsants in subarachnoid hemorrhage: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114qckLd]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Medium credibility.

The use of prophylactic anticonvulsants among patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is controversial. We sought to assess the effectiveness of different durations of prophylactic antiepileptic drug (AED) use among SAH patients. We searched the MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases until March 1, 2020. Randomized controlled trials or observational studies comparing different durations or different drugs were selected. The primary outcome was poor clinical outcomes. The secondary outcome was in-hospital seizure. Bayesian network meta-analysis was also performed to indirectly compare the effectiveness of different prophylaxes. A total of 5 papers were included. Three studies with a total of 959 patients were included in the analysis of the primary outcome; the results showed that long-term exposure to prophylactic AEDs (more than 3 days) led to poor clinical outcomes (OR 1.55; 95% CI 1.01–2.39; p = 0.045). Four studies with 1024 patients were included in the analysis of the secondary outcome; the results showed no association between the duration of prophylactic AED use and the occurrence of in-hospital seizures (OR 0.62; 95% CI 0.18–2.15; p = 0.447). In the network meta-analysis, no significant difference was found among the four different prophylaxes. Our findings suggested that, when compared with the short-term use, the long-term use of prophylactic AEDs in SAH patients has a similar effect on in-hospital seizure prevention but is associated with poor clinical outcomes. However, these findings were based on a small number of available studies with obvious heterogeneity in study design and different prescription regimens. Further well-designed studies are warranted to elucidate these questions.

### Guidelines for seizure prophylaxis in patients hospitalized with nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage: a clinical practice guideline for health care professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society [^115WUQXU]. Neurocritical Care (2025). High credibility.

Intracerebral hemorrhage ASM versus no ASM — mortality across six studies (n = 3,469), including two RCTs (n = 120) and four non‑RCT studies of mixed ASMs versus placebo (n = 3,349), showed overall no difference between those who received an ASM and those who did not (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.73–1.14, P = 0.43; I^2 = 53%, P = 0.06 for heterogeneity); in pooled adjusted analyses from two retrospective studies, there was no difference in the adjusted risk of death (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.43–1.69, P = 0.66; I^2 = 79%, P = 0.03 for heterogeneity).

### Anticonvulsant use and outcomes after intracerebral hemorrhage [^1171hXEW]. Stroke (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

There are few data on the effectiveness and side effects of antiepileptic drug therapy after intracerebral hemorrhage. We tested the hypothesis that antiepileptic drug use is associated with more complications and worse outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage.

Methods

We prospectively enrolled 98 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage and recorded antiepileptic drug use as either prophylactic or therapeutic along with clinical characteristics. Antiepileptic drug administration and free phenytoin serum levels were retrieved from the electronic medical records. Patients with depressed mental status underwent continuous electroencephalographic monitoring. Outcomes were measured with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and modified Rankin Scale at 14 days or discharge and the modified Rankin Scale at 28 days and 3 months. We constructed logistic regression models for poor outcome at 3 months with a forward conditional model.

Results

Seven (7%) patients had a clinical seizure, 5 on the day of intracerebral hemorrhage. Phenytoin was associated with more fever (P = 0.03), worse National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale at 14 days (23 [9 to 42] versus 11 [4 to 23], P = 0.003), and worse modified Rankin Scale at 14 days, 28 days, and 3 months. In a forward conditional logistic regression model, phenytoin prophylaxis was associated with an increased risk of poor outcome (OR, 9.8; 1.4 to 68.6; P = 0.02), entering after admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and age. Excluding patients with a seizure did not change the results. Levetiracetam was not associated with demographics, seizures, complications, or outcomes.

Conclusions

Phenytoin was associated with more fever and worse outcomes after intracerebral hemorrhage.

### Intravenous levetiracetam vs phenytoin for status epilepticus and cluster seizures: a prospective, randomized study [^115uCuTV]. Seizure (2017). Low credibility.

The study Levetiracetam vs. phenytoin for cluster seizures was published by Arunodaya R Gujjar and colleagues in 2017 in the journal Seizure. This study is related to the following diseases: Seizure disorders. In the Levetiracetam vs. phenytoin for cluster seizures study, the trial question was: what is the role of intravenous levetiracetam in patients with cluster seizures? In the Levetiracetam vs. phenytoin for cluster seizures study, the study design was: single center, open label, RCT. In the Levetiracetam vs. phenytoin for cluster seizures study, the population was: 63 patients (19 female, 44 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with cluster seizures, following an initial dose of IV benzodiazepine to control ongoing seizure. The key exclusion criteria were known allergy to drugs used; requiring immediate neurosurgery; hemodynamic compromise; serious arrhythmias; pregnancy; cardiac failure or pulmonary edema; pre-terminal states; having pseudo-seizures. In the Levetiracetam vs. phenytoin for cluster seizures study, the interventions were: n = 38 levetiracetam (intravenous dosage of 30 mg/kg over 30 minutes) n = 25 phenytoin (intravenous dosage of 20 mg/kg over 30 min for status epilepticus and cluster seizures). In the Levetiracetam vs. phenytoin for cluster seizures study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in seizure control over 24 hour (81.6% vs. 80%; RR 1.02, 95% CI -10.33 to 12.37). In the Levetiracetam vs. phenytoin for cluster seizures study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in poor outcome with modified Rankin score 4–6 (21% vs. 44%; RR 0.48, 95% CI 0 to 0.96). In the Levetiracetam vs. phenytoin for cluster seizures study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the Levetiracetam vs. phenytoin for cluster seizures study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with cluster seizures, following an initial dose of IV benzodiazepine to control ongoing seizure, levetiracetam was not superior to phenytoin with respect to seizure control over 24 hour.

### A systematic appraisal of neurosurgical seizure prophylaxis: guidance for critical care management [^111D8dze]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical decisions are often made in the presence of some uncertainty. Health care should be based on a combination of scientific evidence, clinical experience, economics, patient value judgments, and preferences. Seizures are not uncommon following brain injury, surgical trauma, hemorrhage, altered brain metabolism, hypoxia, or ischemic events. The impact of seizures in the immediate aftermath of injury may be a prolonged intensive care stay or compounding of the primary injury. The aim of brain injury management is to limit the consequences of the secondary damage. The original intention of seizure prophylaxis was to limit the incidence of early-onset seizures. However, clinical trials have been equivocal on this point, and there is concern about the adverse effects of antiepileptic drug therapy. This review of the literature raises concerns regarding the arbitrary division of seizures into early onset (7 d) and late onset (8 d and beyond). In many cases it would appear that seizures present within 24 hours of the injury or after 7 days, which would be outside of the scope of current seizure prophylaxis guidance. There also does not appear to be a pathophysiological reason to divide brain injury-related seizures into these timeframes. Therefore, a solution to the conundrum is to reevaluate current practice. Prophylaxis could be offered to those receiving intensive care for the primary brain injury, where the impact of seizure would be detrimental to the management of the brain injury, or other clinical judgments where prophylaxis is prudent. Neurosurgical seizure management can then focus attention on which agent has the best adverse effect profile and the duration of therapy. The evidence seems to support levetiracetam as the most appropriate agent. Although previous reviews have identified an increase cost associated with the use of levetiracetam, current cost comparisons with phenytoin demonstrate a marginal price differential. The aim of this review is to assimilate the applicable literature regarding seizure prophylaxis. The final guidance is a forum upon which further clinical research could evaluate a new seizure prophylaxis paradigm.

### Critical care management of patients following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: recommendations from the Neurocritical Care Society's multidisciplinary consensus conference [^112BTpYo]. Neurocritical Care (2011). Medium credibility.

Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage — seizures and prophylactic anticonvulsant use is characterized by low initial seizure rates and conditional prophylaxis guidance: Clinical seizures are uncommon after the initial aneurysm rupture (occurring in 1–7% of patients) and risk factors for the development of seizures in SAH are surgical aneurysm repair in patients ≥ 65 years of age, thick subarachnoid clot, and possibly intraparenchymal hematoma or infarction. Prophylactic treatment with anticonvulsants in SAH patients without seizures has previously been commonplace, although no randomized trials specifically addressing this issue have been performed, and recent studies have suggested that anticonvulsant use is associated with worsened long-term outcome after SAH; thus, prophylactic anticonvulsant therapy with phenytoin may worsen outcome. In patients with no history of seizure, a short course (7 d) of anticonvulsant prophylaxis seems as effective as a more prolonged course in preventing seizures, and in comatose (poor-grade) SAH patients, non-convulsive seizures may be detected on continuous EEG in 10–20% of cases; while patients with non-convulsive seizures have a worsened outcome, the impact of successful treatment and the influence of anticonvulsant prophylaxis on their occurrence has not been studied. There was consensus that routine prophylactic phenytoin use should not be undertaken after SAH; a short course (3–7 days) of anticonvulsant prophylaxis may still be considered in certain situations, especially if an agent other than phenytoin was used. There was also agreement that patients who suffer a clear clinical seizure after the period of aneurysmal rupture should be treated with anticonvulsants, but that if seizures do not recur, these anticonvulsants should be discontinued after 3–6 months, and there was consensus that cEEG is probably underutilized in poor-grade SAH patients with general agreement that one or perhaps two anticonvulsants should be used to attempt to treat non-convulsive seizures identified on cEEG.

### Levetiracetam versus (fos) phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis in pediatric patients with intracranial hemorrhage [^115T4TL6]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Object

Seizure prophylaxis is used in a variety of conditions, including supratentorial intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). In adults, studies have demonstrated phenytoin as the drug of choice for seizure prophylaxis; in children, levetiracetam is often provided due to its favorable side effect profile and pharmacokinetics. This study evaluated the difference in efficacy between these treatment options.

Methods

This retrospective review included 126 patients between 1 month and 17 years of age with acute supratentorial ICH; all received seizure prophylaxis. Demographic data and outcome assessments were compared.

Results

Seizure prophylaxis was provided with (fos)phenytoin in 40 children, levetiracetam in 61 children, and both drugs in 25 patients. Baseline characteristics of the treatment groups were similar, except that more patients treated with (fos)phenytoin had seizures on presentation. Patients treated solely with (fos)phenytoin had a higher probability of early seizures (within 7 days of ICH) compared with those treated only with LVT, controlling for relevant variables including seizures on presentation (OR 24.6, p = 0.002). Patients treated with (fos)phenytoin were more likely to need additional antiepileptic drugs for seizure control (p = 0.005). There was no significant difference in the incidence of late seizures (> 7 days after ICH) (p = 0.265). Adverse events necessitating a change in therapy were uncommon.

Conclusions

Levetiracetam is a reasonable alternative to (fos)phenytoin for prophylaxis of early posthemorrhagic seizures. Levetiracetam and (fos)phenytoin are well tolerated in children. Prospective studies are needed to determine superiority, optimal dosing, and impact on long-term outcomes.

### Early seizure prophylaxis in traumatic brain injuries revisited: a prospective observational study [^111QCbV2]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pharmacological prophylaxis for early seizures following traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a recommendation in the Brain Trauma Foundation Guidelines. However, several studies have challenged the efficacy and safety of this practice, resulting in varied practice across centers around the world. The purpose of the present study was to compare the incidence of early clinical seizures following TBI, between two large centers, a US Center that practises routine seizure prophylaxis and a Chinese Center that does not use seizure prophylaxis following TBI.

Patients and Methods

This was a prospective observational study including an urban level I trauma center in the United States and a large hospital in Shenzhen, China. At the US Center, all patients received seizure prophylaxis with levetiracetam. At the Chinese Center, no seizure prophylaxis was given. All patients with blunt TBI and positive computed tomography findings for epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage or diffuse axonal injury were included. Patients who died within 24 h of admission were excluded. The study population was monitored daily for clinical seizures for the first 7 post-injury days. Data collected included demographics, mechanism of injury, vital signs upon arrival, injury severity and emergency interventions. Primary outcome was the incidence of early seizures, defined as those occurring within 7 days of injury.

Results

A total of 522 patients were included in the analysis: 272 patients at the US Center who received seizure prophylaxis and 250 patients at the Chinese Center who did not receive prophylaxis. Overall, 3.7% of patients who received seizure prophylaxis developed early seizures, compared to 2.8% of patients who did not receive any prophylaxis (p = 0.573). Decompressive craniectomy was associated with the highest incidence of early seizure (9.2%). In this subgroup, the seizure rate was 10.4% in the prophylaxis group and 7.1% in the no-prophylaxis group (p = 0.738). Patients with admission GCS < 9 had an overall early seizure incidence of 7.0%: 4.3% in the prophylaxis group and 14.3% in the no-prophylaxis group (p = 0.062). Analysis of the subgroup with isolated blunt TBI showed an incidence of early seizures of 3.4% in the prophylaxis group versus 2.4% in the no-prophylaxis group (p = 0.593). Further analyses of outcomes according to head AIS 3, 4 and 5 showed no significant difference in the seizure rate between the two groups: head AIS 3: 6.1% in the prophylaxis group versus 2.6% in the no-prophylaxis group, p = 0.329; head AIS 4: 0 versus 2.7%, p = 0.302; head AIS 5: 8.7 versus 4.0%, p = 0.601.

Conclusions

The present study failed to show any benefit of routine early seizure prophylaxis following blunt TBI. This practice should be reexamined in a large randomized clinical study.

Practice patterns — EEG monitoring and ASM use in ICH: Most panel members perform continuous EEG monitoring and consider primary ASM prophylaxis in patients with high-risk EEG features, including the presence of epileptiform discharges, and all panel members reported that they treat clinical or electrographic seizures with ASM and often continue EEG monitoring for a longer duration with continuous video EEG or repeated intermittent EEG. If an ASM is used for seizure prophylaxis, all panel members noted a preference for LEV over PHT, and if an ASM were used for a patient without clinical seizure or high-risk EEG features, all panel members reported that they would minimize the duration of use to ≤ 7 days.

### Impact of anti-epileptic drug choice on discharge in acute traumatic brain injury patients [^116jZLK1]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

This is a retrospective observational study; a randomised-controlled trial comparing Phenytoin versus Levetiracetam would provide higher quality data with more definitive findings. It is difficult to truly eliminate confounding variables, including co-morbidities, surgical requirement, social issues, and hospital acquired complications. We have attempted to do so by including only TBI cases with a length of stay less than 3 weeks. However, this means that we can only look at differences in length of stay when the overall duration was under 3 weeks. We recognise that our study was conducted on patients with a GCS 14–15, where dizziness could accurately be assessed, whereas the guidelines for AEDs in TBI are for those patients with severe TBI and GCS < 8. It is clear that AEDs are often prescribed for minor TBI based on clinician choice and it is this cohort that contributed. Whether the AED was indicated at all in these patients was beyond the scope of this study. Specific examination findings, including neurological gait dysfunction and the rate of encephalopathy, were not included in this retrospective study. Despite this, we believe that our study represents an accurate comparison of Phenytoin and Levetiracetam and their impact upon dizziness and length of stay.

Recent studies have suggested that prophylactic Levetiracetam for patients with intracerebral haemorrhage was independently associated with lower cognitive function on follow-up. We hope to assess the extent that prophylactic AEDs in TBI impacts long-term cognitive function in future work. This study provides preliminary data for larger studies looking at AEDs in post-TBI seizure prophylaxis and its impact upon duration of admission and the potential impact upon healthcare expenditure. Additionally, further study may help to assess the impact on post-discharge recovery. Dizziness post-TBI is an independent risk factor for delayed return-to-work in TBI. Hence, AEDs that impact upon balance functioning may also affect return-to-work rates for the young patient group who are disproportionately affected by TBI.

Seizure prophylaxis

Continuous electroencephalography (EEG) is routinely used to monitor patients presenting with post-traumatic seizures (PTS), at increased risk of subclinical seizures or those who are pharmacologically paralyzed. The Brain Trauma Foundation Guidelines suggest that in severe TBI, the rate of clinical PTS may be as high as 12%, while that of subclinical seizures may be as high as 20–25%. There is additional interest in detecting cortical spreading depression as an additional injurious mechanism; however this is reliant on electrodes applied surgically directly to the cortical surface. This has limited the ability to detect CSD systematically.

The BTF Guidelines reinstated the role of post-traumatic seizure prophylaxis with either phenytoin or levetiracetam within 7 days of injury (level IIA recommendation), with particular attention to adverse drug reactions. Benefits from PTS prophylaxis are both acute (limitation of neurophysiological derangements and prevention of herniation) and chronic (prevention of chronic epilepsy for which TBI patients are at higher risk). A meta-analysis from 2012 showed no significant difference in post-traumatic seizure rates when comparing treatment with phenytoin and levetiracetam in pooled studies. Since then, another large prospective RCT found no difference in rates of early post-traumatic seizures between the patient group treated with phenytoin and the other, with leviteracetam. Long-term disadvantages from anti-convulsant use on neuropsychological recovery in relation with timing and dosage are not yet fully understood and merit further prospective evaluation.

### Pathophysiology, diagnosis, prognosis, and prevention of poststroke epilepsy: clinical and research implications [^112uTVJr]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Antiepileptogenesis trials are challenging, and evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for the effectiveness of primary prophylaxis with ASMs is insufficient. The European Stroke Organization guidelines suggest against the general primary ASM prophylaxis administration owing to sparse reliable evidence. Four completed antiepileptogenesis trials meet the current standards of an RCT design.
In a randomized double-blind study comparing 1-month valproic acid treatment and placebo each administered 2 hours after stroke onset for primary seizure prevention, including 72 adults with intracerebral hemorrhage, the risk of poststroke seizures up to 1 year (relative risk [RR] 0.88; 95% CI 0.35–2.16) or death (RR 1.20; 95% CI 0.40–3.58) did not differ.
In a randomized double-blind study comparing a 3-day diazepam treatment with a placebo for primary seizure prevention up to 3 months after stroke in 784 adults with acute stroke, there was no evidence of a difference in the risk of poststroke seizures for all stroke groups and subgroups of hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke (RR for all stroke, 0.47; 95% CI 0.18–1.22). In a subgroup analysis of anterior circulation cortical infarcts, primary prophylaxis with diazepam was associated with a reduced risk of poststroke seizures (RR 0.21; 95% CI 0.05–0.95). Mortality risks did not differ between the diazepam and placebo groups at the 2-week (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.56–0.26) and 3-month (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.72–1.26) follow-ups.
In a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of Early Treatment with Levetiracetam After Stroke for the prevention of late seizures, only 16 patients (levetiracetam [LEV], n = 9; placebo, n = 7) were included, and only 1 patient (placebo group) developed PSE. Recognizing and assessing the occurrence of epileptic seizures was difficult because benzodiazepines and ASMs were prescribed mainly by other treating physicians, and adverse effects might have been related to the stroke or comedication initiated before or at the onset of stroke rather than the study medication. A prophylactic study assessing the antiepileptogenic efficacy of a short ASM treatment period may not be feasible owing to the challenge in recruiting a sufficient number of participants or determining PSE seizure episodes.
Most recently, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial (PEACH) showed significant LEV effects in preventing electrographic seizures in acute phase (≤ 72 hours) of ICH but did not prevent clinical seizure manifestations, reflecting the formation of epileptogenesis.

### Guidelines for seizure prophylaxis in adults hospitalized with moderate-severe traumatic brain injury: a clinical practice guideline for health care professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society [^111NqpE9]. Neurocritical Care (2024). High credibility.

Neurocritical Care Society guideline — seizure prophylaxis for adults hospitalized with moderate–severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) — states that we suggest that ASM or no ASM may be used in patients hospitalized with moderate−severe TBI (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). If an antiseizure medication (ASM) is used, we suggest levetiracetam (LEV) over phenytoin/fosphenytoin (PHT/fPHT) (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence) for a short duration (≤ 7 days, weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). The evidence synthesis found no significant positive or negative effect of ASM compared to no ASM on the outcomes of early seizure, late seizure, adverse events, or mortality; no significant positive or negative effect of PHT/fPHT compared to LEV for early seizures or mortality, though point estimates suggest fewer late seizures and fewer adverse events with LEV; and no significant differences in early or late seizures with longer versus shorter ASM use, though cognitive outcomes and adverse events appear worse with protracted use. Duration comparisons were specified as long versus short (> 7 vs. ≤ 7 days).

TBI PICO 2 — levetiracetam (LEV) versus phenytoin (PHT) to prevent late seizure (> 14 Days of TBI Onset or Post Hospitalization): A meta-analysis included three studies with 208 patients, of which one was a randomized controlled trial (N = 135) and two were nonrandomized controlled trials (N = 73). Overall, across studies there was marginal significance favoring LEV (RR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.30–1.00, P = 0.05), with the randomized controlled study significantly favoring LEV (0.36, 95% CI 0.15–0.86, P = 0.02); heterogeneity across studies was not significant (I^2 = 0%, P = 0.41) and between study designs was I^2 = 39.7%, P = 0.20. Two additional randomized controlled trials comparing valproate to PHT (N = 379) or PHT to phenobarbital (N = 105) saw no significant difference in late seizures (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.72–2.08, P = 0.45; RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.31–5.38, P = 0.72).

### Should levetiracetam or phenytoin Be used for posttraumatic seizure prophylaxis? A systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis [^112o7X3F]. Neurosurgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Posttraumatic seizure (PTS) is a significant complication of traumatic brain injury (TBI).

Objective

To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare levetiracetam with phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis in patients diagnosed with severe TBI.

Methods

An inclusive search of several electronic databases and bibliographies was conducted to identify scientific studies that compared the effect of levetiracetam and phenytoin on PTS. Independent reviewers obtained data and classified the quality of each article that met inclusion criteria. A random effects meta-analysis was then completed.

Results

During June and July 2015, a systematic literature search was performed that identified 6097 articles. Of these, 7 met inclusion criteria. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed. A total of 1186 patients were included. The rate of seizure was 35 of 654 (5.4%) in the levetiracetam cohort and 18 of 532 (3.4%) in the phenytoin cohort. Our meta-analysis revealed no change in the rate of early PTS with levetiracetam compared with phenytoin (relative risk, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 0.53–1.95; p = 0.96).

Conclusion

The lack of evidence on which antiepileptic drug to use in PTS is surprising given the number of patients prescribed an antiepileptic drug therapy for TBI. On the basis of currently available Level III evidence, patients treated with either levetiracetam or phenytoin have similar incidences of early seizures after TBI.

TBI PICO 2 — levetiracetam (LEV) versus phenytoin (PHT) to prevent early seizure (≤ 14 Days from TBI Onset or During Hospitalization) in patients hospitalized with moderate–severe TBI: A meta-analysis included ten studies with 1741 patients, comprising three randomized controlled trials (N = 342) and seven nonrandomized controlled trials (N = 1399). Overall, there was no significant reduction in early seizure with LEV compared to PHT (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.84–1.36, P = 0.58), with no significant heterogeneity across studies (I^2 = 0%, P = 0.52). An additional randomized controlled trial comparing valproate to PHT (N = 379) saw no significant difference in the rate of early seizures between these two ASMs (RR 2.94, 95% CI 0.79–10.86, P = 0.11).

### Interim safety profile from the feasibility study of the brainGate neural interface system [^113oGukb]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Two participants, both of whom had a history of traumatic brain injury in addition to SCI, had seizures in the postimplantation period. In one case, the participant was noted intraoperatively to have a small but nonetheless atypical quantity (approximately 2 mL) of subarachnoid hemorrhage around 1 of the 2 implanted arrays. Four days later, he experienced 2 self-limited focal motor seizures, for which he was hospitalized and treated with levetiracetam. He continued levetiracetam as an outpatient, experienced no further seizures, and subsequently participated in the trial for 17 months without any other neurologic AEs. This participant had not received a prophylactic antiseizure medication postoperatively because this practice had not yet been incorporated into the study protocol. Another participant had a single seizure on postoperative day 4; he too was admitted to the hospital, started on levetiracetam, and had no further seizures. He remains enrolled in the clinical trial and has been participating in research sessions for more than 2 years. He had been prescribed a prophylactic antiseizure medication, but 2 doses were missed during the transition from hospital to home. These participants' prior traumatic brain injuries were believed to have increased their risk for seizures.

### Levetiracetam versus fosphenytoin as a second-line treatment after diazepam for adult convulsive status epilepticus: a multicentre non-inferiority randomised control trial [^116DyzDv]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

The present study had several limitations. Physicians who treated patients and performed outcome assessments were not blinded. While the dose of phenytoin was 22.5 mg/kg, that of LEV ranged between 1000 mg and 3000 mg according to the Japanese epilepsy guidelines. The seizure cessation rate within 30 min, the primary outcome of this study, was high in both the LEV and FPHT groups. In contrast to previous studies in which only patients with SE uncontrolled by benzodiazepine were enrolled, we administered second-line drugs after diazepam irrespective of seizure cessation with diazepam. This practice is recommended in the SE guidelines in Japan and other countries, and is the most frequently performed treatment for SE in emergency rooms. Patients whose SE may have stopped with diazepam only may have been included in the patient sample; however, the seizure cessation rate within 24 hours as the secondary outcome was affected by the study drugs because diazepam lost its efficacy within a few minutes. As the other reason, this study was conducted in general emergency and critical care centres, most of which were not the epilepsy centres to which many patients with refractory SE were transported in previous RCTs. Many elderly patients with SE caused by cerebral strokes were included in this study, which may have affected efficacy and safety. Furthermore, we did not diagnose SE with EEG, similar to previous RCTs on SE. Epilepsy-mimicking diseases, such as psychiatric paroxysmal attacks, were included in the present study. We need to simultaneously exclude non-convulsive SE in future studies. Moreover, treatments other than the study drugs were not defined. Since each physician selected the doses of diazepam and the study drugs, there may have been unknown confounding factors.

### Seizure prophylaxis in traumatic brain injury… [^116sQ37a]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Objective To determine the association between seizure prophylaxis and risk reduction for early PTS in mild and moderate TBI. Data Sources PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science were systematically searched. Study Selection Observational studies of adult patients presenting to trauma centers in high-income countries with mild and moderate TBI comparing rates of early PTS among patients with seizure prophylaxis with those without seizure prophylaxis. Because of this practice variation, unknown effectiveness, and large potential for clinical impact, we sought to determine through a quantitative meta-analysis the association between seizure prophylaxis and risk reduction for early PTS in patients with mild and moderate TBI presenting to trauma centers in high-income countries.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analyses using accepted evidence-based techniques and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses reporting guidelines. 35 Our protocol was registered with PROSPERO.
36. For studies of patients with mild and moderate TBI, the ARR with prophylaxis in early PTS was
0. 6%. The rates of early PTS ranged from 0% to 4%, depending on the study. When only including mild TBI, the ARR of seizure prophylaxis for early PTS was also 0. 6%. There was a similar amount of heterogeneity with a negative Cochran Q test, and I2 was insignificant. Visual analysis of the funnel plot showed minimal risk of publication bias.

Although this meta-analysis did show a modest yet clear associated risk reduction of early seizures using prophylaxis with antiseizure medications in mild and moderate TBI, the relatively small ARR coupled with the low incidence of PTS in these populations makes the decision to use seizure prophylaxis in nonsevere TBI challenging. We encourage practitioners to carefully weigh the prevalence and risks of early seizures against potential adverse events from antiseizure medications.

### Spreading depolarization: a possible new culprit in the delayed cerebral ischemia of subarachnoid hemorrhage… [^116N262E]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

Fisher scale III hemorrhages demonstrated no difference in clinical outcomes between the treatment and control groups. 27 To date, the 1 drug that has consistently decreased the risk of death, disability, and delayed ischemia after SAH is nimodipine. 28 Initially thought to target vasospasm and therefore prevent DCI., it has subsequently been shown to have no effect on the development of vasospasm after SAH. 29 Interestingly, nicardipine, another calcium channel blocker, appears to reduce vasospasm but has no effect on clinical outcome. 28, 29 Most recently, attention has been directed toward endothelin, a potent endogenous vasoconstrictor and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of vasospasm. In experimental models of SAH, endothelin receptor antagonists demonstrated the ability to reduce vasospasm.

30 Although an initial trial with a nonselective endothelin receptor antagonist demonstrated no difference in cerebral infarction rates or clinical outcomes, 31 it was suggested that the lack of effect could result from inhibition of both endothelin A and endothelin B receptors, which have opposing effects on vascular tone, endothelin A mediating vasoconstrictor and endothelin B vasodilatation. Therefore, it was hypothesized that a selective endothelin A receptor antagonist may have a benefit. Two trials were conducted using the endothelin A receptor antagonist clazosentan. The preliminary phase 2a study32 demonstrated reduction of angiographic vasospasm. In the follow-up CONSCIOUS-1 study, 33 which involved 413 patients, a dose-dependent reduction of angiographic vasospasm was observed. Nimodipine has been shown in animal studies to correct the inverse hemodynamic response of CSD under pathologic conditions.

45 However, at the doses and formulation used currently in patients with SAH, it is does not prevent all CSDs. 10, 50 Some potential targets for the suppression of CSD include N -methyl-D-aspartic acid antagonists, correction of cerebral glucose, and hyperoxia. N -methyl-D-aspartic acid antagonists alter CSDs and reduce the hypoperfusion associated with the inverse hemodynamic response. 41 However, N -methyl-D-aspartic acid antagonists may not be as effective in damaged tissue. 10, 39 Reduced glucose levels trigger CSDs experimentally.

3) aggressive, consisting of long-term primary prophylaxis; and risk guided, consisting of short-term secondary early-seizure prophylaxis among low-risk patients, short-term primary prophylaxis among patients at higher risk, and long-term secondary therapy for late seizure. prophylaxis after early seizure among low-risk patients, short-term primary prophylaxis among higher-risk patients, and long-term secondary therapy after late seizure. 11 We aimed to answer which option is associated with the greatest net benefit, measured as expected quality-adjusted life-years. The bleeding does not implicate the cortex. Her CAVE score is 0 if she does not develop an early seizure and 1 if she does. She has multiple comorbidities treated with polypharmacy and a high ADR risk, which imposes a significant decrease in QOL. Her age-adjusted life expectancy is 3. 7 years. His age-adjusted life expectancy is 17 years. A 45-year-old woman at high risk for late seizure with high ADR risk and low ADR utility presents with lobar sICH and cortical involvement. Her NIHSS score is 22 and her ICH score is 2. She has hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Our decision analysis indicates the advantages of short-term antiseizure drug strategies across a spectrum of clinical scenarios for patients presenting with incident sICH. This finding underscores the importance of early discontinuation of antiseizure drug strategies initiated for early-seizure prophylaxis.

Moreover, we recommend a risk-based approach using the 2HELPS2B score to guide clinical decision on initiation of primary vs secondary early-seizure prophylaxis for all patients after sICH, assuming timely availability of EEG.
